<p><p>As a U.S. taxpayer I would object to my funds being given to a
<br>
foreign company for this purpose, local workers exempted. If
<br>
companies in other countries want the business/charity work, let
<br>
them convince their governments to shell out the Bucks/Marks.
<br>
Peso's whatever.
<br>
<p>### If you already decided to give the money to benefit others, why insist
<br>
on a less efficient way of spending it? But I do not force my point of view
<br>
here. The payer should decide what to do with his money.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p>Part of the U.S.'s problem in the world is simple PR. During the
<br>
holidays I was watching TV as a man in Afghanistan was criticizing
<br>
the U.S. with a bag of wheat clearly labeled &quot;USA&quot; slung over his
<br>
shoulder. Had I been standing there I would have &quot;pulled a
<br>
Giuliani&quot;, dragged it away from him with an explanation as to why,
<br>
and told him to try eating dirt.
<br>
<p>In marketspeak the U.S needs to push it's brand, and quit catering
<br>
to the prejudices of the rest of the world.
<br>
<p>### Yes, I agree.
<br>
