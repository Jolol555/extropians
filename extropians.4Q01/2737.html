This was recently on a humor list I subscribe to:
<br>
<p>--------------
<br>
<p>Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500
<br>
employees and has the following statistics:
<br>
*29 have been accused of spousal abuse
<br>
*7 have been arrested for fraud
<br>
*19 have been accused of writing bad checks
<br>
*117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least two businesses
<br>
*3 have done time for assault
<br>
*71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit
<br>
*14 have been arrested on drug-related charges
<br>
*8 have been arrested for shoplifting
<br>
*21 are currently defendants in lawsuits
<br>
*84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year
<br>
Can you guess which organization this is?
<br>
Give up?
<br>

Its the 535 members of the United States Congress. The same group of
<br>
idiots
<br>
that crank out hundreds of new laws each year designed to keep the rest
<br>
of
<br>
the US in line!!!
<br>
<p>--------------
<br>
<p>Not exactly funny I know. :-/
<br>
As you know I am not a fan of government, though I see some value in 
<br>
keeping it as a counterbalance to the crazy power to some of the nastier
<br>
<p>corporations, but geez this had me wondering a bit...
<br>
<p>Our current crop of slimeballs got re-elected here in Oz... almost makes
<br>
me 
<br>
lose my normal optimism. Ugh! What kind of respect can a country get if
<br>
it 
<br>
has a prime minister who appears to be Kermit the frog's uglier,
<br>
nastier, 
<br>
racist cousin?
<br>
<p>Cheers,

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
