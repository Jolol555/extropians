<p>
Since you asked--as I mentioned awhile back I recently spent several
<br>
days going through the personal correspondence of L. Sprague DeCamp,
<br>
which ended up at the University of Texas largely because Catherine
<br>
DeCamp had fallen in love with a house in Plano, Texas (which, along
<br>
with other Dallas suburbs like Duncanville, is the real-life model
<br>
for &quot;King of the Hill's&quot; Arlen) and some SF freaks at UT's Humanities
<br>
Research Center arranged to purchase the letters, allowing the DeCamps
<br>
to spend their retirement in a place I wouldn't live in without 
<br>
massive infusions of cash and drugs, but I digress.
<br>
<p>DeCamp kept files of every letter he wrote and received and at one
<br>
time or another he corresponded with an amazing variety of people,
<br>
from Jack Parsons to John Ciardi to Harold T. Wilkins (the latter
<br>
mad as a hatter, judging from his letters). It was a genuinely
<br>
fascinating plow-through--hey, did you know that DeCamp and Heinlein
<br>
shared an interest in nude photography? And the Hydras' gossip was
<br>
great, particularly the portions concerning that philandering
<br>
speed-freak Ted Sturgeon.
<br>
<p>I only transcribed a small portion of it all, but I couldn't resist
<br>
pulling some toothsome quotes from Eric Frank Russell. For context,
<br>
you need to know that DeCamp was a proto-Randi, not just proud but
<br>
smug about his 'skepticism'.
<br>
<p>Eric Frank Russell to Decamp, 12/18/51: &quot;It's a new one on me that
<br>
Thayer is 'pro-Velikovsky.' I wouldn't go so far as to say that!
<br>
He runs 'Doubt' and the F.S.[Fortean Society] very much as a home for lost
<br>
causes, crackpot or otherwise, on the perfectly logical principle that
<br>
there are two sides to every issue and the 'unpopular' or 'unorthodox'
<br>
side is always worthy if consideration. Had dogmatic science whooped
<br>
it up in Velikovsky's favor, instead of damning him, Thayer would
<br>
have been 'anti-Vel.' Call it perversity if you like...but it seems
<br>
to be that it's a small body of highly vocal and incurably perverse
<br>
people who prevent the authoritative from getting away with attempts
<br>
to establish mental dictatorship. For that reason if no other, I'm
<br>
all for Thayer.&quot;
<br>
<p>Eric Frank Russell to DeCamp, 3/1/52: &quot;I don't think Thayer or the
<br>
Fortean Society is [sic] as extreme as you suggest. The idea is
<br>
not to stubbornly disbelieve anything on sight, the more authoritative
<br>
the better. Rather it is to persuade folk - particularly the credulous
<br>
ones - to cast aside belief in favor of temporary acceptance. That is
<br>
to say to accept with mental reservations that it might yet prove to
<br>
be wholly or partly wrong.
<br>
<p>In my experience, that's an attitude of mind usually taken up by
<br>
intelligent folk. But where intelligent people such as yourself
<br>
frequently make a great mistake is in this respect: that when
<br>
thinking of humanity in the mass, especially on some idealistic
<br>
matter, you fall into the error of thinking them as intelligent
<br>
as yourself. THEY ARE NOT! An appalling percentage of the general
<br>
run of humanity is dopey, illiterate and thoroughly credulous. That's
<br>
not to say they're without virtue; quite the contrary. They can be
<br>
loyal, generous, good-hearted, etc etc, but still lacking in brain-
<br>
power or the ability to use the brains they've got. It's a minor
<br>
triumph for the Fortean Society when we persuade a formerly convinced
<br>
Roman Catholic to view the doctrine of Papal infallibility as fit
<br>
subject for suspicion. And the doctrine of scientific fallibility
<br>
gets the same treatment. Rightly so, because the status of a scientist
<br>
does not put a man above the moral law, neither does it give him the
<br>
right to be preserved from criticism. A scientist is only a man,
<br>
complete with pants and a fat ass inside them. There are no academic 
<br>
qualifications that can make him something more than a mere man. The
<br>
attitude of the F.S. is like that of the child in Hans Andersen's
<br>
&quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot; - we just refuse to see what isn't there.
<br>
Especially haloes, scientific or theological.&quot;
