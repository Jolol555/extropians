<p>Perhaps the role of anarcho-whateveritists is as the loyal opposition,
<br>
the foil to concentrations of power... but to be effective at that, we
<br>
cannot focus solely on governments and ignore the other main power
<br>
base in our world. That's the main point.

</em><br>
<p>This is what I call the Apollo Argument, which is what prevented me
<br>
from accepting anarcho-libertarian memes until late into my college
<br>
years. The argument is: &quot;Could anarchists have pulled off the Apollo
<br>
Program?&quot;
<br>
<p>Observing the spontaneous emergence of the open source movement, we
<br>
now have an answer for this question: &quot;Yes, anarchists can create
<br>
things of a complexity on the same order as the Apollo Program,
<br>
provided the barriers to entry are sufficiently low.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; enough to spend $75 Million constructing a Terascale/TeraGrid

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would be able to effectively or optimally allocate their tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars between the NIH and the DoD???  You are an Extropian (presumably)
</em><br>
<p>Hey! Hey now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and that means you want to optimize the production of complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extending lives does that -- but you have to do that by balancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the allocation of resources against resisting those unthinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microbes trying to rob you for reproductive materials with the thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts of people who are trying to destroy you because you disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with their fundamental philosophies.
</em><br>
<p>I know what you're saying, and it's a dilemma I struggle with, and
<br>
have raised in earlier posts. It boils down to: under a perfect free
<br>
market system, without entrenched interests, corruption, bureaucracy,
<br>
ignorance, and friction resources would be distributed far more evenly
<br>
than they are now... however, are we sure that equal distribution won't
<br>
result in *slower* progress toward extropic goals?
<br>
<p>I don't have a comprehensive answer for this.
<br>
<p>One response is that just as desires that are pointless outside the
<br>
the context of their evolutionary origins motivate humans,
<br>
corporations can be equally short-sighted and equally capable of
<br>
blundering into a giant civilizational dead-end. Perhaps more so,
<br>
given that their power appears to increase faster than their vision.
<br>
<p>Another response is that the interests backing the status quo are
<br>
sufficiently powerful to prevent a shift all the way to the &quot;people's
<br>
capitalism&quot; extreme where everybody is a perfectly rational, perfectly
<br>
well-informed individual actor and there are no inefficiencies that
<br>
can be profitably exploited, so nobody even tries to innovate. I'm not
<br>
even sure we've analyzed this hypothetical extreme correctly.
<br>
<p>Also, note that I'm not against corporations. Until we have an eBay of
<br>
labor, resources, and ideas, (aka one big emergent corporation) they
<br>
serve a purpose. I am only against corporate personhood. I am also
<br>
questioning limited shareholder liability, though I don't feel that
<br>
I'm sufficiently informed on shareholder liability to have a strong
<br>
opinion at this time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *HOW* do you expect the average American to be able to make informed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions with regard to that?  Can you make the case that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;uninformed&quot; decision is optimially extropic?
</em><br>
<p>The same emergent collective intelligence that (if the assumptions
<br>
of anarcho-capitalism are correct) allows stockholders to assess the
<br>
prospects of a publicly traded company, and that allows consumers to
<br>
set a fair price for a good sold on the free market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm going to cite one of the Islamic cleric's, I think from the U.K.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who in the light the recent attacks realized that his positions were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unjustifiable.  Blanket criticisms of the U.S. were potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inflamatory and therefore likely to be counterproductive.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same could be said for criticisms of multi-national corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;big&quot; government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State *precisely* what you think is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>The media (in the West) being an oligopoly rather than a free market,
<br>
making it difficult to be informed about world events in an unbiased
<br>
manner.
<br>
<p>The private sector's effective power to censor its critics.
<br>
<p>DMCA
<br>
<p>Government and corporate attempts to curtail free electronic speech,
<br>
free electronic assembly, and freedom from unreasonable electronic
<br>
search and siezure, threatening to do to the internet precisely what
<br>
they have done to the radio spectrum (in the name of copyright
<br>
protection, anti-terrorism, war on drugs, protecting children,
<br>
whatever).
<br>
<p>The very concept of a victimless crime.
<br>
<p>There being more of an incentive to pass new laws than to repeal
<br>
obsolete ones.
<br>
<p>An ongoing assault on second ammendment rights.
<br>
<p>No measurable criteria for evaluating the CIA's and State Department's
<br>
progress toward their supposed goals of making the world safe for
<br>
democracy and free markets.
<br>
<p>The entrenchment of priviledge threatening to get numerous markets
<br>
(e.g. software, labor, music) stuck in local minima.
<br>
<p>The fact that legal protections against being fired for reasons
<br>
unrelated to the quality of your work are weak (except perhaps on the
<br>
basis of race, sex, and religion... and those sure were long in coming
<br>
and not Constitutionally guaranteed-- for chrissakes they had to use
<br>
the INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE to push some of these protections
<br>
through!)... and there will never be legal protections for people who
<br>
feel their boss is paid too much or has a lousy taste in ties.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; State *precisely* what you think might be a solution.
</em><br>
<p>I'm looking for them, like many here are.
<br>
<p>Some possible solutions:
<br>
<p>1. Crypto, anonymity, and anonymous e-cash.
<br>
2. Jury's power of nullification.
<br>
3. In a way the Extropian Fire Drill-- not all triggering conditions
<br>
would necesserily be external ones.
<br>
4. Petitioning to revoke the charters of corporations, and placing the
<br>
burden on them to prove that they contribute to the &quot;public good&quot;
<br>
5. Reexamining the enforceability and usefulness of intellectual
<br>
property laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect there are many more construction workers than molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biologists or military officers in the U.S.A. [This is not intended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as any comment towards construction workers on the list].  Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone here who is in the anti-corporate, anti-government camp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *please* explain to me how having the construction workers vote on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much of their tax dollars get collected or where those tax dollars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get spent (if they get collected and spent at all) is going to result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a greater extropic vector in health care *or* defense than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This, to me, is the fundamental problem with libertarianism is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is an *implicit* assumption that a free market economy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal.  But a free market economy is one that is primarily in ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own self-interest -- and *most* peoples' own &quot;self-interest&quot; (predisposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by genes, warped by social experiences) *DOES NOT* remotely resemble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extropic idea platform.  Lets be realistic -- humans are programmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for survival, sex and fun -- not complexification.
</em><br>
<p>This is a question I don't have the answer to. However, if it takes an
<br>
enlightened caste to guide these construction workers toward a better
<br>
world, things look bleak. Not that we wouldn't make a competent (and
<br>
entertaning) ruling class... but the job is already taken, by
<br>
individuals more ruthless and less visionary than us. Individuals who
<br>
think locally and act globally... construction workers in posession of
<br>
nuclear launch codes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note -- I am not arguing the current system is &quot;optimal&quot;.  I *am*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing that the current system is better than a 1 person = 1 vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system where the average person gets to vote on things they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ill-qualified to evaluate.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know. I look forward to learning a lot in the giant thread
<br>
that's sure to spawn off on this topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In preparation for the criticisms -- yes, scientists could spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more time educating people so they want to support their efforts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there is only so much time in a day and the time one spends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educating individuals uneducated in ones area of expertise is time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cannot be spent exercising that expertise productively.
</em><br>
<p>Hell, scientists barely have time to educate the grad students they're
<br>
tasked with right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe I've stated it before, perhaps in alternate forms, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll state it again.  If you want to vote on it you have to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to demonstrate sufficient knowledge to cast such votes in a considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rational manner.  *THAT* is what extropianism is about.
</em><br>
<p>But then you're faced with the dilemma on whom to put on the
<br>
evaluation committee.
<br>
<p>Actually, peer review might hold the answer. For instance on the
<br>
various slash-sites, you don't get to vote on other people's posts
<br>
unless enough people have voted for *your* posts, and there are
<br>
multiple tiers of membership. Meta-democracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because your atoms happen to be organized in the form of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;human being&quot; doesn't inherently give you extropic voting rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my book (and Anders can come down on me all he wants for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement).  One has to demonstrate that one isn't inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-extropic (e.g. bin Laden) and then further demonstrate an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic behavior history before one gets to cast votes in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic allocation of resources (at least IMO).
</em><br>
<p>Well, in a anarchistic milieau, nothing prevents many Extropians from
<br>
pooling their resources and reallocating them to the most Extropic
<br>
ends, with votes weighted according to expertise and reputation.  Or
<br>
at least, that's what I'd argue if I had a blind faith in anarchy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I will add that there are many people on this list that I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willingly defer to with regard to an extropic allocation of some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the resources I might contribute to the pool.  As I've suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in other threads it all goes back to trust relationships -- who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you trust to allocate your resources responsibly?  Speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly -- I do not have the knowledge of, or interest in, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas to know how to optimally allocate resources for those areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would much rather delegate this responsibility to someone with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expertise who can be trusted to handle the job responsibly.)
</em><br>
<p>Ditto here on not having knowledge to allocate resources extropically.
<br>
A market can be a trust network as well, though. Your level of trust
<br>
for an individual is reflected in discounts or premiums in the price
<br>
you agree on. But whatever would be better-- government by Slashdot,
<br>
government by market forces, government by direct vote on absolutely
<br>
everything...  it cannot evolve without displacing or
<br>
disintermediating our current quasi-democracy. It could evolve in an
<br>
anarchy (then again so could Mafiosi and Warlords, and probably
<br>
faster).
