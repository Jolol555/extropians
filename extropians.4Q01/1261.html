<br>
<em>&gt; The theme of De Soto's book is that even in the west we forgot how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism evolved. Countries try to adopt the end result without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having in place the necessary infrastructure.
</em><br>
<p>OK, Brian. Thank you for that information. Now it makes sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; De Soto went back in history to study the evolution of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic system. He draws parallels between the very same problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced by newly formed free market societies and early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He then attempts to show what is necessary to go from where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are to where they want to be. It is nothing short of revolutionary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I bet this guy wins a Nobel prize.
</em><br>
<p>I think _you_ should get a prize for summing it up so explicitly and clearly.
<br>
(Plus, now I don't need to read the book, so thanks again.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the reasons I don't shop Wal-Mart. De Soto has mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both India and China (I'm 25% into the book) but has already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointed out significant problems with both.
</em><br>
<p>Now I have to take back what I said about not needing to read it.
<br>
Wonder what he predicts about the raging capitalist fervor in coastal China.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;.... and that's Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Everywhere Else?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, and makes a damn good case for it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it took a while to get going in North America too, and Mexico (part of
<br>
the West?) still doesn't seem to have got the knack of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its a great deal more complex than that, you've oversimplified what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he is saying. As he points out bureaucracy makes it almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to own your own home/land/company in many countries much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less use it as an economic asset.
</em><br>
<p>I'll take your word for it, and be glad someone else wants to deal with these
<br>
economic issues. Guess that growing up with private property rights and
<br>
ownership just makes it seem unnatural that other countries don't do things
<br>
the American way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that everyone needs to learn this, but this is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole answer as I believe De Soto correctly points out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without the infrastructure, asset management as we practice it here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the west isn't possible in these countries.
</em><br>
<p>There's that &quot;west&quot; word again. What about Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, etc.?
<br>
They're not part of the West, and they're doing great with capitalism, aren't
<br>
they?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I really think you'd enjoy the book, I'm damn sorry I wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduced to it at Extro-5. (Damn I hated missing that!)
</em><br>
<p>You make it sound worth reading, but I'll bet you could do a book review that
<br>
reads as well or better (and that would save us all some time in the bargain).

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
