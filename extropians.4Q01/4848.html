<p>The term is correct.  However, I do not believe that it applies to non-citizens
<br>
of the U.S.  In contrast, I believe in the French legal system one is guilty
<br>
until proven innocent (someone correct me if this is wrong).
<br>
<p>I would be in the camp outlined by the British Government recently.  If
<br>
people want to enjoy the &quot;privleges&quot; of being a citizen (or even residing
<br>
in) Britain (or the U.S.) then they have to agree to abide by the laws
<br>
of the country.  The laws of these and many other countries prohibit
<br>
conspiracies to commit volent acts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again: even if you would detain every person with a muslim background,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you still wouldn't be safe.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  However, I'll note that FBI said today that the &quot;interviews&quot;
<br>
with ~5000 people are largely complete and did turn up a few leads.
<br>
I'll note that we did not &quot;detain&quot; these people but simply requested
<br>
they make themselves available for questioning.  An imposition yes,
<br>
but I could see some merit in &quot;criminalizing&quot; not making available
<br>
to authorities knowledge related to terrorist activities.  That
<br>
citizens (or foreigners) not make available information that lowers
<br>
the trust or security level of a society can certainly be viewed
<br>
as a violation of the trust environment required for a &quot;civil&quot; society.
<br>
<p>The ~700(?) people who are currently being detained are to the best
<br>
of my knowledge non-citizens, most of whom are U.S. residents in
<br>
violation of their VISA status.  Sorry, but if you have violated
<br>
your &quot;contract&quot; with the U.S. about why you came here or how long
<br>
you intended to stay then I have no problem with letting people
<br>
suffer the consequences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The pilots and helpers of the 9-11 incident have lived and studied legally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Germany for years. One of them was even born in Germany. They didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise any suspicion. They had no problems with the authorities.
</em><br>
<p>True.  Locking up all the people of a specific religious faith makes
<br>
no sense.  Requiring strict background checks on individuals who
<br>
may have access to potential weapons does.  This includes planes,
<br>
truck drivers and even workers in biotechnology laboratories.
<br>
I'll note that the U.S. has arrested dozens of its own citizens
<br>
who turned out to be working at airports in violation of their
<br>
immigration status and requirements for non-felony criminal
<br>
histories.  I personally am outraged that the security agencies
<br>
who provided the security at the airports were so lax in this area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They came legally into the USA (although they must have lied when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling in the immigration form - &quot;are you a member of a terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group&quot;...) and even got their pilot licenses legally.
</em><br>
<p>I believe several entered the U.S. illegally, perhaps from Canada
<br>
and several were in violation of their immigration status (having
<br>
overstayed their VISAs) at the time of their attacks.  This points
<br>
out the need for greater information tracking.  If you enter the
<br>
U.S. to get an education, it should be verified that you are doing
<br>
that and when you leave that should be verified as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What kind of &quot;police work&quot; could find them without making the whole country 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a police state?
</em><br>
<p>The kind that has been done over the last several months.  The
<br>
kind that would involve greater coordination between various
<br>
departments of within a government and between various governments.
<br>
The kind that would strengthen the knowledge that embassies might
<br>
have regarding the identity and travels of people applying for VISA.
<br>
<p>I think a major hole that needs to be plugged is the problem of
<br>
forged identity documents.  Right now I'd say that is one of the
<br>
weakest links.
<br>
<p>Trial Balloon: What would be the downside to the requirement that
<br>
all individuals applying for a VISA must also provide information
<br>
related to the standard DNA polymorphisms used to confirm identity?
<br>
<p>(I'm not sure this would have prevented the 911 attacks, but it would
<br>
have raised red flags if the individuals applying for VISAs were
<br>
known to have visited Pakistan or Afghanistan as well.)
