<p>No, because I already was aware of both those points. So my feelings haven't changed
<br>
either way. I haven't felt &quot;safe&quot; since I first understood the consequences of
<br>
nanotech presented in Engines of Creation. Welcome to the club, Kai. You're
<br>
smart. Now a whole lot of us need to get wise: a much more challenging proposition.
<br>
<p>How I feel is nowhere near as important as what I do.
