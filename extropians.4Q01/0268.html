<em>&gt; Without standards, nothing is a &quot;crime&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Right, and since we are never without standards, we need never be in doubt as
<br>
to what constitutes crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suicide isn't an act of bravery as any psychiatrist can tell you.
</em><br>
<p>They should know. Psychiatrists have the highest suicide rate of any group.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As anyone who has taken philosophy 101 knows there is no such thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as objective, man is the measure.
</em><br>
<p>So then this is a subjective statement and only has relevance in relation to
<br>
how one measures it; and outside the realm of philosophy, science has high
<br>
regard for objectivity which is accessible via mechanical measurement
<br>
independent of human intervention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These chickenshit cowards thought they were earning eternal rewards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an afterlife and the title of heroes in this one. They were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narcissistic greedy little bastards, along with being cowards.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, you got that right. Their theism gave them the strength to perpetrate
<br>
their crimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The brave and courageous were the men aboard flight 93 and I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have their memory tarnished by refering to their killers as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything other than the scum of the earth they were.
</em><br>
<p>The men who foiled the theistic hijackers were indeed heroes, and despite Tina
<br>
Turner's popular lyrics, we do need more heroes.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
