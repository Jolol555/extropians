There seems to be two different ways of using word-associations, be they
<br>
puns, stems or cabalistic similarity. In one approach you look at words
<br>
with some link and claim this implies a metaphysical or other
<br>
relationship between the concepts they represent. In the other you
<br>
select word associations to demonstrate or suggest a relationship. The
<br>
first approach is clearly wrong, since words are not reality. The second
<br>
approach is often easy for us due to our highly associative nature, so
<br>
easy that it seems to imply that there is an underlying metaphysical
<br>
truth because meaninful relations seem to pop up with alarming
<br>
regularity, while really just due to our association skills.
<br>
<p>A typical example is how cabala claims words with the same numerical
<br>
value are linked. In some cases this produces very meaningful
<br>
associations, but at least in English god = dog which is a relationship
<br>
most cabalistically inclined people shy away from (usually by stating
<br>
that it only works in *true* languages, although I have no doubt you can
<br>
find plenty of similar relations in Hebrew or Enochian) rather than
<br>
accept as an insight in that a dog has the YHVH-nature. 
<br>
<p>Is it always pernicious use the second approach? I think it doesn't have
<br>
to be, but one has to be careful. If you clearly recognize that you have
<br>
selected a associations for their poetic or emotional resonance and
<br>
state this in the text, then it seems pretty benign. It may not be a
<br>
proof of anything, but it can be a way of making real - especially messy
<br>
or diffuse - relationships between concepts shine more clearly.
