<p>Sure, mine was a very simplified analysis.  Let us look at
<br>
this from another perspective.  Consider &quot;good relations with
<br>
the west&quot; as a resource.  Israel has used this to great advantage
<br>
to both itself and the west.  Saudi Arabia has so benefited as well,
<br>
granted to a lesser extent.  Destroying good relations, especially
<br>
with those neighbors who have a lot of money and power, is not
<br>
in the best interest of any nation, analogous to torching one's
<br>
own oil fields.
<br>
<p>So let the Middle Eastern nations do as the Jews have done,
<br>
send some of their brightest and best to Europe, to America,
<br>
to Asia.  Let them work their way up thru the governments
<br>
and businesses in those places, then send wealth and brains
<br>
back to the home country.
<br>
<p>Of course, many or most of the expatriates will become assimilated.
<br>
I have a vision of the Christian, the Arab and the Jew sitting
<br>
in the park together and commiserating that their grandsons
<br>
are far more interested in mastering the subtleties of nintendo
<br>
than the bible, the koran or the torah.  May it be so.  spike
