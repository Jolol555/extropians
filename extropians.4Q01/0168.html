<p>You bet your bippy I did.  But after Bryan's heads up,
<br>
I reduced my credence level.  Specifically, after a
<br>
bit of thought, it seemed highly unlikely to me that
<br>
such a study could be conceived of or instigated by
<br>
anyone WITHOUT a religious inclination, interest, or
<br>
agenda.
<br>
<p>Certainly you don't think Dr. Cha and the staff at the
<br>
Cha hospital are all atheist or agnostics. ;-) 
<br>
<p>Also, I never really thought of the Rev Moon as a
<br>
religious man, more like a cult leader.

<p>I don't want to cheap shot these guys, they all seem
<br>
ultra-educated and as emlyn would say, they all have
<br>
nice lab coats, so they must be legit.  Whoops!
<br>
<p>One of the reasons I'm not ready to jump on the
<br>
bandwagon (despite a bit of motivation to do so) that
<br>
dismisses Penrose's theories of a quantum effect in
<br>
the microtubles, or in consciousness, or in biological
<br>
phenomenon generally, is because BIOLOGY IS EVOLVED,
<br>
and that evolution takes place in the presence of and
<br>
subject to the effect of the complete inventory of
<br>
physical phenomena.  If it is *physically* possible
<br>
for quantum phenonomena to enhance
<br>
survival/reproductive fitness, then they MUST BE
<br>
selected for, integrated into biological systems, and
<br>
otherwise subject to the evolutionary dynamic, our
<br>
ignorance of the details of quantum phenomena
<br>
notwithstanding.  Psi and quantum phenomena, whatever
<br>
the extent of their reality, are mysterious only
<br>
because they are not yet understood.  See Ray Charles,
<br>
below.
