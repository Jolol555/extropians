Interesting:
<br>
<p>I very briefly reviewed a book some years ago that made the following claim:
<br>
<p>Forever Young: Science and the Search for Immortality By Jim Schnabel,
<br>
Bloomsbury, 229pp 
<br>
<p>&lt; Still, is there a deep plan for the course of human life, one that dooms
<br>
us inevitably to death? Brilliant and cool, as funny in his sardonic way as
<br>
P. J. O'Rourke, journalist Jim Schnabel roamed America in his baby blue
<br>
Cadillac in search of scientific answers to mortality. His choice of
<br>
laboratories and experts is inspired, his tale sublimely apt at the
<br>
millennium's turn. Is Alzheimer's disease, for instance, a curable kind of
<br>
arthritic inflammation? Yes, says Schnabel, and the drugs to stop it are in
<br>
clinical trials right now, perhaps on sale by 2004. &gt;

<p>Hints of an Alzheimer's Aid in Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
<br>
<p>By GINA KOLATA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Middle-age and elderly people who took anti-inflammatory drugs like
<br>
ibuprofen or naproxen for at least two years were apparently protected from
<br>
Alzheimer's disease, according to a new study by scientists in the
<br>
Netherlands. Their likelihood of getting Alzheimer's dementia was one-
<br>
sixth that of people who did not take the drugs.
<br>
<p>The study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, offers
<br>
hope for preventing Alzheimer's but falls short of being definitive,
<br>
experts said. They cautioned that the findings did not mean that people
<br>
should dose themselves with anti- inflammatories, which can have serious
<br>
side effects, to prevent Alzheimer's.
<br>
<p>The researchers, led by Dr. Bruno H. C. Stricker of the Erasmus Medical
<br>
Center in Rotterdam, invited every person 55 or older in a suburb of
<br>
Rotterdam, Ommoord, to participate in their study. Of 10,275 who were
<br>
asked, 6,989 agreed and were eligible. None had Alzheimer's. But by the end
<br>
of the study, 293 had developed it.
<br>
<p>Some participants took anti-inflammatories and some did not, by their own
<br>
choice and not the researchers' design. Most who took the drugs used them
<br>
for arthritis.
<br>
<p>In the group that took no anti- inflammatory drugs, 210 out of 2,553
<br>
developed dementia. But 3 out of 233 who had taken the drugs for at least
<br>
two years developed it. The dose did not appear to be important, the
<br>
researchers found. 
<br>
<p>The effect was specific for Alzheimer's. The drugs did not help other
<br>
diseases like ministrokes, which can cause memory loss and confusion. 
<br>
<p>The sole drugs that seemed to affect the risk of Alzheimer's were
<br>
anti-inflammatories. Aspirin, unlike other anti-inflammatory drugs, did not
<br>
appear to have a protective effect, possibly, the researchers said, because
<br>
participants were taking very low doses.
<br>
<p>Dr. John Breitner, an Alzheimer's disease researcher at the Johns Hopkins
<br>
Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the new study was impressive.
<br>
Unlike many others, it followed healthy people for a long time, an average
<br>
of 6.8 years, to see who came down with Alzheimer's disease. The
<br>
investigators also had impeccable records of the patients' use of medicines.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a fantastic study, and they showed a very powerful effect,&quot; said Dr.
<br>
Breitner, who is directing a study of anti-inflammatory drugs in people at
<br>
risk of becoming ill with Alzheimer's.
<br>
<p>A potential flaw in the Dutch study is that the scientists did not randomly
<br>
assign people to take active drugs or dummy pills for comparison purposes.
<br>
For that reason, they cannot be certain it was the drugs and not some other
<br>
characteristic of the patients that made the difference. 
<br>
<p>Because the drugs have side effects like serious, sometimes fatal, stomach
<br>
bleeding, medical experts advise healthy people to await the results of
<br>
randomized trials now under way before taking anti-inflammatory drugs other
<br>
than aspirin in the hope of preventing Alzheimer's. 
<br>
<p>A strength of the study is that the researchers had highly reliable
<br>
information about what drugs the participants took, because for most of the
<br>
study period nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs were available in the
<br>
Netherlands only by prescription, and the Dutch keep excellent records on
<br>
the use of prescription drugs. 
<br>
<p>By contrast, in earlier studies, researchers had no good way of knowing
<br>
what drugs people had taken. Some studies with patients suggested that
<br>
anti-inflammatories prevented Alzheimer's, whereas others did not. 
<br>
<p>Studies in the laboratory and in animals had also suggested that anti-
<br>
inflammatory drugs prevented Alzheimer's disease or delayed its onset. 
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's disease experts say that clinical trials that may confirm or
<br>
refute the Dutch study will be completed soon. 
<br>
<p>In one study supported by the National Institute on Aging, people who
<br>
already have Alzheimer's disease are taking either dummy pills or
<br>
anti-inflammatory drugs to see whether the drugs can slow the progression
<br>
of the disease. The researchers will have an answer by the middle of 2002,
<br>
said Dr. Neil Buckholtz, chief of the Dementias of Aging branch at the
<br>
institute. 
<br>
<p>Another study, also supported by the institute, involves healthy people 70
<br>
or older with family histories of Alzheimer's. Those subjects, too, are
<br>
taking anti-inflammatories or dummy pills. That study will take at least
<br>
five more years, Dr. Buckholtz said.
<br>
<p>For now, said Dr. Steven DeKosky, who directs the Alzheimer's Disease
<br>
Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, the Dutch study is
<br>
encouraging. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This is solid circumstantial evidence,&quot; Dr. DeKosky said. &quot;It is probably
<br>
the strongest evidence so far that anti-inflammatory drugs can quiet things
<br>
down perhaps enough to delay the onset of the disorder.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now it's up to the clinical trials to show us whether or not they are an
<br>
effective prevention or an effective treatment strategy.&quot;
