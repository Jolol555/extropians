<br>
<p>PNAS (USA) 98(4):1416-1421 (13 Feb 2001)
<br>
Uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 are highly active H+ transporters and
<br>
highly nucleotide sensitive when activated by coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) 
<br>
Echtay, K. S. et al.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/4/1416">http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/4/1416</a>
<br>
<p>Points out that Coenzyme Q (Q10) is essential for the function
<br>
of the uncoupling proteins in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.
<br>
Q10 is known to be a factor required for electron transport to
<br>
produce the hydrogen ion gradient essential for ATP production.
<br>
This study now shows it is essential to uncouple the H+ ion
<br>
gradient as well.
<br>
<p>The &quot;uncoupling&quot; is an essential part of heat production by
<br>
adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in warm blooded animals.
<br>
(One is &quot;burning&quot; glucose to produce the H+ ion gradient
<br>
and then uncoupling it (allowing the gradient to run
<br>
back downhill) the net result of this wasteful process
<br>
is heat).
<br>
<p>So if you don't have enough CoQ10 (which can happen if you
<br>
lean towards vegetarian diets or are on certain cholesterol
<br>
lowering medications) then you may not be able to produce
<br>
enough ATP (feeling lethargic) or may not be able to burn
<br>
off the excess hydrogen ion gradient (feeling cold).
<br>
<p>Now *interestingly* enough mitochondria from UCP3 knockout
<br>
mice seem to produce higher than normal levels of free
<br>
radicals (probably due to a complicated process where the
<br>
electron transport chain gets backed up).  That would lead
<br>
one to suspect that low Q10 levels (disrupting UCP function)
<br>
could also lead to higher production of free radicals
<br>
(probably accelerating aging).
<br>
<p>A lack of CoQ10 and therefore a lack of uncoupling might also
<br>
contribute to obesity.  This is because if you don't waste some
<br>
of the H+ ion gradient through the uncoupling proteins it is going to
<br>
get turned into ATP (through ATP synthase) and the excess ATP
<br>
will in turn get stored as fat...  So when people are fat and
<br>
have high cholesterol and their physicians prescribe cholesterol
<br>
lowering drugs (that also lower CoQ10 synthesis) their ability to
<br>
uncouple the mitochondria decreases and they can't burn off the fat.
<br>
Catch-22.
<br>
<p>These results also suggest that differences in the structure,
<br>
levels or regulation of UCP or UCP-like proteins or the regulation
<br>
of CoQ10 synthesis between short lived and long lived mammals or
<br>
birds might yield some interesting insights into whether or not
<br>
they play a role in the longevity of long-lived species due to
<br>
their essential role in the function of relief valves for high H+
<br>
gradients across the mitochondrial membrane that contribute to
<br>
free radical production.
