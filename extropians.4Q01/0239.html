YET ANOTHER forwarded message with no commentary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or is he saying: &quot;Just as we hoped. Bush is following the script we wrote.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course we knew the Americans would take the bait! That was our whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design! Soon there will be open war between the infidels and Islam&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The enemy has done the unexpected. Our own government has done only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected. There is no doubt who is winning, or who holds the upper hand.
</em><br>
<p>In my opinion this is baloney.  What the U.S. government has done has
<br>
been completely unexpected.  I'll bet not one person in 100 would have
<br>
predicted on September 12 that there would have been NO U.S. military
<br>
reprisals three weeks later.
<br>
<p>Virtually everyone, and I'll bet bin Laden as well, expected the U.S. to
<br>
come in with bombs and start blowing Afghanistan to bits.  Instead,
<br>
the government has IMO played the game very carefully and very smart.
<br>
They are doing everything they can to AVOID falling into bin Laden's
<br>
plans.
<br>
<p>His whole point was to turn this into a war between Islam and the West.
<br>
This has been his stated goal over many years, described in interviews
<br>
and articles.  He wants to provoke an over-reaction by the West which
<br>
will awaken the Islamic world and unite them in violent opposition to
<br>
Western culture and governments.
<br>
<p>Instead the U.S. has gone to enormous pains to distinguish between Islam
<br>
and the terrorists.  Every day, the President or his spokesman say good
<br>
things about Islam and praise the Islamic states which are allying with
<br>
them.  Many of those nations are just as afraid of terrorism as we are.
<br>
<p>Who would have thought three weeks ago that Pakistan of all countries
<br>
would be one of our most important alliance partners in this effort?
<br>
I doubt very much that bin Laden planned for that!  Even the Sudan has
<br>
made encouraging noises, and Iran is supporting the Northern Alliance
<br>
against the Taliban.  The U.S. has been very successful in exposing the
<br>
division within the Islamic world between the violent extremists like
<br>
bin Laden and the far more numerous moderates who see him as a threat.
<br>
This is a direct and intentional counter to bin Laden's strategic plan.
<br>
<p>Granted, the game is not played out yet.  Great care must be exercised
<br>
in the use of force.  But there are legitimate military targets among
<br>
the Taliban, and sooner or later bin Laden and his lieutenants will
<br>
be exposed.
<br>
<p>It is pretty clear that the U.S. is not going to go in and try to bomb
<br>
Kabul back to the stone age.  Anyone who has seen the &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot;
<br>
broadcasts on CNN knows that Kabul is already in the stone age, physically
<br>
as well as culturally.  I've never seen a more ruined city.  For once
<br>
the U.S. seems to realize that bouncing the rubble would be pointless.
<br>
<p>In summary I think this was a very poor analysis, substituting
<br>
preconceptions for the facts about what has actually happened over the
<br>
past few weeks.  Rather than falling into bin Laden's trap it looks
<br>
to me like the U.S. is directly and strategically countering his plan.
<br>
The U.S. strategy may or may not succeed, but the article seemed blind
<br>
to all of these issues.
<br>
