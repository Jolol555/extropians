First of all: I am sure that you're right about the USA, and I think I am 
<br>
right about Germany. But my real question is still unanswered - and I 
<br>
think the answer _is_ important for this list: Even if the USA can only 
<br>
lower their highest crime rate in the western world when all their citizens 
<br>
have guns (and I doubt this, because &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;), why 
<br>
do the other countries have a rate four times lower _without_ this? There 
<br>
must be other factors than guns, and for me, these are the important 
<br>
factors.

<em>&gt; I have examined this data in the past. I notice that this study examines

</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not accurately impunge legal gun ownership, since most all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large cities in the US greatly restrict gun use by law abiding citizens.
</em><br>
<p>The study provides data for cities _and_ the countries as a whole. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note also that the study only has data for West Germany up to 1992, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germany as a whole. East Germany's inclusion from 1992 onward results in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a boost in crime rates of around 20%, and given that East Germany has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had far more restrictive gun laws than West Germany, this confirms my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own assertions.
</em><br>
<p>East and West Germany joined 1990. The overall crime rate, including(!) 
<br>
&quot;vereinigungsbedingte Kriminalität&quot; (crimes in context of the rejoin) is 
<br>
not higher than in the eighties.

<br>
1999  82,037,000      6,302,316     13,02
<br>
<p>The data in <a href="http://www.bka.de/pks/pks1999/index2.html">http://www.bka.de/pks/pks1999/index2.html</a> shows, that the risk 
<br>
of homicide in Germany today is still well in the range of comparable 
<br>
western states, and thus well below the USA. The 20% peak in 1993 gives a 
<br>
rate of 5.24/100,000, which is only half the rate of the USA in this year. 
<br>
The weapon laws here are even more strict than before 1990.
<br>
<p>And these are numbers for a country with an overall population density like 
<br>
New York or Chicago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, firearms, as technological instruments of individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empowerment, are extropic.
</em><br>
<p>Firearms empower to what? To kill. I can't find this extropian. Like the 
<br>
proverb says: For some one with only a hammer, everything looks like a 
<br>
nail. Someone who has a gun has no need to think about better alternatives. 
<br>
Cf. the discussion about no-alternatives situations...
<br>
<p>The Rennaissance, by the way, was followed by the 30-year war, which left 
<br>
Europe devastated, with 6 mio. dead (30% of the population) and the economy 
<br>
and social structures destroyed.
