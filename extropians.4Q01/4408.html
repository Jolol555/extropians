If you have not read the complete transcript of the now infamous videotape
<br>
of Osama Bin Laden's discussion of the events of 9-11, you should.  It was
<br>
published in its entirety in today's Dallas News, and I am sure that it is
<br>
available at dallasnews.com as well as many other news websites.
<br>
<p>As one who has lived and travelled in that Middle Eastern region (three
<br>
times to Saudi Arabia), I know how people think, how their thoughts jump
<br>
from one idea to another in a different way than, for example, an American
<br>
way of thinking and talking.  Thus, this videotape seems quite authentic to
<br>
me, and I have no doubt of its validity.  Two things surprise me: (1) that
<br>
the conversation was even recorded on videotape in the first place (which
<br>
indicates a certain &quot;vanity&quot; on the part of someone who was present at this
<br>
discussion); and (2) that there were so many praises to Allah during the
<br>
course/flow of the conversation (but I suppose that if you are such
<br>
fanatics, then that would be &quot;de rigueur&quot;, so to speak).
<br>
<p>All of the talk about dreams and premonitions is most intriguing, I think.
<br>
At one point in the tape, Bin Laden remarks: &quot;We were at a camp of one of
<br>
the brother's guards in Kandahar.  This brother belonged to the majority of
<br>
the group.  He came close and told me that he saw, in a dream, a tall
<br>
building in America, and in the same dream he saw Mukhtar teaching them how
<br>
to play karate.  At that point, I was worried that maybe the secret would
<br>
be revealed if everyone starts seeing it in their dream.  So I closed the
<br>
subject.  I told him if he sees another dream, not to tell anybody, because
<br>
people will be upset with him.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fascinating!
<br>
<p>Flashback to early August.  Six ultra-fundamentalist Pentecostal
<br>
missionaries, including two young Texas women from Baylor University, got
<br>
arrested in Kabul on charges of proselytizing Christianity.  None of them
<br>
should have been there in the first place, the idiots, but that is beside
<br>
the point.  They vehemently denied the charges, and during the September
<br>
events, their trial was underway.  The Taliban accused them of distributing
<br>
Bibles and engaging in other illegal Christian activities in Afghanistan.
<br>
They denied all the charges, but I myself suspected that they were lying.
<br>
At the time I was really wondering what the Taliban would end up doing to
<br>
these people.  But it never happened, and they were freed and eventually
<br>
came home.  The two Texas women met Bush at the White House and have given
<br>
media interviews since then.
<br>
<p>Guess what?  Now they are bragging about how they were secretly trying to
<br>
convert these Moslems to Christianity by telling them the story of Jesus
<br>
and giving them copies of the Bible and other literature.  So they lied,
<br>
not only to the Taliban but to the press.  They did not have the courage to
<br>
stand up and be counted as &quot;Christian soldiers&quot; who were ordered by St.
<br>
Paul to &quot;go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature&quot;.
<br>
These hypocritical Pentecostals &quot;denied Him thrice&quot;, as St. Peter did.
<br>
<p>Conclusion : I predict that when these would-be Texas missionary
<br>
Pentecostal women stand before the Dreadful Throne of Judgment, confronting
<br>
their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they will be banished to Hell along
<br>
with Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaida.  Christian cowardice is certainly as
<br>
great a sin in the eyes of &quot;Jesus&quot; as Islamic terrorism, n'est-ce pas?
<br>
<p>Sweet Dreams.  Roberto
