<em>&gt; However, leaving aside the oil debate for a minute, I'll simply point

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the energy to the Earth from the moon do not appear to me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;recommended&quot; solutions.  Why?  Because you are messing up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecological balance of the planet.  We know we could potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have on a habitable planet with the CO2 levels in the atmosphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several centuries ago (at least on multi-100-thousand year timescales).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We *don't* know if we have a planet which is habitable for the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term with the current CO2 atmospheric levels *or* in a situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the Earth is receiving (and having to *radiate*) significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more energy than it currently absorbs from the sun [which is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens if you collect the energy on the moon and beam it to Earth].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So *unless* your energy plans include sprinkling white styrofoam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beads over much of the ocean's surface area or building cooling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towers into the stratosphere, I think you should consider that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fossil fuel based energy supply and off-planet harvested energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are really *bad* ideas. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I do support seeding the oceans with iron and potassium to aid
<br>
in plankton growth to help compensate for the damage caused by ozone
<br>
depletion. I have seen some models that show that most of the increase
<br>
in atmospheric CO2 (and the temperature rise of the past 30 years) can
<br>
be explained almost entirely by the decrease in oceanic plankton
<br>
populations caused by ozone hole related UV radiation. Of course, once
<br>
the ozone hole goes away as CFC levels drop back to normal, the need for
<br>
this should end.
<br>
<p>My cousin's work that I've occasionally talked about here is supposed to
<br>
be published some time early 2002, the conclusions of which imply that
<br>
the earth can withstand a global temp increase of a minimum of 6-9
<br>
degrees C without any impact on the Antarctic Ice Cap, and that the
<br>
claims of the cataclysmists are wrong, so all we really need to worry
<br>
about is the Greenland Ice Cap.
<br>
<p>Supporting evidence for this conclusion I found my freind George Ashton,
<br>
former director of the US Army CoE Cold Regions Research Laboratory,
<br>
says that the papers he's been reviewing show that the evidence the
<br>
cataclysmists base their claims on, which is that ice flow rates on the
<br>
smaller Antarctic Ice Sheet (as well as Greenland) have increased, has
<br>
left out the fact that this speedup is due to the warming period that
<br>
followed the Little Ice Age, because the speed at which atmospheric temp
<br>
changes are transmitted through several miles of ice is rather slow,
<br>
such that the warming that lubricates the current speedup occured
<br>
hundreds of years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And before you start suggesting &quot;engineered&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions (yea, I know you guys like to do this, just like me)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you better ask yourselves *how* good your computer models are and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the limits are on climate predictability due to chaos effects?
</em><br>
<p>I guess it depends on where the equilibrium states are, eh? Those on the
<br>
cataclysmic side claim that every incident of odd weather is due to the
<br>
chaotic 'thrashing' effect of a climate changing from one equilibrium
<br>
state to another. If our previous state is an equilibrium state, then
<br>
taking measures to return us to that state should act as negative
<br>
feedback, leading to greater stability.
<br>
<p>The fact is that so long as Antarctica is separate from other
<br>
continents, such that the Circum-polar ocean current remains in force,
<br>
then the Antarctic Ice sheets will remain thermally isolated from the
<br>
rest of the world. This fact alone negates the claims of cataclysmists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know some would say that in &quot;bad&quot; situations that economic conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would change (e.g. if global warming gets really serious, we put a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big tax on fossil fuels).  But you run the risk of what happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if there are catastrophic triggers?  If global warming is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to trigger the methane hydrates on the ocean floors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaporize things could get very bad very quickly -- much quicker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than economic adjustments could fix things.
</em><br>
<p>But what evidence is there that this would happen? Hydrates are trapped
<br>
not because of temperature, but because of pressure. Increasing pressure
<br>
from melting glaciers raising ocean levels only makes hydrates more
<br>
secure, not less. You would need to significantly lower ocean levels in
<br>
order to trigger a hydrate release, something that only occurs during
<br>
ice ages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its the catastrophic risks where our knowledge base is really poor, e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gamma ray bursts, asteroid impacts, methane hydrate stability, ocean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current stability, etc.  that you need to take into account when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about these situations before you promote various ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember -- we *are* on the Titanic its just a question of whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not it sinks before we have the technology to plug the various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holes in the hull and can prevent further icebergs from hitting us.
</em><br>
<p>The fact is that the simulations that cataclysmists use ALWAYS
<br>
overestimate the amount of warming that should have already occured in
<br>
the past century by several degrees, they refuse to acknowledge the
<br>
ozone hole link to natural carbon sequestration, as well as other
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>You are right to be concerned about adding more energy by beaming it
<br>
from the moon or from orbital platforms, as that does increase the
<br>
insolation rate, but there are means to compensate for this, which the
<br>
cataclysmists vehemently oppose not because of vague and unspecified
<br>
dangers, but because allowing oceanic plankton seeding would allow us to
<br>
greatly expand our energy usage via microwave beaming, which directly
<br>
conflicts with their luddite political agendas.
