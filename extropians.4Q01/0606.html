<p>&lt;&lt; &gt; Not unrelated, last night we dropped 37,000 meals (and no
<br>
<em> &gt; medicines) or putting it in perspective, assuming all of those meals
</em><br>
<em> &gt; are delivered to people who need them, we provided meals for one day
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to 1/2% of the people who desperately need them. If we use all of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; aircraft committed to date, and all of the flight crews, exclusively
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to deliver food during daylight hours, we will be able to feed at most
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 3% of the starving population of Afghanistan - which will probably
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mean that in February the Hajj will open to the news of 6 million plus
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dead Afghans. And it will be portrayed and believed to be largely the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; fault of the US. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Another analysis works less on utter catastrophe to American Policy, then a 
<br>
more focused Al Qeidda meta- goal: The capture of Saudi Arabia and the rest 
<br>
of the Gulf States.  Bin Ladin is a royal son of a royal house (so to speak) 
<br>
and his family is the chief business organization that involves all major 
<br>
construction in the Gulf. The Bin Ladins have lived in the Boston area, and 
<br>
have donated heavilly to Harvard University. They have returned to Saudi 
<br>
Arabia on September 19th, 2001 because of safety concerns. 
<br>
<p>So who is Bin Ladin playing to? The answer is the &quot;street&quot; as the term is 
<br>
used in the Islamic world. I do not see how the US can placate the Street, 
<br>
which is enamored with what I call political Islam (Government by 
<br>
anti-Americanism and Sharia), and deliver, what is desired. The US cannot 
<br>
force a nuclear-armed Israel, to vacate Israel, for example; for what 
<br>
nation-state would cave into such a demand, whatever the outcome? As Gen. 
<br>
Sharon stated a few days ago &quot;we are not Czechoslovakia..&quot;
<br>
Al Qeidda is however interested in severing Saudi ties to the United States, 
<br>
and thus bring the US  &quot;to its knees&quot; so to speak, via with-holding 
<br>
petroleum!  This may be their primary goal, at least for now.
<br>
<p>If one sees this as a primary goal of Bin Ladin's, then Robert J. Bradbury's 
<br>
up-comming paper on Biomass production of fuels, should be the meta-goal of 
<br>
this group. Lastly, I am not so pessimistic on what the results will be from 
<br>
our retaliation can achieve, especially if we do not get bogged-down in 
<br>
satisfying coalition demands (especially the Saudi govt) in refraining from 
<br>
destroying our enemy, as we did in Desert Storm.
