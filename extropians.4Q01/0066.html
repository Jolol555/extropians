<p>I found it just okay for a popular level article.  I usually don't like
<br>
_Scientific American_.  Case in point with this one.  They dismiss
<br>
counterarguments much too skimpily, IMHO.
<br>
<p>I kind of brought it up to shift focus away from the terror attacks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While it may be true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we currently live in the &quot;habitable zone&quot; it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a good case as to why it is impossible that an advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological civilization could not have evolved a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred million to a billion years earlier than us somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closer to the galactic center (where the metalicity is higher).
</em><br>
<p>That's always possible.  Plus, we don't know the parameters for life in
<br>
general.  Perhaps complex life of our sort might not be able to survive
<br>
under radically different conditions, but who knows about what the range of
<br>
complex life is?
<br>
<p>If we had some defensible minimum time to evolve intelligent life, perhaps
<br>
we could better settle this, but that would seem to involve actually getting
<br>
many samples of such.  So far, we only have one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Articles like this always cite the radiation hazard, but any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiation level below that which vaporizes the oceans of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a planet is somewhat suspect IMO.  We know from Deinococcus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiodurans that it is perfectly feasible to evolve life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms that have *much* more robust radiation tolerance than that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average species on this planet has.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it is a bacteria.  Bacteria overall are much hardier than most more
<br>
complex organisms.  This doesn't utterly refute your point, but what applies
<br>
to bacteria shouldn't be extrapolated to higher life to readily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A reasonable argument can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also be made that higher radiation levels and/or cometary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impacts would actually accelerate evolution.  Yes, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get to the point where you keep reducing life to dust faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it can complexify but we have no good feel for whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are in the middle of the galactic hazard function or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either end of the distrubtion.
</em><br>
<p>You might be right here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, it contains no discussion of what happens if technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations evolve to our stage and beyond (through the singularity).
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think you have to have the conditions for evolving such life first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Fermi Paradox rests on the assumption that travel and/or colonization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by life forms like us is a worthwhile persuit.  I'd argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations capable of interstellar travel are going to be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more interested in &quot;harvesting&quot; brown dwarfs or dense molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gas clouds than planets like Earth.  But we have been over all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this ground before so it probably isn't worth the bandwidth.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not.  I suspect it might be a matter of how much time such
<br>
civilizations need to go from the kind of communication technology we could
<br>
detect -- and thereby we'd be able to find out about them -- to stealthing
<br>
for whatever reason -- even unintentionally.  My belief is, if everything
<br>
goes right, this might be a matter of decades.  (Imagine a counterfactual
<br>
history of Earth, where humans come up with all the neat tech, but avoid
<br>
wars and such that represent setbacks.  Imagine also that most humans are
<br>
dedicated to technological progress and don't put any irrational roadblocks
<br>
in its path.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
