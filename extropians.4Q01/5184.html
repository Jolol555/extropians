re:

'2) They can restrict the people they take'
<br>
what if none will take you, or the only one to take you is undesirable?

Subject: One Unity, Different Ideologies, all in the same universe
<br>
<p><p>: Previously &quot;One humanity, all in the same boat&quot;
<br>
:
<br>
: A short note: We should refrain from saying &quot;one humanity&quot; because that
<br>
: would exclude alien species. I use unity in this case to
<br>
: mean all sentient beings.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: I would like to ask readers here to consider a world separated more on
<br>
: ideological divisions rather than mere race, geographical
<br>
: location and skin color (or other equally superfluous different). In this
<br>
: world, different communities abound where each community
<br>
: offers a unique ideology where one can subscribe to.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: One can choose to join any of these communities freely, and can start a
<br>
new
<br>
: one if neccessary. This provides free competition (in
<br>
: the uniquely productive rather than redundant sense). The communities will
<br>
: follow a non-interventionist policy what some basic
<br>
: important rules:
<br>
:
<br>
: 1) Communities cannot detain people who wish to leave
<br>
: 2) They can restrict the people they take
<br>
: 3) Those who choose to stay or enter without permission will subject
<br>
: themselves to the internal rules of the community (such as
<br>
: punishment)
<br>
: 4) Communities cannot interfere in the affairs of the other communities
<br>
who
<br>
: signed this treaty
<br>
:
<br>
: Given this, no dictator can rule his or her own people without having
<br>
: concern about them because these people can always choose to
<br>
: go to another community. Meanwhile, it does not deprive others of the
<br>
choice
<br>
: to join, say, this dictatorship because of certain
<br>
: (perceived) advantages that we might not consider rational (such as for
<br>
: religious reasons).
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: Such a world would provide vastly more choice for all people than say, one
<br>
: dominated by socialist sentient AI (I mean this in a
<br>
: positive way!) or a world dominated by an anacho-capitalist society. We
<br>
: should not assume that people will have the same goals as us
<br>
: (such as the pursuit of self-interest) or even that they have no goals at
<br>
: all, but to provide them with choices such that they can
<br>
: choose their own path.
<br>
:
<br>
: This could stop a lot of conflicts from happening because if people can
<br>
live
<br>
: the way they disire, then presumely they would not need
<br>
: to fight for their &quot;cause&quot; whether we consider these rational or not. The
<br>
: exception, of course, lies with those whose ideologies
<br>
: require them to enslave or at least &quot;take over the world&quot;. This could
<br>
cause
<br>
: some problems until a system exists to keep them in
<br>
: check (or wait until most people venture space leaving these people with a
<br>
: sparsely populated planet Earth).
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: I suggest considering this approach of &quot;many ideologies, many societies&quot;
<br>
: over alternative approaches that champion any one of the
<br>
: proposed social systems. No shoe can fit everyone and we should learn that
<br>
: the easy, rather than the hard way.
<br>
:
<br>
: We should also have a wider prespective rather than the egocentric &quot;my
<br>
: people&quot;, &quot;my country&quot;, &quot;my planet&quot;  and even &quot;my species&quot;
<br>
: thinking. This kind of attachment causes a lot of unneccessary problems
<br>
when
<br>
: they conflict with others thinking along similiar
<br>
: lines.
<br>
:
<br>
: Perhaps the first lesson any advanced sentient being can teach us, on
<br>
first
<br>
: contact, would consist of knowledge on how to live with
<br>
: ourselves. Technology will not serve us well if we only bothered to use it
<br>
: to build bombs to blast each other.
