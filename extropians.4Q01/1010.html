<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; From where I sit the US is quite interested in a war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's ridiculous, there is no reason America would want any war right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; now, much less a &quot;major and  indefinite&quot; one. Do you think Americans just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; woke up one fine day and thought &quot; You know what I'd really like, I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rule the poorest country in the world, Afghanistan&quot;? It's not complicated, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; need to look for hidden motives, we are at war because somebody is trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to kill us and they've already made a very good start.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then tell me exactly why we are talking about an indeterminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; war against an unknown number of targets in an unknown number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; countries.  Such a war should be shouted down immediately.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it isn't.  Why?  As bad as 911 was such a response is overboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and overly broad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Too bad. The problem is not in our response, it is in their behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They refuse to act according to the laws of war, which were set up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow civilian populations to remain as free and unfettered as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the inhumanities of war. Fascists all through the 20th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked hard to erode those laws as much as possible, and the current day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists are doing the same. They don't wear uniforms, declare no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allegiance to any nation or official army, attack unarmed civilians, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not use recognised military weapons.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  Tell me, have we ever acted outside the laws of war? 
<br>
Have we ever disrupted governments using terrorist tactics (at
<br>
least tactics that would be labelled so if done by anyone but
<br>
us)?  
<br>
<p>You push a people into a corner, then you push some more and
<br>
sooner or later they strike back in any way they can.  Then you
<br>
claim that they are bad sports and breaking the rules and
<br>
deserve whatever you do.  
<br>
<p>But even this was not the question.  The question is why are we
<br>
calmly talking about taking on an indeterminate war with
<br>
unclear, except in the abstract, objectives?  By now I thought
<br>
we knew better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the worst possible behavior, because it is an attack on the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust foundations of our society. We cannot go blindly on insisting they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are still there when they have crumpled as assuredly as the towers in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New York did. Therefore, to insist upon behavior that depends on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parties acting in a trust worthy manner is pollyannish behavior of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most excessive sort. It is tantamount to a Titanic passenger demanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; room service when everyone else is in the lifeboats and jumping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overboard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is hypocrisy.  We have done some damn dirty deeds outside
<br>
the rules also.  We have not acted in a trustworthy manner and
<br>
it is not getting better, it is getting worse.  To not note it
<br>
is the height of pollyannish behavior. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt;Are you utterly sure some elements of your own  country are not planting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt;just enough anthrax to create a scare and justify going after the next target?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Right, and flying saucer crashed in New Mexico 50 years ago and there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; bodies of aliens in a freezer at a Air Force base, and we learned how to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; microprocessors from the debris of that crash, and JFK is still alive, Elvis too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and CIA satellites are beaming thoughts into my head, and black helicopters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are chasing me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Laugh if you want to but it is a much more complicated world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than blase assumptions that we are the good guys and those are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the &quot;evil ones&quot; would lead you to believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Typically people who claim that the world is this complicated are those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who need to make excuses about why they continue to do nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, let us by all means &quot;do something&quot; even if we do not bother
<br>
to take stock of where we are and how we got there and thus most
<br>
likely make things much worse.  Bah!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We do not know there is any terrorism plot behind the anthrax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scare according to experts.  Nor do we have evidence saying it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is done by any particular group that is more than extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flimsy.  That the Taliban are nasty folks does not say they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsible for all ills nor that an endless campaign that goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; substantially beyond Afghanistan is in the least justified.  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to mention the eviscerating of our own civil liberties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it is bin Laden's MO that he doesn't claim responsibility for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts outside of releasing videotapes a few days or weeks before hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about how his enemies will suffer the consequences. Since nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else is stepping up to the plate, that is a pretty good indicator. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three locations where letters have been tracked to: Boca Raton, Newark,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Malaysia, have known populations of islamic radicals.
</em><br>
<p>That is not even circumstantial evidence!  The above is
<br>
laughable.  What are you calling &quot;Islamic radicals&quot;?  According
<br>
to some sources people who you might fit that label to exist
<br>
almost everywhere.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's fairly simple, Samantha, so try to follow along: Terrorists don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow the laws of war. The Laws of War help protect the foundations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our high trust society. Therefore we pound to dust anyone who practices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism.
</em><br>
<p>We are ourselves terrorists.  Will we take a turn?  Please be
<br>
honest.
