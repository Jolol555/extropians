</em><br>
<p>Ten years ago I was in a Plowshares engineering group.
<br>
We were looking at ways of using the newly-idle cold-war
<br>
era military equipment for other purposes, since we could
<br>
buy the stuff at firesale prices in 1991, right at the end of
<br>
Papa Bush's administration.  One of the most tempting
<br>
items was the submarine launched missiles, no longer
<br>
needed for carrying nukes.  (Our group name was
<br>
borrowed from the bible: &quot;...they shall beat their swords
<br>
to plowshares...&quot;)
<br>
<p>With most of the sophisticated and ruinously expensive
<br>
guidance removed we could buy them for 10 million US
<br>
clams.  The missiles have three solid motor stages, the final
<br>
motor being a cylindrical device that goes up thru the center
<br>
of the equipment section.  We calculated that if we removed
<br>
all the military gear, we could give a wealthy thrillseeker
<br>
a few orbits, assuming she was not too heavy, i.e. less than
<br>
about 75 kg.  We called it the Bill Gates Express, or BGE.
<br>
<p>Balance of the toroidal shaped payload section was
<br>
problematic, however, for we worried that if the astronaut
<br>
decided to move to another position for whatever reason,
<br>
or even wet his pants or lost significant mass sweating or
<br>
barfing, for instance, the CG of the final stage would go
<br>
slightly off centerline.
<br>
<p>Without the sophisticated guidance, the final stage could turn
<br>
pi radians in a lazy arc, get pointed fiery end first, spraying
<br>
all the solid fuel products of combustion (iron and aluminum
<br>
slag and various other crud) directly into orbit.  This would
<br>
spread in a deadly cloud, perhaps damaging or destroying
<br>
most or all low-orbitting assets.
<br>
<p>We decided we would not risk being named as the
<br>
dozen rocket scientists who ended the space age.  spike
