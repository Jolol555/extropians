Disappointingly few details here about a planned manned moon landing:

<p>China plans moon landing

CNN Hong Kong 
<br>
<p>BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China is planning to send a man to the moon as
<br>
part of its developing space program. 
<br>
<p>China has yet to send a manned craft into space but plans to do so by
<br>
2005, the state-run China Daily newspaper reported on Friday. 
<br>
<p>The mission is part of Beijing’s plans to create a space industry and
<br>
earn the prestige of joining the United States and Russia as the only
<br>
nations to have sent humans into space. 
<br>
<p>China first launched a satellite in 1970. In 1999 and January 2001 it
<br>
successfully launched the &quot;Shenzou&quot; unmanned spacecraft. 
<br>
<p>A monkey, a dog, a rabbit and snails were sent into orbit aboard the
<br>
second Shenzou launch but scientists say that more unmanned tests will
<br>
be necessary. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We must be sure that the astronauts are 100 percent safe in outer space
<br>
after launching,&quot; said Liang Sili of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
<br>
in the newspaper report. 
<br>
<p>Space blueprint
<br>
The China Daily reported that Beijing plans to launch three further satellites
<br>
for weather monitoring, oceanic study and earth resource exploration
<br>
in 2002 as part of a five-year &quot;white paper&quot; space program blueprint.
<br>
<p><p>Sun Laiyan, vice director of the China National Space Administration,
<br>
declined to give any details of the moon exploration plan other than
<br>
that it was part of China's space industry plans. 
<br>
<p>&quot;China has put the plan for developing the industry on the table,&quot; the
<br>
China Daily quoted Sun as saying. 
<br>
<p>China has already launched several satellites for U.S. and Brazilian
<br>
operators and is vying for a greater share of the satellite launching
<br>
market. 
<br>
<p>To date, it has launched almost 50 satellites with a 90 percent success
<br>
rate. The launch of 30 more are planned in the next five years, the state-run
<br>
Xinhua news agency has reported. 
<br>
<p>Cooperation
<br>
China's space program will involve further cooperation with Russia and
<br>
the European Union, Sun said. 
<br>
<p>In collaboration with the European Space Agency Part, China will launch
<br>
moon probes from Long March carrier rockets, the official Xinhua news
<br>
agency said. 
<br>
<p>China has been looking towards aerospace technology as a way of making
<br>
advances in other fields including agriculture, medicine, meteorological
<br>
studies and telecommunications. 
<br>
<p>&quot;For mankind in the 21st century, space applications will become as essential
<br>
as electricity and oil in the 19th century,&quot; Liang told the China Daily.
<br>
<p><p>However, China was also wary of the increasing use of space for military
<br>
applications. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I should point out that some powers in the world are on the way to militarizing
<br>
outer space, not peacefully exploring outer resources,&quot; Huang Huikang,
<br>
an official from China's foreign ministry, told the China Daily. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Another arms race in outer space has begun since 1998 and we should
<br>
be watchful,&quot; Huang said.
