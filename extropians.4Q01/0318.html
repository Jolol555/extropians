</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, here is a first point : how can you predict them without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding them ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can predict that many hate the US for some of its past and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future actions (not especially for our goodness as some would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like to believe).  I can predict more of them will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increasingly desperate and horrific action as we press this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;war&quot; more deeply on their homelands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But can you predict how they will react if US leave Saoudi Arabia, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example ? Think of the talk here about not depending on oil anymore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much of a solution will that be ? What about Israel ? Will US have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to abandon Israel, too, to satisfy their sense of justice ? And if US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave Saoudi, and Israel becomes New Israel somewhere in Utah (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone suggested <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/kinsella5.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/kinsella5.html</a> ),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will they be happy, then ? Or will they go on to a further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishment of justice, by attacking us ?
</em><br>
<p>So, even if we have done horrendous things ourselves in the Mid
<br>
East
<br>
and elsewhere in the world we should still act as if those who
<br>
strike against us are simply subhuman &quot;cowards&quot; and have no
<br>
qualms about
<br>
ripping the hell out of any country we think is supportive of
<br>
them? Or should our own complicity give us a moment or two of
<br>
pause? 
<br>
<p>Should we ok all matter of covert actions to assasinate, wage
<br>
psywar, topple governments, kick in doors in foreign lands in
<br>
the middle of the night and execute all within, bomb hell out of
<br>
strongholds even with heavy &quot;collateral damage&quot; in pursuing this
<br>
policy against the all black-hearted &quot;enemy&quot;?  If we practice
<br>
all of these techniques as our administration and the Pentagon
<br>
have called for with little limits then exactly how are we
<br>
better than those who use some of the same techniques to strike
<br>
us for what they believe are our wrongs?
<br>
<p><p>After reading some of the Israeli rhetoric and looking into its
<br>
actions I am increasingly of the mind that Israel does not
<br>
deserve our protection.  At the very least it does not deserve
<br>
to be treated with kid gloves by us for its many abuses.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how you can predict these things without understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what their claims are, what they feel deep inside, and what they want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am attempting to understand their claims.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are 2 things to consider for the prediction : what they want,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what they can actually achieve. Now, and in the future. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously, how many of them, how well organized, how well supported,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will be, and this amounts to understanding the links between them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and between more general cultural-social-religious perceptions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well.  I can predict that if we take some of the actions
<br>
proposed against Mid East targets you will have a lot more of
<br>
the area much more strongly polarized against us.  Their
<br>
powerlessness is a fertile ground for terrorist strikes as those
<br>
take a lot less resources and are by their nature launched in a
<br>
clandestine manner.  It would take a full police state to
<br>
control against all manner of terrorism.  Do we want to go there
<br>
at home or abroad?  I don't think so.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That misses my points.  But I do not believe Islam is itself as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; central as oppression, injustice and victims lashing out against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who they see as the oppressor any way that they can.  Islam, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather the more militant edge of it, is relevant but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe it is the most central for understanding the story.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is easier for many to do amateur &quot;analysis&quot; of Islam and blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Islam than come to grips
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with guilt and culpability on our as well as &quot;their&quot; side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, I see the following problem : you are so willing to be fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and moral, and to face your own (collective) responsability, that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that everything depends on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I certainly did not say any such thing.  But I think it quite
<br>
important to speak up when I see our own collective
<br>
responsibility being ignored or not considered in the equation. 
<br>
I think it important especially when we are proposing actions
<br>
and policies that will increase the danger and volatility hugely
<br>
with imo insufficient consideration of how we may be ordering
<br>
much more of the same that inflamed and fueled terrorist actions
<br>
from the region in the first place.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's like tomorrow is Judgement Day, and nothing else matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In the possible consequences of our actions we could be headed
<br>
straight into a huge war that could inflame much of our planet
<br>
for at least a generation.  That is as close to &quot;Jugement Day&quot;
<br>
as I want to get.  I hope we consider fully where we are, how we
<br>
got here and the possible consequences at such a time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But if you see what's in their head, then you will probably see that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not everything they require match what you are willing to give. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that you are ashamed that the US did, they mock as tame and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coward. That things that you would like to see establish for justice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they reject totally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not necessary to see fully in our heads to realize that if
<br>
I myself with my own philosophical settings was a native of that
<br>
region I would not have a very good attitude to many of the
<br>
actions of the US and of our allies (especially Israel).  
<br>
Putting oneself in their shoes does not mean you have to take on
<br>
all of their beliefs.  Even without that I cannot say they did
<br>
not have cause to be militant toward us in whatever way they
<br>
could.  
<br>
<p>That some reject what I might consider more just does not mean
<br>
that all do or that implementing a bit more just behavior in the
<br>
region would not take some of the energy out of their terrorist
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But talking about &quot;justice&quot;... what is it ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I won't even go there.  We are claiming &quot;justice&quot; on our side to
<br>
do whatever we wish in the region.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Isn't justice the respect of the rights of an individual belonging to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a community, the rights being given by the rule of the community ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think rights are given by communities.  But that is a
<br>
different conversation. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So what's the community we are part of with bin Laden ? Did we agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on anything together ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can talk about justice when we agree on something. Trying to agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will bring out what both parties want, and we will see if it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compatible. If so, we will commit to something, and respect it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is another way of making other human beings not humans
<br>
because they are not us and we don't have formal agreements. 
<br>
Actually there are agreements that are supposed to be for all
<br>
peoples in the world although we as well as they often ignore
<br>
them.  I think we do owe a certain level of reasonable behavior
<br>
to all people whenever possible. I do not agree that that 911
<br>
means that we can/should act utterly without any consideration
<br>
of what is reasonable behavior or sub-humanize all who might
<br>
employ terror tactics against us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the mean time, focusing on the fact that &quot;we must respect justice&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to solve the problem doesn't strike me as a terrifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is precisely what we are claiming to act from.  It is a
<br>
hypocritical claim if it is not what we act from.  
<br>
<p>Are you saying that it does not matter at all whether we caused
<br>
a large part  of the problem with our actions and policies?  Do
<br>
you sweep any truth to such responsibility under the rug by
<br>
saying it is a justice claim and that &quot;justice&quot; is not
<br>
applicable?  This seems to me a very questionable stance.  It is
<br>
a claim about reality.  A claim of cause and effect and a
<br>
recognition that one cannot expect to elimiate much of the
<br>
unwanted effects without recognizing and modifying what causes
<br>
that one can.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ben Laden is not mad, not evil, not coward (I don't know him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; personnally, but at least it doesn't appear to be). But he is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ENNEMY (read his &quot;Declaration of war against the Americans&quot; in case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you have any doubt). Do you need to morally diminish your ennemy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; acknowledge him as such ? Of course not !
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Will we make him and others like him less an enemy by bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the hell out of large sections of the Mid East that we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; already been screwing with in often horrendous ways for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decades?  Very doubtful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if you kill your ennemy, he does stop to be your ennemy in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And a dozen rise up in his place.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Will it help our reaching Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to engage in such hypocritical posturings as &quot;Infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Justice&quot;.  Hell no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that the names have a &quot;tactic&quot; meaning, and are not directed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the public but to the ennemy himself. But as it is publicized, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaves much to be desired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.  It sure does leave a lot to be desired.  It is a sickening
<br>
parody. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You may object that this way of thinking tends to polarize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; situation, by accepting that &quot;good&quot; guys can be our ennemies, and be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fullfilling prophecy avoiding that we build a harmonious world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; together, with all the good guys, by explaining them that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong to act as they do, and that by just adapting a little their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour, we can consider them as really good guy and not &quot;very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; evil-mad&quot; good guy. But that which you may overlook, is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't give a damn of your &quot;harmony&quot; and your &quot;sense of justice&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is just degenerated christian-atheist nonsense. For them, justice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't disagree at all and see some point in being clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certainly. But I still think whether we judge the terrorist as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cowards or courageous is a side-show to the main questions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; issues.  We are hypocrites to hate these terrorist when our CIA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has done much worse in many countries, toppled and created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entire regimes, engaged in torture, terrorizing civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; populations and so on.  Any &quot;solution&quot; that does not admit our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; own dirty deeds and work toward stopping our own real terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a very dangerous cover-up and scapegoating.  Was what was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; done to the WTC and Pentagon wrong?  Of course.  But was it also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a seriously aggreivated wrong from our own past actions?   I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think the answer again has to be affirmative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this way of thinking shows you want to be fair, and to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally good conduct. This is of course something good. However, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said above, there is a danger in thinking that everything depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you do, and on its position on your moral scale. There happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be other people, with specific world views and agenda, very remote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from yours.
</em><br>
<p>Everything does depend on what we do and how we do it as far as
<br>
the degree of relative safety and room for our dreams to become
<br>
real.  Or at the least, that is the only handle for influencing
<br>
things that we have.  It is not whether I or we look moral or
<br>
not per se.  It is about something that much more root level
<br>
than that.  It is about whether we are acting in congruence with
<br>
reality and with fundamental principles based in reality or
<br>
not.  If we are not then we can expect that our actions are not
<br>
likely to do other than making things much worse.  Let other
<br>
people take care of their own worldview and acting with
<br>
integrity.  We are responsible for our own.
