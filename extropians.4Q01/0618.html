From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Nothing%20beats%20science%20(was:%20This%20war%20is%20not%20about%20terror...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;0a4801c150dc$8ae86dc0$ab5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is a serious oversimplification. If I saw a brain with activity in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those regions, I would say &quot;this is a strongly emotional brain state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely pleasurable and fairly complex&quot; - but I am pretty sure there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many other mental states like that that would produce the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activation pattern. Functional neuroimaging is still struggling to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become more than neophrenology. If a brain area is activated, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely tells you that this functionality is involved, not which function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that functionality is active. If I could stimulate the above areas, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would most likely get something far different from love (most likely a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of nausea experience with tremor) - what is required is stimulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain neural networks embedded within these regions, which we at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present cannot distinguish from the other networks dealing with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions and actions.
</em><br>
<p>The point made was that these things are measurable, not that they are simple
<br>
and easy to measure. Just as measuring the speed of light may require more
<br>
than the tools one finds in the kitchen, so measuring specific emotions
<br>
scientifically requires more than we presently find in the MIT lab.
<br>
In order to accurately assign specific emotive labels to areas of the brain,
<br>
it's necessary to correlate measurements of activity in those areas (or groups
<br>
of areas, including the enteric nervous system) to known emotional content of
<br>
an observed subject.
<br>
As mentioned in the article
<br>
<a href="http://www4.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/11/08/love.in.lights.ap/index.html">http://www4.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/11/08/love.in.lights.ap/index.html</a>
<br>
the emotions accompanying love have been identified in the anterior cingulate
<br>
cortex, the middle cortex, middle insula, putamen, and caudate nucleus. What
<br>
we need to know is the exact proportion that each area is active and
<br>
participating in the function, as well as the manner in which each area
<br>
interacts with the others. Measuring the combination of these actions, as well
<br>
as their interaction with the enteric nervous system offers a big challenge to
<br>
neuroscience, but certainly no bigger than the challenge of &quot;uploading&quot; which
<br>
has occupied huge chunks extropian list resources.
<br>
Since the cited article is rather dated, more recent data might exist which
<br>
could help scientists to more accurately measure such phenomena as emotional
<br>
content and aesthetic appreciation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Correlation is not equivalence: even if I with a high probability can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess the right emotion from the activation pattern, that does not mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pattern *is* or corresponds to the emotion. It could simply be due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a more subtle change somewhere else, causing both the emotion and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern.
</em><br>
<p>To be sure we're measuring the correct emotion, we'd need to verify this by
<br>
asking subjects if they did in fact experience the intended emotion when
<br>
certain brain structures are stimulated or activated. Another aspect of this
<br>
kind of investigation involves noting the results of psychotropic substances
<br>
on emotional response and how this corresponds to brain activity at the
<br>
molecular level. Using this technique in reverse, that is, measuring brain
<br>
hormone levels which accompany specific emotional content may yield
<br>
collaborative data to check the validity of brain scans or neural sensing
<br>
instruments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an emotion-interested neuroscientist I think we will one day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand emotions scientifically: how do they work, why do we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, how will they be affected by different interventions and maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how this ties in with the phenomenology of emotion. But today we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are far from being able to say things like &quot;happiness is serotonin&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I see no reason to doubt that neuroscientists (such as you someday ©¿©¬ ),
<br>
will soon discover the cognitive mechanics that underlie human emotion.
<br>
Serotonin is, of course, only one of many hormones that both affect levels and
<br>
types of brain activity, and are in turn quantitatively affected by sensory
<br>
input and interaction with the external environment. Acetylcholine, Adrenaline
<br>
(epinephrine), dimethyltryptamine, Dopamine, Endorphins, Norepinephrine,
<br>
Oxytocin, Phenylethylamine, and  Substance P, just to name a few of the
<br>
chemicals which interplay in brain activity, also add to the complexity of
<br>
producing a workable schematic of the human brain.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Science was &quot;invented&quot; roughly 400 years ago. But we have had largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same intelligence for several hundred thousand years before that. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would disagree that intelligence impels science - science-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking is part of intelligence, but turning it into an effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system of thought is something else.
</em><br>
<p>Well if you don't agree that intelligence impels science, no doubt you'll
<br>
agree that it is _not_ stupidity that impels science. &lt;grin&gt; It doesn't really
<br>
matter to me whether anyone prefers to think of science as a subset of
<br>
intelligence or the other way around. When I wrote that intelligence impels
<br>
science, I simply meant that reason and logic are the driving forces as well
<br>
as essential tools that allow us to acquire real knowledge.
<br>
Intelligence, in the sense that I use the word, simply means the ability to
<br>
solve problems and answer questions. With the help of science, our
<br>
intelligence can be more practically focused than without science. It has been
<br>
suggested that our intelligence is not the same as it was 400 years ago.
<br>
Review the Flynn Effect for details.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an empiricist and Popper fan, I would say: Nothing beats science yet.
</em><br>
<p>As an objective observer and extropy fan, I would say: Science will measure
<br>
the degree that anything beats it, and if so, will happily applaud the
<br>
improvement.
