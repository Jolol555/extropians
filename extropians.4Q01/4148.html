<em>&gt; I'm not so sure about that.  I think that in the past ten years, the genre
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;Electronica&quot; has branched out from being essentially one style of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music, to being literally hundreds of variations on a style such as we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today (Ambient, Drum N' Bass, Progressive Electronica, House, Jungle, Goa,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Techno etc.).  I would argue that this is a direct by-product of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more tools available to express one's creative leanings.  Newer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies in music (as in all fields) lead to more options, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately more creativity.
</em><br>
<p><p>A majority of the new genre creation is entirely unnecessary.  Most people
<br>
are unable to tell you what the difference is between half the genres.  And
<br>
of all these dozens of genres, only a couple are fundamentally new at the
<br>
composition level.  Many genres don't define much other than a particular
<br>
sound used to make it e.g. trance is almost entirely defined by the use of
<br>
the &quot;hoover&quot; sound (for the semi-layman, detuned PWM oscillators in unison
<br>
mode typically used with an inverted pitch envelope -- originally found as a
<br>
preset on the old Roland Alpha Juno).
<br>
<p>I would say that the most unique thing to come out of the '90s that hadn't
<br>
been done before in music, was proper Drum 'n' Bass (e.g. LTJ Bukem and
<br>
Talvin Singh).  Most of the other &quot;new&quot; genres were barely distinguishable
<br>
deviations of existing stuff, such that the differences probably fall below
<br>
the noise floor of normal differences between given artists in the same
<br>
genre.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In my opinion, the biggest area that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; musical technology has and will continue to affect is in the production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end, as opposed to the writing and performance end.  Being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digitally smooth out and process any aspect of an analog-initiated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance is a very valuable tool nowadays.  Just try to find any decent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producer or engineer who hasn't used Pro Tools yet.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree that the technology is getting ridiculously good and only getting
<br>
better.  However, Pro Tools is primarily of useful for editing live
<br>
recordings in the studio.  For productions that are fundamentally
<br>
electronic, Logic Audio rules the roost.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't foresee analog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guitars and basses being phased out anytime soon, but the analog drum kit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will soon be a goner, I fear.  Most musicians (at least, the ones who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not drummers...) only want a steady beat to play to.  The labor of finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a drummer (let alone a good one) and hauling around the multitude of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment the average drummer has is rather redundant, when you can get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digital equipment that is almost always the equal of an analog (i.e. flesh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and blood) drummer.
</em><br>
<p><p>That's a good observation.  I have a library of over 10,000 drum samples
<br>
that I use and an increasing number of very good percussion synthesizers
<br>
(including physical models for most parts of a drum kit).  Most of the sound
<br>
and performance aspects of a drummer are available to me if I want to add
<br>
those as well.  So a drummer is replaceable in the studio at least.
<br>
<p>In truth though, I simply love the sound of sample-accurate timing (which is
<br>
accurate to within 10-20 microseconds on most hardware).  I *had* been using
<br>
a MIDI sampler, which is only accurate to within maybe 3-5 milliseconds and
<br>
has a bit of random variation in the timing.  I didn't think it would be a
<br>
big deal, but the difference between going from a MIDI sampler to a
<br>
sample-accurate Logic Audio soft sampler (the EXS24) was like night and day.
<br>
Sample accurate drum tracks sound *tight*.  Highly recommended.
<br>
<p>Question for the drummers:  Why does sloppy drummer timing sound &quot;organic&quot;
<br>
and sloppy MIDI timing sound &quot;sloppy&quot;?  I don't hear a difference, but I've
<br>
seen it justified this way many times.  Drummers that actually have
<br>
excellent timing (i.e. sub-millisecond) are extremely rare, so perhaps it is
<br>
a way of justifying abilities that are less than excellent.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Not to be overly obvious, but I also think that the digification of analog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instruments will increase steadily for the next number of years.  Look to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see more and more of those old Mellotrons, Hammond and Farfisa organs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moogs, Prophets, Jupiters and VCS3s become MIDIfied and used in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercial recordings.
</em><br>
<p><p>The digital models of the old analog monsters are becoming VERY good.  A
<br>
couple existing models are indistinguishable from the real thing (e.g. the
<br>
OASYS has a Prophet-5 DSP model that is shockingly perfect, though the DSP
<br>
model was designed by the same guy that made the original Prophet-5).  We
<br>
are only a few years from getting to the point where everything can be
<br>
cheaply modeled in DSP.  We are pretty much at that point now for analog
<br>
synthesizers.  
<br>
<p>The holy grail of physical modeling, the piano, has almost dropped into the
<br>
range of commercially viable DSP requirements (Moore's Law marches on).
<br>
I've heard from knowledgeable people (at Korg R&amp;D) that the piano models
<br>
sound indistinguishable from the real thing, but the fact that it originally
<br>
required multiple high-end DSPs for each note when it was first created
<br>
meant that you would have to have a DSP mainframe to have a usable
<br>
instrument.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As for me, I'm just happy with my Korgs!
</em><br>
<p><p>Me too.  (Wavestation A/D, Z1, and OASYS)
<br>
<p>Cheers,
