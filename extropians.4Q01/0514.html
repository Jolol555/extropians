<p><em>    &gt; There was no proof that the plant was manufacturing nerve gas
</em><br>
<p>War is not an American courtroom I don't need proof beyond a reasonable doubt,
<br>
more probable than not is good enough for me. Considering the murderous
<br>
warlords who run Sudan it seems more probable than not to me that they're more
<br>
interested in biological weapons and nerve gas than drugs to heal the sick or plastic
<br>
for children's toys.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; We launched missles against the territory and facilities of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; countries we were not at war with.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody formally declares war anymore, it's as out of style as hoop skirts
<br>
but if Afghanistan wants to go against the tide and declare war on the USA
<br>
that's fine by me. Oh wait, I'm wrong,  they've already done that with their
<br>
Jihad. Are you suggesting we just roll over and play dead?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;We ultimately  did it because we could get away with it
</em><br>
<p>A keen grasp of the obvious. The good thing is we can and well get away
<br>
with even more.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; In short we were major international bullies
</em><br>
<p>More of the blame the victim crap. Would you also say the Jews were major
<br>
international bullies in the early 1940's when they persecuted the poor peace
<br>
loving Nazi's? Most things in life are shades of gray but not this time. On side
<br>
represents civilization and construction, the other side represents barbarism and
<br>
destruction. One side denies some women the very top jobs in corporations the
<br>
other side beats all women unmercifully with canes for daring to show a naked elbow
<br>
in public. One side thinks it's a scared duty to fly two civilian airliners into the two largest
<br>
civilian office buildings in the world at the very time of maximum occupancy, and one
<br>
side does not. The two sides are not comparable Samantha, Chomsky is on the
<br>
wrong side and it sounds like you are too.
