<em>&gt; Gosh, that must have made the victims feel so much better :-P
</em><br>
<p>I think &quot;Gosh&quot; is a euphemism for &quot;God&quot; isn't it? Actually, what made the
<br>
victims feel better was their belief that they would go to their mythical
<br>
heaven after death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Religion models certain non-theistic belief sets, including Communism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain extreme environmentalist sects, very nicely.  Similarities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include rejection of factual evidence, belief in some goal which is higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than human well-being, factionalism, and intolerance of dissent.
</em><br>
<p>That's for sure. True believers exhibit identical symptoms of irrationalism
<br>
regardless of the flavor of their belief system. One might also include
<br>
atheists in this category if their belief in the non-existence of God reaches
<br>
the adamant stage. For this reason, I like to call myself a &quot;non-theist&quot;
<br>
rather than an atheist. It's not that I believe there is no God, it's that I
<br>
reject belief itself. I'm a non-believer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The misdeeds of communists and suggestions of certain environmentalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (AIDS as a good thing, etc.) support my opinion that the problem is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious *style* of epistemology and ethics, not the specific beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The specific beliefs may be more or less harmful; it's the approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that turns bad beliefs into atrocities.
</em><br>
<p>Eric Hoffer has referred to the religious style as the &quot;true believer&quot; mode.
<br>
True believers exhibit certain kinds of behavior that demonstrate a need for
<br>
certainty and purpose in their lives. They want everyone to enjoy the benefits
<br>
of their belief system, and they work hard to convince the whole world of
<br>
their particular view. If other people don't believe as they do, they perceive
<br>
this as a threat, because it means that there may be some doubt that their
<br>
belief is true. That's why objective and dispassionate observers don't trust
<br>
zealots who work too hard to prove that they are right. After all, if
<br>
something's true, why get yourself in a tizzy about it. It will be true no
<br>
matter who believes or disbelieves it.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
