<em>&gt; &gt; The fear is that through cloning/GE, there will be an artificial

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Population will be over-run by &quot;designer humans&quot;, potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those who have genetics that are not naturally possible via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reproduction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I share that fear considering what will happen if the current
<br>
general society determines in detail what kind of human beings
<br>
it wants for the next generation.  Overall, given reasonably
<br>
democratic free-choice this will result in the proliferation of
<br>
a number of traits many today would consider desirable and the
<br>
suppression of a number of others, including some arguably part
<br>
of high intelligence and creativity.   
<br>
<p>In short, we are in a sort of Catch-22.  We can't seem to get
<br>
too much better without getting smarter and more capable and we
<br>
can't get smarter and more capable without using certain
<br>
technologies with more wisdom than we generally possess.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) the assumption that things will get worse if humans are allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take responsibility for them. This is largely based on the ease we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with bad scenarios and examples of mistreatments in the past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while leaving out all the good things. One reason is of course that good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news are not very exciting, so they do not get trumpeted about as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or written about in history books. But there is also an assumption here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that mankind is always fallen, and increased freedom always must result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in increased evil actions rather than increased evil and good actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't assume things would get worse.  I simply assume, based
<br>
on a lot of observation, that some pretty screw things will be
<br>
done with any powerful new technology, not just or even
<br>
necessarily predominantly good things.  There is reason for some
<br>
caution and safeguards. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 3) The assumption that the best way of handling this potential risk is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to abstain from a technology that could be bad in a repressive society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than seek to deal with the repressive society. If we are worried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about sexism, maybe we should see what we can do about sexism in our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society. If we are worried about cloning being used to create carbon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy people, maybe the right way to handle it is to strengthen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not so much worried about a repressive society as about not
<br>
especially wise or more or less rational or ethical human beings
<br>
and human organizations wielding powers increasingly able to
<br>
really screw us up in perhaps a terminal degree. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Another (somewhat unrelated) scary thought experiment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People fear cloning/GE used to produce &quot;designer humans&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are better than organic/natural humans.  Has anyone discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the fear of using cloning/GE as a weapon?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do not worry about super-soldiers.  I do worry about people
<br>
become obsolete and no consideration given to their well-being. 
<br>
Whether they are made obsolete by genetic design of superior new
<br>
humans or by AI or robotics or something else is immaterial to
<br>
the basic concern.
