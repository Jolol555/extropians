</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Selbourne was entirely useless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It was nothing more than a rundown of a position based on opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unsubstantiated by facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Islam, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddism, etc. are faiths based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the &quot;blind&quot; belief of one reality over another.  Since they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are cannot be subjected to scientific debate, they are useless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from an extropian perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is that a blind belief?  Scientific validation is not the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to come to what one considers valid ...
</em><br>
<p>There is, of course, subjective validation (as in anecdotal evidence), but
<br>
scientific validation is consistenly the &quot;best&quot; evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... and crucially important.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly subjective validation may be crucially important (yet that won't
<br>
make a particular belief more &quot;true,&quot; but rather more &quot;preferred&quot; by
<br>
someone).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many spiritual systems do not require blind faith but consist of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a series of exercises and practices possibly leading to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validation of a way of being in the world that is seen as of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great value.  Some of these sorts of practices exist within all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the major religions and outside of them as well.  But I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure you are aware of this also.  So why speak as if religion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just about &quot;blind belief&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Even stone sober 20/20 belief is not as good as science, because science is
<br>
BEYOND belief.  And that, IMHO, makes science a more serious pursuit for
<br>
those interested in critical thinking, rationality, and succinctness.  (The
<br>
habit of scientific critical thinking may be an acquired taste for some, but
<br>
once acquired ...yummmmmm.)
