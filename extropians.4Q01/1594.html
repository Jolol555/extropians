<p>So it's a little too soon to assume that the music industry as we know
<br>
it is a corpse.
<br>
<p>### This is correct but I would imagine that for the entertainment industry
<br>
to be able to use the tactics that currently allow them to charge 16$ for a
<br>
music CD, the government would have to intervene very heavily on their
<br>
behalf. This might involve outlawing the use and ownership of personal
<br>
general-purpose computers, and forcing the installation of hardware which
<br>
would make them into the so-called &quot;trusted devices&quot;, incapable of
<br>
playing-back of copyrighted content.
<br>

<br>
<p>This blithely assumes that the only negative consequences will be on the
<br>
people everyone loves to hate, the marketers and publishers.  Somehow the
<br>
negative impact on the artists is overlooked here.  It would not suit
<br>
the political purpose of this essay to dwell on reduced revenues to
<br>
the creative people who make music and other content.
<br>
<p>### Artists would on average make less money. Tough. More worrisome would be
<br>
the reduced incentive to publish handbooks and other scientific and
<br>
technical works which need constant updating and maintenance. 
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>Why the adjective &quot;public&quot; in public radio?  Is there something about
<br>
public radio which makes it a public good while private radio is not?
<br>
Not that I can see.  Both are non-excludable and non-rival, within a
<br>
certain area.  Why then would the author have mentioned public radio
<br>
while failing to describe ordinary radio and television as public
<br>
goods?  Again I think it is because it wants to lure us into accepting
<br>
a certain model of how to think of this problem.
<br>
<p>### Public radio (or at least most of the public stations) is supported by
<br>
direct donations from listeners. They are public because the public is
<br>
paying for them and thus controlling the content but not through taxes (at
<br>
least not in my area). Ordinary radio and TV are advertising media using
<br>
some non-commercial content to attract viewers. They are *private*
<br>
nonexcludable, nonrival goods, distributed to the public but not controlled
<br>
by the public.
<br>
<p><pre>

<p>Here we see how smart he was not to mention existing forms of IP.
Someone who listens to public radio without contributing is at worst
a leech.  Compare it to someone who steals patented technology, or who
fraudulently uses someone else's trademark, or republishes a copyrighted
novel without a license.  Most people will think of these activities
much less favorably than the guy who doesn't pay PBS.
<p>### Actually, these are attitudes which developed only since the idea of IP
was conceived and implemented - if you were to ask the ancient Romans if it
is permissible to copy a (specific copy of a) codex, with it's owner's (but
not author's)consent, they would might have been surprised by the question.
Attitudes to property do change and are very malleable.
<p>I am curious to hear what will be the solution proposed by the author. I
would agree with you that the governement should not provide content, except
in certain specialized fields directly relevant to the protection of human
life - basic research, risk analysis information. It looks like the
solutions proposed by the publishing industry will need a dramatic expansion
of the government's ability to monitor its citizens.
