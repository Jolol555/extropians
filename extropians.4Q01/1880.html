<p><em>    &gt;I recognize that it  hurts like bloody hell to take note of where your notions about

</em><br>
<p>Of course it doesn't hurt at all, in fact many on this list myself included take delight
<br>
in lambasting government in general and the USA government in particular.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I get bored and fed up with the  &quot;all religion is bad and your enemy&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, its not our fault if she has a short attention span, some people get
<br>
bored in calculus class too but that doesn't make what is said any less true.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;or echoes of &quot;we are all  light and 'they' are all dark&quot; memes.
</em><br>
<p>I have no embarrassment in saying crashing civilian airliners into skyscrapers
<br>
is dark and trying to prevent such things is light, no embarrassment at all.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I recognize that it is very difficult when angry and worried about the present
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;and future especially to see sides of a situation that one would prefer not to see.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly why people get so angry with her, the insistence that there is a good
<br>
side to crashing civilian airliners into skyscrapers and in beating women if they dare
<br>
show a naked elbow in public, and sending anthrax in the mail.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;a bit one-sided or slanted from the true situation.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, She's right, you can call me one sided John, I think mass murder is wrong and there
<br>
is no other side. I also refuse to look at the good side of somebody trying to kill me.
