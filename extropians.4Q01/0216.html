</em><br>
<p>Fatal flaws, my ass.

<p><em>&gt; Physical immortalists are working to accomplish longer, open-ended

<p>Yeeep. At least, they should be working, and not just mouthing off about
<br>
it. (Which reminds me of something, I'm just not sure about what).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; another kind of immortality that has existed for thousands of years

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>This better be good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Noospheric immortality, in a Classical Humanist sense, is accomplished

<p>Classical Humanists have no clue about physics, nor do they wish to get
<br>
into posession of said clue. Otherwise, they would stop being Classical

Humanists, and become somebody else.

<p><em>&gt; the progress and well-being of future generations of mankind. Those

<p>I don't care about future generation. Well-being of future generations is
<br>
a side effect of personal immortality in the rational selfishness context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; future generations, in a Classical Humanist education system, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strive to relive the original discovery of the new physical principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as they themselves prepare to uncover still newer universal physical

<em>&gt; principles. By living in such a &quot;simulteneity of eternity&quot;, with great

<p>Garbage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; minds of the past, future generations lead to yet more human expansion

</em><br>
<em>&gt; neccessary to significantly increasing human lifespan.
</em><br>
<p>More garbage. This is so new-agey, it makes me want to puke.
<br>
<p>Immortality. Now. That's the kickstarter. And you know what, we could pull
<br>
it off, if we try hard enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Within the context of Classical Humanism, proponents of physical
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of future human generations and thus &quot;making their mark in the world&quot;
</em><br>
<p>They must have skipped to install that &quot;human satisfaction&quot; module in this
<br>
unit at the fab. Thank you, I can get my &quot;meaning&quot; elsewhere. If you get

my &quot;meaning&quot;.

<p>The Classical Humanist way is to feed the worms, I thought?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; maximize the possibilities for presevering and extending their own

<p>By feeding the worms?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; economic progress that leads to true wealth creation and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress that recognizes human equality and that serves to limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oligarchic tendencies in society. Conversely, people who tend toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Classical Humanist values will find physical immortalism a much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive idea worth working on because Classical Humanist physical
</em><br>

<p>WTF is noospheric immortality?

<p><em>&gt; immortalists, on the other hand, consider only personal physical

<p>Ha! Ha! Ha!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; physical immortalism within a Classical Humanist framework, the idea

</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself and, in addition, become more quickly achievable than through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other set of social, political and economic ideas. If cryonicists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are looking for a way to increase their numbers, Classical Humanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserves to be examined thoroughly.
</em><br>
<p>Nope.
