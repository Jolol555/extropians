I don't think I'm buying it.
<br>
<p>&quot;method of rewiring any solar panel so as to double its
<br>
power output&quot;
<br>
<p>That should immediately set off a red flag. *DOUBLE* its
<br>
power output.  Jeeesh, folks at Spike's Ranch would be
<br>
beating down the door to this guy on the basis of weight
<br>
reduction alone.  Less weight in solar cells means much
<br>
more weight in telephoto lenses, fuel for orbital adjustments,
<br>
tape or memory for storage, sensors across more frequencies,
<br>
etc., etc.
<br>
<p>I would have to suspect there &quot;prior art&quot;?  The patent was
<br>
filed Dec 1983.  I can't believe that Skylab, MIR, etc.
<br>
did not have their solar cells and batteries wired up
<br>
in series.
<br>
<p>Here are the claims:
<br>
<em>&gt; 1. A solar powered battery charging system, comprising a series string of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; n rechargeable battery cells, a plurality of series strings of charging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources of m solar cells each, and means for connecting a different one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said strings of m solar cells directly across each of said n battery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells for bidirectional current flow between connected battery cells and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strings of solar cells to provide shared charging of each of said battery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells by all of said solar cells. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. A solar powered battery charging system, comprising a series string of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; n unloaded, rechargeable battery cells, a plurality of series strings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charging sources of m solar cells each, and means for connecting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different one of said strings of m solar cells directly across each of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said n battery cells for bidirectional current flow between connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battery cells and strings of solar cells to provide shared charging of each of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said battery cell by all of said solar cells. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. In a solar-powered battery-charging system, a battery charging method,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprising the steps of connecting a plurality of rechargeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battery cells in series; connecting across each said battery cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respectively a different plurlaity of series connected solar-cells for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bidirectional current flow, and exposing the solar-cells to sunlight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereby each of said battery cells is charged sharingly by all said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar-cells. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. The method of claim 3, wherein said battery cells ar maintained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unloaded during battery charging. 
</em><br>
<p>I think one would have to look at the architecture of every
<br>
solar powered satellite in the '60s and '70s to determine
<br>
whether or not the patent is valid.
