<p><p>ANCIENT SECRET SYSTEM MOVE MONEY GLOBALLY
<br>
<p><p>By DOUGLAS FRANTZ
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/03/international/03LAUN.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/03/international/03LAUN.html</a>
<br>
<p>UETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 2 - With nothing more than a telephone and a 
<br>
fax machine, Tarir Khan transfers money almost anywhere in the world 
<br>
- no questions asked, no names used and no trail for law enforcement 
<br>
to follow.
<br>
<p>Mr. Khan is a small cog in a far- reaching network of informal 
<br>
banking known as hawala, the Arabic word for trust. Although it is 
<br>
illegal in most countries, including here in Pakistan, authorities 
<br>
estimate that billions of dollars flow unseen by regulators through 
<br>
the hawala system worldwide.
<br>
<p>A senior government official in Pakistan said law enforcement 
<br>
authorities were certain that Osama bin Laden's network used hawala 
<br>
to transfer money to agents outside Afghanistan, along with 
<br>
conventional means. But the nature of hawala will make tracking those 
<br>
particular exchanges almost impossible.
<br>
<p>In the Kandahari bazaar here, many hawala dealers are concentrated in 
<br>
a five-story concrete building that resembles a bunker, its interior 
<br>
dark and its offices lighted by dim bulbs.
<br>
<p>Outside, donkey-drawn carts vie for space with Toyota Land Cruisers, 
<br>
and three-wheel motorized rickshaws dodge bangled buses and 
<br>
pedestrians.
<br>
<p>The absence of women, save a couple of beggars, is striking. In 
<br>
Pakistan and Afghanistan, money business is men's business.
<br>
<p>Anyone can walk into a hawala shop in Quetta or a thousand other 
<br>
cities in southern Asia, put down a stack of cash and ask that the 
<br>
sum be transferred to a recipient in another country.
<br>
<p>Mr. Khan and his associate, found sitting cross-legged on the floor 
<br>
of their sparse office and sipping tea, keep transactions in a brown 
<br>
notebook on Mr. Khan's desk. When he receives a telephone call or a 
<br>
fax to confirm that money has been picked up elsewhere in the world, 
<br>
the relevant page is torn out of the notebook.
<br>
<p>Even the new scrutiny prompted by the terror attacks on Sept. 11 is 
<br>
highly unlikely to disclose all the details of how Mr. bin Laden's 
<br>
money moves through the ancient system. Mr. Khan, for one, refuses to 
<br>
divulge the cities where he has associates, saying he fears the 
<br>
authorities.
<br>
<p>&quot;This system is made for transferring enough money to get a pilot's 
<br>
license or make a deposit on an apartment without raising an 
<br>
eyebrow,&quot; Prof. Nikos Passas, an expert on transnational crime at 
<br>
Temple University and a consultant to government agencies, said in a 
<br>
telephone interview.
<br>
<p>Finance Minister Shaukut Aziz, a former executive vice president of 
<br>
Citibank in New York, said $2 billion to $5 billion moved through the 
<br>
hawala system annually in Pakistan, more than the amount of foreign 
<br>
transfers through the country's banking system.
<br>
<p>Pakistan is trying to draft laws to regulate the industry. But for 
<br>
now it thrives illegally in places like the Kandahari bazaar.
<br>
<p>A United States Treasury Department study identified hawala as the 
<br>
principal means of money laundering from drug trafficking and other 
<br>
crimes in Pakistan. The report said Pakistan, India and Dubai on the 
<br>
Persian Gulf form the &quot;hawala triangle&quot; to move money secretly 
<br>
worldwide.
<br>
<p>In hawala, sums large and small are sent halfway around the world on 
<br>
a handshake and a code word. Records of transactions are kept just 
<br>
until the deal is completed. Then they are destroyed.
<br>
<p>No cash moves across a border or through an electronic transfer 
<br>
system, the places where authorities are most likely to spot or 
<br>
record the transaction.
<br>
<p>The sender does not have to provide his name or identify the 
<br>
recipient. Instead, he is given a code word, which is all the 
<br>
recipient needs to pick up the same amount of cash from an associate 
<br>
of the original trader. The transaction can occur in the time it 
<br>
takes to make a couple of phone calls or send a fax.
<br>
<p>The system was in place long before Western banking. The ancient 
<br>
Chinese used a similar method called &quot;flying money,&quot; or fei qian. 
<br>
Arab traders used it as a means of avoiding robbery along the Silk 
<br>
Road.
<br>
<p>Millions of Pakistanis, Indians, Filipinos and other people from 
<br>
southern Asia working in foreign countries use the system to send 
<br>
money home to relatives.
<br>
<p>&quot;They don't feel comfortable walking into a bank,&quot; Mr. Aziz said in 
<br>
an interview.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's very dangerous to talk about this, because it is illegal,&quot; Mr. 
<br>
Khan, who arrived in Quetta from Afghanistan many years ago, said 
<br>
this afternoon as a colleague shook his head and told him to keep 
<br>
quiet. &quot;I can't tell you much.&quot;
<br>
<p>Trust, he said, is the essential quality of a hawala trader. Most of 
<br>
his customers are from the same part of Afghanistan. So there is an 
<br>
innate sense of trust.
<br>
<p>He said transfers were usually sent among family members and involved 
<br>
a few hundred dollars. Sometimes transactions are for as little as 
<br>
$50.
<br>
<p>He provides a five-digit code word, a letter and four numbers, that 
<br>
the recipient takes to one of Mr. Khan's associates as far away as 
<br>
the United States, Germany or Russia. The same associates accept 
<br>
money for transfer to relatives in Quetta.
<br>
<p>&quot;They tell the code word, and we hand over the money,&quot; he said. &quot;Then 
<br>
we tear up the records on both ends.&quot;
<br>
<p>Most hawala merchants charge a small commission, usually $5 for 
<br>
transfers up to $500 and $10 for up to $1,000.
<br>
<p>Their main profit comes from currency fluctuations and extra fees for 
<br>
moving money for big clients.
<br>
<p>The system is used for far larger sums, often by drug traffickers, 
<br>
corrupt politicians and black market traders, according to local 
<br>
experts and law enforcement.
<br>
<p>&quot;The drug dealers, the politicians who get kickbacks and others with 
<br>
black money use this system,&quot; said Kamran Mumtaz, editor of The Daily 
<br>
Mashriq, a newspaper in Quetta.
<br>
<p>Authorities have found evidence that hawala has been used for 
<br>
payments by smuggling rings and militant groups in the disputed 
<br>
territory of Kashmir and the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, Professor 
<br>
Passas said. &quot;This is the most convenient, common and cheapest system 
<br>
of moving money,&quot; he said. &quot;It is also one of the most difficult to 
<br>
track.&quot;
