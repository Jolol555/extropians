<br>
<p>### Your argument sounds quite plausible, however, there is a problem: it
<br>
means that any Christian, Jew, Muslim, or any other theist who believes in a
<br>
personal afterlife, acts cowardly by dying in a war. The bomber crews in WW
<br>
II, most of whom were theists, and bombed civilian or mixed
<br>
civilian-military targets (the firebombing of Tokyo, Berlin, Dresden), must
<br>
have been cowards who knowingly attacked civilians and gladly went into the
<br>
storm of AAA fire, hoping for eternal bliss if things go south.
<br>
<p>Is this the kind of conclusion you are drawing?
<br>
<p>If meanings of words are stretched to fit the emotionally charged moment,
<br>
soon all meaning is lost. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps you could provide a definition of cowardice, a general one, fitting
<br>
all situations.
<br>
<p>The 911 perps were scared (as we can infer from their writings) they
<br>
overcame their fear. If they were cowards, the WTC would be still standing.
