<p>
<em>&gt; 	When I read the article, I thought it sounded like someone I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew; myself.  I took the test and scored a 31, although I could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer all the questions.  I have not attempted to obtain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional diagnosis, as I am not sure what good, if any, it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.  Oh well, I guess I'm outed now.
</em><br>
<p>Since you mentioned so, I would like to inform you that I had Asperger's. Last December I read about autism on MSNBC and did a
<br>
massive literature search on it. Later I got myself dx-ed and confirmed it. I also knew a few real people with autism and more on
<br>
the Net. I got 42 for the test.
<br>
<p><p>Having a dx has great importance, even if symbolic. It can help one come to terms with oneself. It can help you get disability
<br>
payment if you can't stay in a job. It can help explain to others about your difference.
<br>
<p>However, proceed with care on this issue. Some insurance companies irrationally do not insure autistics (ACs), even high
<br>
functioners. Some employers irrationally refuse to hire autistics even if the autistics have all the skills neccessary to do their
<br>
work, or do it better than the NTs who require constant socialising (they call this &quot;eating snake&quot;, sort of like laziness, in
<br>
Chinese dialect).
<br>
<p>This only adds to problems with finding jobs, as I read and received first hand accounts of stories of ACs who either dislike their
<br>
jobs very much and have to quit to avoid social burnout, or cannot stay in their job because, while technically very competent, they
<br>
can't get along with anyone (including the boss).
<br>
<p><p>I suggest those interested in enquiring more contact me privately, unless you think you don't mind discussing it in public and that
<br>
what you discuss has relevance to extropian issues.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 	Since I read the article, I have been examining my memories of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people I have met in my life to see if I could identify any others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a possible diagnosis of Aspergers syndrome and any commonalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they share.
</em><br>
<p>I found a few lecturers suspected of having autism. The absent minded, boring and non-social professor provides a good sterotype of
<br>
autism. Educational institutions provide relatively places for autistics to seek employment.
<br>
<p>Quite a few of ACs go into entrepreneurship, combining their independent spirit with creativity. They do find themselves in a
<br>
disadvantage when they have to comply with apparently irrational social norms to entertain.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Am I way off base here?
</em><br>
<p>Probably off-topic, but not neccessary not off-base.
<br>
<p>It seems like despite their relatively low concentration in our societies, they have a disproportionate influence especially in the
<br>
fields of science and technology. Some famous inventors and discovers have autistic traits, such as Albert Einstein and Thomas
<br>
Edison. The concept of &quot;mad scientist&quot; probably came from some NT observing how some of these people act and think.
<br>
<p>ACs have an advantage when it comes to originality. They can conceive solutions that others had not figured out while NTs tend to
<br>
follow the trend. When you do not let the opinions of those around you, as well as past cultural thinking weigh you down, you can
<br>
let your mind roam freely. When you do not need to socialise and go to mundane social activities such as mindless shopping, you
<br>
spend your time thinking and learning.
<br>
<p>[Not all autistics, however, have interest in science and technology. Some of them like art much more than science.]
<br>
<p><p>Meanwhile, it seems more likely than AC researchers can develop and create the first sentient AI or singularity, while NT politicans
<br>
will more likely attempt to stop these on irrelevant or superfacial religious or other grounds.
<br>
<p><p>Meanwhile, these sentient entities will most likely have autistic tendencies than NT tendencies. You might not realise how much
<br>
non-verbal information passes from one person to another and also all the varients of this &quot;non-standard&quot; transmission system.
<br>
<p>Definitely, we would find it easier to build a non-human sentient computer (as in not an uploaded mind or directly based on human
<br>
neural systems) without the need to take such eloborate rituals and systems into account.
<br>
<p>This holds despite the marketing people's desire to cater to the majority NT population by constructing &quot;socialable&quot; computers. Some
<br>
say that the engineering and marketing people never fit, probably because one contains mostly &quot;hard-core&quot; ACs and the other mostly
<br>
&quot;hard-core&quot; NTs.
<br>
<p><p>I hereby predict that the influence of ACs will increase as technology progresses in our societies. While NTs fear &quot;impersonal&quot;
<br>
computers, ACs take to them as (sort of like) friends. While NTs use technology to communicate with each other, ACs make discoveries
<br>
about this world and develop new technologies to better the world. While the NTs go shopping, the ACs read books in the library.
<br>
<p>The tables had finally started turning on the socialites; the time has come for the geeks to take over the world. :)
