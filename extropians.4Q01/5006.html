<p>
Me too.
<br>
<p>A very good post, although I disagree with some of the singularitian
<br>
aspects - but we can discuss my cluelessness and its origins later.
<br>
<p>The important issue is that transhumanism is unlike most other
<br>
philosophies, that often claims there is a *single* goal, a *single*
<br>
desirable state or value to strive for - if you don't, you are wrong. In
<br>
transhumanist thought there are *many* things to be desired, many
<br>
possible ways of being. Some of them might not even be comparable to
<br>
each other. If we are to accept this pluralistic view, then we have to
<br>
accept that other beings are going to choose their own goals and we
<br>
cannot fault them for making choices different from ours. That there are
<br>
many good choices doesn't mean there aren't bad or immoral choices we
<br>
should work against - tolerance is not the same thing as acceptance of
<br>
evil. We might have a lot of views on (say) spirituality and what bodies
<br>
to be, but we all agree that stealing and killing is generally wrong.
<br>
<p>What is important is to be united about what matters. That goes for both
<br>
transhumanists and mindkind. 
<br>
<p>I do not believe we will get species wide unity by thinking about AI.
<br>
But it might be refreshing.  Would the emergence of AI, uploads or mere
<br>
transhumans make us more tolerant? I doubt it. In fact, without
<br>
tolerance I do not believe such forms of existence can come about, or if
<br>
they do, exist in a peaceful manner. Tolerance is not the result of
<br>
achieving transhumanist visions, but a *prerequisite* of them! As
<br>
Eliezer described, being exposed to the idea that aliens and robots are
<br>
people too at an early age helped create a strong tolerance, and I have
<br>
no doubt thinking about transhumanist themes can have the same effect.
<br>
But if the transhumanism is just about uploading and how to manage
<br>
singularities, then it is little more than another genre of science
<br>
fiction. What is really needed is the underlying ethical ideas - the sf
<br>
mentioned was largely based on and expressing the western liberal canon
<br>
ideas, and got its theme and direction from this. In the same way
<br>
transhumanism needs to work on developing the web of underlying ethical
<br>
ideas fully in order to be more than speculations about future toys, and
<br>
have a realistic chance of affecting our culture in order to make our
<br>
visions realizable.
