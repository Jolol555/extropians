<em>&gt;&gt; So how do you propose to measure the immense loss of valuable goods

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;They wouldn't be &quot;priced out&quot; if the goods they could have created were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really of such immense value.  The funds they would receive from selling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their valuable goods would allow them to purchase the information they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needed for production.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This would make sense if the transaction costs associated with selling
<br>
information and associated with negotiating the rights to the IP were
<br>
zero. I deny that this is an good approximation to the truth.
<br>
&nbsp;Anyone familiar with open source software can see that there is a large
<br>
class of derivative works for which nonmonetary rewards are enough
<br>
incentive to motivate the creation of works, but the transaction costs
<br>
associated with charging money for those works probably exceed the benefits.
<br>
&nbsp;A comparison of the fraction of derivative works in the open source world
<br>
to the fraction in the world of proprietary IP probably demonstrates that
<br>
the costs of negotiating the right to create derivative works affect
<br>
the availability of derivative works. A $10000 legal fee might be trivial
<br>
for a cancer cure, but it is hardly trivial for a piece of software that
<br>
would provide the author with $100 worth of improved reputation.
