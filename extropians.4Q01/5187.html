From: &quot;Kai Becker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;00bf01c18dd7$5f56e5a0$3f5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; From the data in <a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/rpp/07/ch6.pdf">http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/rpp/07/ch6.pdf</a> I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, that the USA are a rather violent country, compared to other western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries as well as Japan.
</em><br>
<p>I'd say it really doesn't serve any useful purpose to characterize the US as
<br>
&quot;rather violent.&quot;
<br>
The hundreds of millions of people who live in America probably have much more
<br>
diverse concerns than any analysis of violent behavior could ever reveal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't find any correlation between population, density of population and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the crime statistics.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps the following will help you to discover the relationship between
<br>
population density (ie, overpopulation) and crime rates.
<br>
<p>Population and Social Stresses
<br>
<a href="http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1998/7/98.07.03.x.html#d">http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1998/7/98.07.03.x.html#d</a>
<br>
&quot;The Tragedy of the Commons,&quot; written by Garrett Hardin 20 years ago serves as
<br>
a simple, yet excellent illustration which explains some of the social
<br>
stresses due to competition evident today. Competition due to overcrowding
<br>
exacerbates conflict, in a neighborhood, state country or region. One person's
<br>
gain is another's loss. Given one pie--be it finite natural resources or
<br>
available full-time jobs--adding additional consumers must be at the expense
<br>
of others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The law systems are almost similar, except the gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws. But since cities like Washington, DC and Chicago are comparable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; London, Frankfurt and Sydney, it's unclear to me why Washington has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homicide rate 29 times higher than London and Chicago 8.5 time higher than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berlin.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it's probably unclear to the mayors of Washington, DC, and Chicago why
<br>
their cities have high homicide rates. So, it's no surprise that this should
<br>
be unclear to the rest of us as well. If there were a proven method of
<br>
eliminating crime and violence without infringing civil liberties, we wouldn't
<br>
need to discuss this.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
