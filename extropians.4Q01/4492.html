<em>&gt; enough to have alleged moral impact, but not great enough to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsifiable.  In other words, hint-dropping.  If there really is a future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mind with technology capable of supervening on present-day reality to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent of influencing human cognition, and that Mind cares enough to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drop hints is probably sufficient to construct nanobot servos.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can tweak a neuron firing you can probably tweak a protein folding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There is &quot;no reason&quot; true enough except that it might simply be
<br>
how the post-SI Mind decides to do things here for now.  If I on
<br>
this side of the Singularity can come up with plausible reasons
<br>
for a choice of limited involvement then I see no way to dismiss
<br>
the possibility out of hand.  On reason is to actually expand
<br>
the number of sentient aspects without having them engineered
<br>
completely but grown in a different milieu slowly.  Perhaps this
<br>
is seen as a way to acheive a leading edge that is not so
<br>
predictable.  Just a guess, of necessity.   
<br>
<p>Spirituality is quite falsifiable.  Try it on.  If it doesn't
<br>
improve your life and open up your options in a way that is
<br>
worth something to you then discard it.  Don't expect to weight
<br>
something that rich and intricately part of life with
<br>
rationality and logic alone though.  Not if you really want to
<br>
know.
<br>
<p>Why should the effects be blatant?  Perhaps part of whatever
<br>
this sim is set up for, or especially if it is the Mind's own
<br>
past, will be harmed by anything too blatant.  This especially
<br>
works well with the time-travel model.  Improve slightly but not
<br>
so drastically as to jeopardize the timeline.  Sufficent to do X
<br>
and X being advisable within the constraints of the situation
<br>
are quite different things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But anyway, this hypothesis about reality - that spirituality represents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drawing on a real, external source of knowledge, where this knowledge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more accessible to humans who place themselves in particular emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states - is a straightforward one, and one to which I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforwardly reply &quot;You're wrong.&quot;  And you can reply &quot;You're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.&quot;  And there, I think, things rest, unless you'd like me to try and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlace your faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The states are not simply emotional.  They are not easy to
<br>
acheive although some of us seem wired naturally to get some
<br>
partial success.  Your simple reply is unworthy of you imho. 
<br>
How can you know if you haven't tried for yourself?  If you have
<br>
an airtight argument that justifies your &quot;You're wrong&quot; then
<br>
please give it.  I will bet it is one I have used on myself to
<br>
talk myself out of spirituality at least once.  But who knows, I
<br>
might be surprised.  I don't think my &quot;faith&quot; will be easy to
<br>
&quot;unlace&quot; just now.  I've done so myself many times.  Yet it
<br>
relaces itself more elegantly and unanswerably in my life over
<br>
and over again.  At some point I must go with something that is
<br>
so much a part of me.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way to look at spirituality is the search for and acheiving of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some bit of such access.  Another way to look at it is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; projection of the greatest dreams, hopes and determination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humanity projected as already existent and of help.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; projection can greatly help us focus and move forward even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you only believe it is a projection.   It is timeless by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; construction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what way is a &quot;projection of the greatest dreams, hopes, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determination of humanity&quot; mystical?  We have dreams, we have hopes, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have determination.  I try to nurture it in myself and others.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to break the laws of physics in order to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Mystical&quot; is a word.  The projection I speak of is not just
<br>
what you can intellectualize about, plus dream about some
<br>
aspects of it.  It is a weaving of the hearts as well as the
<br>
minds of humanity.  It is the creation of a sustaining and
<br>
deeply enrolling and even ennobling vision but made deeply
<br>
personal.  Where did I break any laws of physics in noting the
<br>
power of that?  You seem to be responding here to something
<br>
somewhat different than what I spoke of. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As you know, Samantha, I'm not as violent a critic of all that seems or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be labeled &quot;spiritual&quot; as most of those on the Extropian list.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's legitimate to say, for example, that the Singularity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended &quot;to heal the darkness in the human spirit&quot;, because I can, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary, define exactly what I mean by 'darkness' and why I expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity to heal it.  In other words, the &quot;spiritual&quot; statement is here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a legitimate approximation to a more specific and technical argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the vague images invoked by &quot;heal the darkness in the human spirit&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are actually in good accord with these specifics, and since the emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invoked center on goals which I myself share, I judge it ethical to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that phrase in explaining the Singularity to a nontechnical audience.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter of pragmatism, I wouldn't use that phrase in front of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian conference, or even a computer conference, because I know that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority or sizeable minority (respectively) will be very strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allergic to any argument that uses a spiritual phrasing, and also that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academic audiences view spiritual argument as a special case with specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connotations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But how much do we rob ourselves by couching our words and what
<br>
moves us deeply in terms of other people's limitations or
<br>
cumfort zones?  I have held my own heart back many times because
<br>
I could not express what I was deeply called to in a way that
<br>
would reach this or that community I was in or some group of
<br>
friends that I deeply esteem.  Is it our ethics keeping us from
<br>
possibly afronting someone or is it protecting ourselves from
<br>
being judged and possibly misunderstood and/or rejected? 
<br>
Speaking for myself there are tinges of both in such
<br>
deliberations.  
<br>
<p>I would also point out that if you wish to move much of the
<br>
population of the world in a more positive direction the
<br>
language of spirituality is quite important.  And it is
<br>
spirituality that gives rise to most living ethical systems
<br>
today.  We have yet to acheive a strong ethical system using
<br>
reason alone.  Creating a world that is viable and forward
<br>
moving requires ethical, political, psychological and
<br>
sociological aspects as well as technological/scientific ones. 
<br>
I don't believe the necessary work can be done with
<br>
reason/rationality as usually understood alone.  If you know how
<br>
it can be I would very much like to hear it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Spiritual shorthand is ethical where it arrives at a correct conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *for correct reasons*, where any emotional appeal is based on shared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals, and where more specific arguments can't be used due to constraints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on time or audience.  But I don't think the shorthand is more powerful.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's shorter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is your construction that spritual speaking is &quot;shorthand&quot;.  
<br>
There are spiritual images, concepts, experiences, teachings
<br>
that simply do not translate into the language of
<br>
rationality/logic/reason no matter how long you speak and how
<br>
patiently intellectual you assume your audience is.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Mystical argument, though, is always incorrect - it invokes causes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects which do not exist in reality.  Only someone who genuinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes in those causes and effects can ethically use a mystical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am unclear what you believe constitutes a mystical argument. 
<br>
However, it seems there is a hint of a question as to what I do
<br>
and do not believe in this statement.  
<br>
<p>I believe in a transcendent Mind not limited to what we
<br>
currently understand through science and that that Mind is
<br>
immanent as well and is interested and under certain conditions,
<br>
at least somewhat accessible.  I have little choice but to
<br>
believe this as I have experienced it firsthand.  Yes, I could
<br>
come up with rationalizations to &quot;debunk&quot; each such experience 
<br>
and the ones that I could possibly have in the future.  But at
<br>
some point the effort to &quot;debunk&quot; them becomes less believable
<br>
and more contrived than accepting such as also valid.  That is
<br>
the point I have reached and passed in my own life.  
<br>
<p>Also, I understand how to weave all the elements of what I care
<br>
about in life and how I envision the future and how we might get
<br>
from here to there onto the framework of my acceptance of these
<br>
spiritual things.  I never succeeeded in weaving all of it onto
<br>
a strictly rational framework.  It wasn't from lack of many
<br>
years of trying.
<br>
<p>And finally, this &quot;sings my heart&quot;.  You may dismiss that as
<br>
emotionalism if you wish.  But it is important to me as I do not
<br>
operate at my best, much less enjoy life much without it.
<br>
<p>So there you have it.
