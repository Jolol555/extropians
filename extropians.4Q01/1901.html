</em><br>
<p>Well, I've never associated with any known terrorists. If I were, I'd
<br>
likely take it as such a slight on my personal honor to be associated
<br>
with such an individual as to seek to clear up any questions about the
<br>
association. 
<br>
<p>That is, of course, unless I thought the 'terrorists' were in fact
<br>
freedom fighters and that my government was a fascist tyranny. In which
<br>
case, I'd fully expect that government to treat me badly and take
<br>
measures in such a frame of mind. If apprehended, I'd likely make claims
<br>
about my civil rights being violated, being fully aware that as far as
<br>
that society was concerned, such protestations are purely for propaganda
<br>
purposes. Relative to that society, I would completely understand that I
<br>
was the enemy, and proper strategy for me would be to seek to further
<br>
undermine it by trying to push that government into behaving (or being
<br>
perceived as behaving) in a far more extremist manner than it actually
<br>
is or is preceived to be. More extremism on my enemy's part will recruit
<br>
more people to my cause, and their strategies should also be to increase
<br>
the extremism of our opponents until enough of the population is pissed
<br>
off by that government that it rises up and overthrows it.
<br>
<p>Do you see how people like Samantha, et al, by harping on how 'bad' our
<br>
government and society are, contribute to the cause of the enemy, in
<br>
this light?
<br>
<p>I am sure Samantha says what she does entirely from the best of motives.
<br>
I just don't think she thinks this through entirely.
