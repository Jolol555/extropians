<em>&gt; &gt; Outside of the US, it has been more the rule than the exception that to

<em>&gt; &gt; the people more than the rest (it even occurs here). Since time
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Untrue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's an equillibrium condition that shows up when the tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreads so widely that a majority of the voters are affected; after a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while they start to vote for tax cuts. As witness the UK during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1980's and 1990's, or the US more recently.
</em><br>
<p>And it is always structured to make as many on the low end completely
<br>
untaxed as possible. Currently in the US, if you make less than about
<br>
$31k and have at least one dependent, you pay no taxes or get more back
<br>
from the government than you pay. This constitutes nearly a majority of
<br>
the population. With the most current tax cuts, this level climbs to
<br>
$31,600, which is a majority (average hourly wage is $15 and change).
<br>
<p>The poorest 51% always vote to tax the richest 49% as much as possible,
<br>
and give themselves as many tax breaks as possible. They may give a few
<br>
crumbs to the rich, but generally the poor pay less and less as time
<br>
goes on. When voter registration standards rise, this trend tends to
<br>
reverse.
