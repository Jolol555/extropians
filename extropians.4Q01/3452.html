Friends,
<br>
<p>--- Anders Sandberg &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20neo-luddites%20are%20&quot;US%20Taliban&quot;%20%20(was%20Re:%20&quot;Cloning%20Breakthrough&quot;%20not%20one)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20011127193003.2730.qmail@web13501.mail.yahoo.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt; wrote:

<p>&quot;While this is a good point, it should be noted that
<br>
this is not the core reason they are against cloning.
<br>
They are against cloning, IVF and abortion because
<br>
they are sides of the same big concept: humans 
<br>
controlling human reproduction. To the religious, this
<br>
throws out God from the circuit, to the green it
<br>
throws out the wisdom of nature and to the general
<br>
romantic it suggests that we put our reason and
<br>
planning above the natural. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>...the furor and political strength of this movement
<br>
is worth noticing. Make no mistake, we are setting
<br>
ourselves up as champions of *everything* they are
<br>
against.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*****************
<br>
<p>The events beginning with Sept 11th have given George
<br>
Bush an undeserved degree of importance and
<br>
self-importance.  On almost every conceivable front
<br>
this is an incredibly dangerous development.  The
<br>
instant he declared in his Sept. 20th speech that &quot;the
<br>
war against terrorism&quot;  would go on for a long
<br>
time--on that very instant I suspected that he and his
<br>
team had found the solution to the presidential
<br>
legitimacy problem brought on by his feeble electoral
<br>
experience and his subsequent supreme court
<br>
presidential installation.  His open-ended, seemingly
<br>
semi-permanent war seemed, in a stroke, to turn
<br>
Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; from fiction to chilling prophecy.
<br>
<p>Until now I'd felt the concern over the neo-luddite
<br>
movement (such as expressed by Greg Burch) to be
<br>
overblown.  But the artificial amplification of George
<br>
Bush from presidential place-holder to global
<br>
warrior-king has shaken my optimism.  It is said that
<br>
the US system of government--the constitution, the
<br>
separation of powers, the bill of rights, the nation
<br>
of immigrants, etc--is resilient, and resistant to the
<br>
carnage wrought across the historical landscape by the
<br>
witch's brew of ambition-plus-power-plus-enraptured
<br>
sycophancy.  Well, buckle up, folks, cause that
<br>
resiliency is about to be put to the test. 
<br>
<p>Bush's declaration  of the &quot;immorality&quot; of cloning is
<br>
the shrieking call to jihad of the American Taliban. 
<br>
How bitterly ironic if the better angels of the
<br>
American spirit should mobilize the rescue, halfway
<br>
around the world, of islamic victims of islamic
<br>
fundamentalist psychopathology, only to empower and
<br>
then be set upon by homegrown demons of fundamentalist
<br>
atavism.
<br>
<p>Enough of this &quot;support the president&quot; crap.  Of his
<br>
father it was said--ok, it's a cheap shot, but it's
<br>
damn funny just the same--that &quot;he was born on third
<br>
base and thinks he scored a triple&quot;.  For Dubya we
<br>
need an update; I suggest, &quot;he was born on second base
<br>
and thinks he scored a triple.&quot;  I'm willing to
<br>
believe that Bush is a man of good character, and that
<br>
he can competently lead--which is to say
<br>
cheerlead--the war against terrorism, but the evidence
<br>
of his limitations suggests that beyond that,
<br>
confidence and support should be replaced by caution
<br>
and serious criticism.
<br>
<p>I would add that, to whatever extent the extremist
<br>
right and extremist left are a threat to progress in
<br>
this world, that a perfect and memetically timely
<br>
opportunity exists to attack and severely curtail
<br>
their political influence by comparing them to the
<br>
Taliban and Al Queda.  
<br>
<p>Christian fundamentalists with their biblical law and
<br>
abortion-clinic assassins are the American equivalent
<br>
of the Taliban with their Shari-a and
<br>
throwers-of-acid-in-the-face-of-un-burquaed-women, and
<br>
the anti-tech eco-terrorists and power-addicted PC
<br>
ideologues of the extreme left are the American
<br>
equivalent to the hate-filled, dogma-driven,
<br>
anti-west, anti-modern, jihad psycho-killers of Al
<br>
Queda.  I would do everything possible to spread,
<br>
promote, suggest, convey, and in short, hammer home
<br>
that analogy, apt as it is.  Rinse and repeat.
<br>
<p>Then we might just get out of this with our freedoms
<br>
intact.      
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Enough's enough.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
