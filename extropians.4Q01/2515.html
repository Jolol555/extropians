Thomas Diflo, a doctor in New York, gives after-transplant care to patients 
<br>
who received organs in China from executed prisoners. Though he believes such 
<br>
transplants are morally wrong, Dr. Diflo says doctors must provide care no 
<br>
matter what their patients have done.

<br>
&lt;&lt;HANGHAI, Nov. 8 â€” Three years ago, in New York, one of Dr. Thomas Diflo's 
<br>
patients on a long waiting list for a kidney transplant showed up with a new 
<br>
problem: she no longer needed a kidney, but suddenly needed after-transplant 
<br>
care.
<br>
<p>&quot;She had just returned from a trip to China and, to my surprise, had 
<br>
undergone a transplant while she was there,&quot; said Dr. Diflo, of New York 
<br>
University Medical Center, where he is director of kidney transplants.
<br>
<p>The woman, a Chinese-American, was vague about where the kidney had come 
<br>
from, but others who have come to Dr. Diflo for treatment have been more 
<br>
forthcoming, confiding that they got the organs of executed Chinese 
<br>
prisoners.
<br>
<p>Kidneys, livers, corneas and other body parts from these prisoners are being 
<br>
transplanted into American citizens or permanent residents who otherwise 
<br>
would have to wait years for organs. Many of the patients come back to the 
<br>
United States for follow-up care, which Medicaid or other government programs 
<br>
pay for.
<br>
<p>The transplants in China, which doctors in both countries say are increasing, 
<br>
has presented the American medical establishment with an ethical quandary: 
<br>
Should American doctors treat patients who have received organs from executed 
<br>
prisoners and, if so, would they be tacitly condoning the practice and 
<br>
encouraging more such transplants.
<br>
<p>Or should they rebuke patients who, in desperation, participate in a process 
<br>
that mainstream transplant advocates condemn as morally wrong?
<br>
<p>&quot;That's a decision that has to be made by each individual physician,&quot; said 
<br>
Dr. Thomas McCune, a transplant physician in Norfolk, Va., and chairman of 
<br>
the patient care and education committee of the American Society of 
<br>
Transplantation. &gt;&gt;
