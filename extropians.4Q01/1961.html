U.N. Report: Robot Sales Boom, Private Ones Still To Reach Potential
<br>
Vast Majority Of Robots Used By The Manufacturing Industry
<br>
Huge Potential To Mechanize U.S. Postal Service
<br>
<a href="http://cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,316359-412,00.shtml">http://cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,316359-412,00.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>(AP) Sales of industrial robots have risen to record levels and they have
<br>
huge, untapped potential for domestic chores like mowing the lawn and
<br>
vacuuming the carpet, according to a new U.N. report.
<br>
<p>The report, released Wednesday, predicted that the number of robots used in
<br>
tasks as diverse as assembling cars, cleaning sewers, detecting bombs and
<br>
performing intricate surgery would continue to grow in the coming years.
<br>
<p>&quot;Robots are getting better and better and cheaper and cheaper,&quot; said Jan
<br>
Karlsson, author of the U.N. Robotics 2001 survey published by the U.N.
<br>
Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics.
<br>
<p>An average robot sold in 2000 would have cost only a fifth of a comparable
<br>
model in 1990, he said.
<br>
<p>The report said some 100,000 new robots were installed worldwide in 2000,
<br>
nearly half of them in Japan, the biggest user, which increased its purchases
<br>
by 32 percent after a slump the previous year.
<br>
<p>European Union countries bought 30,000 new units, and North America, 13,000.
<br>
The market was worth some $5-6 billion.
<br>
<p>It said there were nearly 750,000 industrial robots in existence at the end of
<br>
last year. This was likely to rise to 975,600 by the end of 2004.
<br>
<p>The vast majority of robots were used by the manufacturing industry. But
<br>
increasingly, they had uses off the assembly line, said the report.
<br>
<p>For instance, it said there were 3,000 underwater robots in use last year,
<br>
2,300 demolition robots and 1,600 surgical robots.
<br>
<p>Some 50 robots for fire fighting and bomb detection and detonation were in
<br>
service. Karlsson said Israel was the main country using robots to detect and
<br>
blow up explosive devices. The same robots could also be used in de-mining, he
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Asked whether robots could be used to replace postal workers in the wake of
<br>
the anthrax scares, Karlsson said there was huge potential to mechanize the
<br>
U.S. postal service.
<br>
<p>Some 1,000 robots were installed last year to sort parcels, he said. The U.S.
<br>
postal service estimated that it had the potential to use up to 80,000 robots
<br>
for sorting work although existing models were not suitable for sorting
<br>
letters, he said.
<br>
<p>The report predicted a big increase in domestic robots for vacuum cleaning and
<br>
lawn mowing from 12,500 at the end of last year to 425,000 by the end of 2004.
<br>
<p>Plans to market robotic vacuum cleaners had been put on hold until next year
<br>
as manufacturers tried to bring their price down to make them more
<br>
competitive. They would probably take three times longer to clean a carpet
<br>
than their human-powered equivalent and would likely have problems with
<br>
tassels on the end of rugs.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's much faster to do it manually but you have to be there,&quot; said Karlsson.
<br>
<p>The grass-cutting robots in use either solar- or battery-powered were also
<br>
much slower than their more traditional rivals and could not cope with long
<br>
grass, he said.
<br>
<p>But their low power did have certain advantages.
<br>
<p>&quot;It doesn't matter if your children and dogs are running around on the grass
<br>
at the same time,&quot; he said.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
