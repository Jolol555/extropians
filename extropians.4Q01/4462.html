<em>&gt; I know of no ways we are acting that are not right.  Where would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we get that information if not thru negotiation?  That information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must come thru legitimate governments.  If the taliban have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with American troops in Saudi, they must take it up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Saudi government.  Likewise with the Israeli government.  Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they afraid to do this?  Why?  
</em><br>
<p>You have certainly heard about the ongoing war between Israel and the 
<br>
Palestinians. There is terror from both sides, suicide bombings against 
<br>
high-tech missiles, hate and fear for fifty years now. An interesting 
<br>
system of conflicting but self replicating memes, btw.
<br>
<p>You may then wonder, why such a small state as Israel still stands and 
<br>
seems to be the only flourishing country in the region. One of the reasons 
<br>
are billions of dollars, mostly from people in the US. Without this money, 
<br>
Israel would have seized to exist thrirty years ago or so. This feeds the 
<br>
opinion of many people in the middle east, that the USA are the enemy 
<br>
behind and therefore is a wrong way. (Other reasons have to do with the 
<br>
natural resources of the Israel/Palestine region, that Israel has occupied. 
<br>
They use it almost for free for their farms, while palestinian farmers have 
<br>
to pay for their own water.)
<br>
<p>You have probably heard that the U.N. made several initiatives to stop the 
<br>
killing and promote a peace process. But do you also know the long list of 
<br>
resolutions of the security council that were stopped because of US veto? 
<br>
Samantha called it the knee-jerk reflex, and it is just that. The leading 
<br>
nation of the world ignores international law and only uses it when it 
<br>
suits its own interests. This is why many people have no faith in 
<br>
international institutions but only in violence. This is therefor a wrong 
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>There are several militant groups in every country in the middle east, even 
<br>
in Saudi Arabia. So, there is already war and terror in the middle east. 
<br>
But it seems that it was very easy to ignore, unless it came right into 
<br>
your house. Ignoring the problems of others in an interdependend world is, 
<br>
as we see, a wrong way.
<br>
<p>One last example. The US president very easily got 40 billion dollars to 
<br>
arrange the largest weapon test of the last decades. With these 40 billion 
<br>
dollars, they could have bought the whole country of Afghanistan several 
<br>
years ago, when they left the Mudshahed alone, build nice cities with 
<br>
schools and hospitals and no Taliban would have gained power and no bin 
<br>
Laden would have had a chance to set up terrorist camps. Leaving former 
<br>
allies alone is therefore a wrong way.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai
<br>
<p>P.S. There is still more. You can find a long list of wrong ways in Noam 
<br>
Chomskys book &quot;Rogue States : The Rule of Force in World Affairs&quot;.
