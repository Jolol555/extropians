</em><br>
<p>The question is: does the wave function represent reality or
<br>
knowledge (lack of knowledge) ? I think that QM is a double-speaking
<br>
theory. Sometimes speaks about things (Schroedinger's cat is real,
<br>
experiments performed), sometimes about informations (Rothstein, 
<br>
Brillouin, Heisenberg, Adami, Cerf, Zeilinger, Mermin, etc.).
<br>
<p>Have a look. Let's have a 2-state entangled quantum system, and 
<br>
observers A and B (far away). A performs some measurement on his side 
<br>
of the system. From this measurement A gets some information, 
<br>
in terms of density matrix, about the other side of the system.
<br>
But B, who does not know what measurement, if  any, was permormed
<br>
by A, must continue to use his (usual, previous) density matrix, 
<br>
describing his side of the entangled quantum system. 
<br>
<p>That's all? No, of course. We must add the *physical* condition.
<br>
The product of the 2 density matrices (observer A and B) should 
<br>
not be zero. Otherwise those 2 observers may contradict each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason they don't say this is because you can in principle bring the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles back together and show interference effects which would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible if they had well defined spins.  If physicists had adopted the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stance you describe, they would be forced to say that once the boxes were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought near each other the particles had lost their well-defined spins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or positions), which is absurd.
</em><br>
<p>When boxes are separated interference effects are lost (definitively). 
<br>
Decoherence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a fundamental difference between these quantum effects and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical phenomenon of two boxes only one of which contains a particle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the quantum case it is clear that there is no well-defined state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the measurement is done.  In the classical case this is not true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It confuses the issue to suggest that these two situations are similar.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps. But the *single* particle issue is interesting, also
<br>
in connection to the EPR - Bell argument, and possible

experiments. References below.
