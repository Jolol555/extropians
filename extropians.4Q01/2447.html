<p>Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  It's hard to say, but this war looks to be like the
<br>
Cold War or the War on Drugs -- one that will probably outlast the President
<br>
and much of the leadership on all sides.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nation-building is the only strategy that ever worked for America.  It is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope for the Afghani is that the war drags on until 2005 and we get a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Can you give any examples of nation-builing working?  What exactly do you
<br>
mean by it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sigh.  Don't you wish McCain was in office right now?
</em><br>
<p>NO!  In fact, I wish he would just go into retirement.
<br>
<p>If there was any good outcome of the 2000 elections it is that McCain did
<br>
not make it to the Presidency.  Not only is he one of most corrupt
<br>
Senators -- hardly ever met a lobby he didn't like -- but his policy
<br>
perscriptions are basically just welfare statism all over again plus a good
<br>
dose of international interventionism.  He's even hinted at being pro-Draft.
<br>
(See &quot;Is the Draft in Your Future? Recruiting Shortfalls Reopen An Old
<br>
Debate&quot; by Brian Mitchell reprinted from _Investors Business Daily_ 1999
<br>
February 19 issue at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/fullarticle.asp?record=158&month=05">http://www.mises.org/fullarticle.asp?record=158&month=05</a> .)  Even where
<br>
McCain has the best of intentions, his reforms would probably make things
<br>
worse or, at best, distract from the real problem.  (See, e.g., &quot;The
<br>
Corruption of Reform&quot; by Jude Blanchette at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/fullarticle.asp?record=625&month=30">http://www.mises.org/fullarticle.asp?record=625&month=30</a> .)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
