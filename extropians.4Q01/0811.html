<em>&gt; &gt; So, here is the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should access to information be based on accreditation?
</em><br>
<p>Others have stated the problems with gaining the education to be
<br>
accredited if the information is restricted, but Eric brought up an
<br>
example of the flip side:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Both MM and AA enjoys advantages (and corresponding disadvantages) in accordance to their status.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rights &amp; Limitations of &quot;Aspiring Apprentices&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .       Prohibition from Free Discussion of &quot;Dirty&quot; Politics, Violence &amp; Pornography
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rights &amp; Limitations of &quot;Mentally Mature&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .       Prohibition from doing anything of great future consequences with AA
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but could an AA not then become mature, though deliberately
<br>
tricking the system (say, by simply declining to declare MM status),
<br>
and then exploit the MMs' prohibitions while using a pseudonym or
<br>
similar to get around the limits on discussion?  Even if some acts were
<br>
traced to the AA, the MMs could not do anything that would
<br>
significantly limit the AA's future.
<br>
<p>Basic problem: legal categorization of people is imperfect.  If it
<br>
benefits people to exploit the difference between the law's intent and
<br>
its reality, people will do so.  (Ideal systems can be imagined, but
<br>
historically, any attempt to implement always introduces bugs.  Merely
<br>
saying &quot;this one will be perfect&quot; has, when tried, only resulted in
<br>
less attention being paid to actually fixing the bugs.)
<br>
<p>This is a problem with the accreditation, too, since &quot;accredited&quot; and
<br>
&quot;not accredited&quot; are but legal categories in this case.  However, here
<br>
the abuse is more likely to be by those who do the acceditation, since
<br>
there are few benefits to not being accredited, but many perceived
<br>
(and, IMO, mostly false) ones to making sure that people you do not
<br>
personally know and trust can not exploit a field of knowledge.
