<p>
I'm coming into this conversation involving Alex and Ken.  I haven't
<br>
investigated the details/background so I am ill-informed (buyer beware).
<br>
<p>I'll simply state a personal experience.  Sometime last year one of
<br>
my credit cards was billed for multi-4-figure amounts.  This turned
<br>
out to be charges from someplace in the U.K. presumably executed
<br>
by individuals connected with the theft of a large number of credit
<br>
card numbers and perhaps access codes in Russia (well documented
<br>
by the Moscow Times).
<br>
<p>I don't know whether they broke the electronic access code encryptions
<br>
on the cash machines or simply found a clever way around the normal
<br>
authorization methods.  But they found a way through the system and
<br>
exploited it big time.  The net result was that I signed a piece of
<br>
paper indicating that I did not make the charges and my credit card
<br>
company had to swallow this loss.  Now I'm sure I and other customers
<br>
are paying for this in the form of higher interest rates on outstanding
<br>
loans (the shareholders or management don't lose -- the clients do).
<br>
<p>So I'm forced to agree with Ken -- there are bad (EVIL!) people out
<br>
there who will exploit the system -- so &quot;trust&quot; that people are
<br>
legitimate purchasers who will pay is essential.  I'd also agree with
<br>
Alex that there *should* be purchases that I can make &quot;anonymously&quot;.
<br>
Given recent events I'd also argue that there should be purchases that
<br>
one *CANNOT* make &quot;anonymously&quot; (e.g. chemicals for the production of
<br>
Sarin, microorganisms that produce human toxins, DNA synthesizers, etc.)
<br>
I think the dividing line lies someplace in the realm of the ability
<br>
to produce something that can &quot;assault&quot; another entity.
<br>
<p>I question the value of being able to anonymously purchase (or download)
<br>
anything from &quot;Crack-Attack&quot; software to guns.  The dividing line is this --
<br>
if something can only be used for defensive purposes, you should
<br>
probably be able to purchase it anonymously -- if something has an
<br>
offensive use, its anonymous purchase should be regulated.
<br>
<p>Most probably a very slippery slope.
<br>
<p>Regarding personal privacy and security we are obviously entering
<br>
a *very* interesting time.  I can imagine people who have piercings
<br>
of various body parts, the knowledge of which they would like to
<br>
keep &quot;private&quot;.  Now however, as soon as they hit the metal detectors
<br>
at the airports things are likely to get a *bit* interesting...
<br>
Its not likely to be an offensive *or* defensive weapon -- but how
<br>
do you know this for sure?
<br>
<p>Robert
