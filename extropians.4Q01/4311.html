<em>&gt; Such attitude maximizes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chances that entities indistinguishable on the software level from my

<em>&gt; current self will exist in the future, which is exactly the objective of

my
<br>
<em>&gt; survival instinct.
</em><br>
<p>Jaques:
<br>
<p>The desire that evolution has built into our brain is for procreation
<br>
(and survival only as far as it favors procreation).
<br>
<p>### I do have a desire for procreation, quite independently from a desire to
<br>
live, and vice versa - I do wish to survive even if it meant no procreation
<br>
(well, there other pleasant ways of spending my time...).
<br>
<p>While I would agree that in lower animals all or almost all drives and
<br>
desires can be related to the task of passing their genes on to the next
<br>
generation, I would say that for us humans the situation is different - we,
<br>
especially extropians dreaming about radical physical and mental
<br>
enhancements, are not slaves of our genes anymore. Our thoughts and desires
<br>
have long since transcended the boundaries of genetic determinism, sometimes
<br>
resulting in losses (as in people joining monasteries) but at other times
<br>
promising great individual benefits. This applies especially to us - many of
<br>
us would be willing to discard or greatly change our genes, if needed for
<br>
individual survival. I am an information processing device, fully devoted to
<br>
the task of continuing my existence (and the existence of sufficiently
<br>
similar copies), while respecting the rights of other information processors
<br>
to keep doing what they want.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
&nbsp;So the quest for
<br>
individual immortality is in contradiction with the way nature has
<br>
made us, it is a rejection by the individual of the plans that
<br>
nature has for him (being a temporary support for a stream of life).
<br>
<p>### Exactly! And I say: Down with nature! Long live me! Don't ask what you
<br>
can do for your genes, ask what they can do for you!
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>The &quot;copy&quot; conception of survival (that you hold) seems closer to the
<br>
original &quot;gene&quot; conception of survival (in fact, genes only survive as
<br>
copies), while the &quot;continuity&quot; conception seems to follow more naturally
<br>
from the specific desire of individual immortality.
<br>
<p>### You do have a point here - there is a similarity between my self-concept
<br>
and the way genes work. We care about our copies. If my self-concept works
<br>
as good as the genetic paradigm, I would have reasons to be very optimistic
<br>
about my future.
<br>
<p>The continuity concept, however, is in my opinion quite similar
<br>
(functionally) to the survival concept a stone might have. A stone doesn't
<br>
wish to copy itself. It cares only about itself. It resists blows and heat
<br>
but eventually its individual existence will end. When the Sun becomes a red
<br>
giant, even the oldest stones of old will be melted and will &quot;die&quot;, while
<br>
some of the distant and vastly improved copies of the first genes might
<br>
escape (if we take them with us).
