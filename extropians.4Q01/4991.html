<p>Isn't  Bradbury the guy who said to me that  Extropianism is mainly
<br>
about precipitating the Singularity and the rapid rate of chage needed
<br>
to do so? And that Extropianism might require sacrificing (in as many
<br>
words) ourselves so as to bring about the Singularity? And something
<br>
about acorns and oak trees?  Do I have to partake of the body of the
<br>
Singularity (or is it the Friendly AI?) before I am changed?
<br>
<p>The people who do most of the posting here are not really concerned
<br>
with immortality, but instead with the Singularity., 
<br>
<p>That pretty much goes along with the general tenor of this list,
<br>
specifically the rampant political correctness and and rigid adherence
<br>
to neoconservative &amp; Randian doctrine.

<p>Well, good, but we had better rein in CorpGovMedia, or pretty soon
<br>
America will essentially be a Latin American country. 
<br>
<p>Honestly, how many Latin American countries do you think would support
<br>
a middle and lower middle class cryonics movement?  The answer--none!
<br>
The 3rd worldization of America may be fine for doctors, such as
<br>
yourself and wealthy law firm partners and those made wealthy by the
<br>
stock market lottery (immigration only helps them by giving their
<br>
wealth more leverage)--they may simply  increase 100 fold the dues for
<br>
cryonics and fortify cryonics facilities.  But mass 3rd world
<br>
immigration may be a death sentence for the rest of us.  That fits in
<br>
nicely with Randian doctrine, eh.  But you may want to rethink
<br>
that--although pro immigration propaganda spewed by CorpGovMedia
<br>
states that such 3rd world countries (with people of color) are ever
<br>
so tolerant...what a colossal joke!
<br>
<p>BTW, Alcor membership dues ~$400/yr...
<br>
<p>And to answer those on this list who would accuse me and other of
<br>
&quot;xenophobia&quot;, I do not like the cultures of those who come to this
<br>
country from the 3rd world.  You don't like it when I publicly voice
<br>
my feelings about immigration and the relative worth of cultures?
<br>
Tough titty!
<br>
I will continue to voice my feelings on this matter, as it is HIGHLY
<br>
relevant to our purported joint quest for physical immortality.
