<p>Well, mass is a precious commodity for spacecraft, so one tries to make
<br>
the most of it, while maximizing energy generation, thus high efficiency
<br>
is highly useful for spacecraft needing to get from point A to B.
<br>
<p>With a large, uninhabited landscape like Luna, efficiency is not so
<br>
necessary. You've got plenty of mass, you don't have to worry so much
<br>
about Luddites protesting against ruining that lunar ecosphere (though
<br>
I'm sure some fools will try to do so (hey, that may be an effective
<br>
counter-luddite propaganda movement, which will make them look like
<br>
fools to everyone else)) or displacing valuable farmland or other real
<br>
estate.
<br>
<p>One thing to worry about, though, will be people objecting to the idea
<br>
that the earthbound view of the moon would be somehow altered by large
<br>
scale construction of solar farms there. This can easily be countered by
<br>
TV ads showing computer generated before and after images showing
<br>
absolutely no recognisable change at human-capable resolution (it might
<br>
be even more effective if used at resolutions equivalent to that of some
<br>
other animals, like eagles, etc).
<br>
<p>The strongest segment of the NIMBY/luddite movement at the present, at
<br>
least in rural areas, is widespread objections to alterations of
<br>
landcape views created by cellphone towers in rural/wild areas. You get
<br>
wealthy cityfolk who pay big bucks to buy/build their 'country retreats'
<br>
and they are the biggest opponents to anyone else in the community
<br>
developing their property, especially in ways that don't fit their
<br>
naive, Rockwell/Parrish-inspired ideas of what country living should be
<br>
like.
<br>
<p>Doing a visible alteration to the near side of the moon would create
<br>
similarly huge opposition on a global scale, if only by those who want
<br>
to screw up the plans of Americans for their own resentment/rivalry
<br>
based reasons.
<br>
<p>For this reason, it may be preferable to make solar farms as efficient
<br>
as possible, to reduce the footprint on the earthside view. I think it
<br>
would be a good idea to run up some computer simulations with graphic
<br>
output to mockup how various farm layouts with various degrees of ground
<br>
coverage would impact the view at various resolutions. Coming up with
<br>
layouts and ground coverage percentages that would be undetectable at
<br>
eagle resolutions would help mitigate environmentalists claims that such
<br>
farms would somehow significantly alter the way that animals perceive
<br>
the moon, since it is allegedly of importance to how some animals
<br>
navigate, etc...
