<em>&gt; I have no doubt we are going over old ground here. However, its a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truism that correlation does not imply causation. Lots of things have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed in the UK over the last hundred years. It would be a stretch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to imply that guns, or their lack, are responsible for all these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From the data in <a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/rpp/07/ch6.pdf">http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/rpp/07/ch6.pdf</a> I would 
</em><br>
say, that the USA are a rather violent country, compared to other western 
<br>
countries as well as Japan.
<br>
<p>I can't find any correlation between population, density of population and 
<br>
the crime statistics. The law systems are almost similar, except the gun 
<br>
laws. But since cities like Washington, DC and Chicago are comparable to 
<br>
London, Frankfurt and Sydney, it's unclear to me why Washington has a 
<br>
homicide rate 29 times higher than London and Chicago 8.5 time higher than 
<br>
Berlin. In terms of violent crimes like homicide and robbery, I'd rather 
<br>
expect such high numbers in countries without a stable, law enforcing 
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>There are 334 citizens per square kilometer living in Japan, 229 in 
<br>
Germany, but only 27 in the USA. That means that Japan and Germany are 
<br>
almost as crowded as New York (ca. 250 c/sq km). Obviously this factor 
<br>
alone doesn't make living in Japan or Germany more unsafe, even though guns 
<br>
are outlawed in both countries.
<br>
<p>Could it be more unsafe to live in rural areas? The density in Australia is 
<br>
2.4 c/sq km (Canada: 3.4), but the homicide rate is only 1,8/100,000 
<br>
persons, which is in the same range as Germany or Canada, and far away from 
<br>
the US.
<br>
<p>There must be other factors responsible for these differences. Gun laws and 
<br>
population alone are not. I'd therefore say, that the pro and con 
<br>
discussion about owning guns is far from being rational. But this isn't 
<br>
really new, or is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my observations, including the style of discussion and the kinds of 
</em><br>
arguments read here, I think it's a question of 1) mentality (including 
<br>
social culture) and 2) fear.
