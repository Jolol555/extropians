I often had similar thoughts on the cultural differences between
<br>
Europeans and Americans, in particular the different risk taking
<br>
attitudes. We are talking statistics here and of course one cannot
<br>
overgeneralize, but on average it is a fact that Americans are a bit
<br>
less reluctant to move, drop a steady job to start a business, etc.
<br>
And, on average, Europeans who populated America were a bit more
<br>
adventurous. Perhaps he Italian diaspora to the US (I would say, 1880
<br>
to 1920) is a good example. There are many pre-1950 Italian novels
<br>
with examples of villages where the smartest young people left for the
<br>
hope of a better future in America. So perhaps Americans have it in
<br>
their genes to be more willing to accept risk for a given reward.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've observed the effect that Jacques discusses in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;U.S. -- historically the less risk averse migrated West.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In modern times one tends to see young people migrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the less conservative coasts, esp. say New York,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;San Francisco, or L.A.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What I think is at work is a &quot;risk aversion&quot; or &quot;adventure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embracing&quot; gene (or genes).  Migrating always has risks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated with attempting to survive in unknown environment.
