<p><em>    &gt;Farhi and Guth concluded that &quot;to create conditions in a small region

</em><br>
<p>According to the old ideas you'd need a particle accelerator about the size
<br>
of the galaxy to make a black hole, and in the present economic climate
<br>
you're unlikely to get a grant to make a machine that big.  However there
<br>
are some new ideas that there may be more than 3 dimensions of space,
<br>
perhaps 10.  The reason we don't notice the other 7 is that at small (and
<br>
perhaps not ridiculously small) dimensions they curl back on themselves.
<br>
If so then at small dimensions the attraction of gravity is proportional not to the
<br>
square of the distance as all textbooks say but to the power of 9.  If so then
<br>
at small distances if you cut the distance between two particles in half the
<br>
gravitational attraction between the particles is not 4 times greater it is 512
<br>
times greater. If any of this is actually true then if would be one hell of a lot
<br>
easier to make a black hole than had been thought. If it's true that is, we should
<br>
know in just a few years.

<p>Energies that CERN will be able to produce in 3 or 4 years.

<p>Cosmic rays might be making them all the time, but the smaller a black hole is
<br>
the shorter its lifetime before it evaporates by Hawking radiation. The Black Holes
<br>
we're talking about are very small and would last, I don't know, a million billion
<br>
trillionth of a second or so.
