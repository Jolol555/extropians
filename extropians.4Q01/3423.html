`HAL's Legacy' examines state of artificial intelligence
<br>
BY PETER DELEVETT
<br>
<a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/opinion/wiretap/pd112701.htm">http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/opinion/wiretap/pd112701.htm</a>
<br>
``I'm sorry, Dave, but I'm afraid I can't do that.''
<br>
<p>Thus spake HAL, the murderous supercomputer in ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' But
<br>
though the year 2001 is nearly over, ultra-smart computers that can talk,
<br>
think and kill even better than humans are still a long way off.
<br>
<p>How far off? That's the question mulled in a new documentary, ``2001: HAL's
<br>
Legacy,'' that debuts at 11 tonight on PBS.
<br>
<p>``There are some areas where we've met and surpassed the technology,'' says
<br>
David Stork, a Menlo Park scientist who wrote and narrated the documentary.
<br>
``We have much better computer graphics than HAL ever showed.''
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the film points out that even Deep Blue, the IBM
<br>
supercomputer that bested chess master Gary Kasparov, can't do most things a
<br>
2-year-old child can, like understand that water is wet. Heck, Deep Blue
<br>
doesn't know how to play checkers.
<br>
<p>Such challenges make artificial intelligence ``one of the most difficult
<br>
questions in all of science,'' says Stork.
<br>
<p>Stork is a HAL nut. He recalls seeing ``2001'' as a 13-year-old, which kindled
<br>
his love of science. He's now chief scientist of Menlo Park-based Ricoh
<br>
Innovations, an R&amp;D subsidiary of Japanese copy machine maker Ricoh. In his
<br>
spare time, Stork moonlights as a consulting associate professor of both
<br>
electrical engineering and computer science at Stanford.
<br>
<p>The license plates on Stork's BMW read, ``HAL 9000.'' A private collector even
<br>
loaned him the original faceplate for HAL, the only surviving scrap of set
<br>
from the 1968 film.
<br>
<p>For the film version of ``HAL's Legacy,'' which is based on Stork's 1997 book
<br>
of the same name, he flew to Sri Lanka to interview the octogenarian author of
<br>
``2001,'' Arthur C. Clarke. The film also features cameos by Intel co-founder
<br>
Gordon Moore and a slew of artificial-intelligence experts at Stork's alma
<br>
mater, MIT.
<br>
<p>The documentary finds these brainiacs tinkering with things like voice
<br>
synthesis, computer optics, robotics and other technologies to help computers
<br>
see, hear, emote and understand the way we do. It's cool stuff. (For a sneak
<br>
preview, check out <a href="http://2001halslegacy.com">http://2001halslegacy.com</a>).
<br>
<p>The documentary's airing coincides with a two-week run of the original
<br>
``2001'' now under way at San Francisco's Castro Theatre, where Stork shot
<br>
part of the film. Since shooting wrapped, Stork's devoted a fair amount of
<br>
time to promoting the project. Two weeks ago, he was partying down at a gala
<br>
honoring Clarke at the Playboy Mansion in L.A.
<br>
<p>Also in the crowd were Danny Hillis, chairman of Applied Minds, and Greg
<br>
Papadopoulos, chief technology officer of Sun Microsystems. Science isn't
<br>
always pretty, but someone has to do it.
<br>
<p>THE NAME GAME: He co-founded disk-drive pioneer Shugart Associates, ran the
<br>
company for four years and eventually sold it to Xerox. But he's not valley
<br>
legend Al Shugart: He's Don Massaro, who in the annals of Silicon Valley is
<br>
something of the Fletcher Christian to Shugart's Captain Bligh.
<br>
<p>Now Massaro's taken the helm of a new vessel, Campbell start-up ClickArray
<br>
Networks, which helps clients manage their Web traffic. On Monday, the firm
<br>
named Massaro chief executive officer and shortened its name to Array
<br>
Networks.
<br>
<p>The old name ``sounded too dot-commy,'' says Massaro, who worked for Al
<br>
Shugart at IBM and Memorex before helping found Shugart Associates in 1973. A
<br>
year later, the firm's board ousted Shugart and named Massaro president.
<br>
<p>Shugart and Massaro haven't spoken since. But Shugart went looking for a
<br>
little payback when he later founded another legendary tech name, Seagate
<br>
Technology.
<br>
<p>Seagate began life in 1979 as Shugart Technology; Shugart says he was hoping
<br>
Xerox would sue the fledgling firm and in the process drum up publicity. When
<br>
that didn't work, he began casting for a new name.
<br>
<p>Explains Shugart, who's now a venture capitalist in Santa Cruz: ``I was
<br>
looking for a seven-letter word that started with an S, had a G in the middle
<br>
and ended with T.'' Ironically, he ended up getting booted from Seagate in
<br>
1998. I'll bet he used a few seven-letter words then, too.
