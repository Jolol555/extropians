<p>### Full agreement here. I would imagine that the proper immigration law
<br>
would, among other measures, do the following: eliminate family-based
<br>
immigration, sell citizenship to anybody able to pay (price modified by
<br>
credits for age, health, and education verified by passing American tests -
<br>
SAT, GME, USMLE), and set the price of citizenship to maximize the income
<br>
generated after subtracting the costs of assistance to the immigrants.
