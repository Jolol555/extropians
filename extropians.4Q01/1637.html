</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. This is criticized as a contradictory stance-- not only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquishment of tolerance and relativism, but a selective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquishment.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't this kind of like saying that &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; is bad because it's a
<br>
selective relinquishment of cooperation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In order to maintain this strategy, it is shielded
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Why does the use of a &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; policy need to be shielded from
<br>
scrutiny?  And I wasn't even proposing that... just noting that
<br>
Afghanistan simply does not possess the military capability to wipe out
<br>
the US, no matter how much they may wish to do so, and that it is not a
<br>
coincidence that we are a tolerant democratic society and they are not. 
<br>
Whether our current attack on them is justified is an entirely separate
<br>
issue.
<br>
<p>We are not in danger of being wiped out by intolerant societies because
<br>
intolerance is an economic disadvantage is a military disadvantage.  We
<br>
thus do not need to relinquish any of our tolerance to survive.  Indeed,
<br>
such a strategy would be counterproductive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1a. Furthermore, when an ends-justify-means calculus is employed, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up with the problem of entrusting somebody with the priviledged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position of deciding which ends justify which which means. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly AI might do it Eliezer, but even the best intentioned humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitably lapse into &quot;MY ends justify the means&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>There are three settings on the dial here, not two.  It's not &quot;Hitler&quot; and
<br>
&quot;Gandhi&quot;; it's &quot;Hitler&quot;, &quot;Churchill&quot;, and &quot;Gandhi&quot;.  The Churchill form is
<br>
widely recognized as not being equivalent to the Hitler form.
<br>
<p>In a two-player game, then yes, both parties can claim to be Churchills
<br>
and bash away on each other using &quot;ends justify the means&quot;.  This is
<br>
unavoidable because each individual *does*, de facto, have the privileged
<br>
position of deciding what to do.  In the larger multiplayer game, the
<br>
other players observe your actions and judge whether you're really a
<br>
Churchill or a Hitler.
<br>
<p>As for your statement that the best intentioned humans &quot;inevitably&quot; lapse,
<br>
I think your statement is historically incorrect.  Sure, some humans
<br>
lapse.  Not all of them.  The French Revolution failed as the
<br>
revolutionaries turned themselves into absolute rulers for the populace's
<br>
own good - but the US Revolution did pretty much okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. This contradiction may percolate backwards as the relinquishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes less and less selective, ending in an intolerant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutist society.
</em><br>
<p>What does tolerance have to do with military retaliation, much less
<br>
military defense?  Being tolerant does not prevent me from responding to
<br>
an invasion of my own borders.  You asked whether tolerant countries would
<br>
be wiped out by intolerant ones, not whether tolerant countries could or
<br>
should invade intolerant ones.  My answer is that tolerant countries have
<br>
not been successfully invaded by intolerant countries due to the inferior
<br>
technology of intolerant countries, and that the relation between
<br>
tolerance and technology is more than coincidence.
<br>
<p>If Afghanistan ever becomes as superior to the US as the US is currently
<br>
superior to Afghanistan, no amount of tolerance or intolerance will save
<br>
us; they will simply invade and wipe us out and that will be that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This reminds me of those sims that fuse Prisoner's Dilemma and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cellular automata so you have neighborhoods of cooperators and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defectors forming and reforming. Defectors can never be completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiped out, because as long as they are surrounded by cooperators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll thrive at their expense. However, they can never prevail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because a neighborhood composed only of defectors will starve and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterprising cooperators move in and recolonize it.
</em><br>
<p>Tit for Tat wipes out defector colonies easily enough - and without
<br>
launching a first strike, either.  We can do one better than this because
<br>
not only are tolerant democratic countries technologically superior, they
<br>
also tend to support each other.  They will even support defender
<br>
intolerant countries against aggressor intolerant countries, albeit to a
<br>
lesser degree.  Intolerant countries tend to make worse cooperators than
<br>
tolerant countries.
