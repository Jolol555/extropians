Have any extropians heard a meteor? I live in a very rural area where it's
<br>
quiet at night, and I think I heard one (not a Leonid, it was last Spring)
<br>
that actually shook my whole house as it hit the Earth (I speculate not too
<br>
far away). It sounded like &quot;...zzzzzzzzt!&quot; ...like an amplified bass woofer
<br>
with slight doppler effect change in frequency might sound if hurtling toward
<br>
an observer, and I think it was entirely acoustic rather than VLF radio as
<br>
described in the article below.

<br>
<p>Listening to Leonids
<br>
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast26nov_1.htm?list76937">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast26nov_1.htm?list76937</a>
<br>
November 26, 2001: All at once there was a eye-squinting flash of light and a
<br>
strange crackling noise. Puzzled sky watchers looked at one another ... and
<br>
confessed: &quot;Yes, I heard it, too.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hearing meteors? It could happen -- and indeed it did, plenty of times during
<br>
this month's Leonid meteor storm.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am sure I could hear several of the meteors,&quot; recalled Karen Newcombe, a
<br>
Leonid watcher from San Francisco -- one of many who reported meteor sounds to
<br>
Science@NASA on Nov. 18th. &quot;Several times when a Leonid with a persistent
<br>
debris train flew directly overhead, I heard a faint fizzing noise
<br>
[instantly].&quot; There was no delay between the sight and the sound.
<br>
<p>&quot;How is that possible when the meteor was so many miles above my head?&quot; she
<br>
wondered.
<br>
<p>The same question has bedeviled some of history's greatest scientists. For
<br>
example, in 1719 astronomer Edmund Halley collected accounts of a
<br>
widely-observed fireball over England. Many witnesses, wrote Halley, &quot;[heard]
<br>
it hiss as it went along, as if it had been very near at hand.&quot; Yet his own
<br>
research proved the meteor was at least &quot;60 English miles&quot; high. Sound takes
<br>
about five minutes to travel such a distance, while light can do it in a
<br>
fraction of a millisecond. Halley could think of no way for sky watchers to
<br>
simultaneously hear and see the meteor.
<br>
<p>Baffled, he finally dismissed the reports as &quot;pure fantasy&quot; -- a view that
<br>
held sway for centuries.
<br>
<p>Yet just last weekend scores of people little inclined to fantasy heard the
<br>
Leonids. The sounds weren't rumbling sonic booms or the loud crack of a
<br>
distant explosion arriving long after the meteor's flash had come and gone.
<br>
Rather, these were exotic, delicate noises, heard while the meteor was in full
<br>
view. Scientists call them &quot;electrophonic meteor sounds.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meteor listeners have long been reluctant to report their experiences -- a
<br>
result of Halley-esque skepticism. But hearing a meteor doesn't mean you're
<br>
crazy. Indeed, modern researchers are increasingly convinced that the
<br>
electrophonic sounds are real.
