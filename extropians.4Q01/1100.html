Forwarded from a list I subscribe to - a story of how to create hope,
<br>
something we all need these days. Hope you enjoy it.

From: &quot;Jack Brittain&quot; 
<br>
<p>I ran across a remarkable story last night in the Chronicle of Higher
<br>
Education. CHE runs a story in every issue on offbeat research areas. In
<br>
the October 12 issue there is a story on Lawrence Myers, who is a
<br>
professor of veterinary medicine at Auburn University. His academic
<br>
specialty is detector dogs, who are used for drug sniffing, explosives
<br>
detection, search and rescue, and other types of smell-based detection.
<br>
There is a funny story about a dog trained for drug detection whose
<br>
lessons were not well structured and ended up being the world's best
<br>
nose for finding plastic bags. There is also another story in the
<br>
article that really struck me as poignant and illustrative.
<br>
<p>In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, search and rescue dogs
<br>
were used. The teams were searching for survivors, but ultimately they
<br>
were finding bodies for removal from the wreckage. After a few days
<br>
working the scene, all the dogs quit working. They just would not get on
<br>
task and were pulling away from the site. Dr. Myers was called in to try
<br>
to figure out what was wrong, if there was something hazardous the dogs
<br>
were reacting to, or any other reason they would no longer work. After
<br>
looking over the dogs and surveying the site, he decided the problem was
<br>
the dogs were depressed. They were trained to find living people, and
<br>
they knew they were not finding people alive, they were finding bodies.
<br>
His solution was to enlist some of the volunteers to hide in the
<br>
wreckage so the dogs could find some people alive. After going through
<br>
this exercise, the multiple dogs involved all went back to work and were
<br>
able to persist in the body search, although with more frequent breaks
<br>
and some sporadic opportunities to experience success.
<br>
<p>In the most hellacious of circumstances, the dogs needed to find a spark
<br>
of life to keep going. And with nothing more than a moment of hope and
<br>
joy, they were able to do the job that had to be done.
