<em>&gt; &gt; The interesting question though is whether there is a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable standard of living and dignity.  As we near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Singularity I am certain we will eventually need to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this question.  I am pretty sure we already do need to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best solution, absent a Singularity and the plenty it might bring,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to adopt free market policies throughout the globe, including a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for individual negative rights, especially property rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That &quot;solution&quot; doesn't even address the question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Query: As we reach hyper-abundance and most manufacturing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; near totally automated, exactly why would you require every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adult to have a normal job in order to have a stake in and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; access to that plenty?  It is quite easy to see there would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no meaningful work for them that anyone would care to hire them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for not far down the road at all.  What then?  In a world of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plenty why is scarcity based thinking concerning &quot;earning&quot; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; living appropriate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think if such a period of plenty comes about, then a lot of things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will change and it will be hard now to predict the exact course.  Plenty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is also a relative term, since what is plenty to one person might be not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to another.  I think, however, economic concerns might switch to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other areas, but see below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the thing holding the Third World back is not the lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; World foreign aid, but the lack of respect for property rights (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Hernando De Soto's -- the Peruvian economist NOT the Spanish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In a world where all material items (except fixed land resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and so on) can be had simply by asking the local nanobots to dig
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up the pattern and produce it, what exactly would property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights apply to and why would you care?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, we're not there yet and free markets work right now.  No need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much R &amp; D on that front, just implement them and the benefits will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think some of us better thing about what is coming before it
<br>
gets here.  I also think getting to Singularity can potentially
<br>
be limited by thinking in pre-Singularity terms exclusively and
<br>
even defending pre-Singularity, pre-abundance assumptions when
<br>
they are no longer defensible.  We are seeing such things in
<br>
microcosm now imho in the music recording industry attempts to
<br>
mandate that their middleman roles continue even if they have to
<br>
seriously entangle and limit all relevant technology to do so.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Second, given nanotech, scarcity will not necessarily disappear, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move to other areas, such as information.  (Of course, nanocomputing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might make it less and less necessary to get good new designs from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.  If that's the case, as trade declines, society will probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less and less society and more and more just a bunch of loose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affiliations.  Or so I speculate!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Information will not in the least be scarce.  It has the funny
<br>
property of actually becoming more valuable as it is shared and
<br>
combined wih other information and new thought and insight
<br>
(mostly).  With current digital technology we can already share
<br>
information much more broadly and cheaply than we know how to
<br>
deal with.  
<br>
<p>I would suspect more loose affiliations myself
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Also, the Lockean-Randian justification for private property is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans need material resources to live.  In other words, property is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounded in life.  Nanotech does not erase that need.  You can still die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or be denied things.  It will be much harder and the incentives for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime and conflict will definitely shift -- probably eliminating a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of rivalries and the like, but not all of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Some of that justification is based on scarcity fundamental
<br>
assumptions that increasingly will not be accurate reflections
<br>
of reality.  Nanotech does indeed have the potential to erase
<br>
much of that assumption.  Property is grounded in the
<br>
assumption, not in life per se.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Okay, I've got a lot of studying to do -- unless that Singularity gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here quick!:)
</em><br>
<p><p>Good luck!
