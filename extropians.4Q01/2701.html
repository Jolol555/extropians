<em>&gt; Vernant is great. He wrote with Marcel Detienne a book which, IMHO, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely interesting for people interested in transhumanism, about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goddess Metis (Metis ou Les ruses de l'intelligence). as you probably
</em><br>
know,
<br>
<em>&gt; Greek viewed knowledge as a very abstract thing, and discarded strongly
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; practical application; contrary to Romans, they despised technology. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Metis is a kind of &quot;underground&quot; goddess, associated with &quot;tekne&quot; and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of practical tricks, and, because of Greek repulsion toward this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspect of thought, appears as very ambiguous to them. Odysseus, for
</em><br>
instance
<br>
<em>&gt; is a &quot;metisian hero&quot;, but Odysseus, although being well-known, is much
</em><br>
less
<br>
<em>&gt; exemplary of the &quot;hero&quot; than Hercules or Achilles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, it would be interesting to see in Metis a &quot;Goddess&quot;,i.e. a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mythological role model, for philosophies involved in technology...
</em><br>
<p>I also like Vernant, especially his _Myth and Tragedy in Ancient Greece_ (a
<br>
collection of essays along with Pierre Vidal-Naquet).  While I might not
<br>
agree with every point they (him, Vidal-Naquet, and Detienne) make, they are
<br>
thought-provoking.
<br>
<p>Greek ambiguity as well as distaste for practical matters is more a
<br>
mainstream view -- and one with firm roots in the field long before Vernant
<br>
et al. came on the scene.  You also have to be aware of looking at the
<br>
Greeks through Modern eyes.  You can't step outside of this totally, but you
<br>
can be aware of it.
<br>
<p>For instance, with Odysseus, it may be true that he is different from many
<br>
other Greek heroes, BUT he is there nonetheless and in one of their most
<br>
celebrated and influential poems.  Therefore, I don't see him as less
<br>
examplary.  I see him, in fact, as a sort of break with earlier heroes.  The
<br>
Greeks were still mired in the old, too, but they also had this new type of
<br>
hero -- a hero of the mind.  (Notably, Odysseus' strong suit -- in terms of
<br>
character; it's obvious he was no whimp and also had some gods on his
<br>
side -- is his ability to think through just any situation.)  So, I don't
<br>
dismiss him from the pantheon of Greek heroes, though he's very different
<br>
from most of the rest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for Vernant teaching French politicians, I cannot tell you, but I seem
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; remember he had been involved politically in his youth (leftist), so
</em><br>
perhaps
<br>
<em>&gt; he continues to have some contacts...
</em><br>
<p>Well, that should be evident from some of his writings.  He comes off as a
<br>
Marxist scholar -- albeit not an unreconstructed, one-dimensional one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Jacqueline de Romilly is one of the most famous historian of Greece in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; France, but I don't know a lot about her (although I have probably one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her books on my shelves, but who knows...;)
</em><br>
<p>She certainly is (but she's also one of the leading lights of Ancient Greek
<br>
scholarship regardless of nation).  I'm not sure if I've ever read anything
<br>
by her, BUT, in almost every scholarly work on Ancient Greece I've read,
<br>
she's cited.  (For example, only yesterday, I finished reading Chester
<br>
Starr's 1989 book _The Influence of Seapower on Ancient History_, a book
<br>
that challenges Mahan's ideas of seapower in Ancient times.  That book had
<br>
several citations of her work.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
