</em><br>
<p>It's all a matter of mojo, John. With the twin spires of Hiroshima and
<br>
Nagasaki, the Japanese people finally realized that their high jefe, the
<br>
god on earth, Hirohito, just didn't have the mojo compared to those
<br>
Americans, so obviously the American Way was a better way to conquer the
<br>
world: economically, with generous helpings of photo-tourism and a
<br>
worshipful attitude to the American Past-Time of baseball.
<br>
<p>This is why I, like Spike, advocate the use of overwhelming force in
<br>
war: the enemy needs to KNOW, all the way down to his gonads, that his
<br>
way is utterly wrong and ours is utterly right before he will accept the
<br>
sort of surrender we need to ensure that we don't have to fight them all
<br>
over again a few decades later. In Kuwait, carpet bombing did the job
<br>
with the Republican Guard, then we went and gave up ourselves, not
<br>
realizing the sort of victory and peace we needed to actually impose.
<br>
Hussein was THIS close to personally feeling that lack of scrotal
<br>
fortitude that the rest of his men felt, but we didn't press the issue,
<br>
now we have to deal with THIS MESS, which is here because of that lack
<br>
of will on our part in 1991.
<br>
<p>Like surprise, defeat does not occur on the battlefield, it occurs in
<br>
the mind of the enemy. If you destroy his ability to fight, but do no
<br>
change his mind, you will have to fight him again some day, and you will
<br>
rue that day.
