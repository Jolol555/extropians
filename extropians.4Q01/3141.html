I think that if the United States had realized, that far back in 
<br>
time, how much the threat of nuclear war - and later, nanotechnological 
<br>
war and biological war - would hang over the heads of future generations, 
<br>
the correct decision would have been to spend the lives necessary 
<br>
to subdue Japan the hard way.  The US was the first to acquire nuclear 
<br>
weapons, and then immediately used them, in war, against a nonnuclear 
<br>
opponent's cities.  This is not a good precedent if some country 
<br>
other than the US is the first to acquire military nanotechnology. 
<br>
&nbsp;This does not help the US's argument for nuclear nonproliferation.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I have to disagree with you.  I think we still would have, considering 
<br>
the massive casualties projected to happen on either side.  A hundred-thousand 
<br>
U.S. casualties or more for the endgame just would not be tolerated 
<br>
when an atom bomb can be used.  So, unless a time traveler showed 
<br>
the President an end of the world result due to its usage, the bomb would have been dropped.
<br>
<p>I do agree it would have been the proper thing to demonstrate the 
<br>
destructive power of the atom bomb by first dropping one on a relatively 
<br>
uninhabited area.  But remember, by being so ruthless with Japan, 
<br>
we showed the Soviets we were NOT to be messed with.  Doing it your 
<br>
way would have shown us as weak where use of nukes were concerned. 
<br>
&nbsp;And the Soviet leadership had no respect for weakness.  
<br>
<p>In actuality, a limited or even total nuclear war may have been 
<br>
averted by the U.S. decision to be so brutal.  The Soviets after 
<br>
this realized playing &quot;Russian roulette&quot; with us would be a very 
<br>
high-stakes game.  The Berlin Blockade and the Cuban Missle Crisis are examples of this.    
<br>
<p>you continued:
<br>
I think it would have been worth subduing Japan the hard way in 
<br>
order to establish the principle that non-first-use of weapons of 
<br>
mass destruction, even when the lives of your country's soldiers 
<br>
are at stake or whatever, is an absolute, inviolable principle - 
<br>
that who wins or loses some war between nations isn't worth dragging 
<br>
existential risks (planetary risks) into the equation.  We blew 
<br>
our chance to establish that principle almost immediately.  It's depressing.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>And would the Soviets have respected our example? lol!  The problem 
<br>
of being &quot;noble&quot; in such a way is that often your unprincipled enemy 
<br>
will not be.  And they will be very tempted to think you will not 
<br>
have the backbone to defend yourself in a case of nuclear blackmail.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Don't tread on me!
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
