<p>The Geek Syndrome
<br>
What's behind the rise in Asperger's syndrome? It's in the genes, and techie parents may be passing it along.

<p>Think Different?
<br>
Inside the mind of autism researcher Simon Baron-Cohen.

<br>
<p>People with the capacity for great depth of interest, adapted for pathfinding at the edge of the known, are poor at elaborate low
<br>
risk/low gain social activity. This is because language and self are the most dense and complex areas of the interest system,
<br>
requiring maximum breadth of modelling. We postulate that self and language tasks as they are habitually performed may require more
<br>
breadth of arousal than is available in some interest systems. Many of the problems in relating to society experienced by people
<br>
described as autistic are the result of different modalities of language use and of the modelling of the self, other and the words
<br>
between.
<br>
<p>The other extreme of this normal distribution of types of mind consists of people with very broad but not very deep minds. This
<br>
category includes those most highly rewarded by society, chat show hosts and politicians. Such people do not posses outstanding
<br>
specific talents, but have great ability to model other people, giving them power to manipulate social, rather than actual,
<br>
situations.
<br>
<p>We cannot think of Autism as an illness for which a cure can be discovered [17]. We do however observe in people described as
<br>
Autistic a cast of mind that renders them unsuitable for conventional forms of employment. However, we see this economic frame of
<br>
reference as holding the key to a happy outcome. In benign circumstances, people with the capacity for deep concentration have a
<br>
great capacity to learn skills which are beyond the broad mind. Mass production culture may have deprived the deep minded of
<br>
occasion to contribute to society as the pathfinders to physical resources, but it has opened a vast spectrum of new opportunities.
<br>
<p>It is the deep mind that has the capacity to read, understand and apply the technical manual, to enter into the intricate labyrinth
<br>
of the logic of the integrated circuit and the computer program. It is the forager mind, insensitive to the way everybody knows
<br>
things should be done, which creates the paradigm transforming technologies. Appropriate education would enable many ingenious and
<br>
creative people to be part of things, who are now totally excluded from the mainstream of society. Education based on understanding
<br>
could transform this apparent problem into an opportunity.
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>Every population has a surface, however diffuse. This fact of topology firmly drives brain evolution. Autism in particular is
<br>
primarily the result of adaptation to the inevitable sparseness of population outer regions. This yields not only autism, but an
<br>
autism spectrum. It also gives rise to the great variety of autistic forms and genes. These conclusions sharply limit the possible
<br>
clarity of autism diagnosis and preclude any simplistic &quot;silver-bullet&quot; response to the rigors of autism. The theory accounts for
<br>
the observed correlation of autism and gender, and predicts a correlation with latitude of ancestral homeland. Autism emerges as a
<br>
major feature of brain evolution: It is generally not a disease. Autism has been with humans as long as humans have been and has
<br>
markedly influenced human history. It evidently has shaped forms of religious practice.
