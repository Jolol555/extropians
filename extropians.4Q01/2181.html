Study Finds Genetic Link Between Intelligence and Size of Some Regions of the
<br>
Brain
<br>
By NICHOLAS WADE
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/05/health/anatomy/05BRAI.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/05/health/anatomy/05BRAI.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;Plunging into the roiled waters of human intelligence and its heritability,
<br>
brain scientists say they have found that the size of certain regions of the
<br>
brain is under tight genetic control and that the larger these regions are the
<br>
higher is intelligence.
<br>
<p>The finding is true only on average and cannot be used to assess an
<br>
individual's intelligence, said Dr. Paul M. Thompson, the leader of the
<br>
research team and a pioneer in mapping the structure of the brain.
<br>
<p>The measurement of intelligence has long been a controversial issue, and even
<br>
more so the efforts to tease out the relative contributions of heredity and
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>Dr. Bruce L. Miller, a neurologist at the University of California at San
<br>
Francisco and an expert on brain changes in Alzheimer's disease, said Dr.
<br>
Thompson's work was &quot;an exciting study that starts to show there are some
<br>
brain areas in which there are very significant genetic influences on
<br>
structure.&quot;
<br>
<p>And Dr. Robert Plomin, a psychologist who studies intelligence at the
<br>
Institute of Psychiatry in London, said the high correlation found between the
<br>
size of certain areas of the brain and general intelligence &quot;does make it
<br>
harder to dismiss intelligence as some meaningless construct, as some want to
<br>
do.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Thompson, who is at the University of California at Los Angeles, uses a
<br>
type of brain scanning called magnetic resonance imaging, which can show the
<br>
difference between gray matter and white matter in the living brain. The gray
<br>
matter consists of brain cells, while the white matter comprises the bundles
<br>
of wiring with which the cells communicate with one another. The amount of
<br>
gray matter is a measure of the number of brain cells.
<br>
<p>The human brain seems to be divided into modules that perform separate tasks.
<br>
The frontal lobes are involved in planning and risk assessment, while regions
<br>
at the back of the brain handle visual processing. Dr. Thompson has tried to
<br>
discover if the relative size of the brain's modules is under genetic control
<br>
by studying how their size varies in twins.
<br>
<p>With the help of colleagues in Finland, where a national registry of twins is
<br>
maintained, he scanned the brains of identical and fraternal pairs of twins
<br>
and measured the size of the brain modules. Qualities that are under genetic
<br>
control show a characteristic pattern of varying hardly at all between
<br>
identical twins, who have the same genes; quite a lot between fraternal twins,
<br>
who share about half their genes; and a great deal between unrelated
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>The researchers had their computer draw three-dimensional maps of each
<br>
subject's brain, and then color coded the modules' degree of heritability. In
<br>
an article published in today's issue of Nature Neuroscience, they report that
<br>
the quantity of gray matter in the frontal lobes was under particularly tight
<br>
genetic control, as was a region at the side of the left hemisphere known as
<br>
Wernicke's area, which is central to language.
<br>
<p>Dr. Thompson's reason for probing the genetic control of brain structure was
<br>
to uncover genes that might be involved in mental diseases that can be
<br>
inherited, like schizophrenia and autism. But he and his colleagues also
<br>
wished to understand the role of brain modules in healthy individuals, so they
<br>
gave their subjects intelligence tests and found that intelligence was
<br>
significantly linked with the amount of gray matter in the subjects' frontal
<br>
lobes.
<br>
<p>Dr. Thompson said the findings were &quot;the first maps of the degree to which the
<br>
genes control brain structure.&quot; There were only 40 subjects in his study — 10
<br>
pairs of identical twins and 10 pairs of fraternal twins — but the results
<br>
gave &quot;enough statistical power to identify the key brain systems,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>He expressed surprise that the amount of gray matter in the frontal lobes
<br>
turned out to be correlated with intelligence in his study &quot;because you
<br>
wouldn't think something as simple as gray matter would affect something as
<br>
complicated as intelligence.&quot; But the amount of gray matter, which is related
<br>
to the number of brain cells, perhaps reflects something that bears more
<br>
directly on intelligence, like the number of cell- to-cell connections, he
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Dr. Plomin, who wrote a commentary on the study in the journal, said the
<br>
larger volume of gray matter could be the cause of higher intelligence, or it
<br>
could be the other way around — people with a stronger motivation, say, might
<br>
exercise their brains harder and develop a higher density of neurons.
<br>
<p>As brain-scanning studies like Dr. Thompson's become more refined, they raise
<br>
the possibility that a scan could be used to gauge various elements of
<br>
personality or behavior.
<br>
<p>Dr. Thompson said he believed that as brain scans become increasingly
<br>
informative they will raise issues of personal privacy just as genetic testing
<br>
has done, and should be protected with similar safeguards.
<br>
<p>The size of gray matter in the frontal lobes cannot be used to measure an
<br>
individual's intelligence, he said. Some potential uses, such as scanning to
<br>
compare the intelligence of different groups, would be unethical, he added.
<br>
&quot;It would be remiss to use technology developed for disease for those types of
<br>
goals,&quot; he said.
