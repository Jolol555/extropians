<p>### What is the ethical framework for your statement? It would appear that
<br>
the statement's source is the ethical system you personally espoused, yet
<br>
you formulate your sentence using the 1st person plural. Are you saying that
<br>
the ethical principles shared by us (Extropians?) forbid foreign
<br>
intervention? I would think that your point of view is not universally
<br>
shared, and therefore it is improper to express it as a categorical
<br>
injunction.

Force is force.  It would be meaningless for these things to be
imposed rather than coming from the people themselves.
<p>### In the ethical system I adhere to, protecting the innocent by force is
not only allowed, it is a duty for all moral agents. My opinion is in fact
quite common - we (most humans) are perfectly comfortable with imposing
goodness (e.g. stopping murderers from forming bands and terrorising the
countryside) by force (e.g. killing them).
<p>----
What is important is ending the current violence and creating to
the extent possible, starting from what is already present, an
environment that a more civil and healthy country may grow out
of.  What is most needful is to create a process for the
resolution of conflict that does not depend on violence and the
forceful imposition of religious or other dictates on the entire
population.
<p>### I am glad that when it comes to actual concrete plans you suggest the
same or similar actions that I or Brian Williams would recommend. Since
using force (however indirectly) is the only known method to prevent
violent, immoral people from acting in a violent, immoral way, your call for
&quot;a process for the resolution of conflict that does not depend on violence&quot;
is indeed an oblique endorsement of intervention of some sort (be it
occupation, UN peacekeeping, financial manipulations). Kudos for  you!
<p><p>  I don't know if there is space to fully get there
or how close it is possible to get.  What won't happen is that
Afghanistan will not become like a little US culturally or
politically any time soon.  I don't think it would be terribly
good if it did. 
<p>####  Inching closer to the US, for example, in the dimension of controlled
vs. uncontrolled use of force in disputes, would be IMHO quite good if it
happened. Are you seriously claiming the opposite?
