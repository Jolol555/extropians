Assume you are at a party where nerds gather and someone proposes
<br>
a tunnel drilled diametrically thru the earth, and asks you to assume
<br>
away all traces of an atmosphere and any asphericity of the earth.
<br>
<p>She asks if a particle dropped into the tunnel will arrive before or
<br>
after another particle in a treetop orbit, assuming the tunnelling particle
<br>
is dropped just as the orbiting particle goes by; that is will the particle
<br>
that falls thru the earth take more or less than 42 minutes.
<br>
<p>The other nerds know the answer is about 42 minutes.  They are
<br>
wrong of course, for you now know that the correct answer, which I
<br>
finally got off my lazy ass and calculated, is 37 minutes.  The reason
<br>
it takes less than  42 minutes is that the earth has a definite density
<br>
gradient, so that the core is much denser than the crust and mantle.
<br>
<p>If you wish to appear astute before the other nerds, you might go
<br>
on to observe that a particle thru the center can be arranged to
<br>
take longer or shorter than the minimal orbit particle, but in order
<br>
to make it take the same time, the sphere needs to be of uniform
<br>
density.  Once can arrange for the particle thru the center to take
<br>
longer than the orbitting particle by having a hollow sphere for
<br>
instance.
<br>
<p>Regarding Damien Broderick's train on a straight frictionless track
<br>
on a non-diametric chord thru the earth, the train will arrive at its
<br>
destination, regardless of where, in slightly less than 42 minutes.  spike
