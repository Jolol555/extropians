<em>&gt; In a war, ALL information about a) the enemy, and b) your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities, operations, methods, and assets, is to be regarded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence information. You may choose to release some of that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; its utility in the propaganda war versus the cost of letting the enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that information, as they would once it is publicly published.
</em><br>
<p>Great.  So we should all close down our websites because they
<br>
potentially give our &quot;enemy&quot; information?  How about this list? 
<br>
What of the public's right and need to know what the hell is
<br>
going on in a democracy?  Mere collateral damage?  Really, you
<br>
are taking your point to ridiculous lengths simply, imho, to not
<br>
have to admit any possible weakness in your position.  This is a
<br>
pattern I've seen in many of your posts.  It bothers me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, for example, it is detailed at trial what methods were used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover evidence about the planning, preparation, logistics, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operations of terrorist attacks, the public record of this evidence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then available for the al Qaeda or any other terrorist network to use to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out ways to avoid evidentiary discovery in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What about the right of the accused to know what they are
<br>
accused of and to examine and defend against the evidence and
<br>
testimony against them?  Couldn't you say the same about any and
<br>
all criminal trials perhaps giving evidence to other criminals
<br>
or criminal organizations?  And then where would our rights be?
<br>
<p>Terrorism, and the fight against it, does not justify ripping
<br>
rights to shreds.  We are not that scared.  I am far more scared
<br>
of the loss of rights than of terrorist perhaps drawing some
<br>
benefit from the practice of actual justice rather than kangaroo
<br>
courts in this country.
