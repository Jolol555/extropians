<br>
during the last decade the Japanese have been really lousy businessmen, they 
<br>
tried to protect every industry regardless of how much money it lost and they 
<br>
tried to run everything centrally. In fact their accounting practices are so 
<br>
crummy in their largest corporations they don't know what parts of the 
<br>
company make money and what divisions don't
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they kind of remind me of the old practices referred to in 
<br>
Economics as &quot;beggar my neighbor.&quot;  Just because they aren't very good at 
<br>
being successful for themselves doesn't mean that we have to stand still and 
<br>
let them beggar us also.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the way things might sound here I am all for free trade.  But, 
<br>
allowing everyone on the globe to trade freely in our country while being 
<br>
barred out of their countries is not free trade.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I want to create an impression that I think our politicians are 
<br>
very good at encouraging trade either inside or outside the country.  I get 
<br>
the impression that American business when it succeeds succeed despite our 
<br>
policies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, as one fellow had the impression that Japanese cars were superior 
<br>
to ours,  My personal impression is that their superiority exists mostly in 
<br>
the minds of their marketing departments and a few Americans that they have 
<br>
managed to impress.
