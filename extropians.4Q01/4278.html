As this stn2 video reports, some unusually long-living mice may have the
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>Extending healthspan
<br>
Scientists have known since the 1930s that they can extend lifespan in
<br>
laboratory mice and rats by restricting the animals' diets. More recent
<br>
studies
<br>
have proven that caloric restriction also prolongs life in fruit flies,
<br>
nematode worms, yeast and nonhuman primates. The goal of all this research, of
<br>
course, is to learn how to increase human longevity.
<br>
<p>&quot;When we're talking about delayed aging we are not talking about creating an
<br>
increasing number of, you know, individuals with age-related problems, but we
<br>
are talking about prevention of age-related problems,&quot; says Andrzej Bartke,
<br>
professor and chair of physiology at Southern Illinois University School of
<br>
Medicine. In a word, Bartke says, he wants to learn how to prolong
<br>
&quot;healthspan.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bartke's group wanted to know why Ames dwarf mice, whose dwarfism is caused by
<br>
a mutation in just one gene, also live longer than their normal siblings. Both
<br>
caloric restriction and the dwarfism mutation increased the prolonged
<br>
healthspan in mice from an average of two years to an average of three, Bartke
<br>
says. &quot;If you put it in terms of human life, if the average lifespan in the
<br>
human in industrial society is somewhere around 75, an increase of 50 percent
<br>
would bring you to somewhere around 110 to 115.&quot;

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
