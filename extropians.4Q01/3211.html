Daniel's comments triggered some thoughts --
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mean the trend to look not toward a lasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peace after the war, but merely to fighting ferociously during the war,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often obliterating the other society to the point that it creates a power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vacuum.  This did happen in both World Wars. [snip] Wars, instead, could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be fought in a limited fashion with the limited aims, the goal being to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the peace after a war better than that before.  Destroying Germany
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in WW2 did not do this.  It lead to 40 years of costly and nearly fatal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict with the USSR.
</em><br>
<p>It is interesting to contrast the response by the Western allies to
<br>
creating a &quot;peace&quot; in Germany vs. Japan.
<br>
<p>With Germany the response seems to have been -- what we did the
<br>
first time (after WWI) didn't work -- so lets do it differently
<br>
this time (a 4-part Germany -- parts of which were rebuilt
<br>
in significantly different images -- democratic vs. communist).
<br>
In contrast, the U.S. seems to have attempted to rebuild Japan
<br>
in essentially its own image.  One might argue that the Japanese
<br>
Keiretsu vertical monopolies have put a significant Japanese &quot;spin&quot;
<br>
on that effort, but it largely seems successful.
<br>
<p>Now, it seems unlikely that any of these approaches will work
<br>
in Afghanistan where things seem for the most part to be based
<br>
on feudal tribal warlord fiefdoms.
<br>
<p>I disagree with Daniel that destroying Germany (or Japan) did not
<br>
have the result of creating a &quot;better&quot; peace.  Germany and Japan
<br>
today are two of the least combative nations (from a military
<br>
perspective).  It is presumably very difficult to predict whether
<br>
the elimination of a lesser foe is likely to bring two stronger
<br>
foes into greater conflict with one another.  Given the differences
<br>
in political systems, the U.S./USSR conflict seems to have been probable
<br>
whether or not Germany or Japan had ever been participants in WWII.
<br>
Potential conflicts between &quot;secular&quot; and &quot;fundamentalist&quot; governments
<br>
around the world today might provide interesting comparisons to
<br>
the U.S./USSR differences of the cold war era.
<br>
<p>However, the real point I want to raise is the *difficulty*
<br>
of creating reliable international relations.  Unlike the
<br>
trust relations one has with individuals -- where one builds
<br>
the trust over time, where one can look the individual in
<br>
the face to see if perhaps they might be lying, where one
<br>
can study an individual's behavior to see if they are working
<br>
against you -- doing that with a &quot;state entity&quot; is rather
<br>
difficult.  You cannot look them in the face, there may be
<br>
some elements working for your interests and other elements
<br>
working against your interests, etc.
<br>
<p>We do not have mechanisms built into our genetic/meme-sets
<br>
to allow us to judge international trust relationships with
<br>
any relative degree of confidence.  We are making these up
<br>
as we go along (having only a few hundred years of history
<br>
to draw on).  Trust relationships are further complicated in
<br>
democratic societies by the shifting of the trust representatives
<br>
on the chess board (Clinton-Yeltsin, Bush-Putin, etc.).
<br>
Doesn't it strike anyone as *shocking* that the U.S. and
<br>
Britain who fought two wars against each other are now
<br>
the closest of allies?!?
<br>
<p>One can consider that during the most recent ~300-400 (perhaps as much
<br>
as ~2200) years of human history (before ~1900) the &quot;dominant&quot;
<br>
international relations paradigm was &quot;take whatever you can get
<br>
*and* hold&quot;.  Only in the last century or so has it become apparent
<br>
that that strategy is problematic.
<br>
<p>I do not have recomendations for how one can migrate international
<br>
relationships up to the level of trustability we seem to be able
<br>
to obtain in interpersonal relationships.  (And as recent list
<br>
conversations show -- even interpersonal relationships among
<br>
those whose global perspectives are presumably similar may
<br>
be quite problematic.)  I do think however that we *must* seek
<br>
goals regarding the modification of individuals within populations
<br>
or modifications of the ways populations communicate with each other
<br>
that promote a greater understanding of each others perspectives.
<br>
The current system of propagating trust up to higher levels (and
<br>
delgating it to individuals who may be corruptable) seems to me
<br>
to be a very fragile architecture.
