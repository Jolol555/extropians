try it

(which

foreign
<br>

In
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recent briefings you have become despondent over the intractable nature

of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the conflict between the Enlightenment cultural values you hold as a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political and social force throughout that region.  You want to propose
</em><br>
some
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Question: What would you propose?
</em><br>
<p>### Do nothing that isn't being done anyway.
<br>
<p>Keep up the R&amp;D on all kinds of energy sources, as determined by
<br>
peer-reviewed funding agencies.
<br>
<p>Continue domestic oil exploration.
<br>
<p>Tax only to get cash but not to shape consumer preferences (unfortunately,
<br>
this kind of taxation is being used frequently). Under no circumstances
<br>
allow import duties to distort economic reality.
<br>
<p>Once the oil wells dry out on their own, or else political instability in
<br>
the Middle East becomes too difficult to manage, forcing oil prices up, the
<br>
R&amp;D results will allow the market to provide all the energy needed, at the
<br>
then possible price. For politicians to try to outguess a peer-reviewed
<br>
basic science process and force a pet solution (fuel cells, nuclear) before
<br>
its time is like doing a craniotomy without a CT scan for a neurosurgeon -
<br>
almost always a bad idea.
<br>
<p>My private guess is that alternative ways of making gas (from natural gas,
<br>
coal, maybe even from hydrogen from renewable sources) will be the answer,
<br>
rather than trying to tame hydrogen itself in cars (barring unpredictable
<br>
and almost miraculous drop in fuel cell prices). Germans and South Africans
<br>
were quite successful at synfuel production and it won't take a huge
<br>
increase in oil prices to make this technology attractive again. And, last
<br>
but not least, wind technology could become very important.
