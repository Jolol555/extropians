<p>&lt;&lt;Solar cell edges towards endless energy
<br>
<p>&nbsp;7 December 2001 
<br>
<p>A limitless source of clean-burning fuel is a step closer following the 
<br>
discovery of a material that can extract hydrogen from water using energy 
<br>
from visible light. Zhigang Zou of the National Institute of Advanced 
<br>
Industrial Science and Technology in Japan and colleagues have developed a 
<br>
photocatalyst that uses optical radiation – which makes up 43% of solar 
<br>
energy. A reliable source of hydrogen is one of the ‘holy grails’ of energy 
<br>
production – hydrogen releases lots of energy when it burns and the only 
<br>
by-product is water. Previous catalysts have only responded to ultraviolet 
<br>
radiation, which accounts for just 4% of the Sun’s energy (Z Zou et al 2001 
<br>
Nature 414 625).
<br>
<p>Photocatalysis is the use of energy from absorbed light to initiate chemical 
<br>
reactions. Semiconductors are useful in such reactions because they can be 
<br>
designed so that their electronic characteristics change when they absorb 
<br>
radiation. But their energy bandgaps are often large, and this means that 
<br>
only photons with short-wavelengths and high-energies – such as ultraviolet 
<br>
photons – can promote electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. 
<br>
To create a suitable material, Zou and co-workers added nickel to the 
<br>
semiconductor indium tantalum oxide. This reduced its energy bandgap from 2.6 
<br>
to 2.3 electronvolts, which means that visible photons carry enough energy to 
<br>
make electrons jump the bandgap. They immersed this semiconductor in water 
<br>
and illuminated it with an arc lamp. As the semiconductor absorbs energy from 
<br>
the photons, electrons jump from the valence band to the conduction band, 
<br>
leaving positive holes in the valence band. Provided the conduction band is 
<br>
at a higher energy than the ‘reduction potential’ of hydrogen, the ‘promoted’
<br>
&nbsp;electrons drift to the surface of the semiconductor where they combine with 
<br>
hydrogen ions in the water to make hydrogen gas. To balance this reaction, 
<br>
the valence band must be at a lower energy than the ‘oxidation potential’ of 
<br>
oxygen – this allows the positive holes to surface and accept electrons from 
<br>
oxygen ions in the water, creating oxygen gas. The new semiconductor is also 
<br>
resilient – existing semiconductors that use visible light either corrode or 
<br>
become inert when they come into contact with water. Zou and colleagues point 
<br>
out that although their set-up is only 0.66% efficient, they are confident 
<br>
that this will improve when they increase the surface area of the 
<br>
semiconductor, and adjust its layout.&gt;&gt;
