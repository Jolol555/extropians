As I viewed downtown Manhattan from the air this week,
<br>
I pondered the terrorist threat of an internet worm designed
<br>
to crash the whole net, bringing down email, everything.  Heres
<br>
a thought experiment for you:
<br>
<p>How many classes of people can you think of that would
<br>
take down the internet if they had the ability to do so?
<br>
<p>Assuming the deed can be done by one person, who
<br>
only needs to make the decision to unleash the net-killing
<br>
worm or not, with no possibility of ever being caught or
<br>
found out or blamed in any way.  An example scenario
<br>
is a person walks in on a mad scientist who has developed
<br>
the worm and the screen on the CRT offers to launch the
<br>
worm by hitting return, or killing the worm by hitting any
<br>
key.  {I can never find the &quot;any&quot; key.}  What classes of
<br>
people would choose to launch the worm?
<br>
<p>1.  Taliban
<br>
2.  Luddites
<br>
<p>Ok, those were easy.  Any others?  How about:
<br>
<p>3.  Car dealers?  They have a much harder time with
<br>
their negotiations these days since their customers have
<br>
much greater control over information than before.
<br>
<p>4.  Ministers?  Their clientele can find dirt on the
<br>
church much more readily than ever, as well as
<br>
access porn, etc.
<br>
<p>5.  Anyone whose business competitors use the net
<br>
more or more effectively?
<br>
<p>6.  Spouses whose SO spends far more time on
<br>
the computer than they should?
<br>
<p>7.  Parents of young children?
<br>
<p>8.  People from countries where the net hasn't
<br>
penetrated?
<br>
<p>9.  Pretty much anyone who doesnt ever use the net?
<br>
<p>What percentage of people would be worm launchers?
<br>
It occurred to me that if you add up all the classes of
<br>
those who would take down the net, it might be over
<br>
half of humanity, perhaps way over half.  spike
