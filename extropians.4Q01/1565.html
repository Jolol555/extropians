<p>To the Cc'd recipients-- I apologize for adding to your doubtless
<br>
already large inboxes. I'm beginning to see parallels between this
<br>
issue and the ideas we explored earlier, and if any issue today needs
<br>
brains like yours probing it, it's this one.

</em><br>
<p>1. This is criticized as a contradictory stance-- not only a
<br>
relinquishment of tolerance and relativism, but a selective
<br>
relinquishment. In order to maintain this strategy, it is shielded
<br>
from public debate and scrutiny. The resulting lack of accountability
<br>
allows instruments of the open society's foreign policy to lose sight
<br>
of their original goals and even act in opposition to them. Witness
<br>
the US backing Islamofascism supposedly as a countermeasure to
<br>
Communism and now scrambling to back secular fascism as a
<br>
countermeasure to Islamofascism.
<br>
<p>1a. Furthermore, when an ends-justify-means calculus is employed, you
<br>
end up with the problem of entrusting somebody with the priviledged
<br>
position of deciding which ends justify which which means. Your
<br>
friendly AI might do it Eliezer, but even the best intentioned humans
<br>
inevitably lapse into &quot;MY ends justify the means&quot;.
<br>
<p>2. This contradiction may percolate backwards as the relinquishment
<br>
becomes less and less selective, ending in an intolerant and
<br>
absolutist society.
<br>
<p>3. Superior technology and economy does not necesserily trump a
<br>
superior strategic position. Witness American Revolution, siege of
<br>
Stalingrad, Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, Vietnam War, Chechnya, and
<br>
of course our current war against a delocalized enemy with wide
<br>
popular support.
<br>
<p><p>Other strategies....
<br>
<p>A. &quot;Lifestyle as propoganda&quot;, i.e porno, porkrinds, and pilsner. I
<br>
think with time this would work on anybody, but some memesets are more
<br>
resistant than others, and in some cases may be capable of spreading
<br>
and causing damage faster than they are neutralized. It's an open
<br>
question whose side time is on. Furthermore, though not necesserily
<br>
physically violent, it is destructive. It makes aggregate human
<br>
culture less complex/information-rich, which is one of the reasons
<br>
tolerance is adaptive in the first place.
<br>
<p>B. Isolationism. Do not depend on anybody else's resources, do not let
<br>
anybody in. Perhaps freely import/export information, but nothing
<br>
physical. Build massive Marginot lines along all coasts and borders,
<br>
and a missile defense shield on top (insofar as one is feasible). Be
<br>
free *internally* and sit tight, waiting for the rest of the world to
<br>
grow up. Probably too many things wrong with this strategy to count.
<br>
<p>Looking for better strategies.
<br>
<p>This reminds me of those sims that fuse Prisoner's Dilemma and
<br>
cellular automata so you have neighborhoods of cooperators and
<br>
defectors forming and reforming. Defectors can never be completely
<br>
wiped out, because as long as they are surrounded by cooperators
<br>
they'll thrive at their expense. However, they can never prevail,
<br>
because a neighborhood composed only of defectors will starve and
<br>
enterprising cooperators move in and recolonize it.
