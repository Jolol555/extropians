From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20The%20Friendly%20Skies%20meets%20&quot;Schedule%20Suntan&quot;,%20Fwd:%20Nekkid%20Air&In-Reply-To=&lt;027401c18f4d$78ec7260$3f5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; When we normally talk about prejudices, we do not refer to prior estimates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but rather to the tendency of not updating estimates - especially about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people. This is an irrational strategy, and in itself a reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust prejudiced people less (since their actions have a persistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational component and are not based on correct estimates of the state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world).
</em><br>
<p>Whether or not a rational person trusts a prejudiced person will depend more
<br>
on the intentions of the prejudiced person than on the prejudice itself,
<br>
because a non-prejudiced person who wants to harm you is less worthy of your
<br>
trust than a prejudiced person who wants to help you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which may actually be a good thing, since it is not a reliable predictor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust anyway (ask any conman). In fact, it might be worth examining what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust predictors people commonly use that are *not* valid and see if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be made valid or be recognized as invalid. Better trust signals can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make our society more trusting.
</em><br>
<p>One of the most common trust predictors that turn out to be false is the
<br>
religious set of signals. I've found it wise to never trust self-proclaimed
<br>
religious people, despite their dependence on public trust, because unless you
<br>
can be sure that they believe you are one of them, they may view you as an
<br>
enemy at any moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A better solution is to have a web rather than a chain. A web is stronger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than its weakest link.
</em><br>
<p>Better than a web is a network... preferably one that is self-organizing and
<br>
decentralized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A problem of current attempts to find infiltrators is that they will attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-infiltrators too from time to time. While some such errors are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unavoidable and acceptable, there is a risk that pervasive infiltrator-hunts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undermine trust more than they protect them. Suspicion does not breed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidence.
</em><br>
<p>Some quips from _Out of Control_:
<br>
A network nurtures small failures in order that large failures don't happen as
<br>
often.
<br>
The only organization capable of unprejudiced growth, or unguided learning, is
<br>
a network.
<br>
A system is anything that talks to itself.
<br>
One can imagine the future shape of companies by stretching them until they
<br>
are pure network. It will be hard at times to tell who is working for whom.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
