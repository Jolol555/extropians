<p>That's why I don't include citizens. Non-citizens are distinctly
<br>
different from citizens, they only have rights as a matter of courtesy
<br>
via diplomatic treaty, and our citizens get treated in a similarly poor
<br>
fashion in most other countries.
<br>
<p>I'm perfectly willing to drop the requirement with citizens from high
<br>
trust countries that reciprocate, unless those countries have open door
<br>
policies to immigration themselves (my main beef with Canada). Canada
<br>
has this chip on its shoulder that it has to prove its NOT the US so
<br>
badly that they endanger us all. A judge in British Columbia just
<br>
released a suspected terrorist (on his own recognizance, no less) that
<br>
was wanted for extradition to the US on the basis that the US had not
<br>
been able to present it's evidence yet (we are a bit busy here at the
<br>
moment it seems). Wanna place bets on that guy showing up again?
