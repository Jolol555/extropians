<em>&gt; In my own locality of King County, Washington, voters defeated an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Affirmative Action bill not too long ago.  Do I think that was racist?  Yes.
</em><br>
<p>Well, at least you got that right... &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; is definitely
<br>
racist, and sexist to boot.
<br>
IMO, it's almost as racist as the so-called &quot;reparations&quot; scheme advanced by
<br>
certain anti-white bigots.

&lt;&lt;BTW, can you give valid historical evidence of the beneficial effects of the
<br>
absence of a government on social development (I mean *total* absence of a
<br>
government resulting in great improvements in quality and quantity of human
<br>
life)?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Of course there is no such evidence. Nor is there evidence of the beneficial
<br>
effects of the *total* absence of disease, because disease is always present
<br>
in some form. Likewise, government is always present in some form. But we can
<br>
still try to get rid of it.

<em>&gt; Something more to consider:  women are more apt to be given breaks than men,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it comes to crime and prison sentences.  Generally speaking, to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure, but &quot;explanations&quot; for why women turn to crime are considered more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often than for men (i.e., the assumption being that if women do wrong it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be because they're victims of something or other, while men - because,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all, they're men&quot; - are responsible for their crimes, period).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's true. For example, notice all the analyses about why Susan Smith
<br>
murdered her children, and yet a man who murdered his children was recently
<br>
executed for this same crime.
<br>
&quot;If it turns out Susan Smith murdered her children simply
<br>
in order to advance an affair, are we wrong to condemn her?&quot;
<br>
asks one journal www.nodogs.org/2003.html
<br>
Imagine asking that kind of question about a man who murdered his children.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Here's the first and last law of zenarchy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any sufficiently hyper-cognitive complex adaptive system abandons all
</em><br>
desire&gt;&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do You have any evidence of this contention, from a peer-reviewed study?
</em><br>
<p>Well, there's the Dhammapada, allegedly authored by Siddhartha Gautama.
<br>
There are many reviews, but since he was rather peerless, those reviews don't
<br>
matter much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If ETI's existed, and were able to make themselves known to us, then
</em><br>
religion
<br>
<em>&gt; would certainly change, and I guess that one of Shermer's points was that
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; space aliens might become the deity or actually be the deity.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think religion would change nearly as much as science would change.
<br>
Religion is ready to incorporate UFOs into its belief system. Just alter or
<br>
modify some of the symbolism and mythology to fit the extraterrestrial, and
<br>
presto! ...aliens become angels.
<br>
<p>But for science to recognize and acknowledge ETIs would require a drastic and
<br>
shattering transformation ...and one which I personally do not expect to
<br>
happen, because currently, science is the closest thing we have to a machine
<br>
that can accurately identify incorrect thinking.

<br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, I think free markets moderated by government regulation is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea behind most government policies of the Western world. And I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this idea is very good. Of course implementing it is much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult than describing its basic philosophy and perhaps in actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation so far we have either lost too much of the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free markets, or not protected the weakest groups enough.
</em><br>
<p>Then again, it is the best system going.
<br>
The old saw, &quot;If it ain't broke don't fix it&quot; seems apropos here, because
<br>
although we may wish to improve the system, we should also recognize that
<br>
continued improvement is in fact one of the elements that explains why the
<br>
Western system works so well. We keep fine tuning our economic machine, while
<br>
others try to re-invent the wheel.

<em>&gt; I'm truly amazed to see such nonsense on the Extropian list.
</em><br>
<p>I'll give you the benefit of the doubt in this instance, and assume that your
<br>
rude comment was intended as an insult (albeit a lame one), since it's not
<br>
likely that you're so mentally challenged that you're actually &quot;truly amazed&quot;
<br>
by nonsense of any kind on the extropians list. Consequently, since your
<br>
intent was to insult rather than to inform, there's no point in responding
<br>
further.

DARWIN'S GHOST: Sociobiology and Human Behavior
<br>
<p>What can evolutionary science tell us about human behavior? During
<br>
the past thirty years, biologists, anthropologists, and psychologists
<br>
have begun applying Darwinian concepts, such as natural selection and
<br>
survival of the fittest, to the study of behavior. Are social
<br>
characteristics, such as aggression, love, and courtship, determined
<br>
by our evolutionary past and encoded into our genes like physical
<br>
attributes, such as walking upright or hair color? Are we slaves to
<br>
our DNA, or does genetic determinism fail to explain fully what it
<br>
means to be human? Guests: Paul Ehrlich, Bing Professor of Population
<br>
Studies, Stanford University; Author, Human Natures. Jeffrey Schloss,
<br>
Chair of the Biology Department, Westmont College; Author, Altruism
<br>
and Altruistic Love. Lionel Tiger, Charles Darwin Professor of
<br>
Anthropology, Rutgers University; Author, The Decline of Males
