<em>&gt; ...while local employers prefer to outsource the sort of work I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Indian job shops...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;But racist jibes are old.  This is a free country, and I'm 110% behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;people using free speech to express themselves.  But racist jibes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Olga, where is the racist jibe? I don't see one. ... He didn't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *complain*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the situation. He simply gave his view of why he lost his job,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plausibly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I took the very fact that Mike posted what he did into consideration.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past he has referred to various cultures in South America and Mexico as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kleptocracies, 
</em><br>
<p>Do you dispute that latin american governments are some of the most
<br>
corrupt in the world, who skim aid funds directed at their country into
<br>
their personal use, in spite of all the evidence? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and if I remember correctly - was one of the people who saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing racist in that lovely article that someone posted by Fred Reed.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (please oh please oh please) we don't need to rehash the Reed screed.
</em><br>
<p>I did not dispute many of the facts he stated, but did dispute some of
<br>
his conclusions and logic (just as I dispute your logic). If Reed said
<br>
the sky was blue and I agreed, would that make me a racist?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may in fact be Mike's opinion that he is being displaced by &quot;Indian job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shops.&quot;  I'm not exactly sure what that is, and I am assuming he didn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Indians&quot; from a  particular Indus Valley civilization, but our own native
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind, yes?
</em><br>
<p>No. Indian as in India. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Mike had said:  &quot;...while local employers prefer to outsource the sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work I do to Jews ...&quot; would that that have been racist?  I think so.  Of if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he had said &quot;...while local employers prefer to outsource the sort of work I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do to blacks...&quot; would that have been racist?  I think so.
</em><br>
<p>If I had said &quot;while local employers prefer to outsource the sort of
<br>
work I do to Israeli based firms...&quot; would you consider that racist or
<br>
merely a statement of fact? I made absolutely no qualitative remarks
<br>
about Indian job shops, whether they are superior or inferior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my own locality of King County, Washington, voters defeated an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Affirmative Action bill not too long ago.  Do I think that was racist?  Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While some people think Affirmative Action itself is &quot;racist&quot; (even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the group of people who've benefited the most from Affirmative Action in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past, I believe, have been &quot;white&quot; women) I think it balances things out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better (and much faster) than if humans were left to root out for the milk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human kindness on their own.
</em><br>
<p>So you say that you support affirmative action, despite the fact that
<br>
the people who have benefitted the most, women, are actually the
<br>
majority of the population, to the detriment of the male minority? Isn't
<br>
that rather bigoted of you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While Mike may not have been complaining directly, it seemed as if he were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing a kind of &quot;blame game&quot; with racist overtones, at the very least.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are reading my posts with excrement-colored glasses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He simply gave his view of why he lost his job, fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plausibly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I've simply given my view of how what Mike said came across to me.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have nothing against Mike personally.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously not, obviously. While I don't care how you think of me, it
<br>
does bother me that a person such as yourself could make such
<br>
unsubstantiated leaps of illogic, prejudice, and admit to her own bias
<br>
for the majority against the minority, yet somehow be offended when you
<br>
conclude, more due to your own prejudices than anything I actually
<br>
wrote, that I am somehow racist. That such people continue to populate a
<br>
list allegedly devoted to rationality and logic speaks volumes for the
<br>
degree of verbal strife that continues here.
<br>
<p>I also find it rather disengenuous that you a) consider me a racist,
<br>
despite a lack of my actually demonstrating same, and b) are not
<br>
personally offended by such a conclusion. If you so readily jump to such
<br>
a conclusion on a total lack of real evidence, it is obvious that you
<br>
are looking for something to be offended by. The least you can do is
<br>
admit it.
