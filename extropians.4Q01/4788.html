</em><br>
<p>Does this account for using the waste heat of one's nanomachinery in a
<br>
cogeneration mode, to supply the heating/cooling needed for one's own
<br>
habitat? Just how much nanomachinery would one individual actually need? 
<br>
<p>What about the fact that the use of nanomachinery only speeds up the use
<br>
of energy into a smaller time span than occurs in nature, which is
<br>
completely separate from the issue of how much the individual uses their
<br>
nanomachinery? For example, today I build my house of wood that is grown
<br>
by trees over a 20 year period from solar energy at an efficiency of a
<br>
few percent. Tomorrow I instead pour 10 kg of nanomachinery on the
<br>
ground, which over the course of several weeks builds my house for me
<br>
from the same soil, air, and sunlight that a tree would have used if I
<br>
had planted one there instead. A wood house requires tens of thousands
<br>
of board feet of wood, equalling a number of trees covering a much
<br>
larger area than that occupied by the house.
<br>
<p>The nanomachinery would not only feed off of sunlight for energy, it
<br>
would exploit the organic bonds of many different compounds in the soil
<br>
to power the conversion of that matter into construction materials.
<br>
Those organic bonds would otherwise have naturally released their energy
<br>
into the environment anyway through natural processes, so that energy
<br>
released is not &quot;new&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Once we have
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; releasing uncontrolled self-replicators.  So limiting the on-planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy consumption gives you much longer lead times with regard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to terrorists releasing self-replicating agents.
</em><br>
<p>I think the inaccurate assumption is that off-planet power sources are
<br>
simply going to be added to current power sources, rather than supplant
<br>
them. While it is safe to assume that power demand will rise over time,
<br>
it is also safe to say that as beamed power becomes more competetive
<br>
than fossil or other sources, it will supplant such sources in the
<br>
market, and fossil fuels will fall out of use, just as the use of
<br>
'producer gas' from steam treating coal in many cities fell out of use
<br>
early in the 20th century when it became non-competetive.
<br>
<p>If beamed power supplants fossil fuel use, then there will be no net
<br>
increase in heat added to our climate.
