Yet another indication of the biological basis of morality, in further support
<br>
of Dawkins and objective morality.

THE seat of temperance has been located by experiments on men watching X-rated
<br>
films, revealing a region in the front of the brain that can control our most
<br>
primitive sexual urges.
<br>
<p>Researchers at the University of Montreal in Canada discovered the areas of
<br>
the brain that play this inhibitory role by asking a dozen men to watch clips
<br>
of erotic movies and films that were sexually neutral.
<br>
<p>In the Journal of Neuroscience, Mario Beauregard, Johanne Levesque and Pierre
<br>
Bourgouin report that when the men gave free rein to sexual arousal there was
<br>
activation of a brain centre called the limbic system, or &quot;emotional brain&quot;.
<br>
<p>The men were then asked to become &quot;detached observers&quot; and do whatever it took
<br>
to avoid arousal as their brains were scanned by a technique called magnetic
<br>
resonance imaging. The scanner showed that parts of the brain called the
<br>
prefrontal cortex were activated as the men showed restraint.
<br>
<p>The prefrontal lobe is the most recent part of the nervous system to develop
<br>
in evolution. Chimpanzees have one, but it is no more than 25 per cent the
<br>
size of the organ in humans.
<br>
<p>Thus temperance, the control of sexual excitation, is controlled by an organ
<br>
that is unique to primates and highly developed in humans.
<br>
<p>The ability to &quot;turn off&quot; an emotion has wider implications, being central to
<br>
warding off disorders such as depression and anxiety, which are marked by
<br>
patients' inability to turn their thoughts from sadness and worry.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
