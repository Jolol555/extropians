<br>
<em>&gt; It is difficult for libertarians to tell people 10 years after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Fall of Communism&quot; why those people's (in former communist countries)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives are not significantly better now.
</em><br>
<p>Since it took communism 70 years to mess up their country, we shouldn't expect
<br>
to remedy the situation in only ten.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For me personally it's sad,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since I was one of those who used to tell people that as soon as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communists disappeared, and free market mechanisms took hold, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their economic lives would be much better...
</em><br>
<p>If their economic lives could have begun with a clean slate, instead of
<br>
undoing several decades of the murderous antics of one Josef Stalin, then
<br>
perhaps free market mechanisms could take hold to better effect. Perhaps it's
<br>
difficult for entrepreneurs to get used to the idea that their lives are not
<br>
in danger for thinking capitalistic thoughts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mark has convinced me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now that this book can explain some important reasons why those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's lives are not signficantly better, as well as what can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done to change that situation. It certainly is a cause to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passionate about!
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a good place to start would be to get rid of the Russian Mafia, which
<br>
is where the KGB has apparently migrated?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, I haven't read this book yet, but it's been on my reading list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in-queue since Mark spent some time talking about it with me in June,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'm looking forward to it.
</em><br>
<p>Which costs more... Mark's book or Das Kapital?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, we need to get Mark Miller and Hernando De Soto together. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have not met each other yet.
</em><br>
<p>What a beautifully friendly gesture that would be!
<br>
Maybe they should meet in Hernando's Hideaway...
<br>
Ole!

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
