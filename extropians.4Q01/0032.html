Bryan Moss dissed the link Jeff Davis provided on the effects
<br>
of &quot;prayer&quot; on in vitro fertilization success rates asking:
<br>
<em>&gt; Um. Then why would they do it?
</em><br>
<p>For the simple reason that it is an extension regarding
<br>
studies of the placebo effect.  I can easily see a
<br>
perspective where &quot;prayer&quot; could substitute for a
<br>
placebo, particularly in situations where the individuals
<br>
involved might have a greater faith in their &quot;god&quot; than
<br>
in their physician which seems likely to be the case with in
<br>
vitro fertilization where the success rates are low.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, in vitro fertilization is hardly an unstressful
<br>
procedure.  Stress is known to shunt resources such as glucose
<br>
away from non-essential body systems (e.g. the reproductive
<br>
tract, the immune system, etc.) to make them available for the
<br>
fight-or-flight response (See books by Robert Sapolsky).  So
<br>
if prayer serves to alleviate stress by taking the success
<br>
of the procedure out of your hands (i.e. it will turn out
<br>
according to &quot;God's will&quot; and you have no &quot;real&quot; control over
<br>
the situation), then stress levels are likely to be lower
<br>
and more resources may be available to allow successful
<br>
attachment and growth of the embryo.
<br>
<p>No nitwit many-worlds explanation required -- simple applied
<br>
endocrinology and physiology.
<br>
