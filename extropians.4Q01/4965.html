From: &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20A%20response%20to%20Rafal%20Smigrodzki,%20Part%201&In-Reply-To=&lt;EB5DDEEFC7B4D411AD3B00508BDFF3E20231913F@1upmc-msx7.isdip.upmc.edu&gt;">neptune@mars.superlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;The title suggests that this would only
<br>
happen under democracy.  I submit -- in agreement with Hoppe -- it
<br>
happens under all forms of government, though some forms, on average,
<br>
grow slower than others. &lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>### Yes, this is correct.
<br>
-------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet, it is not an argument against the government as such,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely an argument against the government in its present form.
</em><br>
<p>Not actually.  I submit that institutionalized coercive actions -- the
<br>
defining element of government -- externalize costs in a way that almost
<br>
makes it much more likely for government to grow at the expense of
<br>
society as well as for programs to grow in no relation to their actual
<br>
benefits.
<br>
<p>### Institutionalized coercive action is not restricted to the government.
<br>
Enforcement of informal contracts (as in loan sharking) is also coercive and
<br>
sometimes well organized.
<br>
<p>Could you provide more details on the externalization of costs due to gov't
<br>
action?
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><p>My argument is basically this.  Reason and force in society are
<br>
opposites.  If you use force, then you subjugate reason. 
<br>
<p>### Sometimes you have to use force to subjugate evil (an invading army),
<br>
and to extract payment for services rendered (demand taxes for the support
<br>
of a defensive army)
<br>
------
<br>
<p>I don't think so.  It's pretty clear in most situations what it means.
<br>
There may be borderline cases, but these are typically solved through
<br>
examining matters more closely AND do not bring social interaction to a
<br>
grinding halt.  For example, if I get the door of a restaurant, say, at
<br>
the same time as someone else, we don't shoot it out to see who gets to
<br>
go in first.:)
<br>
<p>### A couple guys with machine guns sit down in a mountain pass (which they
<br>
claim to own by inheritance from their ancestors). They say they will shoot
<br>
anybody trying to trespass, unless he pays a toll. I don't want to pay. They
<br>
cannot produce a valid title to the land. I ask them politely to leave, they
<br>
refuse and threaten to shoot me. I retreat, take a sniper's rifle and kill
<br>
them all. 
<br>
<p>Who initiated violence?
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>I would admit that in cases where coercion arises, one can and often
<br>
must use retaliatory coercion, but this is hardly what you mean.  Also,
<br>
it doesn't even go outside of libertarian thought.  For instance, crime,
<br>
such as theft or assault is obviously coercive.  However, do we need a
<br>
government -- i.e., a legal monopoly on the use of force -- to retaliate
<br>
against or prevent crime?  Hardly.
<br>
<p>### Are you able to point to historical examples of societies where a
<br>
non-monopoly system of coercive actions allowed effective control of crime?
<br>
<p>And how about examples of pluralistic systems of defense against external
<br>
aggression?
<br>
<p><pre>
----
<p>I also don't think this is what you have in mind.  Your scenario of an
agrarian planet that evolves from a free market to an strict oligarchy
is something entirely different, BUT it involves the upper classes
basically taking over an existing government.  I.e., you've already made
a monopoly on the use of legal force, so anyone or group who wants power
over society -- for whatever reason, e.g., self-defense, social
engineering, pure powerlust... -- only has to capture that institution.
<p>### By clever engineering you can make it pretty difficult to capture this
institution. A demarchy would be my way of approaching the problem.
<p>The upper classes *will* form a goverment if there is none (examples - just
name a country or city) (counterexamples?)
<p>----
<p><p>This doesn't mean that anarchocapitalism or variants of libertarian
anarchism will never evolve into states.  Obviously, the times/places in
history that have approached pure free markets in economics and politics
(e.g., the American West, Ancient Iceland, and so forth) eventually
evolved into societies with governments.  However, the process takes
longer.  I also believe we can learn from these examples to create
better institutions -- not perfect ones, but ones that can makes statism
much less likely than in the past.
<p>### It's interesting that you mention these examples of the ungoverned. Both
were transiently existing (=unstable?) societies, built by settlers escaping
states with increasing central powers (Norway united by King Harald, or
whatever his name was), or escaping population pressure. Both came from
warlike cultures, worshipping military prowess, well armed but without
significant external forces to contend with (American Indians were
subjugated with the help of the government, so you could say that the
American West was for from an anarchy - it was crucially dependent on
external sources of military protection and human resources). Hardly the
usual kind of circumstances, and very transient. As soon as the settlers
settled in, built homes and businesses, a government evolved. Is it a
parasite on the healthy chaos, or is it a prerequisite for further
development? 
<p>Just a rhetoric question.
<p>But I agree that institutions need to be formed to prevent the unbridled
growth of government, acting as a system of checks on its power.
<p><p>-------
She's not mine.:)  Also, I find her arguments in this area (and in
others) too abstract and often stacked to be of much use.  It seems to
me she lays out a good foundation for anarchism, then she backs away
from it because she wants limited government.  No doubt, some of this is
due to her times and to her experience in the Soviet Union.  This
doesn't completely throw out her arguments against anarchism, but they
are sophomoric.  (Her main one being that anarchism = choas.  Her more
specialized critique of anarchocapitalism is that she believe competing
protection agencies would violently battle it out whenever they
disagreed on who coerced whom.)
<p><p>### Won't they? (historic counterexamples?)
<p>--------
<p>&gt; Governments (starting at the village chief level) are an unavoidable
&gt; element in the development of civilization, emerging spontaneously,
&gt; like eusociality, or herd behaviors, allowing coordinated activities
&gt; and expanding the abilities of the society as a whole. I sincerely
&gt; doubt you could give me an example of an ungoverned society
&gt; achieving anything significant, especially survival among governed
&gt; ones.
<p>This is a point of contention and merely asserting what you believe does
not prove it.
<p>### Until you give an example disproving my belief, I will persist in it -
presence of innumerable examples supporting my claim is enough for me,
Popperian epistemology notwithstanding.
<p>-----
<p>  In fact, spontaneous orders evolve all around us.  Even
before there can be a government, there has to be a huge degree of
coordination.
<p>### No, all you need is having a stick bigger than the your neighbors have.
<p>----
<p>I don't Vinge intended it to be read that way either.  His short story
&quot;The Ungoverned&quot; and his commentary on it leads me to believe he think
anarchocapitalism is a very delicate situation likely to turn into
statism when the first social crisis hits.  I disagree here, but I do
think anarchocapitalism, in order to work, would have to be
thoroughgoing and not halfbaked.  You can't have things like centralized
government control in one area and none in another. 
<p>### Who will pay for the eradication of all goverments everywhere? What good
is a system that can so easily be destabilized by &quot;unenlightened&quot; neighbors?
<p>-----
<p>Also, since Vinge wrote _The Peace War_, a lot of work has been done in
the field of libertarian anarchism.  The number of books examining the
topic has mushroomed and historical and theoretical research has
advanced significantly.  Just to mention one, Bruce L. Benson's 1990
book _Enterprise of Law: Justice without the State_ relies on a lot of
recent (for 1990:) research that just wasn't around in the 1960s and
1970s when Rothbard and a few others were already make the case for
anarchocapitalism.  Even Hoppe's model of anarchocapitalism and his
praxeological analysis of government, though he relies on a lot of
scholarship from the 19th and early 20th century, is something very
new -- with a long gestation period from the mid-1980s.
<p>What I'm trying to get across here is the theory is advancing as it
embraces more criticisms and evidence.
<p>### I am sorry, I haven't read the books you mention. Maybe that's why I
persist in my ways ;-) Can you perhaps briefly summarize their specific
arguments?
<p>-----
I don't think anyone on this list would admit to taking a dogmatic
position.  Dogmatism is always a label attached to the other person's
views.:)
<p>### Touche! Sorry, just a slip into the adversarial argumentation mode.
