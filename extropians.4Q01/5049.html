</em><br>
<p>So you can get back to gossip and chitchat, instead of discussing
<br>
important issues like how various cultures might influence the future
<br>
course of western democracies?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  If Extropy and ExI takes a serious hit from

<p>You mean if it hampers their ability to snag consultation fees from
<br>
business lobbies  for providing justification for further
<br>
globalization and immigration? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Only the most clueless of Singularity gradualists, in severe hard takeoff
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why use the Singulartarian jargon so much?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are no &quot;Indians&quot;.  There are no &quot;Afghani&quot;.  There are only humans. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanism, and Singularitarianism, are basically egalitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophies, 
</em><br>
<p>Is your bank account egalitarian, too?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no reason why the happiness of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American computer programmer should weigh more in my calculations than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happiness of an Indian computer programmer.  They are both the same kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of entity.  They are both evolved biological organisms.  
</em><br>
<p>If you and I buy a house and live in it (oh, the jargon, the
<br>
jargon...), can Joe Schmoe down the street come live in it for free?
<br>
After all, he is an evolved biological organism....
<br>
<p>The problem is that the globalists have conveniently forgotten the
<br>
social contract.  The American programmer has ancestors who built this
<br>
country.  He is a citizen and owns this country jointly with the rest
<br>
of the American citizens, and he has a right to compete for that job,
<br>
His ancestors built this property up from wilderness and willed their
<br>
share to him. The globalists, for who EXI, et al, wish to provide
<br>
consultation services (read &quot;justification services&quot;) wish to
<br>
disregard the social contract, and effectively write off social
<br>
contract debts. How convenient.  That is, however, a form of theft,
<br>
and I feel the perpetrators should be brought before a court of
<br>
justice.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason why one would have any greater intrinsic worth than the other. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Humans may spend most of their day dividing into factions and fighting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but that doesn't mean the factions are real, it just means that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people sadly lack the perspective of species-wide unity which is provided
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by thinking about transhumanity and uploads and AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, that's what it's really about.  I think it'd be nice if everyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agrees with this reasoning posts a &quot;Me too!&quot;, and everyone who disagrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the argument but agrees with the conclusion posts a note saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as well.  
</em><br>
<p>Consider it done....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The people who are new to the list need to see something to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outweigh some of the poisonous remarks 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;poisonous remarks&quot;, huh? That's lovely...the globalists go into
<br>
theiving mode, commence massive waves of propaganda, and the few
<br>
dissenters are demonized.
