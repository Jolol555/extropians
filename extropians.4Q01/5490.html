<em>&gt; I agree that if any company in the world has a motivation to fund such work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be West; but your employer has been notoriously slow to adopt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological innovation -- perhaps because of their long history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly.
</em><br>
<p>Monopoly tends to oppose technological innovation only to the extent that
<br>
monopoly does not *need* technological innovation in order to continue to
<br>
defend itself. For example, Microsoft (or some other company) could
<br>
conceivably develop automated jurisprudence software, patent it, and have a
<br>
monopoly. To defend that monopoly, Microsoft (or West Legal Group, MS Software
<br>
Division) may then develop cutting-edge and innovative technology in the form
<br>
of lawyer-bots and human-competitive expert systems that could win in court.
<br>
<p>So, would WLG want to bury the Singularity, or own it? I think they (or a
<br>
borganized future group) are already well on the way to owning it. To
<br>
paraphrase Moravec, we'll learn to love the borg... it will be so much nicer
<br>
than civilization.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
