<p>
In a report releassed by the local media today, Finland's old capital of
<br>
Turku announced that Linux will be its exclusive operating system on
<br>
city-run computers and networks already next fall.
<br>
<p>It's hard to argue against the cost of using the Linux OS, since it is
<br>
absolutely free -- which certainly can't be said for Microsoft's. In fact,
<br>
it was projections from Microsoft itself noting as high as 75% short-term
<br>
operational cost increases which ended up being the key reason why the City
<br>
of Turku, together with other municipalities in the land of Linux's birth,
<br>
initiated its investigations into the viability of eliminating Microsoft
<br>
from the equation entirely. A complete switchover to Linux is set to save
<br>
the economically challenged city millions each year.
<br>
<p>Intermittent system failures combined with Microsoft systems' pronounced
<br>
vulnerability to virus attacks and hacker intrigue were also important
<br>
criteria affecting the decision. &quot;It's actually nothing new,&quot; administrative
<br>
director Jouko Lehmusto commented. &quot;We've been dissatisfied with Microsoft's
<br>
way of doing things for years.&quot; It is also widely believed that as Turku
<br>
adopts Linux other municipalities, following the city's test run, will
<br>
follow suit.
<br>
<p>Turku also plans to introduce the OS originally developed by Finnish
<br>
software guru Linus Torvald into its school and university systems. The user
<br>
programs replacing Microsoft's come under the &quot;OpenOffice&quot; banner, largely
<br>
made up of clones and facsimiles of the giant Seattle-based corporation's
<br>
own &quot;Office&quot; suite.
<br>
<p>On the State level, the Finnish Ministry of Finance has also launched an
<br>
investigation into the possibilities of dumping Windows and the MS OS in
<br>
favor of the &quot;happy penguin&quot; (Linux's ubiquitous mascot).
<br>
<p>It's not just Finland which is poised to nationally threaten Microsoft's
<br>
gargantuan empire. Both Germany and France have officially resolved to give
<br>
favor to Linux, and even China now incorporates its own so-called &quot;Red Flag&quot;
<br>
version.
