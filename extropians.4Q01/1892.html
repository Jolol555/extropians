<p>While I'm pretty offended at the idea of someone on this list using a
<br>
neo-nazi as some sort of reputable reference, this quote goes to
<br>
illustrate how socialism permeates nazi thinking outside of their racist
<br>
bigotry. While technically an apt term to describe the lending of
<br>
capital at interest, it is semantically meant to make the individual
<br>
feel like they are cattle being led to the slaughter. This, outside of
<br>
its racial bigotry, is entirely in line with the arguments of leftilists
<br>
as well as others on this list like Samantha, et al.
<br>
<p>First, it ignores the fact that individuals borrowing money do so
<br>
voluntarily. Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessary to do so to
<br>
make your way in the world. It is rather the fault of purely
<br>
*protestant* ethics of public status, personal productivity and
<br>
industry, that engender the desire of people to enslave themselves to
<br>
the bank to get the capital they feel they need to either support their
<br>
dependents and/or reach the potential that others say they have.
