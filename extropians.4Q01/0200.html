<em>&gt; Sufism is definitely linked with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam.
</em><br>
<p>Just so; as transhumanism is definitely linked with humanism; or as science is
<br>
linked with philosophy; or as humans are linked with Cro-Magnons.
<br>
<p>It is the offspring...
<br>
and the parent has died.
<br>
<p>&quot;To the Sufi, Islam means surrender and love. An organic transformation and
<br>
combination of two qualities, which creates a third. The sage is the
<br>
burgeoning of two kinds of energy. In the definition of the Sufi, he is
<br>
balanced, without any duality, and his wholeness is unified; there is a silent
<br>
tranquility about him. There is no longer any conflict or antagonism going on
<br>
in him. He is not torn between sin and saintliness. There is a sublime peace
<br>
and equilibrium, a cosmic silence. That's what Sufis call _islam_.
<br>
I know, because a wise old Turk once told me so.&quot;
<br>

<p>Mulla Nasruddin tells the story of Charles Atlas:
<br>
<p>Charles Atlas and his wife were standing in front of the gorilla cage at the
<br>
zoo. Suddenly, the gorilla reached through the bars, pulled the woman into his
<br>
cage and started to rip off her clothes.
<br>
She screamed, &quot;Charles, what do I do now?&quot;
<br>
Atlas shrugged and replied, &quot;Tell him you have a headache, dear.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
