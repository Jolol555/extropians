</em><br>
<p>And if you cannot get at the information, how are you supposed to learn

anything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, for example, a limited knowledge of molecular biology, genetic

</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationally (events of the last month being a possible case in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, in my research for my book on the Swedish genetics debate I
<br>
have come to a different conclusion. It is not an issue of limited
<br>
knowledge, since when you educate people they tend to just believe more
<br>
in their previous positive or negative views of GMOs. What makes take
<br>
these positions is instead underlying values and worldviews of how
<br>
things really work and what they mean. In the common romantic worldview
<br>
of many people, there exists a natural order which is inherently the
<br>
best and most moral state, and any change of it is for ill and
<br>
unethical. This can then be shored up with religious arguments,
<br>
environmental arguments and cited facts, but at the core it is based on
<br>
an ethical view that isn't based on knowledge or facts. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To take two recent Extropian topics --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;Aging isn't a disease&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    -- Do we have any question that Laura Bradbard from the FDA has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       done the extensive survey that Robert Freitas has done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       to begin a rational classification of what &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       a &quot;disease&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think she is basing her statement on a long debate in the
<br>
community of medical philosophers that has largely reached a conclusion
<br>
like this. She might not have come up with it on her own, but it is the
<br>
result of quite some thinking. 
<br>
<p>In fact, Robert is the lone outsider I think most medical philosophers
<br>
would regard as badly informed and educated. We might agree with his
<br>
views and think they make sense, but to convince the rest of people
<br>
involved in this issue requires a lot of writing and debating, extending
<br>
and refining the ideas enormously. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &quot;Fwd: Secrecy foe scrubs data on Internet&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    -- Do we have any evidence that any potential terrorists have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       not already obtained the information on these sites (in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       case scrubbing it is pointless) or that scrubbing it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       likely to increase security? (It may decrease it since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       scrubbing may not allow members of the general public to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       what potential targets may exist and exercise a right to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       proximity to such targets).
</em><br>
<p>I would be surprised if they had obtained any information from these
<br>
sites - there are still many more non-net sources of relevant
<br>
information of terrorist interest. The scrubbing likely decreased the
<br>
utility to terrorists very slightly, while decreasing it for everybody
<br>
else far more (even when multiplying the terrorist utility with
<br>
devastation potential). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should the knowledge to manufacture chemical weapons or biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons be available to those who would use them unextropically?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the concept developed in the Aristoi -- that one had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to develop the skills to use knowledge productively and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust relationships that you would use such skills in an extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion are worthy of consideration.
</em><br>
<p>Note that you here seem to be talking about *information*, not being
<br>
allowed to *do* things. Nothing in Aristoi suggests that nanotech
<br>
information was kept secret from people, just the actual nanotech. 
<br>
Having restrictions on behavior is something entirely different from
<br>
restrictions of information. 
<br>
<p>Also, _Aristoi_ is to a large extent a brilliant deconstruction of the
<br>
political system described therein. Instead of just saying &quot;this is
<br>
wrong and won't work in reality&quot;, Williams imagines a best case
<br>
situation where the enlightened despots really are enlightened (even the
<br>
villains!), the best possible people for the job and with the tech to do
<br>
it. Still, the system doesn't quite work on several levels. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not believe we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully dealt with the issue of when &quot;freedom&quot; is extropic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g. from Extropian Principles 3.0, Section 5, &quot;Open Society&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;freedom of speech, freedom of action, freedom of experimentation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runs directly up against, Section 6, &quot;Self-Direction&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;independent thinking, indepdendent freedom, personal responsibility&quot;
</em><br>
<p>In what way? I think you read it as &quot;I have the right to do whatever I
<br>
want, to whoever I want&quot; and hence see a contradiction. But the
<br>
principles are based in the liberal &quot;my rights end where yours start&quot;
<br>
scheme of things, where there is no contradiction - I am free, as long
<br>
as I do not diminish your freedom. 
<br>
<p>I think the problem here is that when Max wrote the principles he was
<br>
leaning on a *huge* literature of political and philosophical thinking
<br>
on these issues, and it is assumed as a background. If you just read
<br>
them literally with no intellectual context they make far less sense and
<br>
might even look ridiculous (a few swedish social democrats I tried them
<br>
on simply could not undertand them).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you have the freedom to speak for the destruction of a people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have the right to act towards such a goal?
</em><br>
<p>The traditional liberal/libertarian answer would be that that all
<br>
speech, even hate speech, should be free while acting on the hate speech
<br>
would not be allowed. There are some subtelities about whether certain
<br>
forms of speech constitutes an action which has been debated extensively
<br>
by legal scholars. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should &quot;independent thinking&quot; be promoted if it is &quot;irrational&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (violating principle 7)?  &quot;Remaining open to challenges to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs and practices&quot; seems to leave open the door to people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being willing to sacrifice their lives to challenge your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and practices.
</em><br>
<p>If you try to only allow independent thinking that is rational, you are
<br>
going to end up with dependent thinking - you only allow *some*
<br>
acceptable thoughts, and the true independent thinkers will express
<br>
their independence by becoming irrational. What you should do is to
<br>
*promote* rational and independent thinking.
<br>
<p>Your interpretation of the &quot;remaining open&quot; text is downright bizarre. A
<br>
stone is not an argument. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is a fundamental question for me -- on the one hand I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly like the information to be available to overthrow an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppressive government dedicated to limiting my freedoms.  At the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time I am reluctant to adapt a position that makes such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information available to people (essentially &quot;other tribes&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would like to use it not only to destroy my security shield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but *my* way of thinking entirely (be it *either* a U.S. self-preservation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or an extropic maximization of information content perspective).
</em><br>
<p>I have already answered this in my previous post (they arrive in a
<br>
strange order, must be my EPR bridge acting as a time machine again). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should access to information be based on accreditation?
</em><br>
<p>No. I have already given ethical and practical arguments for why free
<br>
information is good, and there are many more in the literature.
<br>
<p>If you have a piece of information you might of course choose not to
<br>
reveal it to me or anyone else, and I support your right to do so. But
<br>
once information is out, it is out there and cannot be put back into the
<br>
bottle. Hence accreditation will not work other than act as a partial
<br>
filter of information, which is quite likely worse than having no filter
<br>
at all - you get people with *partial* dangerous information. 
<br>
<p>Also, the accreditation service is going to be a dangerous bottleneck.
<br>
What happens if it is corrupt or has an agenda? Even worse, if the
<br>
information can only be judged by someone knowledgeable in it, how can
<br>
others hold the accreditors accountable? Imagine a situation where
<br>
medical knowledge was only given to members of the medical community,
<br>
and outsiders not allowed access to it, even when they suspected
<br>
something malicious was going on.
<br>
<p>I consider the accreditation idea chillingly similar to something Bill
<br>
Joy would propose (don't give him the idea! :-)
