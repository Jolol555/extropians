A response to Rafal Smigrodzki, Part 1On Sunday, December 23, 2001 2:35

PM Smigrodzki, Rafal <a href="mailto:SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU?Subject=Re:%20A%20response%20to%20Rafal%20Smigrodzki,%20Part%201&In-Reply-To=&lt;004001c18e9b$b9d05d80$1b87ecd1@neptune&gt;">SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU</a> wrote:

<em>&gt;&gt; Not actually.  I submit that institutionalized coercive actions --
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; defining element of government -- externalize costs in a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; almost makes it much more likely for government to grow at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; expense of society as well as for programs to grow in no relation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to their actual benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institutionalized coercive action is not restricted to the government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enforcement of informal contracts (as in loan sharking) is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercive and sometimes well organized.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree there is nongovernmental instituationalized coercion,
<br>
but then you admit that government is a form of this and perhaps the
<br>
most pervasive form.  An example of the former would be a crime
<br>
syndicate.  (It's notable, however, that most criminal organizations
<br>
usually benefit from some legal prohition, such as against prostitution,
<br>
gambling, drug use, and the like.  Also, contract enforcement, in itself
<br>
is not initiation of coercion.  After all, the breaker of a contract is
<br>
coercing the other party.  For example, if you contract with me to
<br>
borrow money at a set interest rate and payment schedule, and then don't
<br>
pay me on time at the agreed on rate, you are, in essense stealing from
<br>
me.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could you provide more details on the externalization of costs due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to gov't action?
</em><br>
<p>Government doesn't have to sell its services since it can tax (or use
<br>
other policies that amount to the same thing), so there's no connection
<br>
between the consumer of its services and those who pay for them.  (Even
<br>
in the case of so called user fees, the government has a monopoly on the
<br>
service, so that the buyer is forced to pay.)  This is, by definition
<br>
cost externalization -- i.e., any time the cost of something is paid
<br>
involuntarily by a third party, the cost has been externalized.  This
<br>
disconnects an essential feedback loop which markets and private firms
<br>
have.  (To cut you off before you make this argument:)...  This is not
<br>
to say there are no cost externalizations outside of government.  There
<br>
are, but individuals and private firms are usually very limited in what
<br>
they legitimately can do AND governments exist through such
<br>
externalization.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; My argument is basically this.  Reason and force in society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are opposites.  If you use force, then you subjugate reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes you have to use force to subjugate evil (an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invading army), and to extract payment for services rendered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (demand taxes for the support of a defensive army)
</em><br>
<p>No doubt.  I'm not arguing that retaliation or self-defense are
<br>
antireason, just the initiation of force outside those contexts.  (I
<br>
probably should have been more clear about this from the beginning.  I
<br>
gather you're not that familiar with the basic libertarian position.
<br>
It's not pacifism by any means, but seeks to disallow the initiation of
<br>
force in society.  Naturally, once someone initiates the use of force,
<br>
people have to defend themselves and justice demands retaliate in order
<br>
to set things right -- if they so choose.)  Taxation, however, is the
<br>
initiation of force.  Armies and defenses can and have been supported
<br>
privately as well as consensually in the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't think so.  It's pretty clear in most situations what it
</em><br>
means.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There may be borderline cases, but these are typically solved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; through examining matters more closely AND do not bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; social interaction to a grinding halt.  For example, if I get the
</em><br>
door
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of a restaurant, say, at the same time as someone else, we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; shoot it out to see who gets to go in first.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A couple guys with machine guns sit down in a mountain pass (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they claim to own by inheritance from their ancestors). They say they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will shoot anybody trying to trespass, unless he pays a toll. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to pay. They cannot produce a valid title to the land. I ask them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politely to leave, they refuse and threaten to shoot me. I retreat,
</em><br>
take
<br>
<em>&gt; a sniper's rifle and kill them all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who initiated violence?
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by valid title?  If they have no right to the land,
<br>
then you were only acting in self-defense.  If they do, then you're a
<br>
murderer.  Deciding who has the right is the problem.  (This doesn't
<br>
mean libertarian anarchy of any variety is perfect and will solve all
<br>
problems, but I think it will solve many more than other political
<br>
systems.)
<br>
<p>What happens, to switch scenarios, if those same guys are members of the
<br>
&quot;cannot produce a valid title&quot; to the pass?  What if the same outcome
<br>
occurs?  How does this differ from what we have right now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I would admit that in cases where coercion arises, one can and often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; must use retaliatory coercion, but this is hardly what you mean.
</em><br>
Also,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it doesn't even go outside of libertarian thought.  For instance,
</em><br>
crime,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such as theft or assault is obviously coercive.  However, do we need
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; government -- i.e., a legal monopoly on the use of force -- to
</em><br>
retaliate
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; against or prevent crime?  Hardly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you able to point to historical examples of societies where a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-monopoly system of coercive actions allowed effective control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of crime?
</em><br>
<p>Pre-Norwegian conquest Iceland, Medieval Ireland, Anglosaxon England,
<br>
and the Old West in the US.  these examples are covered by David
<br>
Friedman (Iceland), Murray Rothbard (Ireland), and Bruce L. Benson
<br>
(England, US).  There are others, but I believe someone else on this
<br>
list covered them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And how about examples of pluralistic systems of defense against
</em><br>
external
<br>
<em>&gt; aggression?
</em><br>
<p>I refer you to the work of Larry Sechrest on using private armies and
<br>
navies.  Up until the 19th century, when professional militaries became
<br>
the rule, privateers and the like were regularly used.  Also, the Middle
<br>
Ages can be seen as a time when, through circumstances -- the collapse
<br>
of governments throughout Western Europe and the various invasions --
<br>
private military forces were the rule not the exception in Western
<br>
Europe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I also don't think this is what you have in mind.  Your scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of an agrarian planet that evolves from a free market to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; strict oligarchy is something entirely different, BUT it involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the upper classes basically taking over an existing government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I.e., you've already made a monopoly on the use of legal force,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; so anyone or group who wants power over society -- for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whatever reason, e.g., self-defense, social engineering, pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; powerlust... -- only has to capture that institution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By clever engineering you can make it pretty difficult to capture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this institution. A demarchy would be my way of approaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by the term demarchy?  It seems to me, all existing and
<br>
previous governments were captured by or even created ruling classes.
<br>
Even current parliamentary democracies are no exception to this.
<br>
Special interest groups, e.g., and politicians synergize in them to
<br>
extract wealth from the taxpayer base.  There's little reason to believe
<br>
this would not be the case even with clever engineering.  After all,
<br>
even with the checks and balances of the U.S. Constitutin, the legal
<br>
traditions of England, and so on, all ruling classes have basically
<br>
gotten around the &quot;clever engineering.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The upper classes *will* form a goverment if there is none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (examples - just name a country or city) (counterexamples?)
</em><br>
<p>See the above examples from Friedman et al.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This doesn't mean that anarchocapitalism or variants of libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anarchism will never evolve into states.  Obviously, the times/places
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; history that have approached pure free markets in economics and
</em><br>
politics
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (e.g., the American West, Ancient Iceland, and so forth) eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evolved into societies with governments.  However, the process takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; longer.  I also believe we can learn from these examples to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better institutions -- not perfect ones, but ones that can makes
</em><br>
statism
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much less likely than in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's interesting that you mention these examples of the ungoverned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both were transiently existing (=unstable?)
</em><br>
<p>Iceland's anarchist period lasted about two hundred years.  That's
<br>
longer than most existing nation states have been around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; societies, built by settlers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escaping states with increasing central powers (Norway united by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; King Harald, or whatever his name was), or escaping population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure. Both came from warlike cultures, worshipping military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prowess,
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that this applies to the American West.  Most of the
<br>
settlers were just there to farm and heard -- they were not warriors.
<br>
They also did not come from a warrior culture.
<br>
<p>In the Iceland example, while they could be called warriors, they
<br>
generally did not fight many wars.  If you read the sagas, which are
<br>
quite violent, you still come away with the idea of people looking to
<br>
settle down -- not to fight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; well armed but without significant external forces to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contend with (American Indians were subjugated with the help of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government, so you could say that the American West was for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an anarchy - it was crucially dependent on external sources of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military protection and human resources). Hardly the usual kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances, and very transient. As soon as the settlers settled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in, built homes and businesses, a government evolved. Is it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parasite on the healthy chaos, or is it a prerequisite for further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development?
</em><br>
<p>I admit the American West case is not the best example, but it has many
<br>
features of anarchism and, as far as law enforcement and adjudication
<br>
were concerned, was anarchic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just a rhetoric question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I agree that institutions need to be formed to prevent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unbridled growth of government, acting as a system of checks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on its power.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is, any checks on government that are internal to
<br>
government -- and this includes the typical separations of powers --
<br>
will, at best, only slow down the growth of government, but will, in the
<br>
long run, be routed.  In the interim, almost all of the governed will be
<br>
lulled into a false sense of security, since they'll believe, as many
<br>
constitutionalists today believe, that they've succeeded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; (Her main one being that anarchism = choas.  Her more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specialized critique of anarchocapitalism is that she believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; competing protection agencies would violently battle it out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whenever they disagreed on who coerced whom.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Won't they? (historic counterexamples?)
</em><br>
<p>The examples mentioned previous.  In fact, all the examples became
<br>
statist mainly because of encroaching states and not because of internal
<br>
conflict leading to a state forming  through the biggest, baddest,
<br>
meanest protection agency taking over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This is a point of contention and merely asserting what you believe
</em><br>
does
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not prove it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until you give an example disproving my belief, I will persist in it -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence of innumerable examples supporting my claim is enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me, Popperian epistemology notwithstanding.
</em><br>
<p>But you've provide no examples and I've provided a few.
<br>
<p>(What is the comment on Popperian epistemology about?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; In fact, spontaneous orders evolve all around us.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; before there can be a government, there has to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; huge degree of coordination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, all you need is having a stick bigger than the your neighbors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if you merely wish to rob them, but not if you wish to govern them
<br>
in the conventional sense.  A government, for one thing, relies on most
<br>
of the government not rising up and rebeling against it and not giving
<br>
enough resistence to it that governing is in effect impossible.
<br>
<p>But back to the spontaneous order thing, this is why the Spanish in
<br>
America found some of the Native Americans so difficult to rule.  Brute
<br>
force can only go so far, especially when the natives would just run
<br>
away.  One reason for this was that many of the natives just were not
<br>
used to the peasant lifestyle.  I'm not trying to paint them glamorously
<br>
as free nomads, but the point is they did not have that element of
<br>
culture necessary to make them easily ruled.
<br>
<p>Now, imagine, if you will, that other spontaneous orders had no evolve,
<br>
such as markets or language.  Any one person with a big stick might be
<br>
able to beat his neighbor into submission, but that's it.  His power
<br>
will extend no further than just that beating and that neighbor.  The
<br>
fact that other levels of social coordination do not exist would mean
<br>
the society itself would be no more than a bunch of people and, since
<br>
they don't trade or have division of labor, their wealth would be small.
<br>
Yeah, you could beat your neighbor for his piece of fruit, but not for
<br>
his bank account or business.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't Vinge intended it to be read that way either.  His short
</em><br>
story
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; and his commentary on it leads me to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; he think anarchocapitalism is a very delicate situation likely to
</em><br>
turn
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; into statism when the first social crisis hits.  I disagree here, but
</em><br>
I do
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think anarchocapitalism, in order to work, would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thoroughgoing and not halfbaked.  You can't have things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; centralized government control in one area and none in another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who will pay for the eradication of all goverments everywhere?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What good is a system that can so easily be destabilized by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;unenlightened&quot; neighbors?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't mean exactly that.  What I meant was we need to have complete
<br>
anarchism in one area at least -- not, say, deregulating the banking
<br>
system, education, and the buying of shoes, but keeping other things
<br>
heavily regulated.
<br>
<p>As for anarchist societies defending themselves from outside attackers,
<br>
I think both Sechrest and Hoppe answer this in a cogent way.  I think
<br>
anarchist societies can privately defend themselves and do this better
<br>
than current states.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sorry, I haven't read the books you mention. Maybe that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why I persist in my ways ;-) Can you perhaps briefly summarize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their specific arguments?
</em><br>
<p>I have been summarizing some of them, but I feel you should at least get
<br>
Hoppe's _Democracy -- the God that Failed_ and probably Benson's _The
<br>
Enterprise of Law_ for starters.  I'd rather you read them and then
<br>
commented on them.  One reason for this is that I might unintentionally
<br>
distort their arguments.  Another, is just that I'm trying to do some
<br>
other research right now and don't want to get too bogged down here in
<br>
this discussion.  (You kind of scared me by increasing the replies to
<br>
three instead of two or even reducing them to one.:)
<br>
<p>Also, would you use plain text instead of HTML in your replies?  It
<br>
would make it easier for those who can't read HTML.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
