I seem to recall during some of the recent discussion someone
<br>
saying the Oslo agreements gave Palestine ~90% of the land it
<br>
was supposed to have.
<br>
<p>This was in the NY Times today (by Schmemann):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether Mr. Arafat is perceived as a murderous terrorist, as a national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberation leader or as a tiresome pest, no one would seriously deny his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormous historical significance as the man who created the Palestinian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national movement in the 1960's and forced the fate of the Palestinians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onto the agendas of Israel, the United States, the Arab nations and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. Nor is it possible to belittle the wrenching choices he has made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognizing Israel, signing the Oslo agreements, giving up the Palestinian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national charter and accepting a fifth of mandated Palestine as his future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state.  So intimate is Mr. Arafat's identification with the entire history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Palestinian cause that the two are sometimes perceived as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable, endowing Mr. Arafat with authority to sign off on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fate of millions of Palestinians still living in refugee camps, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; borders of a new state and on the explosive issue of sharing Jerusalem.
</em><br>
<p>Note &quot;accepting a fifth of mandated Palestine&quot;.
<br>
<p>It would be nice if someone woudl do further research and could cite
<br>
some accurate sources as to how much of the Israel/Palestine area was
<br>
supposed to go to each group.
<br>
