<p>OK I had a hell of an idea today.
<br>
<p>My notion is that the ant migration I witnessed yesterday was
<br>
started by an ant that found a suitable place for moving the
<br>
colony, so she walked back to the colony trailing a chemical which
<br>
means in ant, &quot;everyone pick up a larva and walk this way.&quot;
<br>
<p>So here's the idea.  If I can find another ant migration in progress,
<br>
I attempt to recover and produce whatever chemical means
<br>
&quot;grab an egg and come&quot;.  Then whenever a colony of ants is
<br>
discovered in the house, one simply brushes a strip of the chemical
<br>
from there, leading to the outdoors.  Then the colony picks up
<br>
and walks right outta your house, carrying the young with them.
<br>
<p>So I need to create an instrument which would recognize the
<br>
difference between a zero-flux ant-line and a true one way
<br>
migration like the one I saw yesterday.  Wouldnt that work?
<br>
<p>I even had an inspiration on how to recover some of that
<br>
chemical.  When I watched the migration I noticed that the
<br>
forward antflux was about 10/second, and the reverse
<br>
had about 1/second or perhaps 0.5/second.  So what were
<br>
the backwards goers doing?  I figure they must be &quot;repeaters&quot;,
<br>
gals going back along the line replenishing the scent trail which
<br>
would otherwise evaporate.  Does that sound right?  They
<br>
would walk backwards along the trail, excreting a new line
<br>
of come-this-way-juice.  What else would they be doing?
<br>
<p>So when I find a migration, I need to capture the backwards
<br>
walkers and find out what they are excreting.  Right?  spike
