<p>gee... if you haven't learned language and art when you was

young it can be even classified as debilism (i.e. verbal

debilism occur in deep autism, or musical debilism in amusia)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Well, it could of course be the legality aspect. Weird

<p><em>&gt; magnetic fields are currently classed as drugs. But there

<p>LSD is a strong D2 receptor agonists, which is responsible for
<br>
socialisation (feelings, not actions, so during LSD trip 
<br>
tripper must be guided into social situations, or must release 
<br>
serotonin to act properly (i.e. trough MDMA intake, often 
<br>
called 'candyflipping') 
<br>
after ignition of social relationship D2 receptor holds on 
<br>
bonding, especially emphathy (but LSD overall action is 
<br>
uncertain)
<br>
<p>serotonin is involved in _actions_, releasing serotonin causes 
<br>
increased socialisation, but not empathy (it is easy to perform 
<br>
social task when serotonin is released)
<br>
<p>while re-uptake inhibitors are dangerous, fluoxetine like 
<br>
amphetamine causes increased breakdown of neurochemical 
<br>
involved (but (un)fortunatelly do not release any serotonine, 
<br>
it is possible only thru chemical interaction of unknown (yet) 
<br>
neuotransmitter.
<br>
<p>yeah, it is surely linked with autism, but noone knows which 
<br>
way, instead of measuring levels and trying to corelate it 
<br>
would be much more efficient to drop E and see what happens.
<br>
(i saw many people without any social skills (mainly ... geeks)
<br>
picking up geek girls on rave parties after E (it is last thing 
<br>
a geek would do on rave party, usually they chat about their 
<br>
work or life, which is highly non-social, rave party is usually 
<br>
aimed at psychedelics, empathy, and feeling the music, and each 
<br>
other, geeks usually have to do a visual presentation or a 
<br>
audio mix (or both in a so called 'demo') to express 
<br>
themselves, while all others with standard social understanding 
<br>
usually just absorb it ...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, inability to understand art doesn't sound specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to autism. There are many other agnosias, amusia and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course lack of interest that can explain that. If professor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Snyder claims he cannot understand art, then his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding or naming of what constitutes artistic skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be somewhat suspect.
</em><br>
<p>exactly. 
<br>
amusia can lead to musical autism. there are many kinds of 
<br>
amusia, the common symptom is 'being a fan of xxx' while 
<br>
ignoring all other genres, which is somehow normal but only  
<br>
_on short run_, i.e. someone who is actually digging a piece 
<br>
can become a fan of sth. for a month, or if'll find a piece 
<br>
which exactly describes his current personality or social set 
<br>
it can last even longer.
<br>
<p>if someone is listening over and over only to one axiom of 
<br>
musical language it is a good thing to consider amusia, and 
<br>
send him to apropriate treatment (i.e. give him rap-tapes, 
<br>
which are made by amusiacs, or aim him at poetry)
<br>
<p>snyder claimed that is unable to create art, maybe he can dig 
<br>
it, and was particulary interested in graphics. 
<br>
again - to not mix definitions - 
<br>
autism is a 'loss of communication disorder'
<br>
normally is an _conditon_ and sometimes can be _persistent_ 
<br>
(brain damage) 
<br>
can occur in areas of communication such as verbalisation, 
<br>
emotional interpretation, misunderstanding art language (as 
<br>
value instead of language), can be result of damaged social 
<br>
memory and lack of social associations, or all at the same time.
<br>
<p><p>amusia is particular musical language disorder similiar to lack 
<br>
of visual distinguishing between objects, or i.e. daltonism.
<br>
<p>it can lead to autism if untreated (hopefully nonpersistent)
<br>
<p>i think we can discuss it after releasing of new DSM.
