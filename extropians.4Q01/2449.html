</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A world full of nanotech is of course a dangerous place, but so is any

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the answer is a clear yes to nano: it is so useful that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth the risks, and I think we can handle them. Having a diverse group

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Quite simply, putting full blown nanotech into the hands of a single
<br>
dangerous person would make 9/11 look like a little pinprick. I think
<br>
your proposal of openly developing potential weapons of mass destruction
<br>
is utterly naive. It would be something like openly developing nukes
<br>
in a parallel universe where any matter is capable of being used as
<br>
the core. The end result would have been that everyone would have
<br>
built them, and instead of a cold war we would have had something much
<br>
worse.
<br>
<p>What exactly is your scenario for where terrorists have drextech and
<br>
yet don't cause severe worldwide damage? A nanotech immune system?
<br>
And what happens when they come up with a worm that breaches the
<br>
defenses? Humans have already proven themselves incapable of devising
<br>
a system that would prevent such disasters.
<br>
<p>Why fool around with such a possibility when leaving the nanotech
<br>
carefully centralized would probably still allow for 90% of the
<br>
usefulness? Do I really need a home assembler? What for?
