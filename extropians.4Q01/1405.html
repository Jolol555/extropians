<em>&gt; wherein we find launch costs estimated at $600/Kg (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1990 dollars) for a 200 kg payload.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe--someone care to confirm?--that this is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; using conventional, ie multistage rockets, methods.
</em><br>
<p>Beware of any cost to orbit estimates made by anyone- *none* have ever
<br>
survived contact with the real world.  Not one.
<br>
<p>Bull's superguns would have eliminated only the first stage of a launch
<br>
system; the net energy imparted to the projectile would give about 2-3
<br>
km/s velocity at apogee, where several stages of solid rockets would
<br>
have to fire for the remaining 4-5 km/s needed to get into orbit.  These
<br>
rocket stages would have to be able to take about +2000 and -50 gee
<br>
accelerations, and would need an excellent ablative protection for the
<br>
ascent at mach 8 or more.  Getting _any_ payload into orbit out of a
<br>
2000 kg gun projectile would have been challenging.
<br>
<p>First stage boosters are relatively cheap, and can be scaled as needed
<br>
to support an upper stage design.  With optimal acceleration a &quot;soft&quot;
<br>
vehicle can use cheap propellant like LOX/kerosene and high propellant
<br>
fraction to reach orbit with just two stages, as opposed to the heavy
<br>
structures and low performance of solid motors which would need three
<br>
stages *after* the gun launch.
<br>
<p>Gerry Bull sold the Iraqis a line of &quot;Bull&quot; that never could have been
<br>
an economical space launch system... which was fine by them because they
<br>
just wanted to drop warheads on Tel Aviv and Tehran.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would seem to me that for any payload capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; withstanding the rigors of such a launch method--bulk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payloads of food, water, fuel, and building materials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately come to mind--the economic advantages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun launch present a striking commercial opportunity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Additionally, and logically, for anyone interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more human activity in space, a dual-mode launch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy, based on the complementarity of gun and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rocket launch methods, would seem a promising means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that end.
</em><br>
<p>Far more promising is a fully reusable small space transport with a high
<br>
flight rate- at least 2-3 three sorties per week per vehicle- ideally
<br>
daily.  Low utilization will make *any* vehicle uneconomical; fly a 747
<br>
once a month rather than daily and the fixed costs will eat you alive.
<br>
<p>Any payload larger than a human being can be spread across many
<br>
launches, habitats can use inflatable structures to give comfortable
<br>
room sizes, and routine access to space will drop the cost of labor in
<br>
space (the current reason for NOT doing major orbital outfitting). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also,  sometime back I read that the PV solar panels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the Internation Space Station generate 65 kw and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost $500,000,000.  Now I can't verify the accuracy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that number--I no longer remember where I read it--but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I recall thinking that half a billion dollars for 65
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kw seemed a bit much, and it got me to thinking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-tech power generation in space.  Specifically, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envisioned, as the basis for such a system, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parabolic dish made of minimum thickness  styrofoam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and coated with a film of appropriate reflective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material.
</em><br>
<p>The high cost is due to several factors- the first being that the panels
<br>
like most gov't aerospace products are purchased on a cost-plus
<br>
contract.  The insidious nature of this process is stunning- if some
<br>
clever engineer points out that making the panels twice as big and only
<br>
half as efficient will cut their price by ten while doubling the launch
<br>
cost, he'll be unemployed in a heartbeat because the contractor profits
<br>
more by making the product *more* expensive.  If your profit is five
<br>
percent of &quot;x&quot;, the tendency is to mark up &quot;x&quot; as far as the customer
<br>
will take without screaming. This completely perverts any market
<br>
incentives.
<br>
<p>Secondary effects, like non recurring engineering costs, the demand for
<br>
absurd reliability, and the lack of line-servicability, just help the
<br>
contractor inflate the prices.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For comparison purposes, at 10% conversion efficiency,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 1300 watts/sq meter, you can get 65 kw out of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dish a mere 13m in radius.  (And a dish of 100m radius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delivers a healthy 4 mega watts.)
</em><br>
<p>Solar dynamic systems were proposed way back when, but got lost in the
<br>
design reviews in the early 90s, largely due to NIH.  By using molten
<br>
salt thermal storage at the collector, they could have maintained
<br>
constant power output throughout the orbit, without need of massive deep
<br>
cycling batteries during eclipse.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Two immediate obsevations.  Weightlessness would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow an EXTREMELY large dish, and the hard vacuum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of space seems to suggest that the reflective surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be subject to oxidative degradation.
</em><br>
<p>In fairness, the atomic oxygen environment in LEO is pretty nasty- I'd
<br>
recommend a good strong anodized coating on any aluminum reflectors. 
<br>
Weightlessness does not eliminate all forces on a large structure, and
<br>
in the case of ISS, the plumes from the space shuttle maneuvering
<br>
engines exert large forces on solar arrays- they are turned on edge
<br>
during dockings to prevent ripping them loose.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As to size, anyone care to suggest how big is too big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and why?
</em><br>
<p>Drag.  Stations in LEO must make up drag from the upper atmosphere.  On
<br>
the other hand, solar dynamic systems do appear to need less area than
<br>
photovoltaics, and on the gripping hand excess power could be used to
<br>
run an electrodynamic tether to do drag makeup without propellant.  Joe
<br>
Carroll at Tether Applications built a tether that could have kept Mir
<br>
aloft, but it was classed as a munition and was blocked from export by
<br>
the State Department in 2000.  Yet another example of George Abbey's JSC
<br>
mafia calling in favors to block the competition.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I envision the dish as spin stabilized to keep it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointed at the sun, with steam generator, and dual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter-rotating turbine/generator units axially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mounted, and the waste heat radiator located in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shadow behind the dish.
</em><br>
<p>Dual-spin devices are a pain, and if they are counter rotating there is
<br>
no net angular momentum to maintain pointing.  Spin stabilizing doesn't
<br>
work for sun tracking, anyway, since the sun line moves about a degree a
<br>
day which would require torquing the spun vehicle.  Use three-axis
<br>
active stabilization, and arrange the rotating machinery to have zero
<br>
net momentum.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I have a nifty little idea for the design of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiator.  A conical 'balloon', perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stiffened/stabilized with an axial mast, into which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exhaust steam is vented.  As it condenses, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spin of the system will send the droplets toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner surface of the balloon where the 'slope' will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause the liquid to flow back to the rim of the dish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for reinjection to the steam generator.
</em><br>
<p>Radiators are difficult to make low-mass, efficient, *and* long life,
<br>
because micrometeorites will puncture them leading to coolant loss. 
<br>
Multiple heat pipes with whipple shields are the order of the day, and
<br>
you'll still need to replace a fraction every year as they lose their
<br>
fluid.  Design for maintainability and use cheap manpower to lower
<br>
overall system costs.
<br>
<p>Stirling or brayton cycle engines are simpler and more reliable than
<br>
rankine engines, and don't have phase seperation issues to deal with in
<br>
zero gee.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My engineering background always makes low-tech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap more appealing than high-tech and expensive.
</em><br>
<p>That's a useful bias, but sometimes it's hard to tell which option
<br>
really is low-tech and cheap- the devil is in the details.
