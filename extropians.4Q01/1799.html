<p>The main criteria for calling an action &quot;theft&quot; is whether or not
<br>
it is illegal/immoral. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>#### The word &quot;immoral&quot; is so very fraught with meaning... Let me try to
<br>
briefly tell how I would apply it in this situation: The reason why most of
<br>
us (usually at Kohlberg stages 3 and above) think taking somebody else's
<br>
orange without his permission is bad, is because allowing such behavior in a
<br>
society would lead to a breakdown of the economy, and diminished survival.
<br>
For the majority of us any human action that elicits in us the fear of
<br>
undeserved death is considered immoral.
<br>
<p>It is further corroborated by another example: breathing in the molecules
<br>
exhaled and released into the environment by another person is not
<br>
considered immoral, or theft, even if this person (or the King himself)
<br>
would strenuously forbid it. Since our life and way of life are not
<br>
threatened by reusing somebody else's air (and are indeed indispensable for
<br>
it), we do not think it should be called theft, even though the person's
<br>
property (the air in his lungs) becomes somebody else's property, usually
<br>
without explicit consent.
<br>
<p>The long-term economic and survival impact of an action can change depending
<br>
on the physical and social context. If free music downloading does not limit
<br>
the production and availability of music, does not disrupt the economy, and
<br>
does not make us poorer (which is what I believe), then there is no reason
<br>
to call it immoral. The context of music production and delivery is now
<br>
different than three years ago. Our application of ethical reasoning should
<br>
reflect it, even though the underlying moral axioms are unchanged. And, of
<br>
course, budding artists might have to change their expectations about the
<br>
exact amount of money they are going to get for their efforts. Most will
<br>
keep making music anyway. 
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt;Which still doesn't answer what should be done about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-government funded scientific and technical documents, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need much more work to be produced than some crooner's output.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Such content might still require substantial legal protection.
</em><br>
<p>Whats the difference? Isn't information information?
<br>
<p>#### Robert Bradbury answered this question in his post - music takes just a
<br>
few K to produce, and somebody will always keep making it, even if only as a
<br>
hobby or a freebie accompaniment to live performances. Some types of
<br>
technical info can cost literally millions per line to produce and to assure
<br>
that it is produced you need to reward its purveyors handsomely.
<br>
<p>As Robert and Samantha mention, we might need more refined IP laws,
<br>
specifically addressing such disparate areas as databases, music, handbooks,
<br>
open source software, rather than the blunt tools of patent, trademark, and
<br>
copyright law.
<br>
<p>Hal Finney also makes some very important points. In a perfectly transparent
<br>
society, maintaing the copyright laws on music would be easy, and would
<br>
result in the optimal allocation of resources. I agree and I would support
<br>
the creation of such a society but until that happens, the cost of
<br>
maintaining the current law (outlawing the use of PC's, for example) is, as
<br>
Hal says, too high.
<br>
<p>A note to Hal: the content owners should be granted a monopoly on the use
<br>
and copying of their property but only for a limited time - otherwise it
<br>
would amount to granting the license for unlimited income from a limited,
<br>
one-time investment. The time-period of copyright should be strictly limited
<br>
to the time sufficient to generate adequate reimbursement and to assure
<br>
consitent supply of content.
