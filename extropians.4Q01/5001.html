<p>
I share Eliezer's concern about the hostility and intemperance which has
<br>
been a constant undercurrent here since September 11.  This list is no
<br>
place for jingoism or anti-foreign sentiments.  IMO even patriotism is
<br>
inconsistent with Extropian philosophy, being nothing but an updated
<br>
version of old-fashioned tribalism.  This is an international forum.
<br>
The U.S. Constitution or Bill of Rights were not handed down by God,
<br>
they are just one way of forming a society and as Extropians we should
<br>
question them and always look for better.
<br>
<p>At the same time, I see some positive aspects even to harsh and bitter
<br>
messages.  The last thing we want is to adopt a form of political
<br>
correctness as Extropian orthodoxy.  We should have the courage to
<br>
challenge accepted truths.  Sometimes that can't be done without hurting
<br>
people's feelings.  We need to find a way to discuss those issues.
<br>
One approach is to imagine that you are at a small face-to-face
<br>
gathering which includes members of the group you wish to criticize.
<br>
Frank discussion can still include tact and sensitivity.  We can all
<br>
stand to improve our skills in this area.
<br>
<p>Also, I do grant leeway to people who are still reeling in some ways from
<br>
the shock of the 9/11 attacks.  I think many of our posters are reacting
<br>
in fear and anger to what they perceived as an attack on themselves.
<br>
When people feel threatened, they react emotionally.  This is a major
<br>
contributor to the more extreme messages we have seen.  Hopefully future
<br>
readers will understand this as well.
<br>
<p>We should all heed Eliezer's call to look at ourselves from a larger
<br>
perspective.  Don't react to events just as Americans or Australians or
<br>
Caucasians or whatever other tribe you think you belong to.  At the same
<br>
time, don't be afraid to speak up if you disagree with the consensus.
<br>
Be respectful, make your points, and don't try to argue them ad infinitum.
<br>
This way we can have a healthy discussion without veering into either
<br>
extreme of blood feuds or self-censorship.
<br>
