<br>
<p>The SPR is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a government stock of oil
<br>
held to cushion the impact of oil import shutdowns.  We see that the
<br>
total stocks of crude oil are about 850 million barrels, and we import
<br>
about 8.6 million barrels a day, so we have enough in principle for
<br>
about 100 days of oil import cutoffs.  We also have about 25 days worth
<br>
of gasoline production in storage as well.
<br>
<p>Any realistic discussion of avoiding the use of imported oil obviously
<br>
must deal with the costs involved.  The costs will be in two categories,
<br>
short term and long term.  Short term costs relate to the changeover
<br>
period from the current infrastructure to whatever replaces it.  Long term
<br>
costs are those involved in extracting, distributing and using what is
<br>
presumably a more expensive form of energy.
<br>
<p>It seems that there are two general approaches.  One is to attack the
<br>
supply end and try to increase domestic production of oil and similar
<br>
resources like shale oil.  Perhaps alcohol production could play a
<br>
role as well.  It is generally agreed that domestic oil production
<br>
could be greatly increased but at considerable expense.  To roughly
<br>
double production in a time when yields are decreasing would take many
<br>
years of research and expanding facilities, and long term costs will
<br>
be progressively higher as we go forward and oil fields continue to
<br>
be depleted.
<br>
<p>The other is to attack the demand side and work on replacing the uses
<br>
of oil in the economy.  As I said this will take many years as cars
<br>
get replaced, and home and industrial heating units are retired and
<br>
replaced with electrical or natural gas systems.  This approach is
<br>
not really feasible on a short term time frame, and because any crisis
<br>
which would motivate such a transition will be inherently short term,
<br>
it seems unlikely to be pursued.
