<p>
It's finally here!  Extropy Institute's Transhumanist FAQ is now back
<br>
on-line at &lt;<a href="http://extropy.org/faq/">http://extropy.org/faq/</a>&gt;.  It documents the basics of Extropy
<br>
Institute and the Extropian philosophy.
<br>
<p>Note the version number.  It's not finished yet.  We are currently
<br>
re-editing additional sections to cover all different areas of
<br>
transhumanism, futurism, technology, and humanities from an Extropian
<br>
perspective.  We want to specifically address sections on the challenges
<br>
facing us, miscellaneous issues that seem to constantly get discussed, and
<br>
especially the &quot;Next Steps&quot;:  &quot;what do I do now?&quot;, &quot;how do I become more
<br>
involved?&quot;, and &quot;how do I become more extropian in my daily life?&quot;
<br>
<p>Please let me know what you think needs to be added.  If you have a question
<br>
that isn't answered, send it in.  If you previously sent in FAQ materials,
<br>
double-check with me to make sure I have them.  If you have a website,
<br>
white-paper, or oft-repeated answer, send it in.  If you see a wonderful
<br>
answer posted to one of the Lists, point it out to me.  If you are confused
<br>
about some point that has never been made clear, ask us to clarify!
<br>
<p>Or best of all:  Volunteer to write some FAQ answers in your particular area
<br>
of expertise!  We have tons of questions currently being developed, but we
<br>
are sure there are many more.  Why leave it to others when you can make sure
<br>
your favorite question gets answered accurately, correctly and completely?
<br>
