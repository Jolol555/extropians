More on &quot;brain fingerprinting&quot;
<br>
<p>Brain-scans can defeat terrorism, InfoSeek founder claims
<br>
By Thomas C Greene in Washington
<br>
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/22020.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/22020.html</a>
<br>
Just when you thought crowd surveillance with facial recognition gear was the
<br>
sickest idea circulating, some naive do-gooder comes along with 'brain
<br>
fingerprinting' to detect evil memories, loudly urging its use as a public
<br>
security measure in the wake of the 11 September tragedies.
<br>
<p>Steve Kirsch, founder of InfoSeek and current CEO of data management outfit
<br>
Propel Software, reckons that the relevant technology companies could deliver
<br>
a working system of brain fingerprinting databases and a companion retina
<br>
scanning system for (supposedly anonymous) identification reference in
<br>
something like ninety days' time. And this will &quot;infallibly&quot; defeat
<br>
terrorists, he fervently believes.
<br>
<p>How it works
<br>
Kirsch's mental intrusion scheme is based on 'multifaceted
<br>
electroencephalographic response analysis' (MERA), an electronic form of
<br>
phrenology promoted by BrainWave Science company President Larry Farwell,
<br>
whose Gibson-esque self-promoting Web site appears to be little more than a
<br>
gallery of all the dupes he's taken in. These include US Senator Charles
<br>
Grassley (Republican, Iowa), 60 Minutes correspondent Mike Wallace, and a slew
<br>
of newspapers, magazines, and TV and radio producers -- along with our Kirsch.
<br>
<p>The technique has &quot;a record of one-hundred per cent accuracy in research on
<br>
FBI agents, research with US government agencies, and field applications,&quot;
<br>
Farwell gushes.
<br>
<p>He neglects to mention that the FBI trial involved a scant twenty-one test
<br>
subjects, however -- hardly the makings of anything approaching statistical
<br>
significance.
<br>
<p>Farwell also exhibits a Gibson-esque fascination with polysyllabic
<br>
techno-gobbledygook.
<br>
<p>&quot;Words or pictures relevant to a crime are flashed on a computer screen, along
<br>
with other, irrelevant words or pictures. Electrical brain responses are
<br>
measured non-invasively through a patented headband equipped with sensors. A
<br>
specific brain-wave response called a MERMER (memory and encoding related
<br>
multifaceted electroencephalographic response) is elicited when the brain
<br>
processes noteworthy information it recognizes. (The MERMER contains another,
<br>
well known and scientifically established brain response known as a P300.),&quot;
<br>
he tells us.
<br>
<p>&quot;When details of the crime that only the perpetrator would know are presented,
<br>
a MERMER is emitted by the brain of a perpetrator, but not by the brain of an
<br>
innocent suspect. In Farwell Brain Fingerprinting, a computer analyzes the
<br>
brain response to detect the MERMER, and thus determines scientifically
<br>
whether or not the specific crime-relevant information is stored in the brain
<br>
of the suspect.&quot;
<br>
<p>Note the repeated use of the adverb 'scientifically' -- a mannerism much in
<br>
evidence among marketing copywriters, and charlatans.
<br>
<p>Air travel redeemed
<br>
To make the skies safe for Democracy with this kit, Kirsch proposes that &quot;once
<br>
every few years, each person who wishes to travel puts on a headset and
<br>
watches video images for ten minutes. This action allows us to establish a
<br>
'security risk profile' and tie that profile to his iris data.&quot;
<br>
<p>The video images in question would be related to information only praticing
<br>
terrorists would have on file within their brains. The subject's resulting
<br>
'security risk profile' would be associated with his or her retina image so
<br>
that a quick eyeball scan at the airport check in, or the sport stadium
<br>
turnstile, would blow the whistle and they'd be forbidden to enter.
<br>
<p>Poor Kirsch; he seems unable to imagine the diabolical uses to which such
<br>
technology can be put.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's....private because you can control who accesses your data and your data
<br>
is not released to anyone. You just permit your knowledge area to be judged
<br>
against the profile of the place you wish to enter. You get to choose whether
<br>
or not you want to associate your security screening with your name, i.e., you
<br>
can take the test anonymously without providing any identification,&quot; he
<br>
chirps.
<br>
<p>Sure, it can be set up that way (assuming it works as advertised, which we
<br>
kinda doubt); and if that was the limit, it probably wouldn't be all that bad.
<br>
But nothing's going to prevent the government or big business from associating
<br>
personally-identifying data with these profiles one day down the road.
<br>
<p>And nothing's going to prevent other, related applications from emerging. How
<br>
about a tool for employment pre-screening?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Microsoft human resources manager: &quot;We're just going to read you a few
<br>
lines of text and watch how your brain responds:
<br>
1.) 'Bill Gates blows goats'&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Applicant: &quot;I...uh...&quot;
<br>
[Cue siren and dim/raise stage lights once per second]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Microsoft human resources manager: &quot;Thank you so much for your
<br>
interest....&quot;
<br>
<p>Amusing? Not really: how about something extremely nasty, like an
<br>
interrogation tool for penal institutions or in the hands of a repressive
<br>
government? The possibilities are endless, and grotesque.
