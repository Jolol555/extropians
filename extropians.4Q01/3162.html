<p>I disagree. First of all politically it would have been impossible, any president who chose
<br>
a million more American casualties would have been removed from power either by
<br>
impeachment or a military coup. It could even be argued that the terrible damage this new
<br>
weapon could do to a city needed to be demonstrated, and I'm sure it would not have
<br>
slowed Stalin's desire to get a bomb one bit. Indeed things have turned out far better than
<br>
anybody had a right to expect, if I had been alive in September of 1945 I would have said the
<br>
chances The Bomb would not be used in anger again for the remainder of the century were
<br>
virtually zero. Shows you what I know, but it really does seem very improbable, read the
<br>
history of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and you realize how much we owe our existence
<br>
to huge amounts of plain dumb luck. Perhaps the many worlds interpretation could explain
<br>
our ridiculous good fortune, 99.99999% of the worlds blow themselves up as expected and
<br>
we just live in a very rare one that did not. OK, foolish idea, never mind.
<br>
<p>Anyway as I said before I do wish the Nagasaki bombing had at least been delayed for a few
<br>
days to give time for Hiroshima and the USSR entering the war against Japan to sink in,
<br>
and actually it almost happened. Bernard O'Keefe was a technician and he was alone with the
<br>
Nagasaki bomb on the day before it was to go, he was doing a final check. He writes in his book
<br>
&quot;Nuclear Hostages&quot; that he discovered he had made a terrible mistake. Days before he had put
<br>
the firing cable in backward, the male and female plugs were on the wrong ends. The proper way
<br>
to deal with this was clear, the bomb would have to be disassembled, the cable reversed and
<br>
then the bomb reassembled, this would take about a week. But O'Keefe didn't want to be known
<br>
to history as the man who delayed the end of the war by a week. He got a long extension cord
<br>
(no AC outlet was near the bomb for safety reasons) plugged in his soldering iron, unsoldered
<br>
the connectors, reversed them and then resoldered them. This only took about 15 minutes but
<br>
violated every safety rule in the book, once the chemical high explosives were inserted
<br>
into the bomb no electrical current or any source of heat was supposed to come anywhere
<br>
near the bomb, if caught he would have been imprisoned, assuming he wasn't blown up.
<br>
He wasn't blown up, and he told nobody about it until 40 years later when he wrote his book.
<br>
I really wish he'd played by the rules, after a week the war might have been over and
<br>
60,000 people in Nagasaki might not have died.
