<br>
<em>&gt; I only point out that libertarians should be able to explain why some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries have struggled alot harder than other countries under almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical conditions during and since communism fell, and I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that libertarians can explain it without the extra pieces of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information that De Soto's book provides. (my opinion based on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation with Mark)
</em><br>
<p>OK, de Soto sez:
<br>
&lt;&lt;The trouble is that the &quot;mystery of capital,&quot; with its unique
<br>
capacity to regenerate societies by creating liberating wealth,
<br>
never has the chance to operate.
<br>
As de Soto points out, this is because, whether in Egypt or
<br>
Indonesia or for that matter in George Washington's era in U.S.
<br>
history, &quot;They have houses but not titles, crops but not deeds,
<br>
businesses but not statutes of incorporation. And this is why many
<br>
countries seem to be modern, but aren't.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>So they need deeds, titles, and corporate law, otherwise they're not playing
<br>
for keeps. Alright, that makes sense. It's not enough to use money, they also
<br>
need to use a whole new memeplex. Well, don't forget that the West had to go
<br>
through a bunch of revolutions (French, American, Renaisance, etc.) to get
<br>
where it is today. We should expect no less trauma in bringing the Balkans
<br>
into 21st century capitalism. China is still working on the remnants of its
<br>
&quot;cultural revolution&quot; and is predicted by some to become the next economic
<br>
super power, but other parts of the far East are capitalist tigers
<br>
already(Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, etc.), so if they can do it, then so can the
<br>
Balkans. Did de Soto forget that it's not just &quot;the West&quot; that is prospering
<br>
with capitalism? India's on the verge of taking the plunge too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Libertarians should also be able to answer to why, in general, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poorer countries that have the communism yoke lifted now aren't taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off.
</em><br>
<p>How 'bout China? Not taking off? What do you want... everything at Wal Mart is
<br>
made in China.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A glib answer 'that it took communism 70 years to mess up their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country' is unsatisfactory. I'm presenting this, slightly playing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devil's advocate, but more to show that this is a glaring deficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for folks who wish to promote freedom in all its forms. From what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know about De Soto's book, we have a powerful new set of concepts now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we can use to answer the critics, and to change the situation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those countries too.
</em><br>
<p>You've got me there, Amara. I do indeed love glib answers. That's because I've
<br>
noticed that most all  questions are less serious than they pretend.
<br>
<p>de Soto sez:
<br>
&lt;&lt;They have adopted superficial products of capitalist society, but
<br>
not the &quot;representational forms&quot; underlying capitalist societies
<br>
and freeing capital in a &quot;vast hidden process that connects all the
<br>
assets to the rest of the economy&quot; and gives them a &quot;parallel life
<br>
in the creation of new assets.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>... and that's Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else?
<br>
<p>Yes, de Soto continuz:
<br>
&lt;&lt;the real problem is that such countries have yet to establish and normalize
<br>
the invisible network of laws that turns assets from &quot;dead&quot; into &quot;liquid&quot;
<br>
capital. In the West, standardized laws allow us to mortgage a house to raise
<br>
money for a new venture, permit the worth of a company to be broken up into so
<br>
many publicly tradable stocks, and make it possible to govern and appraise
<br>
property with agreed-upon rules that hold across neighborhoods, towns, or
<br>
regions. This invisible infrastructure of &quot;asset management&quot;--so taken for
<br>
granted in the West, even though it has only fully existed in the United
<br>
States for the past 100 years--is the missing ingredient to success with
<br>
capitalism, insists de Soto. But even though that link is primarily a legal
<br>
one, he argues that the process of making it a normalized component of a
<br>
society is more a political--or attitude-changing--challenge than anything
<br>
else.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>So, the answer is: Everyone needs to own their own home. Then they'll have a
<br>
stake in the welfare of their communities. Big deal... any Real Estate
<br>
Principles teacher could have told us that. Why do you think State governments
<br>
provide low interest loans (VA, graduated mortgage, Cal-Vet, FHA, RECD, etc.)
<br>
to potential home buyers? That's right, to encourage home ownership.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [You can be sure that communist-advocates or those against libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas will point to Lithuania's situation and ask why this country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which had so fewer communists is struggling the most out of the three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Baltic countries?]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must look at the layers underneath, i.e. the old and new economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and political infrastructure during communism and after the Fall to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the differences between the rate of economic advancement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the three countries. I'm sure that the book will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out some good reasons, but since I didn't read the book yet, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a still fuzzy unformed picture of the kinds of nodes and networks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are important, I'll stop here.
</em><br>
<p>All we need to understand (and teach formerly communist countries) for
<br>
capitalist success is &quot;asset management.&quot; It's something that way too few
<br>
Americans understand, which is why too many young Americans suffer the
<br>
consequences of enormous credit card debt. (The US economy isn't as healthy as
<br>
your stock broker would like you to believe either.)
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
