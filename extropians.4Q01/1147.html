Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>At the University of Alaska Anchorage they are still planning the guest speaker schedule for the Complexity Science lecture series.  Speakers are flown up from all over, so why not have one from within the Extropian ranks?
<br>
Anders?
<br>
Nick?
<br>
Max?
<br>
Amara?
<br>
Robert?
<br>
Natasha?
<br>
Eliezer?
<br>
Robin?
<br>
Anyone else interested??  We have so many potential candidates on the list.
<br>
<p>I think this is a great opportunity.   
<br>
<p>John

Subject: Complexity Speaker Schedule, Discussion Board, etc
<br>
Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 10:35:19 -0800
<br>
<p>Hello!
<br>
<p>UAA's Complex Systems Group is in an exciting growth stage, and I wanted
<br>
to take this opportunity to bring several items of interest (complexity
<br>
discussion board, a biology presentation, and a schedule of upcoming
<br>
speakers) to your attention.
<br>
<p>New Web Site and Discussion Board
<br>
<p>We are in the process of completely revamping our web site and will move
<br>
the content to more of an educational, rather than informational, focus.
<br>
We hope to be up and running in the near future and will let you know
<br>
when the new site is complete.  I think you'll like the variety of
<br>
articles offered and our Ask an Expert column.
<br>
<p>One of the new features will be a discussion board that will run through
<br>
the University's Blackboard system, which is an online classroom.  The
<br>
open forum will allow you to talk with other members of the complexity
<br>
community re: a wide variety of topics, problems, potential solutions,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Action Item:  Please let me know if you are interested in becoming
<br>
involved in our discussion board and if you have a particular topic or
<br>
question that you'd like to post.  If you are interested, then I'll need
<br>
to provide our Information Technology department with your first name,
<br>
middle initial, last name, and social security number, which will
<br>
provide you with initial access to the discussion board.  You may either
<br>
email this information directly to me at <a href="mailto:ancjw@uaa.alaska.edu?Subject=Re:%20Complexity%20Science%20Speakers%20needed%20for%20lecture%20series&In-Reply-To=&lt;PNDOKECPEPDFIBAA@mailcity.com&gt;">ancjw@uaa.alaska.edu</a>
<br>
mailto:<a href="mailto:ancjw@uaa.alaska.edu?Subject=Re:%20Complexity%20Science%20Speakers%20needed%20for%20lecture%20series&In-Reply-To=&lt;PNDOKECPEPDFIBAA@mailcity.com&gt;">ancjw@uaa.alaska.edu</a>&gt; or you may contact me by telephone at
<br>
907-786-4748.  Your social security number will be assigned as your
<br>
initial password into the Blackboard classroom site; however, you will
<br>
be able to immediately change your password once you enter the system.
<br>
Again, this discussion board will be available to you when our new site
<br>
is finalized (approximately two weeks).
<br>
<p>Biology Presentation--October 19
<br>
<p>Dr. John Pepper of the Santa Fe Institute will present a talk at the UAA
<br>
campus on Friday, October 19, entitled &quot;Agent-Based Modeling of
<br>
Multi-Level Selection:  The Evolution of Feeding Restraint as a Case
<br>
Study.&quot;  This talk is free and is open to the public and will be held
<br>
from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm in the Engineering Building Room 110.
<br>
<p>Presentation synopsis:  Evolutionary biologists are increasingly
<br>
interested in the dynamics of multi-level selection, that is, selection
<br>
acting simultaneously at more than one level in a hierarchy of
<br>
reproducing entities (e.g., gene, chromosome, organelle, cell, organism,
<br>
group, community, ecosystem).  Systems of linear equations are the usual
<br>
tool for studying evolution but may be poorly suited to capturing
<br>
important dynamics of multi-level selection.  Here we use an agent-based
<br>
model to study the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured
<br>
populations.  This work addresses the long-standing controversy over the
<br>
role of &quot;group selection&quot; or natural selection between groups vs. within
<br>
groups of interacting individuals.  In an ecologically plausible
<br>
setting, cooperative individuals with lower rates of food consumption
<br>
compete reproductively against selfish individuals with higher rates of
<br>
consumption.  The results show that changing the spatial distribution of
<br>
food, and thus the distribution of the individuals seeking it, can
<br>
determine whether or not cooperation evolves.  In this model,
<br>
cooperation evolved under a fairly wide range of parameter values, even
<br>
without the kinship effects that are sometimes thought to be necessary.
<br>
We suggest that integrating equation-based analysis tools into
<br>
agent-based models is a powerful way to study selection in systems of
<br>
complex dynamics.
<br>
<p>Brown Bag Complexity Dialogue Luncheons
<br>
<p>We've scheduled the following complexity luncheons on the Anchorage
<br>
campus; please share this information with your peers and co-workers.
<br>
All presentations are free and are open to the public.  The
<br>
presentations will be held on the UAA campus in the Campus Center Room
<br>
105 from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm; please feel free to contact me at
<br>
907-786-4748 if you'd like further information or directions to the
<br>
Campus Center.  Please feel free to bring your lunch to these
<br>
presentations; you may also purchase a sandwich at Subway Sandwiches,
<br>
which is located just across the hall from Room 105.

<br>
<p>We are currently in the process of gathering names and biographies for
<br>
our Spring 2002 Complex Systems Lecture Series, which we hope to
<br>
schedule in late March and throughout the month of April, and we'll keep
<br>
you posted on the latest developments as they become available.  I think
<br>
you can look forward to another exciting season!!
<br>
<p>As always, please feel free to contact me should you require additional
<br>
information, and have a wonderful day.
