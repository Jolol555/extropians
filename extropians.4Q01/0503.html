From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20META:%20List%20Focus&In-Reply-To=&lt;002801c14ee3$4b816b00$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; I like Mark's suggestion for rating posts, but beside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread-handling problem there are also issues of people just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responding without changing the value and similar minor details.
</em><br>
This certainly would be a problem. I suspect that there would not be 100 %
<br>
compliance with the convention:
<br>
As you say, some would not change the E-value of the post where they should.
<br>
Also, I imagine that some may follow the convention but their judgment about
<br>
the appropriate E-value may radically out of whack. However, the convention
<br>
would still be useful if even a few of the regular posters with good
<br>
judgment used the rating system. It would allow one to follow the more
<br>
relevant threads and posts and ignore the others. Also, it is a way of
<br>
continually reinforcing the ideal of the list.
<br>
<em>&gt; Robert has some good points about the general problems with high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume forums, and I think it is worth considering if we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve the list by some extra lists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think Robert's idea is worthy of consideration. Of course there are other
<br>
lists out there already. I suppose we need to ask ourselves what is it that
<br>
makes the Extropian list the worst transhumanist list besides all others. Of
<br>
course Robert's and my suggestions are quite compatible. Although,
<br>
personally I would like to see the list intact. There are so few of us
<br>
already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But these are all technical fixes, and while I like technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixes as much as the next promethean god-wannabee :-) I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will not solve the core problem. The core problem seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more of a social problem: the socialising crowds out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, and the very open forum (and movement) while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoting diversity also promotes lack of focus and consensus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Again, I guess we need to ask ourselves what the socializing component
<br>
brings to the list.What if much of the success of the list was due to this
<br>
socializing component? If memory serves, Anders said there was 31 reasonably
<br>
Extropian posts among 117. I subscribe to three other transhumanist type
<br>
lists, I am pretty sure that they did not have 31 posts among them
<br>
yesterday, never mind 31 reasonably transhumanist posts. I don't mind the
<br>
socializing aspect of this list sometimes, other times I am just too busy.
<br>
What we need is a system that will allow us to separate the 31 from the
<br>
rest. This way the socializing and the more serious purposes of the list may
<br>
peacefully co-exist. The system I have suggested may partly address this
<br>
problem.  Mark
