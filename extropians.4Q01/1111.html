</em><br>
<em>&gt; -------- Original Message --------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: &quot;Jack Brittain&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I ran across a remarkable story last night in the Chronicle of Higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Education. CHE runs a story in every issue on offbeat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research areas. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the October 12 issue there is a story on Lawrence Myers, who is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professor of veterinary medicine at Auburn University. His academic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialty is detector dogs, who are used for drug sniffing, explosives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detection, search and rescue, and other types of smell-based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a funny story about a dog trained for drug detection whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessons were not well structured and ended up being the world's best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nose for finding plastic bags. There is also another story in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article that really struck me as poignant and illustrative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, search and rescue dogs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were used. The teams were searching for survivors, but ultimately they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were finding bodies for removal from the wreckage. After a few days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working the scene, all the dogs quit working. They just would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not get on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; task and were pulling away from the site. Dr. Myers was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called in to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to figure out what was wrong, if there was something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hazardous the dogs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were reacting to, or any other reason they would no longer work. After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking over the dogs and surveying the site, he decided the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dogs were depressed. They were trained to find living people, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they knew they were not finding people alive, they were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding bodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His solution was to enlist some of the volunteers to hide in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wreckage so the dogs could find some people alive. After going through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this exercise, the multiple dogs involved all went back to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work and were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to persist in the body search, although with more frequent breaks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and some sporadic opportunities to experience success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the most hellacious of circumstances, the dogs needed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find a spark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life to keep going. And with nothing more than a moment of hope and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joy, they were able to do the job that had to be done.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Nice one.
