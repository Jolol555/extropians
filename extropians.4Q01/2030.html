<em>&gt; I did a really brief paper this morning on looking at current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and potential future solar wealth.  In large part this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an exercise to see what areas are likely to continue to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources of political trouble due to resource shortages.
</em><br>
<p><p>It would be valuable to include geothermal wealth in that equation.  The
<br>
amount of &quot;cheap&quot; geothermal available world-wide using today's technology
<br>
is estimated to be &gt;10^6 times the total global energy consumption.  While
<br>
the average energy density of good geothermal is about 5,000 times less than
<br>
solar, cheap geothermal tends to be concentrated.  There is a new geothermal
<br>
technology, &quot;hot dry rock&quot; geothermal, which will work anywhere on the
<br>
planet (you just have to drill deep enough) that eventually will allow high
<br>
grade geothermal globally as the technology improves.
<br>
<p>Some countries that have poor solar resources, such as Japan, have very good
<br>
geothermal resources.  IIRC, Japan has already determined that 3% of their
<br>
land is suitable for cheap geothermal technologies with a total generational
<br>
capacity that is somewhere around 5-7 orders of magnitude greater than
<br>
current consumption in Japan.
<br>
<p>The U.S. is the Saudi Arabia of geothermal, having the worlds largest
<br>
high-grade geothermal resevoir (the region between the Rocky and the Sierra
<br>
Nevada mountains inclusive).  MIT has estimated that with conventional
<br>
technology, the geothermal generational capacity of the U.S. is ~3
<br>
Terawatts.  With cheap HDR geothermal, the geothermal capacity of the U.S.
<br>
is in the mid-Petawatt range.  Note that &quot;cheap HDR&quot; is typically defined as
<br>
an HDR resevoir that is 5km deep or less.  In most regions of the world, HDR
<br>
resevoirs are at least 7km deep and in some places, tens of kilometers down.
<br>
In the case of the U.S., it is probably of some value that among the best
<br>
places for solar power harvesting are also the best places for geothermal
<br>
harvesting.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
