<p>I didn't place it in the same category as homeopathy; I placed it in the
<br>
same category as phrenology.  Homeopathy is just a null-op.  If you took
<br>
the facets of personality and intelligence that phrenology allegedly
<br>
measured, you'd probably find high correlations there as well... though,
<br>
of course, no correlation between independent measures of such
<br>
characteristics and the alleged corresponding skull feature.  If you took
<br>
some day's astrology column, removed the dates, and asked people to
<br>
self-select which was their personal prophecy, you might find correlations
<br>
there too, though I wouldn't expect them to be able to pick out the
<br>
allegedly &quot;correct&quot; prophecy at anything other than chance level.  You can
<br>
probably find correlations with favorite television shows, character most
<br>
sympathized with on _Babylon 5_, eating habits, sleep cycles, and clothing
<br>
styles.
<br>
<p>What I disagree with is the idea that this reflects any deep truths about
<br>
human nature, except for the obvious one:  On any graph, people cluster. 
<br>
If someone wants to pick out a nice, full-spectrum range of tests with a
<br>
hundred dimensions and test ten thousand people to study *clustering in
<br>
general*, good for them; that's real science.  Even GAC would be a decent
<br>
project if it were billed as pure investigative science, rather than as
<br>
having something to do with AI, though then they'd have fewer
<br>
contributors.
<br>
<p>But as I see it, the only outcome of reducing the dimensions down to INTJ
<br>
is to let pontificators go on talk shows.
