<p>Governments are a leading cause of death. Espeically when we get on
<br>
the radar of some PC pressure group and they manipulate the machinery
<br>
of state against us in the guise of &quot;ethical concerns&quot; about cryonic
<br>
suspension. Like they did for cloning. And GM food. And animal
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>If your one and only goal is survival, then shouldn't you be giving as
<br>
many different people as many different reasons to pursue course of
<br>
action that will maximize your survival? If you believe we are so easy
<br>
to brainwash, then shouldn't you be attempting to hijack our
<br>
brainwashing and reprogramming us to be memebots singlemindedly
<br>
dedicated to your successful suspension and revival? Even if it means
<br>
pretending to be multicultural and libertarian?
<br>
<p>Then again, perhaps you are a subtler man than that. Perhaps your
<br>
xenophobic trolls are a calculated attempt to jolt us into a direction
<br>
more consistant with your goals. I for one noticed that you've
<br>
succeeded in distracting me from my Bin Satan monomania long enough
<br>
for me to tear myself away from the computer, go shopping, and even do
<br>
a little studying, thereby in a small way aiding the cause of life
<br>
extension.
<br>
<p>Comrade Randy-- madman, genius, or both? All I know is, he's more fun
<br>
to pick on than Bin Bacon, since the latter never writes back. :-)
