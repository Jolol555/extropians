</em><br>
<p>The original post from JR pointed to
<br>
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast26nov_1.htm?list76937">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast26nov_1.htm?list76937</a>
<br>
which had some explanation of the theory.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure I buy it completely though, for several reasons.
<br>
<p>First, as I understand it the theory only works for very large meteors.
<br>
Only those are such that there would be sufficient energy produced in
<br>
the trail to generate enough EM radiation that it could vibrate natural
<br>
objects 50 miles away, loud enough for people to hear.  Not having
<br>
read the literature I'm astonished that this would be possible at all,
<br>
but from reading the web pages it sounds like this is the most favored
<br>
theory.  They claim that such large meteors could generate megawatts of
<br>
EM radiation.
<br>
<p>However I think people sometimes have reported the effect even for
<br>
relatively small meteors like the bulk of the Leonids we saw the other
<br>
night.  These are the size of grains of sand and there is no way they
<br>
could radiate enough EM to be heard through a random natural object, IMO.
<br>
<p>Second, I can't find any references on the web but I remember reading
<br>
years ago another theory, which was that this was a psychoacoustic effect
<br>
related to synesthesia, which is a crossover of sensory modalities.  You
<br>
see a light and under some circumstances you can hear a sound.  Meteors
<br>
are extremely eerie, so sudden, so fast, and so silent.  We are accustomed
<br>
to hearing noises associated with streaks of light, and so there is an
<br>
inherent expectation that meteors ought to make noise.  This can cause the
<br>
illusion of noise in some people.
<br>
<p>I seem to recall reading experiments in darkened rooms where streaks of
<br>
light are projected on the ceiling to imitate meteors, and some people
<br>
reported sounds.
<br>
<p>Third, why are there no recordings of these meteor sounds?  The Leonids
<br>
for the last couple of years (and next year as well) would be excellent
<br>
candidates.  Build some antennas that ought to turn these waves into
<br>
sound, and put a microphone next to them.  That would go a long way
<br>
towards proving the theory.  AFAIK this has not been done, which makes
<br>
me skeptical.  (Note, there are web pages with &quot;meteor sounds&quot;, but
<br>
these are electronically detected; I mean an acoustic recording.)
