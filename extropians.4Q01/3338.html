<p>I pointed out the problem with the source of cells they were using.
<br>
To get blood borne stem cells you have to use a cell sorter which
<br>
is a pretty expensive piece of equipment.  You probably also have
<br>
to go through a slew of patent rights various groups have on their
<br>
isolation.  To get intestinal crypt stem cells, I expect you would
<br>
need a needle biopsy through the abdomen -- much more invasive and
<br>
potentially risky than a skin punch.  Obviously neuronal stem cells
<br>
are even *more* difficult.
<br>
<p>This isn't going to get to be a &quot;breakthrough&quot; until one figures
<br>
out how to deprogram differentiated cells (if it is even feasible).
<br>
Otherwise you have to figure out the easiest way to get the least
<br>
differentiated material out of the body and determine the markers
<br>
that you can use to determine that you really have what you really
<br>
want.
<br>
<p>Its going to take a lot more work in the trenches I fear.
<br>
<p>I think the timing of the work might be fortuitous however.
<br>
Congress has a lot on its plate right now (cranking out the
<br>
pork in the anti-recession bill), so the Senate may not get
<br>
back to cloning this year.
