<em>&gt;as a Parfitian which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would you prefer: a) To live another say 50 years (a &quot;normal&quot; life
</em><br>
span), or
<br>
<em>&gt;b) die tomorrow and be replaced by an identical copy that will 1000
</em><br>
years?
<br>
<em>&gt;(Obviously, for some functionalist at least the choice is simply
</em><br>
whether to
<br>
<em>&gt;live 50 or 1000 years. I have phrased the question so as not to beg the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question against Parfitians et. al). I think most of us, no matter
</em><br>
where we
<br>
<em>&gt;fall on the continuum you outline would take b, although I would be
</em><br>
curious
<br>
<em>&gt;to hear from those that would take a. 
</em><br>
<p>I've got to agree with Damien on this one. 50 years sounds better than dying
<br>
tomorrow. 
<br>
<p>Why? Because I have a big attachment to &quot;me&quot;, whatever that is, but as to
<br>
patterns of atoms and/or information which are strongly or even exactly 
<br>
like me? I couldn't care less. Well, I'd probably actually care a bit about
<br>
most other people out there (I really do like people a lot), but there are
<br>
limits.
