Japanese automaker Honda shows upgraded walking, talking robot
<br>
<a href="http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/01/11/12/story6117&sec=business">http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/01/11/12/story6117&sec=business</a>
<br>
TOKYO (AP) - Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co. on Monday showed an upgraded
<br>
version of its walking humanoid robot Asimo that can recite programmed phrases
<br>
and maneuver on stairways better than its predecessors.
<br>
<p>The robot has also become much easier to operate than earlier models,
<br>
requiring just four minutes to start running, down from the previous 40
<br>
minutes, Honda said. The robot had already been able to walk and do a little
<br>
dance, but the upgraded model has more detailed, flexible movements and can
<br>
turn on slopes.
<br>
<p>Voice-recognition technology previously contained in a separate personal
<br>
computer is now installed inside its body.
<br>
<p>The machine also now has an electronic voice of its own and can be programmed
<br>
to remember about 100 different responses.
<br>
<p>The robot appears on Honda's TV advertisements, promotional videos and shows
<br>
up at events such as the recent Tokyo auto show. Honda plans to rent out the
<br>
latest model for 20 million yen (dlrs 166,000) a year. It has already received
<br>
three orders - including from IBM Japan, which plans to use the robot as a
<br>
receptionist.
<br>
<p>Honda is prepared to rent up to about 10 robots but only in Japan. The latest
<br>
robot stands 120 centimeters (four feet) tall and weighs 52 kilograms (114
<br>
pounds), slightly heavier than the previous model at 43 kilograms (95 pounds).

<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
