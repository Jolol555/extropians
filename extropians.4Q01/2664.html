Freedom Reigns in Kabul
<br>
by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<br>
from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/kabul.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/kabul.html</a>
<br>
<p>Sweet liberty! The Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Hazaras, under the courageous
<br>
leadership of Mohammad Fahim, Abdullah Abdullah, Abdul Rashid Dostum, and
<br>
Yunis Qanoni, have taken control of Kabul and sent the Pashtuns, organized
<br>
under the auspices of the Islamo-fascist Taliban and its dastardly duce
<br>
Mullah Mohammad Omar, fleeing for the hills.
<br>
<p>Though the Pashtuns vow they will rise again in the South, those of us who
<br>
understand Afghan history, thanks to recent newspaper accounts, know that
<br>
this is just typical Pashtun talk. My, what a descent for Omar, who only six
<br>
years ago was cheered by the world community for unseating Burhanuddin
<br>
Rabbani and publicly castrating the aging Soviet puppet Muhammad
<br>
Najibullah - who once governed with the help of Pushtan, Uzbek, and even
<br>
Tajik assistance - leaving him hanging for days. Well, power corrupts, you
<br>
know.
<br>
<p>May Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, the heralded United Nations envoy, put
<br>
together a government under the wise leadership of aging King Mohammad Zaher
<br>
Shah, who can only hope he won't be seen as another puppet. But it could be
<br>
tough: from evidence so far, the Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Hazaras seem intent on
<br>
looting and slaying every Pashtun and Pashtun ally in sight, whether Arab,
<br>
Pakistani, or Chechan. Well, to the victor go the spoils, or what's left of
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>It's true that identical coups in Kabul (just switch the tribal names
<br>
around) have been staged in April 1978, December 1979, February 1989, April
<br>
1992, and September 1996, and one wonders whether the cycle of tribal
<br>
warfare that has lasted millennia until just now will finally end.
<br>
<p>Such details can be ironed out later. For now, let us celebrate the stunning
<br>
triumph, which is due, in no small part, to the steadfastness of Pakistani
<br>
military dictator Pervez Musharraf, who, though despised by most of his
<br>
citizens, is a loyal friend of the US, and has been promised billions in
<br>
debt relief as guaranteed by US taxpayers.
<br>
<p>All this I understand. But I do have one question: what would George
<br>
Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and their contemporaries think? It's true that
<br>
our nation's pundit class knows far less about the founding American tribe
<br>
(called Americans) than they do about the ones currently battling for
<br>
control of Afghanistan. But though they lived long ago, these men did offer
<br>
some thoughts that might help us through the current foreign-policy fog.
<br>
<p>The founding generation knew the history of European politics well; its
<br>
unending cycles of ethnic, territorial, and religious disputes, and
<br>
constantly shifting alliances. Jefferson denounced all this as &quot;the throes
<br>
and convulsions of the ancient world.&quot; So long as kings could start wars to
<br>
maintain and secure their grip on the population, freedom of the kind the
<br>
founding generation imagined possible stood no chance. As intractable as
<br>
these wars were, of course, they paled by comparison with the relentless
<br>
bloodshed of the Continent's neighbors to the East, which had not even
<br>
developed a tradition in which religion and state had separate identities.
<br>
<p>So the founding generation had an idea. An ocean on either side separated us
<br>
from old world feuds. It was possible and indeed necessary to engage in
<br>
peaceful commercial exchange, but it was not necessary to import the hatreds
<br>
and wars of the old world. This would be the New World, where liberty would
<br>
reign supreme.
<br>
<p>Thomas Jefferson put it this way:
<br>
<p>&quot;Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of
<br>
one quarter of the globe; too high-minded to endure the degradations of the
<br>
others; possessing a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to
<br>
the thousandth and thousandth generation; entertaining a due sense of our
<br>
equal right to the use of our own faculties, to the acquisitions of our own
<br>
industry, to honor and confidence from our fellow-citizens, resulting not
<br>
from birth, but from our actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a
<br>
benign religion, professed, indeed, and practiced in various forms, yet all
<br>
of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love of
<br>
man; acknowledging and adoring an overruling Providence, which by all its
<br>
dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and his
<br>
greater happiness hereafter-with all these blessings, what more is necessary
<br>
to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing more,
<br>
fellow-citizens-a wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from
<br>
injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own
<br>
pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of
<br>
labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government, and this
<br>
is necessary to close the circle of our felicities.&quot;
<br>
<p>After noting that states rights is the domestic foundation of good
<br>
government, Jefferson summed up American foreign policy as follows:
<br>
&quot;commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with
<br>
none.&quot;
<br>
<p>He was only echoing George Washington, who had urged us to:
<br>
<p>&quot;Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace and
<br>
harmony with all... The nation which indulges towards another a habitual
<br>
hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to
<br>
its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it
<br>
astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against
<br>
another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold
<br>
of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when
<br>
accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence, frequent
<br>
collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, prompted
<br>
by ill-will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the government, contrary
<br>
to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in
<br>
the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would
<br>
reject; at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to
<br>
projects of hostility instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and
<br>
pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of
<br>
nations, has been the victim.... The great rule of conduct for us in regard
<br>
to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with
<br>
them as little political connection as possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>That said, let us continue the celebration of the victory of the Uzbeks,
<br>
Tajiks, and Hazaras, over the hated Pashtuns, and may our friends and
<br>
enemies forever keep changing so that our foreign-policy fun may never end,
<br>
and prosperity and peace never come to the Middle East. Jefferson and
<br>
Washington were interesting guys, but their ideas just don't engage the
<br>
nationalist imagination.
