</em><br>
<p>Well, he seems to be of the sort who already call themselves
<br>
'posthumans': their emphasis is entirely focused on the individual
<br>
'spiritual' or philosophical development. However, he does suffer from
<br>
at least one wrong assumption, to whit:
<br>
<p>&quot;Transhumanism is the philosophy that states 'Life is beyond our
<br>
control'. They predict an inevitable state of rapid technological
<br>
change, during which there is no predicting what will happen next. This
<br>
view of having no control over the fate of the universe itself is key to
<br>
validating their most cherished beliefs of freedom, individual rights,
<br>
and happiness.&quot;
<br>
<p>The writer erroneously conflates the ability to predict the future with
<br>
being able to 'control' it, as well as erroneously confusing the
<br>
viewpoint of the present with that of the future: i.e. just because WE,
<br>
at the present time, may not be able to control the future does not mean
<br>
that we, in the future, will not be able to control it. Another bad
<br>
assumption of the writer is that 'control' is something which is
<br>
desirable.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is the philosophy which states that we, as individuals,
<br>
have the ability to control our own future, to create a better future at
<br>
an ever increasing rate, and that as the human animal has evolved since
<br>
its beginning as a technological animal, that technology is the
<br>
preeminent (though not necessarily exclusive) means by which we will
<br>
achieve it.
<br>
<p>&quot;But maybe it is not so much a particular set of beliefs that defines
<br>
the transhumans as much as a certain conformity or lack of resistance to
<br>
those memes that happen to be popular in our era.&quot;
<br>
<p>Where the writer gets this idea I can't conceive. We all tend to be
<br>
rather highly resistant to memes which are popular in our era (with the
<br>
exception of those which are popular specifically because of our work).
<br>
We are generally resistant to superstitions of all kinds, especially
<br>
religion, while the rest of society seems to be suffering from a
<br>
backlash of superstitious revivalism.
<br>
<p>&quot;The only relevant way in which they distinguish themselves as a group
<br>
is their belief that spectacular technological breakthroughs will occur
<br>
within their lifetime. This is, in my view, a distinct possibility;
<br>
however, the idea of imminent uncontrollable change has no substantial
<br>
benefit in promoting progress.&quot;
<br>
<p>That 'control' meme of his, again, seems to be his primary peeve. He
<br>
also seems to suffer from a non-standard definition of what exactly
<br>
'progress' is, and is completely ignorant of the work of Kurzweil et al
<br>
in demonstrating how change is the lone significant contributor to
<br>
promoting progress in human life.
<br>
<p>&quot;Instead of striving to create progress oneself, one merely keeps up
<br>
with an inevitable technological race. It is no better than watching TV
<br>
in that the outcome is already predetermined, and one's reason for
<br>
involving oneself is for personal satisfaction, the pursuit of
<br>
feelings.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ah, now accusing us of being trapped by 'feelings' rather than logic and
<br>
rationality. I really don't see at all now where this person is getting
<br>
his ideas, unless he's been assuming that the emotive relativists seen
<br>
here occasionally (and on the &gt;H list more generally) are 'true'
<br>
transhumanists or extropians.
<br>
<p>Now, where he does have a point is that there has not been a lot of
<br>
'new' thinking in a while. We've been fleshing out ideas, delving into
<br>
that idea space created years ago to greater depth and color, with a
<br>
more critical eye, but we are, in fact, limited in what we can forsee by
<br>
the conceptual limits of the singularity. Some, like Vinge, Egan, and
<br>
Broderick, can go beyond this in highly speculative ways, but the
<br>
problem with this is not that it is impossible, but that there is a
<br>
significant barrier between what is considered by science to be
<br>
'rational speculation' and outright fantasy. The fact that we have this
<br>
sense of a conceptual limit within us is due to the scientist within us.
<br>
<p>It seems, though, in the end, that the writer's primary peeves, outside
<br>
of his need for 'control', is that he dislikes the degree to which we
<br>
commonly accept ideas like the free market (one of those other things
<br>
which is highly resistant to 'control'), individual liberty over
<br>
community need, and the very idea that technology is good.
<br>
<p>We are generally oriented toward 'individual liberty', an orientation
<br>
which smacks squarely against the writer's evident peruile need for
<br>
'control'. It is because of this fascist/statist orientation of his that
<br>
he is most certainly an 'anti-transhumanist', or at least an
<br>
anti-extropian. He is a Borganist, and therefore the arch enemy  of any
<br>
extropian. Fortunately he admits it right here:
<br>
<p>&quot;I am merely stating what is obvious to everyone, and so it is not
<br>
surprising that even popular science fiction depicts exactly what I am
<br>
saying. I am specifically referring to the Borg, who strive for
<br>
perfection through the elimination of individuality and diversity. Out
<br>
of all species depicted in Star Trek, the Borg alone have a logical
<br>
philosophy and a reasonable approach to life.&quot;
<br>
<p>The fact that he disregards the logical philosophy and stoic beauty of
<br>
the Vulcans, the hyper-rationality and amusing joy of the Q (who are the
<br>
real only species which is truly posthuman in nature in the show), as
<br>
well as the logical and rational Data, the android, who goes through
<br>
life striving to be more than he is, is evidence enough that the writer
<br>
is the one who has 'a certain conformity' of outlook, a rather limited
<br>
perception of what progress actually is.
<br>
<p>He then exposes that not only is he a proto-Borganist, but that he also
<br>
embraces the idea that the need for consensual ethical control is more
<br>
important than progress itself:
<br>
<p>&quot;Control is more important than speed. Present society is postponing the
<br>
question of how technology is to be used, and merely produces it. That
<br>
there is someone somewhere who is willing to pay for it is enough. In a
<br>
microcompetitively evolving society, immediate rewards are favored over
<br>
long-term ones. Freedom, individual rights, and justice are symptoms of
<br>
poor organization and lack of strategy. As long as the majority believes
<br>
that ethical rules are needed, we are not ready to go through a period
<br>
of great technological upheaval. For ethics clumsily tries to keep in
<br>
check opposing interests. And overcoming the need for ethics requires no
<br>
technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>First off, I'll point out the writer's obession with control. He doesn't
<br>
understand that society determines how technology is to be used by the
<br>
means of market mechanics. He evidently does not accept the precept that
<br>
'the market will decide'. His blanket dismissal of individual rights in
<br>
toto in favor of 'organization' and 'strategy' (i.e. control) identifies
<br>
him squarely as a fascist.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, he further doublespeaks, by conflating his belief as that
<br>
which 'the majority believes'.
<br>
<p>Finally, I find the following most amusing:
<br>
<p>&quot;Feedback Form (disabled)&quot;
<br>
<p>Sure, he wants you to think he's interested in your opinion, but he
<br>
really isn't.... ;)
