&quot;Nothing beats science...yet&quot;
<br>
<p>A lovely/most concise definition of the scientific method!
<br>
Send me a gross of bumper stickers now.
<br>
<p>In considering this thread I found a small trend that seemed to suggest that
<br>
it is possible to absolutely 'nail' facts. It seems to me that facts about
<br>
the natural world can never completely be known, only theorised about and
<br>
modelled to ever increasing levels of demonstrable certainty. A handy
<br>
classifier for my simple brain is
<br>
<p>FACTS:	Aspects of reality.
<br>
TRUTH:	Facts as observed and subsequently reported OR held to be true (=
<br>
beliefs)
<br>
<p>Facts about the natural world are everywhere. Truth is a human construct and
<br>
falls over at the first moment the demand &quot;Prove it&quot; leaves you wondering.
<br>
Describing/defining facts perfectly at all levels may be the only thing in
<br>
the universe I believe (here's my truth- and I can't prove it!) may be
<br>
impossible. I actually find this comforting---lots of stuff to find out
<br>
forever.
<br>
<p>This leads me to a poem I wrote recently. It alludes to the above. None of
<br>
my family/friends get it, but I think you guys will. I am yet another
<br>
critter writing a sci fi novel and this is what it's about....
<br>
<p>King tide of thought reshapes Wheeler's beach
<br>
Surf's wane and new foot prints
<br>
Skirt discarded meme moguls,
<br>
Parsing shards of yesterday's riddles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the dunes I can view shadows of conjecture shoals,
</em><br>
Guess the horizon of promise,
<br>
follow beckoning breezes into point of folly
<br>
and low wide bight of plausibility
<br>
fashioned by the rationals in their quest.
<br>
<p>The armies of sleepy people know nought of the shore
<br>
In their torpid blindness
<br>
Though they be where the shore once was.
<br>
Oblivious that what was once beyond it
<br>
now runs their lives.
<br>
<p>Sparse few on the beach,
<br>
shoulders to the future
<br>
talk in pictures hoping the sleepy folk
<br>
will leave them be.
<br>
<p>An answer is a thousand questions
<br>
A question is a candle to a cavern
<br>
And to taste the lapping waters of the shore
<br>
is sweet lunch with everyone's God
<br>
at Wheeler's beach
<br>
<p><p>My urge to share is now sated.....back to quantum computing and brains.
<br>
<p>cheers
