I was re-reading Greg Egan's fascinating novel Diaspora, which is about
<br>
the response of an uploaded future humanity to a major galactic threat.
<br>
Early in the novel two of the characters, Yatima and Inoshiro, transfer
<br>
themselves into robot bodies and go to visit a colony of &quot;fleshers&quot;,
<br>
non-uploaded humans.  Walking through the jungle they stumble across
<br>
an empty canister of &quot;Replicator&quot;, which they view as dangerous and
<br>
threatening.  But I can't figure out what this stuff is.  It doesn't
<br>
seem to match any of the dangerous future materials we have discussed.
<br>
Here is the description:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatima heard something skid across the ground in front of ver; ve'd
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inadvertantly kicked a small pipece of corroded metal out from under
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a shrub.  Ve kept walking, but Inoshiro paused to examine it, then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cried out in alarm.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Replicator!&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatima turned baqck and angled for a better view; the interface made
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vis body crouch.  &quot;It's just an empty canister.&quot;  It was almost crushed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flat, but there was still paint clinging to the metal in places,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the colors faded to barely distinguishable grays.  Yatima could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make out a portion of a narrow, roughly longitudinal band of varying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width, slightly paler than its background; it looked to ver like a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two-dimensional representation of a twisted ribbon.  There was also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of a circle - though if it was a biohazard warning, it didn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look much like the ones ve recalled from vis limited browsing on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the subject.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inoshiro spoke in a hushed, sickened voice.  &quot;Pre-Introdus, this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was pandemic.  Distorted whole nations' economies.  It had hooks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into everything: sexuality, tribalism, half a dozen artforms and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subcultures...  it parasitized the fleshers so thoroughly you had to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be some kind of desert monk to escape it.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatima regarded the pathetic object dubiously, but they had no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;access to the library now, and vis knowledge of the era was patchy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Even if there are traces left inside, I'm sure they're all immune
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to it by now.  And it could hardly infect us -&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inoshiro cut ver off impatiently.  &quot;We're not talking nucleotide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viruses, here.  The molecules themselves were just a random assortment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of junk - mostly phosphoric acid; it was the memes they came wrapped
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in that made them virulent.&quot;  Ve bent down lower, and cupped vis hands
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the battered container.  &quot;And who knows how small a fragment it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can bootstrap from?  I'm not taking any chances.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ha! I typed this all in, and then I finally figured out what it is.  A
<br>
pretty good joke.
<br>
