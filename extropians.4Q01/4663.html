IMO, this would only prove that the subject experience something. It would be no evidence of an afterlife or god or anything outside our current 
<br>
scientific knowledge.
<br>
<p>Such an evidence would be for example if the subject could communicate with each other or with other entities during the experience _and_ prove this 
<br>
communication afterwards. They have to bring back something (knowledge?) that they didn't have before and that can be shown to others.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I TOTALLY AGREE with your demand for evidence!!  If you, myself, and several others all agreed we interacted with each other and had many specific details in common, I would find that rather conclusive evidence.  
<br>
<p>But, ONLY if we are awakened in separate quarters and then interviewed to gather up all the details of the person's experience.  This would avoid story &quot;cross-contamination.&quot;  
<br>
<p>At this point I don't see how an unbiased observer could write the experiment off.  Unless they claimed there had been fraud, or a &quot;mass hallucination.&quot;  I would invite the observer to join the next group to go through the process. lol!  Right Damien?? ;)  
<br>
<p>you continued:
<br>
Nice idea, btw. I think I would volunteer under certain circumstances.
<br>
(end)

<p>Kai, you must be a brave man.  I think I am brave enough, but I would do it through gritted teeth.  Should my great-uncle leave his vast fortune to me(lol!) I will remind you of your willingness to volunteer!  Before going ahead with that I would make all of Alcor's dreams come true.  
<br>
<p>Anyway, it would be hard to get a top flight medical team for such an unorthodox experiment.  If only I had the money...
<br>
<p>best wishes,
