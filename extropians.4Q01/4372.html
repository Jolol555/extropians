Dunno if I am a visualizer per se or not.  I know that I don't
<br>
see visual images in my head
<br>
for a lot of types of problems and situations that some of my
<br>
friends do.  I can do that
<br>
to some degree but it seems relatively limited.  What I tend to
<br>
do more is build complex
<br>
multi-dimensional models in my head that I don't so much &quot;see&quot;
<br>
as envelop and fly all around 
<br>
and, well, &quot;be&quot;.  I do a lot of soaring in and out of mental
<br>
spaces representing things I am working
<br>
on. This usually works just fine but it seems different from
<br>
some of the visualizers
<br>
I know.  I partially visualize and did it more when I was
<br>
younger.  I used to remember who
<br>
wrote books because I could always pull them off my mental shelf
<br>
and look at the cover.  But that
<br>
pretty much disappeared.  I can't construct a mental visual
<br>
image all that well at all.  I find
<br>
myself instead piecing it together from mathematical
<br>
abstractions as I crawl/fly/feel along it. I
<br>
usually have a fast enough brain to do ok at that but in some
<br>
branches of mathematics it doesn't
<br>
work well.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit more about this range, and took it into account. I frequently rant on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about my own, um, cognitive anomaly (or variant), but here I go again:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was regarded as a real dope at school, and when I was 12 got shifted out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an `academic' Jesuit school to a crappy `technical school' (woodwork,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rudimentary machine shop, etc), where I proved even less competent. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect that I might be the only PhD ever to emerge from its dark Satanic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mills... :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The key to this weird misdiagnosis of stupidity is likely to be my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inability to form mental visual images. I can eventually get most places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others can reach, but I have to do it by clawing up the walls with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fingernails (speaking of fingers). (Yet I *dream* in full color images.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The epiphany that set me free happened at the end of my first year at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university, when I abruptly grokked that when tutors and lecturers and text
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books kept going on about `poetic images' they *meant* it... at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes. The everyday experience of perceptual hallucinations stood at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ground level of the metaphor. *Fuck, people SEE things in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HEADS??* You've gotta be *joking*!! I ripped into some psych literature and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found there was a body of evidence on this variation in mental modality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cognitive mapping and mental imagery studies were not yet fashionable, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for decades yet), but no educators seemed to have noticed. I went to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English prof and said I'd like to do research in this area. He looked down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his nose and said with a sniff that in that case I might wish to change my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major to... (yuck)... psychology. NOT THE POINT, d00D, I wanted to shout,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I was far too polite in those days. I'm not sure much has changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since. (Although postmodernist approaches to the text would eschew anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as crass and literally minded as image-like imagery; even so, the shared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *experience* of mental imagery probably underpins most enthusiasm for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading fiction and poetry. Is this true of sf readers? We like gaudy or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numinously cosmic settings, but I wonder if the tendency to *actual*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visualizations--in comix, magazine illos, special FX movies, rendered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games, etc--might reflect an appeal to a lot of people who like the ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but *don't* autonomously roll their own images.)
