Nice summary of the various philosophical positions!
<br>
<em>&gt; Parfitians (myself included) tend to agree with some functionalists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with John, saying that an identical copy of me is not me.
</em><br>
However,
<br>
<em>&gt; we are actually closer to John in that we don't think that identity is
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; matters. What matters is psychological connectedness and continuity. So,
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; practice, we are pretty close to John's view. I would not be happy about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being destroyed while my life was taken over by a copy made weeks before I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was destroyed, but I would far prefer than to destruction and no copying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The more you cut down the overlap, the less disturbed I would be. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't activate the copy until after I'm gone, I find it hard to see what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It is interesting to see how far a healthy pragmatism would allow us to
<br>
close the gap here on various positions. For example, as a Parfitian which
<br>
would you prefer: a) To live another say 50 years (a &quot;normal&quot; life span), or
<br>
b) die tomorrow and be replaced by an identical copy that will 1000 years?
<br>
(Obviously, for some functionalist at least the choice is simply whether to
<br>
live 50 or 1000 years. I have phrased the question so as not to beg the
<br>
question against Parfitians et. al). I think most of us, no matter where we
<br>
fall on the continuum you outline would take b, although I would be curious
<br>
to hear from those that would take a. (I think the protagonist in John
<br>
Perry's _A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality_ might take a,
<br>
however, I would be interested in hearing good reasons.:)) In any event,
<br>
this may suggest that identity might be over-rated in some cases.
