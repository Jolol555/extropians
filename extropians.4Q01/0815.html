I'm guessing the definition of &quot;disease&quot; may have both a legal (or
<br>
institutional) and scientific definition, one could say that aging is or is
<br>
not &quot;disease&quot; depending on the context.
<br>
<p>Could one say aging is not a &quot;disease&quot; and be correct, even if scientific
<br>
consensus shows otherwise if  it is not legally (institutionally) recognized
<br>
as true?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders made this comment (in the Meritocracy thread), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm relocating it back to the aging discussion for the sake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of archive continuity:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do we have any question that Laura Bradbard from the FDA has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; done the extensive survey that Robert Freitas has done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to begin a rational classification of what &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a &quot;disease&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders replied:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, I think she is basing her statement on a long debate in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; community of medical philosophers that has largely reached a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like this. She might not have come up with it on her own, but it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result of quite some thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the problem is that the foundation on which thinking has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been done is shifting rapidly.  This is pointed out by the recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article by James Hughes in the Journal of Evolution and Technology:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Future of Death: Cryonics and the Telos of Liberal Individualism&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume6/death.htm">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume6/death.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the site appears offline right now unfortunately)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Alternate: <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Articles/death.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Articles/death.html</a>]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Its a good article, I highly recomend it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In fact, Robert is the lone outsider I think most medical philosophers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would regard as badly informed and educated. We might agree with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; views and think they make sense, but to convince the rest of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; involved in this issue requires a lot of writing and debating, extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and refining the ideas enormously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to trust that when Robert &quot;surveys&quot; something he does a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detailed job of it.  While Nanomedicine does not go into the history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some of these concepts in detail, I expect the cited references do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now of course there probably only a few dozen to a few hundred people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alive on the planet familiar enough with that body of literature to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss it productively, so I doubt the concepts will move forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as rapidly as we might desire.  As the Hughes article points out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;biofundamentalists&quot; are going to be very resistant to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is coming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
