</em><br>
<p>No, I did not. Once again, you are making inaccurate assumptions.
<br>
<p>It is impossible to determine who is and is not a member of such
<br>
secretive groups without detaining and questioning those who fit the
<br>
profile of members of such groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Every white person? Every white christian person? Every person of his home
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, of course... and the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor were just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;lunatics&quot; like Timothy McVeigh, right? ...and just because some &quot;lunatic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Germans bombed Europe and murdered millions of Jews, that was no excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Allies to try to take out Hitler and his minions, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you studiously missing the point?
</em><br>
<p>No, you seem to be. Given that over most of the past decade, white males
<br>
HAVE been 'the enemy' as far as those in power were concerned, then it's
<br>
not an inaccurate point.
<br>
<p>The crime about the Japanese detention during WWII was not so much that
<br>
they were detained, but that their private property was seized, stolen,
<br>
and auctioned off by the state without compensation. There was the issue
<br>
of detaining natural born citizens who were children of Japanese
<br>
immigrants. Under the Geneva Conventions, detention of foreign nationals
<br>
is entirely legal, provided they are treated humanely and their property
<br>
is respected.
<br>
<p>What bugs me is that those who harp on things like our detention of the
<br>
Japanese have absolutely nothing to day about how the Japanese treated
<br>
OUR citizens (and those of Britain, Australia, etc) who were
<br>
non-combatants within Japanese control. They property was confiscated,
<br>
stolen, or destroyed, and they more often than not died in detention
<br>
from torture or maltreatment, yet you never see any of these whining
<br>
liberals ever protesting outside the Japanese Embassy anywhere demanding
<br>
reparations for families and survivors of their mistreatment of western
<br>
civilians during the war. The Japanase government has never apologized
<br>
for this treatment, generally denies that it took place in their history
<br>
books, and has never paid a dime to the survivors or their families, and
<br>
our government prevents our citizens from suing the Japanese over this.
