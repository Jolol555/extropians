<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;[White House spokesman Ari] Fleischer used the Maher controversy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;issue this creepy Orwellian pronouncement: &quot;Americans need to watch what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they say, watch what they do, and this is not a time for remarks like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that; there never is.&quot; (Creepier still, someone in the White House then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;took scissors to the official transcript of Fleischer's remarks to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them less chilling.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The controversy about Maher concerns me.  All he said was that, contrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to W's claims, flying a plane into a building is a brave act (however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heinous),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while shooting cruise missles from 2 countries away is the cowardly action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's absolutely right; it just points out that (to paraphrase Jon Clark)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bravery is an overrated virtue and cowardliness an overrated vice. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fleischer who should be cashiered; demanding that the whole country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must always fall in with Orwell-speak is frightening and inexcuseable.
</em><br>
<p>This conflict reflects the problems moral philosophers have with the
<br>
trolley death paradox: given a choice between 5 people dying on one
<br>
track, or flipping a switch that will only kill one person, versus 5
<br>
people dying in the trolley accident if you refuse to shove one person
<br>
in front of the train, most people will look at flipping the switch as a
<br>
more moral choice than shoving someone in front of the trolley, despite
<br>
the equal cost in lives lost versus lives saved.
<br>
<p>Maher is saying that purposely crashing four airplanes full of generally
<br>
pacifistic people into buildings full of pacifistic people is more
<br>
courageous than purposely dropping cruise missiles from 2000 miles away
<br>
on a country full of highly skilled warriors who love little else but
<br>
warring and mayhem in very personal in your face circumstances...
