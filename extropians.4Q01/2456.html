</em><br>
<p><p>Here's an explanation, courtesy of William of Occam.  
<br>
<p>Television has hyped this whole affair way out of
<br>
proportion.  
<br>
<p>The FBI and CIA were asleep at the wheel, allowing one
<br>
megalomaniacal cultural-extremist fanatic, born to
<br>
self-importance and anomalous wealth, to create a
<br>
terrorist organization with a substantial degree of
<br>
competence.  The FBI and CIA should have been watching
<br>
and weren't.  The rest of the US wasn't watching
<br>
because it wasn't their job.  The terrorists did their
<br>
thing, caught us by surprise, scored way big in the
<br>
category of television drama , and the US took a hit.
<br>
<p>But guess what didn't happen next?  The great Muslim
<br>
uprising.  The great Muslim uprising, led by
<br>
Osama-the-Great,
<br>
Osama-the-new-Mohammed-savior-of-Islam, fizzled,
<br>
when--surprise, surprise--the rest of the world proved
<br>
unimpressed by the deluded ambition of a
<br>
self-important, over-priviledged, fundamentalist
<br>
fanatic.
<br>
<p>Now, the net is closing, and Osama, in his
<br>
desperation, is trying to frighten those who are
<br>
coming after him.  
<br>
<p>So the answer is, that he has no nukes, no chemical
<br>
weapons, no bioweapons, and, since Sept 11th, no more
<br>
element of surprise.  Just box cutters and a cadre of
<br>
culturally brain-damaged suicidal superlosers.
<br>
<p>Islam is a museum piece, which long ago condemned
<br>
itself to irrelevance and memetic morbidity by
<br>
renouncing progress in favor of the stagnation of
<br>
theocratic authoritarianism.  And fundamentalist
<br>
Islam, like other forms of fundamentalism, is little
<br>
more than a cult of death, a cult of bitter old men,
<br>
who hate all that they have lost: youth, originality,
<br>
energy, and a love of the promises of life.
<br>
<p>I'm gonna stick my neck out and predict that Al Quaida
<br>
will fold with a whimper.   
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
