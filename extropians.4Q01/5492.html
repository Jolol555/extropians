<p>No kidding.  The reason the subsidiary I work for was acquired was that

West's current engineering group is, to be blunt, incompetent to the

extreme (when measured as a whole), mainly because of their beauracracy.

(And yes, that is my professional evaluation, after having worked with

them for a while.)  -_-;

<p>I'll take a look.  Any key words (besides those you mentioned in the

above) you think would be particularly relevant in searching for them?
