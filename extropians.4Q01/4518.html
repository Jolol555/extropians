<p>The freedom of the average individual was restricted by the
<br>
Taliban.  Though I'm aghast at situations where U.S. bombs
<br>
went astray (we really need to work on this) I'm surprised
<br>
at the relative precision of the operation.  I believe the
<br>
total non-combatant body-count in Afghanistan is significantly
<br>
below the ~3,000 people lost in the WTC attacks.
<br>
<p>I personally have traveled and worked in numerous foreign
<br>
countries over the last several decades.  I *can* compare
<br>
personal experiences with &quot;law enforcement&quot; representatives
<br>
in Seattle vs. Moscow.  There *really* is less freedom in
<br>
countries outside of the U.S.
<br>
<p>By arguing that the U.S. should not drop bombs, you *are*
<br>
arguing that it is proper and just that 28 million people
<br>
should have their freedom restricted by a handful of
<br>
religious zealots.  You are also arguing that people
<br>
be brainwashed into believing that 50% of the population
<br>
should be constrained to roles that are inherently inferior.
<br>
<p>Go ahead -- make your case.
