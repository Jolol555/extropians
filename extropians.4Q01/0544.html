Joe,
<br>
<p>While I normally grant almost all posters to the extropian list
<br>
a huge grain of salt, I must state that IMO the article by David
<br>
Selbourne was entirely useless.
<br>
<p>It was nothing more than a rundown of a position based on opinions
<br>
unsubstantiated by facts.
<br>
<p>Islam, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddism, etc. are faiths based
<br>
on the &quot;blind&quot; belief of one reality over another.  Since they
<br>
are cannot be subjected to scientific debate, they are useless
<br>
from an extropian perspective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Extropian Principles Section 7:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Extropians affirm reason, critical inquiry, intellectual independence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and honesty. We reject blind faith and the passive, comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that leads to dogma, conformity, and stagnation.
</em><br>
<p>While you might make a small case that it was useful based on
<br>
the expression of an opposing position, we know the world is
<br>
dominated by &quot;opposing&quot; positions and so one more cob in a
<br>
field of corn does not significantly advance the discussion.
<br>
<p>If you can point out a *useful* extropic point in the Selbourne
<br>
article, I'm willing to look at it.
<br>
<p>But if NOT -- NOTICE IS SERVED -- I'm in the Anders camp --
<br>
CONSUMING THE BANDWIDTH OF THE EXTROPIAN LIST, particularly with
<br>
reposts of people presumably unaware of our principles, IS UNEXTROPIC --
<br>
EXPECT ME TO CALL YOU A DIMWITTED NIMKOMPOOP IN PUBLIC FOR DOING SO.
<br>
ENGAGE YOUR BRAIN BEFORE YOU ENGAGE YOUR FINGERS.
<br>
(And feel free to plonk me if I'm so stupid as to do so.)
<br>
<p>If you want to form ExI-Related-News or ExI-Unextropic-News
<br>
*then* recruit the support of the board, get those lists started
<br>
and issue yourself a permit for policing those topics that
<br>
belong in one forum or another.  *We* control the dials on
<br>
our television sets -- *we* must learn to use them (taking
<br>
a page from the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; operating proceedures handbook...).
<br>
<p>Robert
