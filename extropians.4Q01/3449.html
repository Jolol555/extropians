<p>Suppose we had agreed, one of the many conditions the Japanese insisted on was
<br>
no occupation of the mainland so the military would still run things. A perfect set up for
<br>
another US Japanese war about 1950. Suppose we hadn't agreed but didn't use the bomb.
<br>
The Soviets declared war of Japan soon after these feelers so if the war didn't end
<br>
mighty damn quick you'd now have a poor communist totalitarian North Japan and
<br>
a rich capitalistic South Japan just as you have in Korea. Neither is a happy prospect.
<br>
As I said before however I do with they'd waited a few days before they bombed Nagasaki

<p><em>    &gt;You are narrowing the options down to bomb or invade.

</em><br>
<p>The US got a conditional surrender, not in name but in deed, it allowed Japan to
<br>
keep the Emperor. The US had peace feelers of its own, they responded with
<br>
a word in Japanese that can be interpreted as &quot;decline to answer at this time&quot;
<br>
or as &quot;too contemptible to answer&quot; or as simply &quot;silence&quot;. To this day even the
<br>
Japanese argue about what they meant. It seems to me that with thousands
<br>
dying every day it was their responsibility to eliminate baffle gab.
