<p>Great post Robert!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- it is the adoption of non-rational coercive
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Meme changing weapons would not necessarily be dangerous.
<br>
Consider the meme &quot;lay down your arms.&quot;  In our current
<br>
world, this meme does not bring peace.  The one who carries
<br>
it gets killed.  If history is clear on anything it is this: weakness
<br>
does not stop war, it invites war.  But imagine some sufficiently
<br>
advanced weapon that blankets the entire earth with the
<br>
swords-to-plowshares meme, one that works on everyone.
<br>
This is not a dangerous weapon but a weapon of peace.
<br>
<p>Granted I have not a clue what this mechanism would be like,
<br>
but this is my techno-pacifist vision for the future of transhumankind.
<br>
A meme-weapon would not necessarily destroy islam, but would
<br>
destroy *militant* islam and militant everything.
<br>
<p>In the mean time, let islam make war on my memeset by exhorting
<br>
me, by shaming my crass anarcho-capitalist ways, by showing me
<br>
what good and charitable people they are, by feeding their starving
<br>
masses, by allowing freedom to their women and their own unbelivers,
<br>
by how faithful they are in bowing toward mecca thrice daily, by the
<br>
sincerity of their prayers to allah.  Thats the kind of meme-war I
<br>
want to fight.  spike
