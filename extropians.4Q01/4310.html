<p><em>&gt; &gt; You're the one looking at the other guy. The other guy is looking at
</em><br>
you.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Can't be that hard, can it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree.  Just because the world can't detect the difference doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there isn't one.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I beg to differ: what cannot be measured /doesn't exist/.  If it is, in
<br>
principle, impossible for anyone to determine which of two lumps
<br>
of matter is made from the same atoms as some earlier lump of matter and
<br>
which wasn't, then the difference cannot matter to anyone, and
<br>
anyone who cares which is which is being irrational.&quot;
<br>
<p>The difference can not matter to anyone *externally* but if one of those
<br>
lumps of atoms were sentient, I think it would matter to that lump of atoms.
<br>
If I had an atom of hydrogen in each hand, mixed them up and the asked you
<br>
to tell which one was in which hand, you couldn't, but that does not negate
<br>
the fact that at one point in time one of them was indeed in my left hand.
<br>
Similarly, if the continual process of experience and sentience is reliant
<br>
on both the pattern of atoms and the atoms themselves, then the one group
<br>
that maintains the same atoms is the one that experiences subjective
<br>
continuity of consciousness.
<br>
<p>If you think it is being irrational, then point out the logical fallacy of
<br>
this argument.
<br>
<p>Assertion: Sentience is reliant on both the pattern of atoms and the atoms
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>1 - Sentience and perceptual continuity is reliant on the pattern of atoms.
<br>
<p>If someone took that atoms that made up your mind, and mushed them up, it
<br>
would not pass the Turing test let alone pass as a reasonable representation
<br>
of you in conversation.  Therefore the pattern of atoms is important.
<br>
<p>2 - Sentience and perceptual continuity is reliant on the atoms themselves
<br>
that make up the patter.
<br>
<p>- non-Destructive copying example -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a passive scanner determines the precise location of every
<br>
atom in my body, its type, and what neighboring atoms it is bonded to, and
<br>
proceeds to construct a atomic level duplicate of me.  We are both awakened
<br>
and escorted to separate rooms, the 'copy' is asked if he is able to see
<br>
what the 'original' (me) sees, the 'copy' reports that he can not.
<br>
Therefore the copy is not me, as he does not experience, subjectively, what
<br>
I experience.
<br>
<p>- non-destructive scanning with delayed destruction -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a passive scanner determines the precise location of every
<br>
atom in my body, its type, and what neighboring atoms it is bonded to, and
<br>
proceeds to construct a atomic level duplicate of me.  We are both awakened
<br>
and escorted to separate rooms, the 'copy' is asked if he is able to see
<br>
what the 'original' (me) sees, the 'copy' reports that he can not.
<br>
Therefore the copy is not me, as he does not experience, subjectively, what
<br>
I experience.  The 'original' (me) is then killed.  
<br>
<p>Is the 'copy' me? 
<br>
<p>- Destructive copying example -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a destructive scanning machine determines the precise
<br>
location of every atom in my body while disrupting the information of the
<br>
previous atom it scanned.  Using the collected information, an atomic level
<br>
duplicate is made of me.  This duplicate is then asked if he is the
<br>
original, as far as he can tell, he is.  Did he experience subjectivity
<br>
continuity of consciousness?  Given the information provided in the previous
<br>
two scenarios, it is reasonable and logical to assume he did not.  'I'  the
<br>
original 'me' therefore did not experience continuity of consciousness.
<br>
Therefore sentience and continuity of consciousness relies on the material
<br>
making up the pattern as well, otherwise it is a copy experiencing its own
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>Since this logical excursion demonstrates that...
<br>
<p>1) Sentience and continuity of perception is reliant upon the pattern of
<br>
atoms
<br>
<p>2) Sentience and continuity of perception is reliant upon the atoms that
<br>
make up the pattern
<br>
<p>Then is it reasonable, logical, and scientific to assume that a 'copy' is
<br>
subjectively not me, but in fact a unique individual of its own.  
<br>
<p>To me, this argument is pretty sound, if someone feels otherwise, please
<br>
point out the fallacy in this line of reasoning.  If we are primarily
<br>
concerned about subjective immortality, then we should be concerned with
<br>
making a reasonable and logical assumption based on the scientific method as
<br>
to the best way to achieve this goal.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael
