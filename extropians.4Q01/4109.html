More handwaving math:
<br>
<p>The Statistical Abstract lists &quot;non-utility&quot; solar installation as 385
<br>
megawatts installed capacity.  Since this is &quot;non-utility&quot;, I'll assume
<br>
that it's a wide variety of locations and types, many possibly
<br>
non-optimal.  This capacity generated 887 million kilowatt/hours, or about
<br>
2300 kw/hrs per year per kilowatt installed capacity.  At 30,000 kw/hr per
<br>
year per person, this works out to about 13 kw installed capacity, which
<br>
according to the worksheet at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.jademountain.com/energyProducts/pv.html">http://www.jademountain.com/energyProducts/pv.html</a>
<br>
<p>is almost exactly 100 square meters of panel (to be exact, 270 PV165
<br>
modules at a cost of $79,650). 
<br>
<p>This would mean 1 square kilometer would support 10,000 people for all
<br>
energy usage, or 300 million people in the US would require 30,000 square
<br>
kilometers of panel.  This is about 0.3% of the coverage of the United
<br>
States, or 10% of the State of Arizona, or less than 5% of Texas.  Or less
<br>
than 8% of the total developed land (~380,000 km^2) in the US.  Or about
<br>
2.25% of US cropland. 
<br>
<p>Or, with a nod to Eric Drexler, about the same as the 6.25 million
<br>
kilometers of road in the US, assuming an average width of 5 meters. 
<br>
<p>I don't think land or the aesthetics of land use will be a significant
<br>
barrier to the adoption of solar power.  Price, and its intermittant
<br>
nature, are much more serious problems.  If price dropped about an order
<br>
of magnitude, though, I think it could become very attractive for a lot of
<br>
uses (including residential). Personally, I think that solar and nuclear
<br>
power complement each other well.
