From: &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Where%20we%20lost%20America&In-Reply-To=&lt;02fb01c166d1$8f043460$0a5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">neptune@mars.superlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Not completely true.  The Soviets, e.g., did murder a lot of people because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their religion, especially the Patriarch and clergy in the Russian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Orthodox Church.  They also made the life of believers much harder all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around.  This goes on to this day.  Witness China's policy to Tibetan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhists and to that cult whose name escapes me.
</em><br>
<p>It's difficult to find anything that is completely true. If atheists murdered
<br>
clergy, one wonders how many clergy were also murdered by opposing clergy. In
<br>
the religious wars, I tend to think of atheists as the referees and
<br>
scorekeepers, because they have less at stake, and less invested in the
<br>
morality play, so they can better maintain their objectivity. I've read that
<br>
China has been non-theistic for thousands of years, placing trust in the
<br>
teachings of Confucius rather than supernaturalism. So it's a cultural
<br>
imperative for Chinese policy to oppose theism, not exactly an atheistic
<br>
pogrom. Also, don't forget that the Tibetan Buddhists, like all who believe in
<br>
Buddhism, do not believe in God. As Bertrand Russell used to say, &quot;Buddism is
<br>
the most godly of godless religions.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In these cases, the ideology is the reason for the pogrom against religion.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's how I see it too. Ideologues have a tendency to worship the state
<br>
(or the entity that represents their ideology) above all else, and they can't
<br>
stand to see anyone place anything above that. So, I rather appreciate what
<br>
religious nuts have done in the US when they oppose the US government (Waco,
<br>
Ruby Ridge, etc.). That sure takes some of the pressure off libertarians and
<br>
bikers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; None of this is to say atheists are the moral equivalent of theists, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheism in itself does not guarantee one will not murder people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differing beliefs, especially theists.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense. Atheists may also be a bit more susceptible to the
<br>
latest ideological fad, because they haven't already filled up their brains
<br>
with faith memes and systems of belief. As for moral equivalence, I still find
<br>
E. O. Wilson's idea most compelling: We moralize based on what our biological
<br>
predisposition prompts us to. As Dawkins might (not) say, our selfish genes
<br>
don't care what belief system we choose, as long as it allows us to
<br>
overpopulate the world with it. When it comes down to why people believe
<br>
whatever they do, I think almost everyone inherits their beliefs from their
<br>
parents -- not genetically, of course, but via psychological imprinting.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
