<p>Oh, agreed.  They provide the illusion of working - which, itself, is
<br>
enough to stimulate the economy and do a bunch of other good things -
<br>
but as to what they were originally intended to do, they fall down.
<br>
Still, most large corporations buy into the illusion enough that their
<br>
actions are based on a belief that the laws work; if they think the law
<br>
will protect them against all assaults, why invest in further defenses?
