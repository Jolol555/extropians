We received this in the E-mail today from an employee of one of my
<br>
larger customers (Raytheon Missile Systems). Very interesting letter
<br>
that I think some of you will like and understand. If there are any
<br>
glaring problems with what he says, let me know.
<br>
<p>Best to everyone

_____________
<br>
<p>Dear Classmates:
<br>
<p>Many of you are probably not aware that I was one of the last American
<br>
citizens to have spent a great deal of time in Afghanistan. I was first
<br>
there in 1993 providing relief and assistance to refugees along the
<br>
Tajik
<br>
border and in this capacity have traveled all along the border region
<br>
between
<br>
the two countries. In 1998 and 1999 I was the Deputy Program Manager for
<br>
<p>the UN's mine action program in Afghanistan. This program is the largest
<br>
<p>civilian employer in the country with over 5,000 persons clearing mines
<br>
and
<br>
UXO. In this later capacity, I was somewhat ironically engaged in a
<br>
&quot;Holy
<br>
War&quot; as decreed by the Taliban, against the evil of landmines, and by a
<br>
special proclamation of Mullah Omar, all those who might have died in
<br>
this
<br>
<p>effort were considered to &quot;martyrs&quot; even an &quot;infidel&quot; like myself. The
<br>
mine
<br>
action program is the most respected relief effort in the country and
<br>
<p>because of this I had the opportunity to travel extensively, without too
<br>
<p>much
<br>
interference or restriction. I still have extensive contacts in the area
<br>
and
<br>
among the Afghan community and read a great deal on the subject.
<br>
<p>I had wanted to write earlier and share some of my perspectives, but
<br>
quite
<br>
<p>frankly I have been a bit too popular in DC this past week and have not
<br>
had
<br>
time. Dr. Tony Kern's comments were excellent and I would like to use
<br>
them
<br>
as a basis for sharing some observations.
<br>
<p>First, he is absolutely correct. This war is about will, resolve and
<br>
character. I want to touch on that later, but first I want to share some
<br>
<p>comments about our &quot;enemy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Our enemy is not the people of Afghanistan. The country is devastated
<br>
beyond
<br>
what most of us can imagine. The vast majority of the people live
<br>
day-to-day, hand to mouth in abject conditions of poverty, misery and
<br>
deprivation. Less than 30% of the men are literate, the women even less.
<br>
The
<br>
country is exhausted, and desperately wants something like peace. They
<br>
know very little of the world at large, and have no access to
<br>
information or
<br>
knowledge that would counter what they are being told by the Taliban.
<br>
They
<br>
have nothing left, nothing that is except for their pride.
<br>
<p>Who is our enemy? Well, our enemy is a group of non-Afghans, often
<br>
referred
<br>
to by the Afghans as &quot;Arabs&quot; and a fanatical group of religious leaders
<br>
and
<br>
their military cohort, the Taliban. The non-Afghan contingent came from
<br>
all
<br>
over the Islamic world to fight in the war against the Russians. Many
<br>
came using a covert network created with assistance by our own
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>OBL (as Osama bin Laden was referred to by us in the country at the
<br>
time)
<br>
restored this network to bring in more fighters, this time to support
<br>
the
<br>
Taliban in their civil war against the former Mujehdeen. Over time this
<br>
military support along with financial support has allowed OBL and his
<br>
&quot;Arabs&quot;
<br>
to co-opt significant government activities and leaders. OBL is the
<br>
&quot;inspector general&quot; of Taliban armed forces, his bodyguards protect
<br>
senior
<br>
<p>Talib leaders and he has built a system of deep bunkers for the Taliban,
<br>
<p>which were designed to withstand cruise missile strikes (uhm, where did
<br>
he
<br>
learn to do that?). His forces basically rule the southern city of
<br>
Kandahar.
<br>
<p>This high-profile presence of OBL and his &quot;Arabs&quot; has, in the last 2
<br>
years
<br>
<p>or
<br>
so, started to generate a great deal of resentment on the part of the
<br>
local
<br>
Afghans. At the same time the legitimacy of the Taliban regime has
<br>
started
<br>
to decrease as it has failed to end the war, as local humanitarian
<br>
conditions
<br>
have worsened and as &quot;cultural&quot; restrictions have become even harsher.
<br>
It
<br>
is my assessment that most Afghans no longer support the Taliban. Indeed
<br>
the
<br>
Taliban have recently had a very difficult time getting recruits for
<br>
their
<br>
forces and have had to rely more and more on non-Afghans, either from
<br>
Pushtun tribes in Pakistan or from OBL. OBL and the Taliban, absent any
<br>
US
<br>
action were probably on their way to sharing the same fate that all
<br>
other
<br>
outsiders and outside doctrines have experienced in Afghanistan-defeat
<br>
and
<br>
<p>dismemberment.
<br>
<p>During the Afghan war with the Soviets much attention was paid to the
<br>
martial
<br>
prowess of the Afghans. We were all at West Point at the time and most
<br>
of
<br>
us had high-minded idealistic thoughts about how we would all want to go
<br>
<p>help
<br>
the brave &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in their struggle against the Soviets.
<br>
Those
<br>
concepts were naive to the extreme. The Afghans, while never conquered
<br>
as a
<br>
nation, are not invincible in battle. A &quot;good&quot; Afghan battle is one that
<br>
<p>makes a lot of noise and light. Basic military skills are rudimentary
<br>
and
<br>
clouded by cultural constraints that no matter what, a warrior should
<br>
never
<br>
lose his honor. Indeed, firing from the prone is considered distasteful
<br>
(but
<br>
still done). Traditionally, the Afghan order of battle is very feudal
<br>
in nature, with fighters owing allegiance to a &quot;commander&quot; and this
<br>
person
<br>
<p>owing allegiance upwards and so on and so on. Often such allegiance is
<br>
secured by payment. And while the Taliban forces have changed this
<br>
somewhat,
<br>
many of the units in the Taliban army are there because they are
<br>
<p>being paid to be there. All such groups have very strong loyalties along
<br>
<p>ethnic and tribal lines. Again, the concept of having a place of &quot;honor&quot;
<br>
and
<br>
&quot;respect&quot; is of paramount importance and blood feuds between families
<br>
and
<br>
tribes can last for generations over a perceived or actual slight. That
<br>
is
<br>
one reason why there were 7 groups of Mujehdeen fighting the Russians.
<br>
It
<br>
is a very difficult task to form and keep united a large bunch of
<br>
Afghans
<br>
into a military formation. The &quot;real&quot; stories that have come out of the
<br>
war
<br>
against the Soviets are very enlightening and a lot different from our
<br>
fantastic visions as cadets. When the first batch of Stingers came in
<br>
and
<br>
were given to one Mujehdeen group, another group-supposedly on the same
<br>
side,
<br>
attached the first group and stole the Stingers, not so much because
<br>
they
<br>
wanted to use them, but because having them was a matter of prestige.
<br>
Many
<br>
larger coordinated attacks that advisers tried to conduct failed when
<br>
all
<br>
the
<br>
various Afghan fighting groups would give up their assigned tasks (such
<br>
as
<br>
<p>blocking or overwatch) and instead would join the assault group in order
<br>
to
<br>
seek glory. In comparison to Vietnam, the intensity of combat and the
<br>
rate
<br>
of fatalities were lower for all involved.
<br>
<p>As you can tell from above, it is my assessment that these guys are not
<br>
THAT
<br>
good in a purely military sense and the &quot;Arabs&quot; probably even less so
<br>
than
<br>
<p>the Afghans. So why is it that they have never been conquered? It goes
<br>
back
<br>
to Dr. Kern's point about will. During their history the only events
<br>
that have managed to form any semblance of unity among the Afghans, is
<br>
the
<br>
<p>desire to fight foreign invaders. And in doing this the Afghans have
<br>
been
<br>
fanatical. The Afghans' greatest military strength is the ability to
<br>
endure
<br>
hardships that would, in all probability, kill most Americans and
<br>
enervate
<br>
<p>the resolve of all but the most elite military units. The physical
<br>
difficulties of fighting in Afghanistan, the terrain, the weather and
<br>
the
<br>
harshness are all weapons that our enemies will use to their advantage
<br>
and
<br>
<p>use well. (NOTE: For you military planner types and armchair
<br>
generals--around November 1st most road movement is impossible, in part
<br>
because all the roads used by the Russians have been destroyed and air
<br>
movement will be problematic at best).
<br>
<p>Also, those fighting us are not afraid to fight. OBL and others do not
<br>
think
<br>
the US has the will or the stomach for a fight. Indeed after the
<br>
absolutely
<br>
inane missile strikes of 1998, the overwhelming consensus was that we
<br>
were
<br>
<p>cowards, who would not risk one life in face to face combat. Rather than
<br>
<p>demonstrating our might and acting as a deterrent, that action and
<br>
others of
<br>
the not so recent past, have reinforced the perception that the US does
<br>
not
<br>
have any &quot;will&quot; and that were are morally and spiritually corrupt.
<br>
<p>Our challenge is to play to the weaknesses of our enemy, notably their
<br>
propensity for internal struggles, the distrust between the
<br>
extremists/Arabs
<br>
and the majority of Afghans, their limited ability to fight coordinated
<br>
battles and their lack of external support. More importantly through is
<br>
that
<br>
we have to take steps not to play to their strengths, which would be to
<br>
unite the entire population against us by increasing their suffering or
<br>
killing innocents, to get bogged down trying to hold terrain, or to get
<br>
into
<br>
a battle of attrition chasing up and down mountain valleys.
<br>
<p>I have been asked how I would fight the war. This is a big question and
<br>
well
<br>
beyond my pay grade or expertise. And while I do not want to second
<br>
guess
<br>
current plans or start an academic debate I would share the following
<br>
from what I know about Afghanistan and the Afghans. First, I would give
<br>
the
<br>
Northern Alliance a big wad of cash so that they can buy off a chunk of
<br>
the
<br>
Taliban army before winter. Second, also with this cash I would pay some
<br>
<p>guys to kill some of the Taliban leadership making it look like an
<br>
inside
<br>
job
<br>
to spread distrust and build on existing discord. Third I would support
<br>
the
<br>
Northern alliance with military assets, but not take it over or adopt so
<br>
<p>high
<br>
a profile as to undermine its legitimacy in the eyes of most Afghans.
<br>
Fourth
<br>
would be to give massive amounts of humanitarian aid and assistance
<br>
<p>to
<br>
the Afghans in Pakistan in order to demonstrate our goodwill and to give
<br>
<p>these guys a reason to live rather than the choice between dying of
<br>
starvation or dying fighting the &quot;infidel.&quot; Fifth, start a series of
<br>
public
<br>
works projects in areas of the country not under Taliban control (these
<br>
are
<br>
much more than the press reports) again to demonstrate goodwill and that
<br>
<p>improvements come with peace. Sixth, I would consider vary carefully
<br>
putting
<br>
any female service members into Afghanistan proper-sorry to the females
<br>
of
<br>
<p>our class but within that culture a man who allows a women to fight for
<br>
him
<br>
has zero respect, and we will need respect to gain the cooperation of
<br>
Afghan
<br>
allies. No Afghan will work with a man who fights with women. I would
<br>
hold
<br>
off from doing anything to dramatic in the new term, keeping a low level
<br>
of
<br>
covert action and pressure up over the winter, allowing this pressure to
<br>
<p>force open the fissions around the Taliban that were already developing.
<br>
I
<br>
expect that they will quickly turn on themselves and on OBL. We can pick
<br>
up
<br>
the pieces next summer, or the summer after. When we do &quot;pick-up&quot; the
<br>
pieces
<br>
I would make sure that we do so on the ground, &quot;man to man.&quot; While
<br>
I would never want to advocate American causalities, it is essential
<br>
that we
<br>
communicate to OBL and all others watching that we can and will &quot;engage
<br>
and
<br>
destroy the enemy in close combat.&quot; As mentioned above, we should not
<br>
try
<br>
to gain or hold terrain, but Infantry operations against the enemy are
<br>
essential. There can be no excuses after the defeat or lingering doubts
<br>
in
<br>
the minds of our enemies regarding American resolve and nothing, nothing
<br>
<p>will communicate this except for ground combat. And once this is all
<br>
over,
<br>
unlike in 1989 the US must provide continued long-term economic
<br>
assistance
<br>
to rebuild the country.
<br>
<p>While I have written too much already, I think it is also important to
<br>
share
<br>
a few things on the subject of brutality. Our opponents will not abide
<br>
by
<br>
the Geneva conventions. There will be no prisoners unless there is a
<br>
chance
<br>
that they can be ransomed or made part of a local prisoner exchange.
<br>
During
<br>
the war with the Soviets, videotapes were made of communist prisoners
<br>
having
<br>
their throats slit. Indeed, there did exist a &quot;trade&quot; in prisoners so
<br>
that
<br>
souvenir videos could be made by outsiders to take home with them. This
<br>
practice has spread to the Philippines, Bosnia and Chechnya were similar
<br>
<p>videos are being made today and can be found on the web for those so
<br>
inclined. We can expect our soldiers to be treated the same way.
<br>
Sometime
<br>
during this war I expect that we will see videos of US prisoners having
<br>
their heads cut off. Our enemies will do this not only to demonstrate
<br>
their
<br>
&quot;strength&quot; to their followers, but also to cause us to overreact, to
<br>
seek
<br>
wholesale revenge against civilian populations and to turn
<br>
this into the world wide religious war that they desperately want. This
<br>
will
<br>
be a test of our will and of our character. (For further collaboration
<br>
of this type of activity please read Kipling).
<br>
<p>This will not be a pretty war; it will be a war of wills, of resolve and
<br>
<p>somewhat conversely of compassion and of a character. Towards our
<br>
enemies,
<br>
we must show a level of ruthlessness that has not been part of our
<br>
military
<br>
character for a long time. But to those who are not our enemies we must
<br>
show
<br>
a level of compassion probably unheard of during war. We should do this
<br>
not
<br>
for humanitarian reasons, even though there are many, but for shrewd
<br>
military
<br>
logic.
<br>
<p>For anyone who is still reading this way to long note, thanks for your
<br>
patience. I will try to answer any questions that may arise in a more
<br>
concise manner.
<br>
<p>Thanks, Richard Kidd
