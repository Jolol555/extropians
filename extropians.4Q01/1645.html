<em>&gt; &gt;As Larry Niven once said, &quot;Ethics change with technology.&quot;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;agree that there is an ethical rule stating &quot;pay for what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;copy&quot;, but this is a very different rule than &quot;pay for what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;take&quot;, and those who equate freeloading with theft will continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to find that the Napster generation are deaf to an argument that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rests on a flawed analogy.  You can tell the Napster generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that nice people tip; you can't tell them that what they do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;theft, because it's not.  And besides, didn't I just finish asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people to untangle their wishes and their predictions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What they do is legally defined as theft, whether &quot;they&quot; choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize it or not.
</em><br>
<p>The law is powerless.  Artists are powerless.  The opinions of the Napster
<br>
generation are the only opinions that matter, because they determine how
<br>
much the artist gets paid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Uhh... this is blatantly untrue.  Freeloading may increase total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unfairness, but it still increases wealth.  Downloading always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;increases wealth.  If the artists paid *me* to download their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;works, each download would still increase wealth.  Suppose that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have $1000, the artist has $1000, I have 0GB, and the artist has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1GB.  The following payoff matrix shows that each download
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;increases real wealth:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It most certainly does not increase wealth. If I am an artist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the material I write to be payed for is stolen, I have gained no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth.
</em><br>
<p>I am speaking about total wealth in the system, not the wealth of any
<br>
single party.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your argument translates to &quot;stealing increases wealth&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Copying increases wealth.  If someone steals my television set, I lost a
<br>
television set and they gained a television set, so the net effect is zero
<br>
except for unfairness costs.  If someone copies my television set, I lose
<br>
nothing, and the copier gains a television set.  If the copier doesn't tip
<br>
the TV set designer a couple of bucks, I lose because I'm less likely to
<br>
be able to buy (copy) (download) better TV sets in the future.  But the TV
<br>
set designer has not actually lost money; they simply have not received a
<br>
gain to which you would argue they are legally entitled.  Real wealth has
<br>
increased, but so has unfairness.
<br>
<p>To put it another way, suppose that someone copies a TV set.  I'm sure
<br>
that you would argue that the law says that the copier has just stolen
<br>
$400 from the TV designer.  Leaving aside the total unenforceability of
<br>
the law, wealth has *still* been created.  Let's say you're the TV
<br>
designer.  If I freeload a TV, it's as if a magic fairy were to give you
<br>
$400 of new wealth, after which I steal $400 from you.  At the end of the
<br>
day you are no richer, and I have my stolen goods at no benefit to you,
<br>
but $400 of new wealth has still entered the system from *somewhere*.  You
<br>
can, if you want, phrase the situation so that the real wealth was created
<br>
at the artist's node and then stolen by the evil freeloader, but the point
<br>
is that each additional download of a TV set *still* creates an additional
<br>
$400 of new wealth.
<br>
<p>And you are, of course, wrong *in practice* to call it &quot;theft&quot;, because in
<br>
practice, the only way for artists to be paid is for downloaders to decide
<br>
to pay them.  You do not use the word &quot;theft&quot; to a downloader; that word
<br>
does not correspond to their intuitive perception of the situation.  You
<br>
use the word &quot;freeloader&quot;, so that they see the justice of your argument
<br>
and agree to tip.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Now of course you can argue that unfairness is a real economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cost that decreases efficiency.  With this I agree, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whether it's enough to overcome the vast wealth created by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;downloading is a separate issue.  You can argue that money paid to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the artist generates future wealth and I agree with this as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But in the short term, each incremental download always generates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wealth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stealing valuable material still does not translate to an increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in wealth.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, it doesn't.  Copying valuable material translates to an increase
<br>
in wealth.  Arguably this is offset by unfairness costs.  Arguably it is
<br>
not.
