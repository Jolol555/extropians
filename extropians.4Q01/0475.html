<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sufism is definitely linked with Islam.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It is the offspring... and the parent has died.
</em><br>
<p>Sufism would be an &quot;offspring&quot; of Islam, only in the Sufi's definition
<br>
of Islam (what you write below). Then it fits:  it follows with their
<br>
ideas of &quot;transmutation&quot;, that is, Sufism as a 'nutrient' for society,
<br>
and to then transmute and disappear, leaving alterred traces only.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;To the Sufi, Islam means surrender and love. An organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transformation and combination of two qualities, which creates a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;third. The sage is the burgeoning of two kinds of energy. In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definition of the Sufi, he is balanced, without any duality, and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wholeness is unified; there is a silent tranquility about him. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is no longer any conflict or antagonism going on in him. He is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;torn between sin and saintliness. There is a sublime peace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and equilibrium, a cosmic silence. That's what Sufis call _islam_.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I know, because a wise old Turk once told me so.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--Alligator Grundy
</em><br>
<p>Nice. Compare with, to the Muslim, &quot;Islam&quot; (an Arabic word meaning
<br>
submission and surrender) is complete submission to Allah. By the way,
<br>
the Sufis have a different interpretation than the Muslims of the
<br>
concept &quot;Allah&quot;, as well.
<br>
<p>A traditional Sufi story:
<br>
<p>Four men: a Persian, a Turk, an Arab, ad a Greek were standing in a
<br>
village street. They were traveling companions, making for some
<br>
distant place; but at this moment they were arguing over the spending
<br>
of a single piece of money which was all that they had among them.
<br>
<p>&quot;I want to buy angur,&quot; said the Persian.
<br>
&quot;I want uzum,&quot; said the Turk.
<br>
&quot;I want inab,&quot; said the Arab.
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; said the Greek, &quot;we should buy stafil.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another traveler passing, a linguist, said, &quot;Give the coin to me. I
<br>
undertake to satisfy the desires of all of you.&quot;
<br>
<p>At first they would not trust him. Ultimately they let him have the
<br>
coin. He went to the shop of a fruit seller and brought four small
<br>
bunches of grapes.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is my angur,&quot; said the Persian.
<br>
&quot;But this is what I call uzum,&quot; said the Turk.
<br>
&quot;You have brought me inab,&quot; said the Arab.
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; said the Greek, &quot;this in my language is stafil.&quot;
<br>
<p>The grapes were shared out among them, and each realized that they
<br>
wanted the same thing, and the disharmony had been due to his faulty
<br>
understanding of the language of the others.
<br>
<p>A Sufi teacher would say that the travelers are the regular people of
<br>
the world. The linguist is the Sufi, showing them that they want the
<br>
same thing. The Sufi, as a people's &quot;servant&quot;, can give a primary
<br>
lesson of the fundamental identity, but the true essence and inner
<br>
doctrine of Sufism that he/can provide is the wine produced by the
<br>
grapes.
