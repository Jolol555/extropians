<p>Speaking of memesets, there was a rather fortunate
<br>
meme inserted among OBL's memeset that was repeated
<br>
often by him and the other clerics.  They kept saying
<br>
&quot;...if allah is with us, then the jihad will succeed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, clearly, it didn't.  The jihad was an ignominious
<br>
failure, the al-qaida is cowering in caves after failing
<br>
to slay even a single US soldier in battle, while losing
<br>
appalling numbers of their own.  Where was allah?  Even
<br>
the densest Islamic militant must now conclude that allah
<br>
wasn't with them on this, and that furthermore, next time
<br>
allah calls them to jihad, it might turn out just as bad, likely
<br>
faaaar worse, for the infidels will be more prepared.
<br>
<p>Many of us have concluded that this war will not end
<br>
terrorism, but let's wait and watch and try a little of that
<br>
practical optimism.  This tragedy just *might* discourage
<br>
terrorism.  spike
