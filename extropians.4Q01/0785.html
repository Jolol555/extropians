&nbsp;|psi_huh&gt;, |psi_hoh&gt; and |psi_off_to_work_we_go&gt;

do I get a prize?
<br>
A2.
<br>
I survive on 25 year old engineering maths and 2nd year (3rd year?) QM
<br>
course, so bear with me on this while you folk update my education. I need a
<br>
little help.....
<br>
<em>	&gt; A single particle is prepared in a (weird) superposition.
</em><br>
We are going to transform the properties (wave function?) of a particle.
<br>
<em>	&gt; The superposition consists in being in three boxes.
</em><br>
Interpreted to mean: When the superposition transformation is complete the
<br>
probability of spatial position in one of 3 defined regions of space is
<br>
controlled to a defined extent.
<br>
<em>	&gt; The initial state is |psi_1&gt;
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; |psi_1&gt; = 3 ^ (-1/2) ( |A&gt; + |B&gt; + |C&gt; )
</em><br>
psi_1 is a vector. A, B, C are orthogonal vector representations of the
<br>
spatial distribution of the state, normalised (1 over root 3).
<br>
<em>	&gt; and the final state is |psi_2&gt;
</em><br>
when the quantum wierdness has been applied the new state is
<br>
<em>	&gt; |psi_2&gt; = 3 ^ (-1/2) ( |A&gt; + |B&gt; - |C&gt; )
</em><br>
.ie. a vector subtraction the component in the C reverses the C component
<br>
and leaves A and B alone.
<br>
<em>	&gt; where A, B and C are the three boxes.
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; If you search, in the intermediate time, in the box A
</em><br>
meaning you make a measurement in region A and collapse the wave function to
<br>
give an accurate position *prior to the transformation*
<br>
<em>	&gt; you'll find the particle.
</em><br>
will you? In multiple measurements you'll get the particle a proportion of
<br>
the time but not all ...at least that's what I thought the a wave function
<br>
of position meant. In a single measurement all you have is a proability of
<br>
'find'.
<br>
<em>	&gt; Otherwise the state would be
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; |psi_huh&gt; = 2 ^ (-1/2) ( |B&gt; + |C&gt; ) which is forbidden
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; being orthogonal to the final state.
</em><br>
Having done the measurement, isn't the process of carrying out the
<br>
transformation meaningless?
<br>
The measurement forces all 'position' into box A. We then do a
<br>
transformation involving C. How can the final state end up as the stated
<br>
|psi_2 without altering the transformation?
<br>
<em>	&gt; If you search, in intermediate time, in the box B
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; you'll find the particle. Otherwise the state would be
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; |psi_hoh&gt; = 2 ^ (-1/2) ( |A&gt; + |C&gt; ) which is forbidden
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; being orthogonal to the final state.
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; Then the single particle is in the box A (searching in A)
</em><br>
<em>	&gt; and in the box B (searching in B).
</em><br>
You have a probability of a 'find' increase by the contribution of A and B
<br>
totalled up?
<br>
<em>	&gt; What about searching in A *and* B? I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>I question the nature of the 'measurement'. The question assumes that the
<br>
measurement is of a type designed to resolve the quantity 'position' in
<br>
region A. If the measurement were redined/re-engineered to resolve position
<br>
in both regions A or B, then you'll get a combined result. If you make two
<br>
simultaneous A-type measurements then you'll 'find' it either in A or B but
<br>
not both in proportion to the A and B vector contributions. Yes?
<br>
<em>	&gt; And it's too late now. And QM is a nasty trick.
</em><br>
Damn right.
<br>
Maybe I'm just totally off the track. Maybe when you say 'being in 3 boxes'
<br>
you mean classified in one of 3 ways (eg spin, velocity, position). I
<br>
struggle with the jargon. Thanks for making me think.
<br>
<p>cheers
