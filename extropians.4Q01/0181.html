</em><br>
<p>Others have responded.  I'll take a crack at a couple of critical
<br>
points.
<br>
<p>Quotes from the main page
<br>
<em>&gt; new universal physical principle that contributes to the progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and well-being of future generations of mankind
</em><br>
<p>There isn't any &quot;universal physical principal&quot; devoted to the progress
<br>
and well-being of future generations of mankind.  There is a universal
<br>
physical principle that anything (molecule, bacteria, plant, animal, meme,
<br>
etc.) that manages to develop sufficient complexity to make copies
<br>
of itself will evolve and perhaps survive in some form in the long term.
<br>
There is an alternate physical principal that says that if you are clever
<br>
(complex?) enough to trump your &quot;local&quot; hazard function you can achieve
<br>
physical immortality for a significantly extended period.
<br>
<p>&quot;Mankind&quot; is only an instantiation of an animal in the middle of the
<br>
complexification process that produces better survival machinery.
<br>
Individuals must evolve past current instantiations of the human
<br>
physical body if they expect to achieve &quot;physical immortality&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; political progress that recognizes human equality
</em><br>
<p>I think we need a reality check here.  I think it would be political
<br>
progress if we recognized fundamentally that humans are not &quot;equal&quot;.
<br>
I'm moderately certain that both Eliezer and Anders are smarter than
<br>
I am -- I am *not* their equal.  Natasha is certainly more artistic than
<br>
I am -- I am *not* her equal.  Most of the people on the list can probably
<br>
sing better than I can -- I am not their equal.  The only thing potentially
<br>
&quot;equal&quot; regarding humans is that they should perhaps be granted some &quot;equal&quot;
<br>
rights.  Even this should be viewed with a raised eyebrow (I don't have
<br>
a &quot;right&quot; to pilot a plane for example).  If the capacities of sentient
<br>
beings expands as I expect it to, then there will be a substantially larger
<br>
range of the &quot;rights&quot; granted to beings at different levels of development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Classical humanism&quot; is an historically proven web of ideas that lays the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best foundation for progress.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Best foundation&quot;?  How do we know this for certain?  What fraction of the
<br>
other possible systems have been tried and measured for success or failure?
<br>
Do we even know how many other possible systems there might be?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ideas which constitute it can be found in a wide array of times and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures throughout human history, though more strongly and notably at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some points than others. 
</em><br>
<p>This sounds like &quot;classical humanism&quot; is nothing more than the common
<br>
moral code derived from biological and social principles that have
<br>
their roots in human tribalism and group survival strategies.  This
<br>
was discussed in previous postings pointing to E. O. Wilson's article
<br>
about consilience.
<br>
<p>I see nothing wrong with supporting &quot;classical humanism&quot; if it is the
<br>
best strategy for &quot;complexification&quot;.  However there doesn't seem to
<br>
be much evidence on which that claim can be made.  The complexification
<br>
of Russia was accomplished at a very high price but was carried out in
<br>
1/2 to 1/4 of the time Western civilizations took to accomplish the same
<br>
development.  It certainly didn't use a &quot;classical humanism&quot; approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 600 years if the problem of biological aging can be completely solved
</em><br>
<p>If aging can be completely solved, average longevity at current U.S.
<br>
hazard function rates would be &gt; 2000 years.  If those rates continue to
<br>
improve as they have over the last half century, then by 2100 average
<br>
longevity will be in excess of 6000 years.
