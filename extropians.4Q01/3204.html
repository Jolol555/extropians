John -- regarding your post:<br><br>
At 09:32 PM 11/24/01, you wrote:<br><br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>Oh for God's sake stop whining! You
and several other members of<br>
this list have written more verbiage on my use of the word
&quot;idiot&quot; than on<br>
all other topics combined, with the possible exception of long
essays<br>
that must have taken hours to write about how name calling wastes
time.<br>
Everybody was strangely quiet however when a good 10 days before<br>
my famous use of that word you called me an &quot;immoral
curr&quot;.</blockquote><br>
I have been disappointed to return to dipping into the List to see a
string of very unpleasant exchanges. I understand that you have strong
feelings and that you did not originate the name-calling. I also have
enjoyed your posts over the years.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I am asking you to refrain from posting messages such as
this. This painfully phrased response to responses to responses about an
argument is not what we want to see on the list. Samantha and others who
do this will also receive first a private email, then a public warning,
and if necessary finally a temporary removal from the list.<br><br>
Please refrain from public posts like this. I know it's difficult, but
just let it go or take it private. Let's see the old John Clark
return.<br><br>
