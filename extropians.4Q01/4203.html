<em>&gt; I don't think there's anyone here who will rationally argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the contention that if I underwent a non-destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom-by-atom copy process, two 100-kg lumps of matter would wake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with the memeories I presently call &quot;mine&quot;, as well as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensations, perceptions, values, desires, and intentions I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mine.  It doesn't matter to me which one I call &quot;me&quot;, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters is what actual consequences will this action have on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world, are they likely to happen in the future, and which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them are good and bad?
</em><br>
<p>Given that it doesn't matter to you which one of a set of similar Lees is
<br>
you, why do you care of any of them is? Do you in fact care if any of them
<br>
is &quot;you&quot;? With respect to what do you judge the consequences of the action
<br>
that you describe above? Why?
