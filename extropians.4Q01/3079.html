</em><br>
<em>&gt; scape-goat. 
</em><br>
<p>Here's where we part company.
<br>
<p>Firstly, these countries mostly didn't exist before the 1920's. There
<br>
isn't a strong tradition of nation-building in the islamic world; they're
<br>
all supposed to be one big happy family, which is why you tend to see
<br>
strong clan/extended family ties and then a curious lack of structure
<br>
all the way up to Empire size. The last big islamic empire, the Ottoman
<br>
Empire, picked the losing side during WW1, and the French and British
<br>
grabbed the left-overs; they then carved them up into western-style
<br>
nations and installed puppet monarchies.
<br>
<p>(With me so far?)
<br>
<p>With a modicum of political and social development, some of those nations
<br>
held revolutions and kicked out the kings, in some cases replacing them
<br>
with more or less democratic republics. A few monarchies survived, either
<br>
by brutal repression (Arabia) or by constitutionalising themselves along 
<br>
British lines (Jordan, very approximately). The power vacuum also gave
<br>
rise to a specifically nation-building creed, Ba'athism -- which, however,
<br>
was crippled by (a) its nostalgia for pan-arabism (the happy family shtick:
<br>
except each Ba'ath party thought _it_ was the head of the household, so
<br>
they tended to squabble), and (b) the fact that Ba'athism was, structurally
<br>
speaking, a reincarnation of National Socialism (ick).
<br>
<p>Left to their own devices I suspect the Middle East would by now be a mess
<br>
of developing nations along the lines of South America. But two factors
<br>
came along to destabilize the region: oil, and the Cold War.
<br>
<p>The need to protect western nations' oil supplies caused successive 
<br>
intervention in the region -- first, the British/French Suez affair, in
<br>
which the USA basically ended up threatening Britain and France with 
<br>
economic sanctions if they didn't pull out, and then a variety of low-
<br>
key machinations by the US, moving into the power vacuum left by the former
<br>
European colonial powers. These included some very dubious affairs -- such
<br>
as the overthrow of a democratic government in Iran and its replacement
<br>
with a hereditary dictatorship, support for some of the more barking-
<br>
mad neo-Nazi Ba'athists (such as Saddam Hussein) and reactionary Feudal
<br>
monarchs (such as Saud) and so on. Respect for human rights wasn't on the
<br>
agenda during this period of the cold war, and it built up a bitter legacy
<br>
of resentment because &quot;securing the west's oil lifeline&quot; actually involved
<br>
destroying all hope for democracy in the region.
<br>
<p>The suicide fanatics of Al Qaida are basically the end-product of a
<br>
whole generation of the disposessed -- young men (growing population,
<br>
y'know) who see nothing but corruption among their national leaders,
<br>
who have no hope for direct political involvement (demonstrators tend to
<br>
be shot, there is no freedom of speech in much of the Middle East) and
<br>
who think their own culture is being submerged by that of the repugnant
<br>
aliens who've squashed all hope of political or economic development in
<br>
their own countries.
<br>
<p>The point you need to bear in mind is that these guys are a minority,
<br>
even in the Middle East. A small minority. And a good way of pulling the
<br>
rug out from under their feet would be to take a hard look at ethics in
<br>
foreign policy. Supporting any damn neo-Nazi regime or feudal monarchy
<br>
just because it's good for business may, well, be good for business, but
<br>
ultimately it builds up a charge of resentment that if you're not lucky
<br>
will find its way to you, rather than to the more appropriate targets
<br>
(the neo-Nazi dictatorships and those feudal Monarchies).
