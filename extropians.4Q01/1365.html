The threads &quot;BIOTERRORISM: Our heads in the sand...&quot;,
<br>
and &quot;Humans doomed without space colonies, says
<br>
Hawking&quot; give birth to this one.
<br>
<p>A google search for babylon gun, from the
<br>
&quot;BIOTERRORISM&quot; thread  gives
<br>
<p>At
<br>
<a href="http://www.friends-partners.org/mwade/lvs/babongun.htm">http://www.friends-partners.org/mwade/lvs/babongun.htm</a>
<br>
<p>and 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/other/supergun.htm">http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/other/supergun.htm</a>
<br>
<p>wherein we find launch costs estimated at $600/Kg (in
<br>
1990 dollars) for a 200 kg payload.  I
<br>
believe--someone care to confirm?--that this is
<br>
substantially cheaper than than current launch costs
<br>
using conventional, ie multistage rockets, methods.
<br>
<p>It would seem to me that for any payload capable of
<br>
withstanding the rigors of such a launch method--bulk
<br>
payloads of food, water, fuel, and building materials
<br>
immediately come to mind--the economic advantages of
<br>
gun launch present a striking commercial opportunity. 
<br>
Additionally, and logically, for anyone interested in
<br>
more human activity in space, a dual-mode launch
<br>
strategy, based on the complementarity of gun and
<br>
rocket launch methods, would seem a promising means to
<br>
that end.
<br>
<p>So I have to ask, &quot;Where's the problem?. Why hasn't
<br>
anyone done this?&quot;
<br>
<p>Also,  sometime back I read that the PV solar panels
<br>
for the Internation Space Station generate 65 kw and
<br>
cost $500,000,000.  Now I can't verify the accuracy of
<br>
that number--I no longer remember where I read it--but
<br>
I recall thinking that half a billion dollars for 65
<br>
kw seemed a bit much, and it got me to thinking about
<br>
low-tech power generation in space.  Specifically, I
<br>
envisioned, as the basis for such a system, a
<br>
parabolic dish made of minimum thickness  styrofoam
<br>
and coated with a film of appropriate reflective
<br>
material.
<br>
<p>For comparison purposes, at 10% conversion efficiency,
<br>
and 1300 watts/sq meter, you can get 65 kw out of a
<br>
dish a mere 13m in radius.  (And a dish of 100m radius
<br>
delivers a healthy 4 mega watts.)
<br>
<p>Two immediate obsevations.  Weightlessness would seem
<br>
to allow an EXTREMELY large dish, and the hard vacuum
<br>
of space seems to suggest that the reflective surface
<br>
would not be subject to oxidative degradation.  
<br>
<p>As to size, anyone care to suggest how big is too big
<br>
and why?
<br>
<p>I envision the dish as spin stabilized to keep it
<br>
pointed at the sun, with steam generator, and dual,
<br>
counter-rotating turbine/generator units axially
<br>
mounted, and the waste heat radiator located in the
<br>
shadow behind the dish.  
<br>
<p>I have a nifty little idea for the design of that
<br>
radiator.  A conical 'balloon', perhaps
<br>
stiffened/stabilized with an axial mast, into which
<br>
the exhaust steam is vented.  As it condenses, the
<br>
spin of the system will send the droplets toward the
<br>
inner surface of the balloon where the 'slope' will
<br>
cause the liquid to flow back to the rim of the dish
<br>
for reinjection to the steam generator.
<br>
<p>My engineering background always makes low-tech and
<br>
cheap more appealing than high-tech and expensive.
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm just talking out my asteroid, but hey, I'm
<br>
havin' fun.
<br>
<p>Ball's in your court.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
