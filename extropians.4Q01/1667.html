<p>Actually, a surprising amount of that work is already not directly
<br>
paid for by the end user. Rafal, when you publish your papers in
<br>
certain journals, *you* pay a small fee for the priviledge of doing
<br>
so, don't you? If you could choose to make your paper available for
<br>
free online to anybody who wants it, wouldn't you choose to do so on
<br>
the premise that it would increase the number of times you are cited
<br>
by colleagues?
<br>
<p>### Scientific journals are so very different from MP3's. The main source of
<br>
funding for their content providers is the government. The main producers of
<br>
the added value of the journals are the usually unpaid peer reviewers. Yet
<br>
most of the income generated from them goes to the publishers. This is a
<br>
perverse system. Personally I would be happy if the few articles I authored
<br>
were freely downloadable but without the cachet of a peer-review board and
<br>
the brand name of an authority to support them, they would be less valuable.
<br>
I hope that some day the age of the $ 5000 subscription fee to a journal
<br>
will be over, with cheaper electronic journals replacing existing paper
<br>
ones. Their content will not be adversely affected by downloading as long as
<br>
there are scientists willing to publish and review, and institutions willing
<br>
to fund them.
<br>
<p>One method to get there faster would be for the sponsors of science, to
<br>
require that all the sponsored work be made freely available and to actually
<br>
prohibit the transfer of copyright to other entities. If the NIH instituted
<br>
such a requirement, all bioscience journals would have to adapt to survive,
<br>
and the overhead of doing science would be lowered.
