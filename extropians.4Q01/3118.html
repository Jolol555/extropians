I think transhumanist goals would be advanced better if the list paid more
<br>
attention to the  radical bioconservativism's progress via the Bush
<br>
administration, for instance in the case of bioethicist in chief Leon
<br>
Kass. - J. Hughes

<br>
<p>Irrationalist in Chief
<br>
by Chris Mooney
<br>
<p>We, on the other hand, with our dissection of cadavers, organ
<br>
transplantation, cosmetic surgery, body shops, laboratory fertilization,
<br>
surrogate wombs, gender-change surgery, &quot;wanted&quot; children, &quot;rights over our
<br>
bodies,&quot; sexual liberation, and other practices and beliefs that insist on
<br>
our independence and autonomy, live more and more wholly for the here and
<br>
now, subjugating everything we can to the exercise of our wills, with little
<br>
respect for the nature and meaning of bodily life.
<br>
--Leon R. Kass, Toward a More Natural Science
<br>
<p>It's probably a lucky thing for Leon Kass, the conservative University of
<br>
Chicago ethics philosopher appointed to head George W. Bush's new Council on
<br>
Bioethics, that his position doesn't require Senate confirmation. Last
<br>
April, the neocon Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer effused that
<br>
Kass should be named surgeon general, a post that does require confirmation,
<br>
but that might have backfired: Kass has a paper trail that would put any
<br>
quotation-hunting opposition researcher in hack heaven. Virginia Postrel,
<br>
editor-at-large of Reason magazine, has already bloodied Kass considerably
<br>
by drawing attention to a passage from his 1985 book Toward a More Natural
<br>
Science in which Kass complains about &quot;our dissection of cadavers.&quot; Writing
<br>
in the Los Angeles Times, Postrel observed: &quot;This isn't about the 21st
<br>
century. It's about the 16th.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the same book, Kass--who over the years has opposed or at least fretted
<br>
about virtually every new reproductive technology, from in vitro
<br>
fertilization to cloning--refers to abortion as &quot;feticide.&quot; Indeed, in his
<br>
writings Kass frequently sounds more like a partisan culture warrior than a
<br>
philosopher king, as in his 1997 New Republic anticloning article &quot;The
<br>
Wisdom of Repugnance&quot;:
<br>
<p>Thanks to feminism and the gay rights movement, we are increasingly
<br>
encouraged to treat the natural heterosexual difference and its preeminence
<br>
as a matter of &quot;cultural construction.&quot;
<br>
At times, he can even recall a Moral Majority theocrat like Jerry Falwell.
<br>
In a 1990 speech at the Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank, Kass
<br>
wondered:
<br>
<p>Could it be that something like piety--familial, civil, religious--is a
<br>
crucial ingredient in the most responsive moral souls? And what of the
<br>
others? Do we not need the development of laws and customs with proper
<br>
sanctions--logoi with teeth--to help guide those not amenable to persuasion?
<br>
Kass can't be simply reduced to his more extreme side, but it's remarkable
<br>
that despite this background, his philosophical outlook has been deeply
<br>
misunderstood or altogether missed by many commentators. On a mid-August
<br>
installment of CBS's Face the Nation, for example, host Bob Schieffer
<br>
introduced Kass as a &quot;scientist.&quot; Kass does have a Ph.D. in biochemistry,
<br>
along with an M.D., but he doesn't do research or see patients. Instead,
<br>
he's long been ensconced as a rather arch classics buff at the University of
<br>
Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, with stints at the American
<br>
Enterprise Institute. &quot;He's not a scientist,&quot; says Arthur Caplan, a longtime
<br>
Kass acquaintance and director of the Center for Bioethics at the University
<br>
of Pennsylvania. &quot;He hasn't gone near a lab in 20 years.&quot; (Kass was
<br>
contacted by the Prospect but isn't granting interviews.)
<br>
<p>In fact, Kass's explicit turn away from a life of research links his
<br>
cultural conservatism to his deep distrust of new technologies. Kass was
<br>
disturbed not only by the alleged moral promiscuity of the 1960s but also by
<br>
the decade's great advances in human biological research. In her 1998 book
<br>
Clone, New York Times science writer Gina Kolata singles out Kass as a rare
<br>
figure who &quot;actually stopped doing biology and became a philosopher and
<br>
ethicist because of cloning.&quot; His conversion began in 1967, after he read a
<br>
Washington Post column by the Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist Joshua
<br>
Lederberg that, as Kass complained in a letter to the editor, took a &quot;casual
<br>
and cavalier&quot; approach to the topic. Soon, a morally queasy Kass quit his
<br>
job as a biochemist at the National Institutes of Health, teaming up with
<br>
the anticloning theologian Paul Ramsey and with Daniel Callahan and Willard
<br>
Gaylin, the founders of the Hastings Center. Rebels with a cause, Kass and
<br>
company cast themselves in direct opposition to biologists like Lederberg.
<br>
Much of their work was suffused with &quot;mad scientist&quot; innuendos. &quot;There were
<br>
a lot of scientists who thought that the bioethicists hated them,&quot; observes
<br>
Caplan.
<br>
<p>Since then, Kass has cornered the market on Revelations-style
<br>
prognostications about the threat of &quot;dehumanization&quot; through assisted
<br>
reproduction. Like any prophet, he has frequently been dead wrong. But when
<br>
it comes to his new public role, his particular stances on issues matter
<br>
less than how he conducts himself as the ostensibly fair-minded leader of a
<br>
national debate. Here's where Kass's record becomes truly alarming. In his
<br>
various crusades, Kass not only has recommended protecting life's &quot;most
<br>
magnificent mysteries&quot; from scientific research but has resorted to a
<br>
variety of anti-intellectual techniques, ranging from scare-mongering to
<br>
downright obscurantism. He also hasn't always been willing to engage
<br>
viewpoints radically different from his own. It's this combination of
<br>
dogmatism and intellectually propped-up irrationalism--with its distrust of
<br>
modern science and frequent appeals to a religiously based morality that not
<br>
all Americans can feel and access--that makes Kass such a troubling choice
<br>
to guide a pluralistic discussion of bioethics.
<br>
<p>To understand Leon Kass, it helps to delve into the past few decades of
<br>
internecine struggles in the burbling field of bioethics. The term bioethics
<br>
itself was coined only in the early 1970s. Originally, the field grew in
<br>
response to shocking revelations of exploitive human-subject research--most
<br>
notoriously the Tuskegee, Alabama, syphilis study, in which black men over a
<br>
period of four decades were denied penicillin so that researchers could
<br>
observe the disease's advanced effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the outset, however, bioethics' public face was also intimately linked
</em><br>
to in vitro fertilization and to Kass's obsession, the cloning issue. This
<br>
was in part thanks to a much-hyped 1972 New York Times Magazine cover story
<br>
by Hastings Center co-founder Willard Gaylin titled &quot;The Frankenstein Myth
<br>
Becomes a Reality--We Have the Awful Knowledge to Make Exact Copies of Human
<br>
Beings.&quot; In Kolata's Clone, Gaylin and Daniel Callahan more or less admit
<br>
that the article (published fully 25 years before the unprecedented birth of
<br>
Dolly, the cloned sheep) was a publicity stunt for the newly launched
<br>
Hastings Center.
<br>
<p>In the early days, bioethics and religion commingled frequently: Indeed,
<br>
they merged seamlessly in the towering figure of the Princeton theologian
<br>
Paul Ramsey. Gaylin's attempt to stoke Frankensteinian fears of mad
<br>
scientists &quot;playing God&quot; fit this tenor well. But since then, the field has
<br>
diversified and become captured, to a large extent, by secular academic
<br>
philosophy, which has relegated such flimsy &quot;playing God&quot; arguments to films
<br>
like Jurassic Park. This transformation is one that Kass--an observant Jew
<br>
with a deep scholarly interest in the Book of Genesis--has railed against
<br>
repeatedly. Indeed, in his 1990 Hastings Center speech, Kass complained:
<br>
<p>Most religious ethicists entering the public practice of ethics leave their
<br>
special religious insights at the door and talk about &quot;deontological vs.
<br>
consequentialist,&quot; &quot;autonomy vs. paternalism,&quot; &quot;justice vs. utility,&quot; just
<br>
like everybody else.
<br>
He concluded by exhorting his peers to
<br>
<p>return to what animated the enterprise: The fears, the hopes, the
<br>
repugnances, the moral concern, and above all, the recognition that beneath
<br>
the distinctive issues of bioethics lie the deepest matters of our humanity.
<br>
<p>But there's a strong case to be made that bioethics is moving in the right
<br>
direction, though it's still a hodgepodge that generally lacks the
<br>
professional training standards and academic-peer-review processes
<br>
characteristic of more long-standing disciplines. After all, though the
<br>
members of the original Hastings Center crowd were visionaries, they were at
<br>
times also less devoted to reasoned persuasion than to stirring up the
<br>
public's emotional response. Decades later, Kass still employs this
<br>
technique. &quot;There's a certain political use of bioethics that's about
<br>
legitimating fundamental 'yuck' reactions that some people have,&quot; observes
<br>
Sheila Jasanoff, a professor of science and public policy at Harvard
<br>
University's Kennedy School of Government. &quot;That's why the whole idea of
<br>
making bioethics into an expert field is problematic. It elevates some
<br>
people's 'yuck' reactions into an expert viewpoint that others can't easily
<br>
challenge.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kass has actually gone further: He has crafted and promulgated, as a core
<br>
aspect of his philosophy, an entire pseudo-intellectual defense of &quot;yuck&quot;
<br>
reactions, which he terms &quot;the wisdom of repugnance.&quot; Kass's eponymous 1997
<br>
anticloning article in the New Republic is a grand piece of
<br>
anti-intellectualism, complete with digs at &quot;philosophical cleverness&quot; and
<br>
&quot;philosophisms.&quot; To a large degree, this was a way of covering up the fact
<br>
that Kass didn't have a rational argument. &quot;Repugnance,&quot; he contended, &quot;is
<br>
the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power to express
<br>
it.&quot; And again: &quot;We are repelled by the prospect of cloning human beings not
<br>
because of the strangeness or novelty of the undertaking, but because we
<br>
intuit and feel, immediately and without argument, the violation of things
<br>
that we rightfully hold dear.&quot;
<br>
<p>A sampling of what some academic ethicists think of this &quot;reasoning&quot; shows
<br>
how far afield Kass really is. &quot;In my view, it doesn't have any intellectual
<br>
content,&quot; comments Brown University bioethics philosopher Dan Brock. The
<br>
medical ethicist and former Syracuse University dean of arts and sciences
<br>
Samuel Gorovitz, who debated Kass as early as the 1970s, elaborates:
<br>
&quot;Feelings are signals, they are signals worthy of respect. But what one then
<br>
must do is ask in what the repugnance is rooted, and is it something that
<br>
one might be well advised to overcome?&quot; After all, lots of people feel
<br>
repugnance toward, say, interracial marriage. But we don't automatically
<br>
condone their repugnance, much less cite it as a basis for public policy,
<br>
the way Kass does with cloning.
<br>
<p>Kass does attempt to make some arguments in &quot;The Wisdom of Repugnance&quot; but
<br>
candidly admits that cloning &quot;is finally one of those instances about which
<br>
the heart has its reasons that reason cannot entirely know.&quot; This Pascalian
<br>
statement, coupled with Kass's frequent dogmatic pronouncements about what
<br>
constitutes &quot;natural&quot; reproduction, show him to be essentially more preacher
<br>
than thinker. Kass happily puts forward an anticloning argument that has no
<br>
justification and by definition can't have any--it's rooted only in deeply
<br>
set emotion, or, if you will, faith. Furthermore, says Kass, if you don't
<br>
feel that emotion then there's something wrong with you: &quot;Shallow are the
<br>
souls that have forgotten how to shudder.&quot;
<br>
<p>Passages like this have led the Princeton molecular biologist Lee Silver,
<br>
author of Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World and another
<br>
frequent Kass debater, to accuse him of sectarian reasoning (and Silver's
<br>
far from the only accuser). &quot;When I give ['The Wisdom of Repugnance'] to my
<br>
students to read in my course here at Princeton,&quot; notes Silver, &quot;I say,
<br>
'This is a paper in which Kass claims to be giving his secular point of
<br>
view.' And the students all read it and say, 'This is thinly veiled
<br>
religion.'&quot; Silver points out that Bush could never have gotten away with
<br>
appointing a Catholic bishop to head his Council on Bioethics; yet in Kass
<br>
he gets more or less the same thing, down to the natural law-style
<br>
theorizing--but with an M.D. and Ph.D. conveniently included to throw
<br>
everyone off the trail.
<br>
<p>It's important to note that the objection is not that Kass has religious
<br>
views, but that he thinks it's fine to base his arguments on them when
<br>
making policy recommendations for a pluralistic society. Contrast this, as
<br>
Virginia Postrel does, with the noted Rice University bioethicist Tristram
<br>
Engelhardt, Jr. Engelhardt is an Orthodox Christian who edits the journal
<br>
Christian Bioethics. But he also knows what it means to advance bioethical
<br>
theories that must suit a nation composed of diverse viewpoints, arguing:
<br>
&quot;If all do not listen to God so as to be united in one religion ... , the
<br>
only source of common moral authority among moral strangers will be
<br>
consent.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's not the course Kass takes; nor is he guilty only of masking religious
<br>
premises in argument. He's guilty as well of cultivating public phobias
<br>
about new technologies. One of Kass's primary intellectual influences is the
<br>
rather obscure German philosopher Hans Jonas, who's perhaps best known for
<br>
his early denunciation of Martin Heidegger, his former teacher, for
<br>
supporting Hitler. But Jonas was also one of the first bioethicists, who
<br>
advocated a &quot;heuristics of fear&quot; to help stave off biomedical advance.
<br>
According to Jonas, bioethicists ought to employ a &quot;comparative futurology&quot;
<br>
of possible sci-fi horror stories, because we humans need &quot;a threat to the
<br>
image of man to assure ourselves of his true image by the very recoil from
<br>
these threats.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jonas considered this demagoguery &quot;bioethical&quot;--though whether it's just
<br>
plain ethical is dubious. Yet fear-mongering has been one of Kass's favored
<br>
techniques. While at times he quotes Plato and Aristotle, Kass has more
<br>
frequently argued on the basis of Brave New World, threatening that in vitro
<br>
fertilization and human cloning will lead to a world of Aldous Huxley's
<br>
&quot;hatcheries&quot; and genetic underclasses. In his 1998 book Frankenstein's
<br>
Footsteps: Science, Genetics, and Popular Culture, Jon Turney, chair of
<br>
science and technology studies at the University College of London, remarks
<br>
that Kass and Paul Ramsey both borrowed ideas from Brave New World to
<br>
challenge in vitro fertilization in the early 1970s--Kass in the New England
<br>
Journal of Medicine and Ramsey in the Journal of the American Medical
<br>
Association. &quot;Both these bioethicists, writing in the two leading American
<br>
medical journals, drew on fictional associations of external fertilisation
<br>
to reinforce a slippery slope argument against the technique,&quot; writes
<br>
Turney. But fiction is just that--fiction. It's questionable whether Kass's
<br>
speculative futurism counts as a responsible, or even helpful, approach to
<br>
bioethical dilemmas.
<br>
<p>And if Kass can't be expected to lead a hysteria-free debate on bioethics,
<br>
there are also grounds for doubting whether he'll lead an intellectually
<br>
balanced one. He told CBS's Schieffer that his council will &quot;most
<br>
emphatically contain people of different voices&quot;; and Kass's friend William
<br>
Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, attests that Kass &quot;is serious when
<br>
he says he wants a diversity of opinions.&quot; But there's diversity, and then
<br>
there's diversity. Consider the much publicized July 9 meeting between Bush,
<br>
Kass, and Daniel Callahan to discuss stem cells--a meeting that Bush's
<br>
handlers now say crucially shaped the president's decision. Kass was asked
<br>
to tap another bioethicist as his counterpoint, so the president would hear
<br>
a range of views. He chose Callahan. The media approved of the choice
<br>
because Callahan is a Democrat and (before founding the Hastings Center)
<br>
edited the liberal Catholic magazine Commonweal.
<br>
<p>What no one noticed is that party lines blur beyond recognition on
<br>
bioethical issues, and several bioethicists say that they knew as soon as
<br>
Callahan's name was mentioned that Bush wouldn't hear any real dissent.
<br>
&quot;Callahan on these issues is fairly close to Kass,&quot; comments Syracuse's
<br>
Gorovitz, &quot;and everybody who knows the field would have expected that.&quot;
<br>
Callahan counters that he and Kass had not compared notes before meeting
<br>
with Bush and that when it comes to stem cells, &quot;having written nothing on
<br>
the subject, nobody can say I went in there with a well-known position.&quot; In
<br>
fact, Callahan told me that he opposes embryonic-stem-cell experimentation
<br>
even more strenuously than Kass does--which means that at the allegedly
<br>
pivotal Bush stem cell meeting, the president didn't hear a single defender
<br>
of the research.
<br>
<p>Kass engineered this supposedly &quot;diverse&quot; debate--one possible reason for
<br>
his claiming lately that he has no position on stem cells. That may be
<br>
officially true, but it's pretty easy to figure out where he is headed. As
<br>
far back as 1979, Kass wrote that &quot;it is difficult to justify submitting [an
<br>
early-stage embryo] to invasive experiments, and especially difficult to
<br>
justify creating it solely for the purpose of experimentation [his
<br>
emphasis].&quot; Predicts Arthur Caplan: &quot;I'm willing to say, as a matter of
<br>
inference, that you're going to have to prove to him why stem cell research
<br>
might be ethical. That I absolutely believe--and I hate to say it, but I
<br>
don't care what Leon says.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another anecdote would also seem to belie the claim that Kass's council will
<br>
seek out radically different viewpoints--particularly secular or utilitarian
<br>
ones. Jack Hitt, a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine, recounts a
<br>
run-in with Kass back when Hitt was a senior editor of Harper's magazine.
<br>
Hitt invited Kass to participate in a &quot;Harper's Forum&quot; on assisted suicide;
<br>
another participant was to be Jack Kevorkian. When Kass heard this, he told
<br>
Hitt he would never discuss the right to die with Kevorkian or even sit at
<br>
the same table with him. Hitt elaborates by e-mail: &quot;When I tried to
<br>
convince [Kass] that Kevorkian's actions were defining the debate far more
<br>
powerfully than the ethicists' theories precisely because the twain had not
<br>
met, he snorted and told me I was part of the problem. The Madisonian idea
<br>
... of a marketplace in which good ideas will eventually chase off bad ones
<br>
is lost on him.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's not a great recommendation for someone who's supposed to help a
<br>
diverse nation navigate the tricky ethical waters of issues like stem cell
<br>
research and human cloning. At bottom, Kass's appointment raises the
<br>
question of whether we can expect a national bioethics debate or a national
<br>
bioethics sermon. Granted, the &quot;field&quot; of bioethics itself hasn't really
<br>
resolved its own identity yet, and for every Samuel Gorovitz or Tristram
<br>
Engelhardt there's a Carrie Gordon Earll--the &quot;bioethics analyst&quot; for Focus
<br>
on the Family, who begins a typical article: &quot;After more than a dozen years
<br>
working around bioethical or life issues, one of my favorite Scripture
<br>
verses... .&quot; In Leon Kass, bioethics has put forward a minority figure who
<br>
comes down, like Earll, on the side of sermons--a sixteenth-century
<br>
sensibility to guide us through twenty-first-century conundrums.
