<p>
El duende. Does it exist? Perhaps. And 'where' is it?
<br>
Is it an attractor? Is it a useful hypothesis?
<br>
Something to do with non-computability (1) of
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity (2)? Was Nietzsche in search
<br>
of duende?
<br>
<p>Federico Garcia Lorca wrote (3, 4) in ŒTeoria y Juego
<br>
del Duende¹, ŒPlay and Theory of Duende¹, Madrid, 1933,
<br>
that every man, and every artist, climbs each step,
<br>
in the tower of his perfection, by fighting his duende,
<br>
not his angel, nor his muse. Because angels and muses
<br>
escape with violin, meter, and compass: the duende wounds.
<br>
<p>But there are neither maps, nor disciplines, to help us
<br>
find the duende. The duende lives in the remotest mansions
<br>
of the blood. We only know that he burns the blood like
<br>
a poultice of broken glass, that he rejects all the
<br>
geometry we have learned, that he smashes styles.
<br>
With idea, sound or gesture, the duende 'enjoys'
<br>
fighting the creator on the very rim of the well.
<br>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary gives, for duende:
<br>
ghost, evil spirit, inspiration, magic, fire.
<br>
But this old term was also used by Andalusians (and
<br>
Calderòn de la Barca) to describe artists (or women)
<br>
whose music, or dance, (or spirit), was especially
<br>
inspired: Œthis has much duende¹. 'The most elusive
<br>
word in the Spanish language is duende. Like a breeze
<br>
or moonlight, it is more easily experienced than
<br>
explained' wrote Rod Usher.
<br>
<p>Garcia Lorca reports what Goethe, speaking about
<br>
Paganini performing concerts, once (perhaps) said:
<br>
&lt;mysterious power which everyone senses and no
<br>
philosopher explains&gt;.
<br>
<p>'This &lt;mysterious power which everyone senses and not
<br>
philosopher explains&gt; is, in sum, the spirit of the earth,
<br>
the same duende that scorched the heart of Nietzsche, who
<br>
searched in vain for its external forms on the Rialto
<br>
Bridge and in the music of Bizet, without knowing that
<br>
the duende he was pursuing had leaped straight from the
<br>
Greek mysteries to the dancers of Cadiz (...)'.
<br>
<p>'El duende ... Where is el duende? Through the empty
<br>
arch comes a wind, a mental wind blowing relentlessly
<br>
over the heads of the dead, in search of new landscapes
<br>
and unknown accents; a wind that smells of child's spittle,
<br>
crushed grass, and jellyfish veil, announcing the constant
<br>
baptism of newly created things'.
<br>
<p>'All that has black sounds has duende' wrote Manuel Torre,
<br>
famous 'cantaor' flamenco. 'Behind those black sounds,
<br>
tenderly and intimately, live zephyrs, ants, volcanoes,
<br>
and the huge night, straining its waist against the
<br>
Milky Way', added Garcia Lorca.
<br>
<p>'I have heard an old maestro of guitar saying,
<br>
&lt;The duende is not in the throat; the duende
<br>
climbs up inside you, from the soles of the feet&gt;'.
<br>
<p>'The duende, then, is a power, not a work. It is a
<br>
struggle, not a thought'.
<br>
<p><p>(1) It can be shown that no unique algorithm
<br>
can generate the shortest program for computing
<br>
arbitrary, but given, data on a given computer.

<br>
any more than do the forms of the sea during a squall'.
