America's Disgraceful History Of Military &quot;Trials&quot;
<br>
by Thomas J. DiLorenzo
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo9.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo9.html</a>
<br>
<p>The latest assault on the civil liberties of the American people in the name
<br>
of fighting terrorism is President Bush's recent decision to use U.S.
<br>
military tribunals to try foreigners accused of terrorist attacks and to
<br>
decide on sentences, including the death penalty.  This is a horrible idea
<br>
with a horrible precedent: the largest mass execution in U.S. history.
<br>
<p>In 1851 the Santee Sioux Indians in Minnesota sold twenty-four million acres
<br>
of land to the federal government for $1.4 million. By August of 1862
<br>
thousands of white settlers continued to pour into the Indian lands even
<br>
though none of the money had been paid to the Santee Sioux. There was a crop
<br>
failure that year, and the Indians were starving. The Lincoln administration
<br>
refused to pay them the money they were owed, breaking yet another Indian
<br>
treaty, and the starving Sioux revolted.
<br>
<p>A short &quot;war&quot; ensued, with Lincoln putting one of his favorite generals,
<br>
General John Pope, in charge of federal forces in Minnesota. Pope announced
<br>
that &quot;It is my purpose to utterly exterminate the Sioux . . . . They are to
<br>
be treated as maniacs or wild beasts, and by no means as people with whom
<br>
treaties or compromise can be made.&quot; (Similar statements were being made at
<br>
the time by General William Tecumseh Sherman, who said that to all Southern
<br>
secessionists, &quot;why, death is mercy&quot;).
<br>
<p>The Santee Sioux were overwhelmed by the federal army by October of 1862, at
<br>
which time General Pope held hundreds of Indian men, women, and children who
<br>
were considered to be prisoners of war. The men were all herded into forts
<br>
where military &quot;trials&quot; were held, each of which lasted about ten minutes
<br>
according to David A. Nichols in _Lincoln and the Indians_. They were all
<br>
found guilty of murder and sentenced to death even though the lack of hard
<br>
evidence was manifest and they were not given any semblance of a proper
<br>
defense. Most were condemned to death by virtue of the fact that they were
<br>
merely present during a battle, during a declared (by the Indians) war.
<br>
<p>Minnesota political authorities wanted the federal army to immediately
<br>
execute all 303 of the condemned men. Lincoln, however, was concerned that
<br>
such a mass execution of so many men who had so obviously been railroaded
<br>
would be looked upon in a bad light by the European powers who, at the time,
<br>
were threatening to support the Confederate cause in the War for Southern
<br>
Independence. His compromise was to pare the list of condemned down to 39,
<br>
with a promise to the Minnesota political establishment that the federal
<br>
army would eventually kill or remove every last Indian from the state. As a
<br>
sweetener to the deal Lincoln also offered Minnesota $2 million in federal
<br>
funds.
<br>
<p>On December 26, 1862, Abraham Lincoln ordered the largest mass execution in
<br>
American history in which the guilt of the executed could not be positively
<br>
determined beyond reasonable doubt.  (The cartel of &quot;Lincoln scholars&quot;
<br>
actually praises Lincoln for this act, claiming that it is yet another
<br>
example of his humanitarianism and his &quot;culture of life.&quot; He may well have
<br>
killed 39 innocent people, they say, but it could have been much worse).
<br>
<p>This is not to suggest that the Bush administration, with its decision to
<br>
use military tribunals instead of civil courts to try suspected terrorists,
<br>
will exercise the kind of tyrannical behavior that occurred during the
<br>
Lincoln administration, but it could.  Military men who are influenced by
<br>
the passions of war are not suitable as unbiased judges.  The administration
<br>
should use the current crisis as an opportunity to speed up our sclerotic
<br>
legal system and prosecute accused terrorists under the normal rules of
<br>
trials that are consistent with the U.S. Constitution.

<br>
an Unnecessary War_, will be published in February.
