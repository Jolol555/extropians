Damien B forwards:
<br>
<em>&gt; In his recent paper, &quot;There Are No Limits To The Open Society&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tkpw/tcr/volume-03/number-02/node1.html">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tkpw/tcr/volume-03/number-02/node1.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tipler suggests that oscillative nudging by self aware observers will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to take advantage of chaos theory to produce an Omega Point.
</em><br>
<p>and adds:
<br>
<em>&gt; It's not that recent (1998), which was before the apparent acceleration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cosmos was discovered. But it's a neat summary for newcomers. And see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the technical appendix on why there *must* be an Omega Point (unitarity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violation otherwise):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tkpw/tcr/volume-03/number-02/node2.html">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tkpw/tcr/volume-03/number-02/node2.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting now that the evidence seems strong for an open universe
<br>
to look at Tipler's argument for why the universe &quot;must&quot; be closed.
<br>
Basically it is so that black holes will not evaporate.  If a black hole
<br>
evaporates, then information is lost.  But a basic principle of QM is
<br>
that information is never lost, that in principle you can reconstruct
<br>
the past from the future.  Thus black hole evaporation is a mystery
<br>
which seems to violate the laws of physics.
<br>
<p>Now the conventional &quot;explanation&quot; is to simply say that we won't really
<br>
know what will happen until we have a good theory of quantum gravity,
<br>
which we don't have.  But we have faith that with that theory in hand,
<br>
the mystery will be solved.  Either black holes won't fully evaporate
<br>
(maybe some kind of kernel will be left behind that might be like a new
<br>
form of elementary particle but which holds all of the information that
<br>
fell into the black hole), or maybe the evaporation won't be random but
<br>
will somehow encode the information that fell in, or something else.
<br>
<p>But Tipler's explanation is to say that black holes won't evaporate,
<br>
because the universe won't last long enough.  In fact he says that the
<br>
universe MUST be of finite duration otherwise black holes would evaporate
<br>
which would violate our current understanding of the laws of physics.
<br>
<p>I think in retrospect that this is not a very strong argument.  If you
<br>
have a theory which would produce a contradiction if X happens, then you
<br>
can try to solve it by saying that X will never happen.  But if there is
<br>
no a priori reason to believe that X can't happen, it looks pretty ad hoc.
<br>
<p>Besides, there are some theories that mini black holes could have been
<br>
produced early in the universe which would have evaporated long ago, and
<br>
so Tipler has to deny that this could happen as well.  It really doesn't
<br>
seem likely that the universe is engaged in a conspiracy to prevent black
<br>
holes from evaporating just because our present understanding of the laws
<br>
of nature produces contradictory predictions about what would happen then.
