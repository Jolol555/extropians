</em><br>
<p>Excuse me? I think you misunderstand the meaning of the term moral
<br>
relativism. In the above citation (in fact, the entire post), I claim
<br>
certain behaviors are unacceptable because they go against the rights of
<br>
others. That is not moral relativism at all - I make a claim that there
<br>
exist ethical rights.  I *also* try to argue in the posting that this
<br>
position is also rational from a pragmatic perspective, but that is just
<br>
an additional argument intended to help convince certain readers here,
<br>
who seem to be moral relativists. 
<br>
<p>I have previously clearly stated that I view societies enabling various
<br>
freedoms as better than societies that doesn't, and the same goes for
<br>
individuals - which is very much anathema to moral relativism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quoting Deutsch:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Moral relativism always sees itself as evenhanded, and indeed it begins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with a retreat from judgement or taking sides. But in practice it always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entails siding with wrong against right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Western values are life-affirming and life-seeking. The murderers worship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; death. There is no symmetry between life and death. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would appear to me, that Anders needs to state clearly and precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at what point actions by individuals void their rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Do I void my rights by arguing that we should not be taxed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Do I void my rights by demonstrating against taxation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Do I void my rights by not paying my taxes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Do I void my rights by sabotaging efforts to collect taxes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Do I void my rights by assassinating the tax collectors?
</em><br>
<p>This is based on my ethical position:
<br>
<p>1) No, you do not void any rights by arguing anything. 
<br>
<p>2) No, you do not void any rights by demonstrating, as long as this
<br>
doesn't infringe on rights of others, for example by destroying
<br>
property. If you do, then your own right to property might be ethically
<br>
temporally circumscribed as you are fined for this behavior, but it is
<br>
neither completely abolished or permanently changed.
<br>
<p>3) This depends on whether you have entered a contract with the
<br>
government or not (currently most governments simply decide that you
<br>
have, no matter what you say; whether you accept their claim as ethical
<br>
or not is up to you). If you have no contract, then not paying taxes is
<br>
OK. If you have a contract, then not paying taxes is a breach of
<br>
contract and should be handled as such. Note that this may not be an
<br>
ethical issue - being known to honor contracts is good for you, but you
<br>
do not have to maintain your reputation if you want.
<br>
<p>4) If you sabotage efforts to collect taxes the issue is whether you
<br>
infringe on any rights of anybody else (including the tax collector or
<br>
the people who have pooled resources into the government and hence &quot;own&quot;
<br>
it). If it is just about your taxes and their collection, then 3
<br>
applies. If you try to interfere with the collection of taxes from other
<br>
people, then you might be interfering in their contracts with the
<br>
government and hence ethically should be fined or possibly have
<br>
reductions in your freedom (if you interfere with the freedom of
<br>
others). 
<br>
<p>5) The tax collector has a right to defend itself; by initiating force
<br>
you void your right to not be attacked. Others also have an ethical
<br>
right (or even duty) to assist the tax collector. Note that this does
<br>
not necessarily mean your right to life has been permanently voided or
<br>
that it is ethically OK to kill you - if you can instead be captured it
<br>
is ethically preferrable to killing you.
<br>
<p>To sum up, rights only get voided when actions make your rights
<br>
interfere with the rights of others, and even then the decrease in
<br>
rights is partial, temporary and ideally should be minimal. 
<br>
<p>Does this really sound like moral relativism to you? It is essentially a
<br>
vanilla libertarian rights perspective. 
<br>
<p>It is worth noting that my view of government is that it should be a
<br>
kind of corporation owned by its citizens - it is a pooling of resources
<br>
and administration for common goals. It might be given ethical duties
<br>
such as policing. Current governments go far beyond this and often claim
<br>
ethical independence from the citizens, so it is not always obvious what
<br>
actions are unacceptable visavi the government because they are breaches
<br>
of the implicit social contract (hence I prefer literal social
<br>
contracts). 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The complement of this is -- what rights should agents of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority have against agents of minorities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If such agents of a minority are known to have and be committed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an agenda that promotes and executes actions that destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent lives, is it unreasonable to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - subject such individuals to drugs that would encourage them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   divulge their knowledge of such behaviors (otherwise leaving them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   unharmed)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - subject such individuals to painful methods of torture that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   would encourage them to disclose knowledge they had but would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   not permanently harm such individuals?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From my ethical perspective it doesn't matter whether you belong to a
</em><br>
minority or the majority, your rights are *yours* and should not be
<br>
changed because you belong to a certain group. Also, as long as you do
<br>
not violate the rights of others others have no right to violate your
<br>
rights. Hence pre-emptive drugging or torture is not ethically
<br>
acceptable - they might be acceptable (although even here I have my
<br>
doubts) if you have done such a violation or there is sufficient reason
<br>
to suspect you for it (but it better be a *very* good reason, and if it
<br>
turns out to be wrong compensation should be paid). 
<br>
<p>Why isn't this acceptable? Because the non-initiation of force is
<br>
paramount of maintaining a voluntary society where individuals can
<br>
pursuse happiness in freedom and security. By initiating force
<br>
individually, we place ourselves above the other, reducing their
<br>
freedoms and rights, possibly disrupting their life projects. But the
<br>
value of life projects cannot be compared with each other since they are
<br>
inherently subjective and tied to the person doing them - it is not
<br>
possible to tell whether the value of person A's religious contemplation
<br>
to himself is greater or lesser than the value of person B's economic
<br>
visions to herself.  If there is any point in my ethical position you
<br>
might call relativist it is this. But there are many other ways of
<br>
arguing the same thing not based on this Lockean scepticism. Just check
<br>
the liberal literature.
<br>
<p>By having a society that allows initiation of force, the supporters of
<br>
this society also become culpable of its acts (asusming this society was
<br>
voluntarily set up; in the current situation it is a more complex issue
<br>
of partial responsibility). Not only does it harm the rights of
<br>
individuals, but these individuals now have an ethical case against the
<br>
whole society. Since mistakes will occasionally be done, an initiation
<br>
policy will also mean that occasionally force will be initiated against
<br>
innocents (and due to the nature of societies, it is far more likely to
<br>
happen to a citizen than an outsider, so from a pragmatic point of view
<br>
it is also undesirable). And since you want to extend the ability to
<br>
initiate force not just against individuals but against groups these
<br>
individuals belong to you increase the likeliehood of innocents being
<br>
harmed enormously.
<br>
<p>So, what about a group that attacks an ethical society? In my ethical
<br>
position this is initiation of force, and the society is ethically right
<br>
to strike back. In the ensuing conflict it is likely that bystanders
<br>
will be hurt or killed, and reparations should be paid. But since the
<br>
goal of the fight is to redress a wrong and limit future occurences, it
<br>
is not acceptable to extend it to innocents unless it is unavoidable,
<br>
since that would only cause a new wrong. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I will readily admit that the problem is when there is sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence to justify such extreme measures be taken.  But we *know*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are individuals willing to sacrifice their lives and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lives of thousands of innocents for the sake of their most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably irrationally based meme-sets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To refute this it would seem to me that you have to justify that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holding any moral position -- even one that justifies and rationalizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the elimination of other moral positions is fundamentally justifiable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the terms Deutsch uses -- you have to justify why promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the survival of a &quot;wrong&quot; position is as extropic as promoting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival of a &quot;right&quot; position.
</em><br>
<p>We need diversity to grow. If only the &quot;right&quot; ideas are
<br>
allowed you will get orthodoxy and stasis rather than creativity. Having
<br>
many views available helps sharpen the discussion, provides necessary
<br>
criticism and efforts to find our which ideas fit reality best. 
<br>
<p>Popper said that we let our ideas die in our stead. The same goes with
<br>
tolerance: we should tolerate people as long as they sprout ideas but do
<br>
not kill people. That doesn't mean we should *accept* the ideas, and in
<br>
fact certain ideas should be fought most vigorously - they are not just
<br>
factually wrong but contain seeds which could grow into evil. But any
<br>
act should be counter-acted by a commensurate force, not by escalating
<br>
it arbitrarily. 
<br>
<p>I want to see fundamentalist religions, fascism, technocracy, communism,
<br>
luddism and many other views and their associated ethical systems thrown
<br>
on the scrapheap of history. They are bad for human growth and diversity
<br>
and I think the new enlightenment is far better. But that doesn't mean
<br>
their supporters should be killed or hurt unless they do something first
<br>
to merit it. In any case, killing people is an inefficient way of
<br>
getting rid of ideas, especially the malign kind you describe.
<br>
<p>Tit for tat - start our by offering cooperation, if they defect punish
<br>
back but forgive. And make sure your position is clear and consistent.
