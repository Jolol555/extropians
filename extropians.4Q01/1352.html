<br>
<p>I consider the general engineering problems to be underestimated by you.
<br>
Feel free to prove me wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are correct that reading scanned text or Fax on the screen is slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for some people, 
</em><br>
<p>Nearly everyone who speed-reads, AFAICT. Also, with &quot;landscape&quot; format and 
<br>
current screen sizes, one can't take in an entire page at a glance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and you are correct that the problem is the display,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the scanner. 
</em><br>
<p>The problem is the system. 200 dpi is actually below the measured threshold,
<br>
but the knee starts around there. 300 dpi is adequate, as many laser printer
<br>
sales appear to confirm. Paper carries more information than a scanner can
<br>
transmit. The value of that information is not calculable by Shannon methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the images are static, a display optimized for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution at the expense of frame rate would be ideal. Is anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing this?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Xerox PARC and MIT Media Lab, both already named in this thread.
<br>
For a survey, check out <a href="http://www.sciam.com/2001/1101issue/1101ditlea.html">http://www.sciam.com/2001/1101issue/1101ditlea.html</a>
<br>
from the reviled SciAm. Building a single double-buffered full page (rather than a 
<br>
journal of pages) with either of the technologies mentioned is eminently doable.
<br>
<p>Whether I'll like the result is another matter. But see my old saying above.
