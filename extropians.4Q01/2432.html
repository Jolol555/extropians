&lt;&lt;I could offer suggestions here, but I think I'll stop for the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment. This issue issue makes me exhausted and very upset.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It is emotionally stressful yes. But the world's citizenry, in their zeal to 
<br>
avoid conflicts that are economically, troubling to themselves, seem quite 
<br>
content, to have America sluff-off it's murdered citizens.  In other words, 
<br>
Ameican blood is cheap, compared to, say,  France being able to continue 
<br>
dealing as usual with their business chum in the Islamic world. Business 
<br>
chums who friends and family are terrorists.
<br>
<p>And people wonder why America goes it &quot;alone&quot; on foreign policy? My concern 
<br>
is not that we go it alone, its that our State Department always insists on 
<br>
catering to the needs of the international community, ahead of American 
<br>
citizenry.
<br>
<p>The latest Gallup poll in the USA, shows that support for the 911 War is 
<br>
currently higher then support for American participation in WW2, after Pearl 
<br>
Harbor. Currently, 80% versus 74%.  If the rest of the world wishes us to 
<br>
forget about our dead, please realize that the politicians will have to 
<br>
answer to American voters.
<br>
<p>When the rest of the world starts burying its dead from mass destruction 
<br>
attacks, then we'll see a change of view in those nations.
