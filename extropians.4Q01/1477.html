<p>
I've been seeing a lot of ads for an upcoming movie starring Jet
<br>
Li, called The One, opening November 2.  The look of the movie
<br>
strongly resembles The Matrix, with super-powered, time-altering and
<br>
gravity-defying kung fu fight sequences.  And of course &quot;The One&quot; was
<br>
the name for Neo in The Matrix.  So I would guess that this movie is an
<br>
attempt to capitalize on the success of the earlier film.
<br>
<p>As nearly as I can make out from the web site, sony.com/theone, the sci-fi
<br>
concept is based on multiple universes.  The MultiVerse Authority (MVA)
<br>
is responsible for keeping people from travelling illegally from the
<br>
Alpha universe to one of the parallel universes which have been accessed
<br>
via quantum tunneling.  Jet Li plays Gabriel Yulaw, originally an MVA
<br>
agent now turned criminal.  Yulaw has learned that if someone kills off
<br>
his counterparts in the parallel universes, &quot;Parallel Universe Versions&quot;
<br>
(PUVs), they acquire astounding physical powers.  If they kill off all of
<br>
their PUVs they become immortal and invincible.  Yulaw is now trying to
<br>
kill his last PUV, in the &quot;Magma&quot; universe, which I think is our world.
<br>
He is pursued by MVA agents who are desperate to stop him before he
<br>
acquires ultimate power.
<br>
<p>While it probably won't have the philosophical implications of The Matrix
<br>
it looks like a top notch action film.  The previews have Li dodging
<br>
bullets and knocking them aside with his gun; leaping over tall fences;
<br>
and tossing policemen and vehicles around like toys.  Looks like some
<br>
good escapist entertainment.
<br>
