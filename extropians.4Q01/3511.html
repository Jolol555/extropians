Not so. There is a strong case for saying that it's a lack of realpolitik
<br>
that has led to present problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Realpolitik&quot; is what people call shortsightedness when they wish to think
</em><br>
of themselves as being clever.
<br>
<p>I would argue that it is exactly the opposite - see below.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you give terrorists what they want, you end up with more terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Appeasement.  Danegeld.  Basic rule of supply and demand.
</em><br>
<p>Not always. That depends on what it is the terrorists want. If what they
<br>
want can be conceded without injury to a vital state interest it may well
<br>
pay to do that. I understand, you are saying this will spread the idea that
<br>
you are a patsy and other terrorist groups will spring up. This will happen,
<br>
but not if you make it clear that the reason for the original move was
<br>
calculated self interest.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't calculate for the single, local, present issue, without taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into account the effect on future issues.  &quot;Realpolitik&quot; means not taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into account what happens on the next pass; the effect that your violation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of principle (for realpolitik is never invoked except where principles are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being violated) will have on future dealings with the other nations who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stood by and watched you betray, meddle, appease, or whatever it is you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were doing under the banner of &quot;realpolitik&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Quite the contrary. You are putting up a straw man here. Realpolitik is not
<br>
the absence of principle it *is* a principle, i.e. that governments should
<br>
act so as to protect, preserve and extend the interests of the state rather
<br>
than on the basis of some ideal such as spreading
<br>
socialism/freedom/democracy/the true faith etc etc. Part of this is
<br>
precisely to take a long term view, on the Palmerstonian principle that
<br>
states have no permanent allies or enemies, only permanent interests. It is
<br>
not in the interests of any state to act in a persistently treacherous or
<br>
unreliable way and so this is not part of any policy of realpolitik. If
<br>
states act on the basis of clearly defined and understood interests
<br>
judgement of risks and effects of actions is much easier. Also disputes
<br>
arising out of  conflicts of interest can more often be settled by
<br>
compromise of some kind which is not the case when they are presented as
<br>
being about a clash of principles. (This is undoubtedly one of the problems
<br>
in the middle east). The *real *problems with realpolitik are 1.It conflates
<br>
the interests of populations and ruling elites, 2. it doesn't work so well
<br>
(if at all) in a situation where you don't have Westphalian style states.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The foundation of ethics is the iterated Prisoner's Dilemna, and those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish to try and excuse ethical violations will generally analyze only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single, local round.  They don't argue explicitly that there is just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single round, rather they simply don't analyze anything else in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument.
</em><br>
<p>I quite agree. International relations is a kind of iterated PD and
<br>
realpolitik is (in part) a form of tit-for-tat strategy.
