<p>[... Robert's responses snipped ...]
<br>
<p>My interpretations of your responses lead me to believe that
<br>
you have no reasons to believe that you're not your parents
<br>
biological child, and even if you weren't, it wouldn't matter
<br>
because they raised you as their own child regardless.
<br>
<p>In that same vein, if your girlfriend (or wife, whatever
<br>
the case may be) told you that she was &quot;carrying your child&quot;
<br>
and you had doubts, and you felt you had no reasons to doubt
<br>
her, but later on found out (through testing) that you were
<br>
not the actual biological parent of the child, then what would
<br>
you do?  Would it matter?  Suppose you'd spent the last N years
<br>
raising the child as though he/she were your own.
<br>
<p>You responded to John:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;Human Sexuality&quot; psych course I took circa '89 at the U.W.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had an interesting discussion of a tribe in India where the village
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elders take the adolescents of the tribe, collect them into a &quot;camp&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a few months and have them all sleep with all of the other potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mates in the village.  At the same time they are actually trained to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become good sex partners.  Interestingly enough the village has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenally low divorce rate (&lt; 5%(?)).  I suspect it is because one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learns who the right partner may be for you and the idea that &quot;the grass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be greener elsewhere&quot; may be, to a large degree, purged from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the meme set of individuals having this experience.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting approach to eliminate the jealousy meme, for sure.
<br>
No reason to be jealous of someone if they're sleeping with
<br>
someone because you've slept with everyone they have, too.
<br>
<p>Jealousy definitely appears (feels?) to be something that comes
<br>
about from inclusion/exclusion.
