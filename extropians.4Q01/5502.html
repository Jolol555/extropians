</em><br>
<p>Slashdot is too general, too much signal (and corresponding noise,
<br>
obviously).  An extrodot would have a more specific focus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or what <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/">http://www.kurzweilai.net/</a> does?
</em><br>
<p>It's not obvious as to what's new, or how to contribute.
<br>
It takes considerable effort to go through the various
<br>
categories to check what new material is available, and
<br>
the only place where it's obvious you can contribute (in
<br>
response to a posted article) is done horribly.  Threaded
<br>
and in last-in-last-out (sorted by datestamp in ascending
<br>
order, newest at the bottom) -- yikes.
<br>
<p>Additionally, the annoying pop-up and excessive use of gratuitous
<br>
Flash are so intrusive that they detract from the site's appeal,
<br>
at least to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How are you going to get people to contribute magnet content, to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people to contribute, making it a sustainable process?
</em><br>
<p>Fame and glory.  Chicks and beer.  Brute force and ignorance.
<br>
<p>Beats me.  If people don't contribute, well, they won't.  If
<br>
they'll contribute content at all, then we can just scrape it
<br>
from wherever it's being contributed until people contribute
<br>
directly.  If nobody's contributing fresh content ANYWHERE,
<br>
then no approach is going to work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We've tried this, and it just fizzled.
</em><br>
<p>Lets try to self-improve and learn from our mistakes.  What
<br>
do you feel were contributing factors to the failure of the
<br>
attempt?  What do you think could be done differently that
<br>
would increase our chances of success?
