<em>&gt; This is a fundamental question for me -- on the one hand I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly like the information to be available to overthrow an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppressive government dedicated to limiting my freedoms.  At the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time I am reluctant to adapt a position that makes such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information available to people (essentially &quot;other tribes&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would like to use it not only to destroy my security shield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but *my* way of thinking entirely (be it *either* a U.S. self-preservation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or an extropic maximization of information content perspective).
</em><br>
<p>This problem worries me concerning the New Colony Project. Ideally, the colony would only have itself to worry about, without caring
<br>
about the existance of other peoples.
<br>
<p>However, short of nuclear warfare on Earth, a nanotech accident or any other globally fatal disaster on Earth (*after* the colony
<br>
had established its independence while assuming no other significent, attack capable colonies exist), we must take into account
<br>
people who would want to free-ride on our information.
<br>
<p><p>We could see why utopia designers always prefer isolated utopias - we can work out their social systems more easily. Isolationism
<br>
would not work, because:
<br>
<p>1) The benefits from trade, especially when the colony starts operation, would prove overwhelming. Information trade, and trading
<br>
materials abundant in space with the abundant on Earth would turn great dividents indeed.
<br>
<p>2) Spies could still work their way in, with some Earth societies justifying it as National Security or self-defence issue (for what
<br>
would you think of a nuclear, biological or even only nano-capable independent society you know little about)
<br>
<p><p>Some of you might like to give our ideas away, but bear in mind that:
<br>
<p>1) Other societies might not recipocate. This means they might have the *cheek* to demand we pay them Intellectual Property and
<br>
patent fees while they download our research information freely.
<br>
<p>2) Even if other societies do recipocate, they might and might not censor the information they share with us. If they do censor, we
<br>
might find ourselves at the losing end, since they would know if we try to censor but we won't neccessarily know about their
<br>
attempts.
<br>
<p>3) We can use information as a bargaining chip. For instance, in return for some designs for using nanotech to produce nutritious
<br>
food for the masses, you can pursuade some nations to avoid pointing nuclear missiles or satellite weapons at you.
<br>
<p>4) Different information has different value. We often hear of the common argument that an open information system will also reveal
<br>
the vulnerabilities of a system and one can fix it. However, what if:
<br>
<p>a. the vulnerabilities take too long to fix compared to attacking them
<br>
b. the vulnerabilities take too much expense to fix in the short term future when one has insufficient resources (as when starting
<br>
up a colony)
<br>
c. the vulnerabilities concern one's safety and existance so much that any  attack would have such devasting effect that one cannot
<br>
even afford a remote chance of exploitation
<br>
<p><p>5) You have no guarantee of rational behavior from other colonies, even if your colony operates rationally. Some may perceive your
<br>
neutral accidental act of trangression of their boundaries as an agressive action. Some may have an irrational ideological dislike
<br>
of your colony, and want to destory it. As with irrational action, as we cannot predict it, anything can happen. Telling them about
<br>
ourselves may only provide them with a better way to attack us.
<br>
<p><p>I, personally, would prefer a society with an open information flow than a censored one. However, until we can find out how to
<br>
resolve such troublesome issues, we might still need some censorship or having to refrain from construction of a large scale colony.
<br>
<p><p>---------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, here is the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should access to information be based on accreditation?
</em><br>
<p>I understand that accreditation means, according to my dictionary, the act of certifying that an educational institution maintains
<br>
suitable standards (but applied to human beings instead). I hereby propose an alternative and also take the chance to eloborate on
<br>
some ideas I have.
<br>
<p><p>I suggest that each society divide its people into at least two people, Aspiring Appendices (AA) and Mentally Mature (MM). An
<br>
extract from the New Colony Project paper follows (with slight corrections and eloboration):
<br>
<p>Dual System of Laws (of Maturity)
<br>
This society would deploy a dual-system of laws, one to enable capable individuals to act freely, and the second will protect less
<br>
experienced individuals (as known in lay people's term as children) from potentially harmful stimuli that they cannot handle due to
<br>
lack of experience.
<br>
<p><p>The former we shall call &quot;Mentally Mature&quot; (MM) and the latter &quot;Aspiring Apprentices&quot; (AA). This partially corresponds to what we
<br>
call the &quot;Age of Majority&quot; in &quot;Common Law&quot;, but without any arbitrary age.
<br>
<p>This allows people to gain the ability to take control their lives at their own pace. Unlike the &quot;Age of Majority&quot; concept, it does
<br>
not unnecessary force or remove responsibility from individuals. Unlike blanket proposals such as declaring unlimited freedom of
<br>
information or declaring censorship on all people of all undesirable information, it does not cause distress to those unprepared to
<br>
gain such information nor dissatisfaction to those who wish such a freedom.
<br>
<p><p>By default, newcomers to the colony (such as by birth or emigration) will attain the status of AA unless they declare otherwise.
<br>
When an AA declares MM status, he or she must publish in the announcement area of a public forum such a declaration, and henceforth
<br>
will receive a certain trial period of a certain time that will allow him or her to retract the declaration.
<br>
<p>Both MM and AA enjoys advantages (and corresponding disadvantages) in accordance to their status.
<br>
<p>Rights &amp; Limitations of &quot;Aspiring Apprentices&quot;
<br>
.	Prohibition from Free Discussion of &quot;Dirty&quot; Politics, Violence &amp; Pornography
<br>
<p><p>Rights &amp; Limitations of &quot;Mentally Mature&quot;
<br>
.	Prohibition from doing anything of great future consequences with AA
<br>
<p><p>We can rightfully understand that some AAs would, through their ignorance, wants to preview an MM lifestyle. We should prepare a
<br>
catalog of less controversial topics with analysis that we can show AAs for them to judge.
