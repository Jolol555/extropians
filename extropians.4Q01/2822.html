<br>
The question presupposes that cultural engineering is *possible*. With
<br>
all due respect, I don't believe it is -- at least, not in this context.
<br>
The west has _not_ conquered and occupied Afghanistan. All that's happend
<br>
is that the Taliban's morale has broken and their old rivals have scored
<br>
some victories in the civil war that's been raging for about fifteen
<br>
years. The cities are honey-traps; they don't actually have a significant
<br>
industrial base, and actually nailing the Taliban will require occupying
<br>
the country and cutting off their recruiting base.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean the Taliban can win, any more than the Khmer Rouge
<br>
could in 1978 (after Vietnam responded to their cross-border terrorist
<br>
activities by invading). But it doesn't make them a non-factor, either.
<br>
Look at how thoroughly the Khmer Rouge screwed Cambodia over the next
<br>
couple of decades for an example of what _could_ happen if we break out
<br>
the champagne prematurely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should we be satisfied merely with a government that no longer gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe harbor to Al Quaida? Or should we strive for more, like respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for free speech, privacy, elected and accountable government, equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection under the law (in particular, equal rights for women)?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Afghanistan isn't a country with a distinct national and cultural
<br>
identity; the nearest analogy I can come up with is Yugoslavia. It has
<br>
traditionally been a crossroads between Empires, and has a population
<br>
of tribal groups who in many cases don't even speak the same language
<br>
and who hate each other virulently.
<br>
<p>Into this mix, add religious beliefs of a remarkably fanatical variety,
<br>
shored up by the religious schools in Pakistan who are bankrolled by
<br>
rich Arabian Wahabbites. Then add an illiteracy rate of 70% among 
<br>
men, rising to 90% among women. 
<br>
<p>You can't educate people who can't read and don't speak your language.
<br>
<p>I therefore conclude that if our governments decided to opt for social 
<br>
engineering, and reform, it'll take two whole generations to re-program
<br>
enough of the population to ensure stability and liberalism. Two generations,
<br>
moreover, without a running guerilla war or the jackboot of foreign infidel
<br>
oppression for the mullahs to rail against.
<br>
<p>Given that the political horizon in the west is about two years away, I
<br>
don't hold out much hope of this happening. It's far too much of a long-
<br>
term committment for a democracy to undertake. Now, the Soviet government
<br>
could conceive of such projects, but they weren't hampered by the short-
<br>
termism of western politicians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we opt for the latter, are we being cultural imperialists, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is blatantly not consistant with their way of life, particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last item? In such cases, is it necessarily wrong to be a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialist?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Stop brow-beating yourself and start worrying about the effect dealing
<br>
with barbarians is going to have on _our_ core values. Speaking as a
<br>
hard- core liberal, I'm more worried about detention without judicial
<br>
review and military tribunals getting a toe-hold in the west than I am
<br>
about western values teaching the poor tribesmen how to read and write.
