<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do not oppose the elimination of corporate ownership of IP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Corporations are not senient beings, and therefore cannot be artists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Constitution clearly states that Congress is to protect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creators, the artists, not anyone else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think as Extropians we would support the notion that collective and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-human entities should have rights if they are able to request them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We envision a time when social and mental structures will be much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex than the simple distinction we have today between individuals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations.  We could have hybrid beings with some of the properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If two or more people want to hook up their brains and think collectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it should be OK.  If someone wants to subdivide their consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into multiple semi-autonomous parts, that should be permitted as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should encourage experimentation like this.  It will add diversity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the world and make more opportunities available to everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are not able today to make biological changes, but we can support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the existing mechanisms which allow for quasi- and virtual-persons to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist under the law.  Corporations, partnerships, marriages and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groupings should be allowed to be treated as individuals when they choose,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the maximum degree practical.
</em><br>
<p>In one word, NO. Corporations do not create anything through their own
<br>
imagination. The individuals do so to greater and lesser degrees. The
<br>
janitor doesn't create a building or machine design, doesn't design a
<br>
logo or ad campaign. The secretary doesn't create a business plan or
<br>
program an application. It is individual human beings who create.
<br>
<p>In a family, the preexisting children, the in-laws, etc do not
<br>
contribute one whit to the actual creation of a baby. That is the job of
<br>
the husband and wife. They are the ones who are the artists, the
<br>
creators, and therefore they are the ones with the rights in respect to
<br>
their creation.
<br>
<p>Any creation of art should be credited to those individuals who created
<br>
it, in proportion to the degree of their original creative contribution
<br>
to the final result, and any financial gain from the sale of said art
<br>
should be in proportion to their respective degree of contribution.
