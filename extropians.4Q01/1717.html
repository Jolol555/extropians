<em>&gt; |[...]  A lot of people who attack what they call &quot;capitalists&quot;, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |example, just assume that capitalists would favor right-to-work laws, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |example, that libertarians in fact oppose.  They assume that trade unions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |are anti-capitalist, when in fact they are a fine capitalist concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |Most assume that capitalists support intellectual property, when that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |issue is orthogonal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |Once we agree on what we're talking about, productive discussion might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |become possible (assuming those doing the discussing are themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |capable of rational thought).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest you summarize the libertarian definition of &quot;capitalism&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After Mr. Bokov summarizes his definition we can start discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant matters instead debating the meaning of words.
</em><br>
<p>Here's what _I_ mean by the word &quot;capitalism&quot;, which is also my
<br>
impression of what most libertarians mean as well:
<br>
<p>A capitalist system is one in which:
<br>
<p>- The courts protect the private property rights of every
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;individual without bias or prejudice.  Access to the court
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;system is universal, and relatively cheap.  Access to a police
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;force to back up court decrees is universal and cheap.
<br>
- The courts likewise enforce the terms of all freely-entered
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts between private parties, without bias or prejudice,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not arbitrarily overrule contract terms that are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;against public policy&quot; as our courts do now.
<br>
- The courts prosecute private torts, awarding damages to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wronged parties fairly in proprtion to damage done.  Pollution
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a private tort.
<br>
- The government does not have the power of eminent domain to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;steal people's land and give it to developers.  Nor does it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have the power to arbitrarily restrict the way a land owner
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;can use his land with zoning laws.
<br>
- The government does not subsidize any industry, provide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;price supports, or tax relief to some industries and not others.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, it doesn't tax some industries more than others for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public policy reasons, or tax businesses or individuals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;excessively.
<br>
- The government does not impose import/export tariffs.
<br>
- The government does not legislate in favor of business or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in favor of labor, but stays out of all disputes, other than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to enforce the terms of freely-entered contracts and to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;punish torts.  It provides no special protection for trade
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unions, nor protects any business from strikes or from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;closed shop&quot; contracts.
<br>
- The government does not regulate prices, wages, production,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution, or any other method of business.  Things like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;workplace safety, sexual harassment, false advertising, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other practices are handled as private torts.
<br>
- The government does not regulate or restrict gambling,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;prostitution, usury, or the drug trade (except perhaps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;where children are involved).
<br>
- The government does not grant or enforce monopolies for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public utilities, public services (like mail), public
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;roads, or anything else than can be handled by the free
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;market (whether or not public defense can be privatized
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is an open issue).
<br>
- The government does not redistribute wealth in the form of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;welfare programs; nor does it interfere with private
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;efforts to do so (as our government does).
<br>
- Education is private, not mandatory, and unregulated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(except with regard to child safety).
<br>
<p>Intellectual property is a contentious issue.  I happen to
<br>
believe it is an anti-capitalist idea, being a government-
<br>
granted monopoly.  Many others disagree, thinking it is a
<br>
natural extension of tangible property.
