In the ongoing discussion initiated by Greg,
<br>
<p>Barbara Lamar (<a href="mailto:altamira@texas.net?Subject=RE:%20Energy%20and%20&quot;the%20Clash%20of%20Civilizations&quot;%20ERRATA&In-Reply-To=&lt;20011001053110.63864.qmail@web13504.mail.yahoo.com&gt;">altamira@texas.net</a>)

Date: Sat Sep 29 2001 - 11:35:49 MDT, 
<br>
one of my favorite people, wrote: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (oil use by sector is, from highest to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lowest--industrial, transportation, commercial,    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; residential).
</em><br>
<p>I wondered about this, because I had just been
<br>
googling around looking for data on oil consumption,
<br>
and seemed to recall reading that transportion was at
<br>
the top of the list in the area of oil consumption.
<br>
<p>So I searched around, and think I have cleared up the
<br>
conflict. 
<br>
<p>At <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/ep.pdf">http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/ep.pdf</a> 
<br>
<p>you will find the Energy Information Administration/ 
<br>
Annual Energy Review 2000  
<br>
<p>&quot;Figure 7.  Energy consumption by end-use&quot;, which I
<br>
can't show because it's a graphic, is captioned as
<br>
follows:
<br>
<p>The industrial sector of the economy used the largest
<br>
share of energy and showed the greatest volatility. In
<br>
particular, steep drops occurred in 1975 and 1980-83
<br>
in response to high oil prices. Transportation was the
<br>
next largest energy consuming sector, followed by
<br>
residential use and commercial use.
<br>
<p>Seeming to confirm Barbara's report. 
<br>
<p>However, further along one finds  &quot;Figure 18.
<br>
Petroleum Consumption by Sector&quot;.  
<br>
<p>Its caption says:
<br>
<p>Transportation was the largest consuming sector of
<br>
petroleum and the one showing the greatest expansion
<br>
over the second half of the 20th century.  In 2000, 13
<br>
million barrels per day of petroleum products were
<br>
consumed for transportation purposes, accounting for
<br>
67 percent of all petroleum used.
<br>
<p>I feel so much better now that that's cleared up.
<br>
<p>Rock on, Barbara.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
