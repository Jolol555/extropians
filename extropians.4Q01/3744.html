<p>PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
<br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
<br>
Number 567  November 29, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben
<br>
Stein, and James Riordon
<br>
<p>ATTOSECOND PHYSICS HAS ARRIVED. An Austria-
<br>
Canada-Germany collaboration (Ferenc Krausz, Vienna Institute
<br>
of Technology, <a href="mailto:ferenc.krausz@tuwien.ac.at?Subject=Re:%20Attotechnology&In-Reply-To=&lt;015601c17c46$2d6c1ee0$0a0b5e0c@flrjs&gt;">ferenc.krausz@tuwien.ac.at</a>) reports that it has
<br>
produced and  detected, for the first time, isolated x-ray pulses lasting
<br>
on the scale of attoseconds, where one attosecond is a billionth of a
<br>
billionth of a second (10^-18 s). The reported pulses, lasting
<br>
approximately 650 attoseconds (as) and residing in the soft x-ray
<br>
part of the electromagnetic spectrum, subsequently provided
<br>
attosecond-scale measurements of a physical phenomenon
<br>
(specifically, the detachment of an electron from an atom by an
<br>
x-ray photon).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these observations, and several earlier ones by other
<br>
groups, attophysics becomes the short-timescale frontier of
<br>
physics. It replaces femtochemistry, the production of light
<br>
pulses at the 10^-15 s (femtosecond) scale, in this regard. Just as
<br>
a strobelight can yield stop-action photographs of a falling water
<br>
drop, femtosecond pulses can capture the ultrafast steps of a
<br>
chemical reaction between multiple atoms or molecules. But
<br>
attosecond pulses are better equipped to capture the even speedier
<br>
motions of electrons within atoms.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If light can be imagined as a wave of peaks and valleys, a one-
<br>
second visible light pulse is a train of roughly 600 trillion
<br>
(6*10^14) peaks and valleys in length. The researchers report an
<br>
attosecond pulse just 200 nanometers long, carrying just over a
<br>
dozen peaks and valleys. Therefore, the duration of a light pulse
<br>
can be thought of as the length along its direction of travel. A
<br>
1.28-second pulse can stretch from an Earthbound laboratory to
<br>
the moon; a 650-attosecond pulse would barely span the length of
<br>
two typical viruses.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous experiments have reported evidence of trains of
<br>
attosecond pulses following each other roughly every 1 fs
<br>
(Papadogiannis et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 22 November1999; Paul et
<br>
al., Science, 1 June 2001; Bartels et al., Nature, 13 July 2000),
<br>
but the new experiment, according to the researchers, represents
<br>
the first detection and measurement of isolated attosecond pulses.
<br>
Such isolated pulses, Krausz states, are important for taking
<br>
attosecond-resolution snapshots of electron motion in atoms.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accomplish their feat, the researchers first prepared an
<br>
intense fsec pulse and aimed it at neon gas. The interaction
<br>
between the neon gas and the fsec pulse created an attosecond-
<br>
scale pulse in the soft x-ray range. According to a helpful
<br>
theoretical picture (Corkum, Physical Review Letters, 27
<br>
September 1993), the fsec pulse ejects electrons from neon
<br>
atoms, and the resulting oscillations of the electrons in the bath of
<br>
fsec light produce an even shorter-duration soft-x-ray pulse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producing attosecond light is only half the battle. The
<br>
researchers then had to measure its duration. By adjusting the
<br>
delay between the times at which the x-ray pulse and a fsec
<br>
visible pulse hit a gas of krypton atoms, the researchers affected
<br>
the spectrum of energies in the electrons liberated from the
<br>
atoms. Such modulations in the observed energy spread served as
<br>
evidence for an x-ray pulse of 650 attoseconds.  Henry Kapteyn
<br>
of JILA/University of Colorado (303-492-819,
<br>
<a href="mailto:kapteyn@jila.colorado.edu?Subject=Re:%20Attotechnology&In-Reply-To=&lt;015601c17c46$2d6c1ee0$0a0b5e0c@flrjs&gt;">kapteyn@jila.colorado.edu</a>), a member of a competing group,
<br>
claims that the evidence is ambiguous as to whether the
<br>
collaboration detected isolated attosecond pulses or trains of
<br>
attosecond pulses.  Both Kapteyn and Krausz have respected
<br>
colleagues who back their differing views.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However this debate pans out, attosecond metrology has arrived,
<br>
and it will doubtlessly lead to some staggering physics
<br>
experiments never before possible. (Hentschel et al., Nature, 29
<br>
