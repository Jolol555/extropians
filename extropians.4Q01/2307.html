<em>&gt; &gt; What should the extropian definition of freedom be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Same as the dictionary definition, because supplying yet another definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would dilute the meaning, thereby causing linguistic entropy rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropy.
</em><br>
<p>A nice rejoinder, but I am not proposing that we redefine 'freedom' to
<br>
mean 'small lacquered wooden pieces' or anything outside its normal
<br>
meaning. What I was thinking of was a more careful definition of the
<br>
term in accordance with the extropian perspective.
<br>
<p>A quick look on the web in Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary gave
<br>
&quot;the quality or state of being free: as a : the absence of necessity,
<br>
coercion, or constraint in choice or action b : liberation from slavery
<br>
or restraint or from the power of another&quot; as well as some other
<br>
meanings we need not concern ourselves with right now. While this is a
<br>
good definition, it can be interpreted very differently. In a Marxist
<br>
perspective the &quot;power of another&quot; part would imply that freedom can
<br>
*only* occur in the true communist society, and is necessarily
<br>
impossible before that. And the &quot;absence of necessity&quot; would void the
<br>
concept to someone believing physical laws to be deterministic.
<br>
<p>The extropian perspective is different in that it questions traditional
<br>
ideas of human nature and identity. We can envision many apparently
<br>
physically possible and perhaps future scenarios were traditional
<br>
boundaries are transcended. For that we need to think about what we
<br>
mean by freedom, since when we enter the mainstream debate many of the
<br>
traditional concepts of freedom are often used against us, or rather
<br>
the very flexible use of the term 'coercion'. Are we coercing others
<br>
into a transhuman lifestyle by attempting to achieve it for ourselves
<br>
(since the economic competition becomes stronger)? I would say no, but
<br>
a surprising number of people think so, and hence they think we are
<br>
anti-freedom. It might sound like a silly argument, but when many
<br>
people view it as acceptable it is not silly anymore, it is dangerous.
