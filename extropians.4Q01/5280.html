<p>It's only unproductive if you are unwilling to accept the figures. No
<br>
amount of persuation works on those unwilling to be persuaded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Let's go back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the original issues in the thread:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I am saying is that there needs to be a filtration system put in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; place between high trust and low trust societies. Failing to do so will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only result, as we have seen, in a social equivalent of the old 'bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; money pushes out good money' phenomenon. Allowing unrestricted access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals from low trust societies only results in your high trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society becoming diluted into a low trust society, at a rate relative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the rate of immigration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No-one has 'unrestricted access' to US society; the INS already has a pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggressive policy towards non-residents, as I myself found out when working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US. I suggest that any problem of access should be dealt with by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refining the access (i.e. Visa-granting) procedures; not by suggesting that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone who is not a US citizen should be judged guilty of a crime until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven innocent. The cornerstone of US society appears (to an outsider) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the way in which all people living in the US are treated equally. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throw this away is surely both unwarranted and dangerous?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, however, the 'innocent until proven guilty' only applies maximally,
<br>
generally, to those who willingly accept the jurisdiction of the state
<br>
and participate voluntarily in the justice system. When one becomes a
<br>
fugitive, a suspect is far less likely to be granted bail, etc. as a
<br>
non-fugitive would be. Similarly, a person who has violated INS rules
<br>
and moves to an unreported location when their visa expires makes
<br>
themselves a fugitive, and because of this, are not entitled to the same
<br>
sort of trust and respect of 'personal recognizance' that a voluntary
<br>
participant in the legal process would enjoy.
<br>
<p>Detaining those who have violated the terms of their visa are justly
<br>
being detained because they are, at the very least, flight risks, even
<br>
if they are not participants in an actual terrorist plot.
<br>
<p>The claim that they are being denied access to lawyers is not true. Some
<br>
refuse to accept court appointed lawyers but do not have the means to
<br>
hire lawyers of their own.
<br>
<p>Nor does being held for military tribunals strip one of a right to a
<br>
lawyer. Because, though, it is a military court, the lawyers are all
<br>
members of the JAG corps (i.e. US military officers), which I would
<br>
expect some foreigners would be hesitant to accept as defense counsel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We know that al Qaeda was based in the Sudan with the support of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sudanese government, and from there, they recruited and sent terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the US to bomb the WTC in 1993. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as far as your argument was phrased, you were not suggesting that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; INS treat applicants from (eg) the Sudan) with additional suspicion. Rather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were suggesting that all immigrants from the Sudan be treated as guilty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any crime until proven innocent, and treated differently to any other US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen.
</em><br>
<p>My statement about 'guilty until proven innocent' was not necessarily in
<br>
regards to an actual courtroom, more a matter of filtration procedures
<br>
by the INS. Immigration laws, as originally structured, have always been
<br>
on a 'guilty until proven innocent' basis, because a nation could never
<br>
tell who was and was not an enemy agent. Trust was given, though, that a
<br>
person who denounced their home country and pledged allegiance to the US
<br>
was making an honest and forthright declaration. The problem with this
<br>
trust is that, in the case of muslims, the Qur'an literally states that
<br>
a believer is not responsible to fulfill any promises made to infidels,
<br>
ergo such declarations are on their face worthless, and anyone
<br>
professing to be a muslim must be assumed to not regard infidels as
<br>
worth respecting promises to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Al Qaeda itself was the security arm of the Taliban government. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rock have you been hiding under?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I don't understand your position. Are you suggesting that all Afghan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refugees fleeing from such a regime should be treated as terrorists? We can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surely make a distinction between bona fide refugees from a regime of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terror, and the terrorists (and their supporters) who are running the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country?
</em><br>
<p>Can you? How exactly do you make such a distinction? How do you verify
<br>
that refugee A is or is not a past member of the Taliban? One should
<br>
assume from now on that anyone who claims refugee status here from the
<br>
present Afghan government MUST be a Taliban, since such are the only
<br>
enemies of the present government. Furthermore, all past Afghan refugees
<br>
who are not making plans to return to Afghanistan sometime in the next
<br>
year or so should similarly be viewed with caution as a possible
<br>
infiltrator.
