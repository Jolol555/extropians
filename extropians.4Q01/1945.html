FBI Eyes Torture
<br>
October 29, 2001
<br>
by Alexander Cockburn
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://freedomofpress.tripod.com/cockburn1.html">http://freedomofpress.tripod.com/cockburn1.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;FBI and Justice Department investigators are increasingly frustrated by the
<br>
silence of jailed suspected associates of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda
<br>
network, and some are beginning to that say that traditional civil liberties
<br>
may have to be cast aside if they are to extract information about the Sept.
<br>
11 attacks and terrorist plans.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thus began a piece by Walter Pincus on page 6 of The Washington Post on
<br>
Sunday, and if you suspect that this is the overture to an argument for
<br>
torture, you are right. The FBI interrogators have been getting nowhere with
<br>
the four key suspects, held in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center.
<br>
None of these men have talked, and Pincus quotes an FBI man involved in the
<br>
interrogation as saying that &quot;it could get to that spot where we could go to
<br>
pressure...where we won't have a choice, and we are probably getting there.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pincus reports that &quot;among the alternative strategies under discussion are
<br>
using drugs or pressure tactics, such as those employed occasionally by
<br>
Israeli interrogators, to extract information. Another idea is extraditing
<br>
the suspects to allied countries where security services sometimes employ
<br>
threats to family members or resort to torture.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some FBI interrogators are thinking longingly of drugs like the so-called
<br>
&quot;truth serum,&quot; sodium pentothal; others the &quot;pressure tactics,&quot; i.e.,
<br>
straightforward tortures, used by Shin Bet in Israel, banned after savage
<br>
public debate a few years ago, which included sensory deprivation (an old
<br>
favorite of British interrogators in Northern Ireland), plus many agonizing
<br>
physical torments. Another idea is to send the suspects to other countries
<br>
for torture by seasoned experts. Israel is not mentioned; nor are the
<br>
British. Extradition of Moussaoui to France or Morocco is apparently a
<br>
possibility.
<br>
<p>CounterPunch was astounded to find David Cole, noted liberal professor at
<br>
Georgetown University Law Center, being quoted by Pincus as saying that &quot;the
<br>
use of force to extract information could happen&quot; in cases where
<br>
investigators believe suspects have information on an upcoming attack. &quot;If
<br>
there is a ticking bomb, it is not an easy issue, it's tough,&quot; he said. Of
<br>
course it's tough. As Cole surely knows, the &quot;ticking bomb&quot; rationale has
<br>
been used by Israel's torture lobby for years, long after it had become
<br>
clear that it had simply become a routine way of dealing with suspects.
<br>
Right now the disposition of the FBI, intent on interrogating every Arab
<br>
American male (some 200,000) in this country, is doubtless to assume that
<br>
they might have knowledge of a ticking bomb.
<br>
<p>The FBI claims it is hampered by its present codes of gentility. If so,
<br>
there's no need to eye Morocco or France as subcontracting torturers. As a
<br>
practical matter torture is far from unknown in the interrogation rooms of
<br>
U.S. law enforcement, with Abner Louima the best-known recent example.
<br>
<p>The most infamous disclosure of consistent torture by a police department in
<br>
recent years concerned cops in Chicago in the mid-70s through early 80s who
<br>
used electroshock, oxygen deprivation, hanging on hooks, the bastinado and
<br>
beatings of the testicles. The torturers were white and their victims black
<br>
or brown. A prisoner in California's Pelican Bay State Prison was thrown
<br>
into boiling water. Others get 50,000-volt shocks from stun guns. Many
<br>
states have so-called &quot;secure housing units&quot; where prisoners are kept in
<br>
solitary in tiny concrete cells for years on end, many of them going mad in
<br>
the process. Amnesty International has denounced U.S. police forces for &quot;a
<br>
pattern of unchecked excessive force amounting to torture.&quot;
<br>
<p>Last year the UN delivered a severe public rebuke to the United States for
<br>
its record on preventing torture and degrading punishment. A 10-strong panel
<br>
of experts highlighted what it said were Washington's breaches of the
<br>
agreement ratified by the United States in 1994. The UN Committee Against
<br>
Torture, which monitors international compliance with the UN Convention
<br>
Against Torture, has called for the abolition of electric-shock stun belts
<br>
(1000 in use in the U.S.) and restraint chairs on prisoners, as well as an
<br>
end to holding children in adult jails. It also said female detainees are
<br>
&quot;very often held in humiliating and degrading circumstances&quot; and expressed
<br>
concern over alleged cases of sexual assault by police and prison officers.
<br>
The panel criticized the excessively harsh regime in maximum security
<br>
prisons, the use of chain gangs in which prisoners perform manual labor
<br>
while shackled together, and the number of cases of police brutality against
<br>
racial minorities.
<br>
<p>So far as rape is concerned, because of the rape factories more
<br>
conventionally known as the U.S. prison system, there are estimates that
<br>
twice as many men as women are raped in the U.S. each year. A Human Rights
<br>
Watch report in April of this year cited a December 2000 Prison Journal
<br>
study based on a survey of inmates in seven men's prison facilities in four
<br>
states. The results showed that 21 percent of the inmates had experienced at
<br>
least one episode of pressured or forced sexual contact since being
<br>
incarcerated, and at least 7 percent had been raped in their facilities. A
<br>
1996 study of the Nebraska prison system produced similar findings, with 22
<br>
percent of male inmates reporting that they had been pressured or forced to
<br>
have sexual contact against their will while incarcerated. Of these, more
<br>
than 50 percent had submitted to forced anal sex at least once.
<br>
Extrapolating these findings to the national level gives a total of at least
<br>
140,000 inmates who have been raped.
<br>
<p>Since its inception the CIA has taken a keen interest in torture, avidly
<br>
studying Nazi techniques and protecting their exponents such as Klaus
<br>
Barbie. The FBI could ship the four key suspects to plenty of countries
<br>
taught torture by CIA technicians, including El Salvador. Robert Fisk
<br>
reported in the London Independent in 1998 that after the 1979 revolution
<br>
Iranians found a CIA film made for the SAVAK, the Shah's political police,
<br>
on how to torture women. William Blum, whose Rogue State (Common Courage,
<br>
2000) gives a useful overview of the United States' relationship to torture,
<br>
cites a 1970 story in Brazil's extremely respectable Jornal do Brasil,
<br>
quoting the former Urugayan chief of police intelligence, Alejandro Otero,
<br>
as saying that U.S. advisers, particularly Dan Mitrione, had instituted
<br>
torture in Uruguay on a routine basis, with scientific refinement in
<br>
technique (such as the precise upper limits of electric voltage before death
<br>
intervened) and psychological pressure, such as a tape in the next room of
<br>
women and children screaming, telling the prisoner that his family was being
<br>
tortured.
<br>
<p>The CIA's official line is that torture is wrong and is ineffective. It is
<br>
indeed wrong. On countless occasions it has been appallingly effective.
