<p>This strikes me as a bad and deep misunderstanding of what rationality is.
<br>
Of *course* a rational darwinian explanation can totally account for
<br>
*anything* that's evolved. Does it thereby `support' it? In what sense
<br>
`support'? Does a rational account `support' the somewhat arbitrary colors
<br>
of one's inner organs? Not in the sense that we could predict the
<br>
equivalent hues inside an alien, but well, sure, sort of, except that word
<br>
is being forced to apply outside its environment of evolutionary
<br>
adaptedness. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is not uncommon here for people to make really strong

</em><br>
<p>I have the feeling that `spirituality'--as samantha is here deploying the
<br>
word--primarily denotes and connotes certain states of consciousness and
<br>
volition somewhat orthogonal to the frame of mind one enters when counting
<br>
the number of cows in the paddock, making sure not to get gored or to step
<br>
in cow shit, jotting down the numbers on a piece of paper, muttering
<br>
through some add-ups to see how many will need to be sold at market and how
<br>
much the feed will cost and what the weather looks like right now... by
<br>
which, I hope it's obvious, I mean to convey an image of *practical
<br>
reasoning*, functioning in the world. 
<br>
<p>Is doing higher-dimensional mathematics or writing a novel like this? To
<br>
some extent, although in those jobs one does tend to leave a fair bit of
<br>
the work to sub-processes or modules that are usually inaccessible to
<br>
scrutiny, the operation of which can occur with a sense of effort (or, if
<br>
you're lucky, bliss) but yields up its results as a flash of
<br>
`illumination', even a continuous stream of them. 
<br>
<p>At this point I think we have reached functions that folk psychology might
<br>
dub `spiritual', because it long ago mistakenly theorized that such states
<br>
were a kind of `communication with the ineffable', or even with a `god'. If
<br>
all this, however crudely put, is so, then obviously anyone of any subtlety
<br>
will be well acquainted with the spiritual--but the more earth-bound and
<br>
`practical' and `no bullshit' one is forced to be, the less access one can
<br>
have to those processes. One might end up as Babbitt.
<br>
<p>Spirituality without spirits, that's the way to go; consequently, as Emlyn
<br>
notes, it'd be useful to have a new or at least less
<br>
metaphysically-encrusted term than `spirituality'.
