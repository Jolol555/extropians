<em>&gt; Yeah, I'm mostly a software guy. I've been developing products for 30

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Let's constrain the problem a bit further to include only mail no thicker
<br>
than 1/4 inch and no larger than an Overnight Letter envelope. How do you 
<br>
handle those big stiff cardboard envelopes? If the system is truly centralized, 
<br>
how do you handle floppy FedEx Tyvek envelopes? How do you clear jams?
<br>
<p>I've slept on this--the handling systems the USPS uses to direct mail could
<br>
be a starting point, but they're still based on the assumption of benignity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;You are correct that reading scanned text or Fax on the screen is slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;for some people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nearly everyone who speed-reads, AFAICT. Also, with &quot;landscape&quot; format and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; current screen sizes, one can't take in an entire page at a glance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For those of you who can really benefit for it, print the file to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-quality printer and read it that way. 
</em><br>
<p>Whenever I have to proofread, say, that's exactly what I do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Paper carries more information than a scanner can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transmit. The value of that information is not calculable by Shannon methods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  From this I infer that you don't read stuff that was generated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer and then printed? Such a paper copy cannot have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information than was already in the computer in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>Nope and nope.
<br>
<p>Too large a leap, here. :) Ask any archivist at the Bodelian Library what I meant. :)
<br>
<p>Even speaking of things I print myself which have never hit paper before, sometimes
<br>
I print on cream-colored laid paper, sometimes I print on textured granite gray.
<br>
It makes it easy to sort papers with visual and tactile cues. I know that any piece
<br>
of paper that's plain white wasn't something I printed.
<br>
<p>But I was talking about the original paper. Some correspondents spend a lot of time 
<br>
designing their (paper, etc.) look &amp; feel. This goes away. You can't tell if they used
<br>
kaolin clay impregnated paper, or expensive inks, or gold leaf, or whatever.
<br>
<p>The system-as-medium is still lossy, and that's what I was pointing out. 
<br>
<p>Cheerio,
<br>
<p>MMB
