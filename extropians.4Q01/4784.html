</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, who exactly is &quot;they&quot;? Don't we first have to find out, before we can

</em><br>
<p>Well, we know who &quot;They&quot; is, as a group. We need to determine who they,
<br>
as individuals are, who have infiltrated us and are still around. You
<br>
can't do it by ESP. Detaining and questioning suspects is the only way.
<br>
You apparently know nothing about police work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about this Oklahoma lunatic, for example. Who was &quot;they&quot; in that case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every white person? Every white christian person? Every person of his home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; town or state?
</em><br>
<p>Did we detain every muslim or arab in the US? No, we did not, we
<br>
detained less than a tenth of a percent, so stop making stupid
<br>
statements like that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's say tomorrow they put you in a detention camp. Maybe you wear the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong beard or they got the wrong address, whatever. Would it be okay for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, to be deprived of every chance to inform your family, speak to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer, tell your boss, try to clear the misunderstanding?
</em><br>
<p>You are again hyperbolizing. In ANY legal setting, someone who is
<br>
considered a material witness has no need of a lawyer, and if they do
<br>
have testimony against suspects, it is in their own interest to be
<br>
sequestered to protect them from being tampered with. As for suspects,
<br>
they only have a right to speak to a lawyer once they have been arrested
<br>
and charged.
<br>
<p>Now, the fact is that over 5,000 people have been brought in for
<br>
questioning over the last 4 months, and of those, over 100 have been
<br>
charged with criminal acts, and a few hundred are being legally detained
<br>
as material witnesses against being tampered with by insurgents
<br>
remaining at large.
<br>
<p>If your family is aware that you've been detained, then it logically
<br>
follows that they have been sufficiently informed. If you are a suspect,
<br>
and there is evidence against you, and it is believed that your
<br>
compatriots are still at large, then it is a reasonable assumption on
<br>
the part of law enforcement that they may try to break you out of jail,
<br>
so keeping your location secret is not out of line. 
<br>
<p>Finally: We are at war, and they are not citizens or non-combatants we
<br>
are dealing with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, the Geneva convention was made for &quot;regular&quot; wars, where the parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be clearly identified. I haven't seen detention camps for suspected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mafia members yet.
</em><br>
<p>Combatting the Mafia is not a War, it is a matter of civil crime. The
<br>
Geneva Conventions do not cover civil conflicts within a country, but
<br>
they do cover conflicts between countries.
