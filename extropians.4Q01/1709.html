From: &quot;Brian Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:brian@posthuman.com?Subject=Re:%20Religion%20is%20probably%20a%20good%20thing&In-Reply-To=&lt;02c301c15da6$789d17c0$3a5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">brian@posthuman.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Up until this general part of history at least. I was watching some PBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last night, and they were doing a piece on the guy who originally made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the claims about a &quot;God spot&quot; in the brain (only, he says the media mis-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reported his comments... that's another story). There was also a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interview with a guy who suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy who after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having a seizure would find himself in an extreme &quot;joy mode&quot; where anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he looked at or thought about would seem to be imbued with extreme meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and beauty.
</em><br>
<p>The PBS show was called &quot;Secrets of The Mind&quot; [ie, brain], and the guy who
<br>
theorized the &quot;g&quot; spot in the brain is Dr. V. S. Ramachandran, an imminent and
<br>
brilliant neuroscience researcher.
<br>
See:
<br>
&quot;God and the Temporal
<br>
Lobes of the Brain&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.godless.org/sci/ramachandran.html">http://www.godless.org/sci/ramachandran.html</a>
<br>
A neurophysiologist born in India, Ramachandran feels that  many of the
<br>
findings of modern neurophysiology can be interpreted as helping to teach the
<br>
ancient Hindu lesson of &quot;maya,&quot; or illusion.  That is, he says, what we learn
<br>
is that while the world itself may be real enough, our own individual sense of
<br>
being a &quot;self&quot; that is in some way aloof  from that &quot;creation&quot; is an illusion.
<br>
Several object lessons  were presented to this effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if the brain has built in hardware for creating these feelings, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to produce religion in societies (and we can see why epileptic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;prophets&quot; in olden times would be exactly the people expected to write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff like the Bible and other religious documents), it must have evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a reason.
</em><br>
<p>Then again, it may just be a defect, with no &quot;reason&quot; at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People with this hardware are more likely to survive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, people with this hardware are more likely to establish
<br>
religious monasteries, become monks and priests, and never have children.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Societies of these people are more likely to outcompete other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups of people who don't have it.
</em><br>
<p>Just the opposite, because these people object to competition, and emphasize
<br>
compassion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps it allows these groups of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to &quot;stop worrying&quot; and get on with work that might help them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive?
</em><br>
<p>Well, from the looks of it, their cathedrals, mosques, temples, pyramids and
<br>
other such edifices seem to take an inordinate amount of resources, and
<br>
prevent them getting on with productive work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or is religion just a fluke- the brain hardware only seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate feelings of deep meaning and &quot;joy&quot;, perhaps feeling attached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your surroundings and people helped those people and societies do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, and later on those feelings got interpreted by individuals to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be significant- boom, you get religions.
</em><br>
<p>Bingo! When you take schizophrenics seriously, you can get into all sorts of
<br>
paranoid delusionary theories and belief systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to ask yourself- if people didn't have these feelings, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for instance) the USA have grown quite as fast and well as it has?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would the world have otherwise developed a bit more slowly without these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;positive outlook&quot; individuals?
</em><br>
<p>According to Ramachandran, if people didn't have these feelings, they would
<br>
have more direct and accurate perception of reality. But you're right -- if
<br>
people didn't have these feelings, then it would not have seemed so urgent for
<br>
the American pioneers to leave Europe and other parts of the world to escape
<br>
from them. These &quot;positive outlook&quot; individuals are, of course, responsible
<br>
for much of the development of modern mythology and LSD psychedelia in the US.
<br>
But that more entropic than extropic.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
