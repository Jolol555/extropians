<p>
Newfound world of tiny RNA proves huge
<br>
<a href="http://news.bmn.com/news/story?day=011026&story=1">http://news.bmn.com/news/story?day=011026&story=1</a>
<br>
<p>Molecular biologists are going to have to rethink transcription, said a
<br>
leading RNA expert today. Tiny RNA - RNA that is only about 22 nucleotides
<br>
long - is big news.
<br>
Overnight, the number of known members of the tiny RNA family, known to play a
<br>
role in regulating gene expression, has ballooned from two to more than 70.
<br>
But it won't stop there says Volker Erdmann, professor at the Free University
<br>
in Berlin. &quot;This is just the peak of an iceberg,&quot; Erdmann told BioMedNet News
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>Erdmann was responding to news that three separate research teams in the US
<br>
and Germany have simultaneously unearthed a huge family of evolutionarily
<br>
conserved tiny RNA molecules.
<br>
<p>Erdmann, one of few RNA experts not involved in these projects, says that his
<br>
own research with tiny RNA suggests these molecules will be of &quot;great value&quot;
<br>
in the future of molecular medicine.
<br>
<p>Two tiny RNA molecules called lin-4 and let-7, the full extent of the family
<br>
identified to date, had previously been shown to switch off mRNA translation
<br>
during different stages of Caenorhabditis elegans development. But a team led
<br>
by David Bartel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has unearthed a
<br>
massive 55 previously unknown tiny RNAs from C. elegans.
<br>
<p>Another team, led by Victor Ambros at the Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover,
<br>
New Hampshire, independently identified 15 tiny RNAs (including many found by
<br>
Bartel). Ambros also found three sequences with apparent homologs in insects
<br>
and mammals.
<br>
<p>A third team showed that humans also have tiny RNA. A team led by Tom Tuschl
<br>
at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, Germany,
<br>
identified 19 different tiny RNAs in human cells, as well as 14 in Drosophila.
<br>
<p>Tiny RNA molecules may have gone unnoticed both precisely because they are
<br>
tiny, suggests David Bartel, and also because they are RNA.
<br>
<p>&quot;Most people haven't been looking for 'riboregulators',&quot; Bartel told BioMedNet
<br>
News. &quot;If they're looking for something that is modulating gene expression,
<br>
they would expect it to be a protein.&quot; So biochemists would have overlooked
<br>
RNA altogether.
<br>
<p>Molecular biologists, on the other hand, would have encountered the size
<br>
problem. &quot;These very, very small RNAs would have run off the bottoms of gels
<br>
in most searches for expressed RNAs,&quot; said Bartel. So the tiny RNAs lay
<br>
undiscovered.
<br>
<p>Tuschl and Bartel were already aware of each others' work, but Ambros had to
<br>
write up his results quickly when he found out what was going on. The
<br>
manuscripts from all three teams were accepted for publication in Science, but
<br>
since they had all invented different names for their tiny RNAs, the journal
<br>
asked them to come up with a uniform nomenclature.
<br>
<p>&quot;We had a great time coordinating things,&quot; said Ambros. They settled on
<br>
Bartel's suggestion of ditching the tiny in favor of micro; the molecules are
<br>
now called microRNAs. (&quot;Micro sounds more official,&quot; said Ambros.) The results
<br>
of all three teams appear tomorrow in Science.
<br>
<p>Ambros says the accumulated data barely scratch the surface of the microRNA
<br>
world. He estimates there are at least 200 microRNAs in C. elegans alone, with
<br>
about 5-10% conserved in human and mouse genomes. He expects homologs will
<br>
also be found in plants, and is about to start looking for them in fungi.
<br>
<p>Researchers will eagerly seek the function of these very small RNAs. Ambros
<br>
and Bartel expect that they will extend well beyond the post-transcriptional
<br>
function of lin-4 and let-7, the only microRNAs investigated so far.
<br>
<p>One obvious question, given discovery of a whole new gene class, is whether
<br>
any members could be involved in human disease. People usually search for
<br>
disease genes among protein coding sequences, Ambros says. Once again, tiny
<br>
RNAs are being overlooked.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hopefully human geneticists are paying attention,&quot; said Ambros.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
