<em>&gt; I have to disagree with you on this one!  Higher intelligence will tend to make the rich richer.  Look at our present-day society, those with higher then normal I.Q.'s do tend to do better financially.  Of course(and this has already been argued on the 
</em><br>
list), there are various forms of intelligence(or &quot;abilities&quot;) which assist one in gaining financial and social success.
<br>
<p>Just because the therapy will be expensive initially does not mean it
<br>
will remain such. Given that the patent on such a process will only last
<br>
20 years from the date of application, and given that it will take
<br>
likely 5-10 years for the FDA to approve such a procedure, then this
<br>
means that the rich only have a 10-15 year head start, at best. Likely
<br>
such procedures will be in such high demand that the unitary cost will
<br>
drop rather rapidly despite patent protections (and who doubts that some
<br>
nations will refuse to recognise the validity of such an important
<br>
patent?).
