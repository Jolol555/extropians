<em>&gt;From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Aid%20for%20Afghanistan&In-Reply-To=&lt;200112311634.IAA11831@well.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, we and the other countries should first and foremost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insure that a bunch of actual goods - food, clothing, shelter -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are delivered pronto before it is too late for large numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Afghani people. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree, and this is already happening, far more aid is entering
<br>
Afghanistan today then under the Taliban, and with our assistance
<br>
and that of the international community, a great deal more is on
<br>
the way.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2) Give the U.N. a bunch of money and let them figure it out.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That is a better solution that having us in charge of it imho.  
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't agree. the U.S. needs to work on it's image, and part of
<br>
that is to do the work ourselves and not hide behind the U.N.
<br>
<p>I think we have a vested interest in limiting the power of the U.N.
<br>
as well. (I don't support the idea of a world government.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This is after the current state of emergency need is in hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yes?  
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Why only US contractors?  We are not the only kids on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;block.  And I do not believe that it should be us that runs this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program.  It must come more from a broader base and largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depend on the Afghani government in its details or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government is a sham and will be seen as such.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree that this should be as a result of close collaboration with
<br>
the government of Afghanistan and the world community. I did not
<br>
mean to imply that we should run the program, just our part.
<br>
<p>In the past we simply handed over a check and the governments lined
<br>
their pockets or like Yasser Arafat bought themselves helicopters.
<br>
<p>We should let them tell us what they need, and if we are willing,
<br>
then pay U.S. contractors to do the necessary work. U.S.
<br>
contractors because this is taxpayer money, and it would do U.S.
<br>
citizens/companies good to be involved. If other governments
<br>
/companies want to do certain work, they can foot the bill.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;The first aid is enough food to get the country through until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any such crops can be harvested.
</em><br>
<p><p>Agreed, I just wanted to make it clear that we should encourage
<br>
this priority for their own good. We want to avoid helping to
<br>
create a welfare state/nation.
