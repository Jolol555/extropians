The key thing is not the anthrax bacteria. It is slow growing and can be hit
<br>
with Cipro. The military solution is to extract the toxin from the bacteria.
<br>
No antibiotic is going to help you. I would rather risk small injections of
<br>
anthrax serum (as well as botulism) until I had built up an immunity if the
<br>
threat became serious.
<br>
<p>Anyone know the incidents of side effect of anthrax or botulism serum. My
<br>
guess is it is no more serious than serum for plant allegens.

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; See, this is what I'm talking about. Crossing the fine line between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; disbelieving our own gov's propoganda and believing the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'll try to clarify my point.  There is no need to assign them the charge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; killing every american to make them the bad guys, and there is no need
</em><br>
for them
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to want to kill every american to make them the bad guys.  I do believe

they are
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the bad guys (or at least, the worse guys).  I do not believe they want
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; every american.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The problem is one of focus and opportunity. Take one bin Laden fanboy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Give said fanboy a plan and the means to execute said plan. He doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much care WHICH Americans he kills, just so long as he bags his limit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Much like a hunter shooting at a flock of birds with a shotgun: he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't much care which individual bird he kills, so long as he kills as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many as he is legally allowed. For all practical purposes, from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;standpoint of each individual bird, the hunter wants to kill each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual as much as any other individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From this standpoint, bin Laden therefore wants to kill ME, YOU, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John Clark, as well as every other American. It's nothing personal, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he's not aiming for us as individuals, he's just hoping to nail as many
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
