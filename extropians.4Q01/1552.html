Emlyn, I agree with yo--the Jesuit analogy was half meant in jest. What we
<br>
want to do is educate our children not indoctrinate them. Some cynics think
<br>
there is no real distinction between these activities, i.e., 'education' is
<br>
simply a term of praise for a type of indoctrination we find favorable. It
<br>
seems to me there is a difference in terms of the goals of these
<br>
enterprises. The telos of education is to engender understanding, the
<br>
purpose of indoctrination is to inculcate belief. Thus, one could be the
<br>
best educated person on the planet about Darwinian theory and still not
<br>
believe that it is true. On the other hand, one would not be successfully
<br>
indoctrinated in Darwinian theory unless one believed Darwinian theory. What
<br>
I am suggesting is that we might have to ask ourselves whether a necessary
<br>
condition for furthering transhumanism is to educate the young about
<br>
transhumanism, not indoctrinating them a la the Jesuits. The problem of
<br>
course is that, unlike children, most adults are not prediposed to exploring
<br>
or adopting radically different belief systems. If this is the case then
<br>
transhumanism may be destined to remain on the margins of the periphery of
<br>
society for the foreseeable future.
