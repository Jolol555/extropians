<p>Beg pardon? What on Earth made you go off like that? My &quot;Pfft&quot; was a dismissal of the notion that anyone with a freezer

contract is a chicken.

<p><em>&gt; I see a certain &quot;crazy&quot; but necessary at times power in risking one's life in sadly needed situations of intense risk and potential violence.

<p>Absolutely. Nothing I wrote made any different point, except perhaps in your (and I suppose some others') minds.
<br>
Kindly clue up, dear sir. See below: getting frozen is *at least* fourth on my list. Claro?
<br>
I might not be a super-Klingon, but I have my bloodyminded moments, you damn betcha.
<br>
There are plenty of ways I could die that would not lead to getting frozen. Always have been.
<br>
Getting frozen is a long shot. I know that. I don't cling to that, I hook a pinky. Jinx! :)

<p>&quot;No time for that now, Timmy, there's work to be done!&quot; :) 
<br>
<p>Thanks for the good wishes.
