<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Animism is the earliest form of religion. It stems from the human instinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to model everything as if it were another human. My take on this is that, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a child, the only way to learn to be human is to treat everything else as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it were human until proven wrong. This trait persists into adulthood. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive times, you can imagine people trying to understand any complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system (tree, river, weather, etc) by acting as though it had a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persona behind it. Coincidence and human nature being what it is, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually build up a nice self-consistant delusional world this way where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's hard to be proven wrong about what is controlling the river, weather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>It could also be that we make use of a well-developed
<br>
human-modelling system: it evolved to deal with other humans in the
<br>
tribe, but it was so general it could be applied to model other
<br>
complex systems too. This exaption might have been a big step
<br>
upwards in intelligence: by treating external stuff as agents it
<br>
became possible to manipulate just like humans (&quot;Fire *likes* to go
<br>
upwards and is fairly stupid, so if I angle the branch this way I
<br>
can carry it without being burned&quot;). This overdeveloped
<br>
agent-modelling system is also a likely explanation for much
<br>
religion. 
<br>
<p>I wonder if there is another parallel modelling system beside the
<br>
agent modeller: linguistic modelling, which has be exapted into
<br>
mathematics and other formal systems. Maybe future forms of
<br>
intelligence amplification will mainly be about finding subsystems
<br>
of our thinking that can be extended by improved modelling,
<br>
offloading our working memory and general intelligence. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is why the future will resemble the animistic past. We will try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build a world that resonates with our preferences for memes, myths and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories. We will build spirits (AIs), we will try to become immortal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cryonics, any number of other potential technologies), we will attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcent, to become Gods, heroes, kamis (uploading, inloading, outloading,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, we will change our fundamental selves, but the initial builders of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman world will be humans. Before the spirits and Gods are let go to th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eir own devices, they will have been designed and built by humans and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close to humans.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is spot on. There are of course other factors
<br>
affecting what gets built or not, but this is what we *like* to
<br>
build when we are not constrained in other ways. It will be
<br>
interesting to see how stable this template is when the fundamental
<br>
human condition (from which it was created from) changes - it is
<br>
likely that we and our mindchildren will then create new kinds of
<br>
myths, producing further changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) The need for awe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans have a need for awe, for something percieved as far greater than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, something that touches them and speaks to them. This can be a God, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of how the stars work, QCD, an appreciation of the true size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe, etc, etc. It's another of those hardwired things in the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, although I really don't have a good hypothesis for the existence this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An examination of my own thoughts and reactions shows that my astrophysical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training has left me lacking in need for religious (or other artificial)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources of awe. Just thinking about the universe as it is understood today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is enough of a &quot;wow&quot; moment. I suspect that this is one of the reasons for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so many scientists being atheists. It can't just be astrophysics that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides good sources of awe.
</em><br>
<p>In my case it is mathematics and biology, but the feeling is the
<br>
same: touching something greater, something immeasurably true,
<br>
powerful or elegant. My guess is that it is a reaction to
<br>
discovering an extreme power greater than oneself and integrating
<br>
it in one's worldview - a forced accomodation of one's schemas, but
<br>
often pleasurable because it is meaningful and will likely
<br>
influence future behaviour.  It feels very dopaminergic :-) 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; A consideration of any one of the postulated post-human futures in all its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glory is pretty damn awe-inspiring too.
</em><br>
<p>I guess a worthwile life goal would be to live a life so that every
<br>
moment would be awe inspiring to any previous self. Today I'm a
<br>
real scientist - that would have awed my childhood self. Tomorrow I
<br>
am hopefully posthuman, something that awes me now. After
<br>
posthumanity, I hope to strive for something even greater.
