<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;What is &quot;supposed to be about terrorism&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;If we are attempting to find solutions to terrorism then it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;important to understand where it comes from and why.  If part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the why is the grievances various countries and entities have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;against US policies then the question comes up as to whether any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of those grievances have merit and whether we are in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;sometimes acting in oppressive manner in other countries and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;we might do to change that if so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are not looking for the solution to terrorism at the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time, we are looking for the terrorists who committed a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; act and their supporters. We are out to destroy them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is contrary to what Bush is claiming about this war.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are out to end terrorism from what I have heard him say.  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not out only against the particular ones who carried out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9/11 attacks but all terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we are not looking for a solution then this is just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vengeance.  It is not even about protecting ourselves from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further terrorism or, to the extent possible, making terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less likely in the world.  Why should we have an unlimited and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unbounded committment to only that?
</em><br>
<p>We already know what the solution is: a full metal jacket.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The reasons they hate us are many, largely it seems because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are taught lies in Pakistani maddrasas, and are broadcast bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lies via Al-Jazeera television.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is utterly simplistic.  To say that all who are angry with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us are dupes and liars is surely obviously biased and unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be accurate.  For one thing it denies real events that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angered many in that part of the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;If it makes sense to agree to an open-ended &quot;war&quot; to root out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;all actual terrorists from anywhere and everywhere then surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;it also makes sense to understand the roots and to work to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;lessen the seeds of future terrorism where/if we can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Good idea, close the maddrassas, shut down Al-Jazeera....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Al-Jazeera is one of the few relatively independent voices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the area.  I thought we are supposed to be for a free press.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or does that only apply in America and other rules apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere else if they say unpleasant things about us?  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we believe in free speech.  Only here?
</em><br>
<p>You, in your inimitable leftie way, seem to be conflating 'independent'
<br>
with 'unbiased'. Al Jazeera's idea of a good 'Crossfire' type panel
<br>
would be the muslim equivalent of having David Duke on the right and
<br>
Jerry Fallwell on the left, with Pat Buchanan and Ralph Reed as the
<br>
hosts.
<br>
<p>Al Jazeera broadcasts from Qatar with a western appearance but an
<br>
editorial agenda more like that of the Taliban than not. Qatar is
<br>
nominally a Wahhabi state, and Al Jazeera is hated most in the muslim
<br>
world for skewering most other muslim governments EXCEPT for that of
<br>
Qatar. They get 'jew lover' hate mail if any commentator even mentions
<br>
the possibility that Israel's right to exist might be necessary to solve
<br>
the Palestine problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't see how the &quot;that alone&quot; makes any sense at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Especially when our government is certainly not after &quot;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;alone&quot; but after finding and neutralizing all terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;everywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are out to end this sort of thing on a permanent basis. We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sending a clear message: &quot;being a terrorist will get you hunted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down and killed, find another way to express your frustrations.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not the way to end terrorism.  It will not work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never has worked throughout history.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, it worked quite well on the native Americans. It also
<br>
worked quite well on my scottish ancestors. The Turks also succeeded
<br>
with it against Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler), who had terrorized the
<br>
Ottomans against further incursions into europe to such a degree he is
<br>
now known as Dracula. General Pershing used it quite well against the
<br>
muslim terrorists in the Phillipines in 1901. I generally like his
<br>
solution: shooting them with bullets dipped in pigfat, and burying them
<br>
in pigskin, defiles them such that they cannot become martyrs, no matter
<br>
how much they do to attack us.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Al-Jareeza happens to be the most independent and competent news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;source in the Mid East.  That some of its writers may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;espoused an alternate theory does not mean they are incompetent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;nincompoops.  Especially when the biases in other reports from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;more &quot;mainstream&quot; sources have also been quite evident.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Find me one piece of evidence that indicates the Israelis are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsible for Sept 11, and I will retract my opinion about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ridiculous Islamic tabloid known as Al-Jazeera.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your opinion based on one set of editorials is irrelevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether there is evidence of Israeli involvement or not is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the issue.  You are advocating blaming a particular publication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and shutting it down although it is not remotely any of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business to do any such thing and such attitudes and acting on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them are part of what pisses many off toward the US.
</em><br>
<p>I seem to recall that the lefties felt the same way during the Cold War
<br>
about such bastions of truth as Tass and Pravda, but didn't exhibit any
<br>
problem with the KGB regularly jamming the Voice of America radio
<br>
broadcasts....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;In point of fact, we do not know who was behind the attack yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;We have strong suspicion of it being bin Laden.  But I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;seen anything really strong enough to convict in an open court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You may not have seen anything that convinces you, but I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convinced long ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then present your evidence if you would.
</em><br>
<p>Roomates of Atta in Germany have been traced to Pakistan, to the Afghan
<br>
border near Quetta. Four of his associates escaped from Germany on
<br>
forged passports bearing stolen identities on a flight to Karachi, where
<br>
they stayed in the Embassy Hotel until they flew to Quetta and went
<br>
across the border into Afghanistan a few days prior to Sept 11th.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;To what end?  What are your objectives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Destroy Bin Laden/Al-Quaeda, destroy their Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supporters/allies, re-establish a viable government (democratic)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the people of Afghanistan, get out and go home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK.  That is at least much more modest than what Bush and co.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are proposing.  Getting bin Laden and changing the Afghani
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government are only the beginning for them.  On what basis will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you destroy the Taliban rather than simply deposing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government?  I don't see any righteous basis for us fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying them.
</em><br>
<p>This is inaccurate. Bush has specifically said that we are not into
<br>
nation building. Blair and the european nations of NATO are proposing
<br>
that the UN support the new government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I agree on bringing in UN peacekeepers and bringing in aid before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;winter comes on 100%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm glad we agree on this. I think the war should proceed with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fury to shorten it to the minimal possible time to achieve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objectives. Every day we delay, innocent people suffer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Destroying the Taliban utterly would cause a lot of innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering also.  As the Al-Qaeda is supposed to span multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries destroying it would not end at Afghanistan either.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where else would you see us march in for a military action?
</em><br>
<p>Iraq has been proven to have had multiple intelligence contacts with
<br>
Atta and a couple other of the hijackers. I'd send in a team to off
<br>
Hussein and send in massive support for the Kurds in the north and
<br>
Shiites in the south. Thirdly, I'd pressure governments like Egypt and
<br>
Saudi Arabia to pass hate crimes laws and institute democratic reforms.
<br>
Thirdly, I'd say that all airlines flying into the US must provide the
<br>
FBI with passenger manifests prior to takeoff or else their passengers
<br>
will all be strip searched. Currently, countries like Egypt, Saudi
<br>
Arabia, and several others who are not on anyone's list of nice people,
<br>
refuse to provide passenger manifests.
<br>
<p>I'd also ban Wahhabi funded Madrassas in the US on the grounds that they
<br>
are terrorist training schools. Until any given sect of islam
<br>
specifically states that it is given dogma that terrorism of any kind is
<br>
NOT jihad, members of those sects from anywhere in the world should be
<br>
denied entry to the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is the reason I think we should have taken major centers like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Kabul and Mazer-el-Sharif by now, to establish within the country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and out of Taliban control, safe zones for the people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Afghanistan. By releasing these centers immediatly to U.N. control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we demonstrate we have no intention of staying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the aftermath will be disappointing. I wouldn't support a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government for Afghanistan that didn't include things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universal suffrage, try selling that in an Islamic country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dunno.  Doesn't it already exist in Egypt and Jordan or some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the countries in the area that are largely Muslim?  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admittedly ignorant here.  I think there might be a real swing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from theocratic state in Afghanistan after their experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the Taliban.
</em><br>
<p>I would expect so only if there were a significant class of educated
<br>
Afghans. There is not, and the most educated ones are living in other
<br>
countries. Unless you have a significant influx of western trained
<br>
afghans into the country to reestablish its leadership class, I think
<br>
you will simply get a more mellow flavored version of the same old
<br>
thing.
