</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It could have undesirable consequences because the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is uncertain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly. Even what we think is right and good can turn out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be wrong in a longer time-frame. So all assumptions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social ideas have to be frequently reexamined and chnaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if new data requires it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree here, but there are two problems.  One is that both the
<br>
public and the government's attention will turn elsewhere.  In other
<br>
words, a program, such as Social Security, will be put in place to solve
<br>
a seeming problem, then basically forgotten about.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>### Yes, you are right, governement action tends to generate special
<br>
interests which parasitize the society. This has been extensively analyzed
<br>
by Jonathan Rauch in his &quot;Demosclerosis&quot;. Yet, it is not an argument against
<br>
the government as such, merely an argument against the government in its
<br>
present form. 
<br>
<p>So, no incontrovertible moral argument against coercive action yet.
<br>
<p>------ 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Whether such conditions would necessitate &quot;coercive intervention&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; another matter.  Wouldn't one want to err on the side of freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reason?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Always. Freedom and reason are right at the top of my &quot;good&quot; list.
</em><br>
<p>Then why coercion?  In my mind, force and reason are pretty much
<br>
opposites.  (The Objectivist influence on me.:)  Ergo, any initiation of
<br>
force means foregoing the use of reason.  Would you, e.g., give up the
<br>
scientific method or the laws of logic because you couldn't get the
<br>
results you desired in a specific experiment or argument?
<br>
<p>### &quot;Initiation of force&quot; is such a fluid concept. I do believe that
<br>
initially non-coercive systems spontaneously generate  coercive situations,
<br>
and then brute force is needed to prevent it from getting worse. 
<br>
<p>----- 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Again, yes, to some of it, except there would be no civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without governments.
</em><br>
<p>I see the causality going the other way: there could be no government or
<br>
no government over and above simple chiefs temporarily ruling small
<br>
bands without civilization.  Civilization, as it progresses, creates
<br>
huge amounts of wealth and capital that governments can live off.
<br>
Governments basically consume.  You should read Hoppe and others on
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>### Emphatically no. Read your Ayn Rand. Governments (starting at the
<br>
village chief level) are an unavoidable element in the development of
<br>
civilization, emerging spontaneously, like eusociality, or herd behaviors,
<br>
allowing coordinated activities and expanding the abilities of the society
<br>
as a whole. I sincerely doubt you could give me an example of an ungoverned
<br>
society achieving anything significant, especially survival among governed
<br>
ones. 
<br>
<p>As much as I loved reading &quot;The peace war&quot;, I do not believe it could come
<br>
true, definitely not without technical advances absent from human history so
<br>
far.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does it mean that your answer to my first question is a principled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No&quot; and any discussion is only an intellectual pastime?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not unwilling to change my morality, but it would take evidence and
<br>
argument -- not some vacuous claim about being openminded, but real,
<br>
hard data.
<br>
<p>### Very good - this is exactly what I think and I am glad you do not take a
<br>
dogmatic position on the main question that I posed. And of course, real,
<br>
hard data is needed before making life-and-death choices, open-mindedness
<br>
alone can cause your mind to fall out (as, I believe, Mike Lorrey once
<br>
wrote).
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Also, morality for me is not separate from empirical issues or reality.
<br>
In fact, I'm basically in the Objectivist and neo-Aristotelean
<br>
traditions here.  (I might add, I also agree with much of what Lawrence
<br>
C. Becker has to say in his _A New Stoicism_.  I mention him because
<br>
he's modernized stoicism and the result is quite good, IMHO.)  Since I
<br>
also think of politics as reality based, the same applies for it.  Note,
<br>
my arguments in this area are generally backed by historical examples.
<br>
<p>### Again a resounding yes. We have the same basics of reasoning, the
<br>
ethical metalogic. Let's get down to the nitty-gritty.
