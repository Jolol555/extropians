<em>&gt; &gt; It surprises me mightily that those who distrust the government,

<em>&gt; &gt; and do so with good cause, would now trust the government to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have wider and more uncontrolled and unscrutinized powers than

<em>&gt; &gt; it has ever had as long as they claim that these powers are &quot;for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your protection&quot;.  We must not deliver the people to goons in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; order to &quot;fight terrorism&quot;.  Terror begins at home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those of us who distrust the government trust these foreign infiltrators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and terrorists even less. Much as the Nationalists and Communist Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joined forces to fight the Japanese invaders, we must do the same. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals (and those of other freedom lovers) are anathema to the radical

<em>&gt; islamic world. They are a classic example that the enemy of one's enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not always one's friend. I, and others, can at least maintain our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assets and abilities while contributing to the fight, and if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government doesn't relinquish it's police powers when the conflict is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over, I will most certainly be involved in measures to force it to. Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not the time, though. We must renew the social trust by weeding out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who seek to undermine it permanently, and they should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treated with TLC.
</em><br>
<p><p>Please not that our officials are expecting a very long
<br>
conflict, say on the order of the rest of our lifetime, before
<br>
it is &quot;over&quot;.  That rather changes the equation in my book.  I

don't have a lifetime to screw around.
