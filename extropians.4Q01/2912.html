OK, here is why my interpretation of Bond's research contradicts the latest
<br>
news reports.  My memory is not going bad on me.  It appears that Bond has
<br>
radically re-interpreted his research in the last year.  He actually did
<br>
claim that his research proved that the sun was NOT responsible for these
<br>
weather cycles as recently as last year.  He now seems to interpret his
<br>
research to support the theory that a solar cycle is causing the weather
<br>
cycles.  I cannot find any information about whether he has any new data, or
<br>
if he is reinterpreting his data in a different way now.
<br>
<p>In any case, I can no longer support my previous statements concerning
<br>
Gerard Bond's research.  Although they were accurate and confirmed by the
<br>
researcher himself last year, he now seems to hold the opposite opinion.  I
<br>
can only assume that he has correct some errors or obtained some newer data.
<br>
In either case, it now appears that Bond now claims that his research
<br>
supports the theory that weather cycles are caused by slight cycles in solar
<br>
output.
<br>
<p>A brief history of Gerard Bond's research is below.
<br>
<p>In 1994, Time Magazine referenced Gerard Bond's research and stated that it
<br>
seemed to show that ocean currents were causing global weather cycles.
<br>
<p>-
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/archive/1994/940131/940131.science.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/archive/1994/940131/940131.science.html</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>In 1997, he announced his research findings.  He specifically studied
<br>
Antarctic ice, ice-berg drifts, and the dropping of sediment as they melted.
<br>
At that time, he did not know the cause of the 1500-1800 year weather
<br>
cycles, but did not think it was related to solar output.
<br>

<br>
<p>As of last year, he had decided that lunar cycles, not solar cycles were
<br>
definitely causing the fluctuations.  He specifically linked the cycles with
<br>
tides and sea levels around the world, and specifically discounted solar
<br>
output as a possibility.

<br>
<p>Now we have a rash of reports in which he seems to be using the same data to
<br>
prove that solar output is cycling, and is directly causing these cycles.  I
<br>
can find no mention of newer research, or a different description of what
<br>
his research reviewed.  It seems to be a direct contradiction of his earlier
<br>
positions.  I can only assume that some new data or new interpretation lead
<br>
to his new position.
<br>
<p>- &lt;<a href="http://fyi.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/11/16/solar.cycles.ap/">http://fyi.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/11/16/solar.cycles.ap/</a>&gt;

<br>
?coll=sns-ap-science-headlines&gt;
<br>
<p>There are many more reports and accounts of Gerard Bond's current position,
<br>
that it cannot be dismissed as an erroneous report.  He reportedly has
<br>
reversed his position and now supports the solar-cycle theory with his
<br>
research instead of refuting it.
<br>
<p>If anybody has any specific data about what caused the flip-flop, I would be
<br>
very interested to know.
