<p><p>Yes, its been done before.  It isn't a bad idea really, though you'd
<br>
probably have to have somewhat more complex gearing if you wanted the
<br>
transition to be automatic and transparent.  The downside is that this
<br>
feature almost certainly makes the vehicle more expensive.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, the makers of Big American Trucks (ever at the forefront of
<br>
heavy duty utility vehicle design) have been working on significant new
<br>
mechanical designs for power transfer that should substantially increase the
<br>
transfer efficiency from the engine to the ground.  These are supposed to be
<br>
coming to market in the next five years or so.  Improvements in engine
<br>
efficiency have lead to smaller engines in trucks over the years (for
<br>
equivalent effective output), and these mechanical improvements should in
<br>
theory make a V6 (or better, an inline 6) feel like a big V8 in actual
<br>
usage.
<br>
<p>I only get 12 miles per gallon with my 5.8L V8, but the truck is paid for
<br>
and the annual cost of using twice as much for fuel is far less than the
<br>
cost of replacing the truck.  And there is also the trust factor.  I have
<br>
been through the Gates of Hell and back with that truck, through some of the
<br>
most vicious terrain the world has to offer, and it has proven to be nigh
<br>
indestructible and unstoppable over the years.  I don't want to have to go
<br>
through the same trust building ordeal with a new vehicle (which may or may
<br>
not cut it) that I've been through with my old Bronco.  Part of the reason
<br>
the basic designs haven't changed much is that a significant part of the
<br>
market for them value rugged proven reliability above all else.  When you
<br>
are 40 miles from the nearest house in very unfriendly terrain, you don't
<br>
want to have to walk for help.  If that means a simple, reliable, but
<br>
sub-optimally fuel efficient design, so be it.
