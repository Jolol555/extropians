<p>
A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax
<br>
<p>Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, Federation of American Scientists
<br>
revised December 10, 2001
<br>
<p><p>All the available evidence indicates that the source of the mailed anthrax,
<br>
or the information and materials to make it, is a US government program.
<br>
ANTHRAX STRAIN
<br>
<p>All letter samples contain the same strain of anthrax, corresponding to the
<br>
AMES strain in the N. Arizona State University database (which has been used
<br>
for identification). The Ames substrain possessed by N. Arizona State is
<br>
referred to herein as the &quot;reference strain.&quot; That strain was obtained from
<br>
Porton Down (UK) in the mid-90's (the sample was marked &quot;October 1932&quot;);
<br>
Porton had gotten it from Fort Detrick.
<br>
<p>A 2000 paper by M. Hugh-Jones, PJ Jackson, P. Keim et al says that the Ames
<br>
strain played a central role in the US BW program [i.e., before 1969].
<br>
Hugh-Jones says he learned that from David Huxsoll, Former Commander,
<br>
USAMRIID. However, he says Vollum 1B was the strain stockpiled (at least in
<br>
the early days of the US biological weapons program). The search for better
<br>
strains undoubtedly continued, leading the US program to prefer the Ames
<br>
strain because of its high virulence.
<br>
<p>The Ames strain is used now in the US biodefense program for testing
<br>
vaccines etc.
<br>
<p>The Ames reference strain in the N. Arizona collection is probably the
<br>
earliest Ames substrain (isolated in 1925 and sealed in 1928, perhaps
<br>
subcultured in 1932).
<br>
<p>There are at least four Ames substrains, all under the control of Fort
<br>
Detrick. They were isolated by laboratories in Ames, Iowa but were not
<br>
subsequently studied or distributed by them.
<br>
<p>Undoubtedly the confusion about Ames substrains could be cleared up by
<br>
USAMRIID, but they have been evasive.
<br>
<p><p>WEAPONIZATION
<br>
<p>&quot;Weaponization&quot; is used here to mean preparation of the form of anthrax
<br>
found in the Daschle letter: fine particles, very narrow size range, treated
<br>
to eliminate static charge so it won't clump and will float in the air. The
<br>
weaponization process used was extraordinarily effective. The particles have
<br>
a narrow size range (1.5-3 microns diameter), typical of the US process.
<br>
<p>The extraordinary concentration (one trillion spores per gram) and purity of
<br>
the letter anthrax is believed to be characteristic of material made by the
<br>
US process.
<br>
<p>A reporter who writes on anthrax vaccine has privately stated that four labs
<br>
have told him that under the electron microscope the appearance of the
<br>
sample is like that of unmilled anthrax spores. Milled samples are
<br>
identifiable because they contain debris. The optimal US process did not use
<br>
milling.
<br>
<p>The US weaponization process is secret-Bill Patrick, its inventor, says it
<br>
involves a COMBINATION of chemicals.
<br>
<p>The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (Washington DC) is studying the
<br>
anthrax using an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope, which can detect the
<br>
presence of extremely tiny quantities of chemicals; traces of several
<br>
chemicals have been found.
<br>
<p>The Senate sample contains a special form of silica used in the US process.
<br>
It does not contain bentonite (used by the Iraqis).
<br>
<p>All the letters probably contained the same material. The clumping of the
<br>
anthrax in the two letters mailed on Sept 18 (to NBC and the NY Post)
<br>
probably resulted from the letters getting wet in the course of mail
<br>
processing or delivery, according to Army scientists. This conclusion is
<br>
strengthened by the similarity of the Florida anthrax (the first to be
<br>
observed, probably also mailed on Sept 18) to that in the Daschle letter,
<br>
mailed Oct 9.
<br>
<p><p>ANTHRAX PRODUCTION
<br>
<p>A study of genetic drift at certain locations in anthrax is underway at
<br>
Northern Arizona State University. The results are expected to give an idea
<br>
of how many times the letter anthrax had replicated, in comparison to the
<br>
reference strain-ie, whether it was grown on a very large scale (as in a
<br>
State program) or on a very small scale, as would be likely if recently made
<br>
by a terrorist.
<br>
<p>Analysis of trace contaminants could also indicate the scale/method of
<br>
production (ie, liquid medium, in a fermenter, or solid medium, on petri
<br>
dishes, a likely method for small-scale preparation).
<br>
<p><p>OTHER ANALYSES
<br>
<p>It has just been reported that the complete sequence has been determined for
<br>
the genomes of both the anthrax used in the Florida attack and the Ames
<br>
reference strain to which it corresponds. This work was done under
<br>
government contract by the Institute for Genomic Research, a private
<br>
non-profit organization. The results have not been made public but they are
<br>
in government hands and there has been no retraction of the oft-repeated
<br>
official statement that the letter anthrax matches the Ames reference strain.
<br>
<p>In addition, sequence data will reveal whether the Ames reference strain is
<br>
a mixture of types, as sequencing has revealed to be the case for another
<br>
anthrax strain. If so, the proportions of the mixture may differ from lab to
<br>
lab and could be used to identify the source.
<br>
<p>Senator Bob Graham, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in
<br>
late October that investigators can identify with great certainty which lab
<br>
produced the anthrax, but it will be a laborious, time-consuming process.
<br>
(Chicago Tribune, 27 Oct 01).
<br>
<p><p>SOURCE LOCATION
<br>
<p>Contrary to early speculation, there are no more than about 20 laboratories
<br>
known to have obtained the Ames strain from Fort Detrick. The names of 15 of
<br>
these laboratories have been found in the open literature (see Appendix). Of
<br>
these, probably only about four in the US might possibly have the capability
<br>
for weaponizing anthrax. These include both US military laboratories and
<br>
government contractors.
<br>
<p><p>INFORMATION REGARDING THE PERPETRATOR
<br>
<p>Analysts believe the letters were not written by a Middle-Easterner. The FBI
<br>
publicly conjectures that the perpetrator was a lone, male domestic
<br>
terrorist, obviously one with a scientific background and lab experience who
<br>
could handle hazardous materials.
<br>
<p>The perpetrator must have received anthrax vaccine recently (it requires a
<br>
yearly booster shot), whether or not he made the material himself, because
<br>
filling the letters was a dangerous operation. The vaccine is in short
<br>
supply and is not generally accessible. Vaccination records must be
<br>
available.
<br>
<p>The perpetrator appears to be a forensic expert. In preparing and mailing
<br>
the letters he successfully covered every personal trace.
<br>
<p><p>TIMING
<br>
<p>There was only one week between Sept 11 and Sept 18, when the first two
<br>
letters (and probably another letter, never found, to AMI) were postmarked.
<br>
This suggests that the anthrax was already in hand before Sept 11.
<br>
<p>Did the perpetrator have advance knowledge of the Sept 11 attacks? Secretary
<br>
of Defense Rumsfeld has said that he does not believe al Qaeda was
<br>
responsible for the anthrax attack, and other public officials have
<br>
increasingly indicated that the perpetrator was probably domestic.
<br>
<p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS
<br>
<p>At first, US officials provided miscellaneous bits of information, some
<br>
conflicting; then denied some of the earlier information, then clammed up.
<br>
They now have a great deal of information that has not been made public.
<br>
Under pressure from leaks, they have started a gradual release of
<br>
information again.
<br>
<p>The US rejected a UN resolution offered by France to condemn the anthrax
<br>
attack, on the grounds that it could have been domestic terrorism.
<br>
<p>The Secretary of Health and Human Services said in October that some of the
<br>
relevant information is classified, and some is restricted by the FBI.
<br>
<p>John Bolton, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International
<br>
Security, spoke on Nov. 19 at the opening of the five-yearly Review
<br>
Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva. At a press
<br>
conference following his talk, he said &quot;We don't know, as I say in the
<br>
statement, at the moment, in a way that we could make public, where the
<br>
anthrax attacks came from.&quot; This statement, as well as other information,
<br>
indicates that US officials DO know where the anthrax came from.
<br>
<p>The FBI says it is now investigating government and contractor laboratories
<br>
possessing the Ames strain, and individuals who had access to them. Col.
<br>
Arthur Friedlander, Sr. Research Scientist at USAMRIID, said no one there
<br>
knows how to make dry weaponsized anthrax.
<br>
<p>According to the New York Times (2 Dec 01), a law enforcement official close
<br>
to the federal investigation called the concept of a government insider, or
<br>
someone in contact with an insider, &quot;the most likely hypothesis.it's
<br>
definitely reasonable.&quot; An American official sympathetic to this thesis was
<br>
quoted in the same article saying that, in addition to military
<br>
laboratories, &quot;there are other government and contractor facilities that do
<br>
classified work with access to dangerous strains, but it's highly likely
<br>
that the material in the anthrax letters came from a person or persons who
<br>
really had great expertise. We haven't seen any other artifacts that point
<br>
us elsewhere.&quot;
<br>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle, recipient of one of the anthrax
<br>
letters, has been in frequent contact with investigators. He said on Dec 8
<br>
that the perpetrator was probably someone with a military background.
<br>
<p><p>MOST LIKELY HYPOTHESIS
<br>
<p>The perpetrator is probably an American microbiologist who has access to
<br>
weaponized anthrax or to the expertise and materials for making it, in a US
<br>
government or contractor lab. He does not live in or near Trenton, but more
<br>
probably in the Washington, DC area. Trenton is probably accessible to him
<br>
(it is a stop on the Amtrak line that runs along the East coast), but if he
<br>
is smart enough to handle anthrax he is smart enough not to mail it from his
<br>
home town.
<br>
<p>The anthrax in the letters was probably made and weaponized in a US
<br>
government or contractor lab. It might have been made recently by the
<br>
perpetrator on his own, or made as part of the US biodefense program; or it
<br>
may be a remnant of the US biological weapons program before Nixon
<br>
terminated the program in 1969.
<br>
Weaponization of dry anthrax after 1972, when the Biological Weapons
<br>
Convention was signed, could be construed as a violation of the Convention.
<br>
<p>The motive of the perpetrator was not necessarily to kill but to create
<br>
public fear, thereby raising the profile of BW. He simply took advantage of
<br>
Sept 11 to throw suspicion elsewhere. The letters warned of anthrax or the
<br>
need to take antibiotics, making it possible for those who handled the
<br>
letters to protect themselves; and it seems unlikely that the perpetrator
<br>
would have anticipated that the rough treatment of mail in letter sorters
<br>
etc, would force anthrax spores through the pores of the envelopes (which
<br>
were taped to keep the anthrax inside) and infect postal workers and others.
<br>
The choice of media as targets seems to have been cleverly designed to
<br>
ensure publicity about the threat of biological weapons. One can only
<br>
speculate that the perpetrator may have wished to push the US government
<br>
toward retaliatory action against some enemy, or to attract funding or
<br>
recognition to some program with which he is associated.
<br>
The choice of Senators Daschle and Leahy as targets may be a clue that has
<br>
yet to be deciphered.
<br>
<p>The US government has undoubtedly known for some time that the anthrax
<br>
terrorism was an inside job. They may be reluctant to admit this. They also
<br>
may not yet have adequate hard evidence to convict the perpetrator.
<br>
In opposition to most of the countries of the world, the Bush administration
<br>
turned down a Protocol to monitor compliance with the ban on biological
<br>
weapons last July. In so doing it reversed the policy of the previous three
<br>
administrations aimed at strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention,
<br>
which lacks verification measures. The action put the US at odds with most
<br>
of its allies and fueled accusations of US unilateralism, according to the
<br>
Washington Times (Dec 5).
<br>
<p>The anthrax attacks have had no effect on administration policy. At the
<br>
start of a five-yearly Biological Weapons Convention Review Conference last
<br>
month, Under-Secretary Bolton caused dissention by accusing several parties
<br>
to the Convention of violating it. On Dec 7, the last day of the conference,
<br>
the US doublecrossed its European allies by reversing a compromise agreement
<br>
of the previous day, thereby causing an uproar and derailing the Conference.
<br>
According to European diplomats, failure of the conference sends the message
<br>
that the international community is not willing to enforce the ban on
<br>
biological weapons.
<br>
<p><p>Conclusions: A recent report by the Congressional GAO, as well as many
<br>
recent statements by military and non-governmental experts in the BW field,
<br>
holds that terrorists are unlikely to be able to mount a major biological
<br>
attack without substantial assistance from a government sponsor. The recent
<br>
anthrax attack was a minor one but nonetheless we now see that it was
<br>
perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government
<br>
program. It is reassuring to know that it was not perpetrated by a lone
<br>
terrorist without state support.
<br>
<p>It is not reassuring, however, to discover that a secret US program may have
<br>
been the source of that support, and that security is so dangerously lax in
<br>
military or defense contractor laboratories. US government insistence on
<br>
pursuing and maintaining the secrecy of elaborate biological threat
<br>
assessment activities is undermining the prohibitions of the Biological
<br>
Weapons Convention and encouraging biological weapons proliferation in other
<br>
countries, which in turn may support bioterrorist attacks on the American
<br>
public.
