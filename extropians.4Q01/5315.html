</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>A worthy question. Some possibilities: 
<br>
(po) Other countries have been sorted for compliant populations
<br>
(po) US &quot;melting pot&quot; is lumpy
<br>
(po) US has many more stupid laws
<br>
(po) US does a better job of enforcing stupid laws
<br>
(po) Other countries under-report their crimes compared to US
<br>
(po) A relatively few people in the US commit an average of more detected crimes than elsewhere
<br>
<p>I have no way of determining which, if any of these is &quot;the&quot; &quot;cause&quot; of 
<br>
any discrepancy. So I stop. You are free to puzzle, or think you've reached
<br>
some conclusion. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Actually, firearms, as technological instruments of individual
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firearms empower to what? To kill. I can't find this extropian. Like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proverb says: For some one with only a hammer, everything looks like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nail. Someone who has a gun has no need to think about better alternatives.
</em><br>
<p>What _are_ you talking about? I have a gun, and I think of better alternatives
<br>
every day. So does every person I know who owns a firearm. So do most cops here.
<br>
Speaking for myself and the people I know, it's empowering to realize that one
<br>
_doesn't_ have a solution to every problem just because one owns a few ounces of
<br>
low explosive wrapped in metal. One, dare I say it, _grows up_. But there are others,
<br>
it's true.
<br>
<p>Have you heard of the Happy Land Social Club fire in the Bronx? One dollar's worth of
<br>
gasoline, one disgruntled man, one narrow staircase in an unlicensed dance club==
<br>
87 people dead.
<br>
<p>I recast my questions from a divergent thread which you might not have read
<br>
(the thread is &quot;Re: The Friendly Skies meets &quot;Schedule Suntan&quot;, Fwd: Nekkid Air&quot;,
<br>
and my original post has an interesting New York Times article quoted at the end;
<br>
Anders and others have posted some thoughtful replies):
<br>
<p>(1) If you can't trust an ordinary person with a few ounces of low explosive
<br>
wrapped in metal, how can you ever trust any person with the foreseeable 
<br>
technologies of the near future? (any suitably powerful/dangerous technology)
<br>
<p>(2) What magic transforms an ordinary person into a trustworthy person?
<br>
<p>I'm particularly interested in your answer given your .signature line.
