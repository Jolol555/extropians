<p><p>As you have said many times, &quot;I call them like I see them&quot;.  I
<br>
have attempted to engage you in rational dialog only to recieve
<br>
insults, ignored lines of reasoning and so on much too often in

return.  I apologize for calling you an &quot;asshole&quot; because it is
<br>
below my standards to do so.  But I do not apologize for
<br>
pointing out that you are behaving badly and certainly have
<br>
earned no right to call me to task.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Samantha and others claim that the US needs to start listening to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the world, and shaping its policy more in line with the way the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the world thinks it should be. Since Samantha opened the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument to profanity, I shall continue it with a hearty &quot;fuck that&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US did not get where it is today as the preeminent economic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military, and cultural power in the world, while concurrently having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most free society on earth, by doing things the way others thought we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should do them. We did it OUR way, the way we knew in our hearts to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best, not just for us, but for the world, and as a result, the world has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten through the age of nuclear brinksmanship in far better shape than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll bet would have occured if any other power had been in our place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ideas like individual liberty and democratic/republican values are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-eminent ideas in politics around the world today specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of us. This didn't happen by us letting others tell us how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things should be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Tell it to Allende.  What often did not act as we know is best. 
<br>
Period.  To claim otherwise in light of what has been unearthed
<br>
of CIA operations alone cannot be called anything other than
<br>
dishonest. We haven't given a rat's ass for the democratically
<br>
elected leadership of other countries in too many instances if
<br>
that leadership would not play ball with us and whatever
<br>
interests (general commercial) we supported.  Or do you think
<br>
the CIA was prohibited from being in the assasination business
<br>
in 1981 for no reason at all?  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Those around the world who want to start telling us how things should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done do so specifically because their own power is threatened by our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles and influence. They are supporting terrorism specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it is the best technique designed to date for getting large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masses of civilians to question their principles, at a cost that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller than most any other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is an outrageous claim.  Here is an alternative.  When you
<br>
are oppressed by the biggest bully around and you have no means
<br>
of fighting back on the bully's terms, some will use whatever
<br>
means they can find to strike back.  
<br>
<p>It is not our principles that we practice in our own country
<br>
that are the problem.  It is that we do not export them well and
<br>
often do not act on them when it comes to other countries.  We
<br>
must question whether our practice abroad is in keeping with
<br>
those principles you and I both admire.  I believe that in many
<br>
cases it has not been so and is not so today.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At the very least, those who want to tell us what to do do so because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are reacting against the growing influence of American culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around the world. Whether it is fast food, movies, books, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence of science and technology, the rest of the world is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bootstrapped at a far faster rate than we have experienced here in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US, and larger percents of the populations in those countries are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reacting against such bootstrapping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is some truth in this but it is far from the whole story
<br>
or even the most significant part of why the US is disliked in
<br>
so many countries.
