There was/is a transdot that may have died. Nanodot serves an overlapping
<br>
community. I'm sure there are others, but none of them are very populated.
<br>
<p>I agree that slashcode sites are a good way to bring in new people, so it
<br>
would get my vote. You'd have to be posting a lot of stuff, though -- at
<br>
least a couple new things a day to keep volume up. I don't think that's a
<br>
problem if you take the inclusive route. i.e. everything on nanodot,
<br>
everything on transdot, plus life extension stories, plus medical advance
<br>
stories, plus event notices, plus...etc. Slashcode sites die if they don't
<br>
keep a fairly high throughput or don't appeal to a wide enough audience. If
<br>
you want to grab new people into the transhumanist meme, you have to hit on
<br>
those interested in nanotech, interested in life extension, etc. Overlapping
<br>
fields.
<br>
<p>Anyhow. The best path forward if anyone was going to do this would be to bug
<br>
the owners of transdot to scavenge their setup for usefuls and relaunch with
<br>
this inclusive content, keep the posting volume up, advertise far and wide
<br>
sort of thing going on. Deals can be struck with the other more specific
<br>
slashsites that exist to crosspost material.
<br>
<p>And keep the mailing list going; just make sure it's well integrated.
<br>
Slashsites don't fully overlap the community functionality of a mailing
<br>
list.

<em>&gt; Subject: META: move from mailing lists to slashcode-based site?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know if this has already been discussed, but have people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered moving from mailing lists to a slashcode-based discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and community site format?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps keep the mailing lists in place, but also have a slashcode-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community site as well?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason I suggest this is because of the way discussion tends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to evolve on the mailing list.  People post interesting bits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;news&quot; which generates a sizable number of responses, some interesting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some not.  In the slash model, the news could be posted, and comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be posted, then moderated up or down.  This way, not everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to tread through each and every single comment ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopefully increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've set up a slashsite, and it's really not hard at all, and I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteer to do it if nobody else wants to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just a thought,
</em><br>
