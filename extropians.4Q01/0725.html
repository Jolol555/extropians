I am so stricken by this.  After I go through my communications with John, I'll pass on to this list and the cryonics list some of his thoughts that I know he would want me to share with you all.
<br>
<p>John was adamant about cryonics and shared a simpatico vision of the future.  Each time he traveled, he would send me a message letting me know where he was.  Living in New York, he attended FM-2030s memorial tribute and was one of the few people who discussed cryonics and the meaning of immortality to a group of folks who were basically in denial that FM wanted to be suspended or about the concept of transhumanity.
<br>
<p>For all the people who praised FM at that NY tribute, John was the sole-rider for superlongevity among folks who would rather hang accolades on FM’s name than support FM’s dream.
<br>
<p>later -
