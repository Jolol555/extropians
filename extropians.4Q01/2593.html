<em>&gt; Welcome to the list Jacques.  I always wondered why

</em><br>
<p><p>Thanks !
<br>
<p>Regarding the French and Extropianism, I will suggest two reasons
<br>
linked to the culture here.
<br>
<p>First, France was very much shocked by 39-45, and nazi occupation. In
<br>
the present moral confusion, typical of democracies, anti-nazism has
<br>
become about the only firm moral value. Transhumanism seems just too
<br>
close, conceptually, to no shock most of the people. In fact, even
<br>
Darwin is somehow ignored in France, partly for this reason. FOrget
<br>
about talking about &quot;socio-biology&quot; =&gt; you are a fascist.
<br>
<p>Second : Of course France has a wonderful intellectual tradition, with
<br>
free thinkers like Sade, Diderot, Voltaire, etc. Nietzsche himself was
<br>
in love with, and very inspired by French culture. But in the 20th
<br>
century, it turned into something weird, and intellectuals sort of
<br>
lose their common sense in the way. They are so obsessed at being
<br>
smarter, that they systematically neglect the obvious to focus only on
<br>
the paradoxal (which may of course be interesting, sometimes). They
<br>
seek novelty more than truth. They confuse art with thought.
<br>
<p>As to myself, I live in France (a country and a culture wich I love
<br>
and consider mine, among others), but was intellectually educated in
<br>
Geneva, which is culturally half-way between France and the
<br>
anglo-saxon tradition. My thesis professor for example was educated in
<br>
Cambridge.
<br>
<p>I have a very strong link to France because I have a very strong link
<br>
to my mother tongue (French), because I have a very strong and special
<br>
link to an art called literature. But as far as thought and science is
<br>
concerned, I appreciate the anglo-saxon tradition. (I was also raised
<br>
as a protestant, while most French are catholic, that may also explain
<br>
some of it.)
<br>
