</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The crucial bit of info you're missing is this: You can buy a liter of milk
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; me if I've got the numbers wrong--but I know they're in the ball park). You
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; under A$20,000.  And so forth.
</em><br>
<p>Bizarrely, those prices seem to me to be over double what US prices were
<br>
for the minimum in each category when I was last there (and I'm not currently
<br>
far away; I get some Seattle channels on Vancouver cable).  
<br>
<p>E.g., two years ago I was renting an apartment that cost US$350/mo.  I have
<br>
friends who have recently bought cars that were less than 10K USD before
<br>
finance charges and taxes.  I'm not sure what milk costs these days.
<br>
<p>So what you say seems to back up my intuition: that in general things should
<br>
cost twice as much in Australian dollars as they do in USD.
<br>
<p>That doesn't seem to be the conclusion that you've drawn from this, though.
