<p>there is a melbourne-based japanese researcher doing the rounds of the
<br>
pacific theatre at the moment, documenting cannibalism stories, and
<br>
apparently she was surprised to find that, while there are reports of
<br>
atrocities committed by japanese and american troops, there are no
<br>
reports of atrocities being committed by Australian troops.  I read
<br>
about a New Zealand unit massacring wounded and doctors in a german
<br>
field hospital in North Africa, but I've not heard any reports of
<br>
Australian atrocities.  Not that I've looked into this heavily, but
<br>
there you go.

<p>This is actually worse, and has grown at a faster rate over the last 10

years, in Australia.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally lifted immigration restrictions?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>If you mean the white australia policy that was lifted in the 50s
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, Australia's stance on immigration has sunk to new lows in the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years. We automatically detain refugees (sorry &quot;asylum seekers&quot;), the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ONLY country to do so. 
</em><br>
<p>Britain is moving this way, now that our reptiles have shown it can be
<br>
done and you can still win an election.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We detain many of these people in total isolation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literally, in jail, in the desert. We break international maritime law. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break UN human rights agreements that we are signatory to. We keep already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traumatised  children in jail, where they are regularly searched, subjected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to roll calls at all hours, &amp; where they witness the more desperate refugees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self harm themselves (some have seen self immolation, hangings and the good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old wrist slash). 
</em><br>
<p>The self immolation was done outside the detention centres, by someone
<br>
who was free to wander around the country but couldn't get his daughter
<br>
in because she had a birth defect. I know someone who moved here with
<br>
his wife, was about to become a citizen and he gave birth to a daughter
<br>
with mild down's syndrome.
<br>
<p>boing, rejected, back to Italy.
<br>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, his daughter was born here, she is a citizen,
<br>
but not according to the government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Words cannot express the sheer disgust I feel for my country, and my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government at the moment. The Australian public has been consistently lied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to by it's government &amp; manipulated by the basest of emotions: fear. I love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my country, but now...I'm just so ashamed.
</em><br>
<p>Eh, blame the govt, public opinion is firmly behind the refugees
