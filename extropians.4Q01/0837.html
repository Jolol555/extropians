<p>I didn't say that my horizons stopped at 2008.  What I did say is that you
<br>
should *practice*.  If you genuinely can't think of anything you can do in
<br>
a 6-year timeframe, that's okay too.  It may mean that humanity is doomed,
<br>
but if that's your prediction, then so be it.
<br>
<p>Pretend that you have little or no time to set up initial conditions. 
<br>
Pretend that every month you use to set up initial conditions comes out of
<br>
a limited budget.  Pretend that you are limited to working with what's
<br>
already in place, because that's exactly what you may have to do.
<br>
<p>Six years is only an incredibly short time if you're used to thinking of
<br>
having fifty years to twiddle around.  Six years is actually quite a long
<br>
time in absolute terms.  A lot can happen in six years.
<br>
<p>And you can form a sufficiently large group out of quite a small fraction
<br>
of the available population, when you live on a planet with six billion
<br>
occupants.
<br>
<p>If it does take a lot of time to set up the initial conditions, and there
<br>
just isn't that much time available... then you fail.  This is always a
<br>
possibility.
<br>
<p>Shortsightedness or farsightedness is a question of being willing to think
<br>
strategically.  People do not create the problems of the world by
<br>
*choosing* to focus on the short-term; people create problems by being
<br>
*unable* to think more than a few years ahead, or by being unwilling to
<br>
visualize the consequences of their actions.
<br>
<p>I am capable of imagining, and planning for, scenarios where the
<br>
Singularity occurs in 2008.  I can plan for a scenario in which the
<br>
Singularity occurs in 2020.  Even though it's very improbable, I can still
<br>
visualize the consequences of the Singularity being delayed until 2030, or
<br>
2040.  I can ask myself questions about what happens if a sentient mind
<br>
lives for a trillion subjective years, even though we have inadequate
<br>
information to make real guesses, because I think it's important to have
<br>
*a* visualization of post-Singularity existence, even if it's not the
<br>
right one.  I know that it's a long, long way to Alpha Centauri if your
<br>
neural substrate runs a million times faster.
<br>
<p>Having the right perspective is a matter of being in sync with the flow of
<br>
time, as it exists in your generation.  You can't fake it through
<br>
exhortations to &quot;take the long view&quot;.  Building a clock that chimes once a
<br>
century is not taking the long view; it is Singularity denial.  Taking the
<br>
long view means being willing to deal with Singularities... or anything
<br>
else that pops up.
<br>
<p>If Stewart Brand wants to create something eternal and make a contribution
<br>
to the future, then he needs to think about the Singularity, and
<br>
humanity's future stretching off into millions of years, and trillions of
<br>
years, and googleplexes and knuthillions of years, and eternity... and
<br>
about the fact that, in all that foreverness, *we* who live today are the
<br>
only six billion entities to predate the Singularity itself.  This moment
<br>
is absolutely unique - dangerous, but also unique.  Is the only gift we
<br>
can give to future generations that of a great big clock?  Even protons
<br>
only last 10^31 years.
<br>
<p>I think about eternity because I plan on creating something eternal.  I
<br>
also accept that I may be required to finish creating it by 2008.  That's
<br>
life.
