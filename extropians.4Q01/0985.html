<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;Then tell me exactly why we are talking about an indeterminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;war against an unknown number of targets in an unknown number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;countries.  Such a war should be shouted down immediately.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it isn't.  Why?  As bad as 911 was such a response is overboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and overly broad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Al Queda is a worldwide network of terrorist organizations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating out of over 60 countries at last count. We will need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismantle the entire network.
</em><br>
<p>When dismantling anything, it is useful to look for contributing
<br>
causes of what one would like to see go away or at least be
<br>
rendered powerless.  Yet I have seen almost no signs that the US
<br>
is willing to admit to the abusees that have led in part to the
<br>
atmosphere under which various forms of extremism flourish in
<br>
the Middle East.  
<br>
<p>Assuming for a moment that the above figures are true (which I
<br>
have
<br>
not seen the evidence for), is it the plan to pressure and if
<br>
necessary attack up to 60 countries looking for this network
<br>
that is supposedly (for the sake of argument) the source of all
<br>
ills?  If so then this cure seems to me at least as dangerous
<br>
and costly in lives as the disease.  
<br>
<p><p>We could not even defeat the Vietcong and yet we plan to find
<br>
and remove such a supposed widespread and in places popular
<br>
network in 60 countries?  This seems a highly dubious and
<br>
dangerous proposal.  We want to dismantle all terror networks? 
<br>
Good.  Be sure to insure our own terror network, the CIA.  Do
<br>
you think I have no justification for that statement?  I suggest
<br>
you take a trip down memory lane of some of the publicized
<br>
things the CIA has done supposedly in our name.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think we are on completely the right track at the moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you think we are on the right track to give effectively carte
<br>
blanche to the government to rifle through all of our lives at
<br>
will and to fight an inderterminately long and hazardous ware
<br>
against an indeterminate number of targets regardless of any and
<br>
all costs?
<br>
<p>I don't - not for a second. 
<br>
<p>I also think we are lying in that we are not admitting where we
<br>
contribute to terror directly and indirectly.  As long as we
<br>
don't address the problems with our own foreign policy then
<br>
claims that we are doing everything necessary for the safety and
<br>
well-being of ourselves and reasonable people everywhere are
<br>
rather empty.  I think we are being extremely two-faced when we
<br>
let Israel get away with literal murder and assasinations in
<br>
broad daylight, even using weapons we gave them, and say almost
<br>
nothing.  Yet let any Palestinian hit back in any form and we
<br>
are all over the PLO.  I think we are dishonest and/or heartless
<br>
when we say that the 600,000 children that have died in Iraq as
<br>
the result of our bombing and blockades are reasonable
<br>
collateral damage.  If I was Arab, even a very secular Arab, I
<br>
would be extremely unhappy with the US on many counts.  Yet we
<br>
often act as if only a bunch of crazed fanatics really are upset
<br>
with us and that no reasonable persons in the region have any
<br>
real complain.  Our President has the nerve to claim as much on
<br>
national TV.  
<br>
<p>I love this country with all my heart.  But it sickens me to
<br>
watch some of what we are doing now and some of the postures we
<br>
are assuming.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Laugh if you want to but it is a much more complicated world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;than blase assumptions that we are the good guys and those are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the &quot;evil ones&quot; would lead you to believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree completely that the world is much more complicated than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blase assumption. For example the terrorist organization known as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Al Queda is much more sophisticated than you give them credit for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And we or rather some of our agencies that have run amok and now
<br>
are being handed even greater powers over both ourselves and the
<br>
rest of the world with even less oversight, are much more in the
<br>
wrong ourselves than I see most people in the US admitting to. 
<br>
I don't know all sophisticated Al Qaeda is or is not and I
<br>
suspect, neither does anyone here.  But our know our own CIA has
<br>
been active for good and often ill all over the globe for many
<br>
decades and has sources of funding that are nearly untraceable. 
<br>
And I know it is ultra-sophiticated. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We do not know there is any terrorism plot behind the anthrax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;scare according to experts.  Nor do we have evidence saying it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is done by any particular group that is more than extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;flimsy.  That the Taliban are nasty folks does not say they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;responsible for all ills nor that an endless campaign that goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;substantially beyond Afghanistan is in the least justified.  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to mention the eviscerating of our own civil liberties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that we do not know enough about the anthrax episode to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draw any conclusions yet, at least publicly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I have already explained the need for worldwide anti-terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm gratified to see that some of the new emergency laws being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed have sunset provisions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would be more gratified if we spent as long considering the
<br>
implications and dangerous of these new laws and the
<br>
cost-benefit ratio of them as we spent pouring over the sex life
<br>
of Clinton.  Personally I think our civil liberties and
<br>
guarantees of freedom at home are worth at least that much.  I
<br>
don't see that very much gain in detecting and stopping
<br>
terrorist actions will be acheived as against the very real and
<br>
deep eroding of our liberty and safety from tyranny.  
<br>
<p>I don't expect the sunset provisions to ever be agreed to by
<br>
Bush.  If they are I don't expect him to be through with this
<br>
indeterminate holy war when the sunset clause is up.
