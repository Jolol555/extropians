There are two big families of argument here, at least as I see it.
<br>
(1)'Moratoriumists' believe that we do not have the wisdom at our current
<br>
stage of cultural development to use Person Engineering Technologies (PETs),
<br>
but leave open the possibility that in the longer-term this might be
<br>
ethically ok. (3)'Principlists' believe that it is wrong always and every
<br>
where to use PETs. The religious generally fall in  the latter category. An
<br>
example of a Moratoriumist is D. Hoftstadter who argues against the
<br>
implementation of at least one PET, namely Superintelligent AI, in a
<br>
forthcoming paper &quot;Moore's Law, Artificial Evolution, and the Fate of
<br>
Humanity&quot;. He argues that maybe 300 years or so might be necessary to allow
<br>
humanity enough time to get used to the idea of being made obsolete. I saw a
<br>
somewhat encouraging survey reported on one of the CNN channels today that
<br>
said (I think--I haven't checked these figures) that 6% of Americans thought
<br>
that cloning was ok but this rose to somewhere around 30 % when asked if it
<br>
was ok to use cloning technology for therapeutic purposes. I wonder how many
<br>
think that it is just too early to use the technology. One of the things we
<br>
should do is try to develop a very nuanced understanding of exactly what it
<br>
is that the majority objects to and why. For example, Hoftstadter's argument
<br>
is definitely not the one that Robert describes.
