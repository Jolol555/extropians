</em><br>
<p>Ah well, by a stroke of luck I discuss this wonderful book a bit in READING
<br>
BY STARLIGHT, thus:
<br>
<p>=========
<br>
<p>...there is no doubt that some contemporary sf is at least as well-wrought
<br>
as its high-toned mainstream cousins, and better than any sf from the past.
<br>
The following paragraphs from recent novels confirm it: they sing, and
<br>
beautifully. The first is from John Crowley's Aegypt, perhaps closer to
<br>
magical fantasy (but not magical realism) than to science fiction:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were angels in the glass, two four six many of them, each one
<br>
shuffling into his place like an alderman at the Lord Mayor's show. None
<br>
was dressed in white; some wore fillets or wreaths of flowers and green
<br>
leaves in their loose hair; all their eyes were strangely gay. They kept
<br>
pressing in by one and two, always room for more, they linked arms or
<br>
clasped their hands behind them, they looked out smiling at the two mortals
<br>
who looked in at them. All their names began with A. 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is the rapturous reworking of Dante that closes Geoff Ryman's
<br>
novel of genetic engineering, The Child Garden.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her separate selves were freed: the infant and the child, the orphan
<br>
in the Child Garden, the actress and the director, the wife and the
<br>
People's Artist, Milena the Angel, Milena the oncogene, Milena who carried
<br>
the mind of Heather, and the Milena who remembered Rolfa.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rose up like the white pages of a written speech thrown to the
<br>
winds. The pages blew like leaves, were scattered to their individual and
<br>
eternal Nows. The Nows were no longer linked by time or by a self. They
<br>
went beyond time, to where the whole truth can be told. It takes forever to
<br>
tell the truth, and it is bound into one volume by love. That is the third
<br>
book, beyond words or low imagining. 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Child Garden posits a future Britain governed by the worst excesses of
<br>
reductive science and idealist ideology masquerading as materialism. Like
<br>
most fashionable postmodern novels it is also a text about the creative
<br>
process of reading. Its sustained inventions are often metaphors that seem
<br>
drawn directly from current high literary theory, as Umberto Eco's are, and
<br>
like Eco's are, happily, steeped as well in traditional learning and
<br>
story-telling.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is above all an impressive reconstruction of Dante Alighieri's
<br>
journey, 700 years ago, from the Inferno through Purgatory to a
<br>
transcendental and beatific vision. Quite literally, it proposes (and
<br>
embodies) The Divine Comedy as a 21st century Wagner might conceive it in a
<br>
Bayreuth as large and inescapable as the polluted sky.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milena, amnesiac refugee to British purgatory from Czechoslovakian hell,
<br>
halfway through her truncated life, is a prim, sour Tenniel Alice who
<br>
commits Dante's own sin - she forgets her (lesbian) Beatrice, a wild woman
<br>
composer named Rolfa Patel, Genetically Engineered for life in the
<br>
Antarctic to the form of a great polar bear.  By the standards of the
<br>
ruling Party, Milena's sin and crime is to love Rolfa in the first place.
<br>
`This was a semiological product of late period capitalism. Milena
<br>
suffered, apparently, from Bad Grammar' (p. 2). Her story is a
<br>
Bildungsroman, taking Milena from cramped repression to insight,
<br>
redemption, indeed sainthood. It is funny while genuinely moving, teemingly
<br>
fecund, baroque yet cleanly and beautifully written.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtitled `A Low Comedy', it is that and much more. Ideas tumble about the
<br>
page like performing animals, like human infected by diseases of
<br>
information. Most of its characters are educated/indoctrinated by designer
<br>
viruses, and get their sustenance straight from sunlight through their
<br>
rich, mutated purple skin. What is more, nearly everyone dies by 35, a
<br>
side-effect of the contagious cure for cancer. Retarded children,
<br>
preternaturally learned via their viruses, drolly debate Derrida. `&quot;Now
<br>
what is Derrida really talking about in his article on Plato?&quot; &quot;Writing!&quot;
<br>
chorused the Lumps. Then, washed by the same viruses, they remembered other
<br>
answers' (p. 178). If Rolfa is Milena's Beatrice, the viruses (especially
<br>
one that encodes the persona of dead Heather, who reads all Marx's works to
<br>
the child and cannot be shut off) are her collective Virgil. Ryman's book
<br>
comes very close to being the long-awaited work that successfully bonds the
<br>
force and aspirations of both literature and sf.
