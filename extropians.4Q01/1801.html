<em>&gt;&gt; Freeloading may increase total unfairness, but it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; increases wealth. Downloading always increases wealth.
</em><br>
<p>I must confess that I haven't thought out the following notion in detail,
<br>
and don't understand enough about the Napster culture to guess if it would
<br>
work. Still--
<br>
<p>Suppose I e-posted advertisements (somehow/somewhere) that my latest novel
<br>
can be downloaded free from one given server, and asked for a $1 or less
<br>
tip. Terrible idea: I need to pay for server space, and the inundation of
<br>
hits from my zillion eager fans will lock up the system and send them to
<br>
Piers Anthony paperbacks instead. 
<br>
<p>So what if, instead, I use a sort of benign pyramid scheme:
<br>
<p>I send Eliezer, Spike and Robert an attached e-copy of the 85,000 word
<br>
novel apiece (after politely inviting and receiving their request for it). 
<br>
<p>Thereafter they can do what they wish with it, but I ask nicely that if
<br>
they enjoy the book they send me a buck (by whatever appropriate means,
<br>
maybe Paypal) AND THAT THEY SEND A TEASER TO ANOTHER THREE FRIENDS who they
<br>
judge might care to read it. 
<br>
<p>If those gullible marks in turn accept a download, out it goes--at modest
<br>
expense and effort to Eliezer, Spike and Robert, whose job is then done.
<br>
Then those cats in turn send me a buck (should they care to accept this
<br>
mission, and find the thing an enjoyable read), and so on in a snowball
<br>
that makes me rich within 20 iterations and gives many people an enjoyable
<br>
experience (I have to tell you, the new novel ENDLESS is a lot of fun).
<br>
<p>Has this idea got legs?
<br>
<p>Or is it very, very boring and/or already the basis of MPEGs anyway/etc?
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick
