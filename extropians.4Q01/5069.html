<p><em>&gt; Similar trends apply to the UK as well.  As has been mentioned in the past,

<em>&gt; at the beginning of the 20th century when guns were totally unregulated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the UK, the murder rate was substantially lower than it was at the end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 20th century when handguns were basically outlawed.  The same goes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall violent crime rates.
</em><br>
<p>Not quite right; I think you need to put these statements in a lot of
<br>
context to interpret them correctly. Some of the relevant statistics are at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-111.pdf">http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-111.pdf</a> (section 6)
<br>
<p>Although the UK homicide rate has indeed risen from 9.6/million in 1900 to
<br>
14.1/million in 1997, this is in the context of a much greater rise in all
<br>
crime, from 2.4/thousand to 89.1/thousand. If you look at the statistics,
<br>
you will see that most of the rise in these rates has taken place since
<br>
1970. So homicide rates as a proportion of all crime has fallen.
<br>
<p>Context: firearms play a miniscule role in UK homicides. In recent years the
<br>
*absolute numbers* (compare with a typical US city) of handgun homicides
<br>
have fluctuated from a low of 7 (in 1988) to a high of 42 (in 1999) - source
<br>
for this is <a href="http://www.gun-control-network.org/CrimStats0101.htm">http://www.gun-control-network.org/CrimStats0101.htm</a>. That's for
<br>
the whole country. So if we assume the UK population is ~60 million, in the
<br>
late 90s there were about 850 homicides in the UK per annum, with between 7
<br>
and 42 being related to firearms.  In other words between 0.8-5.0% of all
<br>
homicides in the UK are related to the use of guns. Guns were used in only
<br>
4.7% of UK robberies in 1999, so don't play a very big role in non-homicide
<br>
violent crime either.
<br>
<p>Conclusions:
<br>
<p>1. Guns are outlawed (or severely restricted) in the UK
<br>
2. Guns do not make any significant contribution to homicide in the UK
<br>
3. Guns do not play any significant role in violent crime in the UK
<br>
4. Although overall murder rate has risen over 100 years, this is vastly
<br>
outstripped by a rise in all crime, and is not accompanied by any specific
<br>
rise in the murder rate attributable to guns.
<br>
<p>In short, I think your implicit argument that controlling guns (in the UK)
<br>
is unrelated to the use of guns for murder is completely incorrect.
<br>
Observationally, guns are outlawed in the UK and the homicide rate
<br>
attributable to guns is very small. Of course, this doesn't mean there is a
<br>
causal connection; but it's certainly an interesting observation!
<br>
<p>Technically, you are of course correct that in the UK total homicide rate
<br>
and gun control are uncorrelated, but this is for the completely trivial
<br>
reason that over 95% of homicides in the UK do not involve guns.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It should also be noted that virtually all of the concentrations of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime in the US occur in locales where firearms have been banned or severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restricted.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting - can you provide more details? I wasn't aware that there are
<br>
specific locations in the US where firearms are banned? Are you talking
<br>
about neighborhoods, states, cities, what?
