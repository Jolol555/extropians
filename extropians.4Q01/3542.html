From: &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20neo-luddites%20are%20&quot;US%20Taliban&quot;%20%20(was%20Re:%20&quot;Cloning%20Breakthrough&quot;%20not%20one)&In-Reply-To=&lt;001801c178fa$dd0f2940$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; The notion of thwarting attempts to escape justice via suicide is new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.  What would you do if you restored a suicide bomber from a backup?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There wouldn't be much point in giving him the death penalty.  So what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the idea, would you torture him?  That doesn't seem very enlightened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The article does not seem to carry through with its own logic. If everyone
<br>
has a back-up then the &quot;suicide&quot; bomber would presumably not be guilty of
<br>
murder, but only of property damage. In a world with back-ups and nano to
<br>
fix the damage at the WTC, bin Laden-type terrorists might receive only a
<br>
100 hours of community service for slightly inconveniencing a number of
<br>
people. In response to your general point, I think there would be a
<br>
temptation to restore earlier versions of criminals to give them a second
<br>
chance. (It can't be that they are evil by nature, so the thinking goes, we
<br>
as a society (or species) must have failed them so how).
