<p>My former boss, Don Sakamoto, was detained during the war.
<br>
He had an interesting take on this.  His father came to Taxifornia in
<br>
1910, made a few dollars, sent for a mail order bride from his home
<br>
town, Osaka.  They had 12 children.  Don was the youngest.  The
<br>
family owned a farm adjacent to what is now the site of SR237, the
<br>
longest parking lot in Taxifornia.  Don's job was to fetch water, hold
<br>
the lanterns, etc, so the older brothers could work the farm after
<br>
school and their other day jobs.  He earned 25 cents a day.
<br>
<p>When the war came, the entire family was ordered into an internment
<br>
camp, with the exception of the oldest two sons, who served the army
<br>
with distinction in Europe.  Don's parents assumed they would all be
<br>
slain.  They burned most of their possessions, none of which amounted
<br>
to much, with the exception of a ceremonial bamboo Samurai costume
<br>
and sword, which Don's grandfather bought in Osaka in 1860 for the
<br>
equivalent of 800 US dollars.  (Hard telling what these would be
<br>
worth today).
<br>
<p>They were taken to a camp in Arkansas.  Don's parents were
<br>
surprised that they were actually fed, quite adequately, and their
<br>
medical needs were well tended.  Don observed that even as a
<br>
seven year old child, he recognized that the family's standard of
<br>
living in the camp was at least as good as it was back home
<br>
before the war.  They were further surprised that the Arkansas
<br>
locals harbored no ill will toward the detainees.  Don and his
<br>
friends would routinely sneak out of the camp to fish in the local
<br>
streams.  No one became upset over this.  Evidently the locals
<br>
had suffered from a very poor economy before the war.  The
<br>
camp brought in money along with the Japanese guests.
<br>
<p>Whenever Don told stories of his childhood in the detention
<br>
camp, he always got a little smile on his face, remembering
<br>
the experience with fondness.  Before the camp all he could
<br>
recall is hard work, school, hard work, sleep, etc.  In the
<br>
camp he was given the chance to play with the other kids,
<br>
and have a carefree childhood, even if under unusual
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p>After the war, detainees were told that they needed a sponsor in
<br>
order to return to Taxifornia, but an agent contacted the Sakamoto
<br>
family and told them that rule didn't apply to them, since they were
<br>
owners of property.  That also surprised them, since they had not
<br>
been able to pay the property taxes during their internment and had
<br>
assumed the government or the locals had taken everything.  But
<br>
they were given train tickets back, and found their farm fallow but
<br>
intact and their home just as they had left it (with the charred remains
<br>
of the Samurai costume in the back yard).  Nothing was missing from
<br>
the house, no evidence of any forced entry.  They were told they
<br>
still owed the back taxes to the state (remember this is Taxifornia),
<br>
but were given time to produce a crop and pay it off, which they
<br>
did.  {Don tells of being disappointed to learn that the family still
<br>
owned that damned farm.}  Don's father was quite surprised at
<br>
how well his family was treated during the war.  When his eldest
<br>
two sons returned from Europe, the town gave them a hero's
<br>
welcome.
<br>
<p>Don went to Fremont High School, and then to San Jose State U,
<br>
became an aerospace engineer, and worked his way up thru the
<br>
ranks to manager.  Two of his friends from those days who had
<br>
similar experiences were Sam Araki, who made it to VP of
<br>
Lockheed, and Norm Mineta, former mayor of San Jose currently
<br>
serving as the US Secretary of Transportation.  The property that
<br>
was once the Sakamoto farm is still in the family, and today, altho
<br>
still undeveloped, it is worth a cool fortune.
<br>
<p>I am a volunteer noodle cooker at the local Buddhist Oban
<br>
festival nearly ever summer.  Three years ago, both Araki and
<br>
Mineta showed up, and both treated SakamotoSan like a long
<br>
lost brother.
<br>
<p>Don expired last spring, but not before both he and his wife
<br>
received generous checks from the US government for having
<br>
detained them during the war, considering that being elementary
<br>
school aged children, their lost wages would be only a few dollars.
