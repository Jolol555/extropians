<em>&gt; 	Is it fiction or science which is holistic rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reductive? Science, we guess at first, is surely the very paradigm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the reductive, stripping the meat and fat from the bone, boiling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down the flensed carcase into a skeletal substrate, all sumptuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life reduced to numbers. But that's true also of the mechanics of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction, as narratologists show us: every imagined action, in folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story and Tolstoy alike, derives from a handful or two of types,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions, actants, deployed in words built from an equally small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of distinguishable acoustic or graphic segments.
</em><br>
<p><p>There is a lapse in your argument : you compare what science aims at
<br>
to what fiction IS, as analyzed by narratology, the science of
<br>
fiction.
<br>
<p>The way I see the most important distinction between science and art
<br>
is this : what science aims at is truth ; and truth, in its unchanging
<br>
character, has nothing to do with us, living things. It may be nice to
<br>
know, and useful ; or it may be depressing (when people first realized
<br>
they were mortal) ; or it may be indifferent. It doesn't care about
<br>
us. Once discovered, it's there to stay. Contemplating it will cheer
<br>
you up one day ; then make you sad the next day. You will change, but
<br>
it won't. It doesn't care about you.
<br>
<p>On the contrary art is made for us. By nature it is &quot;on our side&quot;, on
<br>
life's side.
<br>
<p>And it is so even when it aims beyond &quot;the imitation of life&quot;. You can
<br>
be made for the living beings without representing life (think of a
<br>
very &quot;abstract&quot; piece by Bach) -- as you can represent life without
<br>
designing the representation for living beings (think biology).
<br>
<p>So the two activities are really different because of what they aim
<br>
at. But as activities they have many similarities, as both are
<br>
creative, and searching for truth can be a very lively and passionate
<br>
thing.
