<p>Natasha posted an article here on October 10 by Stephen Schwartz writing
<br>
in the American Spectator about Wahhabism and its attraction to poor
<br>
Muslims.  (The article had also been posted September 23 by JR.  I haven't
<br>
found it at the Spectator website, which seems to be largely shut down.)
<br>
<p>I thought the following claim by Schwartz was astonishing:
<br>
<p>: The same influences are brought to bear throughout the 10-million-strong
<br>
: Muslim community in America, as well as those in Europe. In the US, 80 per
<br>
: cent of mosques are estimated by the Sufi Hisham al-Kabbani, born in Lebanon
<br>
: and now living in the US, to be under the control of Wahhabi imams, who
<br>
: preach extremism
<br>
<p>If 80% of United States mosques are Wahhabi, this is not a movement which
<br>
is remote and foreign.  We can learn more about it just by visiting a
<br>
local mosque or Moslem cultural center.
<br>
<p>There have been a number of ecumenical gatherings meant to bring together
<br>
people from different cultures, Arab Americans and local Muslims along
<br>
with mainstream Jews and Christians.  I would love to attend one of these
<br>
and ask the question about the influence of Wahhab.  Is it true that
<br>
this movement is synonymous with violent anti-Americanism, as Schwartz
<br>
makes it out to be?  Why would Muslims living in the United States,
<br>
many of whom are middle class or above and who aren't grubbing a living
<br>
in the mean streets of Cairo, find such a religious movement attractive?
<br>
<p>To me, this doesn't add up.  I don't know how credible Schwartz is on
<br>
this issue (again, a problem with reposting material from elsewhere
<br>
without analysis or comment).  Either Wahhabism is not as closely tied
<br>
to violence as is claimed, or it is not so widespread in the U.S.
<br>
The alternative is that 80% of U.S. mosques are fifth columns where
<br>
terrorists hide waiting for their chance to strike, which is absurd.
