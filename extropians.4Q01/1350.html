</em><br>
<em>&gt; The design cost may or may not be significant.  It depends

</em><br>
<p>True...once we have self-replicating nanorobots.  If we had them, it
<br>
would be a perfectly valid strategy to send one or a few to an
<br>
asteroid, then construct the means to slow it down out of the
<br>
asteroid's non-valuable mass.  Only problem is: we don't have them yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Space development *can* piggyback very easily on developments

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>True.  But we don't have self-replicating MEMSbots either, yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Which will be years, probably at least a century or two, later for most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such rocks. Humans usually aren't that patient. This may change in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I'm talking about strategy to get space colonized *within* a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have to be assuming that nanotech development fails completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe that we will not be in space in a robust way within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next 50 years.  I myself would place bets on the expansion occuring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the 2020-2030 time frame.
</em><br>
<p>Mmm hmm.  And I'm outlining a way to realize that, without having to
<br>
gamble on technology not yet developed.  (Self-replicating nanotech
<br>
easily leads to space, but there's ways to space even if SRN fails.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Right now? $0, or close enough to make no difference. I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kidding: NASA might well, say, boost its discarded shuttle fuel tanks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into orbit if someone where to pay it enough; design studies have even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been done on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That simply isn't true.  It looks to me like habitat space is worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something in the vicinity of $10-20 million per week (once the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development costs are &quot;sunk&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>So, who pays the development costs?  They'll easily outstrip $10-20
<br>
million per week amortized over anything short of a decade, and there
<br>
aren't any commercial places willing to put up that much money for
<br>
non-proven markets.  (Governments might be able to, but their funding
<br>
is subject to political whims: rely on government funding, and you roll
<br>
the dice each year to see if your project still exists.  The result is
<br>
something about as effective as post-Challenger NASA...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Asteroid mining, *if one delivers the minerals to Earth to sell them*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is one such activity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think so.  To get them to Earth reliably, without vaporizing most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your payload, you have to have controlled deceleration -- or sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing capability in space that the heat shield that you vaporize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is made out of relatively worthless material.  So you have to lift into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit (a) fuel for deceleration; or (b) heat shield manufacturing capacity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never seen anything (and I've read a fair amount of literature on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the topic) that suggests that the calculations for this have been done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and can in fact produce a net profit.
</em><br>
<p>Crude positioning can put the reject slag into heat shield position, so
<br>
(b) doesn't seem too difficult.  Alternately, for (a), fuel for
<br>
deceleration could be mined from the asteroid itself (for some
<br>
asteroids).  And there may be a third way: beamed energy launches have
<br>
been demonstrated, at least in prototype, but in reverse, they can
<br>
decelerate a payload that's dropping towards them.
