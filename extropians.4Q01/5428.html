From: Michael Wiik [mailto:<a href="mailto:mwiik@messagenet.com?Subject=RE:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;EB5DDEEFC7B4D411AD3B00508BDFF3E202319150@1upmc-msx7.isdip.upmc.edu&gt;">mwiik@messagenet.com</a>]
<br>
<p>I know how you feel. That's why I'd prefer to carry a nuke, set to go
<br>
off if I die (or perhaps under a variety of conditions). Like the guy in
<br>
Snowcrash (think it was the guy with 'Poor Self Control' tattoed on his
<br>
forehead). This way I hope to incentivise others to keep me safe.
<br>
<p><p>### Actually, should I encounter a person with a nuke wired to his head, I
<br>
would consider it a civic duty to kill him (by a remote drone, preferably
<br>
after sedating him, then transporting to an unpopulated area) - in this way
<br>
I would save lots of innocent lives by preventing his nuke from accidental
<br>
or planned in-city explosion.
<br>
<p>Then I would kill everybody involved in the procurement of the nuke,
<br>
including the electrophysiologist who made the EEG-detonator setup. Then I
<br>
widely publicize my willingness and ability to continue such actions as
<br>
needed. In this way I would save even more innocent lives.
<br>
<p>I could get pretty bloodthirsty with a guy waving a nuke in my face.
