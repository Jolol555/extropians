<em>&gt; These feelings have some good reasons (some of the interventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentionned here these days, etc.), and some bad reasons (false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representations, jealousy, blaming your misfortunes on someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and escaping your responsability, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the resentment is bad, not (only) because it is so sad for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US to be misunderstood, but because it allows leaders in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries to bring their countries in destructive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auto-destructive directions.
</em><br>
<p>for sure europe is against :
<br>
1)restrictions in freedom - especially internet freedom, freedom of speech, and cognitive freedom
<br>
america is totalitarian country, so it is not strange that EU contries help afghanistan  - US have their enemy,
<br>
and gives time for EU - they can arm, they can watch us spies in EU more carefully.
<br>
<p>i live in poland, where american WOD just began.. i is interesting that ppl not want any WOD.
<br>
they try to minimise costs of such war, they boicotted the elections this year,
<br>
anarchy is on rise now.
<br>
and - yes - many blame USA for this - especiallty Wolrd Trade Center organisation.
<br>
<p>so i think whole world is against USA, after discovering neurochemistry which makes WOD just a economical
<br>
task. USA imprisoned so many INTELLIGENT NONVIOLENT ppl while doing WOD that the WW3 will end when
<br>
goverement of USA will be directed to PSYCHIATRIC WARD - diagnosis? paranoid schizophrenia.
