</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deafness of the major media (who effectively ignored the Timor atrocities,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Which is what John's cite from Jeff says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is still his problem of equating tens of thousands of deaths to millions of them, as if one Timorese death is worth a hundred Cambodian demises, which he does when he argues that it is unjustifiable that one atrocity received more media attention 
</em><br>
than another.
<br>
<p>This is specifically a problem of how you look at society. Chomsky and
<br>
his anarcho-lefties look at society as one unit, thus an atrocity is an
<br>
atrocity is an atrocity, no matter how many individuals were involved.
<br>
To them, the individual is not as important as the group, so saying that
<br>
one death here is equal to one hundred there has no meaning for them.
<br>
<p>Part of this is because of the difficulty in executing thousands of
<br>
sentences on one perpetrator of an atrocity in court. How, for instance,
<br>
do you impose a thousand death sentences on one person? Or a thousand
<br>
life sentences? At best, in the current day, a person can do two to four
<br>
life sentences before they die, so any more than that is a bit of
<br>
overkill. Thus, mass crimes tend to be treated as one whole crime, and
<br>
the  punishment for each individual death is thus discounted as the
<br>
death toll rises. After you've killed ten, what harm is there in
<br>
whacking a few more, you aren't gonna be punished any MORE for doing so.
<br>
<p>Back in the middle ages in Scotland and elsewhere, a person could be
<br>
tried and sentenced after their own death. In many cases, the corpse was
<br>
brought into court and stood up in the docket in their casket to face
<br>
the judge and jury... all without modern air conditioning...
<br>
<p>Unless, of course, we gain immortality. Imagine keeping a Hitler or
<br>
Stalin (or bin Laden) alive for hundreds or even thousands of years
<br>
purposely to keep him in prison, doing hard labor, for the thousands or
<br>
more people they've killed. Perhaps even upload the minds of such
<br>
criminals so that they can undergo eons of punishment in virtual
<br>
reality. By this count, bin Laden would get 6,000 x 20 years, or 180,000
<br>
years of incarceration for his crime. Hitler would get somewhere between
<br>
300 million and a billion years of hard time. Sounds rather like the
<br>
mythological hell, doesn't it?
<br>
<p>Yet to do less is to most certainly devalue the individuals who died in
<br>
such atrocities. Many top Nazis got sentences ranging from 6-20 years,
<br>
which puts the value of the people they killed at mere seconds of
<br>
punishment for each death. The law today says that in such cases, the
<br>
offenders serve their sentences 'concurrently', yet that is to, once
<br>
again, apply standards of group crimes and group rights when none such
<br>
exist.
