<p>This is a very common response from such agencies, because they
<br>
know that if they ever say anything different, then healthcare
<br>
expenses will skyrocket. It is not the only reason (aging is
<br>
&quot;natural&quot;, the definition of disease is nontrivial), but it is part
<br>
of the reason.

<p><em>&gt; He proposes the &quot;volitional normative&quot; model as a way out

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>We might want a better term than &quot;disease&quot;, like &quot;unwanted
<br>
condition&quot; or something like this. What I think you are aiming at
<br>
in this example is that you do not consider the blocker's desire to
<br>
be anything we others have a moral obligation to support. I would
<br>
say that he has his morphological freedom - he has a right to
<br>
change his body if he so desires - but this is a negative freedom
<br>
(we have no right to stop him from doing it) and he can demand our
<br>
active support. This is of course even more of an issue in
<br>
countries like Sweden where most healthcare is nationalized. 
<br>
<p>Probably the best way of implementing this is to have a baseline
<br>
health that you get, and anything above it is up to you to pay for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want to *really* grab the bull by the horns consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this -- the &quot;gold standard&quot; for scientific &quot;proof&quot; of efficacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a double blind random trial.  So, Company X has a treatment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that retards or better still completely prevents aging.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run an clinical trial according to the &quot;gold standard&quot;.  You look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the results.  If your treatment is successful, all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people receiving it are still alive.  All the people not receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it are dead.  If the treatment *really* prevents aging then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was presumably highly immoral (not that I think I know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that word means anymore...) to even run the trial.
</em><br>
<p>This happens already in drug trials, where they have to end them
<br>
earlier because they feel it is unethical to withold a clearly
<br>
better treatment. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps I'll give Laura a call next week and see if she can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell me which of the 8 disease concepts the FDA subscribes to.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a good idea. I would love to know.
