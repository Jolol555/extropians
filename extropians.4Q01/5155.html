<p>Ahem.  And this is where attribution becomes important.  I *quoted*
<br>
that line; I did not write it myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, I was more wondering why the US wouldn't sign a treaty banning the more primitive landmines.  I mean, if the US believes it is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Those lines, OTOH, I did write.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (end)

<em>&gt; The U.S. is opposed to a world ban on landmines due to the situation with the Korean demiliterized zone.  The landmines there would really slow down a massive North Korean advance, thereby saving many thousands of American and South Korean lives.  I wish the Korean situation would fizzle out so a ban could be ratified by the United States.
</em><br>
<p>You misread what I wrote.  I acknowledge that the US wishes to maintain
<br>
using *its* mines; the Korean minefield is one of its justifications.
<br>
What I was wondering was, if it believes it can responsibly use mines
<br>
due to technical safety features and the like, but much of the rest of
<br>
the world wants to ban landmines due to bad use of mines without those
<br>
safety features and is miffed at the US for refusing to play along, then
<br>
why not simply ban mines without the safety features?
