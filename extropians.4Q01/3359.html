<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Rational Decisions Guided by Emotion - Study
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I can't agree with the conclusions of these researchers (as
<br>
presented in this article).  Their research did NOT show that emotions are
<br>
used in making logical decisions.  It seemed to show the opposite.  What am
<br>
I missing?
<br>
<p>The so-called logical decisions were those which would affect their own
<br>
lives.  These had an emotional response.  The subjects were specifically
<br>
instructed to make decisions based on how it would affect them personally.
<br>
These were not what I would call rational decisions.  The same paragraph
<br>
even notes that when they were asked to make the decision purely on cost
<br>
instead of personal factors, their was less emotional response.  This would
<br>
be a rational decision.  The choice as to which brand one prefers is
<br>
emotional.  The choice as to which brand is cheapest is rational.
<br>
<p>The article stated that people with damage to their emotion centers of the
<br>
brain can't make simple decisions such as scheduling a doctor's appointment,
<br>
whether to wear a seatbelt, or which product to buy for themselves.  That's
<br>
an emotional preference.  They can't choose which option they would prefer
<br>
for themselves.  It goes on to say that they have no trouble making these
<br>
decisions for other people.  Apparently their logic works fine for other
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>It appears that these so-called rational decisions are unaffected by
<br>
emotion.  It is only when the decision is going to make a change in the
<br>
quality of one's personal life, and requires one to express a preference for
<br>
one option over another, that the emotions come into play.  This seems to
<br>
fit the definition of rational versus emotional decisions.  As far as I can
<br>
tell, this research proves that emotions are NOT needed for rational
<br>
decisions, but they are require to develop personal preferences.
<br>
<p>Instead of saying that rational decisions require emotions, I think it would
<br>
be more accurate to say that expressing personal preferences for one thing
<br>
over another requires emotion.
