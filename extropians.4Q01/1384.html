Jeff commented on gun launched orbital systems.
<br>
<p>The problem is that the lighter you make something the more
<br>
difficulty it has in withstanding the G forces of launch.
<br>
The rail gun approach seems better in this case since
<br>
it can keep the G forces down.
<br>
<p>I do think either approach makes much more sense for
<br>
resupply pods.  It also makes sense from a manufacturing
<br>
perspective (hurling up aluminium and silicon ingots).
<br>
<p>The problem with the parabolic mirror approach to energy
<br>
production is that you have to keep the mirror focused
<br>
on the sun as it orbits around the Earth.  That is going
<br>
to require propellant mass I believe.  Spike could probably
<br>
tell us how much.  Unless you are planning on attaching it
<br>
to the station and using a mechanical orientation device. 
<br>
You also lose the sun half of the time so you are going
<br>
to need batteries.
<br>
<p>The approach does make a lot more sense because you can
<br>
use much more of the energy spectrum of the sun than PV
<br>
cells do.  You need conversion devices.  NASA Glenn Research
<br>
Center is working on Stirling engines to accomplish this.
<br>
<p>The numbers (at least for the solar panels) sound about
<br>
right to me.
<br>
<p>I'll note that we will have 6 people on the station for
<br>
the next week or so.  So we are going into space, just
<br>
very slowly.
<br>
