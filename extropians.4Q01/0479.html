<em>&gt; &gt;If anything, let me just mention that I asked a random sample of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;my English-speaking acquaintances about calling the 911 bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;cowardly&quot;, and I they replied that this usage would be just an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;empty figure of speech, distinct from the primary meaning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We agree to disagree, besides we ( U.S.) are engaged in memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare as well.
</em><br>
<p>Its rather indicative of how much the Laws of War have fallen into
<br>
disuse. I would bet that at least 90% of the general population would
<br>
claim that they don't exist. I'm not surprised that those in the
<br>
intelligentsia are completely ignorant of them, it tends to be a badge
<br>
of honor to be ignorant of military manners in much of the educational
<br>
world (much like some people are  proud of their ignorance of
<br>
computers).
<br>
<p>Of course, I imagine that since few educators have any expectation of
<br>
ever engaging in combat, the Laws of War are a rather academic subject
<br>
for them. Those of us who are military experienced are far more versed
<br>
in them because they impact our daily behavior. We can and are held
<br>
responsible for our acts on the battlefield as much as your daily
<br>
commuter is held responsible for their acts on the freeway.
<br>
<p>Academics discussing the Laws of War is much like Mongolian nomads
<br>
discussing drunk driving laws.
