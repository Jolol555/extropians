</em><br>
<p>Well, if we define 100% good/evil as having done the maximum number of
<br>
possible acts according to some value, even the Blight would likely end
<br>
up with everything else near 50% (it didn't seem to go out of its way to
<br>
do nasty things). But within this range there is still tremendous
<br>
differences. 
<br>
<p>I think Countermeasure might not have had much choice in what it did, so
<br>
it might actually have ended up 100% good if it did not cause the death
<br>
or limitation of one sentient more than was needed within some
<br>
reasonable safety margin.  On the other hand Old One/Godshatter did use
<br>
at least one sentient being as an expendable tool (Pham) and quite
<br>
clearly manipulated other beings to achieve their ends, even when they
<br>
were noble and might have been achievable through voluntary cooperation
<br>
given good enough explanations. 
<br>
<p>The actions of the Blight was never described in detail, but it seems
<br>
that it was most interested in further its own interests rather than
<br>
make existence miserable for other beings - it simply used them. It
<br>
could have been far worse (and less interesting) if it had been
<br>
sadistic.
<br>
<p>Woodcarver and Steel were relatively well developed characters and had
<br>
their own motivations. Steel clearly had some limited friendliness (even
<br>
if it was mainly acting) towards the children and other useful
<br>
individuals. Again, he was not 100% evil since he did not care for
<br>
making others miserable, just achieving his ends. Woodcarver on the
<br>
other hand may have caused some ethical transgressions by its
<br>
original experiments (although among tine intelligences concepts like
<br>
individual growth are rather slippery), but Flensler's later career was
<br>
its own.
<br>
<p>Of course, this shows that the expression &quot;100% evil/good&quot; might be
<br>
rather useless. In AFUTD it is rather caring vs. uncaring.
