<p><em>    &gt; My personal opinion at this point, for whatever it's worth, is that John

</em><br>
<em>    &gt; resorted to ad homonym arguments without provocation.
</em><br>
<p>Ok Eliezer, it's time to put your money where your mouth is. I want to see you say with a
<br>
straight face that the idea this war was not caused by the destruction of the World Trade
<br>
Center but because evil American oil companies want to build a pipeline in Afghanistan is not
<br>
stupid, or that USA has the world's largest supply of biological weapons, or that one nation
<br>
should never interfere with another under any circumstances, or that the American
<br>
government sent anthrax letters to itself to increase war fervor, or that the reaction to 911
<br>
was &quot;overboard and overly broad&quot;, or that after Mr. Bin Laden says he wants to kill Americans
<br>
and after he has killed 6 thousand American civilians he nevertheless does not want to kill
<br>
Americans, or that the true terrorists are the Americans, or that doing something because we
<br>
can must be dishonorable, or that it would be bad if Afghanistan were to become more like a
<br>
free modern nation such as the USA, or that no nation has caused as much destruction in the
<br>
world as the USA. So Eliezer pick one of the above statement, I don't care which one, and
<br>
defend it. I dare you!
<br>
<p>This is not a case of disagreeing with a colleague, this crap is brain dead dumb, on a pare
<br>
with flying saucers, perpetual motion machines and the lost city of Atlantis. But it's worse,
<br>
far worse, Bermuda triangle fans don't kill people and this is life and death. Forget about
<br>
the Singularity, if the bilge Samantha Atkins spews out were to be adopted you and I and
<br>
everybody we know would be dead in less than a decade.
<br>
<p>Of course it's possible that you're right and I have lost this argument, if so it's because I'm
<br>
a poor debater not because I'm wrong.
