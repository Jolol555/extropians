<p>This might be true. So basically, Islam has spread to SO many people
<br>
that it may be impossible to do anything about it. On the other hand,
<br>
there were times and places where Christianity was even more
<br>
ubiquitous and as ruthless, yet there were people who stood up to it
<br>
and prevailed (more often in their legacy than in person).
<br>
<p>Hypothetically, what if there was a religion (not Islam, a
<br>
hypothetical religion that doesn't exist at all in our timeline)
<br>
diametrically opposed to the liberal, secular, rational, humanist,
<br>
egalitarian values. Would it be acceptable for us to regard this
<br>
religion as a problem rather than as a valid point of view, much like
<br>
we regard bigotry and hatred as problems rather than as opinions?
<br>
<p>Have we arrived at a paradox?
<br>

* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
* and its Jihad.&quot;                                                   *
