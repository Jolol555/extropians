<em>&gt;We should remember that agreement isn't necessarily a sign of conformity

<em>&gt;but not sulfuric acid; and the vast majority of us similarly agree that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethnicity.  
</em><br>
<p>I think perhaps you haven't read the Extropian bylaws all that
<br>
closely--it appears you missed the part where we are all encouraged to
<br>
to think not to think of our bank accounts as our sole property, but
<br>
as common assets to be shared with others.  
<br>
<p>Hmmm.  You would give away the benefits of American citizenship (the
<br>
right to whatever work is available in America), and since you would
<br>
not want those jobs anyway, you gladly grant them to the immigrants,
<br>
who come from extremely low wage 3rd world countries....thereby
<br>
driving those jobs to the bottom in terms of wages. How big of you! 
<br>
<p>Since you gave away the rights of your fellow citizens to those jobs
<br>
at a living wage, it seems mighty arbitrary of you to draw the line at
<br>
your bank account.  C'mon now, get into the extropian spirit--give
<br>
with the cash!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;My purpose in asking people to voice their usually unspoken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assent was not to enforce conformity or to run the opposing viewpoint off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the list, but simply to show the world that the prolifically expressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opinions of a few posters do not represent the opinions of Extropians as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whole.  
</em><br>
<p>Naw, I am afraid you were just running a few pre-progammed routines. I
<br>
just pushed your pre programmed politically correct buttons, and you
<br>
responded by rote. 
<br>
<p>BTW, I am not a racist--my wife is Asian, and several other members of
<br>
my immediate family are people of color--I myself am part Indian...but
<br>
I am a culturist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we are going to run an open list and tolerate all ideas, 
</em><br>
<p>What about tolerating the idea of opening up your bank account??
<br>
<p><em>&gt;even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really awful ideas on the part of people who are willing to go on arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indefinitely, then we need to make sure that everyone else speaks up now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and then, or people will get the impression that the most prolific posters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represent transhumanism.  The flood of positive responses shows what most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of us believe.  The frequently included quibbles, rephrasings, and &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disagree with the part where you say...&quot; have amply shown up the remarks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about &quot;lemmings&quot; and &quot;political correctness&quot; as flamebait.
</em><br>
<p>Is that the label you chose to use when you have arguments other than
<br>
name calling? They  fed you the programs, but when I drill down, there
<br>
is no substance inside...
