<p><em>&gt; You obviously do not understand Samantha's position; it is a messianic pacifism-at-any-cost-including-freedom-and-security position that is inflamed with the fervour of religious certainty.  She therefore sees anyone and everyone who would disagree with it as dim and uncomprehending brutes;  if the UNDERSTOOD her, they couldn't OF COURSE help but to AGREE with her, for it is WITHOUT QUESTION in her mind that her position is RIGHT.

<p><p>That is an utter slanderous rant with no basis at all in
<br>
anything I have said or think.  Anyone with any memory at all is
<br>
quite aware that my opinions change when I believe I am wrong
<br>
and have shifted more than a few times when I see evidence they
<br>
are incorrect or incomplete.
<br>
<p>It would be more interesting to take apart why people such
<br>
at yourself choose to take absolutist condemnatory positions
<br>
against me that fly in the face of what I have said and
<br>
how I have said it so blatantly.
