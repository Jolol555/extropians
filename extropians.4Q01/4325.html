<p>I wonder if autism is due to a lowered plasticity in the systems of the
<br>
brain handling changes in value contingencies (such as the orbitofrontal
<br>
cortex, if we believe in the papers by Alessandro Treves and Edmund T.
<br>
Rolls). They get upset when situations change so their value estimates get
<br>
upset, have a hard time handling social interactions (where the values in
<br>
relationships are shifting all the time) and would likely get stuck in
<br>
behavioral loops. 
<br>
<p>I checked my AQ score; it was 26 - somewhat high but not extreme. I would
<br>
not be surprised if the average score on this list was above average, but
<br>
that could easily be due to other factors such as it being a self selected
<br>
group of technophiles on the net (with a high prevalence of XNTX
<br>
personalities). 
<br>
<p>The discussion near the end about genetic cures of Aspergers raises an
<br>
interesting issue: the traditional response is to shake one's head and say
<br>
we are risking to get rid of the next Bill Gates (OK, bad example, let's
<br>
say the next Tesla), which presupposes that all parents will select away
<br>
Asperger's genes. But I wonder if parents with mild Asperger's would feel
<br>
that way? Obviously few wants to have an autist child, but if they could
<br>
use genetics to guarantee that it would only be Asperger, or maybe even
<br>
guarantee a certain mild level of the state, would they not take it? After
<br>
all, among us geeks (generalizing wildly :-) such people are regarded as
<br>
more rational and reasonable than those people who constantly mix in too
<br>
much emotions and social stuff in their decisions. Maybe genetics would
<br>
lead to an entrenching of Aspergers instead of an eradication.
