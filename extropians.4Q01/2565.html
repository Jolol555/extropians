<em>&gt;From: Amara Graps &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20Pardon%20my%20rant&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111121936.LAA20869@well.com&gt;">amara@amara.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A loose collection of perhaps half-dozen associated groups who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;love wild open spaces and have a close affinity with their land,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who in the past had a long tradition of song, art, poetry and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deeply mystical life. They were in the middle of an intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emergence when the Soviets invaded. At that time, the different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Muslims (Shia and Sunni) cooperated, their brand of Islam was very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moderate, women were going to universities and 'unveiled', wearing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;western dress.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It might be hard to say _now_ who the Afghans are because at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1/2 of them are dead or in exile: murdered by the Soviets between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1979 and about 1985 and later by whoever else. That was about one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million Afghans killed. Or was it two million? three million?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nobody knows for sure. In the mid 1980s, the largest refugee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population in the world were Afghans: Many millions over the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the four million refugees in Pakistan, a couple of million in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Iran, hundreds of thousands in London, Paris, Canada, the USA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Austrailia. A newly-emerging intellectual class disappeared into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Soviet jails in 1979 and were not heard from again. Beautiful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ancient towns full of art treasures bombed flat. There is not much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left of the country any more.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The Afghans call the Soviet 1979 Invasion: &quot;The Catastrophe&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I wonder why.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that terrible things have happened to Afghanistan which is
<br>
why I think we need to remain after all this is over and help. I
<br>
have always had problems with the so called &quot;Prime Directive&quot; on
<br>
non-interference.
<br>
<p>Colin Powell said yesterday on &quot;Face The Nation&quot; that the U.S. is
<br>
committed to helping to rebuild Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>I think you will find some information you will appreciate at:
