<p><em>&gt;Zero, I think there is a basic concept at the heart of Islam that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seeing clearly, and one that a historical exegesis of the text of the Q'ran
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the substance of the Sunnah makes quite clear: The call to fight for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;freedom&quot; of Islam is grounded in the explicit goal of making Islam a state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion.  ALL of the contextualization to which you refer (especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surrahs 2:191-193) only makes sense if one sees the admonition to &quot;fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until Islam is a state religion.&quot;   The actual historical context of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mohammed's pronouncements on jihad developed make this quite clear: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mohammed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spoke these words to motivate his followers to fight relentlessly until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islam was established as the official religion governing the law of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;land, and only then to lay down their arms.
</em><br>
<p>This is the crux of the matter.  In my (admittedly superficial) study of 
<br>
Islam of late I was specifically looking for evidence that Muhammad exhorted 
<br>
Muslims to spread their faith militarily.  I could find none.  If you could 
<br>
refer me to what you have read which leads you to believe that Muhammad 
<br>
advocated military conversion of non-believers, I would greatly appreciate 
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>My reading leads me to believe that the Qur-an and Sunnah advocate force 
<br>
only to overcome religious persecution of Muslims.  This seems to be 
<br>
bolstered by the fact that during Muhammad's life he didn't persecute or 
<br>
initiate any wars against non-believers, unless and until they were 
<br>
persecuted first.
<br>
<p>He and his followers supposedly underwent a great deal of persecution at the 
<br>
hands of the leaders of Mecca, which is why they fled to Medina.  It is true 
<br>
that shortly after his arrival in Medina an Islamic government was 
<br>
established, with Muhammad as its leader.  But this, apparently, was not 
<br>
effected by military conquest.  From what I have read the will of the people 
<br>
in Medina was that Islam should become their faith and Muhammad should 
<br>
become their leader.  I suppose you could call his triumphant return to 
<br>
Medina a conquest, but by all accounts it was a bloodless coup.  And even 
<br>
then, the lives of those who previously persecuted Muhammad and his 
<br>
followers were spared.
<br>
<p>This, to me, seems to contradict the conclusions you have reached concerning 
<br>
Islam.  Granted, we are in agreement that there is a certain extremist 
<br>
faction in Islam today that advocates violent retribution to the &quot;infidel.&quot;  
<br>
But, as you have suggested, a religion (or any meme-set for that matter) 
<br>
should not be judged on the basis of its most extreme adherents.  If that 
<br>
were the case, our views of Christianity should be informed by the teachings 
<br>
and actions of such groups as, say, the Aryan Nations.
<br>
<p>Lastly, I hope you don't view this exchange as a &quot;debate.&quot;  I honestly don't 
<br>
know which of us is more right.  I came to this question believing as you 
<br>
apparently do, and searching for evidence that I was right.  I just haven't 
<br>
found it.  I sincerely want to read what you have read which leads you to 
<br>
your conclusions.  If you are interested, I'll gladly refer you to what I 
<br>
have read which has led me to mine.  Thanks for the input.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
