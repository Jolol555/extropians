<p><p><em>&gt; I currently work for a subsidiary of West Legal Group, the megacorp that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owns the copyright on the reference system most US lawyers use to refer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to US laws and cases.  Or, in short: they think they own the law in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US, and they're arguably right from a certain point of view.
</em><br>
<p>Funny -- I had an interesting discussion about West's ownership of legal IP
<br>
and the episodic assaults on that monopoly position with a very bright
<br>
Chinese lawyer just a few days ago!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, I was discussing the idea of lawyer-bots with my group's CTO,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how we might be able to develop them.
</em><br>
<p>,snip.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But unless I can get past the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface problem (different interface? different product?), no dice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anyone here has any practical suggestions on how to solve this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem?
</em><br>
<p>I've been thinking about it for going on 20 years.  Unfortunately, this is a
<br>
bad time for me to try to put my thoughts down in bits.  A hint at the
<br>
direction of my thinking over the years: The West key-numbering system is a
<br>
first, primitive step toward the kind of real semantic encoding necessary
<br>
for any AI to get a &quot;grip&quot; on the reservoir of emergent wisdom that is the
<br>
great body of reported common law decisions.  As any good law student will
<br>
tell you, though, the key-numbering system is missing a major piece, since
<br>
it doesn't encode the relationship of the statements of legal premises and
<br>
conclusions to the matrix of factual context in the case being indexed.
<br>
What's needed is a kind of &quot;factual mark-up language&quot; to embed these legal
<br>
concepts in the context that gives them meaning as a resource for reasoning
<br>
by analogy.  The best direction for this I've developed in my own thinking
<br>
is a standardize symbology and syntax for describing party-relationships and
<br>
transactional dynamics.  I've sketched out such a symbology and syntax
<br>
before, and would be very surprised if you couldn't find such a system
<br>
having been developed by some academic with more time than I have to pursue
<br>
such matters.
<br>
<p>I agree that if any company in the world has a motivation to fund such work,
<br>
it would be West; but your employer has been notoriously slow to adopt
<br>
technological innovation -- perhaps because of their long history of
<br>
monopoly.
