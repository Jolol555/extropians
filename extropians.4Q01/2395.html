From: &quot;Webb, Steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:swebb@asce.org?Subject=Re:%20Non-sensory%20experiences&In-Reply-To=&lt;010c01c16945$e54eef60$4a5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">swebb@asce.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think there may be some confusion here regarding my use of the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;feeling&quot; to describe the emotional state of &quot;eureka!&quot;.  I assert that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this emotional state is *not* a feeling the sense you're using it.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as I can tell, this *emotional state* resides entirely within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain (although there may be secondary effects transmitted outside of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain, e.g. ENS transmissions that cause goose pimples or make one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel flushed as a result of the &quot;eureka!&quot; experience.
</em><br>
<p>Feedback from the body qualifies as an experience, AFAIC. That experience
<br>
depends on sensory input, again, from the body. As you may have heard, Marvin
<br>
Minsky is working on an &quot;Emotion Machine&quot; that he believes will supply the
<br>
necessary emotional elements of AI. If we take the sensory part out of
<br>
experience, we are left with memories or artificial constructs of sensory
<br>
input. These phantom experiences can build emotional renditions of real life.
<br>
I'd call these &quot;emotional hallucinations&quot; rather than experiences. These
<br>
emotional hallucinations form perhaps the majority of what are called
<br>
&quot;religious experiences&quot; that some people report during (and especially after)
<br>
seizures. When we become untethered from real life experience, it's possible
<br>
to deceive ourselves that our imaginary emotional &quot;experiences&quot; are real, when
<br>
they are actually emotional hallucinations. I question the usefulness of
<br>
hypotheses about &quot;non-sensory experiences&quot; which do not include the
<br>
information that these &quot;experiences&quot; are derived from previous sensory events.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Earlier you offered a definition of &quot;sensory&quot; that supposedly cleared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything up:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the &quot;eureka!&quot; experience itself has nothing to do with the senses or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense organs as far as I can tell.  It's not a sensory experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because no senses are involved in the primary experience.  There may, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've said, be secondary sensory experiences, but the direction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmission seems to be from the brain to the sense organs, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way around.
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of the direction of transmission, the &quot;eureka!&quot; experience (note
<br>
well the exclamation mark, it is significant) relies on feedback in the
<br>
nervous systems of the organism. If the organism rewards itself with relief
<br>
and exhilaration upon solving a problem or discovering a cognitive pattern,
<br>
the experience is accompanied by sensations which are, of course, sensory. The
<br>
exclamation mark noted by the way you've referred to the &quot;eureka!&quot; experience,
<br>
denotes a shouting, celebrative vociferation. This vocalization (or
<br>
alternatively, silent relief of tension) provides auditory sensory input (or
<br>
the sensation of muscle relaxation, or whatever) to the brain. Hence,
<br>
self-stimulation also qualifies as a sensory event.
<br>
<p>I notice that the article which was the reason for beginning this discussion
<br>
failed to include any empirical evidence or experimental validation of the
<br>
hypothesized &quot;non-sensory&quot; experiences. While this does not necessarily prove
<br>
that such hypothesized experiences don't exist (it's impossible to prove a
<br>
negative, like trying to prove that ghosts do not exist), it does place the
<br>
subject squarely in the non-scientific field of human thinking. Besides being
<br>
useless speculation, the concept of &quot;non-sensory&quot; experience further muddies
<br>
the waters of human understanding by obscuring the meaning of the word
<br>
experience, which for all practical purposes involves one or more of the human
<br>
senses.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
