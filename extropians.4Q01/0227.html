I see both points of view here.  I don't think Rick is
<br>
suggesting anyone give up on trying to stay alive but
<br>
rather that people focus on helping both themselves
<br>
and humanity.  Such an approach yields a warmer
<br>
reception.  That is I believe what most of us are doing
<br>
but it gets frustrating watching the lemmings marching
<br>
off the cliff so we yell about not dying.
<br>
<p>I see this as a spin issue.  Helping yourself is good.
<br>
Helping most other people is good.  I seem some
<br>
ideas suggested in these massages that sound paradoxical but they are not.
<br>
<p>Helping future humanity seems a bit nebulous though.
<br>
Humanity is a stream of people at various ages.  To
<br>
try to guess what future humans will be like and help
<br>
them in some way other than working on the present
<br>
and near future is a bit to speculative for my taste.  I
<br>
don't think the future needs our help as much as the
<br>
present.  Folks in the future will probably have it pretty
<br>
easy.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fatal flaws, my ass.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Physical immortalists are working to accomplish longer, open-ended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lifespans and increased personal capabilities by working directly on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life extension, suspended animation and related technologies. There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeeep. At least, they should be working, and not just mouthing off about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. (Which reminds me of something, I'm just not sure about what).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another kind of immortality that has existed for thousands of years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and that will be essential to the progress in extending individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human lives indefinitely. It could be referred to as &quot;noospheric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immortality&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This better be good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Noospheric immortality, in a Classical Humanist sense, is accomplished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by discovering a new universal physical principle that contributes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Classical Humanists have no clue about physics, nor do they wish to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into posession of said clue. Otherwise, they would stop being Classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humanists, and become somebody else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the progress and well-being of future generations of mankind. Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't care about future generation. Well-being of future generations is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a side effect of personal immortality in the rational selfishness context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future generations, in a Classical Humanist education system, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strive to relive the original discovery of the new physical principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as they themselves prepare to uncover still newer universal physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles. By living in such a &quot;simulteneity of eternity&quot;, with great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Garbage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minds of the past, future generations lead to yet more human expansion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and success. Man's mastery over the universe leads to his increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population, extraterrestrial progress, and creates the preconditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neccessary to significantly increasing human lifespan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More garbage. This is so new-agey, it makes me want to puke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Immortality. Now. That's the kickstarter. And you know what, we could pull
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it off, if we try hard enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Within the context of Classical Humanism, proponents of physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immortality, can experience the apparently built-in human satisfaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of acquiring &quot;meaning&quot; in thier lives by contributing to the success
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of future human generations and thus &quot;making their mark in the world&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They must have skipped to install that &quot;human satisfaction&quot; module in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit at the fab. Thank you, I can get my &quot;meaning&quot; elsewhere. If you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my &quot;meaning&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether or not they themselves accomplish scientific immortality to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any significant degree. By doing so in a Classical Humanist way, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Classical Humanist way is to feed the worms, I thought?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maximize the possibilities for presevering and extending their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lives, as well, by maximizing the possibilities for promoting physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By feeding the worms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; economic progress that leads to true wealth creation and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; progress that recognizes human equality and that serves to limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oligarchic tendencies in society. Conversely, people who tend toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Classical Humanist values will find physical immortalism a much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attractive idea worth working on because Classical Humanist physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immortalists are, like them, interested in noospheric immortality by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WTF is noospheric immortality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contributing to mankind's future generations. Regular physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see, by being remembered as one of them who has fed the worms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immortalists, on the other hand, consider only personal physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immortality to be of value and do not consider their participation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eternal existence in the noosphere as something of value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Classical humanism&quot; is an historically proven web of ideas that lays
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Historically proven&quot; in this context = no good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the best foundation for progress. The ideas which constitute it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feeding the worms is not my idea of progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; found in a wide array of times and cultures throughout human history,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; though more strongly and notably at some points than others. Physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immortalism, on the other hand, has had few adherents. By considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ha! Ha! Ha!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical immortalism within a Classical Humanist framework, the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of living forever will become as natural an idea as civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; itself and, in addition, become more quickly achievable than through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any other set of social, political and economic ideas. If cryonicists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are looking for a way to increase their numbers, Classical Humanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deserves to be examined thoroughly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope.
