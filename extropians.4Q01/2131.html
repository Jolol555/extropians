<em>&gt; &gt;Certainly don't ignore them.  But it would be good to also not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;accept the first proposed action that comes along without due

<em>&gt; &gt;considerations of its consequences, costs (in all measures),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whether it is is just response and whether it is likely to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the desired effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we've given the matter considerable thought, and I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our current action is correct. Deatroy those who perpetrated this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atrocity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have taken some trouble to dialog with you about why that
<br>
isn't precisely what is being done and about why the way we are
<br>
running this campaign is a human rights disaster in the making. 
<br>
So I am surprised to see such a categorical statement at this
<br>
point. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;These people were dependent on foreign aid for food before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;9/11.  What food they were getting has largely been disrupted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We orderd the ending of the truck caravans from Pakistan that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;brought in most of the food by 9/16.  Most of rest is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;impossible to deliver while the bombardment continues.  In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;week or two at most (and perhaps already for some areas) it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be too late for many.  Is this actually a goal that any of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;support or desire?  Do we believe that continuing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bombardment is worth this consequence.  I don't.  We can't speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the good of the people as justification for our actions at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this time if our actions are directly threatening the deaths of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;millions of innocent civilians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know where they get their food, and in fact the vast majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it comes from the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if it does or did come mainly from the US or not. 
<br>
But I know it is not happending now and hasn't been since
<br>
mid-September when the truck convoys were stopped.  What was
<br>
left has all but dried up due to the bombing.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I've already said I thought we should have done things differently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should have seized a major airbase like the one at Mazer-l-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sharif and begun re-establishing food distribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, we should not stop, not for Ramadan, not for anything at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>We should not stop if 3-4 million people will die of starvation
<br>
if we don't restart the food transport and distributing very
<br>
very soon now?  How on earth do you figure that sort of
<br>
callousness is justified?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;That will be utterly insufficient to eliminate terrorism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your right, a great deal more will need to be done, but placating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists will not be part of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Keeping 3-4 million civilians from starving this winder is
<br>
&quot;placating terrorsts&quot;? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Then you are not familiar with history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary history is one of my favorite subjects, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the history of conflict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I did not say it justifies it.  I said that speaking as if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;was only lies and fundamentalism that give rise to the anger is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;speaking falsely and simplistically.  There is a big difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their anger is a combination of things including their incorrect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception of us, and the way the world works. I have no intention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of changing to please them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am concerned with their correct perception of the atrocious
<br>
things we have done in the region and around the world.  If you
<br>
cannot admit we have done such things then I guess there is no
<br>
point in continuing down that line with you.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I do not care if they don't like us, but they will care if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't parse that sentence.  We say we stand for certain things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in the world and I propose that we actually act as if we do and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that we correct ourselves where we act as if we do not.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are counting people then their are  over 6 billion reather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;250 million.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No the U.S, is some 265 million, the rest of the world was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacked, we were. We do stand for many things, one of them is you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can count on retaliation if you attack us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The world does not revovle around the US.  It is about time we
<br>
learned that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;That will be insufficient.  Especially as we have already passed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;significant measures greatly dangerous to our domestic freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and well-being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We passed a bunch of such measures over the last 8 years and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barely heard a peep, except from the NRA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Does that somehow make more measures OK?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Then why concentrate your contempt only on their media?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was making a point about the falsehoods they spread affecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs of the people of the region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You do not think that others will also gain money and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sanctuary and support?  There is a lot of wealth in the MidEast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and a lot of anger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anybody who wants to be next to die is welcome to try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I see.  Anyone who is upset enough to attack, even if they have
<br>
good reason to be upset, will be destroyed and their country
<br>
laid waste possibly including a lot of their civilians.  So we
<br>
don't need to examine our policies and change those are wrong. 
<br>
After all we are the baddest muther on the block.  Excuse me if
<br>
that sickens me.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Are you ignorning the point that you may be missing something?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Or that we are being told ourselves in part lies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;half-truths?  How will you find out?  Do you care to or are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;comfortable with the current assumption that the current means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;horrendous as they may be in consequences of famine in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Afghanistan, are sufficient and the &quot;right thing&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am completely confident in our ability to both punish the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attackers and help the people of Afghanistan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>On what basis are you confident?  We  have made no plans or
<br>
promises to avoid the impending famine.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No.  We don't know precisely who did the attack.  We do know who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bin Laden is and that he is a sworn enemy but that is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;same thing as knowing he is guilty of this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, we do know who did the attack and we do know who they work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then prove it.  Oh, I forgot, of course you can't prove it which
<br>
only proves that a smart deranged fellow like bin Laden must be
<br>
guilty.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Do you know where the CIAs money had come from, btw, for many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;its black ops over the years?  Largely from drugs.  Follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;source and flow of drugs and you will find the hands and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;lifeblood of some of our own cladestine activities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be happy to see the people in the CIA who engaged in any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity serve time for such acts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, we have ignored know incidents of these kinds for the last
<br>
40+ years or given those involved a slap on the wrist.  I am
<br>
glad you would like to see justice there.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Actually, no they don't when it comes to international law.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;perhaps you would say that isn't civilized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually yes they do, even the U.N. recognizes our right to attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who attacked us as valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually we did not OK these actions or present evidence.  We
<br>
claimed we did not need too.  We claimed we did not need to show
<br>
the Taliban our evidence when we &quot;requested&quot; the extradition of
<br>
bin Laden.  We have basically told the world they are &quot;either
<br>
with US or with the terrorists&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I see.  So much for yuur early seeming claim we were only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;involved in Afghanistan and then would go home.  Will you then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;go after Hammas and other groups?  Do you think you can end or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;eviscerate so much anger by militarily finding the most actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;angry and killing them and inflicting whatever &quot;collateral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;damage&quot; it takes?  To me this is a very very dangerous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;twisted fallacy that can do nothing but much more seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;inflame the world and endanger all of us (all of humanity not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;just us) and what we hold most dear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you think you can placate these groups and they will all go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; away? And at what price?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I think if we do not address the causes of what righteous anger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;toward us may be in the region that all the bombs and guns in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the world will not be enough to keep us safe.  We should bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;international criminals to justice certainly.  But I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what we are doing now is a step toward justice.  I think it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;step toward further hatred and terror and millions of deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think their anger is &quot;righteous&quot; at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you think their is no righetous anger fueling terrorists acts
<br>
against the US then you are ill-informed, dishonest or both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These people are more than international criminals, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists, and they have comitted an act of war against a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sovereign nation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Criminals are not empowered to commit an &quot;act of war&quot;. 
<br>
Criminals should be hauled before a suitable court and if
<br>
convicted, suitably punished.  We should not collaterally cause
<br>
the deaths of 3-4 million in the process of bringing them to
<br>
justice.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's time to pay the price.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The price is too high.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I think we should have presented our evidence before world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;courts and the Taliban and then demanded bin Laden be turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;over.  I think we must stop the bombing now while there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ghost of a chance to save millions of Afghani lives this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;winter.  I think continuing the bombing through the holy month
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of Ramadan would be a seen as extremely callous and will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;political and cultural disaster.   And most of all I think we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would be fools to extend this campaign into other countries in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world court doesn't have the authority and if I have anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say about it, it never will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I hope for the sake of most of the world that you will not have
<br>
that much to say about it as the US is currently threatening to
<br>
run amok wherever it things anyone that might be interested in
<br>
threatening it is to be found.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you missed my last post, as I pointed out we already tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the weak liberal &quot;take them to court&quot; bit. We have 5000 people dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of it. We won't be making that mistake again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, you would rather have 4 million dead and the region even
<br>
more inflamed than it was to produce the Sept 11 atrocity?  Does
<br>
this make sense to you?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Muslim countries have always fought through Ramadan and so should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are not Muslim.  In my opinion it is an insult added to a
<br>
huge potential human rights injury that will not be forgotten or
<br>
forgiven for a long time.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As to our next step. How do you think there can ever be peace in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the middle east as long as groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, who's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sole reason of existence is to destroy Israel, are permitted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That is a canard.  The Hezbollah came into power when it turned
<br>
back the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  At least give some
<br>
balance and acknowldge that the Palestinians have cause for
<br>
unrest and that in all justice there should be a real (versus
<br>
the planned toy) Palestinian state and that Israel has acted
<br>
quite badly and even employed more than a little terrorism
<br>
itself over the last 35 years.
