</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There have been court cases where the &quot;father&quot; was ordered to pay child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support despite DNA tests proving that he was not the father.  The practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect of this recent direction is that there is a statute of limitations on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a biological father as far as child support goes.  If it takes you a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years to figure out that your wife has been sleeping around and the kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't yours, you can be held to be responsible for child support regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the biological father takes no responsibility.  This doesn't seem right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but some courts have ruled this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to establish paternity in such a way that your responsibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be based on DNA tests, it needs to be done shortly after the child is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born to still be in the clear legally.  Otherwise, for the purposes of child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support payments, you may be considered the father simply because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed you were.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. WHile this may vary from state to state, here in NH, paternity
<br>
tests can only have an impact on ones parental status if performed
<br>
within the first two years of the child's life. After that time, it is
<br>
assumed that the child has formed an emotional dependecy bond of sorts
<br>
(and hopefully vice versa for the father) that the state is generally
<br>
against breaking.
<br>
<p>Now, even if the paternity tests occur after this point, if you wind up
<br>
breaking up or divorcing from the woman, you still have the option of
<br>
suing her for fraud and filing false documents if she claims later that
<br>
its not your kid. You can sue for repayment of all moneys paid to her
<br>
for child support, her share of maintenance of the common household,
<br>
child care expenses while cohabiting, as well as seeking punitive
<br>
damages for emotional distress.
<br>
<p>If you are intent on establishing and maintaining full or partial
<br>
custody of the child, the threat of such a lawsuit is quite useful in
<br>
discouraging her against really prosecuting a claim that you are not the
<br>
father. Furthermore, if you are intent on keeping the child, do NOT,
<br>
under any circumstances, submit to a paternity test after the two year
<br>
period unless ordered by the judge. So far as the law is concerned, the
<br>
fact that your name is on the birth certificate is all you need to
<br>
establish that you are the father after that point. Even if you are not
<br>
biologically the father, the principle of not giving away any evidence
<br>
you don't have to holds here.
