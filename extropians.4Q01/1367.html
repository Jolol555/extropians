<p><em>&gt; Thinking about this further, escrow services came to mind. Namely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when two countries sign a treaty, they agree on a neutral third party
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an arbitrator, and both present the arbitrator with a check for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreed-upon amount. The arbitrator has the resources to monitor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compliance with this treaty (and is compensated for their troubles by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the principals). If the arbitrator finds that the treaty has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violated, it cashes the check from the side that violated it and gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the money to the other side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then, the sincerity level of a government entering into a treaty could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be assigned a numerical value taking into account how much money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're putting on the line as a percentage of their tax income and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their previous history of defaults on treaties (just like S&amp;P publish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratings for how likely governments are to default on their business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commitments).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This way, an open market for international law (competing arbitration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agencies) can exist without the arbitration agencies having to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently well armed to enforce treaties broken by, say, the US or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China. Palestinians and Israelis can continue making &quot;agreements&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other in bad faith, but nobody will take these agreements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously until both sides put their money where their big mouths are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whadja'll think?
</em><br>
<p>As with the proposed use of escrows in various private law schemes we've
<br>
talked about over the years, I think this is a bad idea.  One benefit of a
<br>
good legal system is the reduction of transaction costs borne in its
<br>
absence.  Escrows are exactly the kind of burden you're trying to avoid when
<br>
you use law rather than some other system of social relations -- after all,
<br>
an escrow is really just a form of hostage-holding.
<br>
<p>The problem with regimes of international law is developing truly &quot;legal&quot;
<br>
methods of &quot;execution&quot;, i.e. of enforcement of the results of the legal
<br>
process.  In this instance, we'd be looking for an analog of a mortgage or
<br>
other kind of security interest.  In practice, of course, this is what
<br>
happens in the completely anarchic state of international affairs: A
<br>
country's goods -- defined in the most general sense -- are exposed to loss
<br>
in consequence of breaches of the peace.  The step toward law is to better
<br>
define those goods that are subject to forfeit and the conditions that can
<br>
trigger forfeiture.
<br>
<p>BTW, one of these days soon, I'll be writing something I thought I'd be
<br>
pushed by my friends to write sooner -- a defense of my endorsement of state
<br>
action in the present crisis, given my vocal libertarianism in the past ...
