</em><br>
<p>OK.  So you have some common ground there.  I tend toward a
<br>
blend of raja yoga and a bit of buddhism and some things from
<br>
Christian mysticism myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But your initial question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that you see contemporary mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-fundamentalist religions as this kind of benign, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial, spiritualism; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, actually I think things have deteriorated enough that a
<br>
lot of mainstream anything is at best kind but vapid and at
<br>
worse quite noxious.  But then,  some of that is my attitude
<br>
talking.  To be mainstream has come to mean so homogenized and
<br>
whitewashed that there is little good or harm left.  Most of the
<br>
people, of whatever philosophy and religion, are simply not
<br>
fully engaged on any level.  That is pretty sad news.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; while I see most of them as over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edge.  Even something as seemingly benign as Christianity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not merely extra-rational or supra-rational, it is decidedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-rational, and that's not acceptable.  
</em><br>
<p>Please say in what ways you consider it to be so.  I would agree
<br>
that any system that teaches people to force themselves to
<br>
believe such and such whether they do or not to avoid
<br>
consequences in the here-after is anti-rational.  It is also
<br>
mongrel spirituality.  But I would not paint everything that the
<br>
term &quot;Christianity&quot; applies to 
<br>
as anti-rational.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Spirituality has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place _beside_ rational thought; but those who actively oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the latter, even when they don't realize it, are a danger to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future.
</em><br>
<p>I mostly agree except that I think more clarification of what is
<br>
and is not rational is required.  I have heard things proposed
<br>
that seem rational technically but which lead to consequences
<br>
totally unacceptable - to a world I would not want to live in.
