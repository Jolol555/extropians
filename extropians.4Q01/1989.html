<p>
Repeatedly ranting the standard socialist/leftarchist anti-capitalism
<br>
party line?  Huh?  I've been following Samantha's posts since 9/11 and I
<br>
haven't seen much of anything I'd call anti-capitalist.  Anti-American
<br>
maybe, but really not even that.  Samantha started off obviously furious
<br>
about 9/11.  On 9/13, for example, she wrote that:
<br>
<p>&quot;The long term effect of playing it diplomatic and making only token
<br>
response is screaming from all communication channels. Such responses
<br>
over decades led directly to the events of
<br>
Tuesday.  I want to do more than &quot;discourage&quot; future attacks.  I want to
<br>
remove the groups who are the threat and the governments who support
<br>
such threats.   They can be angry but they will
<br>
respect us or else.  We are not the aggressor.  They are.&quot;
<br>
<p>On 9/14 she wrote:
<br>
<p>&quot;Arrogant?  We deserve to be righteously angry and dig out those who did
<br>
this to us. 
<br>
Arrogant? Our system IS better than that of most of the pestholes that
<br>
hate us and threaten us and our citizens at every opportunity.  Or don't
<br>
you care to notice the distinction? 
<br>
Arrogant?  We very seldom &quot;throw our weight around&quot; really.  With our
<br>
power most nations would really be arrogant and extremely expansionist.
<br>
But we are not.  We often don't even
<br>
use our power when we despearately need to.  We will not play by rules
<br>
that require us to be nice to those who play by no rules at all.&quot;
<br>
<p>As the debate has progressed her position seems to have changed quite a
<br>
bit -- enough to make me wonder whether there are two Samanthas, though
<br>
both seem to have the same e-mail address.  Admittedly, her position has
<br>
changed in response to calls for genocide, nuking Afghanistan, and other
<br>
such extreme measures.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Samantha was ranting the standard socialist/leftarchist
<br>
anti-capitalism party line prior to my joining the list on or about
<br>
9/11?
