<p>
I'm going to propose a heresy -- and probably get myself dragged
<br>
over the coals for it -- but nothing ventured, nothing gained.
<br>
<p>I am going to propose that &quot;information&quot; should not be free.
<br>
This is based on the idea that if you are insufficiently
<br>
educated with regard to the information you cannot properly
<br>
evaluate its significance and use it responsibly (extropically).
<br>
<p>So, for example, a limited knowledge of molecular biology, genetic
<br>
engineering, etc. has given a large number of people an axe to
<br>
grind against AgBio companies.  As recent experiments have shown,
<br>
the Monarchs do not seem to be at risk from GM crops.  No significant
<br>
ill effects have been demonstrated for GM crops.  And yet it seems
<br>
likely that people will continue to purchase &quot;organic&quot; crops
<br>
disproportionately to any benefit that they can reasonably expect
<br>
to receive from them.  I.e. people can be &quot;programmed&quot; to behave
<br>
irrationally (events of the last month being a possible case in
<br>
point).
<br>
<p>To take two recent Extropian topics --
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Aging isn't a disease&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Do we have any question that Laura Bradbard from the FDA has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done the extensive survey that Robert Freitas has done
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to begin a rational classification of what &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a &quot;disease&quot;?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Fwd: Secrecy foe scrubs data on Internet&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Do we have any evidence that any potential terrorists have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not already obtained the information on these sites (in which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case scrubbing it is pointless) or that scrubbing it will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely to increase security? (It may decrease it since the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scrubbing may not allow members of the general public to know
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what potential targets may exist and exercise a right to avoid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proximity to such targets).
<br>
<p>I do not claim to be a security expert or to understand the details
<br>
of the U.S. security system.  However my general impression is that
<br>
it operates on the basis of a &quot;need-to-know&quot; and &quot;trustability&quot;.
<br>
<p>Should the knowledge to manufacture chemical weapons or biological
<br>
weapons be available to those who would use them unextropically?
<br>
I believe the concept developed in the Aristoi -- that one had
<br>
to develop the skills to use knowledge productively and the
<br>
trust relationships that you would use such skills in an extropic
<br>
fashion are worthy of consideration.  I do not believe we have
<br>
successfully dealt with the issue of when &quot;freedom&quot; is extropic,
<br>
e.g. from Extropian Principles 3.0, Section 5, &quot;Open Society&quot;:
<br>
&quot;freedom of speech, freedom of action, freedom of experimentation&quot;
<br>
runs directly up against, Section 6, &quot;Self-Direction&quot;:
<br>
&quot;independent thinking, indepdendent freedom, personal responsibility&quot;
<br>
<p>Do you have the freedom to speak for the destruction of a people?
<br>
Do you have the right to act towards such a goal?
<br>
Should &quot;independent thinking&quot; be promoted if it is &quot;irrational&quot;
<br>
(violating principle 7)?  &quot;Remaining open to challenges to our
<br>
beliefs and practices&quot; seems to leave open the door to people
<br>
being willing to sacrifice their lives to challenge your beliefs
<br>
and practices.
<br>
<p>This is a fundamental question for me -- on the one hand I would
<br>
certainly like the information to be available to overthrow an
<br>
oppressive government dedicated to limiting my freedoms.  At the
<br>
same time I am reluctant to adapt a position that makes such
<br>
information available to people (essentially &quot;other tribes&quot;)
<br>
that would like to use it not only to destroy my security shield
<br>
but *my* way of thinking entirely (be it *either* a U.S. self-preservation
<br>
or an extropic maximization of information content perspective).
<br>
<p>So, here is the question:
<br>
<p>Should access to information be based on accreditation?
<br>
