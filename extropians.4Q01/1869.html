<p>
Alex,
<br>
<p>Thanks for the defense.  I am not sure I need it.  Mainly I am
<br>
very bored by the number of relatively predictable and firmly
<br>
entrenched attitudes I have encountered on this list of late. 
<br>
If they were an example of future thinking and vision then I
<br>
would be very depressed indeed.  I get bored and fed up with the
<br>
&quot;all religion is bad and your enemy&quot; or echoes of &quot;we are all
<br>
light and 'they' are all dark&quot; memes.  I would hope that the
<br>
brilliant and future focused people on this list are more immune
<br>
to such categorical closed-mindedness.  
<br>
<p>I recognize that it is very difficult when angry and worried
<br>
about the present and future especially to see sides of a
<br>
situation that one would prefer not to see.  I recognize that it
<br>
hurts like bloody hell to take note of where your notions about
<br>
how good your people and country are and are not might be a bit
<br>
one-sided or slanted from the true situation.  I know it was
<br>
hell on me to begin to take off some of my own blinders and I
<br>
don't expect it to get any easier.  But I think we have to
<br>
examine our pet assumptions and positions, now more than ever.  
<br>

</em><br>
<p>I am a software goddess, computer scientist, geek girl, super
<br>
nerd - take your pick.  I don't know that that has any bearing
<br>
on what I say being reasonable or not though.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2. She actually supports individual liberty and technological

</em><br>
<em>&gt; left-right spectrum view as socialist. In contrast, the true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leftilists only want freedom for people to practice the one true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leftilist faith, and that necessitates an all-controlling collectivist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state. Since leftilists have a simplistic, us-vs-them view of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamics, and they know that *they* certainly haven't created anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of note, they view innovations with hostility and suspicion-- as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts by the rich white male elite to grab even more power.
</em><br>
<p>To be fair that isn't all a particularly leftist viewpoint but
<br>
ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, I differ with Samantha on a number of issues. She is an Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who disagrees with me, and those are the ones who really help me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop my ideas. Where she is right, I hope to become right. Where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she is wrong I get to develop my persuasive skills. Where she is wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and doesn't budge, I get to study the psychology of stubbornness. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope you feel the same way, Samantha, are don't misconstrue this as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slight. Some of the other things I've seen said to you are hard not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to interpret that way, but I do think they were made in the heat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment rather than as calculated insults.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't take it as a slight at all.  Thanks for saying it.  
<br>
<p>I don't hold grudges for slights and insults.  Now and then I do
<br>
give up on talking with someone for at least a while.
<br>
