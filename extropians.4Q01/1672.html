<p>
Up until this general part of history at least. I was watching some PBS
<br>
last night, and they were doing a piece on the guy who originally made
<br>
the claims about a &quot;God spot&quot; in the brain (only, he says the media mis-
<br>
reported his comments... that's another story). There was also a long
<br>
interview with a guy who suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy who after
<br>
having a seizure would find himself in an extreme &quot;joy mode&quot; where anything
<br>
he looked at or thought about would seem to be imbued with extreme meaning
<br>
and beauty.
<br>
<p>So if the brain has built in hardware for creating these feelings, which
<br>
tend to produce religion in societies (and we can see why epileptic
<br>
&quot;prophets&quot; in olden times would be exactly the people expected to write
<br>
stuff like the Bible and other religious documents), it must have evolved
<br>
for a reason. People with this hardware are more likely to survive and
<br>
reproduce. Societies of these people are more likely to outcompete other
<br>
groups of people who don't have it. Perhaps it allows these groups of
<br>
people to &quot;stop worrying&quot; and get on with work that might help them
<br>
survive? Or is religion just a fluke- the brain hardware only seems to
<br>
generate feelings of deep meaning and &quot;joy&quot;, perhaps feeling attached
<br>
to your surroundings and people helped those people and societies do
<br>
better, and later on those feelings got interpreted by individuals to
<br>
be significant- boom, you get religions.
<br>
<p>You have to ask yourself- if people didn't have these feelings, would
<br>
(for instance) the USA have grown quite as fast and well as it has?
<br>
Would the world have otherwise developed a bit more slowly without these
<br>
&quot;positive outlook&quot; individuals?
