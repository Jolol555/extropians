<p>Overall, these exampels seem to point out the societies that have less

have more technological progress.  Now, a counterargument to this could
<br>
be that there's a certain level of government needed -- more than

anarchy, but less than a modern welfare state.  Some, like Rand and von
<br>
Mises, defend just this claim.
<br>
<p>### Exactly. I do too.
<br>
------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, absent any evidence or good
<br>
theoretical arguments for a lower limit on government, I think it
<br>
bolsters the claim for anarchism.
<br>
<p>### Caloric restiction prolongs life-span in lab animals. Does it bolster
<br>
the claim for the Dickensian diet of one straw per day as the best diet for
<br>
a horse? Hardly. If you do not understand the exact way the government and
<br>
society at large interact (and nobody does), you cannot make extrapolations
<br>
of this sort. We have to rely on empiric evidence, which clearly shows that
<br>
ungoverned societies are transient phenomena at low population densities, or
<br>
immediately after the breakdown of a government.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's say the colonists just arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haphazardly from other planets, in small groups, like the Native
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Only the ones I gave you earlier.
<br>
<p>### Too few and too limited to special, unusual conditions.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Coercion always comes first - government comes later. This played
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies hundreds of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (again, Native Americans, Polynesians......)
</em><br>
<p>Is your argument that coercion comes, then as a reaction to it, people
<br>
form governments -- institutions for coercion -- to stop it?  If so, my
<br>
argument would be that government is not necessary to do this.  I
<br>
believe a competitive, market solution is much better.
<br>
<p>### Examples? 
<br>
<p>I have a lot examples of my own (governed societies crushing everybody
<br>
else), so you need some very powerful ones of your own.
<br>
<p>-----&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; What do you mean exactly? Communes putting together their monies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to buy land from the rich? Where on Earth did they form (aside from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those insignificant credit unions)?
</em><br>
<p>On your parenthetic comment: if credit unions are so insignificant, why
<br>
are banks worried about them?  Why do banks lobby to have credit unions
<br>
severely restricted?
<br>
<p>### Credit unions are insignificant as means of common military
<br>
self-defense.
<br>
<p>(Their importance for the economy is another issue. I support them and I
<br>
agree with you that the banking industry's lobbying against them is immoral
<br>
and ecomically counterproductive)
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Precisely what types of &quot;small businesses&quot; are going to help each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other out, trying to stop land consolidation and how?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Landowners do - they hire accountants, overseers, and hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peons to do the work, if such laboreres are available due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarcity of land.
</em><br>
<p>But what about the overall context of this?  If the peons they are
<br>
hiring are getting paid, then there's always a chance they can put aside
<br>
money or such to buy land themselves.
<br>
<p>### In 17th century Poland some landowners would pay their farmhands in a
<br>
private currency redeemable only in the landowner's own general stores.
<br>
Since no other stores were allowed to operate on the farm, the prices were
<br>
finely balanced to prevent starvation, give a little extra for vodka, and
<br>
keep the workers utterly dependent. All of it without any gov't
<br>
intervention. No taxes, either. Pure, unadulterated private initiative, with
<br>
a large enough farm (10x5 acres), becomes worse than a state. 
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p>Also, if the wealthy landowners in your model compete with each other,
<br>
then the price of land will also rise as will the price of their
<br>
laborers.  (This is why subsistence wages probably won't be the rule.)
<br>
<p>### They were and in the New Colombia they would (nothing will prevent
<br>
landowners from issuing currency, and if you are desperate enough, you will
<br>
not insist on being paid in gold). 
<br>
<p>------
<br>
Unless you posit some sort of class consciousness for the wealthier
<br>
landowners -- and if you do, how does it arise (since in your original
<br>
model everyone starts out the same) and how does it perpetuate itself
<br>
(as consolidation proceeds, the profit to be made by compete against
<br>
each other will rise plus) -- there wil lbe no reason to expect a two
<br>
class system of everyone else and big landowners.
<br>
<p>### As soon as you make a couple hundred thousand K more than the proles,
<br>
you develop a class consciousness. 
<br>
<p>Thousand-year experience shows that a class system emerges spontaneously. It
<br>
is similar to the phenomenon of symmetry-breaking in physical systems, which
<br>
frequently results in a phase transition.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(On the perpetuation
<br>
issue, imagine this.  As you say, all the landowners want to increase
<br>
their shares.  Some are better than others.  X, e.g., is the best in
<br>
area A, while Y is the best in area B.  When X buys up all of A and Y
<br>
buys up all of B, as you assume, why wouldn't X and Y compete with each
<br>
other?  Why wouldn't one or the other attempt to buy each other out?
<br>
Why would they stop only at that moment and not before or after?)
<br>
<p>### Once a few families own 95% of everything, the system stabilizes, until
<br>
changed by outside forces or technological developments. See Russia, France
<br>
- sometimes minor reshuffling occurs, with little influence on the life of
<br>
the landless serfs).
<br>
<p>------  
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who is going to ward off mergers??? Why? How?
</em><br>
<p>A contractual agreement could arise under private property where a group
<br>
of farmers agree to a convenant not to sell off their land.  This is a
<br>
restriction on their property right, but one they agree to.  (This
<br>
happens today with neighborhood convenants -- e.g., where people agree
<br>
only to sell their property if their neighbors agree to the sale or
<br>
where people voluntarily restrict the uses to which their property can
<br>
be put, such as disallowing commercial or nuisance uses.  There are even
<br>
planned communities where this is carried out to a further degree.)
<br>
<p>### Happens mainly with rich folks who want to preserve the scenic views and
<br>
keep the colored out. This has no relevance to the agrarian aconomy.
<br>
<p>----------
<br>
<p>Why would people do this?  It's often for cultural or property value
<br>
maintenance.  In the former case, people want to live in certain
<br>
settings.  In your example, it's quite possible to imagine yoemen
<br>
farmers who decide that 100 acre farms are the ideal and anything bigger
<br>
will destroy this sort of Jeffersonian culture of self-sufficiency.
<br>
(I'm not saying the whole planet would adopt this.)
<br>
<p>### Exactly. If the colonists agree to restrict their freedom (to freely
<br>
dispose of their property), the system will work. Of course you will need to
<br>
enforce such restrictions. You will need a police force. User fees (to use
<br>
an euphemism). A state. 
<br>
<p>Since the colonists' offspring, who themselves didn't participate in the
<br>
decision making, are bound by the laws of their fathers, they are not free
<br>
agents, and the system is not an anrchy. If they rebel, the (initially)
<br>
&quot;private&quot; police force chartered by their ancestors will stop them, or else
<br>
the system will break down. 
<br>
<p>Either way you are proving my point - absolute economical freedom, even in
<br>
the framework of non-coercion, and respect for contracts (miraculously
<br>
maintained without cops), contains the seeds of its own destruction.
<br>
<p>----- 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We agreed there is no coercion allowed in this experiment, so you
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; have to be pretty smart, trying to stop landowners from consolidating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their holdings by marriage.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  This would depend on what marriage entailed.  All of this
<br>
has to do with the culture and what people agree to.
<br>
<p>### But what if they don't agree with you? If somebody says he wants to
<br>
marry his neighbor and combine their holdings, what can you do about it?
<br>
(Remember, you have no cops working for you, and no laws, and your neighbor
<br>
didn't sign a contract with you)
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are forgetting that the large landowners make more money than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the small ones, both gross, and sometimes even per acre (they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford the expensive, imported machines). The less land available for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sale there is, the more difficult it is for the small operators to
</em><br>
join the
<br>
<em>&gt; game.
</em><br>
<p>Still, as supply decreases, all other things being equal, price will
<br>
rise.  This might mean in your model that latter sellers make more
<br>
money -- in fact, maybe enough to not turn into subsistence workers for
<br>
big landowners.  This will create an incentive to hold out.
<br>
<p>### You can't hold out if you have 2 acres (from the division of you
<br>
father's 10 acre farm). You have to sell, or borrow against it. You will
<br>
lose. Just ask small farmers (who all scream for subsidies, because that's
<br>
the only way they can survive).
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>Let's look at this realistically.  In any such society, there will be
<br>
incompetent landowners -- for whatever reason -- and unlucky ones.
<br>
There will be highly competent ones and very lucky ones -- the guy get
<br>
the best top soil even if his farming practices leave something to be
<br>
desired.  But there will also be the vast middle grade in between.  The
<br>
inefficient landowners probably should get bought up and find something
<br>
else to do.  The ones in the middle will always have a chance to be
<br>
among the buyers (driving up the prices for the big guys) or to plan
<br>
ahead, since their fortunes are not so marginal.  Unless you assume from
<br>
the start there are only good morons and evil geniuses -- yet with both
<br>
groups deciding to abide by libertarianism -- your model probably won't
<br>
come about.
<br>
<p>### In a true free market economy, over the long run the winners take all.
<br>
If you can own unencumbered, productive land, have enough for your private
<br>
spending, and buy a little bit more land every year, your profits keep
<br>
growing. It means you can outbid others, including the runner up. In the
<br>
end, there is only one. I prefer the slightly unfree market, with provisions
<br>
against land monopolies.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Three, you assume that inheritance alone will preserve large estates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Historically, this has not been the case.  In fact, inherited wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; often declines after a time.  Surely, there are exceptions, but even
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; biggest family fortunes tend to get consumed over time and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entrepreneurial and frugal family members take over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Historically, that *was* the case, at least in countries with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primogeniture (or can you give me specific and numerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterexamples?).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, from my reading this was _the_ problem in the Frankish
<br>
kingdoms, where land was divided equally among male offspring.  What
<br>
happened was big estates eventually were broken into ever smaller
<br>
ones -- a process helped by other social processes going on in the early
<br>
Middle Ages.
<br>
<p>### Again, I am sorry for sloppy quoting. I meant to say that primogeniture
<br>
maintains large estates. Sorry for the confusion.
<br>
<p><pre>
----
<p>But, by construction, the society you're talking about is capitalist.
It has a free market, respect for property rights, and initiation of
force is a no no.  Also, the process of accumulation in your model is
supposed to be that the people on their toes stay on top.  If this is
so -- and how is this any different from other models of capitalism in
action -- why would one expect vast estates to only grow and never
decline?  How could one guarantee that a guy who is competent would pass
that competence along to his heirs?
<p>### You can hire a smart but poor supervisor, give him a good cut (but not
enough to be a competitor). You buy not only farmhands, you also buy the
brains to control them.
<p>Vast estates will sometimes fail, too, and will be devoured by their
neighbors, making them even bigger.
<p>----
&gt; This is orthogonal to the issue of land concentration - land is
&gt; expanded only if there is population pressure,
<p>Wrong!  Land is expanded when it becomes economical to do so -- or, even
more accurately, when some people think it will be economical to do so.
(Entrepreneurial action is based on perceptions and expectations -- not
necessarily underlying realities.  That's why some projects fails.)
<p>### It becomes economical only of there is incresed demand for the land's
products - food, fiber. This demand appears only with increased population
(so called inflexible demand).
-------
<p>&gt; land at competitive prices - entrepreneurs cannot make money by
offering
&gt; cheap &quot;land&quot; in skyscrapers to undercut the traditional landowners
<p>They can if it becomes profitable to do so.  Right now, it is not
profitable to do so -- or no one has found a way to make it so.  (After
all, the price of land could rise to make other methods more profitable
or the cost of other methods -- even formerly unknown ones -- could
decrease, or some combination of the two could come about.)
<p>### Why didn't it happen here on Earth (except if you have gov't
intervention - like in Japan, or Europe, where marginal land is developed
thanks to artificially high food prices). No, in a real capitalist economy
that kind of waste would not happen. If you have large estates producing a
lot of food, the demand for land will not grow in this way, because the
price of food from such artificially developed land would not be
competitive.
<p>------
<p>&gt; (as
&gt; opposed to memory chip makers being able to flood the market with
every
&gt; new advance in technology). Marginal land sometimes offers a refuge
for
&gt; subsistence farmers, but with enough pressure even they might end up
&gt; being displaced.
<p>This is only your assumption here.  There are also other things to do
with land aside from farm it.  Unless you assume only farming is allowed
and that no one can find other profitable uses for land, then your model
has other flaws in it.
<p>### What else can you do with land in an agrarian economy?
<p>------
<p>In essence, if you make a model with enough assumptions in it -- however
unrealistic or unlikely they may be -- you can get just about anything
you want.  This is how, e.g., we get Keynesian economics.  (For
criticisms of Keynesian macroeconomic models, see Roger Garrison's _Time
and Money: The Macroeconomics of Capital Structure_.  I specifically
brought up Adam Smith's corn economy as such a model.  Granted, Smith's
model is not all that bad, but when taken too seriously, it can lead to
results we never see in real world economies, even in farm economies.
He abstracted away from the richness of real world economies.  From
this, Marx was basically able to build his highly unrealistic model of
capitalism, which is very close to your model.  That's why I brought
this up earlier.)
<p>### The only unrealistic assumption I made was the absence of government.
Everything else was kosher. And Marx' conclusions from his model are almost
diametrically opposed to mine.
