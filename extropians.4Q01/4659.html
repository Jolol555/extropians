<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree,
<br>
I am far from the person I was 10 years ago, even 5 years ago. The thought 
<br>
processes and subsiquent actions of my former self are different to mine now. 
<br>
Even in the physical sense, I am a different person, with cell 
<br>
death/replacement and recalcification of bones there is probably very little 
<br>
if any of that physical person left. But I am still me, a me that evolves 
<br>
through the intergration of new expierience and knowledge.
<br>
<p>My basic drives are the same, as are my interests. I would imagine that a 
<br>
large part of that is due to genetics and would not change a great deal 
<br>
throughout my life even if that spans to 1000 years. My 'fasination factor' 
<br>
in any given thing may become lower through time due to greater understanding 
<br>
of the thing. This has been the case so far. For example a computer was a 
<br>
thing of wonder when I first saw one. Now a computer is just an everyday 
<br>
beige box that I understand the in's and out's of, but this does not detract 
<br>
from my interest in such things.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cant see my basic drives and interests changing greatly unless the 
<br>
physical wetware is changed or manipulated. This would change my thought 
<br>
process and would undoubtably change &quot;who I am&quot; and the way I think.
<br>
<p>If I could bring my past self to the present and delete my own memory back to 
<br>
that point. If the two models of me were given a test would they score the 
<br>
same ?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past model would probably have More memory because it still 
<br>
remembered things the present model had forgotten.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present model would theoretically have slightly better wetware 
<br>
than the past model due to the additional years of honing the thought process.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two models were set opon the world with all there memory up to 
<br>
that point intact, but only with a 30 minutes of short term memory. which 
<br>
would fare better in the world ?. I would say the older present model. If 
<br>
that was the case then the older model has gained something through his years 
<br>
despite his lack of memory and his life was still worthy of existance.
