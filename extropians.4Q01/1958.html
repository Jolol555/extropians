<p><em>&gt;...I didn't say that Samantha was arguing well, or that she was being
</em><br>
rational, or that she was being polite.  I said that I didn't think it was
<br>
necessary to go easy on her because no matter what I said or did, or any
<br>
of you say or do, I don't expect it to shatter her psyche.  That's a real
<br>
compliment, but it doesn't mean I think she's perfect, or even good - it
<br>
means what it says, and nothing more.&lt;
<br>
<p>I didn't think this was an issue. Your sentiment was expressed clearly and understood by me, at least.
<br>
<p>I thought that your comment on the expertise of others, and yourself, who you believe have studied rationality (thus, rational thinkers) was inapposite.  I disagreed with this aspect of your post because of the reasons I stated and, especially, in my follow up post on &quot;rationality with a little 'r'&quot;.
<br>
<p>best,
