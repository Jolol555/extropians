I've been expecting something like this, but it's still shocking to
<br>
actually see it. A reader review dated 10/21/2001 on Amazon.com for A Fire
<br>
upon the Deep says the reviewer is not convinced that the Blight is evil,
<br>
and explicitly compares the plot to the present day situation, implying
<br>
that he's not convinced the 9/11 terrorists are evil. Here's a quote: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the Westernized World, we tend to see good vs. evil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a basic tenant of life. Obviously Vinge is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exception and weaved this philosophy throughout this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel. Blight... Bad, Countermeasure... good (even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though it plunged the known universe into a new &quot;dark 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age&quot;). Mr Steel... Bad, Woodcarver... good (even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though she experimented on herself, her own people and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offspring; and was singularly responsible for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation of every Tine antagonist in the book). The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book is guilty of simplifying complex issues and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimizing the importance of understanding the end 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results and responsibilities of any and all these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions. 
</em><br>
<p>What could explain the mindset that would produce this kind of thinking? I
<br>
think in some social circles there must be a kind of competition (which
<br>
historically may have served some useful purpose) to see who can be most
<br>
skeptical of popular beliefs and values and most tolerant of foreign
<br>
beliefs and values. This competition caused an arms race in which people
<br>
found increasingly more effective methods to train themselves to behave in
<br>
this very unnatural way. The end result is a group of people who are
<br>
overly skeptical and tolerant, and don't necessarily realize why they
<br>
behave this way. Would it help to point this out to them, I wonder?
