</em><br>
<p><p>This isn't quite right.  Adding noise increases the noise floor in exchange
<br>
for reducing quantization distortion.  The improvement in signal quality is
<br>
more apparent than real.  The human brain has an easier time rejecting noise
<br>
than correcting quantization distortion, so adding noise to mask the
<br>
distortion is a cheap solution.  In practice, sufficient bit depth will
<br>
eliminate quantization distortion and there is no good reason not to use
<br>
sufficient bit depth in many cases.  Therefore, adding noise is only
<br>
valuable when reducing the dynamic range of the signal to a level where the
<br>
quantization would become perceptible.  The noise serves only to mask the
<br>
quantization distortion, it does not correct it.
<br>
<p>A concrete example is the audio CD, which uses 16-bit encoding.  At 16-bits,
<br>
there is enough quantization distortion that the human ear can detect it.
<br>
However, most recording these days is actually done at 24-bits, which has
<br>
sufficient dynamic range that there is no detectable quantization; at
<br>
24-bits, the theoretical dynamic range is hitting the practical noise floor
<br>
of our environment at the atomic level.  Therefore, the 24-bit signals are
<br>
&quot;dithered&quot; (the technical term) down to 16-bits, minimizing the apparent
<br>
quantization distortion by adding noise that our brains can automatically
<br>
filter out.  The real effect is the reduction of the effective dynamic range
<br>
of the signal, but the apparent effect is a reduction of quantization
<br>
distortion.
<br>
<p>Note that this is a problem specific to digital recording of analog signals.
<br>
Analog recordings have a high noise floor already (analog signals are
<br>
equivalent to about 12-bits of digital in high end analog systems) and
<br>
therefore are dithered by nature; the signal gently disappears underneath a
<br>
sea of noise.  Digital conversions have a much lower &quot;self-noise&quot; floor, and
<br>
therefore quantization distortion is more noticeable as the system doesn't
<br>
produce enough noise to mask the quantization artifacts at the lower
<br>
extremes of its dynamic range, pretty much by definition.  Dithering makes
<br>
the digital system behave like an analog system with respect to noise, while
<br>
still retaining the extremely high S/N that digital systems can support.
