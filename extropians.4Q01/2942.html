Robots dive in quest for weather secrets of seas

By Michael Byrnes
<br>
<p>SYDNEY-- High-tech robots able to dive to two kilometers are being sent to the
<br>
seas in an underwater weather mapping campaign which could help spare remote
<br>
villagers from famine as well as guide torpedoes to deadly accurate hits.
<br>
<p>Australian scientists are at the forefront of a global drive to tap the
<br>
secrets of the seas through free-floating robots, after a successful two-year
<br>
trial of 10 of the sophisticated instruments off the northwest coast of
<br>
Western Australia.
<br>
<p>&quot;A revolutionary international ocean monitoring system has been confirmed,&quot;
<br>
said Craig Macaulay of Australia's government-backed science agency, the
<br>
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).
<br>
<p>Around 3,000 of the floating, diving robots will be placed by 13 nations in
<br>
the world's seas, including the Southern Ocean which swirls around the
<br>
Antarctic, over the next five years.
<br>
<p>The 1.5 meter-long cylindrical aluminum floats, valued at around $15,600 each,
<br>
are sub-sea equivalents of weather balloons, drifting with currents at depths
<br>
of two kilometers, surfacing every 10 days to send their data.
<br>
<p>The information, beamed to super-computers via satellites, will provide
<br>
virtually continuous mapping of sea currents, temperatures and salinity, for
<br>
the first time.
<br>
<p>Near real-time accuracy will be precise enough to tell submarine commanders
<br>
whether to fire that torpedo or whether invisible water conditions will make
<br>
it a wasted shot. There will be applications for shipping, oil drilling,
<br>
marine safety and rescue and fisheries, Australian scientists say.
<br>
<p>(Yet Another) REVOLUTION
<br>
But potentially the biggest payoff will be use with atmospheric data to better
<br>
predict major weather events, including El Nino/La Nina phenomena which have
<br>
killed and devastated communities over ages with droughts, floods and fires.
<br>
<p>&quot;In our world it's like a revolution that we're going through,&quot; scientist
<br>
Neville Smith of Australia's Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre told
<br>
Reuters.
<br>
<p>Smith established the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) which
<br>
has been conducting Indian Ocean trials between Christmas Island and
<br>
Australia's Northwest Shelf.
<br>
<p>&quot;In a year we'll have the same amount of information on salinity as we've
<br>
collected in our history. It's that big leap for salinity which has a lot of
<br>
people very excited,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Salinity dictates how oceans interact with the atmosphere, on short time
<br>
scales with El Nino events which cause wild swings in rainfall, and on long
<br>
time scales for climate change, he said.
<br>
<p>Subsea weather maps -- which GODAE aims to produce within 24 hours of
<br>
receiving data -- would greatly increase the certainty of predictions of
<br>
weather events, such as El Ninos, and ocean patterns, used by offshore
<br>
drillers and in coastal management.
<br>
<p>&quot;The biggest impact is that it will introduce some certainty into greenhouse
<br>
discussions and El Nino forecasts,&quot; Smith said.
<br>
<p>POWERFUL CURRENTS
<br>
The first 10 floats were placed in October 1999, followed by seven more in the
<br>
Pacific Ocean between Western Samoa and New Caledonia in July this year
<br>
jointly by Australia and the United States, and deployment will speed up over
<br>
the next two years.
<br>
<p>Britain will place floats in Antarctic waters before the end of this year,
<br>
Japan will put floats into the Indian Ocean within six months, India will
<br>
follow with more floats after that.
<br>
<p>About 900 floats will cover the Southern Ocean, which Smith describes as ``the
<br>
oceanic engine-room driving global climate.''
<br>
<p>Canada, China, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, South Korea, New
<br>
Zealand and Spain are also involved in the $15 million a year program.
<br>
<p>The trial floats deployed by Australia had already helped reveal how powerful
<br>
currents flowing from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean north of Australia
<br>
spawned huge ocean eddies 600 kilometers across, said CSIRO oceanographer
<br>
Susan Wijffels, manager of Australia's robotic floats project.
<br>
<p>Scientists had learned that weather across western and southern Australia was
<br>
linked to patches of warm and cool water in the Indian Ocean, producing an
<br>
interaction known as the Indian Ocean Dipole, a cousin of the El Nino effect
<br>
in the Pacific.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
