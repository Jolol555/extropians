<p>Ah, sorry, I missed the original context here.  The problem is that
<br>
&quot;simultaneously&quot; means different things in different frames of reference. 
<br>
If quantum entanglement or other instantaneous communication sends a
<br>
message to a distant spacelike-separated event according to the space of
<br>
simultaneity of the originating event, then you can use it to send signals
<br>
into the past.

<em>&gt; These ideas about communicating with the past via exceeding light speed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Andrew Clough is stating a recognized fact of modern physics.  Signalling
<br>
across spacelike separation leads to global causality violation unless you
<br>
assume a single absolute space of simultaneity, which is even worse than
<br>
allowing global causality violation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is an absolute frame of reference in at least one dimension. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, we all know the Big Bang occured at some point in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Temporally speaking, therefore, we can all deal relativistically with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other in reference to the Big Bang event, so in the dimension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, there IS an absolute frame of reference.
</em><br>
<p>All observers agree that the Big Bang occurred a certain Minkowskian
<br>
interval ago on your worldline.  They disagree about how much &quot;time&quot; it
<br>
took.  Everyone agrees that the Big Bang is in the past light cone because
<br>
that's a Minkowskian fact.  You can't use that fact to orient everyone to
<br>
a single space of simultaneity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We may experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more time than others due to our relative veolcities (even then, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of temporal passage occurs in reference to actual zero velocity.
</em><br>
<p>Um... no, not really, although I can see how you're tempted to say so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is an interesting question to ask: Just what frame of reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results in the fastest possible passage of time?
</em><br>
<p>That depends on your frame of reference.  The &quot;fastest possible passage of
<br>
time&quot; is always in the frame of reference identical to your own, at least
<br>
as you measure time.  If you're on a ship travelling at .99c and we orient
<br>
the frame of reference so that you're motionless, then someone who leaves
<br>
the ship in a pod, decelerates to be at rest with reference to the fixed
<br>
stars, stays that way for a week in his reference frame, and then
<br>
accelerates to catch back up with the ship he left, will experience less
<br>
total subjective time than someone on board ship who didn't experience any
<br>
accelerations.
