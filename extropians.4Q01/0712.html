<p>Like I said that won't work. Alice tries to transmit a message, she has an
<br>
entangled particle in her transmitter but she has NO WAY of forcing it to
<br>
be spin up or spin down, it's random. She makes a measurement and
<br>
determines that it's spin down , only now does she know that the particle
<br>
in the receiver a billion light years away must be spin up, but that sends
<br>
no information to her partner Bob a billion light years away because neither
<br>
knew that before they parted and were in communication so no code
<br>
could be set up.  All Bob knows is that he looked at the particle in his receiver
<br>
and saw that it was spin up, but that tells him nothing, there was a 50% chance
<br>
of that happening anyway. A change has been instantly made to a system far
<br>
away but there is no way to make use of that fact to send Morse code because
<br>
the sender has no way of sending a dot with 100% probability or a dash with 100%
<br>
probability as with a telegraph, instead there is a 50% probability of sending a dot
<br>
and a 50% for a dash. In other words, all the receiver will get is noise.
