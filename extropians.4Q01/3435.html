The most recent episode of &quot;South Park&quot; seems to indicate that the
<br>
writers are regulars at Slashdot, if not this list as well.  Remember
<br>
our discussion of &quot;IT&quot; or &quot;Ginger&quot; a few months back, the invention of
<br>
Dean Kamen that was hyped to death?  Last Wednesday's episode of South
<br>
Park on Comedy Central featured an invention by one of the characters
<br>
called &quot;IT.&quot;  It was a gyroscopically stabilized motorcycle consisting
<br>
of one big wheel.  This, for those of you who haven't heard, is in
<br>
reference to Dean Kamen's invention of the gyroscopically stabilized
<br>
wheelchair, and his patent on a gyroscopically stabilized scooter which
<br>
is hypothesized to be the &quot;IT&quot; project.  The character on the show
<br>
revealed his invention to a room of computer technology big-shots,
<br>
including Bill Gates, which parodies the press release that described a
<br>
meeting between Kamen, Steve Jobs, Bill Joy, and others.  In the final
<br>
piece of hard-hitting comic absurdity that has come to characterize this
<br>
show, the &quot;IT&quot; invention is demonstrated to be powered by several rods
<br>
inserted into various orifices on the body.  Dean Kamen has also done
<br>
work on the Stirling Engine, which can create mechanical energy from
<br>
heat.  It is thought that his Ginger invention could involve such a
<br>
power source, and the writers of South Park simply provided a possible
<br>
heat source.  This episode, at least, is worth checking out.  I
<br>
apologize in advance for exposing some of you to televisions most
<br>
vulgar, but entertaining, show.
