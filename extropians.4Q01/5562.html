<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Faulty conjecture and bad memetic engineering. If some extropians are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Libertarian and others Republicans, some Democrats, some are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a-political, and still others non-party line thinkers, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; above-statement is an untenable generalization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Back when I first heard about extropians, one of the major attractions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;me was the combination of transhumanism and libertarianism.  In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that's how I thought of extropians -- as libertarian transhumanists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?  
</em><br>
<p>Because I am unaware of any other defining trait of extropians, as distinct
<br>
from all transhumanists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because some extropians are libertarian would you think that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a personality trait of all extropians?   
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I don't think of libertarianism as a personality trait at all.  I 
<br>
think of it as a worldview, preferably one that has been chosen because 
<br>
of its consistency and reflection of reality (or how reality seems to the
<br>
libertarian, anyway).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I'm not sure what distinguishes extropy from plain transhumanism, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;advocacy of non-statism.  Can someone help me out here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good question.  Actually, basically nothing other than a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Extropy&quot;.  Now, if we begin to unravel some of the history of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism got stated you would learn that there were Upwinger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanists, Transhumanist Artists and other smaller groups of futurists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who felt aligned with the transhumanist futurism.  But, really, the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ideas were first generated in the extropian community.  The word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism came out of the extropian philosophy.  Not the other way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around.  However, FM-2030, wrote his view of what a transhuman is and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that his &quot;ideology&quot; was significantly transhumanist.  
</em><br>
<p>I'm guessing you mean to say, &quot;significantly extropian&quot;, as that would neatly
<br>
wrap this up.   If not, I don't understand what you do mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There was no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political spin on transhumanism other than FM's views ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; globalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In any case, cryofan didn't mention any parties, and in fact used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His inference was pretty darn strong.
</em><br>
<p>It didn't seem so to me.  Perhaps he'll correct me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;By the way, I imagine that &quot;a-political&quot; could easily be used to describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;libertarianism. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure. I guess so.  Frankly, I think political parties are old world.
</em><br>
<p>We agree on this, at least.
