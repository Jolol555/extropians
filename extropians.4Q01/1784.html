<p>Which goes to show that being a doctor of neurology doesn't make you an

evolutionary psychologist.
<br>
<p>ERROR 514: group selection hypothesized

<p><em>&gt; &gt; with the environment. The best part of all was when he described the neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pathways between vision and emotional salience, in the segment about David,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the man with a condition called Capgras Delusion. He knew who and where he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was, but he was sure that the people who said they were his parents were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imposters. Dr. Ramachandran says David's injury destroyed pathways for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emotional information, and since he didn't feel the appropriate emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; toward his parents, he concluded that they were lying look-alikes. (Reminder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to uploaders: Don't forget to include the enteric nervous system.)
</em><br>
<p>There is NO WAY in HELL that Capgras's Delusion routes through the enteric
<br>
nervous system.  Temporal lobe damage would be my guess.
<br>
<p>Molloy, every time you use the words &quot;enteric nervous system&quot;, your
<br>
apparent IQ drops another 10 points.  These are not magic words.  Use the
<br>
magic words &quot;limbic system&quot; instead when talking about emotions.  You'll
<br>
still sound like you picked up all your neurology from pop science tracts,
<br>
but at least you won't sound like a raving lunatic.  Lest you think I
<br>
exaggerate, what you just wrote above is, neuroanatomically speaking,
<br>
something along the lines of:  &quot;Scientists have hypothesized a new form of
<br>
neutron star called a 'magnetar'.  (Reminder to space travelers:  Don't
<br>
run into one of these things on your way to the moon!)&quot;

<em>&gt; So can we draw the following conclusions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Up until recently, the DEMM (deep emotional meaning manufacturing) chunk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the mind was a positive factor for society overall. While it led to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the development of religions which became rather rigidly enforced on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, this also allowed the society to remain stable, which probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed science and technology and trade etc. to grow. Societies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals without this hardware must not have been as stable.
</em><br>
<p>Error 514 - you have to explain how this hypothesized DEMM hardware caused
<br>
a specific individual to have a larger number of surviving grandchildren. 
<br>
Furthermore, the hypothesized DEMM hardware has to be an advantage in the
<br>
absence of any previous DEMM hardware in other tribemembers, or there's a
<br>
chicken-and-egg problem.
<br>
<p>Also, why are we assuming that emotional meaning, especially of the type
<br>
hypothetically involved in Capgras's Disorder, and the God Module, are the
<br>
same piece of hardware?  Is there fMRI evidence?  I hypothesize that if
<br>
you took an atheist patriotic libertarian (but not an exceptionally bright
<br>
or self-aware one), and checked the hardware that lit up while meditating
<br>
on the Constitution or Liberty, it wouldn't be the same hardware as the
<br>
God Module.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I'm not sure that their explanation for Capgras's Disorder
<br>
is the right one.  I'd be more inclined to guess a hardware route for
<br>
linking visual identifications to social/persona identifications.  Damage
<br>
the link and the result is someone who looks just like the person but is
<br>
identified as a stranger.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. Unfortunately, this same DEMM hardware is now very dangerous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.
</em><br>
<p>Half the brain is dangerous in one way or another, and I can think of at
<br>
least three more dangerous modules offhand:  The rationalize-flawed-idea
<br>
module, the them-and-us module, and the ends-justifies-means module. 
<br>
(Assuming that these are single modules.)
<br>
<p>There isn't really any good way to deal with this - for individuals,
<br>
maybe, but not for whole countries.  You just go on.
