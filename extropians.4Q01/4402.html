<p>
Amara,
<br>
<p>Thank you a lot for this post.  It is very valuable to have a
<br>
perspective
<br>
on what is happening here from outside.  Especially from someone
<br>
who both
<br>
knows the US as only a citizen can and has been away long enough
<br>
to note
<br>
the differences more starkly since 911 than those who have been
<br>
here 
<br>
throughout the fallout from this tragedy.  A few comments on
<br>
sections are
<br>
below.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, I observed a transformation in America, that frankly scared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me. It's there now, and is trickling outside. Fear, suspicions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes paranoia. Boundaries and borders are being heavily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fortified, civil rights are being trampled right and left, and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most part, I didn't hear people complaining about that (the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exception was the the ~1000 people who are held in jails with no due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process for 'suspicious terrorist activity'). In human history's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most wretched times,  people were labeled and then burned,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quartered, persecuted, and I see this kind of fear-based labelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on people appearing again. I couldn't escape the feeling that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place where I was born and lived for most of my life (the U.S.) has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone a little bit insane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  This really freaks me out.  Most of the population seems
<br>
to be
<br>
giving in to fear and to be successfully manipulated by the
<br>
powers that
<br>
be to go along with whatever is proposed as long as the magic
<br>
wand of
<br>
&quot;stopping terrorism&quot; is waved.  It doesn't matter if what is
<br>
proposed
<br>
will really stop terrorism at all.  Just wave the want - push
<br>
the big
<br>
red Fear button - and the people will bless you even if you run
<br>
roughshod
<br>
over them.  This is hideously dangerous and *very*
<br>
&quot;anti-American&quot;.  As
<br>
Americans who understand the importants of human rights, rights
<br>
not because we
<br>
are citizens but because we are humans.  It is actually very
<br>
un-patriotic and
<br>
anti-American to not speak out against the gross abrogation of
<br>
rights and 
<br>
the overriding of our Constitutional protections and checks and
<br>
balances.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Before I moved out of the U.S. ~4 years ago, I was, in a small way, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pacifist, believing that one doesn't answer violence with yet again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more violence. I also believe that any group's rampant unhappiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or disrest has an element of truth embedded, and it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed in a civil way, or the violent cycle will continue. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events since September 11, and my U.S. observations the last weeks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have polarized me (unexpectedly) much more as a pacifist, and I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now that the U.S. is not a good fit as an environment for me to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or to raise a kid).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Before 911 I wasn't a pacifist.  Now I am becoming a staunch
<br>
believer in
<br>
non-violence, at all levels right down to speech and thought. 
<br>
Why?  Because
<br>
I do not believe there is escape from terrorism without escaping
<br>
from the
<br>
automatic reaching for violence whenever sufficiently provoked
<br>
or threatened.
<br>
I do not believe that a violent response will address what
<br>
fueled these specific
<br>
or any future terrorist actions.  I believe it will in fact lead
<br>
to more terrorism, 
<br>
including our own.  Also, without embracing non-violence I would
<br>
have to
<br>
prepare to defend my own rights with violence as my government
<br>
has clearly imho
<br>
declared that it will not stand up for my rights and will
<br>
happily overturn them
<br>
in secrecy and with no accounting whatsoever whenever its
<br>
current czar believes it should.
<br>
If I accepted the premise of violence being a healthy tool right
<br>
now I would be
<br>
arming myself to the teeth and digging in, frankly.  I also feel
<br>
that it is very
<br>
important to remove the seed of xenophobia and of dividing the
<br>
world into us vs.
<br>
them if we are to have a future, much less a happy and viable
<br>
one.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't know if my observations are useful to anyone in the U.S. and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't entertain arguments or debates, since they are mostly my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations. I'll only state that I'm very worried with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction that the U.S. humans (and others) on this planet are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Me too.  Again, thank you for sharing this.
<br>
<p>- samantha
