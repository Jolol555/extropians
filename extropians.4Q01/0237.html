<p>
Like most of us I've been watching a lot of TV news this past month.
<br>
One of the new features on the news networks is continually streaming
<br>
text across the bottom of the page, reporting breaking news and current
<br>
developments.
<br>
<p>It can be distracting and confusing to have two separate sets of reports
<br>
going on at once, the text stream and the video news.  I am generally able
<br>
to follow it although sometimes my attention gets grabbed by one or the
<br>
other and then I miss something.  Luckily I normally watch with TiVo so it
<br>
is easy to hit the backup key and see the previous few seconds over again.
<br>
<p>I can't help thinking that this is an example of the Flynn effect
<br>
in action.  Flynn is the one who first discovered that IQ scores have
<br>
been steadily rising over the course of this century.  The effect is
<br>
controversial but it seems to be gradually becoming accepted.
<br>
<p>Today's young people grow up in a multitasking world.  My daughter
<br>
usually has at least ten windows open on her computer.  She'll read a
<br>
bit in one page and then switch to another.  The very act of surfing the
<br>
web involves a form of serial multitasking, pushing one context onto a
<br>
mental stack and switching to a new one, going many layers deep before
<br>
finding your way back.
<br>
<p>Kids do their homework while watching TV, listening to music, surfing
<br>
the web, chatting online or on the phone.  There are always two or three
<br>
things going on.  To them the idea of just doing one task until it is
<br>
done and then starting another seems intolerably boring and unstimulating.
<br>
<p>CNN Headline News switched over to a multitasking format this past
<br>
summer and got criticized by reviewers who found it hard to follow.
<br>
Obviously they were from an older generation unused to the mental
<br>
gymnastics which young people find so easy and natural.  Now all of the
<br>
news networks are using similar presentations.
<br>
<p>I think the networks' reasoning is that you're less likely to switch
<br>
away when they've got an interview or background report on.  You can
<br>
continue to watch and feel confident that if something important happens,
<br>
you will see it on the text stream.  But this only works if viewers feel
<br>
comfortable with the amount of information being presented.
<br>
<p>Chances are that a generation ago, this style would not have succeeded.
<br>
People were not used to being presented with information in multiple
<br>
streams and it would have been too confusing.  But today people are
<br>
smarter.  They can handle it.  Flynn is confirmed once again.
