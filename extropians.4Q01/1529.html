I think this is mainly cultural
<br>
<em>&gt; thing, there has so far not been any training or even need for it. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are changing, and more and more people seem to be able to run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario planning through their heads quickly and efficiently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It would be pleasant to suppose that it is a cultural thing but I am not so
<br>
sure. The fact that people from different cultures across the world does not
<br>
demonstrate that it is a cultural thing, any more than the fact that people
<br>
from different cultures across the world exhibit perfect pitch demonstrates
<br>
that perfect pitch is a cultural thing. And even if it is a cultural thing,
<br>
it may not be as malleable as we like. The accent one has is a cultural
<br>
thing but not completely malleable for most people after a certain age,
<br>
similarly we might worry that the current educational system, for the most
<br>
part, does not see scenario planning as a form of understanding worth
<br>
pursuing. Ideally, I suppose, we should be enrolling our children in
<br>
transhumanist kindergartens. What was it that the Jesuits used to say? &quot;Give
<br>
me a child until he is 15 and he is mine for life.&quot;
