<em>&gt; BTW, one of these days soon, I'll be writing something I thought I'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushed by my friends to write sooner -- a defense of my endorsement of state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action in the present crisis, given my vocal libertarianism in the past ...
</em><br>
<p>As one of your aspiring friends, let me try to explain reluctance to push you
<br>
to write said defense by saying that your endorsement of state action in the
<br>
present crisis seems quite in line with libertarianism. After all, the
<br>
homicidal religious fanatics who perpetrated the 9-11 atrocity are as much (or
<br>
more) the enemies of libertarians and extropians as they are enemies of the
<br>
state.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
