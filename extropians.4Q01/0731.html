<p>Well, lets take a sample, where we have two BECs that are separated from
<br>
each other (they were once the same BEC). Normally, at any given moment,
<br>
you have a 50-50 odds on its spin being in one state, however when you
<br>
observe it, it remains in the state you observed for the period of time
<br>
it is being observed.
<br>
<p>So I am trying to send you a '1' bit as opposed to an '0' bit. When you
<br>
are listening, you are observing every few planck time units, while I am
<br>
observing constantly. You record a pattern of UUUUUUUUUU in your
<br>
observations, which is a rather low probability series of observations
<br>
if the other end is not being observed (i.e. randomness), but if it is
<br>
observed, it is consistent with its state being maintained by constant
<br>
observation. Therefore, a random pattern of observations would mean the
<br>
other end isn't being observed, and a non-random pattern means the other
<br>
end is under constant observation (i.e. its state is being maintained).
<br>
<p>So, therefore, the following series of observations:
<br>
<p>UUUUUUUUUUYUYYUUYUYYUYUUYYYYYYYYYYYUUYUUUYYUYYYUUYUUUUUUUUUUUU
<br>
^--------^              ^---------^               ^---------^
<br>
observing  not observ   observing    not observe  observing ....
<br>
<p>equates to a signal of 10101 being transmitted by the other end. Now,
<br>
there will obviously be bad 'bits' in there, of series of observations
<br>
in the same state for a number of consecutive observations, but this is
<br>
consistent with any noisy low bandwidth medium. The longer consecutive
<br>
number of observations that is set as a standard bit 'time' obviously
<br>
cleans things up but causes lower bandwidth, and you could also have to
<br>
deal with 'tell me three times' error checking or other error correction
<br>
schemes.
