<em>&gt; Brings to mind Pico Della Mirandola's grand vision:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At last, the Supreme Maker decreed that this creature, to whom He could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give nothing wholly his own, should have a share in the particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endowment of every other creature. Taking man, therefore, this creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of indeterminate image, He set him in the middle of the world and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spoke to him:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ``We have given you, O Adam, no visage proper to yourself, nor endowment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properly your own, in order that whatever place, whatever form, whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gifts you may, with premeditation, select, these same you may have and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possess through your own judgement and decision. The nature of all other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures is defined and restricted within laws which We have laid down;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, by contrast, impeded by no such restrictions, may, by your own free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will, to whose custody We have assigned you, trace for yourself the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lineaments of your own nature. I have placed you at the very center of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world, so that from that vantage point you may with greater ease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glance round about you on all that the world contains. We have made you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a creature neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order that you may, as the free and proud shaper of your own being,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion yourself in the form you may prefer. It will be in your power to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descend to the lower, brutish forms of life; you will be able, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own decision, to rise again to the superior orders whose life is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divine.''

<p>Brings to mind Christ's conversion to Islam:
<br>
<p>JERUSALEM-In a surprise announcement with far-reaching theological
<br>
implications, Jesus Christ The Nazarene, founder of Christianity and spiritual
<br>
leader of nearly two billion people, revealed Monday that He has converted to
<br>
&quot;the one true religion&quot; of Islam.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controversial announcement has sent shockwaves through religious
<br>
circles around the globe.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Allah is the name of the One and Only God,&quot; Christ said. &quot;Allah has 99
<br>
beautiful names: He is known as The Gracious, The Merciful, The Beneficent,
<br>
The Creator, The All-Knowing, The All-Wise, The Lord Of The Universe, The
<br>
First, The Last and many more. He has revealed Himself unto Me through the
<br>
holy words of the blessed Qur'an, and I have put My trust and faith in Him.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of His conversion, Christ said He has taken a new name, Isa Ibn
<br>
Maryam al-Salaam Christ Shabazz.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, 33, is urging Christians worldwide to renounce His former
<br>
religion of Christianity and join Him in embracing the Muslim way of life.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;People of all nations, in the past, you have heard Me say that
<br>
whosoever shall believe in Me shall not die, but have eternal life,&quot; Christ
<br>
said. &quot;But now, I say unto you, forget I ever said that. There is only one
<br>
holy revelation of Allah, the Qur'an, which was dictated to the Prophet
<br>
Mohammed, Praise Be Unto Him, by the Archangel Jibreel in the seventh century
<br>
after I died.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Christ, the beauty and perfection of the Qur'an's Surahs
<br>
are without equal in all creation, encompassing and surpassing both the Judaic
<br>
Torah and the New Testament Gospels of His apostles. The former Christian
<br>
messiah went on to cite Surah Aal'imraan 3:67, which reads, &quot;This day I have
<br>
perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen
<br>
for you Islam as your religion.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What could be more clear?&quot; Christ said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was wrong, and I know that now,&quot; He added. &quot;I deeply regret any
<br>
problems or confusion I may have caused.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controversial retraction of two millennia of Christian doctrine has
<br>
provoked strongly divided reaction. Millions of devout Christians, insisting
<br>
that obeisance to Christ's commands is the cornerstone of their faith, have
<br>
heeded His instructions and converted to Islam. Millions more, however, have
<br>
decried the recalcitrant Christ's apostasy, breaking ties with Him and calling
<br>
His conversion &quot;a heathen act&quot; of &quot;utmost blasphemy before Himself.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jesus, or Isa Shabazz, or whatever He's calling Himself these days, is
<br>
the way, the truth and the light. It says so in the Bible,&quot; said devout
<br>
Catholic Kathleen Langan of Cork, Ireland, kneeling toward Mecc
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
