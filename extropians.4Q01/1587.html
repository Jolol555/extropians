<p>I think there are some problems with this.  I get really annoyed
<br>
when I download a program and it turns out not to do what I
<br>
really wanted it to do.  Its a waste of my time to explore
<br>
the program and a waste of the net bandwidth to download it.
<br>
One can say the same about music -- if its a &quot;good&quot; song or
<br>
movie then the time expended to download it is worthwhile.
<br>
If not then it has no wealth-creation effect.  So whether
<br>
downloading creates wealth depends in large part on the
<br>
probability of whether what you are downloading will make
<br>
you &quot;feel&quot; wealthier.
<br>
<p>I'd also dispute the fact that &quot;money doesn't care whose
<br>
hands it is in because that doesn't create wealth one
<br>
way or the other&quot;.  There is a big difference in the
<br>
wealth creation capacity of 1 cent in the hands of 200
<br>
million people and $2 million in the hands of a single
<br>
individual.  There is also a big difference between
<br>
$2 million in the my hands and $2 million in Madonna's
<br>
hands (at least from an extropic perspective).
<br>
<p>IMO, you need to be careful with this because I do not
<br>
believe many &quot;markets&quot; have the intelligence that most of
<br>
the people on this list have.  The people on this list
<br>
can reasonably evaluate the tradeoffs between an SUV
<br>
in the garage and solar cells on the roof.  I seriously
<br>
doubt most market players are capable of that.
<br>
<p>Whether people will be willing to pay in the future to
<br>
have the entertainment industry executives review or recommend
<br>
artistic works based on whether the download *will* be
<br>
valuable to me remains to be seen.  However if we get
<br>
into that mode it may turn out very well -- everything
<br>
produced will be a &quot;hit&quot; for the audience it is being
<br>
made for.  Whether a million fans will band together
<br>
and offer up $1 each for a &quot;new hit&quot; from Artist X we
<br>
cannot tell at present.
<br>
<p>I agree that models will change but I question where
<br>
the dust will settle.
<br>
<p>Robert
