<p>Don't have to bash them, mostly, just don't turn them on. Pop the appropriate breakers.

<p>Getting best delivery on this stuff is tricky. There are a ton of variables.

Still air near early morning has its points. SO much depends on the agent.

VX is very different from our old buddy chlorine, etc.

<p>Gee, why not drop 5 or 10 Large for a Gen III+ image intensifier or FLIR? :)

<p>Simpler than that. Blind the pilot. VERY doable. Mount them on tallish buildings.
<br>
<p>Of course, there are obvious countermeasures, but they don't work well for
<br>
NOE flight.
