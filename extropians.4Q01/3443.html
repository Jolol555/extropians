Hello all,
<br>
<p>I'm new to the list, though I've been lurking for a while. Though my
<br>
background is in the arts I am increasingly interested in the scientific
<br>
world view and that's why I am here.
<br>
<p>I am strongly aware of my ignorance in scientific matters, particularly in
<br>
this company, but am keen to learn.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'll venture my first post:

</em><br>
<p>Whilst it's true that the British government was democratically elected in
<br>
1812, it is worth bearing in mind that roughly fewer than 1 in 5 males could
<br>
vote then and some of the constituencies (rotten boroughs) had very small
<br>
voting populations; Old Sarum had a total of 7 voters!
<br>
<p>Throughout the 19c, the franchise was extended with 3 Reform Acts (1832,
<br>
1867 and 1884), but it wasn't till 1928 that women got voting on a par with
<br>
men.
<br>
<p>To call a government a democracy when more than 50% of the adult population
<br>
can't vote is stretching the term beyond recognisability.
<br>
<p>As far as I remember, before the 20c the word democrat was often employed as
<br>
a term of abuse rather like &quot;commie&quot; is today.
