Come on.  After beating that stupid ad hominems thread to death,
<br>
people still carry on?
<br>
<p>To keep my message on topic:  &quot;men are generally more prone to many
<br>
types of crime&quot; is as nonsensical as &quot;women are generally more
<br>
prone to automobile accidents&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are lies, damned lies, and then there are statistics.
<br>
<p>Even if I agree with Samantha, and say &quot;yes, biologically more
<br>
prone to crime&quot; I'd have to qualify it with &quot;because they're
<br>
more prone to have to provide for women who aren't much more
<br>
than baby-makers.&quot;  That's evolution for you -- men by nature
<br>
have to provide for their resource-consuming spouses and
<br>
offspring, even if that means crime.
<br>
<p>And, women are more prone to automobile accidents according
<br>
to statistics because they spend more time on the roads, so
<br>
statistically they will obviously have more accidents.  Men
<br>
are busy 8+ hours of the day at work, or committing crime,
<br>
while the women are out driving around spending all that
<br>
damned money.
<br>
<p>Go figure.  I can't wait until this transhumanist thing
<br>
takes off, so we can get beyond this money nonsense.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Men are also prone to many types of leadership. This has been noticed for

</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Since you apparently hate men, back into the Blocked Senders list you go.
