<p>Even in that case, this becomes useful.  This powersuit (powered, hard
<br>
shelled suits) aka &quot;mechanized armor&quot; or &quot;mecha&quot;) could become the
<br>
basis for our new bodies - or, at least, physical avatars when we need
<br>
human-like bodies to interact with the world (more of a factor at
<br>
first, when only a few have uploaded and the world is still built to
<br>
human scale and capabilities).  Oh, and if they manage to seal it
<br>
against biochem warface, and *especially* if they rad-harden it to give
<br>
some anti-nuke defenses?  Hello, spacesuit, much more usable than
<br>
what's currently deployed.  (Spacesuits seem to be heading more and
<br>
more towards non-powered hard shelled pressure suits, or &quot;hardsuits&quot;
<br>
for short, though there is not as much need up there for the motors
<br>
that turn a hardsuit into a powersuit.)
