Friends,

<p>--- &quot;E. Shaun Russell&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20List%20Rules%20Part%201%20(Was:%20Ad%20hominem?%20I%20think%20not.)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20011122194321.662.qmail@web13502.mail.yahoo.com&gt;">e_shaun@extropy.org</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt; &gt;The list supposedly has rules...

<p>&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, no one has contacted me directly regarding any
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Consider this a direct contact and formal request for
<br>
corrective action.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Threads about improving the list pop up a few times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each year, but the general consensus has always been
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; that the current method (hands off except for in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme circumstances such as the gun discussion   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moratorium in '99) is the best.
</em><br>
<p>I question whether this is, in fact, the consensus. I
<br>
call for a formal poll of the list participants to
<br>
determine what the consensus is, and, more broadly, I
<br>
recommend that all members of the list community step
<br>
up to the plate and take a more active role in
<br>
promoting a higher standard of
<br>
behavior/courtesy/respect/maturity.  Specifically, a
<br>
more active role in enforcing rule number one:
<br>
<p>&quot;PERSONAL ATTACKS: We do not allow personal attacks or
<br>
libelous statements. Those violating this rule may be
<br>
removed from the List without notice.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;The responsibility for the destruction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;reputation of ExI...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the list rules (which I will send separately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after this message), there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a disclaimer that &quot;...Extropy Institute does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take responsibility for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the use or misuse of posts addressed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians list.&quot;  
</em><br>
<p>Shaun, cmon, the disclaimer is irrelevant.  I would
<br>
guess that people come to the list, check out the
<br>
discussion, and, right or wrong, draw a conclusion
<br>
about 'extropians' and the Extropy Institute.  Loss of
<br>
reputation is real.  It is serious, it is substantive,
<br>
and it is difficult to assess.  Paul Hughes, having
<br>
reached his limit, quit the list sometime back,
<br>
reporting that his friends viewed the extropians as a
<br>
bunch of fascists.  How many others have similarly
<br>
come and gone, invisibly?  Too much of this loss is
<br>
the result of abandoning our forum to the noisy
<br>
predominance of those who cannot or will not treat our
<br>
commons, and our fellows, with respect.  Not fascists,
<br>
just jerks.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If anyone has an issue with the way I have done my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job, please let Max and I know.
</em><br>
<p>You're a decent and responsible chap, Shaun, and I
<br>
can't dump this on you.  So allow me to amend my
<br>
previous comment, where I said:
<br>
<p>&quot;The responsibility...[belongs with]...the list owners
<br>
and their failure to insist on and enforce a standard
<br>
of respect for the discourse in this forum.&quot;
<br>
<p>The responsibility rests with me and all those who,
<br>
seeing a problem, did not act sooner to try and fix
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Finally, I want to emphasize that the solution to this
<br>
problem need not be draconian.  For instance--one
<br>
possibility-- it could be as gentle as intercepting
<br>
and returning an offending post with a recommendation
<br>
that it be redrafted. 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
