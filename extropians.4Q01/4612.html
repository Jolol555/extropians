<p>Yes, I'm also a big map fan. My father collected maps and atlases, and
<br>
deliberately put maps around the kitchen table so me and my brother
<br>
could learn the world. Every six months he switched maps to ensure that
<br>
we saw the same things. Since he preferred the maps of the &quot;real
<br>
world&quot;, my brother and I got the maps from National Geographic
<br>
magazine of the planets and stars to put in our room. I can still
<br>
remembering lying in my bed and thinking about trips across the
<br>
martian landscape in the southern highlands towards the mysterious
<br>
crater Edom. 
<br>
<p>A good map is not a representation of physical reality, but rather
<br>
something that links different aspects of reality together by shared
<br>
location. An ordinary map shows physical reality in the sense of
<br>
landforms and human structures, as well as the cultural reality of names
<br>
and borders. More interesting maps show further aspects: geology,
<br>
climate, ethicity, languages, genes, history and economy. What really
<br>
shows the skill of a mapmaker is to combine the many layers into
<br>
something understandable and beautiful. After all, a map is a kind of
<br>
story about what the world is and how things fit together.
<br>
<p>What map projection is the &quot;best&quot;? Of course none - they all have their
<br>
different uses. The Dymaxion map has a point, but it has also limited
<br>
itself in its uses. But one map projection is the truest: a globe. It is
<br>
only the limitations of paper that has forced us to make projections of
<br>
what truly is an S^2 surface. I dream of having a powerful 3D GIS where
<br>
I can project all kind of information, from mantle plumes to current
<br>
geopolitcal boundaries to freedom-of-press indices to weather to
<br>
satellite orbits. That would be a grand map, but it still would require
<br>
a mapmaker to turn it into art or something as coherent as the real
<br>
world.
