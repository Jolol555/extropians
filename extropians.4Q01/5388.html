James Rogers wrote (in response to kai Becker)
<br>
<p>.  Since weapons have been widely
<br>
<em>&gt; available in the US for centuries, natural selection has weeded out most
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the weapon toting people with control issues.  Consider, for example, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regions of the US where lots of people carry pistols and nobody gives it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second thought (e.g. some of the rural western States, where guns are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried for utilitarian purposes).  Guns are everywhere, but there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blood in the streets.  In fact, the streets are quite safe.  People with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-control issues were removed from the gene pool a century ago in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts.  They've ended up with a well-armed but safe and friendly
</em><br>
environment
<br>
<em>&gt; instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would seem to follow then, that you couldn't just reintroduce pistols
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; cities and regions that haven't had them for a few generations without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expecting some initial bloodshed.  In all likelihood those areas have had
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; buildup of sociopaths and people with questionable self-control, so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial conditions for reintroducing personal weaponry would not be at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equilibrium.

<p>This is an interesting hypothesis but I doubt natural selection could work
<br>
fast enough among a human population to produce such a shift in behaviour. I
<br>
think it's more likely to be a matter of cultural evolution. There is wide
<br>
variation in the level of homicides with guns both within the U.S. (as you
<br>
say) and between the U.S. and other societies with high levels of gun
<br>
ownership such as Switzerland. Historically a major feature of the move to
<br>
modernity is a change in the pattern of recorded crime, from one where
<br>
violent crime makes up a large part or even the majority of the courts'
<br>
business to one where violent crime is a small element (and declines in
<br>
absolute terms as well). This seems to be associated with the disapearance
<br>
of an &quot;honour culture&quot; where ones social status is greatly affected by your
<br>
response to slights to your honour or &quot;face&quot;. Fail to respond to an insult
<br>
to your own or your families' honour with violence or the threat of it and
<br>
your name is mud. I think widespread gun ownership can produce high levels
<br>
of violence given certain cultural norms, very low levels given a different
<br>
set of norms. Steve Davies
