<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we had a family outing, the dreaded Christmas shopping trip. ;o(
<br>
For several weeks now my Wife and I have been discussing whether to get a 
<br>
Robot Dog , as a sort of silly present for ourselves. We were drawn to the 
<br>
I-Cybie from tiger toys due to the recently &quot;highly reduced&quot; price. £80 down 
<br>
from £180.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we made the purchase and a very weird thing happened. 
<br>
Before, we were talking about &quot;That would be good, dont have to walk it, 
<br>
clean up after it&quot; etc etc. Today going to the checkout and right up untill 
<br>
my wife went to bed a couple of hours ago, I have only seen her this excited 
<br>
at the birth of our children. !
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its like we just brought home another child. Unfortunately this child 
<br>
needs a 10 hour battery charge before you can start to play with it. but to 
<br>
my amasement, My wife asked me to GET HER OUT OF BED ! when the battery is 
<br>
ready so she can see &quot;little D'fer&quot; wake up. D'fer as in D For Dog, if you 
<br>
missed that one. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest I cant say that the excitement is all on her part, I am 
<br>
also very excited, despite not expecting very much from what is in all 
<br>
reality &quot;a not very smart autonomous'ish piece of plastic&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shop we were not the only ones buying one of these techno 
<br>
pooches. Another couple were trying to convince us that the purchase was for 
<br>
their son, I wasn't convinced. His name and age seemed to change during the 
<br>
coversation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the kind of psycological responce the general public has to 
<br>
Robots in the home, I seems all we need to do is make them cute and people 
<br>
will love them like a real pet or member of the family.
<br>
