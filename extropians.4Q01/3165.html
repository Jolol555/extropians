From: &quot;Jacques Du Pasquier&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jacques@dtext.com?Subject=Re:%20Selection%20by%20Migration&In-Reply-To=&lt;01e701c17539$9d8af5c0$715d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">jacques@dtext.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm referring to a disposition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to embark in the unknown with hope to make your situation better.
</em><br>
<p>OK, I understand what you're saying. Does this embarcation constitute
<br>
selection by migration, or does the dispostion to migrate originate in the
<br>
constellation of genetic factors that impact the migratory impulse? IOW, is
<br>
migration part of natural selection, or does natural selection impel migratory
<br>
impulses -- which may ultimately eventuate in our displacing &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
selection with directed evolution?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some risk-taking / self-confidence / taste for the unknown do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in self-selection, but migration does.
</em><br>
<p>Yet migration often entails risk-taking and taste for the unknown, so they are
<br>
interlinked, yes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However good &quot;good&quot; is, it can still be better. You have extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentive to go if your life is bad, but even if it's good you may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempted to make it even better, if that's how your mind works.
</em><br>
<p>Or how your brain works, since that means the same thing.
<br>
©¿©¬
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some kind of convictions may be for some the support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-confidence. You know that everything will be different there --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but at least you can rely on yourself, you know who you are, what are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good and bad, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you may not actually &quot;know&quot; it, but you can feel confident about it,
<br>
yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I was saying is, you can NOW correlate these things. You have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-selection through migration (with the possible pressure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult conditions), and then success resulting, over time, from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected behaviour.
</em><br>
<p>*Potential* success, yes... it doesn't always turn out as we wish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One obvious OTHER FACTOR (for the &quot;success of the settler&quot;) is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everytime you have to REDO something, you have occasion to do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better. So when you arrive in a land with nothing established, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to re-think every single thing, and so you question what you know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you make it better.
</em><br>
<p>Right, that's sometimes called adaptive behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Though on the other hand, one could say that you tend to dismiss too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily things (like social institutions, or moral conduct, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politeness forms) that have grown over time, as you are not able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grasp their intricate usefullness when you redesign things from scratch.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and sometimes the same process can reveal institutions that are actually
<br>
useless and even counterproductive. For example, colonists discovered that
<br>
they could safely jettison the notion of royalty and replace it with the much
<br>
more practical meritocracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can probably also witness this occasional shortcoming in the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society.
</em><br>
<p>Right, and again one can see the occasional benefit to the US of discarding
<br>
obsolete social conventions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may be the source of the impression of naïvety that Europeans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (French at least) sometimes have when examining American behaviour or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discourse. There is a fine line between naïvety and freedom from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition / openness to new solutions.
</em><br>
<p>I find it difficult to believe that Europeans (especially the French) have the
<br>
impression that Americans are naive. Unless you consider that America was
<br>
naive to buy Louisiana from France. Are you suggesting we should have let the
<br>
French who migrated to the Southern States remain French? What do you have
<br>
against American red necks? &lt;g&gt;
<br>
Come to think of it, if France had purchased Quebec, perhaps they wouldn't
<br>
have so much trouble imposing their language in the Canadians. &lt;G&gt;
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
