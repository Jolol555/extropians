Hi Spike,
<br>
<p>I love to watch ants too, and have seen this before. When I was a kid we 
<br>
had a large nest of meat-ants (dunno their proper name -- about half an 
<br>
inch long with red body and black abdomen) near the house which we used as 
<br>
a garbage disposal for all the things that the dog, the local wild birds, 
<br>
and the fish didn't want or couldn't eat. This colony grew and grew. I used 
<br>
to very carefully squat on the edge of the enormous mound and watch the 
<br>
little critters for hours. It always amazed me that they never tried to 
<br>
attack me.
<br>
<p>One day I was walking down the long bush path to the house when I noticed a 
<br>
trail of ants with exactly the qualities you mention. They had cleared a 
<br>
highway in the undergrowth -- astonishing in itself. I followed the path 
<br>
both ways -- to its source and its destination. The source was the 
<br>
enormous, well-fed colony near the house. The destination was a spot some 
<br>
hundred yards away (maybe less). Initially I thought they were migrating, 
<br>
but I realised after the traffic had dwindled and eventually stopped that 
<br>
the colony had split.
<br>
<p>I have often wondered what determined which ants went to which colony. I 
<br>
assume the move was triggered by the colony reaching critical mass and some 
<br>
hormonal trigger causing the split. I wonder if the new queen was produced 
<br>
before or after the migration. I don't think ants are as ummm antsy about 
<br>
having more than one queen as bees or wasps are.
<br>
<p>The complex behavior that ants are capable of in groups is quite 
<br>
enthralling. I wonder how much analogy can be drawn between group behavior 
<br>
in humans and in social insects. Craig Reynolds' classic flocking behavior 
<br>
requires only 3 simple rules:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cohesion: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates
<br>
We can see them at work in any crowd of people.
<br>
Ants have similar simple rules that govern apparently complex behavior. 
<br>
Some work by Chris Langton has uncovered some of these. Craig Reynolds has 
<br>
also worked on them.
<br>
<p>If you like ants, you should see our bull-ants. They are the largest ants 
<br>
in the world -- about an inch long. They have quite small colonies of less 
<br>
than a thousand individuals I believe. There are smaller variants, about 
<br>
3/4 of an inch, commonly called bulldog ants which are considerably more 
<br>
ferocious than the larger ones. Bulldog ants will actually chase and jump 
<br>
at you. All kinds of bull-ants have very painful stings. I have been stung 
<br>
so many times I hardly get any reaction now apart from the initial pain and 
<br>
later furious itch.
<br>
<p>My 2 brothers once watched an army of bulldog ants surround and take a 
<br>
termite mound in all-out war. Wish I had seen that. How the hell they 
<br>
coordinate such maneuvers boggles the mind.
<br>
<p>Happy ant-watching.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

<em>&gt;Today I witnessed something that is baffling the hell outta
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me.  I have been an ant watcher for many years but I saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something today that I have never seen before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When one sees an ant trail, one always sees ants going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both directions, nearly balanced, so that the net ant flux is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approximately zero.  Those who have been to my house
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that I have an integral garden {because it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;raised area with a curved wall shaped like an integral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sign} and an eliptical grass area, golden ratio ellipse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I saw an ant trail going from the integral garden to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ellipse *with a definite direction*.  The ant trail
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had a very high one way flux, perhaps as high as 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ants per second, with only an occasional wanderer going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back the other way.  This was an ant colony that had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suddenly just decided to *move* somewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I saw no obvious food source in the grassy ellipse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I searched but found no reason why the integral garden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had suddenly become the place not to be.  No sprinklers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had come on, no chemicals were released.  I noticed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many of the ants were carrying eggs.  None of the few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;backtrackers had eggs, whereas about a third of the forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movers had eggs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another thing about ant lines is that they do not change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suddenly.  This one did.  Over a period of about 15
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minutes, the ant flux declined from about 10 per second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to nearly zero: the backtrackers remained constant while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the forward goers quickly dropped to about the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the backtrackers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This was a clear case of a colony moving somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but what I dont understand is why, and why now exactly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and how do they signal everybody to grab an egg and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;walk this way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can anyone suggest how to make an instrument which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would watch an ant trail and measure flux?  I need something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can connect to a computer so it can watch all the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while I go to work.  spike

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
