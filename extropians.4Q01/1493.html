<p>&lt;&lt; I know a fellow who has shut down all of his wells, which produce for
<br>
&nbsp;between $8.00-12.00 per bbl, until oil prices drop back to below $20.00
<br>
&nbsp;per bbl. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I hear you, and I understand and appreciate the capitalist notion, and 
<br>
respect it. But not to the point of national survival. I believe national 
<br>
survival, till the world can advance technically, and mentally, enough to 
<br>
handle the Libertarian world-view, is still valid.  
<br>
<p>I have often thought that of nanotech becomes a massively used, and 
<br>
massively, useful, means of production; then the nation-state will take a 
<br>
backseat to a differnt social and economic order. But as of now, it must be 
<br>
someone pushing to pry America from reliance on OPEC oil. Alter the middle 
<br>
east policy as you like it, but come hell and high water, we have to change 
<br>
the OPEC connection.
<br>
<p>-One of my half-ass solutions are, in no particular order:
<br>
<p>-Extraction of oil from heavy oil sources
<br>
-Conversion of natural gas to gasoline
<br>
-purchase of oil from non OPEC nations
<br>
-increased use of ethanol
<br>
-building coal to gasoline plants
<br>
-longer term movement to fuel cells and hydrogen
<br>
<p>-The committment to build new refineries (something not done in the USA in 30 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;years)
<br>
<p>-building of synfuel and reverse cracking plants
<br>
-building of agricultural manufacture of fuel crops
<br>
<p>The sad thing is that it may take another loss of American life, and/or the 
<br>
an oil boycott for America's &quot;war against Islam&quot;, something that will emerge 
<br>
in the the next several months in greater mentionings, iin the Islamic World.
