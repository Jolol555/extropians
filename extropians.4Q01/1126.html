<p>Anyone who thinks an MD has more of a right to live and work wherever
<br>
he wants than does a dishwasher or vegetable picker, or that the latter
<br>
hard-working individual is a burden to society, makes me ashamed to
<br>
admit that he shares my citizenship.  Extropians fight for freedom, and
<br>
you, Sir, have no right to use that word.
<br>
<p><p>You make me laugh!  How about if someone wants to work for your company,
<br>
and you tell them, &quot;I'm sorry, but you need a *graduate degree* to work
<br>
here&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>Wow, Randy, you are the master of the ill-fitting analogy.
<br>
<p><p><p>No, I am the master (?) of the *original* analogy.  And, in my ever-humble
<br>
opinion, you cannot grok them because of their originality.
<br>
You have no answer, because you have seen their like :-)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shouldn't need to point out that people work in jobs that they want 
<br>
and
<br>
are suited to.
<br>
<p><p>Ah, no! You CANNOT be serious! People work in the jobs they WANT to work in,
<br>
and are suited to?  Go to tell it the Burger King girl who graduated from
<br>
beauty school, or the Walmart &quot;Associate&quot; with a newly minted Truck Driving
<br>
School Diploma....
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USA has many openings for cleaners, fruit pickers, MDs,artists, computer
<br>
programmers, etc.,
<br>
<p><p>Yes, and those jobs, and all other benefits accruing to American citizens,
<br>
belong to American citizens, just like my car belongs to its joint
<br>
owners--me and my wife.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for your housing analogy, rental accommodation is roughly equivalent 
<br>
to
<br>
how immigration currently does work.
<br>
<p><p><p>?
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Saying that others are brainwashed because they don't subscribe to your
<br>
xenophobic beliefs and crying the underdog because your anti-human ideals
<br>
inspire disgust doesn't make you right.
<br>
<p><p><p>No, common sense and studies conducted by well-published Ivy League
<br>
economists make me right.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shouldn't have called you a jerk
<br>
<p><p>No, you should not have :-)
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because in a twisted kind of way
<br>
<p><p>Oh, baby, you don't know the half of it!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you see
<br>
that as validating your prejudices. But no matter whether I was wrong in
<br>
allowing my disgust to be voiced, your views are a big mistake.
<br>
<p><p>You wax ever so....prosaic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
<br>
countries that rose to greatness did so as a result of cultural
<br>
cross-pollination... and yes, that includes such &quot;worthless&quot; people as
<br>
fruit pickers, cleaners, waiters, delivery people, clerks, etc.
<br>
<p><p><p>Pure Sentimentality....as trite and maudlin as it comes....a fine grade of
<br>
propaganda and hogwash, straight from the typewriter, written by yuppie
<br>
hacks, such as my own self. Well, OK, straight from word processing
<br>
software--there are no more typewriters.
<br>
<p><p>Miriam, do me a favor:  go look up the immigration criteria for your next
<br>
door neighbor, New Zealand.  Report back at your convenience....
<br>
<p>And by the way, what makes you think &quot;great countries&quot; are the best for
<br>
their citizens?
