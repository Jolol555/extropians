<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There really do exist concepts newly formed _in the mind_, and conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes operating on them that have no foundation in sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input or memory.  They are certainly few and far between, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conjectural nature of science and human advancement depend on them.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mind which is housed in the brain.
</em><br>
<p>Of course; I'm arguing against empiricism, not materialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The evolution of the brain is directly connected to sensory input
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and output.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  That one's not as obvious.  There's also the Baldwin effect to
<br>
think about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's not disregard Popper.  I'm not sure if there aren't a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strata on which to view this subject.  Give some discussion examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newly formed concepts in the mind that have no realtionship to any aspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever of sensory stimuli.
</em><br>
<p>Haven't you ever had the experience of not being able to find the right
<br>
words to describe an idea?  The existence of that experience makes it
<br>
clear that strict Whorfianism is untenable: ideas don't come from words
<br>
(which come from sounds and visual images).  Ideas preceed words, which
<br>
are created to expres them.  That doesn't rule out the new ideas being
<br>
visual or auditory, etc.; so we have to dig a little deeper.  But it
<br>
does show that concepts like &quot;invisible&quot;, &quot;silent&quot;, and &quot;non-existent&quot;
<br>
are not necessarily formed from the experience of hearing or seeing
<br>
words.  Can't a blind physicist argue rationally about sight?  What do
<br>
you suppose a mathematician does when he generalizes a formula?  Does
<br>
he necessarily visualize the formula in some way first, and then
<br>
substitute the image of a variable for a constant?  Of does he first
<br>
think the concepts (not the words) &quot;generalize that 3&quot;, and then perhaps
<br>
later conjure up an image and a variable name to help him remember?  What
<br>
about the built-in concepts an infant has, like &quot;animated&quot;, before he can
<br>
ever experience them?  Can we not conjecture about extraterrestrial
<br>
life without visualizing any particular form or place?
