<em>&gt; Actually the gun design was never used again on any bomb,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's just too crude and inefficient and won't work at all with plutonium.

<p>Obligatory oversharing time--FAS website disagrees (I'm just looking at the USA inventory):
<br>
see <a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html">http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html</a>
<br>
<p>They say there were 5 Mk-1s made and the unblownup ones were all recycled by the end of 1950.
<br>
<p>However, other _fielded_ gun-type weapons listed there are Mk-8, W-9, Mk-9/T-4, Mk-11, W-19, 
<br>
W-23, W-33. They appear to have been intended as simple, skinny, high-ballistic-coefficient 
<br>
devices for artillery and/or earth penetration. 50,000 Gs and up were a tough design constraint.
<br>
<p>Other curiosities:
<br>
-W-48, W-79 and the cancelled W-74 were/are strange &quot;small-diameter linear implosion&quot; Pu gadgets.
<br>
One gathers that they &quot;outgunned&quot; the Pu assembly time problem, and probably used serious T-boosting.
<br>
The W-79 had a dual-mode variant with an enhanced radiation (N-bomb) setting. Don't know how clean
<br>
it really was.
<br>
<p>-The dinky 0.05-0.25 kT Mk-54 Davy Crockett was a spherical implosion warhead, as was the demo
<br>
charge &quot;oil drum&quot; variant.
<br>
<p>MMB (maybe I should collect hubcaps?)

My moronic mnemonic for smart behavior: &quot;DICKS&quot; ==
