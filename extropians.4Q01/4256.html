<em>&gt; &gt; In copying you are disconnecting a sentience from it's I/O
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (sensors/actuators), keeping all its memories, copying it, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reconnecting the copy to it's own set of I/O, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; location. From that instant you have two sentiences on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divergent life-paths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course they are not the same. For in-depth analysis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consult that prodigious journal of wisdom - Red Dwarf,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where Rimmer and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copy of himself gradually diverge from total sameness to completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different to enemies. All in a half hour show.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you (and Rimmer) for providing the definitive analysis of the
</em><br>
Identity
<br>
<em>&gt; Question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
A pleasure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I asked the list a long time ago if anyone had ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'graded' sentience. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never got any reply but I grow more concerned that we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need a system of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; licences to control the creation of sentience beyond a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain level. A true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentience, that knows that it knows that it knows - replete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and values and relationships - should not be allowed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copied/killed/mutated willy nilly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then again, what sentience, that knows that it knows that it knows, would
</em><br>
take
<br>
<em>&gt; it upon itself to dictate which beings should be allowed whatever? The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimate sentience transcends such petty decisions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Us!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The life of the sporadic holo-doctor on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Star Trek Voyager is still a life - can you imagine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; him/her/ve/whatever?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course a fictional story devised for children needs an immature
</em><br>
character
<br>
<em>&gt; to appeal to viewers. Can you imagine a world in which people fail to grow
</em><br>
up,
<br>
<em>&gt; so that they continue to need imaginary characters to complete their
</em><br>
lives?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Guilty as charged, your honour. I'm just a big kid.
<br>
All the sci-fi I've watched has been, to me, a long series of thought
<br>
experiments.
<br>
I use them because most people can relate to them in some way.
<br>
At least I'm assuming that for the people on this list.
<br>
It beats using &quot;XYZ person, Obscure back issue of Journal of Something, ref
<br>
23.4 line 7&quot;  to make a point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is a book - SciFi - Robin Cook...can't remember the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name?? where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans live multiple serial lives in different bodies. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they've burned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out a body they go into a machine. It makes a carbon mesh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy of the brain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they gestate a new body, and grow the new brain with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; original. Voila....immortality. Or is it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds somewhat like a parallel to real life, where children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherit the genetic procilivities of their parents. Some (square) people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of families as a kind of immortality.
</em><br>
A new brain is a blank book, waiting for life's authorship -except insofar
<br>
as those functions pre-coded into the body - the autonomous side (even they
<br>
need a lot of tuning).
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only thing you can say for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sure is that the original human went into the machine quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by choice, happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the knowledge that something good was going to happen. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead body came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out. The rights of the potential sentience in the new body were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; addressed in any serious fashion. Nor were the rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; continued sentience' of the old body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That sounds even more like conventional bio-reproduction. Humans have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalized the continuance of themselves through their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children since humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered that children are similar to their parents. The extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techno-extropic position is Hans Moravec's Mind Children,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from the parents, yet carry on the tradition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children which surpass themselves.
</em><br>
<p>I think we're heading for a morphology/semantics mess re what a 'copy' is.
<br>
Are we talking about the immortality of DNA/MEME or an entire sentience,
<br>
complete with memories?
<br>
genes and memes are 'doing the dawkins dance' and survive by battle savy.
<br>
If I want 'me' to go on, whilst I can make myself feel a little better
<br>
knowing my genes are in my kids, I know it's not me.
<br>
If I want to kid myself i'm immortal I'll get a religion. So many to choose
<br>
from.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whilst in the machine the sentience could still be 'related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to' verbally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; although what they replace all the sensory and organ I/O
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with beats me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This device of verbal relationship provides the magic element that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconnected parent/child evolution lacks. Notice how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intensely, almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desperately, parents try to communicate with their newborn children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It'd be a weird experience. Imagine all those hormone secretion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synapses in the pretend neuron mesh trying to 'squirt' non-existent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hormones into ...what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I digress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The digression is worthy of discussion. Hormone computing has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently emerged as a feasible and potentially very powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool for creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gotta leave now...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we can go into this in more depth later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hormone computing. Hmmm.
<br>
<p>Re the book above - I was talking about what a literal copy of a complete
<br>
brain in a foreign mesh nothing like a body  would be doing with all the
<br>
I/O. A large chunk of brain is all about visual and aural decoding and also
<br>
actuation procedures (=cerebellum). What would this 'mesh' be doing with all
<br>
that?
<br>
<p>I bet it'd be like one of those 'waking anesthetics'. I also bet that, at
<br>
least in a software sense, all the control loops normally driving organ
<br>
adjustments would be in overdrive, trying to control non-existent body
<br>
temperature, for eg. I bet you would feel permanently starved or permanently
<br>
stuffed, food wise. Blind. Numb. No taste. At least in the book you could
<br>
'talk' and 'Hear'. At what position would the mood and emotion settings
<br>
settle? Presumably locked where you were at the instant of the scan. Imagine
<br>
feeling anger or fear permanently (until you rebirth, of course). What would
<br>
happen if, say, you forgot to visit the bathroom before copying? - you'd be
<br>
mentally crossing your non-existent legs for a non-existent pee forever.
<br>
Imagine permanently 'seeing' the internal surface of the scanner (the last
<br>
thing you saw). How 'plastic' is this mesh. Can you learn?
<br>
<p>Tricky stuff, this copying into an artificial environment. We may have to
<br>
copy the environment in as well or replicate the I/O in real-ware.
<br>
<p>*breaks out of train of thought* What am I doing here? I got things to do.
<br>
<p>cheers
