<p>
Today I witnessed something that is baffling the hell outta
<br>
me.  I have been an ant watcher for many years but I saw
<br>
something today that I have never seen before.
<br>
<p>When one sees an ant trail, one always sees ants going
<br>
both directions, nearly balanced, so that the net ant flux is
<br>
approximately zero.  Those who have been to my house
<br>
know that I have an integral garden {because it is a
<br>
raised area with a curved wall shaped like an integral
<br>
sign} and an eliptical grass area, golden ratio ellipse.
<br>
I saw an ant trail going from the integral garden to
<br>
the ellipse *with a definite direction*.  The ant trail
<br>
had a very high one way flux, perhaps as high as 10
<br>
ants per second, with only an occasional wanderer going
<br>
back the other way.  This was an ant colony that had
<br>
suddenly just decided to *move* somewhere.
<br>
<p>I saw no obvious food source in the grassy ellipse.
<br>
I searched but found no reason why the integral garden
<br>
had suddenly become the place not to be.  No sprinklers
<br>
had come on, no chemicals were released.  I noticed that
<br>
many of the ants were carrying eggs.  None of the few
<br>
backtrackers had eggs, whereas about a third of the forward
<br>
movers had eggs.
<br>
<p>Another thing about ant lines is that they do not change
<br>
suddenly.  This one did.  Over a period of about 15
<br>
minutes, the ant flux declined from about 10 per second
<br>
to nearly zero: the backtrackers remained constant while
<br>
the forward goers quickly dropped to about the same as
<br>
the backtrackers.
<br>
<p>This was a clear case of a colony moving somewhere,
<br>
but what I dont understand is why, and why now exactly,
<br>
and how do they signal everybody to grab an egg and
<br>
walk this way?
<br>
<p>Can anyone suggest how to make an instrument which
<br>
would watch an ant trail and measure flux?  I need something
<br>
I can connect to a computer so it can watch all the time
<br>
while I go to work.  spike
