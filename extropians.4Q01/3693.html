&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonids: Imperfect Storm 'Casting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Noah Shachtman
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2:00 a.m. Nov. 28, 2001 PST
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out the scientists predicting meteor showers aren't any more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accurate than the TV talking heads who say when it's going to rain.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four major forecasts of the timing and strength of mid-November's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonid meteor shower &quot;all were wrong,&quot; according to Bill Cooke, a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, who helped make
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the predictions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooke and the other scientific teams successfully predicted when the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meteors would fall, preliminary evidence and eyewitness accounts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggest. It's the intensity of the storms that they got wrong.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Jenniskens, from NASA's Ames Research Center, forecasted up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to 4,200 meteors per hour above North America; the real number was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more like 1,000. Cooke said that there would be an hourly peak of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonid activity near Hawaii of around 1,300 meteors; instead, only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about 300 per hour fell.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We sort of blew it there,&quot; he said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all meteor showers, the Leonids are caused by the Earth passing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the ice and dust left behind by a comet -- in this case, Comet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tempel-Tuttle. Every 33.25 years, Tempel-Tuttle comes close to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sun. The proximity causes the comet to eject a mass of particles.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These particles then form bands of debris that orbit around the sun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Nov. 18, Earth passed through at least three such bands. The ones
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Tempel-Tuttle's solar encounters in 1699 and 1866 went over Asia.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band from 1767 could be seen over North America.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite their less-than-crystal-clear predictions of the Leonid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action, researchers are still heartened by the results. The art of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forecasting meteor showers is extremely young; the first accurate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prediction of a shower's timing came just two years ago, when an 1899
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonid trail passed over Israel.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Before that, no one knew when or where on Earth the shower could be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best seen. We only knew what day it would come,&quot; said the [52]American
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meteor Society's Robert Lunsford.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adds Cooke, &quot;It's only in the last half-decade or so that we've had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the computing power to try these forecasts.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1996, Cooke's colleague, Peter Brown, has been assembling a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer model of 1 million particles from a comet over a 1,000-year
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;period.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from the most recent Leonid shower -- NASA had observers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stationed from Florida to Guam to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specially designed, low-light cameras recording the event -- will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used to enhance the model, to try to make it more accurate. The other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientific teams are also using computer modeling in their work, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they all follow different approaches.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comets remain objects shrouded in mystery to scientists; the core of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comet, for example, was viewed for only the second time ever in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September by NASA's Deep Space 1 probe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest mysteries is why people are not only able look at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meteor showers, but can sometimes listen to them as well.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just walked outside at 4:46 a.m. EST (on Nov. 18) ... and it's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually loud. There's a solid stream of hissing.... Is it possible to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear meteors?&quot; asked Chris Hahn of Lawrence, Massachusetts, in an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-mail to NASA's Spaceweather.com.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stranger still, witnesses are reporting no lag between the sight of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the meteor and the sound of it, as there is with lightning and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thunder.
