<em>&gt; &gt; Then again, our occupation of Saudi Arabia is one of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We lost 6000 people because a religious fanatic has been fighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a declared war against us for years and our government stupidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignored it.
</em><br>
<p>Lets not get sloppy with the numbers in what one hopes is an extropic
<br>
rational discussion.  I believe the body count has been reduced
<br>
to under 4000 at this point.  A not insignificant difference.
<br>
<p>I wish to make a point of notice about Kuwait -- My sources
<br>
suggest Sadaam's attack was launched because of the Kuwait's
<br>
side-drilling into Iraqi oil fields.  (Theft of resources
<br>
can easily be viewed as an aggressive act).  Our ambassador,
<br>
told the Iraqis we wouldn't object if Iraq retook its renegade
<br>
provence without apparently checking with Washington (or
<br>
did check and the superiors at State didn't check with
<br>
anyone at DoD or perhaps the rules may have changed when
<br>
the Saudis realized they had an army on their border with
<br>
a Hitler-in-training calling the shots and they came running
<br>
to us.). IMO, the U.S. &quot;was&quot; on Saudi soil to protect them
<br>
from Iraq.  Right now we are probably on Saudi soil to do
<br>
that as well as protect the interests of the ruling powers.
<br>
We are essentially mercenaries for hire.  The annoying thing
<br>
is that they know we can't leave -- so they get to keep
<br>
throwing the Palestinian issue back in our face knowing
<br>
we are unlikely to respond by washing our hands of the
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>However, there may be hints that the government actually
<br>
knows what it is doing.  The plans for moving the country
<br>
to fuel cell based vehicles are relatively robust as are
<br>
the plans for moving our electrical production to a
<br>
multi-fuel (coal, gas, alcohol, etc.), multi-technology
<br>
systems operating at very high efficiency.  It is doing it
<br>
in a way that is least disruptive to the economy (plants
<br>
being replaced at the end of their normal life cycle) --
<br>
so we will not be off of our oil addiction anytime soon.
<br>
But if push came to shove I suspect the schedule could
<br>
be significantly accelerated.
<br>
<p>Also, I happened to catch part of an interview with
<br>
the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. -- Prince Bandar bin
<br>
Sultan bin Abdul Aziz on a PBS show last night.
<br>
A *very* astute politician.  I suspect he could
<br>
beat most U.S. politicians in an election without
<br>
breaking a sweat.  He made a *very* interesting point
<br>
that the al Saud family had been in power for ~300 years.
<br>
This is *not* a &quot;politically&quot; incompetent group.
<br>
<p>My 2c worth for today.
<br>
