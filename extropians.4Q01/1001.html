<p>The only western artillery shells used by Iraq were actually *Canadian*
<br>
in origin. They were remachined US surplus shells (empty) that were
<br>
modified by Canadian artillery expert Dr. Gerald Bull in Canada and
<br>
exported to Angola and Iraq for use in South African artillery sold to
<br>
UNITAS and Hussein (respectively). The Iraqi versions were armed by the
<br>
Iraqis themselves with home grown warheads. These shells were exported
<br>
by Canada because the US had, and has, laws against exporting such
<br>
munitions and equipment to such nations. The Canadians acted as the
<br>
middlemen, ostensibly in the case of Angola on the behest of the CIA. As
<br>
the saying goes &quot;Blame Canada.&quot;
