</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that there's an improper linkage here; people who argue
<br>
that the age of downloading hath come feel obliged to argue that the age
<br>
of downloading is good; people who argue that the age of downloading hurts
<br>
the artist feel obliged to argue that the age of downloading is a
<br>
temporary effect of improperly encrypted media.  These two issues are not
<br>
entirely orthogonal - if the age of downloading is bad, we might want to
<br>
do something about it, thus reducing the probability of the age of
<br>
downloading continuing - but the two issues are orthogonal to a much
<br>
greater extent than the correlation of presented arguments would seem to
<br>
imply.
<br>
<p>I think that the age of downloading will probably reduce the total amount
<br>
of money that goes to artists, and will certainly produce at least a
<br>
temporary reduction in quality until a new generation of topnotch artists
<br>
willing to work for free arrives to replace the current cream of the crop,
<br>
who have grown up expecting payment.  But I also think that the age of
<br>
downloading has enormously powerful forces behind it, verging on
<br>
inevitability.  Music as material good, as tape or record, is dead.  Now
<br>
it's an informational good and can be copied.  I don't know that
<br>
information wants to be free, but information certainly wants to be
<br>
downloaded.  In the new world, people who want information download that
<br>
information.  If prices are set too high, they will download without
<br>
paying.
<br>
<p>Information wants to be downloaded.  How much to pay for downloaded
<br>
information, or even whether to pay at all, is a choice that has shifted
<br>
from the provider to the consumer.  If tipping infrastructures can break
<br>
the stranglehold of the current power structure, then the choice of how
<br>
much to pay the middleman will shift from the middleman to the artist. 
<br>
The latter effect will reduce the amount paid to middlemen - and the
<br>
former effect will reduce the total amount paid to artists, at least on a
<br>
per-work basis; even if people are willing to spend the same total amount
<br>
as before, cheap artists and free artists will still tend to drive out
<br>
expensive artists.
<br>
<p>Each additional download creates wealth, because information is an
<br>
infinitely duplicable good.  If we all paid exactly the same amount to
<br>
artists and middlemen, but got ten times as much content at one-tenth the
<br>
price per unit, the net effect on industry revenues would be zero, and yet
<br>
an enormous amount of wealth would have been created.  That's why
<br>
information wants to be downloaded.  I don't say it wants to be free, but
<br>
it definitely wants to be downloaded, because each download creates
<br>
wealth.  Whether money gets transferred, and where it goes, is almost a
<br>
side issue compared to downloading; money is conserved, but downloading is
<br>
infinite.  Information just wants you to download it - it doesn't really
<br>
care whether downloading ten times as much information costs you ten times
<br>
as much money, or twice as much money, or the same amount of money, or
<br>
half as much money, just so long as you download.  Information wants to be
<br>
downloaded because each additional download creates new wealth; money
<br>
doesn't care whose hands it's in because that doesn't create wealth one
<br>
way or the other.  But, in real life, I think that this effect will tend
<br>
to reduce total industry revenues - regardless of whether that's good or
<br>
bad for the individual artists, or for the art - because it puts control
<br>
of wealth flow in the hands of the downloaders, and shifts the payment
<br>
motive from &quot;pay for what you take&quot; to &quot;pay for what you copy&quot;, two
<br>
entirely different ethics.
<br>
<p>So I understand that the artists are upset, and that the middlemen are in
<br>
a state of crazed fear, but whatever solutions they try are going to have
<br>
to fit with the two new facts: first, information wants to be downloaded;
<br>
and second, whether information is downloaded is a choice that now lies
<br>
with the downloader.
<br>
<p>There are various things that can be done about the probable decrease in
<br>
artist revenues.  Eliminating middlemen will increase the amount that goes
<br>
to artists.  For those who are willing to put effort into this, I think
<br>
the most leveraged approach is to create tipping infrastructures, with
<br>
tips going directly to the artists, despite the screams this will cause by
<br>
the RIAA and MPAA.  But in the long run, even that is doomed.  Content
<br>
that doesn't request tips will drive out content that requests tips.  I
<br>
don't download shareware anymore because there's almost always an entirely
<br>
free alternative at CNET downloads.  I don't know that this decreases the
<br>
quality of software, but my guess is that it does - although open-source
<br>
may make up for that, and too little time has passed to tell in any case,
<br>
and it was just a guess to begin with.
<br>
<p>But the age of downloading is here, regardless.
