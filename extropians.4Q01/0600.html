I'm keeping the Subject line intact because I want the thread
<br>
to flow through in the archives -- though I think the topic
<br>
has gone off in a very different direction.
<br>
<p>Samantha asked (regarding my comments on the blind beliefs of religions):
<br>
<em>&gt; Is that a blind belief? Scientific validation is not the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to come to what one considers valid and crucially important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think Extropians are required to only find value and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validation by science and not by anything else ever in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspect of their existence.
</em><br>
<p>I'd quote the first paragraph of section 7 of the Extropian principles:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extropians affirm reason, critical inquiry, intellectual independence, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honesty. We reject blind faith and the passive, comfortable thinking that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads to dogma, conformity, and stagnation. Our commitment to positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-transformation requires us to analyze critically our current beliefs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors, and strategies.  Extropians therefore prefer readily to admit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error and to learn from it rather than to profess infallibility. We prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analytical thought to fuzzy but comfortable delusion, empiricism to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysticism, and independent evaluation to conformity. We affirm a philosophy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life but distance ourselves from dogma, whether religious, political, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal, because of its blind faith, debasement of human worth, and systematic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationality.
</em><br>
<p>My comments were intended to speak to *blind* belief.  I.e. belief
<br>
uninformd as to the probability of historical reality and/or
<br>
beliefs that are in conflict with known (accepted) laws of
<br>
physics/chemistry/evolution, etc.  Now, I myself have raised the question
<br>
of precisely *what* Christaian miracles could be accounted for
<br>
by advanced nanotechnology on the extropian list -- so I am
<br>
*not* avoiding explanations that may &quot;rock the boat&quot;.
<br>
<p>There is a distinct difference between &quot;blind&quot; belief and &quot;experiential&quot;
<br>
belief.  I believe those differences to be significant.  However
<br>
&quot;experiential&quot; belief must deal with &quot;consentual&quot; belief (presumably
<br>
the scientific reality).  In the face of significant evidence to
<br>
the contrary -- I am going to trust that my senses may have experienced
<br>
a misperception rather than go against commonly accepted scientific
<br>
principles.  I will none-the-less place those scientific principles
<br>
on trial for examination with regard to their validity.  That I
<br>
believe is the Extropic path.  If what one has experienced is
<br>
in conflict with the generally accepted reality then one should
<br>
place the whole body of evidence on trial.
<br>
<p>If it turns out we are in a simulation and &quot;personal&quot; experiences
<br>
can be manipulated at the whim of those running the simulation, then
<br>
one might expect the development of significant dichotomies in
<br>
personal experiences.  In that event. the confirmation of ones
<br>
experiences as being valid would become increasingly justified.
<br>
If such justifications prove increasingly difficult, then
<br>
assumptions regarding the actual reality of this environment
<br>
should be called into question and appropriate reponses taken.
<br>
<p>Tonight, I have no idea &quot;what&quot; precisely such responses should  be.
<br>
<p>Robert
