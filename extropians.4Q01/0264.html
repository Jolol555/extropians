<p><em>&gt;But by our standards, when the CIA with little or no oversight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and using secret funds goes to various countries and topples
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their elected governments using a variety of means including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those which cannot be termed other than terrorism, torture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assasination, sabotage and so on - is this somehow not criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but a reasonable function of the government?
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems to me there is a bit of a double standard here.  As bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as WTC was we have been involved in covert operations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries we were not at war with, even in countries we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposedly friends with that are every bit as horrendous.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of our secret operations resulted in much higher loss of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and property. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see anyone defending either the CIA or Bill Clinton here.
<br>
<p>We were involved with the deliberate murder of thousands of
<br>
innocent civilians? Facts please....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Does it enter into anyone's head along with chest-beating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;righteous anger that some of the anger and venom directed toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us is not without cause?  Do we understand that our rhetoric is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;roundly condemning as utterly beyond the pall actions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;portions of our own government have committed, are committing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plan now to commit even more egregiously?  Some of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposed as curative would include a variety of even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ambitious covert activities around the world and even within our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own borders by some of these same players and any undesirables
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they may see fit to influence, use or recruit. Have we learned a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damn thing from the history of using such methods?  Does anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem a bit cockeyed about this sort of &quot;solution&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>The fact that people don't like us is hardly just cause.
<br>
<p>The world is full of people with 2 bit excuses to &quot;hate&quot; America,
<br>
I quite frankly am more than a little tired of it. Go ahead and
<br>
hate us if you have nothing better to do, but we are going to make
<br>
it very clear that attacking us carries the ultimate price.
