</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one does not take &quot;actions&quot; then one can only loosely be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By this argument, it would seem that Mr. bin Laden is nowhere near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as guilty as the pilots of the recent planes turned into bombs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has supplied funds to and trained terrorists but has not

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that from the &quot;action&quot; perspective that conspiracy to commit

</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism themselves.  And yet we now know that conspiracies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can cause a much greater loss of freedoms than any single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act of terrorism.
</em><br>
<p>I think you have a point here, but at the same time I wonder if from a
<br>
ethical point of view there is a significant difference in culpability.
<br>
<p>Traditionally humans have always punished/rewarded leaders for the
<br>
results of their subordinates, which were presumably due to the leaders'
<br>
efforts. But is this suitable for ethics? It seems that it is more a
<br>
question of how much of the ethical subjecthood of the subordinates the
<br>
leader has acquired than being a leader or planner. 
<br>
<p>Let's imagine two simple special cases. In the first case bin Laden
<br>
telepathically mind-controls his men to perform the attacks. They have
<br>
no free will, no ethical subjecthood. In this case the culpability would
<br>
rest solidly on bin Laden, and the men would actually be regarded as
<br>
victims. 
<br>
<p>In the other special case they acted completely out of their own free
<br>
wills, with no control from bin Laden and support only in the form of
<br>
advice and resources they could choose to follow or not.  They had free
<br>
will and could at any point have selected a different course of action,
<br>
which implies that they are responsible for their actions. Here
<br>
culpability is solidly on their shoulders. If you start blaming bin
<br>
Laden in this scenario for the original idea, then you should also blame
<br>
all authors and movie directors for all actions their works cause.
<br>
<p>In reality the situation was somewhere in between: the terrorists were
<br>
to some extent coerced into the acts (by having their families hostage)
<br>
and had apparently closed minds that had been partially &quot;programmed&quot; by
<br>
bin Laden (or rather, his followers). I would still say they had free
<br>
will and were culpable, but there is also a transfer of guilt here
<br>
through the coercion (which corresponds to bin Laden taking a certain
<br>
about of freedom from them to himself) and possibly (but this is far
<br>
more tricky) due to the mental &quot;programming&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my action perspective bin Laden is indeed not as guilty as the
</em><br>
bombers, although he is severely guilty. They had a partial choice and
<br>
did not make the ethical choice. He largely caused the situation, but
<br>
the actual execution was left to ethical subjects. If that doesn't
<br>
appeal to the standard human reaction, that does not have to be a
<br>
problem with the ethical perspective. I also wonder if the practice of
<br>
putting the blame on the evil planner rather than the people doing
<br>
things isn't risky because it seems to absolve the doers too much; maybe
<br>
it would be better to show that you do get punished from following
<br>
bad orders?
<br>
<p>Note that we run the risk of ending up in a messy debate here about what
<br>
we mean with freedom and free will. I think this is an area we need to
<br>
study more closely in terms of a transhumanist concept of ethics and
<br>
humanity, but at the same time I right now lack the time to do it
<br>
properly. It is also extremely important from a political perspective:
<br>
when we claim we are supporting the free self development of humanity,
<br>
what do we really mean by that? 
<br>
<p>Some definitions of freedom (such as the marxist) claim that you are not
<br>
free if there is any form of coersion, need or incentive involved. Which
<br>
turns even the most libertarian situation into a power struggle -
<br>
of course means that the issue becomes to chose the right kind of
<br>
coersion rather than escaping coercion altogether. 
<br>
<p>What should the extropian definition of freedom be?
