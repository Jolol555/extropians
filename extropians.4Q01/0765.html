<p>Experts Say Spotting Terrorists Messages Online Is Mission Impossible
<br>
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/DailyNews/webwatch011011.html">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/DailyNews/webwatch011011.html</a>
<br>
Watching the Web for Wicked Messages
<br>
Evidence is mounting that the terrorists responsible for last month's attacks
<br>
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were technically sophisticated -
<br>
communicating with each other via encrypted messages hidden within digital
<br>
images sent via the Internet.
<br>
<p>To follow that electronic trail, the FBI and other investigative agencies
<br>
might have relied on sophisticated Internet monitoring systems such as
<br>
Carnivore - a set of computers and software that can watch for traffic headed
<br>
for a unique Internet address.
<br>
But according to many computer security experts, finding electronic clues to
<br>
prevent future attacks won't be easy - even with all of the technological
<br>
tools available to investigators.
<br>
<p>For one, Carnivore - more officially known as DSC1000 - requires the FBI to
<br>
know a specific suspect's Internet address in order to get a court order for a
<br>
an e-mail wiretap. &quot;You have to know who you're looking for,&quot; said Michael
<br>
Vatis, a computer crime expert and director of the Institute for Security
<br>
Technology Studies at Dartmouth College. &quot;You have to have a subject, not just
<br>
a broad fishing expedition.&quot;
<br>
<p>Employing Echelon - If It Exists
<br>
With such legal limitations on Carnivore, some suspect that another monitoring
<br>
system called Echelon may be in place. Supposedly, the system is run by the
<br>
National Security Agency and can capture electronic signals - fax, phone, and
<br>
computer data - as they travel over international telecommunication satellites
<br>
in space. Computers would then filter out suspected communications based on
<br>
&quot;keywords&quot; such as &quot;bomb&quot; or by matching a particular voice-pattern in phone
<br>
calls.
<br>
<p>The NSA won't comment on the capabilities - or even the existence - of
<br>
Echelon. But experts doubt that even such a super electronic spying system, if
<br>
it does exist, would be able to catch every suspicious message.
<br>
<p>&quot;Real-time monitoring of the Internet of all communications its not possible,&quot;
<br>
says Dave Lang, director of training and forensics with Veridian, a computer
<br>
network security firm in Arlington, Va. &quot;The volume of data would require the
<br>
largest of supercomputers. There's just too much data.&quot;
<br>
<p>Lang, a former special agent in counterintelligence for the Air Force, says he
<br>
couldn't comment if there was indeed a project called Echelon within the
<br>
global intelligence community. However, he says, the system that some describe
<br>
Echelon as being wouldn't be possible.
<br>
<p>A Picture or a Plot?
<br>
Even if Echelon exists and functions as some suspect, other computer security
<br>
experts say that terrorists and criminals can further hide their incriminating
<br>
messages within the daily flood of computer data with common - but difficult
<br>
to crack - encryption software.
<br>
<p>&quot;Encryption, as the government has been saying for years, is getting much
<br>
better,&quot; says Vatis, who was the first director of the federal National
<br>
Infrastucture Protection Center. &quot;And if they use strong encryption, the
<br>
government can't break it.&quot;
<br>
<p>To further complicate matters, the coded messages may have then be hidden
<br>
within digital pictures - a process known as  steganography. And since
<br>
steganography doesn't alter the physical appearance of the picture, there's no
<br>
easy way to spot a steganographed image on the Internet.
<br>
<p>Some security groups are trying to develop tools to combat steganography.
<br>
Colin Rose with IoMart, a network security firm in Glasgow, Scotland, says
<br>
that most steganographed images have certain unique file characteristics - an
<br>
extra bit of data, say - that may tip off investigators to be suspicious.
<br>
<p>But with thousands of steganography programs - each with its own means of
<br>
encrypting messages into files - available on the Internet, Rose says it's
<br>
impossible to know every single &quot;signature&quot; tip off. &quot;There's no easy answer
<br>
for law enforcement, unfortunately,&quot; says Rose.
<br>
<p>Staying Hidden in Plain Sight
<br>
Even if fool-proof countermeasures against steganography and other electronic
<br>
encoding tricks could be developed, some experts say terrorists and criminals
<br>
have other ways to communicate hidden messages in plain sight.
<br>
<p>The recent requests by National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to American
<br>
news agencies to edit or limit broadcasts from Osama bin Laden, for example,
<br>
is partly on the suspicion that certain phrases may be cryptic messages to his
<br>
followers to initiate new attacks.
<br>
<p>And according to Eugene Spafford, director of the Purdue Center for Education
<br>
and Research in Information Assurance and Security at Purdue University,
<br>
there's no technological solution to monitoring seemingly innocuous messages.
<br>
&quot;If they are using conversations like 'Oh, I'll get that package to you,' how
<br>
would you know what they are talking about and find it,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;/media encryption&gt;
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
