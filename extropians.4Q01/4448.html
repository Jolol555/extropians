<em>&gt; The joy of seeing  so called experts trying to refute their conjectures,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's more like scoring a point in a sport, or even winning a chess a game,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then achieving a noble
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree with your description about what drives us scientists (although
<br>
there are other motivations too), but not your separation of ethics from
<br>
science. Moral philosophers are experts on ethics, but that doesn't mean
<br>
you should hand them the right to define what is desirable! Leon Kass is
<br>
a moral philosopher, and he thinks immortality and posthumanity are
<br>
evils to avoid. If I as a scientist (or a human) leave the definition of
<br>
desirability up to others, then *they* will rule my mind and actions.
<br>
Instead, I want to be able to stand up to others and be able to clearly
<br>
explain why my research is not just enjoyable to me, but something that
<br>
is both ethically allowed and desirable. When somebody asks me why they
<br>
should spend money on my research, I want to be able to show them not
<br>
only that it is useful, but that it is *right*. 
<br>
<p>It is this tendency to leave ethics to the ethicists that has
<br>
contributed very much to the current anti-GM situation. The scientists
<br>
did their research, not noting that the ethics being defined in society
<br>
was being co-opted by anti-progress groups. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a moral philosophy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism an A+.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't. Here is an experiment: try to deduce from transhumanist
<br>
ethics, what forms of animal experimentation should be allowed. If you
<br>
can deduce this from the transhumanist moral philosophy (and not just
<br>
include your own or other ethics, calling it the transhumanist
<br>
position), then it may be a workable moral philosophy.
