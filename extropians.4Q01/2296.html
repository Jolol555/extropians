POWER DRESSING
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/opinion/opfeedback.jsp?id=ns231699#29">http://www.newscientist.com/opinion/opfeedback.jsp?id=ns231699#29</a>
<br>
To be a member of the US Special Forces you need to be a crack soldier
<br>
with superior physical and mental abilities. But that's today.
<br>
Tomorrow's soldier will have to be superhuman - to be able to jog along
<br>
effortlessly at 13 kilometres per hour carrying a 70-kilogram load for
<br>
12 hours at a stretch. For anyone wearing the right clothes, however,
<br>
this shouldn't prove too much of a problem. In just four years, and with
<br>
$50 million, the Pentagon plans to create a wearable, self-propelled
<br>
robotic suit that responds to - and amplifies - your every movement. By
<br>
simply strapping themselves into this &quot;exoskeleton&quot;, troops will be able
<br>
to run faster, jump higher, leap further, and carry awesome amounts of
<br>
high-calibre weaponry. We take a look at the &quot;garment&quot; that as well as
<br>
turning your average GI into a heavyweight fighting machine, could also
<br>
revolutionise the lives of disabled people and those working as
<br>
firefighters or in construction, mining and heavy industries.
<br>
Read the full feature in New Scientist magazine
<br>
AND FINALLY...
<br>
Some describe how a wave of sympathy washes over them whenever they see
<br>
a road sign referring to a &quot;depressed bridge&quot;. Others confess that they
<br>
feel strangely moved by the mere mention of an &quot;alarmed door&quot; or
<br>
&quot;nervous tissue&quot;. These people are suffering from semiopathy. This
<br>
week's Feedback column examines a debilitating condition which compels
<br>
its victims to over-empathise with objects...
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
