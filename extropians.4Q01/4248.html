John Clark writes, quoting Michael F:
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; I can be reasonable sure that when I go to sleep at night I don't die for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; few reasons 1) Hooking me up to any kind of machine that measures brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; activity would never measure any absolute cessation in activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in normal sleep but it would under deep anesthesia. When you go to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hospital to have your tonsils removed are you the same man when you walk out?
</em><br>
<p>One of the problems with Michael's position is that it is possible that
<br>
normal sleep doesn't kill you, because as he said the brain activity
<br>
continues, but that deep anesthesia does (supposing that in fact brain
<br>
waves stop during that time).
<br>
<p>His position on identity states that there is a fact of the matter about
<br>
whether any particular instance of consciousness is a continuation of an
<br>
earlier one which successfully retains the same identity.  Certain kinds
<br>
of discontinuities, in this view, break the chain and so the identity
<br>
is not the same.  Other kinds, like sleep or blows to the head, do not
<br>
break the chain.
<br>
<p>The question is, how could you know that severe discontinuities like
<br>
John's anesthesia example, or severe head trauma, don't break the chain?
<br>
<p>It certainly won't work to ask the person afterwards if he feels the
<br>
same, because I think everyone agrees that he would say he does, even if
<br>
in fact the chain of identity had been broken.  Someone who was copied
<br>
without his knowledge would say the same thing, and on this view he
<br>
is wrong, his identity is no longer the same, but he doesn't know it.
<br>
So statements and even personal experience are no evidence.
<br>
<p>If you agree that there is no way to tell if severe trauma breaks the
<br>
chain of identity, and even the person involved can't tell afterwards,
<br>
then how confident can you be that ordinary sleep doesn't break it,
<br>
either?  Your personal experience and memories are no guide.
<br>
<p>Evolutionarily there would be no reason for brains to have evolved to
<br>
maintain &quot;identity&quot; since it has no operational effect in the world.
<br>
A race which unknowingly died every night would be no less successful
<br>
than one which maintained the chain of consciousness from day to day.
<br>
Without evolutionary pressure to maintain the property of identity
<br>
conservation, and with your personal experience offering no evidence
<br>
that it exists, why would you expect it to be true?
<br>
