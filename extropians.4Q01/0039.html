<p>
A freind of my mother just got back from a trip to Florida (by air). On
<br>
the way down, they asked if she had any sharp edged implements, which
<br>
she did, as she had her knitting kit with her, which included a small
<br>
yarn cutter. 
<br>
<p>She had to check that into her baggage, but could keep her knitting
<br>
(along with a selection of 8-16 inch long steel and aluminum pointy
<br>
knitting needles) on the flight. On the way back, she denied that she
<br>
carried any cutting implements and got through security and was on the
<br>
plane without a problem.
<br>
<p>So it seems that the rule against any edged device is as useless a rule,
<br>
which depends on trusting passengers to tell the thruth, as those stupid
<br>
questions they ask you at the ticket counter about your luggage being
<br>
your own.
<br>
<p>Once again, it is evident: the only way to keep airliners safe is to
<br>
either strip and cavity search every passenger, or else arm
<br>
passengers/aircrew.
<br>
<p>Here's an idea: all passengers must remain in straight jackets for the
<br>
entire flight. I bet that would go over like a lead balloon.
