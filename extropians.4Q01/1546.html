<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ray Kurzweil harps on that phenomenon in his writings.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes sense.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Progress has always been on an exponential curve.  But since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the start of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the curve it is flat, even exponential change is barely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticeable.  Now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are fairly well into the curve we are starting to see the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponential nature of technological advance.  My guess is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that within the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next couple decades we will come to expect continual paradigm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances.  I expect we will even come to be comfortable with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our society 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming repeatedly racked with paradigm changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<p>Just a quick point to pick with this...
<br>
<p>Exponential curves are never flat, they are always exponential. No matter
<br>
where you stand on the curve, it looks mostly flat behind, and curves up in
<br>
front. The only thing that makes some curves seem flat at the start is when
<br>
we are fitting discrete events/improvements to a continuous curve.
<br>
<p>For example, the famous speed-of-transport curve which starts off &quot;For a
<br>
bloody long time everybody walked around, until some lucky dude rode a horse
<br>
without getting killed&quot;. That early part of the speed of transport curve
<br>
wasn't a curve at all, it was flat until people started riding, where it
<br>
took a big discrete jump. In terms of the fitted exponential curve at that
<br>
time, the transition from walking to riding was a mammoth technological
<br>
advance; relatively larger than any advance since?
<br>
<p>When you get into parts of the curve where the increases aren't too massive
<br>
in relation to the absolute value of the curve, coming more often perhaps,
<br>
it really feels more like an exponential curve. I think we've got this in a
<br>
number of areas, and that we have already adapted to it. Culturally, we seem
<br>
to be able to take exponential increase in things like computing speed
<br>
completely in our stride; even qualitative advances like the introduction of
<br>
the internet are absorbed very quickly and pretty painlessly.
<br>
<p>So to Zeroes' point above, I think we are already there. Adapting to
<br>
exponential advance means coping with a static paradigm turnover rate, which
<br>
I imagine is proportional to the doubling rate of the curve in question. I
<br>
want to emphasise this point - we seem to be able to cope pretty well with a
<br>
*constant* rate of paradigm turnover. It is really important to note that
<br>
this goes on indefinately - a scenario involving only exponential
<br>
improvement is one which does not have a singularity.
<br>
<p>However, it is proposed by some people that we actually have
<br>
hyper-exponential improvement in many areas; that the doubling time is
<br>
decreasing. That is something to which I don't think a society can truly
<br>
adapt, and which it would most likely treat as exponential improvement, with
<br>
major upheavals every so often as the paradigm turnover rate grows
<br>
(inversely with doubling times) well below what the culture is able to cope
<br>
with, and is assuming. It is conjectured that this kind of environment has
<br>
an asymptote at doubling time = 0; the famous Singularity.
