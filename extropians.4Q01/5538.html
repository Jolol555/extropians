</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a U.S. taxpayer I would object to my funds being given to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign company for this purpose, local workers exempted. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies in other countries want the business/charity work, let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them convince their governments to shell out the Bucks/Marks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peso's whatever.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What do you think foreign aid is?  Do you want us involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indefinitely in Afghanistan and working to spend US tax money at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US worker prices?  That doesn't make a bit of sense to me.
</em><br>
<p>I think we should temporarily be involved in assisting Afghanistan
<br>
with emergency aid, and to rebuild sufficient infrastructure to
<br>
achieve self-sufficiency again. I believe the parts we do agree to
<br>
build with taxpayer dollars should be done by U.S. based companies
<br>
with a combination of imported experts and local labor.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Does that bag of wheat mean that the US does nothing wrong to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;criticized for?  Of course not.  Your logic is empty here and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you come off defensive and angry.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We of course have completely different ideas of what the U.S. has
<br>
done wrong. Based on my premises my logic is accurate. The man in
<br>
question is guilty of extremely bad manners in the very least.
<br>
<p>Yes, after the events of 9/11 I am both very defensive, and very
<br>
angry, and I believe the best defense is a great offense.
<br>
<p>Rabbits hide, tigers stalk...
