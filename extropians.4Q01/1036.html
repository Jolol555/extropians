<p><p>Yes. However, we still have a disagreement. I feel that we need
<br>
to work toward advancing the technology as rapidly as possible,
<br>
to minimize the window during which humans can self-destruct.
<br>
I have no confidence is our ability to affect the SI that results
<br>
from the singularity, but I can hope that the SI will become &quot;good&quot;
<br>
(Elizier's &quot;friendly&quot;) by self-analysis and adjustment. Thus, I feel
<br>
that Elizier's efforts to build in friendliness, and your efforts
<br>
at personal/social transformation, are misdirected. I feel that
<br>
we have no basis for belief that such efforts can affect the
<br>
&quot;morality&quot; of the SI, because the SI is not analyzable by humans.
<br>
By contrast, we have a much better chance at analyzing pre-singularity
<br>
human society, and we can see that there is a non-zero chance of
<br>
pre-singularity self-destruction on any given day. Thus, we should try
<br>
to minimize the number of pre-singularity days.
<br>
<p>I'm working on delivery of a petabit (i.e., &gt;1Pbps forwarding rate)
<br>
router for the internet core. What are you working on? (Genuine
<br>
curiosity, not sarcasm.)
