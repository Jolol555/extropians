</em><br>
<p>Yeah, that ending note annoyed me a bit. He just *had* to finish by giving 
<br>
in to the sensationalist scary aspect. Grrrr!
<br>
<p>I can understand the desire to wind up the show on a strong dramatic point, 
<br>
but geeez! I would have thought the comparison with the changes we have 
<br>
gone through over the last 100 years being dwarfed by the changes of the 
<br>
next 20 years makes for exciting stuff without biased overlay. Let us 
<br>
optimists enjoy our half full glass. Let the pessimists bemoan their half 
<br>
empty one, but there is no need to encourage their fear and loathing.
<br>
<p>But on the whole it was a pretty well rounded show, I thought. And at least 
<br>
he didn't interview any of the hordes of dickheads who think cyberheaven is 
<br>
a sin against god and humanity. (whew!)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Featured players included Natasha Vita More, Stelarc (with his mad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientist laugh), Miriam English, and me, with readings from Greg Egan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fiction.
</em><br>
<p>I was quite pleased that he left in the part of my interview where I 
<br>
pointed out that I like having a biological body, but sadly must leave it 
<br>
behind if I am to live in full health for many hundreds of years.
<br>
<p>He can't really be blamed for using Stelarc's *mwahahahah* laugh. He is a 
<br>
broadcaster -- such a sound bite is an irresistable sweet to them. :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I found the edited excerpts of my long shambling interview with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ian Walker pretty fair. In one place, though, I shruggingly admitted that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to find a suitable analogy to immortal  life (becoming a flower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say) is hopeless; as quoted, this might create the false impression that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;am in despair at the pointlessness of *everything*. Such editing verged, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought, on bad faith.... but luckily it was a rare lapse.
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't *believe* that he actually asked you what is so bad about 
<br>
dying!!! I could almost feel you tripping over yourself in amazement that 
<br>
someone could actually consider death as acceptable.
<br>
<p>The part where you talked about immortality came over almost as a joke or a 
<br>
quip I think.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Oh, and according to Ian Walker extropians have a secret handshake--I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terribly put out, as you'll appreciate, that nobody has ever shared this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Heheheh.
<br>
ACK/SYN packets perhaps. :-)

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
