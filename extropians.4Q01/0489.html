<p>True. It raises the interesting question if there are any other
<br>
analogies that are more suitable? Or is there any aspects that makes NT
<br>
qualitatively different from any other technology? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I wonder if Francis Fukuyama's thoughts on the industrial-postindustrial

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is both interesting and important. 
<br>
<p>Fukuyama's point (I have also just begun his work, so this will be a 
<br>
bit of guessing) is that humans adapt and try to create meaningful
<br>
social structures even when the underlying rules of economy, technology
<br>
and society changes. So if a transition occurs, there will be disruption
<br>
but after a while people will have built a new social fabric. 
<br>
<p>If transitions happen more and more often, it seems they could happen
<br>
faster than adaptation occurs, creating a state of constant disruption.
<br>
Some people likely think this is what has already happened, but I think
<br>
Fukuyama takes a larger picture and views the current situation as just
<br>
the reaction to a single transition in the later half of the 20th
<br>
century. But our &quot;standard&quot; future model of faster and faster rate
<br>
leading up to a singularity would imply such a situation of constant
<br>
disruption.
<br>
<p>One factor that could change this is if social adaption could be speeded
<br>
up. I don't see any obvious tech fix for this, at least not until we
<br>
develop some form of cognitive technology or really efficient net based
<br>
community building. But there could simply be an adaptation process
<br>
among humans a la the Flynn effect: maybe the ability to create new
<br>
social structures when needed is something that can be trained by being
<br>
in a state of flux and especially by having media such as the net to
<br>
experiment on? 
<br>
<p>This links to the issues of what kinds of socio-economic systems could
<br>
support this. Clearly they have to be adaptive and pluralist, in order
<br>
to allow the exploration of new possibilities. At the same time they
<br>
need to have enough structure to fullfill their functional duties. This
<br>
suggests that the level of adaptability need to be somehow regulated to
<br>
fit the rate of change in some dynamic way. The issue is a general
<br>
learning problem deep down: how to select the learning rate to maximise
<br>
the local benefit as well as ensure that the system is able to always
<br>
remain adapted to the environment.
