<em>&gt; Thoughts? Comments?
</em><br>
<p><p>I would not focus on &quot;hate&quot; : this may appear as hate to you, but
<br>
that's not what it essentially is.
<br>
<p>As human, we have a large programmable part. We can entertain diverse
<br>
ideas and let them influence our natural behaviour.
<br>
<p>In fact, these ideas can be VERY unnatural, and we can take them VERY
<br>
seriously. Call this &quot;radicality&quot;.
<br>
<p>Programmability and radicality are not bad per se. But they account
<br>
for religious fundamentalism, sects, science (it is indeed radical and
<br>
far from the natural life -- which doesn't mean of course that I put
<br>
in on a par with religion according to other criteria, truth for
<br>
example), extropian quests, and many courses of actions that appear to
<br>
most people as unnatural or even mad.
<br>
<p>And of course, more simply, the person may have plain old good reasons
<br>
for being angry, that you cannot / don't want to understand (so you
<br>
blind yourself and say : why all this hatred ??). Take ben Laden :
<br>
he's annoyed at the presence of US military bases in Saudi Arabia. The
<br>
fact is, the US impose them, and as they have &quot;good intentions&quot;, they
<br>
don't see the problem. But it's a constraint, it's a force thing. So
<br>
if someone says : I don't fear the US, and I don't want them to mess
<br>
with my country, and he attacks the US, this is actually simple to
<br>
understand. Think William Tell.
<br>
<p>This results from the fact that the interests of two parties, as they
<br>
perceive them (and sometimes as they really are), may happen to be
<br>
incompatible. You may try to find an agreement, or you may
<br>
successfully impose your force.
<br>
<p>You may also change the way people are made so that they are, not
<br>
individuals pursuing their interests, but part of a big
<br>
world-individual, like social insects, and pursuing the world's
<br>
interest. When you have an engineer look on the world, I think you
<br>
cannot help but seeing that evolution has produced individuals that
<br>
are in intrinsic conflict of interests, and that they are not very
<br>
good building blocks for a peaceful world.

<p><p>P.S.: I wrote an essay related to 9/11 and more, however it's in
<br>
French (and part of it is specifically directed to French people) :
