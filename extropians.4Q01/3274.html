<em>&gt; &gt;Furthermore, I don't regard Hiroshima or Nagasaki to be primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;terrorist acts. By late in the war, both the German and Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;governments had so thoroughly mobilized and armed their societies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;preparation for invasion of their home territories that the only people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;there that could be considered 'non-combatants' under the Geneva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Conventions were those in POW camps and patients in hospitals.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Fooey.  Japanese civilians didn't fight at Saipan or Okinawa (I imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could find a few exceptions).  Some did kill themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the Germans, we *did* invade, and the civilians didn't fight -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that tells you how mobilized the civilians were.
</em><br>
<p>Once a civilian has been mobilized, they are no longer a civilian. In
<br>
Saipan and Iwo Jima, there were significant civilian casualties in
<br>
combat. Not so much in Okinawa, but the native population had always
<br>
been treated poorly by the Imperial forces anyways. Observation of
<br>
mainland Japan in the months leading up to August showed that women and
<br>
schoolchildren were being trained in use of not just rifles, but even
<br>
bamboo spears.
<br>
<p>The German civilians generally didn't fight the US/British forces, but
<br>
they certainly fought against the Soviets. In early 1945, large numbers
<br>
of civilians were armed with Mauser rifles and anti-tank weapons,
<br>
primarily in eastern Germany. The public policy was fighting against all
<br>
allies, but the dispersal of resources indicates that the goal was
<br>
actually to make sure that more of Germany fell into western hands.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Under the Geneva Conventions, when a combatant hides behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;non-combatants or in non-combatant facilities, those then become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;combatant targets as well, legally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For that reason Tokyo and Hamburg are iffy - there was some military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value to  those bombing, although creating terror was an explicit part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the goals of both bombings.  But Hiroshima and Nagasaki were &quot;saved&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for A-bomb demonstrations and the US military sensibly chose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; militarily irrelevant targets.
</em><br>
<p>Hiroshima had military facilities. The iffy part was that those
<br>
facilities were not the 'ground zero' that was targeted. Neither city
<br>
was saved because it lacked military targets. As you said, they were
<br>
saved specifically so that the damage of the atomic weapons could be
<br>
more objectively evaluated. If there were prior bombing runs with
<br>
conventionals, no objective conclusions could realistically be made in
<br>
post-nuke bomb damage assessments.
