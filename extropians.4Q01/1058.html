<p>Don't worry, Spike, you can blame it all on me!  Just tell your neighbors
<br>
that Eliezer Yudkowsky was in your house at the time, and that strange
<br>
things often happen when Eliezer Yudkowsky is around.  Then, when they ask
<br>
who Eliezer Yudkowsky is, incredulously say &quot;You don't know who Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky is?&quot; and refuse to tell them anything.  If they ask you who
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky is at any later time, pretend that you've never heard
<br>
the name and are puzzled by their questions.  See if you can get your wife
<br>
to go along with it.
