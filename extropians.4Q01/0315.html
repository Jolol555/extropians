<p><em>&gt;### Your argument sounds quite plausible, however, there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem: it means that any Christian, Jew, Muslim, or any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theist who believes in a personal afterlife, acts cowardly by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dying in a war. The bomber crews in WW II, most of whom were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theists, and bombed civilian or mixed civilian-military targets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(the firebombing of Tokyo, Berlin, Dresden), must have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cowards who knowingly attacked civilians and gladly went into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;storm of AAA fire, hoping for eternal bliss if things go south.
</em><br>
<p>None of the religions you mentioned with the exception of Islam
<br>
promises eternal bliss for killing, in fact killing is seen as
<br>
wrong in all of them. How do you account for agnostics like myself
<br>
in your theory?
<br>
<p>I would have to re-read my history about Dresden, but I know both
<br>
Tokyo and Berlin had military objectives. Hiding your militay
<br>
elements amongst the civilian population eliminates the protection
<br>
civilians supposedly enjoy. Besides there was no such thing as
<br>
presicion bombing during WWII.
<br>
<p>There is a difference between killing enemy soldiers where you
<br>
yourself are also at some risk, and deliberately murdering unarmed
<br>
civilians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Is this the kind of conclusion you are drawing?
</em><br>
<p>As I indicated no.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If meanings of words are stretched to fit the emotionally charged
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moment, soon all meaning is lost. 
</em><br>
<p>As I indicated, deliberately murdering unarmed civilians is a
<br>
definition of cowardice (and a criminal act) in my book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps you could provide a definition of cowardice, a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one, fitting all situations.
</em><br>
<p>See above for a partial definition, I'll work on the rest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The 911 perps were scared (as we can infer from their writings)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they overcame their fear. If they were cowards, the WTC would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still standing.
</em><br>
<p>As I indicated, they are/were cowards by definition.
