First, I need to clear the air on a few things.  As far as the
<br>
way I experience it, I am quite &quot;bipolar&quot; about spiritual
<br>
matters.  There are times when the mystics of the ages and their
<br>
works speak directly to me and are as obviously true as the sky
<br>
outside my window.  There are other times when it all looks,
<br>
perhaps not as densely baroque and foreign as it seems to look
<br>
to many here, but does not ring within me at all.  I tend to
<br>
swing between strong rationalist worldview and something much
<br>
more spirtual/mystical.  I have spent much of my life attempting
<br>
to find an integration or resting point on this spectrum.  I'm
<br>
still swinging.
<br>
<p>Perhaps part of this characteristic bipolar worldview of mine is
<br>
the way I process information.  Remember from another post that
<br>
I don't always understand/grasp things as visuals or sets of
<br>
conceptual representations.  I process multi-dimensionally and
<br>
somewhat kinesthetically.  I feel and become what I am
<br>
considering and evaluating in part.  This is sometimes a
<br>
strength.  For instance in evaluating a complex software system
<br>
I cannot help but understand viscerally what it will be like to
<br>
actually use and work with that system.  This is very useful
<br>
although it is often difficult to explain to other engineers
<br>
where some of my evaluation comes from.  On other things it can
<br>
be quite dangerous and even destabilizing of self and
<br>
worldview.  But it is part of how I seem to be made.
<br>
<p>With that bit of intro to the often strange world of my mind...

<em>&gt; The question is not plausibility or implausibility.  The question is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian Probability Theorem.  My theory - the theory that says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're just imagining it - uniquely predicts that a certain level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intereference will be alleged.  If you consider the prior probabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for &quot;permitted level of interference&quot;, these priors have no favored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency to work out at a personally noticeable but not experimentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verifiable level of interference.  Sure, it *could* end up that way, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the prior probability of it ending up that way, given a Mind, is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I would estimate at 1% or less because of the exotic initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions required.  This is essentially the same argument against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticeable-but-not-verifiable divine intervention - you have to postulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very unusual psychology for God, where most compact descriptions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God's psychology will lead either to total uncaring or to a massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervention to reduce suffering.  Now it is of course possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postulate a set of initial conditions that produce a divine psychology or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mind psychology that engages in quiet hints for moral uplift but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive interventions.  The problem is that this is extra complexity, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable amount of extra complexity, which under Occam's Razor reduces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the likelihood of the hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I confess first of all that I am not so up on and well-versed in
<br>
the Bayseian Probability Theory to apply it well to such a
<br>
consideration or to fully evaluate whether its application to
<br>
this subject is appropriate.  Pointers to relevant information
<br>
could be useful.  I am not sure you need to posit an unusual
<br>
psychology for God (good image that) when you think about what
<br>
could lead a non-psychotic being to create more or less free
<br>
separate sentients and what its responsibility/ethics to them
<br>
once created might be.  I think your Friendly SI would also
<br>
impose some limits on the creation and treatment of sentients
<br>
that might look like very low-level interventionism.  But the
<br>
point is a bit strained to really work out. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If someone is honestly considering the Bayesian priors for Mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology, just trying out the different *a priori* plausible options and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolating them without trying to generate the specific conclusion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticeable-but-not-verifiable interference, then I don't think you'll ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run across a &quot;natural&quot; conclusion (generated without expecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion in advance) of &quot;Aha!  This scenario predicts personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticeable but not scientifically verifiable intervention, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervention is morally uplifting to those who observe it!&quot;  On the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand, the &quot;It's all a meme&quot; hypothesis does predict, as a unique outcome,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very naturally and without the need for any exotic initial conditions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that just this type of intervention will be asserted by a large group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well sure, since anything else would look quite a bit
<br>
different.  But that this is readily obvious doesn't prove that
<br>
it is the correct explanation, just that it is the easiest to
<br>
believe and follow.  The razor is not infallible by any means.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip...&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that's just for the general, vague version of spirituality.  If you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about a textual religion such as the Judeo-Christian-Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition, you have to explain why the Mind engaged in massive blatant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interventions a few thousand years back, but then suddenly kicked the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habit as soon as civilization started coughing up scientists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporters.  In this case, there's basically no way you can make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible, no matter what kind of Mind psychology you hypothesize - the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent description of past and present events forced by a text-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion has the unique signature of a human-invented false meme, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't come up with a significant prior probability of that description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being correct, no matter what initial conditions you postulate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you want my opinion, a lot of civilizations simply saw
<br>
God behind every event that was cataclysmic and unexplainable in
<br>
earlier times.  Which doesn't say much for or against a Mind
<br>
existing with some interest.  There is a possibility, while we
<br>
are speculating, that such a Mind tried various levels of local
<br>
mucking about and evolved its strategies.  But that seems
<br>
unlikely unless this is for sure a simulation at least.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Spirituality is quite falsifiable.  Try it on.  If it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; improve your life and open up your options in a way that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worth something to you then discard it.  Don't expect to weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something that rich and intricately part of life with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationality and logic alone though.  Not if you really want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Rationality and logic alone?&quot;  'Alone' is a poor word to use for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that powerful.  If my mind really is incomplete, it is perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible that my mind would not be able to *fully* understand the power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of spirituality as it stands.  But to have my mind not notice it at all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't buy it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Understandable.  Perhaps my mind simply is processing
<br>
differently than yours, not necessarily better or worse or more
<br>
or less completely.  Differently.  What &quot;sends me off&quot; into
<br>
mystical interpretations and flights of insight/intuition/joy
<br>
might be processed by you as a deeply rational set of insights
<br>
and even as joyfully but not be interpreted with the same
<br>
overtones it evokes in me.   Perhaps I am open to experiencing
<br>
some things in ways that you have decided, quite possibly for
<br>
good reasons, not to.  I don't really know.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I certainly will not &quot;try on&quot; a meme that appears to contain circular,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-reinforcing logic, as for example if the meme asserts that its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderful effects are only visible from inside the meme.  Who do you take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me for, Inoshiro?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.  On the other hand there are logical, rational
<br>
circular self-reinforcing meme patterns also.  It has fascinated
<br>
me for years that Western philosophy at least fairly neatly
<br>
bifurcates into Primacy of Consciousness axiom based viewpoints
<br>
(Idealism and most mysticism grow from here) and Primacy of
<br>
Matter axiom-based viewpoints. Both of them are relatively
<br>
closed and self-reinforcing if their axiom sets are fully
<br>
accepted.  And there is little ground to weigh the axiom sets
<br>
outside of either viewpoint.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&lt;snip..&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I would also point out that if you wish to move much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population of the world in a more positive direction the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; language of spirituality is quite important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, well, I don't just wish to move the population of the world, I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do it ethically.  I can use a certain subset of the language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality because I regard that subset as an extension of rationality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by other means.  I can't ethically use mystical language because I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in it myself.  Even if mystical language was the easy and direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to convince much of the population of the world, I still couldn't use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That makes sense to me.  And I have some problems myself with
<br>
using terms of mysticism that I do in fact believe in but
<br>
believe in in a quite different fashion than many of my
<br>
listeners.  The returns are also negative if words are used that
<br>
convey something quite different from what is meant.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spirituality that gives rise to most living ethical systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So?  Most living ethical systems today are painfully incomplete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But they do work to some degree.  Which I would argue is a
<br>
lot better than nothing.  I haven't seen as workable and
<br>
enrolling an ethical system yet based on reason alone.  I would
<br>
very much like to.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We have yet to acheive a strong ethical system using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason alone.  Creating a world that is viable and forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moving requires ethical, political, psychological and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sociological aspects as well as technological/scientific ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ethical, political, psychological, and sociological aspects can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood using rational means.  The choice of ethics may need to rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human emotional set as part of the baseline (or not - currently I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuring it both ways) but that doesn't compromise rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I wonder.  There is much in the human psychological makeup that
<br>
is not rational/logical.  I am not sure you could reach deeply
<br>
enough with an ethics that did not talk to those less rational
<br>
and logical levels successfully.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't believe the necessary work can be done with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason/rationality as usually understood alone.  If you know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it can be I would very much like to hear it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Use reason and rationality and (ethical) appeal to shared emotions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK. But if you need mythological and psychodramatic (and so
<br>
forth) elements and things that are classically &quot;mystical&quot; to
<br>
touch most minds deeply enough?  Then what?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is your construction that spritual speaking is &quot;shorthand&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are spiritual images, concepts, experiences, teachings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that simply do not translate into the language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationality/logic/reason no matter how long you speak and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; patiently intellectual you assume your audience is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you give me an example?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  But I will keep it in mind to notice one when it comes up.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I believe in a transcendent Mind not limited to what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently understand through science and that that Mind is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immanent as well and is interested and under certain conditions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least somewhat accessible.  I have little choice but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe this as I have experienced it firsthand.  Yes, I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; come up with rationalizations to &quot;debunk&quot; each such experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the ones that I could possibly have in the future.  But at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some point the effort to &quot;debunk&quot; them becomes less believable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and more contrived than accepting such as also valid.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the point I have reached and passed in my own life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't mean to sound insulting, but you do realize that unless you cite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the specific experiences (and I will understand if you are reluctant to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so), I have to assume as a working hypothesis that this statement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although originating from Samantha Atkins, is of much the same origin as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar statements made by others for personal experience of astrology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course I am far more inclined to grant you the benefit of the doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given your demonstrated rationality in other areas - but not, I'm afraid,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *that* much benefit of the doubt, not unless I know specifically what your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning is.
</em><br>
<p>This was not a simple testimonial.  I have had experiences that
<br>
I believe were of such a Mind that knocked me on my butt a few
<br>
times now.  Experiences that are, as I said, difficult to
<br>
dispose of.  At this time I don't believe it is wise to even
<br>
try.  
<br>
<p>Thank you for the discussion.  It has helped me understand my
<br>
own process a lot.
