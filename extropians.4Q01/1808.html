<p>&lt;&lt;A constant theme on this and other lists is whether
<br>
we are &quot;posthuman&quot; or merely &quot;transhuman?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to differ. This &quot;theme&quot; is rather a product
<br>
of your unwillingness to use the terminology
<br>
agreed upon by the forum. According to the
<br>
terminology of convenience &quot;we&quot; are neither
<br>
transhuman OR posthuman.  Transhumanist
<br>
is not transhuman.
<br>
<p>&lt;This is a nonsensical question based on a
<br>
popular misconception that suddenly we will
<br>
sprout a second head, or otherwise mutate into
<br>
recognisably different (posthuman) creatures!&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strawman and a silly one at that.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Transhumans will likely look much like us,
<br>
but there is no telling what in the universe a
<br>
posthuman will choose to look like. There is
<br>
an accepted terminology in play on this
<br>
swingset, you are muddying the water by
<br>
argueing definitions. Please stop, or start
<br>
your own list.
<br>
<p>&lt;Evolution does not operate like this, even in
<br>
instances where trans-species change occurs 
<br>
over a relatively short time (few 1,000's years).
<br>
We are already past the &quot;human&quot; stage. &gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably we are past the &quot;paleohuman&quot; stage,
<br>
but &quot;modern human&quot; is the typical nomenclature
<br>
for a present day Homo sapiens. Not Homo
<br>
caelestis or anything of the kind. Not yet.
<br>
Not transhuman, certainly not &quot;posthuman&quot;.
<br>
I could see you arguing &quot;trans imbecile-hominid&quot;
<br>
but that's as far as it goes.
<br>
<p>&lt;So the question isn't &quot;human, trans- or post-human?&quot;
<br>
but &quot;how posthuman?&quot;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve with all due respect. I appreciate your attempt
<br>
to sneak in the yoga with yer transhumanism, I do 
<br>
taoist kungfu myself and play with my ch'i all day at
<br>
work. I'm a psych major with a deep background in
<br>
various sorts of esoteric subjects. But this is NOT
<br>
the local Gardnerian coven or Theosophist society
<br>
where you can channel your way to Divine Inspiration.
<br>
This is a list about science, technology and the philosophy
<br>
they imply. Trying to argue metaphysical or pseudo-science
<br>
theories in this context is way out of bounds (i.e. MVT)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Way is the Way, let it inform your search for
<br>
truth without muddying the channels of other people's
<br>
communication ...please?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
Brian
