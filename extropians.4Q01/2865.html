Sure it's called nation building or the &quot;New World Order&quot; etc and it is one
<br>
of the reason a lot of the world hate us. So of course we will do it.

<em>&gt;&gt; I know there is a previous thread on this, but I can't find it, so if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nobody minds, I'd like to revisit the question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What degree of cultural engineering is necessary or desirable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Afghanistan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Should we be satisfied merely with a government that no longer gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; safe harbor to Al Quaida? Or should we strive for more, like respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for free speech, privacy, elected and accountable government, equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; protection under the law (in particular, equal rights for women)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As the 20th century shows, any society so virulently violent will strike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again if it is not significantly altered in its memetic makeup. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worked with Germany and Japan, and to a lesser degree, Italy and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rest of europe. It took Russia 70 years of stubborn bullheadedness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before our 'I told you so' started to sink in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If we opt for the latter, are we being cultural imperialists, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this is blatantly not consistant with their way of life, particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the last item? In such cases, is it necessarily wrong to be a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; imperialist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; NOTE: Spike &amp; Mike &amp; Co., please hold your fire. I already know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your take on this is, and it's not without merit, but this question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mainly addressed to the Doves. I still want to know what's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; important, human rights or the Prime Directive, and maybe this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'll get an answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heh. I'll refer instead to the Ecolitan Directive (see L.E. Modesitt's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The Ecolitan Enigma&quot;) to turn the words of a leftie against the left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Your right to swing your fist ends at my nose&quot;. This can apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collectively to collectivist societies. A country that initiates force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absent of any pan-cultural standards is asking to be rehabilitated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The difficulty, of course, is that Afghanistan, for all of its brutality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward women, is a very chaotic place. Not very totalitarian in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merely in fantasy, so holding everyone responsible as individuals is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily a good idea. S. Andrew Swann's planet Bakunin reminds me a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit of it, if sprinkled with goats milk, Allah, and opium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rather, what needs rehabilitating is not the people, but the memes which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infect them. They can be looked at as innocents in all of this, as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as any victim of the plague or smallpox. Treating Afghan society as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;epidemic, rather, that needs tight quarrantine controls along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generous doses of anti-memetic counter-programming in the form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information, technology, and development assistance, along with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generous dose of education of Enlightenment philosophy and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prohibition of Wahhabis from the country.
