</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only western artillery shells used by Iraq were actually *Canadian*

<em>&gt; &gt; exported to Angola and Iraq for use in South African artillery sold to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; UNITAS and Hussein (respectively). The Iraqi versions were armed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iraqis themselves with home grown warheads. These shells were exported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by Canada because the US had, and has, laws against exporting such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; munitions and equipment to such nations. The Canadians acted as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; middlemen, ostensibly in the case of Angola on the behest of the CIA. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the saying goes &quot;Blame Canada.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the info.  How about &quot;Blame CIA&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>The CIA's little adventure could not have worked if the Canadian
<br>
government was not willing to be an accomplice. Eventually, the US
<br>
congress did get smart to what the CIA was up to, outlawed the loophole
<br>
(an entirely legal loophole, mind you), and they convicted Dr. Bull for
<br>
which he spent a year or so in a minimum security federal country club.
<br>
The Canadians got irate that their pet artillery expert got busted.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, after the CIA got out of the Hussein-aiding business, and
<br>
after Bull got out of prison, he had lost all of his legitimate design
<br>
customers (the US Army, AVRO Canada, etc) he went to work for the South
<br>
Africans to supe up their mobile artillery (the 175mm howitzer, as I
<br>
recall, someone correct me if I'm wrong) on a supercharged chassis that
<br>
became known as the &quot;Kalahari Ferrari&quot;. After that, he went to work
<br>
directly for Hussein in Iraq, improving his artillery, redesigning his
<br>
SCUD missiles for greater range, accuracy, and payload, as well as
<br>
designing and building the two 'Supergun's, the &quot;Baby Babylon&quot; and the
<br>
&quot;Babylon Gun&quot;, which were 36&quot; bore cannons, 100 and 1000 feet long,
<br>
respectively. The purpose of the gun was to give Hussein the ability to
<br>
launch small payloads into orbit (which the 1000 ft long gun would have
<br>
done) which could reenter on any location within the 40th north and
<br>
south latitudes.
<br>
<p>After Bull built and tested the Baby Babylon gun, which had a range of
<br>
120 miles, he was assasinated by a Mossad team a few months before the
<br>
invasion of Kuwait, and after being warned by the CIA to cease and
<br>
desist his work for Saddam.
