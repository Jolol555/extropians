<em>&gt; &gt; There are some borderline cases like the Balkan situation, but if you

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's probably because those countries don't exist.  (I mean which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country has completely free press?  Laws and rights respected by who?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, another democracy clash (not using Anders's tight definition, but 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Free press doesn't mean you can print *anything*, but rather that you
<br>
are allowed to express opinions freely about a wide range of subjects,
<br>
especially society, economics and ideology without legal or other
<br>
reprisal. It is not a binary state, but a continuum. The same goes for
<br>
respect for law. 
<br>
<p>I can of course weasel my way out of a claim like the one I did by
<br>
arbitrarily tightening my definition of democracy, but that would make
<br>
the claim irrelevant. Instead we can turn it around: what is the case of
<br>
the most democratic countries going at war against each other, and why
<br>
did it happen?
<br>
<p>The Ecuador-Peru conflict might be such an example. I see that the
<br>
Freedom house freedom index (combining various civil liberties) of Peru
<br>
in the period is 5.4 (partially free, just below unfree) and 2.3 (free)
<br>
for Ecuador (lower scores mean more freedom, most western states lie
<br>
near 1.1, Afghanistan reaches 7.7); Peru also seem to have taken the
<br>
initiative in the conflict. 
<br>
<p>Is this the conflict between the freest countries we can find?
<br>
India-Pakistan seems to come close; Pakistan seem to move between 3.5
<br>
and 7.5 over the last 30 years, while India has been 2.3-4.4. Again,
<br>
this is an old local conflict which might reflect more on local powers
<br>
and militaries than the central powers.
