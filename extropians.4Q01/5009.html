<p>Such evidence would certainly modify my original somewhat sarcastic comment

on Mike's gripe at being supplanted--due, of course, to market forces--by
<br>
programmers in India. 
<br>
<p>(I was amazed, incidentally, at how long it took everyone to understand
<br>
that Olga thought Mike was talking about Native Americans rather than
<br>
Indians--and a little disheartened by her original rush-to-judgement

misreading, since it assumed Mike would post a racist comment; he's not
<br>
like that.)

<p><em>&gt;The strong US dollar has certainly benefited the local film

<p>Indeed. As a writer who sells more in the USA than at home, I gain this
<br>
terrific, and unfair, advantage myself. In effect, I make twice as much for
<br>
a given novel as an American would, and live better anyway. Yum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Onward! TANSTAAFL!
</em><br>
<p>Yep, even if it means that Mike and other vulnerable US extropians get
<br>
bitten in the ass by the power of the global market.
