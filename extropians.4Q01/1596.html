<p><em>&gt; A tolerant society allows all ideas to be expressed; it even allows

</em><br>
<em>&gt; consent of all parties affected, but even the most liberal society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot tolerate coercive and violent actions except in self-defense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and even to most peaceful society must occasionally itself respond

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and prevented from killing others.
</em><br>
<p>What if a particular meme is acted upon with high frequency, and this
<br>
action is a violent one? What if a promoter of this meme moves in next
<br>
to you, should you seek to stop them or wait until the meme spread and
<br>
is acted upon and then defend against or avenge each individual
<br>
action?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eli's point is quite valid: a tolerant society in which ideas are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed freely will result in better technologies, including those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies that are useful for defense.  And such a society will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize that using them is necessary.
</em><br>
<p>A tolerant society will by its nature also relinquish certain very
<br>
effective weapons it invents, such as mind control and germ warfare.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1a. Furthermore, when an ends-justify-means calculus is employed, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; end up with the problem of entrusting somebody with the priviledged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; position of deciding which ends justify which which means. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; friendly AI might do it Eliezer, but even the best intentioned humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inevitably lapse into &quot;MY ends justify the means&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, how is this at all relevant to the argument given?  Yes, evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do evil things.  No kidding.  How is this in any way related to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea that tolerant societies will have a better military AND more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open policies.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not talking about evil here. I'm merely saying that if any amount
<br>
of secrecy or fiat rule is necessary to the survival of a society,
<br>
then it will be leveraged by those in on the secret for personal gain
<br>
and to the detriment of the society that entrusted them with the
<br>
secret. Since you disagree with my premise that secrecy is necessary
<br>
to a society's survival (and I don't blame you, I'm not sure I think
<br>
it's actually necessary-- I just see that it's omnipresent) we can't
<br>
really debate point 1a at this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3. Superior technology and economy does not necesserily trump a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superior strategic position. Witness American Revolution, siege of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Stalingrad, Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, Vietnam War, Chechnya, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of course our current war against a delocalized enemy with wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; popular support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the long run, it does.  Sure, there will be setbacks, but a closed
</em><br>
<p>Let's keep in mind that any one of these setbacks could usher in a new
<br>
Dark Ages that will delay the singularity by a couple of generations,
<br>
halt life extension research, and/or destroy your cryo-provider's
<br>
ability to maintain the temperature of your DeWar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; society is self-defeating: even if it wins one war, its closedness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will cause it to fall even further behind and lose the power to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain itself.  It will be beseiged by rebellion from within.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerant-minded people will not stand idly by while government use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force to oppress and murder their citizens--they can and will rebel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and establish new order, just as we did here, or else they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave for somewhere else, and the remains of the intolerant society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will collapse from brain-drain.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, and this is precisely why the closed vs open society dilemma
<br>
reminds me of Prisoner's Dilemma cellular automata that I mentioned in
<br>
my post-- it appears that neither cooperators nor defectors can
<br>
completely win... but defectors can destroy the game by driving the
<br>
cooperators to extinction. Perhaps if there are ways to make a PD-CA
<br>
game stable, their geopolitical analogues can be applied to the
<br>
present situation.
