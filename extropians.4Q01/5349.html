<em>&gt; Anyway, I was discussing the idea of lawyer-bots with my group's CTO,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how we might be able to develop them.  The closest thing he had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard of was a limited use script, used by some Brazilian judges to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly decide standard traffic cases (accidents, et cetera).  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed, as a first generation, a lawyer's aide that could predict,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than lawyers themselves with the tools they currently have, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the likely outcome of a case would be, based on the facts available and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evidence each side was likely to be able to obtain.  (I had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify this in monetary terms somehow, and that seemed an easy path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from tech to money.  Besides, it was an extension of the Brazilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; script he already knew was working.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He seemed to like the idea and believed the core tech was feasable, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soured on the interface: if it's going to be the hundreds or thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pull-down menus and similar widgets needed to properly classify a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, forget it.  I considered free-text entry, say like an advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chatbot, but figured that natural language processing probably is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced enough for use by lawyers (except those lawyers who are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geeks, but that dramatically narrows the target market).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem?
</em><br>
<p>I would disagree -- natural language processing is certainly advanced enough
<br>
to deal with this sort of thing, if I userstand correctly what you're after.
<br>
Anyone on the list care to help me out with some more pertinant links beyond
<br>
the general ones below?
