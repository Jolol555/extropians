<p>&lt;&lt; Good point. If you can furnish me a reference to a statement by a
<br>
&nbsp;Wahhabi cleric condemning the terrorist attacks of 9/11, I will
<br>
&nbsp;rephrase my sig and post a retraction. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Few and far between. More often people like myself can find very recent 
<br>
quotes of mulllahs excusing the lads on 9-11 for their 'sacrifices.'
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Would it kill them to just condemn it and leave it at that
<br>
without using it as a platform to disseminate their views on Iraq and
<br>
Israel? Yes, Israelis are oppressing Palestinians and I'd vote to stop
<br>
them if I had the opportunity. Yes, we need to find a way to contain
<br>
or remove Hussein without harming civilians the way our current
<br>
sanctions are.  But attaching these issues as a rider to 9/11...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>For such an erudite group as the extropians, its a tad, bit, disconcerting, 
<br>
to see them fall into world-views that are a bit simplistic. Not to adopt and 
<br>
amoral, Nietzschian, politik; but rather then merely, say, the Palestininans 
<br>
are &quot;oppressed&quot;, it is better to acknowledge what is closer to the truth, 
<br>
that they are both the victims and the aggressors. This can be indicated by 
<br>
the politicians and guerilla movements they suport. The Israelis have been 
<br>
less then circumscribe, in previous years, and decades, to intiating 
<br>
possible, viable, peace deals. They are paying for that lack of independent, 
<br>
engagement now.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;1. ...rewards the perpetrators by promoting their stated agenda.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. ...diminishes the horror and senselessness of 6000 people being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;murdered.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. ...is a petty, self-serving, and transparent stance that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calls into question the sincerity of the supposed moderates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that make such statements.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The primary reason for this the universal Islamic Universities policies of  
<br>
blamming America for every ill the Islamic World has. This goes far beyond 
<br>
the focus on Israel, and is chiefly focused on the fall of the United States. 
<br>
These teachings are the primary intellectual and ideological direction in 
<br>
Islamic nations such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. These governements use this 
<br>
mentality in order to relief anger at their own, local, deficiencies, with 
<br>
unresponsive, autocratic, regimes.
<br>
<p>What apparently is being taught is that America will soon fall. Bin Ladin's 
<br>
philosophy has found a rich envrionment in which to thrive in. We need to 
<br>
eliminate reliance of Middle eastern oil NOW!
