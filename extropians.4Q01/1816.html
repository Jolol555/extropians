</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more like a million.  So now there are God modules.  Innate advantage?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Seems unlikely.  Social advantage only.  Disadvantage in an absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you should read up on Far Eastern religious history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before you claim that those who practiced religion less or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different ways were so strongly oppressed that the meme was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforced.
</em><br>
<p>Repression doesn't need to be universal, or a necessary property of
<br>
religion, for a God Module to evolve.  Repression just needs to happen
<br>
frequently enough to be a regularity in the environment that creates a
<br>
selection pressure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hinduism and Buddhism in particular, at least in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their forms, do not require fixed adherence to a single dogma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even to belief in God or gods and goddesses.   Buddhism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even less restrictive as its primary original lines were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theistic and certainly did not enforce Buddhist memes.  Another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small problem is that some of these faiths tend toward celibacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the most faithful and especially the leadership.  So one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonders how these strong religion/spirituality memes would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propagate so well under such conditions.
</em><br>
<p>I'm very much afraid that religions calling for celibacy may have wiped
<br>
out the tendency to live up to the logical consequences of one's beliefs -
<br>
that and all the other memes, even truthful memes, that called for any
<br>
kind of personal sacrifice.  Evolutionary changes that wipe out existing
<br>
functionality rather than creating new functionality can happen much
<br>
faster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, relatively socially coherent religious systems rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many competing superstitions and views are a fairly recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon - more like the last 10,000 years than the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100,000 by what evidence we have.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly right.  Buddhism, and all the enlightened modern
<br>
interpretations of bloodthirsty old-time religions, are certainly not
<br>
10,000 years old, and the last ten thousand years are irrelevant in terms
<br>
of evolution - enough to drive the species to one end or another of an
<br>
existing variant distribution; not enough to create de novo complex
<br>
functional adaptation.  All that matters in terms of evolution is the
<br>
90,000 years before that and the million years before that, back in the
<br>
hunter-gatherer tribes.  I strongly suspect that having a different
<br>
religion back then could be fatal... or at least, that challenging any
<br>
tenet of the tribe's religion was tantamount to challenging the local
<br>
witch doctor to a duel, and you had better be ready to win if you tried.
