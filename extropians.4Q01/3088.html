In a source I doubt many have access to:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nov. 19, 2001-- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geron Corporation (Nasdaq:GERN) announced today positive results of in vivo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies with human brain tumors in a mouse model when treated with Geron's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proprietary anti-cancer compound, GRN163. The studies were directed jointly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Dennis Deen, Ph.D., professor of neurological surgery at University of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Geron scientists. The results were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented by Tomoko Ozawa, M.D., Ph.D., UCSF associate specialist of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurological surgery, at the Society of Neuro-Oncology meeting in Washington
</em><br>
<em>&gt; D.C. on November 17. Drs. Deen and Ozawa collaborated with Geron through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sponsored research agreement that UCSF has with Geron.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Developed by Geron scientists, GRN163 is a short, modified oligonucleotide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compound that acts as a telomerase template antagonist. The compound binds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tightly to the template domain of the RNA component in the active site of telomerase,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocking the activity of the enzyme.  GRN163 was chemically modified to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce improved cellular uptake and biodistribution as well as resistance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degradation and enhanced binding affinity to telomerase. GRN163 inhibits purified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telomerase at extremely low concentrations and does not inhibit other critical enzymes. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The treatment was for gioblastomas (brain cancers) in mice and in all
<br>
cases the size of the tumors was reduced -- in some cases by 70-80%.
<br>
<p>[N.B. Buyer beware -- don't use this to rush out and buy Geron stock
<br>
unless you want it as a long term component of your portfolio.]
<br>
<p>And the NY Times has an article about ACT's success in cloning cows:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/science/23COWS.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/science/23COWS.html</a>
<br>
<p>In particular:
<br>
<em>&gt; The company created nearly 500 embryos by cloning; 30 survived to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birth, of which 24 grew to adulthood.
</em><br>
<p>Its nice to know it works, but at a 6% birth rate and 4.8% success rate
<br>
to adults it isn't exactly what one would call a &quot;reliable&quot; method.
<br>
