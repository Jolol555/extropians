<em>&gt;From: Charlie Stross &lt;<a href="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20If%20we%20do%20get%20Afghanistan,%20what%20shall%20we%20do%20with%20it?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111212150.NAA28620@well.com&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Which is why the CIA organised a coup in 1953 that ousted a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;democratically elected prime minister (in Iran) and installed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an hereditary dictatorship, huh? (Clue: the previous Iranian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government was not a Soviet proxy.)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It had a hell of a lot more to do with cheap oil, and taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the former British and French spheres of interest in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;middle east (acquired during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the 1918-1930 period) than with anything as long-term and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enlightened as combating communism.
</em><br>
<p>You need to go back and check the facts, it was the British who
<br>
were worried about possible nationalization of the oil industry in
<br>
Iran who first conceived of the operation and cajoled the U.S into
<br>
helping.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;_That_ particular pigeon came home to roost with a vengeance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in 1979 (although the signs suggest that Iran is settling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down again).
</em><br>
<p>Iran isn't exactly a good neighbor.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The picture of &quot;democracy vs totalitarianism&quot; is a cosy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comforting one but by no means universally true. In fact, much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what went on during the Cold War was more along the lines of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imperial power-grab, as US companies moved into the power vacuum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left behind by the withdrawl of the former colonial powers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then lobbied for backup from the State Department.
</em><br>
<p>Instead of conjecture, bring up a real incident and lets check out
<br>
the facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This isn't to exculpate the Soviets -- who were in it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever they could get -- but if you look at a polar projection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;map of the world, centred on the North Pole, as it looked in 1960
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in terms of alliances, it looks *very* different from the Mercator
</em><br>
<em>&gt;projection so common in Western school rooms. Clue: which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;projection do you think was hanging in the Kremlin?
</em><br>
<p>I'll let the audience help.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Absolutely! And the sad fact is, history as taught in the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appears to be about as accurate as the history taught in Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or German or Russian schools, or preached in mosques ... i.e., not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very.
</em><br>
<p>Apparently British history books leave out a few things too like
<br>
British involvement in 1953 Iran coup.
