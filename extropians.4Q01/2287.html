<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>Now prying open this article: &quot;Rogue Males&quot; from The Guardian,
<br>
which was posted here on the Extropians list, about a month ago.
<br>
<p>I strongly disliked this article for a number of reasons. To gain
<br>
some facts regarding some Middle East cultural aspects, of which
<br>
I was ignorant, I talked with my neighbor, an egyptian muslim.
<br>
We went through this article line-by-line. (He was even more
<br>
upset by the article than I was!) I learned some things.
<br>
Maybe others here will too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Guardian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tuesday October 2, 2001
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Rogue males
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lionel Tiger
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What makes young Muslim men turn to terrorism? Leaders such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as Osama Bin Laden know just how to distil a deadly fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from their anger, excess energy and religious devotion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;writes Lionel Tiger
</em><br>
<p>Author/editor immediately starts with inflammatory words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;An outstanding characteristic of the miserable band of worshippers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsible for the savage events of September 11 is that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all male. Virtually all the fist-shakers we see in news clips of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-American demonstrations in Pakistan and elsewhere are men, too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually relatively young ones. What does this have to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;September 11, Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, and the future?
</em><br>
<p>Very little.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One of the most difficult tasks for any social system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;figuring out what to do with its young males. These are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invariably the most impressionable, energetic, socially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exigent, and politically inept members of any group. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause trouble for their elders and ruthlessly hassle each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other. They pose chronic danger to public order when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drive, drink and take drugs.
</em><br>
<p>The author makes a HUGE assumption that Muslim teenagers are
<br>
different from teenagers all over the world, and the author
<br>
continues to place links before the reader that
<br>
Muslims == terrorists.
<br>
<p>Has the author spent any time in the Middle East? In Egypt, teens are
<br>
like teens in the West: they like video games, like to go out with
<br>
their friends (male AND female!), *occasionally* they drink, but
<br>
please note that their Muslim religion strongly discourages drinking
<br>
and drug use, and so their &quot;drink and take drugs&quot; is less than in
<br>
the West.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Various communities cause their young men to endure a startling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;often gory array of harassing rituals and trials in order to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceptable adults. In his autobiography, Nelson Mandela says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only after his circumcision at the age of 15 did he feel ready to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assume the chieftaincy he inherited.
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The terrorism of Bin Laden harnesses the chaos of young men, uniting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the energies of political ardour and sex in a turbulent fuel.
</em><br>
The structure of al-Qaida -
<br>
<p>Inflammatory words again, mixing Muslims and terrorists again....
<br>
<p>And what % of people in Egypt (for example) are associated
<br>
with al-Qaida ? Perhaps about 1% ...
<br>
<p>According to my neighbor, dividing the religious groups in Egypt
<br>
shows that about 1% are Jewish, 12-15% are Orthodox Christian,
<br>
about 85% are Muslim. Any people associated with the al-Qaida's are
<br>
a tiny percentage and not liked.
<br>
<p>Almost all of the Muslims strongly dislike the activities of the
<br>
terrorists, including bin Laden. The only possible reason that bin
<br>
Laden has any favorable perception by people there is that he is
<br>
&quot;successful&quot;. He is like a pop icon. In a country where people are
<br>
extremely poor, there is a distorted appreciation for
<br>
something/someone that appears to be successful, especially against
<br>
a country (U.S.) that is far more rich and powerful
<br>
(not to mention, arrogant, IMO).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;an all-male enterprise, of course -
</em><br>
<p>&quot;of course&quot; ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Their comfort in an all-male world begins with the high sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;segregation of many of the Muslim communities from which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorists draw.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;While there are great variations among Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communities, the sharp tendency is toward sexually segregated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;societies. Contact between the sexes is tightly restricted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;draconian moral codes. Not only are women's faces veiled, so is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their behaviour. This means that men and women have relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little to do with people of the opposite sex. Therefore, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop a great deal of reliance on those of their own.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;high sex segregation&quot; ? &quot;tightly restricted&quot; ?
<br>
<p>&quot;draconian moral codes&quot; ? &quot;women's faces veiled&quot; ?
<br>
<p>Wrong. In Egypt young people, men and women, are mixed in their
<br>
interactions with each other. The only segration occurs inside of a
<br>
mosque. Women vote. Women participate in almost all aspects of
<br>
society. It's not perfect and could be better, but the author's
<br>
sentences above paint a very fictitious picture.
<br>
<p>I asked my neighbor about Egyptian daily living- do women dress any
<br>
particular way under religious and social pressure? He told me that
<br>
40% wear veils, and this has a wide spectrum: from covering the
<br>
whole head (showing only their eyes) to a light piece of brightly
<br>
colored cloth over the hair. In Egypt, it's extreme to see a woman
<br>
veiled with only the eyes showing, and there must be a strong
<br>
explanation for that because most women there do not experience
<br>
pressure from the men to wear veils. In general, the women like
<br>
(because of fashion and comfort and tradition!) the brightly colored
<br>
light cloths that some call &quot;veils&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Most men in most societies marry, or try to. This is more difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than usual in polygamous societies in which powerful men may have as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many as four wives, leaving three potential husbands without a date
</em><br>
for Saturday night - or any night.
<br>
<p>&quot;in polygamous societies&quot; ?
<br>
<p>Polygamy is not common there. Not in Egypt. It's slighly more common
<br>
in the Gulf states than in Egypt, but it's still very unusual. Of
<br>
men, you find mostly the richest (in Saudi Arabia, for example) or
<br>
the most powerful politicians living a polygamous lifestyle (even
<br>
though their religion permits it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The sexuality and reproductive potential of such young men
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not an unimportant matter politically. The United Arab
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Emirates, not normally considered forerunners of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progressive movement, have taken an inventive action that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reflects how difficult it is for men and women to mate in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traditional manner. To marry a local woman, men of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nation must provide gifts, feasts, and ritual performances
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that may cost as much as $40,000 (£27,000) - an impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accumulation for all but a few.
</em><br>
<p>Now we hear the author's scientific theory about breeding in the
<br>
Muslim societies ...
<br>
<p>(excuse my heavy sarcastic tone.. but I *hate* science being
<br>
insidiously applied to a whole culture, attempting to give a
<br>
collection of erroneous assumptions some validity)
<br>
<p>&quot;$40,000 (£27,000) - an impossible accumulation for all but a few&quot;
<br>
<p>is a peanut amount of money for the many in the United Emirates.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It is in the crucible of all-male intensity that the bonds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of terrorist commitment and self-denial are formed. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They are not lonely psychopaths but demented special forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wearing anonymity like a uniform. They share and catalyse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;swirling energies and religious absolutism [...]
</em><br>
<p>Inflammatory words again, mixing  Muslims and terrorists again....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's all something grand to do. So much better than the few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jobs available, the threadbare economies, the ramshackle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;societies run either by altogether corrupt cynics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;autocratic monarchies feeding princes foie gras, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theocracies that mistake reading ancient books for action.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;autocratic monarchies&quot; were put in place by outsiders (for example,
<br>
the U.S. government).
<br>
<p>----------------
<br>
<p>So now a few words related, but not criticizing this article, which
<br>
came out of the discussions with my neighbor.
<br>
<p>In the last 50-60 years, Islam has become mixed with politics, which
<br>
has many bad consequences for people practicing their religion.
<br>
These bad consequences, many of you know about. If one considers
<br>
that the major religions have an &quot;evolutionary lifecycle&quot;, then
<br>
Islam is probably overdue for a &quot;reformation&quot; similar to
<br>
Christianity's Reformation.
<br>
<p>Some Muslims have tried, and continue to try, to put Islam and the
<br>
Koran into a different light, to bring a healthier dimension to the
<br>
religion. The most recent Muslim scholar that I heard about via my
<br>
neighbor is a man: Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid. He an Egyptian teacher who
<br>
has written some works that interpret the Koran in the context of
<br>
life at the time that the Koran was written (~600AD). He is now
<br>
living in exile with his wife in The Netherlands. The story about
<br>
him is here, but I will quote the main elements.
<br>
<p>Background on his story
<br>
<a href="http://msanews.mynet.net/Scholars/NasrAbu/">http://msanews.mynet.net/Scholars/NasrAbu/</a>
<br>
Especially this:

<br>
<p>------------------
<br>
{Begin Quote}
<br>
<p>On 5 August 1996, Egyptian academic and writer Dr Nasr Hamed
<br>
Abu-Zeid was ordered to divorce from his wife after being branded an
<br>
apostate by the Court of Cassation.
<br>
<p>(20 June 1995)
<br>
<p>The court ruled that Dr Abu-Zeid was an apostate, confirming a
<br>
decision by the Cairo Court of Appeals in June 1995 where the
<br>
verdict stated:
<br>
<p>&quot;The court announces the separation of the first defendant [Dr
<br>
Abu-Zeid] from his wife, the second defendant, because of the
<br>
former's apostasy and because she is a Muslim. And the court calls
<br>
on the first defendant to repent to God Almighty and to return to
<br>
the Islamic religion which was brought as a light to the people to
<br>
being them happiness in this world and the hereafter.&quot;
<br>
<p>The charges of apostasy date back to 1993 when Dr Abu-Zeid, a
<br>
professor of Arabic Literature at Cairo University, was denied a
<br>
promotion after a colleague made accusations against his writing on
<br>
the basis that it insulted Islam. The accusations followed the
<br>
publication of Dr Abu-Zeid's book &quot;Criticism of Religious
<br>
Discourse&quot;, in which he criticised Islamic investment companies for
<br>
which the colleague was acting as a consultant.
<br>
<p>The charges related to several of Dr Abu-Zeid's books and articles.
<br>
In &quot;Criticism of Religious Discourse&quot;, he states that religious
<br>
texts have to be re-interpreted in their original historical and
<br>
social context. He writes, for example, &quot;Since language develops
<br>
with the development of society and culture, providing new ideas and
<br>
developing its terminology to express more developed relations, then
<br>
it is necessary and only natural to re-interpret texts in their
<br>
original historical and social context, replacing them with more
<br>
contemporary interpretations that are more humanistic and developed,
<br>
while keeping the content of the verses stable.&quot;
<br>
<p>{End Quote}
<br>
------------------
<br>
<p>Is this kind of political persecution of religious beliefs common in
<br>
Egypt? No. But it _does_ happen (what is even more wierd is that the
<br>
&quot;colleague [who] made accusations against his writing&quot; is now
<br>
undergoing a similar kind of persecution in Egypt, and this is
<br>
what I mean that the religion has become political.
<br>
<p>I tried hard to find  Abu Zeid's works in English, but so far, I've
<br>
been unsuccessful. You can find his most important work translated
<br>
into German however:
<br>
<p>Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid

<p>I hope that my discourse, here, is helpful.
