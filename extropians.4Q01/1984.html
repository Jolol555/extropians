</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I do ignore much People's Party Policy lines taken right out of the
<br>
playbook. They've been debunked so repeatedly the world over that they
<br>
are really not worth my time here. Much of your 'lines of reasoning' is
<br>
constructed on false assumptions, which I have pointed out many times in
<br>
the past, which I do not need to repeat over and over. Your
<br>
moral/cultural relativism has likewise been debunked/discredited
<br>
repeatedly on this list.
<br>
<p>It's not hard to make a rather straight determination that our system is
<br>
objectively better: take Afghanistan, allegedly the most pure islamic
<br>
state in many centuries, is a wasteland of fear, repression, violence,
<br>
and hate. Then take the US, which provides a higher standard of living,
<br>
liberty, and happiness to more people than any other country in the
<br>
world, where even the most downtrodden homeless outcasts have more going
<br>
for them than 90% of the rest of the human race.
<br>
<p>The Islamic world does not hate us because we don't live up to our own
<br>
ideals all the time. Those that claim so are constructing a straw man.
<br>
No society ever lives up to its ideals. That is why they are called
<br>
ideals and not standards. The islamic world wants us to become the sort
<br>
of country the Christian Reconstructionists want, they are a sort of
<br>
christian Taliban in that way. The islamic world hates us because we
<br>
illustrate by contrast how poorly the islamic world has lived up to its
<br>
own ideals AND standards. That we, the infidels, do a much better (if
<br>
not perfect) job of it grates their sense of honor greatly.
<br>
<p>Those who claim we don't support democracies in the muslim world are
<br>
liars. Turkey has been a longtime friend of the US, we have frequently
<br>
supported it against the claims of Greece, and it has maintained a
<br>
democracy far more fair and stable than most others in the world. Kuwait
<br>
is also democratic. It has an elected Parliamentary system where the
<br>
Emir acts much as a 'lord protector' much as Oliver Cromwell did in the
<br>
British revolution. We also supported the development of democracy in
<br>
Algeria, until, of course, it was threatened by the election of islamic
<br>
fundamentalists who wanted to dismantle that democracy.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Samantha and others claim that the US needs to start listening to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of the world, and shaping its policy more in line with the way the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of the world thinks it should be. Since Samantha opened the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argument to profanity, I shall continue it with a hearty &quot;fuck that&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The US did not get where it is today as the preeminent economic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military, and cultural power in the world, while concurrently having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most free society on earth, by doing things the way others thought we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should do them. We did it OUR way, the way we knew in our hearts to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; best, not just for us, but for the world, and as a result, the world has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gotten through the age of nuclear brinksmanship in far better shape than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'll bet would have occured if any other power had been in our place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ideas like individual liberty and democratic/republican values are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pre-eminent ideas in politics around the world today specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because of us. This didn't happen by us letting others tell us how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things should be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tell it to Allende.  What often did not act as we know is best.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Period.  To claim otherwise in light of what has been unearthed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of CIA operations alone cannot be called anything other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonest. We haven't given a rat's ass for the democratically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elected leadership of other countries in too many instances if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that leadership would not play ball with us and whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests (general commercial) we supported.  Or do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the CIA was prohibited from being in the assasination business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 1981 for no reason at all?
</em><br>
<p>Allende sought to end the free market system in his country and usher in
<br>
a socialist/communist government.
<br>
<p>Democracy is not the only ideal. Free markets are the other, for they
<br>
are the most democratic of systems. The democratic election of despots
<br>
can and should be opposed by all liberty loving people, whether their
<br>
name is Hitler, Moussolini, Ortega, Stalin, or Allende.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Those around the world who want to start telling us how things should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; done do so specifically because their own power is threatened by our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles and influence. They are supporting terrorism specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because it is the best technique designed to date for getting large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; masses of civilians to question their principles, at a cost that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; smaller than most any other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is an outrageous claim.  Here is an alternative.  When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are oppressed by the biggest bully around and you have no means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fighting back on the bully's terms, some will use whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means they can find to strike back.
</em><br>
<p>Straw man. The assumption that we are the biggest bully is a false one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not our principles that we practice in our own country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are the problem.  It is that we do not export them well and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often do not act on them when it comes to other countries.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must question whether our practice abroad is in keeping with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those principles you and I both admire.  I believe that in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases it has not been so and is not so today.
</em><br>
<p>Why is it that cultural relativists like yourself who claim there is no
<br>
objective truth are so militantly insistent that we act so objectively?
