<p>
Back when I was young (no sniggers, please), and the rising forces of
<br>
Political Correctness were threatening to take over the world, I thought
<br>
the whole PC thing was just a straightforward witch hunt, which is to say,
<br>
an attack on a nonexistent enemy imagined up by the witch-hunt leaders for
<br>
the sake of self-promotion.  Some time later I learned just how recently
<br>
the battle against racism had been won, and even encountered some
<br>
still-active remnants of racism in some of my older
<br>
(grandparent-generation) relatives, after which I had rather more sympathy
<br>
for the PC activists - I still thought that what they were doing was wrong
<br>
and harmful, but at least I had a better idea of why, historically, they
<br>
were doing it.
<br>
<p>However, one opinion which hasn't changed between then and now is that
<br>
noticing races, even for the purpose of combating racism, is
<br>
counterproductive.  Things may have been different during the 1960s, yes,
<br>
even during the 1970s, but by the time I was growing up the ONLY reason I
<br>
knew that races even *existed* was my exposure to newspaper articles
<br>
telling me it was wrong to be racist.  As we all know, and as Tooby and
<br>
Cosmides recently reverified, humans are obsessed with factions.  Those
<br>
contaminating newspaper articles switched on my faction-tracking brainware
<br>
and I didn't manage to shut it off until years later.
<br>
<p>As I recall, I never permitted myself to consciously think of races as
<br>
valid factions, thanks to a diet of anti-speciesist science fiction.  But
<br>
managing my unconscious reactions was - at that age - a lot more
<br>
difficult.  These articles about racism switched on my faction-tracking
<br>
brainware; they caused me to begin noticing and tracking for the first
<br>
time which color someone was.  Then there was the idea that it was okay to
<br>
be proud of one's race as long as it was a minority race, and the spate of
<br>
studies showing this or that alleged minority superiority, and the
<br>
refutations by the scientific advocates of colorblindness, and the
<br>
factionalist social articles showing that &lt;ethnic&gt; still had a higher rate
<br>
of poverty and criminal arrests, and so on.  Even though I always reminded
<br>
myself that these studies were worthless, doing so meant that the
<br>
article's content was rising to mind and being fed into the
<br>
faction-tracking brainware.
<br>
<p>I lost my innate colorblindness because of these idiot race-affirming
<br>
anti-racist articles.  And then I had to go through a lot of pointless
<br>
struggle in order to get it back.  As far as I'm concerned, when things
<br>
reach that point for my generation, it means that any further affirmation
<br>
of &quot;race&quot; as a concept is counterproductive, even for the purpose of
<br>
redressing past wrongs.  Maybe it's too late to do this for my generation,
<br>
but as far as I'm concerned, a generation should grow up not knowing that
<br>
race ever even existed until they learn about it in high school at the age
<br>
of seventeen.
<br>
<p>Now I'm sure that there are still some lingering afteraffects of past
<br>
racism, but the point is that you don't have to acknowledge race in order
<br>
to address these problems.  If an undue number of &lt;ethnics&gt; are living in
<br>
poverty, you don't have to organize a nonprofit to help &lt;ethnics&gt;;
<br>
organizing a nonprofit to help people in poverty works just as well.  (It
<br>
does have to be a nonprofit, though, and not a government program, for
<br>
reasons I expect we all know by now.)  So I get ticked off whenever people
<br>
try to make out like &quot;colorblindness&quot; somehow equates to ignoring real
<br>
problems.  If &lt;ethnics&gt; are in &lt;trouble&gt; it can be observed and dealt with
<br>
as &lt;trouble&gt;, not &lt;ethnic trouble&gt;.  People who argue against
<br>
colorblindness seem to think that there are only two options, either
<br>
explicitly trying to deal with &lt;ethnic trouble&gt; or pretending that &lt;ethnic
<br>
trouble&gt; doesn't exist.  Colorblindness consists of ignoring the &lt;ethnic&gt;
<br>
and dealing with the &lt;trouble&gt;.
<br>
<p>Because there are still some remnants of real racism in America, not to
<br>
mention the rest of the world, there may perhaps still be a place for
<br>
continued anti-racism.  But there's also a place for pure colorblindness. 
<br>
And that place is my generation.
<br>
<p>You'll note that, throughout this entire post, I never once named a
<br>
particular ethnic group.  I wouldn't want anyone to start unconsciously
<br>
tracking factions.
