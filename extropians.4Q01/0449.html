Machines with a human touch

<br>
Instead of using the ones and zeros of digital electronics to simulate the way
<br>
the brain functions, &quot;neuromorphic&quot; engineering relies on nature's biological
<br>
short-cuts to make robots that are smaller, smarter and vastly more
<br>
energy-efficient
<br>
<p>&nbsp;PEOPLE have become accustomed to thinking of artificial intelligence and
<br>
natural intelligence as being completely different-both in the way they work
<br>
and in what they are made of. Artificial intelligence (AI) conjures up images
<br>
of silicon chips in boxes, running software that has been written using human
<br>
expertise as a guide. Natural intelligence gives the impression of
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;wetware&quot;-cells interacting biologically with one another and with the
<br>
environment, so that the whole organism can learn through experience. But that
<br>
is not the only way to look at intelligence, as a group of electronics
<br>
engineers, neuroscientists, roboticists and biologists demonstrated recently
<br>
at a three-week workshop held in Telluride, Colorado.
<br>
<p>What distinguished the group at Telluride was that they shared a wholly
<br>
different vision of AI. Rather than write a computer program from the top down
<br>
to simulate brain functions, such as object recognition or navigation, this
<br>
new breed of &quot;neuromorphic engineers&quot; builds machines that work (it is
<br>
thought) in the same way as the brain. Neuromorphic engineers look at brain
<br>
structures such as the retina and the cortex, and then devise chips that
<br>
contain neurons and a primitive rendition of brain chemistry. Also, unlike
<br>
conventional AI, the intelligence of many neuromorphic systems comes from the
<br>
physical properties of the analog devices that are used inside them, and not
<br>
from the manipulation of 1s and 0s according to some modelling formula. In
<br>
short, they are wholly analog machines, not digital ones.
<br>
<p>The payoff for this &quot;biological validity&quot;, comes in size, speed and low power
<br>
consumption. Millions of years of evolution have allowed nature to come up
<br>
with some extremely efficient ways of extracting information from the
<br>
environment. Thus, good short-cuts are inherent in the neuromorphic approach.
<br>
<p>At the same time, the electronic devices used to implement neuromorphic
<br>
systems are crucial. Back in the 1940s, when computers were first starting to
<br>
take shape, both analog and digital circuits were used. But the analog devices
<br>
were eventually abandoned because most of the applications at the time needed
<br>
equipment that was more flexible. Analog devices are notoriously difficult to
<br>
design and reprogram. And while they are good at giving trends, they are poor
<br>
at determining exact values.
<br>
<p>In analog circuits, numbers are represented qualitatively: 0.5 reflecting,
<br>
say, a voltage that has been halved by increasing the value of a resistor;
<br>
0.25 as a quarter the voltage following a further increase in resistance, etc.
<br>
Such values can be added to give the right answer, but not exactly. It is like
<br>
taking two identical chocolate bars, snapping both in half, and then swapping
<br>
one half from each. It is unlikely that either of the bars will then be
<br>
exactly the weight that the manufacturer delivered.
<br>
<p>One of the contributions of the father of the field-Carver Mead, professor
<br>
emeritus at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena-was to show
<br>
that this kind of precision was not important in neural systems, because the
<br>
eventual output was not a number but a behaviour. The crucial thing, he
<br>
argued, was that the response of the electronic circuits should be
<br>
qualitatively similar to the structures they were supposed to be emulating.
<br>
That way, each circuit of a few transistors and capacitors could &quot;compute&quot; its
<br>
reaction (by simply responding as dictated by its own physical properties)
<br>
instantly. To do the same thing, a digital computer would have to perform many
<br>
operations and have enough logic gates (circuits that recognise a 1 or a 0)
<br>
for the computation. That would make the device not only slow and
<br>
power-hungry, but also huge and expensive. For a fuller account of Carver Mead
<br>
and his unique contribution to the whole of information technology, see this
<br>
article.
<br>
<p>Another advantage of the analog approach is that, partly because of their
<br>
speed, such systems are much better at using feedback than their digital
<br>
counterparts. This allows neuromorphically designed machines to be far more
<br>
responsive to their environment than conventional robots. In short, they are
<br>
much more like the biological creatures they are seeking to emulate.
<br>
<p>Going straight
<br>
One of the many projects demonstrating this concept at the Telluride meeting
<br>
was a robot that could drive in straight lines-thanks to electronics modelled
<br>
on the optic lobe in a fly's brain. The vision chip, built by Reid Harrison at
<br>
the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, is a &quot;pixellated&quot; light sensor that
<br>
reads an image using an array of individual cells, with additional circuitry
<br>
built locally into each cell to process the incoming signals. The fact that
<br>
these processing circuits are local and analog is crucial to the device's
<br>
operation-and is a feature that is borrowed from the biological model.
<br>
<p>Dr Harrison and his supervisor at Caltech and co-founder of the Telluride
<br>
summer school, Christof Koch, identified the various processes taking place in
<br>
the so-called lamina, medulla and lobular-plate cells in a fly's brain as
<br>
being worth implementing in silicon. These cells form a system that allows the
<br>
fly to detect motion throughout most of its visual field-letting the insect
<br>
avoid obstacles and predators while compensating for its own motion.
<br>
<p>In the chip, special filters cut out any constant or ambient illumination, as
<br>
well as very high frequencies that can be the source of electronic noise in
<br>
the system. The purpose is to let the device concentrate on what is actually
<br>
changing. In a fly's brain, this filtering role is played by the lamina cells.
<br>
<p>In a fly's medulla, adjacent photodetectors are paired together, a time delay
<br>
is introduced between the signals, and the two are then multiplied together.
<br>
The length of the delay is crucial, because it sets the speed of motion that
<br>
the detector is looking for. In the chip, since the delay and the distance
<br>
between the two adjacent photo-diodes are known, the speed of an image moving
<br>
over the two detectors can be determined from the multiplier output. Large
<br>
numbers of these &quot;elementary motion detectors&quot; are then added together in the
<br>
final processing stage. This spatial integration, which is similar to that
<br>
performed in a fly's large lobular plate cells, ensures that the broad sweep
<br>
of the motion is measured, and not just local variations. The same kind of
<br>
mechanism for detecting motion is seen in the brains of cats, monkeys and even
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>To prove that the chip not only worked, but could be useful, Mr Harrison
<br>
attached it to a robot that had one of its wheels replaced by a
<br>
larger-than-normal one, making it move in circles. When instructed to move in
<br>
a straight line, feedback from the vision chip-as it computed the unexpected
<br>
sideways motion of the scenery-was fed into the robot's drive mechanism,
<br>
causing the larger wheel to compensate by turning more slowly. The result was
<br>
a robot that could move in a straight line, thanks to a vision chip that
<br>
consumed a mere five millionths of a watt of power.
<br>
<p>For comparison, the imaging device on NASA's little Sojourner Rover that
<br>
explored a few square metres of the Martian surface in 1997 consumed
<br>
three-quarters of a watt-a sizeable fraction of the robot's total power. The
<br>
image system that helps make the &quot;Marble&quot; trackball developed by Logitech of
<br>
Fremont, California, a handy replacement for a conventional computer mouse,
<br>
takes its cue likewise from a fly's vision system. In this case, the
<br>
engineering was done mainly by the Swiss Centre for Electronics and
<br>
Microtechnology in Neuchatel and Lausanne.
<br>
<p>The concept of sensory feedback is a key part of another project shown at the
<br>
Telluride workshop. In this case, a biologist, robotics engineer and
<br>
analog-chip designer collaborated on a walking robot that used the principle
<br>
of a &quot;central pattern generator&quot; (CPG)-a kind of flexible pacemaker that
<br>
humans and other animals use for locomotion. (It is a chicken's CPG that
<br>
allows it to continue running around after losing its head.) Unlike most
<br>
conventional robots, CPG-based machines can learn to walk and avoid obstacles
<br>
without an explicit map of their environment, or even their own bodies.
<br>
<p>The biological model on which the walking robot is based was developed in part
<br>
by Avis Cohen of the University of Maryland at College Park. Dr Cohen had been
<br>
studying the way that neural activity in the spinal cord of the lamprey (an
<br>
eel-shaped jawless fish) allowed it to move, with the sequential contraction
<br>
of muscles propelling it forward in a wave motion. The findings helped her
<br>
develop a CPG model that treated the different spinal segments as individual
<br>
oscillators that are coupled together to produce an overall pattern of
<br>
activity. Tony Lewis, president and chief executive of Iguana Robotics in
<br>
Mahomet, Illinois, developed this CPG model further, using it as the basis for
<br>
controlling artificial creatures.
<br>
<p>In the walking robot, the body is mainly a small pair of legs (the whole thing
<br>
is just 14cm tall) driven at the hip; the knees are left to move freely,
<br>
swinging forward under their own momentum like pendulums until they hit a stop
<br>
when the leg is straight. To make the robot walk, the hips are driven forwards
<br>
and backwards by &quot;spikes&quot; (bursts) of electrical energy triggered by the CPG.
<br>
This robot has sensors that let it feel and respond to the ground and its own
<br>
body. Because outputs from these sensors are fed directly back to the CPG, the
<br>
robot can literally learn to walk.
<br>
<p>The CPG works by charging and discharging an electrical capacitor. When an
<br>
additional set of sensors detect the extreme positions of the hips, they send
<br>
electrical spikes to the CPG's capacitor, charging it up faster or letting it
<br>
discharge more slowly, depending on where the hips are in the walking cycle.
<br>
As the robot lurches forward, like a toddler taking its first steps, the next
<br>
set of &quot;extreme spikes&quot; charge or discharge the capacitor at different parts
<br>
of the cycle. Eventually, after a bit of stumbling around, the pattern of the
<br>
CPG's charging and discharging and the pattern of the electrical spikes from
<br>
the sensors at the robot's hip joints begin to converge in a process known as
<br>
&quot;entrainment&quot;. At that point, the robot is walking like a human, but with a
<br>
gait that matches the physical properties of its own legs.
<br>
<p>Walking is only the start. Mr Lewis has endowed his robot with an ability to
<br>
learn how to step over obstacles (see photo, top). It does this by changing
<br>
the length of the three strides before the object, using miniature cameras as
<br>
eyes, and the same kind of interaction with the CPG that it uses to
<br>
synchronise its hip movement for normal walking.
<br>
<p>The interesting thing is that the obstacle does not have to be defined in any
<br>
way. It appears simply as an unexpected change in the flow of visual
<br>
information from the cameras that the robot uses to see with. This makes the
<br>
technique extremely powerful: in theory, it could be applied to lots of other
<br>
forms of sensory input. Another factor that makes this project impressive is
<br>
that its key component-the CPG chip, designed by Ralph Etienne-Cummings of
<br>
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland-consumes less than a millionth
<br>
of a watt of power.
<br>
<p>The efficiency of CPG-based systems for locomotion has captured commercial
<br>
attention. For the first time, parents can now buy their children analog
<br>
&quot;creatures&quot;, thanks to Mark Tilden, a robotics expert at Los Alamos National
<br>
Laboratory in New Mexico. Hasbro, one of America's largest toy makers, is
<br>
marketing a product called BIO Bugs based on Dr Tilden's biomechanical
<br>
machines.

<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
