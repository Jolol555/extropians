<em>&gt;     &gt; My personal opinion at this point, for whatever it's worth, is that John
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Clark has lost the current argument between himself and Samantha, having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; resorted to ad homonym arguments without provocation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok Eliezer, it's time to put your money where your mouth is. I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see you say with a straight face that
</em><br>
[thirty lines of strawman arguments]
<br>
<em>&gt; So Eliezer pick one of the above statement, I don't care which one, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend it. I dare you!
</em><br>
<p>Some non-strawman arguments - which I may not defend myself, but which I
<br>
offer up in the interest of showing those points that you might have dared
<br>
me to defend if you were being a little more rational about all this - are
<br>
these:
<br>
<p>1)  The US intervention in Afghanistan is doing more harm than good.
<br>
2)  A superior strategy for the US would have been to turn the other
<br>
cheek, thus gaining moral superiority and showing the world that we don't
<br>
always bomb people we don't like.
<br>
3)  The number of dead Afghan civilians has vastly exceeded the number of
<br>
dead American civilians, and this puts the US in the wrong.
<br>
4)  What happened to the US was directly caused by the US carrying out an
<br>
inconsistent and immoral strategy in foreign relations over the past fifty
<br>
years.
<br>
5)  The US is currently in the grip of a fever of destructive hatred and
<br>
this hatred is both morally wrong and strategically counterproductive,
<br>
regardless of all other moral issues involved.
<br>
6)  Bin Laden may not have had just cause to blow up the World Trade
<br>
Center, but a lot of Middle East citizens have reason to be pretty annoyed
<br>
at the US - perhaps more reason to be annoyed at the US than the US has
<br>
reason to be annoyed at Bin Laden.
<br>
7)  It would be wrong to impose US culture on Afghanistan as retaliation
<br>
for the World Trade Center Attack.  (I do *not* believe this; see below.)
<br>
8)  Technology, science, and the Internet are mere artifacts of Western
<br>
culture which don't belong to the ancient Afghan traditions - rather than
<br>
being the products of intelligence itself and therefore the universal
<br>
heritage of every human on the planet, regardless of what the Taliban
<br>
believes about the &quot;Westernness&quot; of technology, as the result of temporary
<br>
differentials in technological advancement that happen to be correlated
<br>
with different cultures.  (I believe the latter.)
<br>
<p>Regardless of whether they are *right* or *wrong*, the above propositions
<br>
are not *idiotic*, and your use of the term &quot;idiot&quot; is therefore purely ad
<br>
hominem.  Samantha attacked your ideas; she didn't attack you.  You should
<br>
have launched a counterattack on her ideas, not attacked her personally.
<br>
<p>My own beliefs center mostly around the belief that &quot;cultures&quot; exist
<br>
mostly in the imaginations of Western academia.  I'm sorry if the Afghans
<br>
have a rich cultural tradition that is hundreds of years old; their
<br>
government harbored a terrorist organization trying to get nuclear
<br>
weapons, and that takes precedence.  So, yes, I think Samantha Atkins and
<br>
Amara Graps are wrong.  But I don't think they're stupid and I AM TIRED OF
<br>
SEEING EXTROPIANS CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES.  We're supposed to be smarter
<br>
than this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not a case of disagreeing with a colleague, this crap is brain dead dumb, on a pare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with flying saucers, perpetual motion machines and the lost city of Atlantis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forget about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity, if the bilge Samantha Atkins spews out were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be adopted you and I and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody we know would be dead in less than a decade.
</em><br>
<p>I most strongly doubt it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course it's possible that you're right and I have lost this argument, if so it's because I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a poor debater not because I'm wrong.
</em><br>
<p>If the world really is at stake, then you are obliged to be a good debater
<br>
*in addition to* being correct.  But then that's a side issue; I think
<br>
you're wrong.
