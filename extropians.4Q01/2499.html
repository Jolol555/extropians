</em><br>
<p>First, I would like to point out that I did not say you really have
<br>
Anton's syndrome. US just *looks* like it has it. 
<br>
<p>That Europe is off the map is another issue - 
<br>
<p>(since I'm some kind of chimeric hybrid between european and american
<br>
culture culture I have no problem at all with disagreeing with and
<br>
liking both)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My view on European policies, over the last several decades are this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe was soft on nazism, when it was in full bloom. Yes, much of the USA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was also, but not to the degree Europe was, and they had reason to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-nazi more urgently. Perhaps their bargains with the Reich, even if it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought war to their own countries are Still, not considered, such a bad, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bargain? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe was opportunistic, for business when the Soviet Union was in power, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and leftist demonstrators were anti-American and pro-Soviet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Concurrently throughout this period they have catered to the middle eastern 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil states, past 1956, thus, inadvertently assisting in development of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radical, religious, Islam. I also remember how many Euro business catered to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sadam's war machine, and wonder how many still do?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, how much European history do you know? Many governments in the 30's
<br>
were extremely authoritarian and corporativist (including the US; study
<br>
The New Deal), and the dominant ideologies at that time were fascism and
<br>
socialism - if you were an intellectual and asked what the ideology of
<br>
the future were, you would most likely answer one of those. Liberals
<br>
like Popper and Hayek were fringe.
<br>
<p>That Europe was opportunistic isn't strange (look at how NATO formed),
<br>
although trade with the Soviet union was a fairly small trickle in the
<br>
west.  As for the demonstrators in the 60's and 70's, yes, they were
<br>
very much pro-Soviet or at least anti-american - for a whole bunch of
<br>
reasons, but essentially the same as have been mentioned earlier.
<br>
Antiamericanism has a *long* tradition in Europe by now, and is firmly
<br>
entrenched in media, politics and culture. In a way it is also a remnant
<br>
from the cold war, since (obviously) it was supported by the pro-Soviet
<br>
left, but there is enough cultural friction even without it to keep it
<br>
going indefinitely.
<br>
<p>As for Europe supporting the middle east, I think you should remember
<br>
how that system was set up and how spheres of influence were
<br>
distributed; to a large extent the postwar Europe simply agreed to
<br>
support the US hegemony. The same complaints that are levelled at the US
<br>
for causing the current situation can of course be aimed at Europe. As
<br>
for Saddam, again you should remember that the US supplied him with
<br>
weapons during the war against Iran - it is Bin Laden all over again.
<br>
<p>To sum up: yes, Europe has had a blemished foreign policy too. No
<br>
surprise there. Europe isn't better than the US, but at least it has a
<br>
different perspective. And that is really what is the problem here:
<br>
having a different perspective doesn't fit into the current simplistic
<br>
&quot;if you aren't with us you are against us&quot; mood. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An I anti-European, no matter what? Lets say I am very distrustful, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paranoid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are Europeans anti-American, no matter what? Some, sure seem to be. Again is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it truth or merely perceptions?
</em><br>
<p>Most Europeans aren't anti-American per se, they are just distrustful
<br>
and sometimes a bit paranoid. But there is a long intellectual history
<br>
of lambasting the US for everything bad. The right did it too (and of
<br>
course attacked the Soviet Union even more), the left toned down the
<br>
Soviet criticism and wholeheartedly criticized the US for everything it
<br>
did. This has deeply influenced media (you would be surprised how much
<br>
newspaper articles in Sweden mainly dwell on the bad sides of US
<br>
society), and of course percolated into society. If you ask most Swedes,
<br>
I think they assume that self interest, disregarding the rest of the
<br>
world, is a primary motivator for all US foreign policy.
<br>
<p>And remember - we are your *allies*. Now think about the rest of the
<br>
world. 
<br>
<p>It is also interesting to think about the current situation reflected in
<br>
a world where China has emerged as an economic superpower sometime in
<br>
the 2010-2020 region (you know, the time where so much dangerous nano is
<br>
expected to be developed). Will anti-americanism still be a strong
<br>
motivator by then?
