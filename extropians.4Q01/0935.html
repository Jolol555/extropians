<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;     &gt; From where I sit the US is quite interested in a war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's ridiculous, there is no reason America would want any war right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, much less a &quot;major and  indefinite&quot; one. Do you think Americans just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woke up one fine day and thought &quot; You know what I'd really like, I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule the poorest country in the world, Afghanistan&quot;? It's not complicated, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to look for hidden motives, we are at war because somebody is trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to kill us and they've already made a very good start.
</em><br>
<p>Then tell me exactly why we are talking about an indeterminate
<br>
war against an unknown number of targets in an unknown number of
<br>
countries.  Such a war should be shouted down immediately.  But
<br>
it isn't.  Why?  As bad as 911 was such a response is overboard
<br>
and overly broad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Are you utterly sure some elements of your own  country are not planting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;just enough anthrax to create a scare and justify going after the next target?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, and flying saucer crashed in New Mexico 50 years ago and there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies of aliens in a freezer at a Air Force base, and we learned how to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microprocessors from the debris of that crash, and JFK is still alive, Elvis too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and CIA satellites are beaming thoughts into my head, and black helicopters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are chasing me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Laugh if you want to but it is a much more complicated world
<br>
than blase assumptions that we are the good guys and those are
<br>
the &quot;evil ones&quot; would lead you to believe. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Our campaign is massively dishonest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting, one side crashed two civilian jetliners into the two largest civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office buildings in the world, the same side sends letters laced with anthrax to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent people, the same side makes it a crime to educate women,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that's not the side you call &quot;massively dishonest&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We do not know there is any terrorism plot behind the anthrax
<br>
scare according to experts.  Nor do we have evidence saying it
<br>
is done by any particular group that is more than extremely
<br>
flimsy.  That the Taliban are nasty folks does not say they are
<br>
responsible for all ills nor that an endless campaign that goes
<br>
substantially beyond Afghanistan is in the least justified.  Not
<br>
to mention the eviscerating of our own civil liberties.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;and  ill-defined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say American foreign policy has not been better defined in my lifetime,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's do what you have to do in order to stay alive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is not what we are doing exactly.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Something is driving us beyond the horror of 911.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting, over six thousand  have been butchered but you can't understand why that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be enough to make us do what we have done. I hope I'm not accused of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impolite by saying this because I consider it an objective fact, Madam you are a fool.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You hope no such thing.  The response is overboard.  You are
<br>
being determinedly blind. IMHO of course.
