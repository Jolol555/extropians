<em>&gt; In considering the information loss associated with an abortion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one may wish to balance that against the information loss that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurs with the incarceration of 28% of the black and 16% of the

</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what the connection to abortion is, but I'll take the
<br>
opportunity anyway to repeat that the War on Drugs is the #1 threat
<br>
to extropy.  Not only are the lives and information content of the
<br>
men (and increasingly women) imprisoned for drugs destroyed, prison
<br>
teaches them how to be maximally entropic forces upon release --
<br>
to say nothing about the damage done to our institutions and the
<br>
terror and destruction visited upon less fortunate countries as a
<br>
result.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; One might even go so far in a really extropic society as to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility of reproduction until one has been sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educated that one has a moderately successful chance of raising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing members of society.  The idea of allowing people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive other peoples lives before having demonstrated an ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to successfully drive their own makes very little sense to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course this raises the question of whether humans have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental right to create really screwed up lives for other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.
</em><br>
<p>There should be an _option_ for both sexes to be sterilized
<br>
(especially men, vasectomy is much less invasive and easier to
<br>
reverse than tubal ligation) just before reproduction is possible.
<br>
Reversal technology is improving rapidly, and should be more than
<br>
ready for today's youth once they are ready in all senses to
<br>
reproduce and parent in a couple decades.  Caveat:  I don't know
<br>
how early sterilization could be done without disrupting development,
<br>
and I doubt much research has been done to find out.
