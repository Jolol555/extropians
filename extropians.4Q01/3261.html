<p>I thoroughly disagree. The fact is that WWII was to be a war against
<br>
fascism. In 1945 we chose to avoid further use of nuclear weapons
<br>
against the last two adherents of fascism (the Soviet Union and
<br>
Communist China) in favor of a long period of low intensity conflict. We
<br>
demonstrated the lethality of the weapons on two targets to shorten the
<br>
war on Japan specifically and cheapen the cost of turning that
<br>
archipelago into a base of operations in the cold war on the remaining
<br>
fascist powers. Without this demonstration of the destructiveness of
<br>
nuclear weapons, I think that we would have wound up in a full scale
<br>
nuclear conflict with the USSR by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis
<br>
specifically because the lack of those examples in Japan would have
<br>
caused both the governments and the people of both sides to severely
<br>
underestimate how terrible nuclear weapons truly are. Both sides would
<br>
have convinced themselves that nuclear war was fightable and winnable in
<br>
the context of the sort of high intensity conflict experienced during
<br>
WWII.
<br>
<p>Thus, our bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki served great purpose to
<br>
humankind.
