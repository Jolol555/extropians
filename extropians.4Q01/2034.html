<em>&gt; ### Yes!
</em><br>
<p>As a radical individualist, I say no. Groupism is only justified as an
<br>
emergency response to outside threats (i.e. the current war on
<br>
terrorism). Outside of that, groups of any kind can and should be
<br>
treated with suspicion as threats to individual liberty.
<br>
<p>### As an individual I recognize, at the basic level, nothing higher in
<br>
value that my individual life and liberty. However, no matter whether I want
<br>
it or not, suprahuman levels of organization, like corporate entities, do
<br>
emerge spontaneously due to their ability to extend the survival of their
<br>
constituent parts and their own.
<br>
<p>I find it hard to deny that an industrial company is more than just a few
<br>
thousand individuals working together. A secretary doesn't create a business
<br>
plan, neither do executives - it is the carefully choreographed interaction
<br>
of all the employees that adds value to their individual efforts and allows
<br>
them to transcend the limitations of their minds and bodies. The way people
<br>
are selected to advance in the corporate ladder, and are being molded to fit
<br>
the corporate identity, and ideals, is not dependent solely on the wishes of
<br>
individuals - it is the invisible hand of the corporation, choosing the cogs
<br>
to fit its survival goals within the larger context of the society.
<br>
<p>No matter how attached we are to our individualistic ideals, we cannot
<br>
escape the forces shaping our society, just as participants in a free market
<br>
economy cannnot escape the impersonal forces ruling it.
<br>
<p>I agree that careful scrutiny of suprahuman entities is necessary, as long
<br>
as it remains possible. But, since we cannot abolish the corporate and state
<br>
levels of organization, we might best benefit by taming the beast rather
<br>
than trying to turn the tide. Groupism is the unavoidable effect of human
<br>
cooperation at any level higher than simple exchange of favors. In a
<br>
carefully crafted legal system, allowing corporate activity while limiting
<br>
their power to a level which can still be controlled, and maintaining
<br>
maximal transparency of their internal workings, we as individuals can
<br>
achieve much more freedom than our free-range forebears.
