Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities and Software
<br>
Steven Johnson
<br>
288pp, Penguin, £14.99
<br>
<p>Harvester ants aren't particularly bright. Yet colonies of these creatures
<br>
gather food, fight off enemies, deposit rubbish and fallen comrades in neat
<br>
heaps outside their nests, and generally pull off some of the most amazing
<br>
feats of engineering in the animal kingdom. How do colonies achieve all this
<br>
when the brains of their members are so limited? It is tempting to think that
<br>
the queen understands the master plan and in some way coordinates her minions,
<br>
but in reality she's just as thick as they are. No one, it seems, is pulling
<br>
the colony's strings, so how does it manage to function as a whole?
<br>
<p>The answer may lie in self-organisation, a phenomenon explored by Steven
<br>
Johnson in his mind-expanding Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains,
<br>
Cities and Software. In its most basic form, a self-organising system
<br>
comprises many simple elements whose individual behaviours are determined by
<br>
local conditions. A worker ant may stumble across a colleague's pheromone
<br>
trail communicating the message &quot;out foraging&quot;. If such trails are dense on
<br>
the ground, the encountering ant may stop collecting food and begin taking out
<br>
the trash instead. Alternatively, if the frequency of &quot;out foraging&quot; messages
<br>
is low, the ant may respond by striking out along a trail that says, by smell,
<br>
&quot;food over here&quot;, and begin collecting again. Provided individuals stick to
<br>
their respective rules, seemingly intelligent behaviour by the colony as a
<br>
whole can emerge without any ant being the wiser.
<br>
<p>This type of self-organisation is now recognised in many systems composed of
<br>
numerous elements or modules capable of performing relatively simple
<br>
behaviours in response to local stimuli. &quot;Bottom-up&quot; forces probably play a
<br>
crucial role in shaping the nature of cities, leading to the creation of
<br>
suburbs, slums, business centres and other unplanned demographic clusters. No
<br>
one decreed that Savile Row should house London's finest tailors, for example;
<br>
the character of the street emerged as a result of decisions taken by
<br>
individual businesses about such things as profile, supply lines and customer
<br>
bases. Similarly, the silk weavers of Florence began to congregate unbidden on
<br>
the Por Santa Maria in the 11th century and are still plying their trade there
<br>
today, despite the coming and going of wars, plagues, fires and massive social
<br>
upheavals. Cities seem to have emergent lives of their own, governed by the
<br>
usually unwitting actions of their inhabitants over many generations. We are
<br>
the ants, in other words, and cities are our colonies.
<br>
<p>Warming to his metropolitan theme, Johnson then asks a seemingly ludicrous
<br>
question: can cities learn? Learning is usually associated with conscious
<br>
beings, but then an immune system &quot;learns&quot; throughout its owner's lifetime,
<br>
adapting and manufacturing antibodies to counter the threat of invading
<br>
pathogens. This type of learning seems to revolve around information-storage
<br>
and a certain responsiveness to change, so there may indeed be a sense -
<br>
albeit rather a narrow one - in which cities too can be said to learn.
<br>
<p>If you think this is esoteric stuff, read on. &quot;If cities can generate emergent
<br>
intelligence, a macro-behavior spawned by a million micromotives,&quot; Johnson
<br>
muses, &quot;what higher-level form is currently taking shape among the routers and
<br>
fiber-optic lines of the internet?&quot; Might the world wide web become a &quot;global
<br>
brain&quot;? Will emergent intelligence, or even self-awareness, arise unbidden in
<br>
cyberspace? Controlling the net is hard enough at present, but what if it
<br>
starts getting ideas of its own? If, like me, you feel an overwhelming urge to
<br>
head for the nearest unplugged island when cybergeeks start banging on about
<br>
our technological future, this is an occasion to resist. Johnson's
<br>
speculations about life on the internet, machine intelligence, computer
<br>
programs that evolve on their own, feedback loops in modern media networks and
<br>
so on are intelligent, witty and tremendously thought-provoking. And his
<br>
conclusions will probably surprise you.
<br>
<p>Emergence is a fascinating book, full of surprises and insights, and written
<br>
in an easy, engaging style. However, you may have to read it more than once to
<br>
appreciate its subtleties. The significance of emergent behaviour is made
<br>
admirably clear in the case of insects, slime moulds and even cities, but
<br>
grasping its relevance to the Gennifer Flowers affair and the operation of
<br>
internet chatrooms is a bit more challenging. The connections are there, but
<br>
Johnson is rather sparing with the signposts. He also tends to place them less
<br>
than helpfully towards the end of chapters, requiring the reader, finally
<br>
enlightened, to go back and reconsider all the earlier spadework. Still,
<br>
popular-science books interesting enough to read twice don't come along all
<br>
that often.
