Stephen Hawking's Doomsday Prediction Called 'Regrettable Hype'
<br>

By Robert Roy Britt
<br>
<p>An expert on doomsday scenarios said Stephen Hawking's latest apocalypse
<br>
prediction -- humans would not survive the next 1,000 years -- was &quot;fatalistic
<br>
and highly unlikely.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hawking raised the threat of biological engineering in saying humans must
<br>
colonize space or face an end as a species. The comments came in an interview
<br>
with the British Daily Telegraph newspaper, published Oct. 16.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we
<br>
spread into space,&quot; Hawking told the Daily Telegraph. &quot;There are too many
<br>
accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We
<br>
will reach out to the stars.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hawking, 59 and considered one of the most brilliant physicists and
<br>
cosmologists of all time, cited nuclear technology as one threat. But he said
<br>
there is an even greater danger.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the long term, I am more worried about biology,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>The comment comes at a time when all of America and much of the world is
<br>
focused on the threat of bioterrorism in the wake of several cases of Anthrax
<br>
infection.
<br>
<p>Hope for humanity
<br>
Benny Peiser, an expert in apocalyptic movements and neocatastrophism at
<br>
Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, criticized Hawking for
<br>
increasingly unfounded and erratic doomsday prophesies.
<br>
<p>Peiser told SPACE.com he thought Hawking's words constituted &quot;regrettable
<br>
hype.&quot;
<br>
<p>Peiser also provided the text of a letter he has sent to the editor of the
<br>
Daily Telegraph.
<br>
<p>&quot;Stephen Hawking's predictions of terrestrial doom have become increasingly
<br>
wide-ranging and unreasonable in recent years,&quot; Peiser writes. &quot;They also
<br>
manifest a certain arbitrariness in his choice of end-time scenarios.&quot;
<br>
<p>A year ago, Hawking warned that global warming would make Earth as deadly a
<br>
place as Venus, also saying humanity might not survive the next 1,000 years.
<br>
Peiser called Hawking's latest prediction &quot;both fatalistic and highly
<br>
unlikely. It also violates scientific risk assessments commonly used for
<br>
hazard estimation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ability to cope
<br>
Peiser said apocalyptics typically exaggerate possible future dangers while
<br>
ignoring or underestimating the probability of finding a social, technological
<br>
or medical remedy for any given predicament.
<br>
<p>&quot;The risks of genetic engineering or bioterrorism are genuine,&quot; Peiser says.
<br>
&quot;But like all the other major hazards, they need to be evaluated and weighed
<br>
up against our increasing capabilities to control and influence life, nature
<br>
and society.&quot;
<br>
<p>Peiser draws on history for examples of our steadfastness as a species. &quot;For
<br>
more than 5 million years, hominids and human beings have survived recurring
<br>
onslaughts of ice ages, global catastrophes due to asteroidal and cometary
<br>
impacts as well as global plague epidemics,&quot; he points out.
<br>
<p>&quot;Technological and societal evolution has now reached a level of complexity
<br>
that renders the probability of human survival for the next 1,000 years
<br>
drastically higher than at any previous stage of our long history.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
