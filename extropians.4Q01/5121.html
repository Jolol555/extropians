<em>&gt; This seems like an odd way to view things.  If you get twice as many

</em><br>
<p>The exchange rate of the $A to $US may be roughly 2:1, but that doesn't
<br>
mean the purchasing power of an Australian dollar in Australia is any
<br>
different from the purchasing power of a US dollar in the US.  A bizarre
<br>
state of affairs, really - you'd think everybody in the United States
<br>
would move to Australia, or all the goods in Australia would be exported
<br>
to the United States - but there it is, a testament to the unfinished
<br>
business of building an inertialess global economy.
