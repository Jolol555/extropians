<em>&gt; &gt; Sorry, Mike, but when trials are closed, it's too easy to accuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone of being anything, whether they are or not.  PUBLIC trials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for all offenses are a fundamental human right everywhere, under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all conditions, without exception.  Anyone who proposes closed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trials for any reason is an enemy of freedom and justice.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, public trials for all offenses, provided the accused agrees to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrender for trial with no caveats. If someone refuses to be captured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and remains a threat, how far should others risk their lives just so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can have their trial whether they want it or not?
</em><br>
<p>What does apprehension of the accused have to do with anything?  If
<br>
the charge is sufficiently serious, and a judge has issued an arrest
<br>
warrant, then by all means an accused should be hunted down, physically
<br>
seized, and brought to trial whether he likes it or not, and if he is
<br>
killed in the attempt by a cop or citizen acting in self-defense, well,
<br>
that's OK too, though certainly less desirable.  I've never said
<br>
anything different.  Please stay on topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There are certainly some aspects of the American judicial system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that can be changed: jury selection, rules of evidence, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; procedural details.  But openness isn't one of them: if anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; American trials should be _more_ open: ALL of them, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those for suspected foreign terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, so you think that jury members identities should be public knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for terrorism trials? How naive.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I also think that (a) jury service should be voluntary, and (b)
<br>
conviction doesn't necessarily have to be unanimous.  Given both of
<br>
those reforms the risk of retribution is minimized.  In reality, though,
<br>
even under the present system criminals rarely target prosecutors, judges,
<br>
and juries; typically a criminal defendent who loses will blame his own
<br>
counsel, and occasionally one or more witnesses.
