Mark commented on my being too easily satisfied with my &quot;Extropian
<br>
ethics&quot; (morality) and posed a number of important questions.
<br>
I would tend to place most of his questions in the areas of
<br>
Extropian Epistimology or Extropian Aesthetics.  I would
<br>
sum up his questions with the problem of how does one choose
<br>
between the relative values of the orthoganal vectors:
<br>
&quot;more&quot;, &quot;different&quot; and &quot;better&quot;.  I would say that I
<br>
do not have answers -- I myself tend to lean towards
<br>
different and better, but thats just me.  It seems to
<br>
me that the development path phase space is so huge
<br>
it will never be explored completely.  It seems likely
<br>
that one has to choose a vector an explore it, realizing
<br>
you may have to forsake the exploration of other areas.
<br>
<p>Since there are many people on the list who have much better
<br>
backgrounds in philosophy I will leave Mark's questions to
<br>
their exploration.  It is certainly true that each of them
<br>
could spawn a long discussion.  Perhaps something to consider
<br>
for Extro 6.
