</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Once again you don't know what you are talking about.  Bush has
<br>
clearly stated that there are no limits to his notion of the war
<br>
until all terrorist groups and their adherents are exposed and
<br>
eliminated in however many countries they may be in or supported
<br>
by especially in the Middle East.  The above is nonsense when
<br>
hundreds of thousand are fleeing the country and some 7 million
<br>
people might well starve to death if food is not brought in
<br>
before the onset of winter.

<p>Please keep your insults to yourself.
