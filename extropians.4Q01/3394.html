<em>&gt; They are against cloning, IVF and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortion because they are sides of the same big concept: humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling human reproduction. To the religious, this throws out God
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the circuit, to the green it throws out the wisdom of nature and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the general romantic it suggests that we put our reason and planning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above the natural. That is the core value ideas that underly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance; while some who share these values may also be strategic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinkers, most opponents simply argue against cloning because they think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>In addition to the church, the greens, and the romantics, the state opposes it
<br>
because cloning would complicate the business of ruling citizens, who may
<br>
accomplish some interesting tricks via impersonating each other. If
<br>
fingerprints can be swapped with synthetic grafts molded from imprints of
<br>
another's fingers, this would remove the last obstacle to replicating
<br>
identities that unique fingerprints comprise. A clone could then assume the
<br>
legal and professional identity of its parent, either as a twin, or as a
<br>
descendent. Plus, crafty parents could transfer their indentity to
<br>
children/clones, again and again, thus establishing identity dynasties which
<br>
could circumvent statutory limitations and wreak all sorts of havoc.
<br>
Essentially, this could make an individual identity immortal, like a
<br>
corporation, which continues forever with new bodies assuming the same
<br>
identity. Call it the Perennial Clone Syndrome: perpetual entitlements and
<br>
ownership (which would make Strom Thurmond's career seem short). Also, the
<br>
state does not cherish the notion of a single identity being in more than one
<br>
place at one time, nor the possibility that several identical people could get
<br>
away with paying taxes as one individual. For example, if a billionaire had
<br>
several clones instead of children, the money would not need to be transferred
<br>
to separate clone/children accounts, since they could access the money as if
<br>
they were all the same billionaire.
