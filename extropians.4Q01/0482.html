<p>Which is one of the main reasons they have been persecuted from time to
<br>
time, of course. Although some of them, such

as Mansur al-Hallaj, seem to have gone out of the way to enrage the
<br>
traditional believers (saying &quot;I am the Truth/God&quot; was not exactly
<br>
diplomatic, even if the meaning is fairly obvious to any mystic).
<br>
<p>To get back to extropian issues, I think there is a lot of practical
<br>
wisdom out there in traditions such as sufism. How to make the best use
<br>
of it in our development as transhumans? My experience is that it is
<br>
very healthy to have been at least exposed to different such traditions
<br>
1) in order to learn about how other people think and perceive the
<br>
world, 2) in order to recognize the underlying similarities, which are
<br>
applicable to oneself regardless of what religious or epistemic
<br>
framework one uses.
