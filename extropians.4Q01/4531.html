<em>&gt; I think it was Eric who mentioned that Dr Allan Snyder is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also autistic. Cf.:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.centreforthemind.com/newsmedia/whatshot/">http://www.centreforthemind.com/newsmedia/whatshot/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't seen any statement from the brilliant Dr Snyder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this is so, but it certainly explains some of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more... unusual... behavior at a public dinner I attended a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while back. He introduces himself, especially to attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women, by mentioning as swiftly and insistently as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he's a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (an unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction, it's true, for an American.) His persona is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egregiously self-promoting, and his Centre for the Mind in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia frequently emits brazen promotional emails to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone they regard as interested parties, detailing his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latest triumphs, TV appearances, etc. If he is indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autistic (which seems not quite right, since he buttonholes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people rather than avoiding their gaze), this might help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain his social gaucheness. Would he wish this purported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact trumpeted about him? Maybe--he's not shy about acting it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, I suppose.
</em><br>
<p><p>you seem to miss the psychiatric terminology.
<br>
autism is a disablity in informational interchange.
<br>
there can be verbal autism, emotional autism, social autism,
<br>
and even musical or visual autism, informatical autism and so 
<br>
on, one of common forms of autism is dyslexia and dysgraphia.
<br>
autism can occur at almost every level of human communications.
<br>
<p>i understand your confusion, psychiatry had major changes 
<br>
recently, i wait for DSM to be rewritten, so there will be 
<br>
again common base of definitions.
<br>
<p>i saw the BBC program which was mentioned on the page, and it 
<br>
was clear for me that snyders have severe problems with 
<br>
artistic behaviours - he cannot draw, nor compose music. 
<br>
i understand that he is autistic due to paranoid reaction to US 
<br>
goverement (or what forces him to not use drugs to treat his 
<br>
illnes? dunno. i can't call him, i doubt he'll understand my 
<br>
lousy accent :P maybe he is simply afraid of side effects?)
<br>
<p>he called artists 'geniuses' - had a autistic (verbal autism?)
<br>
guy in his program which drawed hyperrealistic sketches - it is 
<br>
nowhere close to genius, just because he not creates any new 
<br>
information, which is considered in artistic circles as 
<br>
'copism' (from word 'copy'), so he is very skilled, but not 
<br>
genius, while snyders don't get anything from his drawings, 
<br>
whose clearly say 'i am good enough, give me a life, i want to 
<br>
come down and see more beauty, because i started to copy'...
<br>
dunno i don't know long enough his patient to say for sure :P
<br>
<p>other patient in this program was guided by (also artistically) 
<br>
disabled woman. 
<br>
it is a common misunderstanding, a psychopath and neurotic, 
<br>
psychopath (disabled doctor) wants to absorb shapes or sounds, 
<br>
and neurotic (patient) want someone who listen or see the 
<br>
images - someone who'll UNDERSTAND. this is why neurosis arises 
<br>
also in doctor - he want to 'rise' the social status of his 
<br>
victim by saying 'you're genius' which is obviously worthless 
<br>
for patient (it appears that instead of using his skills for 
<br>
expanding creative ablities of those who can easily create but 
<br>
cannot put it into form they simple search for applause - a 
<br>
behaviour induced by neuriosis of doctor)
<br>
<p>gee.. mental illnes ISN'T FUN.
<br>
<p><p>Snyder is artistically disabled - he didn't presented his 
<br>
works, he isn't even a DJ (which is fairly easy nowadays, not 
<br>
like about 20 years ago, when psychiatry started to develop)
<br>
<p>and _wants to change his neurochemistry_ or damage his brain to 
<br>
achieve power of _recreation_ (not creation! - and this is why 
<br>
snyders is lost in space) 
<br>
or maybe he is only a mad scientist which 'wants to know'
<br>
(but why he is not using usenet?, someone would enlight him if 
<br>
he'll act lame enough)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I think that announcing one's autism or Aspergerish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature might prove, at least in the short term, the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent of confessing to being a kleptomaniac or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compulsive womanizer. The public might tend thereafter to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregard one's utterances, however unfairly (especially if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they involve plans to tear down the solar system for spare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts).
</em><br>
<p>and there is other purpose for solar system? come on... :D
<br>
<p>i think it is better to know in which field one is disabled. 
<br>
you can help someone them, or not require something which is 
<br>
obviously inpossible for one to make (i.e. i'll abstain from 
<br>
judging quality of pictures in his neurochemistry books (if 
<br>
he'll write some), instead i can aim his interest in computer 
<br>
graphics, or maybe foward adress of bored graphican, also i'll 
<br>
rather try to describe my thoughs when writing to him instead 
<br>
of sending funny alegoric picture :P)
<br>
<p>ofcourse idiots have their own scales, but they're idiots, they 
<br>
don't count to _society_ so you again confuse the 
<br>
terms.(they're so called 'passive members', or 'statists')
<br>
<p>again i'll look on kleptomaniacs hands when he'll leave my 
<br>
house, and don't call police, if i'll know he have kleptomania 
<br>
disorder (but i can easily get rid of useless things  :P)
<br>
<p>if i'll know someone is compulsive womanizer i'll suggest a 
<br>
less agressive dress to my woman rather than red one, and'll 
<br>
sure call him if there will be any good orgy around ;P
