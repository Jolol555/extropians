</em><br>
<p>Unclear.  There are multiple types of chromosomal damage.
<br>
Single base damage leading to mutations can be caused by UV,
<br>
free radicals as well as genotoxins (aflotoxin and some other
<br>
plant toxins come to mind).  Double strand breaks can be
<br>
caused by radiation damage or simple probability functions
<br>
associated with the likelyhood of two single-strand breaks
<br>
in close proximity.  [There are beginning to be detailed studies
<br>
in these areas, I'm not up-to-date on the current state of research.]
<br>
<p>It isn't clear to me the degree to which &quot;rough handling&quot; can
<br>
contribute to single-strand or double-strand breaks (presumably
<br>
the single-base mutations are minimal -- *unless* the chemicals
<br>
used to induce parthenogenesis are in some way genotoxic).
<br>
<p>Clearly there is enough energy in &quot;nuclear&quot; or &quot;chromosomal&quot;
<br>
manipulation to break the covalent bonds in DNA strands --
<br>
it just isn't clear to what extent those energies are actually
<br>
transmitted to cause breaks during the expriments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, this process is mainly going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit women since the amount of damage to sperm cells is likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Women appear to have a significant advantage of
<br>
reduced damage using these methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think his (Leon Kass) chief argument here is that we see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commodization of life, and that leads to us undervaluing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value of real human lives.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly enough, this requires that one view the value of
<br>
human life in the pre-programmed following of &quot;traditional&quot;
<br>
human lives -- and *not* in the exploration of what human lives
<br>
might be capable of.  Its an implicitly static view of what
<br>
human life is or can be.  One would expect that Kass would
<br>
also be opposed to extreme sports of any kind.
