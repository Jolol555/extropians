<em>&gt; You could see it as a backup system that kicks in when everything else

</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside the known facts, personal experience and especially about incidents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that do not fit into the known facts. Not enough specification to construct
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, actually that's plenty of specification.  But I'm not sure Samantha
<br>
would agree with your definition.  There's nothing mystical about a
<br>
cognitive process like that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It also acts as a buffer between reality and emotions like fear, anger,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happyness and grief. Oh, I think you should first look what this emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff is. Where it does come from, how it works, which parts of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind we are talking about. Ahem, you know emotions, do you?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I do.  I have no difficulty at all in describing emotions.  If that
<br>
is what Samantha is talking about then she is using a needlessly mystical
<br>
term for it.  Perhaps it *is* what she's talking about, but I don't think
<br>
that she *thinks* that's what she's talking about; so I'm asking, and will
<br>
continue to ask until I get enough data that I can be fairly confident I
<br>
know what Samantha thinks she's talking about.  She may not be able to put
<br>
words to her feelings, or may not wish to put words to her feelings, but
<br>
I'm fairly confident that I can put words to her feelings once I know what
<br>
they are.  After all, I take more than a casual interest in explicit
<br>
descriptions of cognitive processes.
