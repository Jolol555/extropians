</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I did not say that it was the root.  I said it was an utterly
<br>
unnecessary affront in an already brittle region.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Stop manipulating the governments of countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mean do something that no other country has ever done, or even tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do in the entire history of the world? It's not going to happen nor should it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I stated it too lightly.  We have directly disrupted and
<br>
destroyed the duly elected government of various nations and
<br>
installed our people who would agree to our manipulations in
<br>
their place.  We have used assasination and blatant terrorism in
<br>
some cases, in the process.  In all such cases I am aware of we
<br>
acted in ways we brand illegal and terrorist if they were done
<br>
or attempted on us.  Every country does not do this and even if
<br>
they did, it would still be clearly wrong and against our stated
<br>
ideals to do so.  It is also clearly a perfectly valid reason
<br>
for peoples so affected to be damn pissed off at us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;Stop bombing Iraq and lift the sanctions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha I beg you, consider the implications of what you are saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Hussein's Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today he would also own of the first and third largest too and thus control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world economy if he hadn't been defeated militarily (and I'll bet you
</em><br>
<p>Tough.  Do you believe in free enterprise or not?  Do you
<br>
believe that if someone you don't like owns resources you need
<br>
that that justifies going in and snatching them or doing your
<br>
damnest, even at the cost of hundreds of thousands of innocent
<br>
lives to replace him with someone you like better?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; opposed that too, tell me if I'm wrong). Here is a man who invaded his neighbors,
</em><br>
<p>With our implicit and nearly explicit consent which we reneged
<br>
on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; slowly tortured and murdered his political opponents, spent billions on chemical
</em><br>
<p>as we also have a habit of doing..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and biological weapons while his subjects live in poverty and children starved,
</em><br>
<p>we also spend billions on &quot;defense&quot; which is not always
<br>
defensive at all and still have far too many of our people in
<br>
jail and far too much poverty and illteracy..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; here is a man  who dropped nerve gas bombs on his own people, a man who
</em><br>
<p>we are a people who have done bio-warfare, radiation and disease
<br>
tests on civilians without their consent.  We also sold him
<br>
(indirectly through Canada) that nerve gas so he could better
<br>
whoop up on the Iranians who we also wanted to keep in line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is frothing at the mouth to obtain nuclear weapons, and how do you advise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with a man like that, what do we do the next time he decides to engage
</em><br>
<p>We already have nukes.  Thousands of them.  And we occassionally
<br>
float the idea of using &quot;tactical&quot; nukes to further our agenda. 
<br>
In a world with superpower[s] greedy for oil who have nukes and
<br>
who are not above using force to get their way and sitting
<br>
beside a nuclear-capable hostile country, I would want nukes or
<br>
something equally deterrent myself if I was the ruler of Iraq. 
<br>
Wouldn't you?
<br>
<p>I advise dealing with him like with any other ruler of a
<br>
sovereign nation we are supposedly not at war with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in murder at the wholesale level? Well, we certainly can't do anything militarily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can't do anything economically either, and considering your well known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horror of insults (directed at anybody but me that is) we can't even give him a
</em><br>
<p>Have I insulted you since all the past brouhaha?  No?  Then why
<br>
bring it up?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; good tongue lashing as we might hurt poor Saddam's feelings, the only method
</em><br>
<p>This is deteriorating in quality rapidly.  Stick to what I
<br>
actually say if you intend to discuss with me.
