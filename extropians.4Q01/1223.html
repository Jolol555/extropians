Don't be silly, J.R. I'm not stating any of those things, and you've
<br>
leaped to conclusions.
<br>
<p>I only point out that libertarians should be able to explain why some
<br>
countries have struggled alot harder than other countries under almost
<br>
identical conditions during and since communism fell, and I don't
<br>
think that libertarians can explain it without the extra pieces of
<br>
information that De Soto's book provides. (my opinion based on my
<br>
conversation with Mark)
<br>
<p>Libertarians should also be able to answer to why, in general, many
<br>
poorer countries that have the communism yoke lifted now aren't taking
<br>
off. A glib answer 'that it took communism 70 years to mess up their
<br>
country' is unsatisfactory. I'm presenting this, slightly playing
<br>
devil's advocate, but more to show that this is a glaring deficiency
<br>
for folks who wish to promote freedom in all its forms. From what I
<br>
know about De Soto's book, we have a powerful new set of concepts now
<br>
that we can use to answer the critics, and to change the situation in
<br>
those countries too.
<br>
<p>[You can be sure that communist-advocates or those against libertarian
<br>
ideas will point to Lithuania's situation and ask why this country
<br>
which had so fewer communists is struggling the most out of the three
<br>
Baltic countries?]
<br>
<p>You must look at the layers underneath, i.e. the old and new economic
<br>
and political infrastructure during communism and after the Fall to
<br>
understand the differences between the rate of economic advancement
<br>
between the three countries. I'm sure that the book will be able to
<br>
point out some good reasons, but since I didn't read the book yet, and
<br>
have a still fuzzy unformed picture of the kinds of nodes and networks
<br>
that are important, I'll stop here.
