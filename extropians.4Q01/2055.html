<em>&gt; Who are you and what have you done with Michael Lorrey?  Immigrants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a low-trust market?  Public assistance for music?  Big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations taking advantage of poor artists?
</em><br>
<p>Immigration, as well as poor civics education in schools, contribute to
<br>
diluting the trust foundations of a high trust society, when those
<br>
immigrants originate from predominantly low-trust societies.
<br>
<p>I did not say 'public assistance' either, I said 'financial aid'. This
<br>
could be instituted on a private basis by distributors and creators of
<br>
IP who want to be proactive about combatting piracy. The software
<br>
business already does this with special low pricing for students and
<br>
educational institutions. By instituting different prices for the same
<br>
product for different markets, you realize wider sales than if you treat
<br>
everyone as the same market, and you reduce the incentive for piracy.
<br>
<p>And, YES, I said 'big corporations taking advantage of poor artists'. It
<br>
is no secret or lie. The fact is that there are a limited number of
<br>
record companies and a limited amount of both retail space in record
<br>
stores and airtime on radios and music TV channels, while the supply of
<br>
artists is overwhelmingly huge. The natural market reaction when supply
<br>
far exceeds demand is that the suppliers are under pressure to either
<br>
leave the market or accept getting screwed by a limited number of buyers
<br>
who are aware of their status and power. When the buyers price in most
<br>
cases is below that one can obtain to remain on welfare, the artists are
<br>
certainly being screwed.
<br>
<p>I am also quite aware of how many businesses use creative accounting
<br>
practices to create the impression that the company is losing money when
<br>
it is actually making it hand over fist. 
<br>
<p>The inventory game, for example, which the record companies are in,
<br>
allows them to produce a CD for $1.00, while stating it's retail value
<br>
is $16.99. If the record company instead sells the CD for an average of
<br>
$15.00, on paper the company took a loss of $1.99 on every CD, when it
<br>
actually profited $14.00.
<br>
<p>In the arena of band tours, the record company will 'sell' the band
<br>
equipment and support people at inflated rates, then 'buy' them back at
<br>
depressed values that the record company itself sets, thus creating the
<br>
impression that the tour cost far more than it actually did, which eats
<br>
into the royalties the company pays to the artists. This is why most
<br>
artists don't make any profit on their work until their third or fourth
<br>
album with the label.
