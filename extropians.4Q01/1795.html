<br>
<p>Brian and James, thanks for your input. Mike, sounds like you're pretty
<br>
well set!
<br>
<p>I didn't mean to imply that the Extropian Fire Drill would have zero
<br>
disruption to people's lives and finances. Just that one of its
<br>
guiding principles should be minimizing this disruption. Nor did I
<br>
mean to imply that the entry costs would be negligible. Just that the
<br>
entry costs should be incremental rather than all-or-none, thus
<br>
reducing the entry barrier.
<br>
<p>There would be multiple levels of preparedness, BUT even the lowest
<br>
level should still be a substantial advantage over not preparing at
<br>
all. Divide the cost estimates by the number of people participating.
<br>
<p>Level 1: at least half a dozen people have agreed upon a suitable
<br>
small town to rent motel rooms (or a barn, or a campground) in; posess
<br>
maps to the location and contact info for each other; bring with them
<br>
whatever equipment, skills, and supplies they already have.
<br>
Cost: $0, a few person-hours research
<br>
<p>Level 2: A representative from the Firedrill Club has visited the town
<br>
and negotiated an agreement with local landowners whereby an unused
<br>
building will be rentable to the group on a few day's
<br>
notice. Representative also cultivates the goodwill of local political
<br>
and economic leaders (city council, library, Rotary Club, chamber of
<br>
commerce). Diplomay is crucial at this point! Do not send somebody who
<br>
will rant about black helicopters, nor about
<br>
nanotech/AI/uploading. This is basically just a private, decentralized
<br>
initiative to preserve high-tech expertise and Democratic/Free-market
<br>
values in order to minimize the duration of any societal collapse that
<br>
may occur. If presented right, few people would disagree with
<br>
it. Maybe distribute copies of an entry-level sci-fi novel on the
<br>
subject, if an appropriate one can be found.
<br>
Cost: $0 - $700, a few person-days of schmoozing and travel-time
<br>
<p>Level 3: Acquire plans and materials for building
<br>
wind-turbines. Acquire deep-cycle batteries and the circuitry
<br>
necessary to interface the generators with the batteries and the power
<br>
grid of a building. Stockpile items either at the homes of the
<br>
club-members or on-site if the owner doesn't mind. Build and test a
<br>
prototype wind-turbine on site, and insure that multiple club members
<br>
know how to do it. Preferrably all of them. Meanwhile, the
<br>
participants round out their individual packing lists-- several day's
<br>
supply of nonperishable food, first aid kits, hand tools, several
<br>
pairs of sturdy shoes, essential books, firearms, ammunition,
<br>
replacement parts for cars and crucial appliances.
<br>
Cost: $6000 - $10,000, a person-year of preparation, including the
<br>
first 'Fire Drill'
<br>
Note: I'm not sure if it's feasible to build solar panels from
<br>
low-tech materials, but if so, substitute in &quot;solar panels and
<br>
wind-turbines&quot;
<br>
<p>Level 4: Acquire the high-end materials and skills. Some members get
<br>
certified as EMTs. Some members take vocational classes in
<br>
auto-repair, appliance-repair, carpentry, welding, etc. Circumstances
<br>
permitting, members serve as part-time/deputy cops, EMTs, or
<br>
firefighters in their own communities to get hands-on experience
<br>
handling critical situations. Several *desktop* computers, printers,
<br>
CD-RW drives, a scanner, a projector, and hubs to wire them all to
<br>
each other are set aside for the effort, along with three sets of
<br>
replacements for each replaceable part. The 'technology tree' needed
<br>
to make these items new will take many years to restore, and they have
<br>
to last until then. If there are members in professions that require
<br>
specialized equpiment (musicians, scientists, visual artists) they
<br>
should likewise stock up on parts and materials that would require a
<br>
large technological infrastructure to produce. This is also where the
<br>
members burn every piece of text, data, graphics, sound, and software
<br>
they can get their hands on onto CDs, preferrably multiple
<br>
copies. Hold several more 'Fire Drills'
<br>
Cost: $10,000 - $100,000, several person-years
<br>
<p>Level 5: Given that more than two years have passed by now, and many
<br>
thousands have been invested, one can be assured that the participants
<br>
are thoroughly committed to the project, and more have probably joined
<br>
once it is clear that this Firedrill Club is here to stay. This may be
<br>
a good time to consider purchasing land and building a permanent
<br>
structure on it. Some cross between a warehouse, a fortress, and a
<br>
very small university. Firedrills are by now a yearly celebration. The
<br>
group incorporates as a charity or a for-profit corporation, and
<br>
commences formal PR, fundraising, and recruitment efforts. The group
<br>
is a member of a loose consortium of similar groups around the world,
<br>
with which it will attempt to reestablish communication and coordinate
<br>
efforts should disaster strike. Exclaves can specialize in
<br>
technologically more ambitious ventures-- chip fabs, molecular biology
<br>
labs, launch platforms, factories.
<br>
Cost: $100,000+
<br>
<p>The above is just a crude sketch of a plan. Obviously different groups
<br>
would find themselves with different opportunities and liabilities. A
<br>
more thorough plan would be something like the research trees familiar
<br>
to strategy gamers- a hierarchy of needed items interconnected by
<br>
dependencies.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
