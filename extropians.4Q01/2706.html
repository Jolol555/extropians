</em><br>
<p>Probably around the same way that Myers-Briggs and the Enneagram look to
<br>
me:  Darned silly.  Which is the point I was trying to make with all
<br>
this.  Any system of phrenology works about equally well, whether it's
<br>
Myers-Briggs, the Enneagram, the AD&amp;D alignment wheel, or White Wolf's
<br>
Nature/Demeanor system.
<br>
<p>Actually, I consider the gaming systems to be superior, since they were
<br>
created by highly creative people, with a sense of humor, who had
<br>
customers to satisfy; this in contrast to ivory towerfolk who take
<br>
themselves far too seriously.  I'd rather know whether someone is lawful
<br>
or chaotic than introverted or extroverted, and the Natures and Demeanors
<br>
strike me as being more specific (they more clearly fit or not fit a given
<br>
facet of a given personality) than the Enneagram types.  When creative,
<br>
smart people try to have fun, useful ideas can come out of it; but Ifni
<br>
preserve me from social scientists.
<br>
<p>So I think it would be fun to relentlessly mock the Myers-Briggs and
<br>
Enneagram systems by posting followup messages that use the alignment
<br>
wheel or Nature/Demeanor instead.  I am willing to show that I can conduct
<br>
a conversation that makes just as much apparent sense as Myers-Briggs
<br>
using the alignment wheel.  More sense than Myers-Briggs, in fact.  You'd
<br>
have a much harder time arguing that I'm chaotic evil than that I'm ENFP
<br>
or whatever.
<br>
<p>We'll see how long I can keep it up before I get bored.
