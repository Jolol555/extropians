Subliminal learning works, says study
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1618000/1618192.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1618000/1618192.stm</a>
<br>
<p>But it will not mean the end of classrooms
<br>
Some tasks can be learned without even paying attention, a new study says.
<br>
A team of scientists led by Takeo Watanabe of Boston University, US, got
<br>
volunteers to concentrate on one task while surreptitiously training them for
<br>
another.
<br>
<p>They performed better than untrained colleagues despite not being aware of the
<br>
training.
<br>
<p>The team writes in the journal Nature that its findings have important
<br>
implications for understanding how the brain adjusts to the environment.
<br>
<p>Detecting the dots
<br>
The researchers got the volunteers to name letters appearing on a screen.
<br>
<p>While they were working, a series of dots were moving, apparently randomly,
<br>
around the screen.
<br>
<p>In actual fact, one in 20 of them were moving in a particular direction.
<br>
<p>When asked later to detect similar dots moving in the same direction, the
<br>
volunteers performed better than counterparts who had not had the subliminal
<br>
exposure.
<br>
<p>Flexible brains
<br>
The findings do not spell the end for paying attention in class:
<br>
<p>&quot;Although the present finding does not deny the important role of attention in
<br>
perceptual learning and in motion, it indicates that the adult brain has the
<br>
flexibility to adapt to certain features of the environment as a result of
<br>
mere exposure,&quot; the team writes.
<br>
<p>The scientists speculate that subliminal learning may have helped evolving
<br>
humans pick up on features of their environment more efficiently.

<p>Subliminal sights educate brain
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/011025/011025-12.html">http://www.nature.com/nsu/011025/011025-12.html</a>
Paying attention isn't the only way to learn.
<p>Today's busy world could overwhealm our ever-learning brains.
You must pay attention to learn, teachers say. Not necessarily, US
psychologists now argue: sights we are unaware of can have a lasting impact on
our brains.
<p>Subliminal training can improve our ability to see moving dots, Takeo Watanabe
and his co-workers at Boston University, Massachusetts, have found. &quot;Without
noticing, we are unconsciously learning,&quot; Watanabe says. Repeated exposure to
objects we are oblivious to &quot;could have a tremendous effect on our brains&quot;, he
says.
<p>The findings show that for basic visual processes &quot;the brain is never
resting&quot;, says Robert Stickgold, who studies consciousness at Harvard
University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<p>Psychologists must now ask whether we can learn more complex tasks without
paying attention, says Stickgold. Although for students looking to skip school
he cautions that &quot;No one's going to learn a foreign language without going to
lessons.&quot;
<p>Live and learn
We are learning automatically as we walk around, explains Ken Nakayama, who
studies vision at Harvard. &quot;Patterns pass us all the time,&quot; he says, like cars
and people on the street. Subconscious learning may be an efficient way to
absorb these sideline features without trying. &quot;You can't pay attention to
everything,&quot; he says.
<p>&quot;The less the world we're living in is like the one we evolved in, the more
the mechanism is inappropriate&quot;
--Robert Stickgold, Harvard University
<p>Such a learning strategy may have evolved to help us incorporate recurrent,
and therefore important, information about our environment into our memory,
thinks Watanabe. Animal movements are a good example.
<p>The results also suggest we cannot screen out irrelevant, unwanted
information. This is worrying, given that today we are bombarded with moving
images from TVs, neon signs and even mobile phone displays. &quot;The less the
world we're living in is like the one we evolved in, the more the mechanism is
inappropriate,&quot; says Stickgold.
<p>Join the dots
Watanabe's team asked subjects to look at letters on a screen. Surrounding the
letters were dots moving randomly, like the background fuzz after TV
programmes have ended for the night. The participants did not realise that 5%
of the dots were moving consistently in one direction.
<p>After 25 days of subliminal training, people were tested on their ability to
see a detectable level (10%) of dots moving in one direction. They were 20%
better than normal at seeing the movement orientation they had previously been
exposed to1.
<p>Certain features of an object, such as movement or colour, make nerve cells in
the brain fire. Subliminal training may fine-tune these cells, making them
especially sensitive to a particular direction of motion, the team thinks.
