<p>Let's see, according to you there is proof America wanted Iraq to invade
<br>
Kuwait, there is proof America deliberately helped Saddam Hussein make
<br>
nerve gas, but there is no proof Bin Laden had anything to do with 911 and
<br>
there is no proof the Taliban protected bin laden. Well, I could be wrong
<br>
but a word exists that I think pretty well describes that particular variety of
<br>
thought processing, however list rules forbid me from saying what it is.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;even then it would be unjust to claim that every member of a group,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; some of whom, allegedly abetted such an action, are all guilty
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; of doing so.
</em><br>
<p>if America has really done wrong in this war then logically the best way
<br>
to make up for past sins would be to put the Taliban back into power and
<br>
make women put a bag back on their head. The logic of your argument
<br>
would seem to demand such a policy. Is that your current position and if
<br>
not why not? I do not of course expect to get a straight answer to this
<br>
question from you.
