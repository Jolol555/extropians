<p>I'm not sure I follow the above reasoning. The only one discussing &quot;banning&quot; mockery is you. 
<br>
<p>Calling mockery tired, or tiresome, or banal, or anything else, and asking that someone do something more constructive,
<br>
doesn't constitute &quot;banning&quot; as far as I can see.
<br>
<p>The rest of your comments were inappropriately tagged as being E. Shaun's, though his were at the bottom and
<br>
double-&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;'d. Please consider more careful proofreading of your posts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Free markets are the most successful approach to economic and social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization that we have developed so far. But that should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent us from thinking of possibly even better alternatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember &quot;Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite&quot;. It is clear that L and E are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orthogonal concepts. I believe that F is the only glue that can hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them together. So when I think of those who are damaged by free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets (please don't say that nobody is), I cannot help hoping that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we develop an approach to economic and social organization that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retains most of the benefits of free markets, while at the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protecting the interests of those who are currently unable to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full advantage of them.
</em><br>
<p>OK, and this hope for more F is helped precisely _how_ by sarcasm? Is sarcasm &quot;analysis&quot;?
<br>
<p>&quot;Critical thinking&quot;, the way most people seem to practice it, is pretty cheap. I include myself, all too often.
