</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; For example, the 'standard' wavelet transforms which determine

<p><em>&gt;Just out of curiosity, why couldn't full spectral re-synthesis be

</em><br>
<p>I don't know the answer, but I'll venture some guesses, assuming
<br>
that by &quot;spectral&quot; you mean Fourier decomposition and
<br>
recomposition methods. Gaps in the data would produce fictitious
<br>
peaks at low frequencies, where the wavelengths are comparable to
<br>
the gaps. Also, I think that you have to be careful, when using
<br>
Fourier methods, that the data is stationary, and my own experience
<br>
in scientific time series is that stationarity occurs rarely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to shy away from statistical models because many, though not all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statistical models seem to be sensitive to anomalies in the data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i.e. even many of the adaptive ones are based on the &quot;expected case&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and can do ugly things when they come across something unusual.
</em><br>
<p>I think that there is a trend to use wavelets and beyond for those
<br>
time-series that have anomalies. By &quot;beyond&quot; I mean multiple
<br>
wavelets, wavelet packets, cosine packets, chirplets, warplets.
<br>
Mallat, in _A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing_ says that creating
<br>
new basis families may become just a popular new sport of basis
<br>
hunting if not motivated by application.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unrelated to this discussion, it kind of shocks me to see some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the archaic methods of analyzing and working with time series data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used in many parts of industry and even science and engineering. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engineering discipline of signal processing has very mature and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremely generalized mathematics for handling just about any aspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of generic time series data you could want in many cases, but many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the algorithms are rarely applied outside of that discipline.
</em><br>
<p>OK you're shocked, but the reality is that scientists don't have
<br>
enough hours in the day to be up-to-speed on the latest techniques.
<br>
<p>In the astronomy that I know about, helioseismologists are the most
<br>
aware about digital signal processing because the Sun acts like
<br>
a ringing gas bell providing one million oscillation modes that
<br>
need to be sorted out. The seismic geophysicists know a bit more
<br>
because the Earth's interior presents a sticky inhomogeneous challenge
<br>
to find the oscillations. Helioseismolgists frequently go to
<br>
geophysics meetings to be exposed to the sophisticated techniques
<br>
that the other field uses. The digital signal processing people
<br>
have the most sophisticated techniques, but then you have to allocate
<br>
alot of time to discover them.  How to do that?
<br>
<p>Scientists could choose to go to large meetings where only 1% of
<br>
people in their field are present, in order to be exposed to more
<br>
fields and problem-solving methods, but then they risk that it might
<br>
be a lot of money and precious time spent on the possibility that
<br>
they will not get their hands on that special method that will solve
<br>
their scientific problem better. Or they could choose to spend their
<br>
precious time and money only on the science meetings where they will
<br>
have the maximum interacton with people in their own field. My
<br>
meeting-attendence pattern during the last few years was more like
<br>
the latter. I only encountered the paper above because I scheduled
<br>
part of my holiday last month to spend with a group of volcanologists.
<br>
<p>The following link points to some of the mathematical methods
<br>
on which a scientist should be up-to-speed (in my opinion),
<br>
and I think it's an impossible task, given their time constraints:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amara.com/science/science.html#num">http://www.amara.com/science/science.html#num</a>
<br>
<p>Here's a money-making hint. Scientists need the help of scientific
<br>
programmers and numerical-methods specialists who are knowledgeable
<br>
about the latest and best numerical methods. (I would dearly love to
<br>
hire AmaraGrapsv.1991, because she was much more aware of these
<br>
methods than AmaraGrapsv.2001, and I hear her rates were cheap.) If
<br>
you can find a way to fill this need given the paperwork and
<br>
bureaucratic nonsense and garbage when dealing with
<br>
government-funded science, please try. Ten years ago I wrote a
<br>
proposal for setting up a &quot;Scientific Computing Center&quot; at NASA-Ames
<br>
to exactly do this, and it wasn't funded. Maybe I didn't present it
<br>
right, or the time wasn't right, but the need still exists.
