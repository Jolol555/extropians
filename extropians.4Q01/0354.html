<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the forth update on my food satiation experiments, in which I
<br>
compare the ad libitum calorie intake of various foods over a period of
<br>
one day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ate turkey/mustard sandwiches, using the same rye bread, which
<br>
tested out by itself to yield a daily intake of 1388 calories. These
<br>
sandwiches fell into the medium palatibility group. Possibly due to this
<br>
increased palatibility, intake jumped significantly to 2371 calories.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I tried rice cakes, also with turkey and mustard on them.
<br>
Although this tasted okay, the texture of the rice cakes resembled
<br>
styrofoam, and because of this this palatability was low. Intake was 1602
<br>
calories, which is similar to other low palatability foods.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I tried angel food cake, with raspberry jam on top. I selected
<br>
this as a food with high air, and low calorie content per volume. This
<br>
turned out to very palatable. However the cake proved to be very
<br>
compressible during mastigation, and although the quantity looked like a
<br>
lot on a plate, it proved not to be very filling. Intake was 2936
<br>
calories. At least this is still 1000 calories less than cookies.
