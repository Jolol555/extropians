Success of unmanned aircraft revives interest in technology
<br>
<p>Dec. 14 - Coming to a military theater near you: the &quot;robo lobster.&quot; If Navy
<br>
planners have their way, the eight-legged underwater robot, loaded with
<br>
sensors that can see and even smell, will be used starting about 2010 to find
<br>
landmines buried along potentially dangerous coasts. Also on deck is a sister
<br>
system, dubbed the robo crab, an electronic crustacean that will climb up on
<br>
the beach and beam back images of what soldiers would encounter when they
<br>
venture onshore.
<br>
<p>On dry land, the Army is making strides with vehicles that could provide
<br>
surveillance or supply troops with ammunition. Some could even put up a smoke
<br>
screen and throw a net over the approaching enemy. Military planners see such
<br>
vehicles, which vary in size from slightly smaller than a Volkswagen Beetle to
<br>
as big as a tank, as a critical part of efforts to transform the Army into a
<br>
fleet-footed force that can quickly be deployed to a battle zone. Criticized
<br>
for reliance on heavy tanks and artillery, Army officials are working toward
<br>
what they call a &quot;Future Combat System,&quot; in which lighter, less-armored
<br>
vehicles will be employed.
