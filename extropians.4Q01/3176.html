Sounds great!
<br>
<p>Isn't there a risk of chromosome damage proportional to the amount of
<br>
rough handling the cells undergo? If so, this process is mainly going to
<br>
benefit women since the amount of damage to sperm cells is likely
<br>
higher.

<p>And this also have the truly annoying effect of making people ask

dangerous questions about virgin births and so on. No doubt that is

going to cause reactions among certain christians.
<br>
<p>People like Kass have a ready answer to all this: it doesn't matter what
<br>
the exact definition of human is, since all these technologies are
<br>
wrong. Why are they wrong? Because they fill Kass and his friends with
<br>
revulsion, and such a deep moral intuition can't be wrong, can it? Of
<br>
course, then Kass try to explain additional reasons (rationalizations)
<br>
why certain things shouldn't be done. I think his chief argument here is
<br>
that we see a commodization of life, and that leads to us undervaluing
<br>
the value of real human lives. It is interesting to ask if this kind of
<br>
slippery slope can't have the opposite effect: since humans can be
<br>
derived from nearly any kinds of cells (more or less), the important
<br>
things about being human does not hinge on cells. But Kass and many
<br>
other bioconservatives seem to hold a strangely genetically
<br>
deterministic view of the human being.
