</em><br>
<em>&gt;way of thinking has to arise to explain this clearly.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If you wait for someone to develop the perfect terminology you will have
<br>
to wait forever. Instead use state-of-the-art ethical and political
<br>
terminology in the constitution, and be aware that it might need future
<br>
updating (and that this updating may be troublesome).  As for the flaws
<br>
of rights, do you really have any alternative? Right now there doesn't
<br>
seem to exist any better terminology than rights, so that is likely what
<br>
people would use. 
<br>
<p>Note that we have talked about rights very loosely here - it is a big
<br>
subject in philosophy, and there exist a huge range of rights, forms of
<br>
rights, motivations for rights and things to base rights from. Are you
<br>
saying all these approaches are futile, or are you doubtful about
<br>
certain commonly used rights concepts? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As such, the treaty should not aim to cover all bases with &quot;rights&quot; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more with some sensible systems-based rules that also happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discourage the problems associated with lack of &quot;rights&quot;. For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the core rule that others can leave freely will prevent supression of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom (as most people define it).
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What if the community claims you owe them a certain amount of money? I
<br>
can imagine a constitution saying you cannot leave unless you pay off
<br>
your debts, which means communities could hold people inside simply by
<br>
forcing an administrative fee on them. Or the constitution could say you
<br>
are free to leave - which means you could sneak away from debts. Neither
<br>
situation is particularly desirable. With a rule based system you cannot
<br>
avoid this kind of problems, because the rules do not generalize like
<br>
statements of rights. With a rights system you can add a generalization
<br>
layer to the rules: people have the right to leave, with a rule telling
<br>
certain conditions on this like having to settle debts but also with a
<br>
clause telling that this rule only applies for reasonable situations -
<br>
i.e. the &quot;administrative fee&quot; could be judged against the right. This is
<br>
hard to do with a strictly pure rule based system since that doesn't
<br>
contain any information about the meaning of the rules and what values
<br>
they are intended to uphold - try defining &quot;unreasonable&quot; only using
<br>
rules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt; There isn't any need to try this across the entire world at once, but it can be started on a relatively small scale and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop (both by more communities/nations joining, and possibly by the creation of smaller sub-communities if it appears promising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locally). &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think the current world situation does not seem encouraging in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect because many nations and people still feel unprepared for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For instance, one sometimes hears jokes on the political apathy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singapore, and it seems like Singaporeans do not have enough maturity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to accept a full-fledged democracy (though many might disagree). Nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also seem very much attached to their histories and current ways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life (read Israel vs. Palestine, China vs. Taiwan, India vs. Pakistan).
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So? The fact that a lot of people doesn't get it doesn't mean it is not
<br>
a practical idea. The Internet developed wonderfully long before it was
<br>
known to many people, and in fact it was likely this long try-out period
<br>
that made it so resilient and robust once a lot of people began to flock
<br>
to it. If 99% of humanity views the federation(s) with apathy or scorn,
<br>
so what? That gives plenty of time to iron out the bugs and see if the
<br>
system really is worth anything. It also gives time to people to come up
<br>
with new ways of seeing things and ways of presenting the new ideas to
<br>
others. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I suspect that a great shock must occur to underline very clearly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems of the current international political systems before even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minority of the nations will consider this. Even so, if the largest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most powerful nations (who would lose the most with this great shift in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;global political power) influenced the UN to outlaw or seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deminish the power of the Federation (such as by not allowing dual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;membership), this can cause a great set-back.
</em><br>
<p>I think this kind of &quot;political catastrophism&quot; is wrong. First, great
<br>
changes can occur gradually (just look at the move towards free markets
<br>
and democracy in Chile, for example - no Berlin walls falling there - or
<br>
the emergence of the EU) and do not require huge concerted movements of
<br>
many nations. A small test here, another there, positive results
<br>
stimulating another nation to informally change its regional policy, a
<br>
second nation taking up the idea to defuse an ethnic problem, and so on
<br>
- that can make the federative idea real.
<br>
<p>I have repeatedly seen people here on this list falling into the trap of
<br>
thinking that the stuff we are discussing here is so revolutionary, so
<br>
transformative that it has to get into direct conflicts with The Powers
<br>
That Be. It is a very conventient way of thinking, since it both
<br>
produces exciting scenarios (Hollywood memes), boosts the illusion of
<br>
importance of the ideas and promotes inaction (so you can never be
<br>
proven wrong). Just look at how the numerous threads about artificial
<br>
island nations always end. But frankly, the federation idea is hardly
<br>
revolutionary and would be a trivial blip on the world political scene
<br>
compared to current and near future issues like terrorism, the rise of
<br>
China and India, the federative changes in Europe, globalization and
<br>
everything else. Things may change if the federation starts to become
<br>
significant, but remember that significant changes never happen unless
<br>
there are powerful forces *promoting* them - be they economic, political
<br>
expediency, technological momentum, massive popular support or - most
<br>
importantly - that many believe in the idea.
