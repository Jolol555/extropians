<p>Its not over until its over -- and it is unlikely to be
<br>
over for a very long time, *if*, as I have pointed out,
<br>
the events of the last several months are the tip of the
<br>
iceberg that is the resistance of &quot;fundamentalists&quot;
<br>
against the onslaught of the singularity.
<br>
<p>The best we may be able to hope for is minimal casualties
<br>
on both sides.  In that respect the news of the last couple
<br>
of days has been heartening since we can get on with the
<br>
business of feeding people rather than bombing or shooting
<br>
them.
