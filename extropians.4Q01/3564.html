<p>Actually, I fear this is not true. While there is a lot of money being
<br>
invested in activities we like, this investment is not driven by the
<br>
values we have. If we ran things, we would not back down from a
<br>
promising technology just because it was disliked - but the NIH and
<br>
companies you mentiones are not motivated by ideology in what they are
<br>
doing, rather by profit (monetary or not) and would if the public
<br>
opinion made a direction of research unprofitable simply bend. Sure, a
<br>
certain amount of self-serving lobbying would take place, but it would
<br>
not be motivated by fairly short-range motive.
<br>
<p>Also, I think we still have not put our core agenda in good shape. The
<br>
transhumanist worldview is far less rich, complex and with connections
<br>
to current issues than the anti-enlightenment views we are struggling
<br>
with: compare the few paltry pages and texts we have with the massive
<br>
environmental literature and its accompanying vision of a certain
<br>
natural order, shored up by ties both to romanticism, the left and many
<br>
consumer interests! It is not just a case that they have been doing it
<br>
longer, the core worldview is rather consistent and easy to adapt to new
<br>
situations - given a situation, any situation at all, and you can put it
<br>
into the great narrative of environmentalism. It is far harder to do
<br>
what with transhumanism, which makes it harder to make transhumanism an
<br>
integral part of other debates. 
<br>
<p>We have so far been helped by the existence of pro-tech and pro-progress
<br>
ideologies and institutions with compatible goals. But these ideologies
<br>
and institutions need all the help they can get right now, and if we
<br>
want to be able to actually drive developments beyond those currently
<br>
seen as rational we will need to make these alliances and create a
<br>
worldview that can be just as visionary, ambitious and action-provoking
<br>
as the environmentalist, socialist or religious worldviews. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I mentioned to Greg yesterday, a ban on cloning actually *helps*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my current business strategy (a ban on the use of &quot;natural&quot; stem-cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloned from an individual would promote the use of &quot;synthetic&quot; stem-cells).
</em><br>
<p>The problem is of course that the opponents would not just pack up and
<br>
go home, they would simply move to the next target. In this case I guess
<br>
it would be genetic engineering and reproductory medicine.
