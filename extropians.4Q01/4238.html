</em><br>
<p>Wind energy is the most mature renewables technology outside of
<br>
hydropower. It's only real downside is the reliance on the winds.
<br>
Current market rates for wind power run from 4.5-5.5 cents/kwh for large
<br>
wind farms, but this past year's energy crisis in California is partly
<br>
the result of lower than expected winds.
<br>
<p>Solar power currently costs 25-50 cents/kwh, although the new solar
<br>
shingles technology, as it matures and expands in roofing market share,
<br>
could lower this to as little as 12 cents/kwh. For markets where
<br>
homeowners are already paying 12-15 cents/kwh (Hawaii, New York City,
<br>
New England, etc).
<br>
<p>Tidal power, despite decades of technology development (centuries,
<br>
actually) has run into a brick wall of environmentalist opposition.
<br>
Tidal storage pools frequently become stagnant havens for malaria and
<br>
other diseases, and the change in immersion behavior adversely affects
<br>
local wildlife. The technology is shifting, though, from use of storage
<br>
basins to simply stationing free floating turbines in tidal and other
<br>
ocean currents, rotating at slow enough speeds to not endanger wildlife.
<br>
<p>Wave power is also similarly mature, with installations in Norway,
<br>
Denmark, Java, and other locales with significant reliable wave
<br>
activity. There are numerous designs that have been used, the most
<br>
reliable seeming to be the use of a large closed air cylinder with a
<br>
wind turbine at the top, where the waves change the bottom surface level
<br>
to power the turbine with changes in pressure. Costs can range from 3-10
<br>
cents / kwh.
<br>
<p>OTEC: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion technology is well developed, with
<br>
several pilot projects running around the world, on various islands, and
<br>
the technology has the added benefit of being useful for creating large
<br>
quantities of fresh water inexpensively. Maintenance of OTEC plants is a
<br>
bit higher than expected, though, which obviously affects cost and
<br>
reliability, but is still quite a useful market competetive technology.
<br>
OTEC is most useful in tropical locales where there is a significant
<br>
thermocline between the surface and deeps, and there must be a
<br>
relatively short distance from the platform to deep water. A floating
<br>
platform would be best, but is not as secure and inexpensive as basing
<br>
the plant on shore.
<br>
<p>OTEC is the best technology to use for those seeking to build
<br>
micronations on various islands, it is essentially an indirect method of
<br>
utilizing passive solar heating of surface water. OTEC efficiency can be
<br>
boosted by the construction of large shallow warming pools to preheat
<br>
surface water to higher than normal temperatures. This is also useful
<br>
for expanding the latitudinal range of usefulness of this technology.
<br>
<p>Passive Solar Power: Utilizing the heating abilities of solar power
<br>
allows one to gain far higher efficiencies than afforded by
<br>
photovoltaics or photochemical methods. Passive solar systems run
<br>
between 50-90% efficient and can frequently be constructed with no
<br>
moving parts when used only for heating needs. Heated fluids can, of
<br>
course, be used to generate electricity, but most such systems built on
<br>
a large scale to date have been excessively complex, which adds to their
<br>
operating costs in maintenance. Such systems use rather large numbers of
<br>
mirrors which independently follow the sun through its course, rather
<br>
than using one large bowl shaped mirror (like the Aricebo
<br>
radiotelescope) with one moving thermal receiver.
<br>
<p>Biofuels: The use of agricultural produce to create fuels like methanol
<br>
is well developed, but is still quite expensive and is generally used in
<br>
the US and Europe as a welfare program for farmers, which artificially
<br>
inflates fossil fuel costs, than as a realistic energy alternative.
