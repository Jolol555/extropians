<em>&gt;&gt;Your argument above makes sense, but I was told about  two wrongs not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;making a right a long time ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose a million American casualties in a invasion of Japan would be
</em><br>
viewed as a
<br>
<em>&gt; wrong too by Americans, a wrong they wanted to avoid. We'll never know if
</em><br>
the numbers
<br>
<em>&gt; really would have been that high but it's not unreasonable for the leaders
</em><br>
of that time to
<br>
<em>&gt; think they would be, certainly many thousands of soldiers thought the
</em><br>
nuclear bomb had
<br>
<em>&gt; saved their life.
</em><br>
<p>False alternative!  You are narrowing the options down to bomb or invade.
<br>
If the US had sought _conditional surrender_, an invasion and subsequent
<br>
might not have been necessary.  In fact, the Japanese were already making
<br>
peace feelers to the Soviets in 1945 before atomic weapons were used.
<br>
<p>Even this third alternative is not the only one, but I find it much more
<br>
moral and better than what happened.  It is only the modern, collectivist
<br>
view of war as between whole nations that makes most people think of every
<br>
war as needing to be a total war -- one of society vs. society where all the
<br>
resources and manpower of each society is mobilized, used, and targeted.  If
<br>
we remove that grid, wars can once again become limited affairs -- army vs.
<br>
army or, better, leader vs. leader rather than all against all.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
