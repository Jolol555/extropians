</em><br>
<p>Your dialogue has been completely unpersuasive. We are most
<br>
certainly engaged in seeking out and destroying those responsible
<br>
for 9/11, while at the same time taking considerable pains to
<br>
minimize civilian casualties.
<br>
<p>The human rights disaster took place on 9/11 and the one you are
<br>
trying to foretell will not occur.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I don't know if it does or did come mainly from the US or not. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But I know it is not happending now and hasn't been since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mid-September when the truck convoys were stopped.  What was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left has all but dried up due to the bombing.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Actually it is the actions of the Taliban which have played a large
<br>
part in curtailing the food shipments. This has been widely
<br>
reported in the International press.
<br>
<p>As soon as we can provide some stability, these shipments will
<br>
resume.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We should not stop if 3-4 million people will die of starvation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if we don't restart the food transport and distributing very

</em><br>
<em>&gt;callousness is justified?
</em><br>
<p>As I've already pointed out despite your dire warnings to the
<br>
contrary such a disaster will not occur.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Keeping 3-4 million civilians from starving this winder is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;placating terrorists&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>Clearly if such a thing was to occur (it won't) it would be
<br>
disastrous for U.S. policy. It will not be allowed to occur.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I am concerned with their correct perception of the atrocious

</em><br>

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;I&quot; have not committed any atrocities so I'm not sure of the &quot;we&quot;
<br>
you are speaking about. Agencies of the U.S. government has clearly
<br>
been involved in things they should not have been.
<br>
<p>I notice you continue to ignore the atrocity committed against us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The world does not revovle around the US.  It is about time we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;learned that.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Nor does it revolve around any other country with perhaps the
<br>
exception of Antarctica.
<br>
<p>What's your point?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does that somehow make more measures OK?  
</em><br>
<p>Again you wish to ignore what has already occurred under previous
<br>
administrations you support.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Anybody who wants to be next to die is welcome to try.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I see.  Anyone who is upset enough to attack, even if they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good reason to be upset, will be destroyed and their country
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laid waste possibly including a lot of their civilians.  So we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't need to examine our policies and change those are wrong. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;After all we are the baddest muther on the block.  Excuse me if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that sickens me.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They do not have good reasons, and yes to keep it simple, anyone
<br>
who attacks us is going to get a visit from the U.S. military.
<br>
<p>What happened on 9/11 sickens me.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I am completely confident in our ability to both punish the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; attackers and help the people of Afghanistan.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;On what basis are you confident?  We  have made no plans or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;promises to avoid the impending famine.  
</em><br>
<p>As a former member of the military and someone who keeps up on such
<br>
things I am intimately aware of our real abilities.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, we do know who did the attack and we do know who they work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Then prove it.  Oh, I forgot, of course you can't prove it which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only proves that a smart deranged fellow like bin Laden must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guilty.
</em><br>
<p>As I've pointed out before, we know the people involved, we know
<br>
who their associates are, we know where they've been, we know where
<br>
the money came from and who controls it.
<br>
<p>Bin Laden.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Well, we have ignored know incidents of these kinds for the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;40+ years or given those involved a slap on the wrist.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glad you would like to see justice there.  
</em><br>
<p>I want to see justice everywhere.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Actually we did not OK these actions or present evidence.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claimed we did not need too.  We claimed we did not need to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Taliban our evidence when we &quot;requested&quot; the extradition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bin Laden.  We have basically told the world they are &quot;either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with US or with the terrorists&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>As I pointed out international law recognizes that a country that
<br>
has been attacked has the right to retaliate.
<br>
<p>The Taliban are not the recognized government of Afghanistan.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If you think their is no righetous anger fueling terrorists acts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against the US then you are ill-informed, dishonest or both.
</em><br>
<p>I am not ill-informed, nor dishonest.
<br>
<p>Try presenting evidence here as to what &quot;we&quot; have done wrong.
<br>
<p>Limit it to the Taliban, and Ossama Bin Laden.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Criminals are not empowered to commit an &quot;act of war&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Criminals should be hauled before a suitable court and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convicted, suitably punished.  We should not collaterally cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the deaths of 3-4 million in the process of bringing them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justice.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
These people are not criminals, but terrorists. There is no
<br>
suitable court, and when we tried hauling the last bunch before a
<br>
court it had absolutely no effect. 5000 people died horrible deaths
<br>
because of this stupid liberal idea.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The price is too high.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They should have thought of that before murdering our people.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I hope for the sake of most of the world that you will not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that much to say about it as the US is currently threatening to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;run amok wherever it things anyone that might be interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threatening it is to be found.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you know enough about me to make this claim. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The U.S. has not threatened to run amok, but it has made it clear
<br>
it will continue to pursue terrorists worldwide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, you would rather have 4 million dead and the region even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more inflamed than it was to produce the Sept 11 atrocity?  Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this make sense to you?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There will be no 4 million dead, and the people of Afghanistan will
<br>
be better off than before we started.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Muslim countries have always fought through Ramadan and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;should  we.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We are not Muslim.  In my opinion it is an insult added to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;huge potential human rights injury that will not be forgotten or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forgiven for a long time.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Your right most of the U.S. is not Muslim. Muslim states have
<br>
always fought during Ramadan and they attacked Israel on it's
<br>
holiest day.
<br>
<p>So in other words there is no precedent to honor such a time and
<br>
there is a precedent to ignore it.
<br>
<p>The only people who want us to stop during Ramadan don't want us
<br>
bombing at all, and are looking for any excuse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As to our next step. How do you think there can ever be peace in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the middle east as long as groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; who's  sole reason of existence is to destroy Israel, are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; permitted to exist?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That is a canard.  The Hezbollah came into power when it turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  At least give some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;balance and acknowldge that the Palestinians have cause for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unrest and that in all justice there should be a real (versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the planned toy) Palestinian state and that Israel has acted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quite badly and even employed more than a little terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself over the last 35 years.
</em><br>
<p><p>I noticed you chose the easiest one to defend, and conveniently
<br>
ignored the rest.
<br>
<p>What about Hamas? Islamic Jihad? The (DFLP) democratic front for
<br>
the liberation of Palestine? All of these groups enjoy
<br>
support/refuge from neighboring Arab states, and all will have to
<br>
be eliminated in order for there to be peace in the middle east.
<br>
<p>The president of Palestine is a terrorist. Terrorism must end for
<br>
there to be peace.
