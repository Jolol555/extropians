<p>How do you normally tell you are in love?  Excited to be around someone, you
<br>
'miss' them when they are not around.  You think about them a lot.  Being
<br>
excited is a measurable emotional state (e.g. heart rate increase, blood
<br>
pressure increase, various hormones present in particular levels)  A feeling
<br>
of loss can be measured when they are not around similarly, memory itself is
<br>
rooted in nueral connections and molecular triggers.  All of these things
<br>
are based on the interactions of matter, nothing is magical.  If matter is
<br>
interacting, it can be measured.  How well and accurately we can measure
<br>
these things is what is continually progressing in science.  If love were
<br>
not rooted in some physical mechanism in the brain then it would not be
<br>
explainable or measurable by science.  However, it is rooted in physical
<br>
mechanisms, just as the other poster said, and once passive atomic scale
<br>
scanning is viable the statistical correlations can be accumulated we could
<br>
determine if someone was in love or not (or thinking about someone they
<br>
love) by viewing the scan.  
<br>
<p>Just because love does not have a supernatural component to it, does not
<br>
mean it is less valuable or wonderfull or amazing to be in love.
