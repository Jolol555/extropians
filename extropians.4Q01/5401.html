Kai:
<br>
<p>I am seriously interested in a dialog with you about this, but focusing on 
<br>
your stated concerns, rather than any threadbare chest-pounding pseudo-debate.
<br>
I'm not on Extropian-freedom, or whatever the list is called. I want to take this
<br>
as a question about appropriate technology and what people need and don't need.
<br>
I want to do this in the spirit of raising the level of debate even about something
<br>
that is FAQ material, because it does concern a crucial point of transhumanity.
<br>
<p>If it ever seems that I am lecturing you or not listening, say so and I will
<br>
back off. I want to take this in as methodical and detailed a fashion as I can. 
<br>
I hope we can both gain from the exchange.
<br>
<p>I have asked five questions. Please look for them marked out with &quot;***&quot;s. 
<br>
Q5 is the crucial one.
<br>
<p>PART 1: SOME THINGS THAT SCARE MICHAEL M. BUTLER
<br>
<p>Kai, I agree that scary people are scary. Tanked-up Hell's Angels on amphetamines
<br>
bumping into me at a bar are really scary, and I don't like the idea of seeing 
<br>
even one of them with a gun in his (or her) hand. 
<br>
<p>So we have a baseline of agreement, yes? People (you and I, at least)
<br>
prefer feeling safer to feeling less safe. Onward!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just to clarify this: My fears are that people go nuts. And people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guns can do more bad things than people without. (Okay, repeat the argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the canister with gasoline, but we currently need gasoline to fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our cars. We don't really need guns in our every day live).
</em><br>
<p>My point about the homicidal man who went back to the club with a dollar's worth of
<br>
gasoline is: gee, if he'd had a gun handy he might have shot his girlfriend,
<br>
and maybe himself and a few other people, instead of burning down a building
<br>
and killing 87. 
<br>
<p>Let's do the math. Even if he were the only one with a gun,
<br>
it probably would have saved lives. Pretty weird, no? If every death is
<br>
a bad thing, he did more bad things without a gun than he would have with
<br>
any gun he would have been likely to get in the same amount of time.
<br>
Even a full auto M-16 with two 30 round magazines.
<br>
<p>This appears to contradict your comment
<br>
<em>&gt; people with guns can do more bad things than people without.
</em><br>
<p>What could anyone have done, either way?
<br>
<p>Well, maybe if the people in the club had known he was dangerous, they might not have
<br>
chosen to be crowded into an upper floor of a run down wooden building with only one 
<br>
narrow staircase (the entrance); or they could have taken some sort of action to protect 
<br>
themselves. But they didn't, and once the gas hit the staircase they couldn't do anything.
<br>
<p>Apparently none of them decided, after he told the girl he'd be back, in an obviously agitated 
<br>
state: &quot;Hey, this man looks homicidal. Let's post a bouncer or two at the door
<br>
in case he comes back.&quot; 
<br>
<p>And they didn't call the cops. One big reason was that Happy Land Social Club had 
<br>
no license to operate. They were breaking the law (including the fire code) and everyone
<br>
present would see the cops as more of a threat than a help. Until the smoke started to 
<br>
gag people. It was too late to renovate and get a liquor license then.
<br>
<p>The following comment is a cultural one, not a racist one (sad that I need to say that):
<br>
<p>The occupants of the place were mostly Dominicans, the man who set the torch
<br>
was Puerto Rican. So there might have been some culture mismatch; the other major
<br>
dance club fire ever set in the US and Territories was in Puerto Rico; perhaps 
<br>
a Puerto Rican crowd would have read the man as a potent threat.
<br>
<p>Yes, people do go crazy. Arson is a major crime in the US and worldwide, and 
<br>
people die from it every day, and a lot of those cases (85% or so) are never solved, 
<br>
and the ones that are solved have a lot of deeply crazy people convicted. 
<br>
<p>Homicidal pyromania is absolutely no joke, and it scares me a lot.
<br>
<p>So: even though we need gasoline, here are a few ideas: we could require
<br>
a three day waiting period before one can have it sold to one in a portable
<br>
container. Or a psychiatric evaluation before dispensing.
<br>
Or an armed escort to make sure he only puts the fuel in a vehicle
<br>
after he buys it. Or only sell &quot;loose fuel&quot; to a licensed tow truck operator.
<br>
<p>We don't really need loose gasoline in our everyday lives.
<br>
<p>And a three day waiting period for battery acid--you've no doubt heard about
<br>
all the horrible disfigurement cases in Southeast Asia from jealous wives
<br>
dealing with their husbands' young mistresses? And the courts side with the
<br>
WIVES!
<br>
<p>We don't really need loose acid in our everyday lives.
<br>
<p>For the record: these sorts of things (arson, acid) bother me more than guns,
<br>
because they seem much more random and unfair. One bullet generally goes one place.
<br>
<p>And do I even need to mention the overmentioned fact that airliners are now 
<br>
fashionable mass murder weapons? No, I didn't think so.
<br>
<p>I have gotten used to dealing with these concerns by noticing that most of the time,
<br>
people around me act as if they are sane. That even includes people who probably
<br>
own guns. And it includes me, and I know I own a gun. And it includes my friend and
<br>
colleague who just applied to become a policeman.
<br>
<p>But let's go back to your issue:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once again: I am terrible afraid when I know that people around have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons. I am more afraid of any &quot;law abiding citizen&quot; who carries a gun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I am otherwise afraid of falling victim to a violent crime. (Running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amok woth a gun is a violent crime...)
</em><br>
<p>I try to understand the dimensions of your fear.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My feeling is that everyone who thinks he must carry a gun is so fearful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so near to the brink of paranoia that he is a high risk of eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going nuts.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. I accept that this is your fear. I do respect it; the world is actually full 
<br>
of scary things besides guns, but for you they are a big concern, right? 
<br>
<p>Yes. And, you will agree, &quot;people&quot; includes cops and the military, doesn't it?
<br>
Here's another anecdote:
<br>
<p>The only two crimes on record as having been committed with _licensed_ automatic 
<br>
weapons here in the US were both undertaken by off duty law enforcement agents.
<br>
One was deduced to be a crime of passion, the other was an assassination or &quot;hit&quot;.
<br>
<p>This leads me to my first two questions in this post:
<br>
<p>***
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Q1: So you are scared of the cops and the military when they're around, yes?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have guns, and they are people, and people go crazy.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>...and...
<br>
<p>***
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Q2: I own a gun and I don't go around with it, nor do I &quot;think I must&quot; these days.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But yes, it is possible for me to do so (possibly at risk of breaking some laws).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a member of any of the nearly 100 government agencies authorized to carry firearms freely.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently I live in the USA, and over more than 10 years I have received a considerable 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;amount of ongoing training in the safe and appropriate use of firearms.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does that put me in your fears? If I moved next door to you in the EC, would you worry
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that I'd snuck in a gun, or that I knew too much about them? Or what?
<br>

<br>
<p>PART 2: SOME THINGS THAT DO NOT SCARE MICHAEL M. BUTLER
<br>
<p>You might know that anyone (&quot;Joe Sixpack&quot;) can buy the materials to make an effective firearm
<br>
at a hardware store, most places in the world. Here in the US I could probably buy
<br>
what's needed for $3.00-$10.00 without shopping too hard. I will not spell the details out.
<br>
<p>The next question is not intended to browbeat you, but to probe your personal limits.
<br>
Please list the items that apply--I won't argue, I just want to know...
<br>
<p>***
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Q3: When does that (Joe Sixpack and the hardware store full of potential guns) become scary for you? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. When I announce the fact of it being possible? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. When Joe Sixpack goes to the hardware store for any reason, you can't tell why?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. When he buys stuff that could make the parts?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. When he buys exactly the parts needed?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. When he assembles them into a workable firearm, without any ammunition?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. When he leaves that, unloaded, in his car, garage, or house? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. When he goes out to his car with it and a box of ammunition?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. When he loads it with ammunition just before scuba diving 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joe is a marine biologist who solo dives a lot in Monterey Bay, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's a &quot;bang stick&quot;: last-resort protection from Great White sharks)? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. When he assembles exactly the parts needed, but 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put together to make a walking stick, instead of a gun?
<br>
***
<br>
<p>For the record, none of those things scare me very much, given no other data (such as, &quot;Joe has just escaped from the
<br>
Trenton Hospital for the Crimially Insane&quot;).
<br>
<p>However, (e) is probably illegal here (CA, USA) unless Joe has records on file as a firearms manufacturer 
<br>
and pays his taxes, etc. (f) might be unlawful depending on how large it is and how he stores it.
<br>
I'm not going to address any Federal aspects of this hypothetical case, and I Am Not A Lawyer, etc.
<br>
<p>What would scare me is Joe &quot;acting bad&quot;, say, pointing the thing in an inappropriate direction. And yes, if I saw him
<br>
carrying it, I'd keep an eye on him. But that's it, unless or until he does something I consider dangerous. But I am
<br>
willing to trust Joe some. Especially if I know him.
<br>
<p>***
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Q4: Does the fact that I know how to make Joe's &quot;bang stick&quot; scare you, and/or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am I scarier now that you know that I could make one or teach others how?
<br>
***
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I repeat my most important question, which I've not yet seen you answer:
<br>
<p>***
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Q5: What magic is there that transforms an ordinary person into a trustworthy one?
<br>
***
<br>
<p>Your .sig says
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced&quot;
</em><br>
<p>So kindly answer Q5, please. 
<br>
<p>Some day soon, you'll find some amped-up Flagnib standing next to you carrying a set of FULLY MILITARY-SPECIFICATION
<br>
TORM RINGS, and they'll look to be set on strong alignment.
<br>
<p>Will you be scared? Should you be? How will you tell?
<br>
<p>Utterly seriously,
<br>
<p>MMB
