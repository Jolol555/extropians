<em>&gt; In one word, NO. Corporations do not create anything through their own
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; janitor doesn't create a building or machine design, doesn't design a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logo or ad campaign. The secretary doesn't create a business plan or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program an application. It is individual human beings who create.
</em><br>
<p>You are focusing on the issue of creativity here, while I was looking
<br>
at larger issues of ownership, liability, responsibility, etc.
<br>
<p>But even if we look just at creativity, you will agree that groups
<br>
are able to create things that the individuals alone could not have
<br>
accomplished.  Look at all the famous partnerships in history, Rogers
<br>
and Hammerstein, Lennon and McCartney, Watson and Crick.  Or take your
<br>
own example of biological creation.  No individual can create a baby,
<br>
it has to be done by a couple.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any creation of art should be credited to those individuals who created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, in proportion to the degree of their original creative contribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the final result, and any financial gain from the sale of said art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be in proportion to their respective degree of contribution.
</em><br>
<p>I think it is up to the people involved to decide how to divide up the
<br>
financial gain.  I am surprised that you feel entitled to step in and
<br>
get involved in other people's business like this.  If you came into
<br>
my marriage and told me and my wife how to split up the results of our
<br>
collaboration in life I would tell you to get lost.
<br>
<p>Also, it seems doubtful to me that you can quantify creativity in the
<br>
manner you describe.  Recall Edison's dictum about genius being 99%
<br>
perspiration.  Even the janitors and secretaries play an important role
<br>
in the creative efforts of a group.
<br>
<p>But more importantly, think about the examples I suggested of future
<br>
applications of technology to allow people to work together much more
<br>
closely and intimately.  How will your philosophy adapt to a world where
<br>
minds are open systems which can interact and interconnect in ways far
<br>
more flexible than is possible today?
