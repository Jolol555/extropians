<em>&gt; Sorry, Mike, but when trials are closed, it's too easy to accuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone of being anything, whether they are or not.  PUBLIC trials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all offenses are a fundamental human right everywhere, under
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; trials for any reason is an enemy of freedom and justice.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, public trials for all offenses, provided the accused agrees to
<br>
surrender for trial with no caveats. If someone refuses to be captured
<br>
and remains a threat, how far should others risk their lives just so
<br>
they can have their trial whether they want it or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are certainly some aspects of the American judicial system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be changed: jury selection, rules of evidence, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedural details.  But openness isn't one of them: if anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American trials should be _more_ open: ALL of them, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those for suspected foreign terrorists.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so you think that jury members identities should be public knowledge
<br>
for terrorism trials? How naive.
