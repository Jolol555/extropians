<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;The key phrase here is &quot;as far as the economy is concerned&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;When we are talking about identity and survival, most people want &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;as far as I am concerned&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is exactly, precisely, what I was trying to say. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care if protoplasm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is destroyed because I am not two hundred pounds of protoplasm, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am a adjective.
</em><br>
<p>I believe the original claim was &quot;nothing was lost&quot;.  Now it's &quot;we don't
<br>
care about what was lost&quot;.  If that is the case then I think we are in
<br>
agreement.  The physical body doesn't matter.  The important question is
<br>
does the consciousness survive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the mass of beautiful?
</em><br>
Mass doesn't apply.  &quot;Beautiful&quot; is like temperature.  It is a quality of an
<br>
object.  I think I am seeing what you are getting at.  Any object can have
<br>
any temperature or beauty.  Therefore those qualities could be transferred
<br>
(like heat) from one object to another.  Temperature and beauty have
<br>
existence, but are not &quot;things&quot; in that they are not tied to any specific
<br>
atoms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tell me the position in space of the number eleven.
</em><br>
Wherever you store it.  (Another &quot;quality&quot; not a &quot;thing&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The premise of the thought experiment was that you could make a copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything,
</em><br>
<p>Ok.  Then I guess the real question is to identify what makes &quot;you&quot; so you
<br>
can copy it.  I agree with you that it's not the protoplasm.  I think I have
<br>
read on the list that some people think it's your memories.  I don't buy
<br>
that, because it would mean all amnesiacs are the same person.  (It would be
<br>
interesting to see if two amnesiacs, waking up in the same hospital and
<br>
interacting with the same staff would have different personalities.  This
<br>
might help indicate whether there is something more than memory at work.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;After all, I do have a natural clone walking around, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;something would be lost if one of us were destroyed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Come on now play fair, we both know a twin is not a copy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
At the time the copy was made, it was.  But you're right, in the present, we
<br>
are not copies.
