<p>A good Virginia Postrel article. Well worth the read and of relevence to us.
<br>
There's more than would be acceptable to post. Visit the URL for the whole

<br>
<p>riminalizing Science
<br>
<p>Leading thinkers and commentators respond to a left-right alliance to outlaw
<br>
&quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; and stigmatize genetic research
<br>
<p>In late August, I received an email from writer Michael Lind, forwarding a
<br>
striking document. It was a request that he add his name to a petition
<br>
against basic biomedical research. The lead signatories included not only
<br>
well-known technophobe Jeremy Rifkin and others on the anti-technology
<br>
fringes of the left but William Kristol and Francis Fukuyama, two pillars of
<br>
the respectable (and more-or-less secular) intellectual right. Lind himself
<br>
had refused the petition with a typically tart reply. He forwarded it to me
<br>
because he knew of my concerns that such de facto intellectual alliances
<br>
were coalescing against biotechnology, particularly biomedical research.
<br>
Like many who have seen the petition, he and I were surprised to see this
<br>
left-right alliance become so explicit. Clearly, these neoconservative
<br>
intellectuals had decided that human genetic research was so threatening to
<br>
their concept of human nature that it justified just about any political
<br>
coalitions.
<br>
<p>The specific bill supported by the Rifkin-Kristol petition would make
<br>
cloning human cells a criminal offense, punishable by up to 10 years in
<br>
prison and fines of $1 million. It would also make it a criminal offense to
<br>
import and use any treatments developed through this technique in countries,
<br>
such as the United Kingdom, where it is legal. The clones involved are not
<br>
people but tissues, matches of donor cells. But, like reproductive clones,
<br>
these cells &quot;could,&quot; under just the right circumstances, be implanted to
<br>
produce babies. So the bill has the political advantage of gathering votes
<br>
from lawmakers afraid of cloned humans. Before the September 11 attacks, it
<br>
had passed the House overwhelmingly. Under today's changed circumstances, it
<br>
may not reach the Senate for a vote this year. If so, it will almost surely
<br>
return in next year's session.
<br>
<p>As the petition's signers realize, there is more at stake here than just a
<br>
specific piece of legislation or the question of cloning cells. The bill
<br>
marks a nearly unprecedented attempt to make basic scientific procedures,
<br>
which harm no one, not just illegal but criminal. It thus departs from the
<br>
normal regulatory structure governing much biological research, a
<br>
distinction many scientists still do not entirely grasp. Unlike, say, Food
<br>
and Drug Administration regulations, these provisions could not be revised
<br>
as more information became available or risks changed. As Lind was quick to
<br>
note in his reply, this is not &quot;regulation&quot; but prohibition.
<br>
<p>The fundamental issue is not whether there will be cloned cells but whether
<br>
individuals will be allowed to change their bodies at the genetic level.
<br>
This is what the petition means when it opposes &quot;efforts to reduce human
<br>
life and its various parts and processes to the status of mere research
<br>
tools, manufactured products, commodities and utilities.&quot; For its signers,
<br>
genetic medicine is interference with human nature. For individuals with
<br>
genetic conditions they would like to change, genetic medicine is the hope
<br>
for a better life.
<br>
<p>In response to the petition, and as a way of educating scientists and the
<br>
general public about the threat this coalition poses to basic medical
<br>
research, I asked thoughtful individuals from a variety of disciplines for
<br>
their responses. (In all cases, individuals speak for themselves, and
<br>
affiliations are for identification purposes only.) Unlike a
<br>
&quot;counterpetition,&quot; this approach allows for diversity of political and
<br>
philosophical views. And, unlike the original petition, this collection of
<br>
responses is designed to clarify the questions involved, rather than simply
<br>
sow fear of the future.
