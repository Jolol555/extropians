<p>I've flown a good deal, and on descent, when you are both losing
<br>
altitude and speed, you are most certainly nose downward, especially
<br>
when you are on approach to some of the more noise restrictive airports.
<br>
The aircraft generally rotates nose up in the last couple thousand yards
<br>
prior to reaching the runway marker.
<br>
<p>It is true, though, that ascent has generally a greater angle of attack
<br>
than the descent has a negative angle of attack, with greater
<br>
acceleration on takeoff as well.
<br>
<p>For me, the major hangups with flying are narrow seats and no leg/foot
<br>
room, though I hate window seats in Airbus planes. Give me an L-1011 in
<br>
the old TWA installation (coach seats were nearly what first class is
<br>
today) any day. For everything else, there is always dramamine....
