<em>&gt; In discussions with a friend last night I was told that she

<em>&gt; in Russia had gone missing.  Google and Altavista searches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't seem to locate anything on this (for me).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've got an older (1990) medical textbook that says the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samples were supposed to be in Moscow.  A more recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web page discussing various bioterrorist threats
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; facility in Novisibirsk (if my memory serves correctly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; News discussions on television seem to suggest that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old vaccinations may have only had a protective life of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10 years (so if you are my age and think you are protected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you may not be).
</em><br>
<p>An 'expert' on CNN last night said that there is no use in conducting
<br>
mass immunizations ahead of time to help prevent any possible outbreak
<br>
from spreading, on the logic that some 1 in a million people have
<br>
mortally allergice reactions to the vaccine, and that people that are
<br>
HIV positive also cannot be vaccinated. Frankly I don't see the logic.
<br>
Just immunize everybody who isn't HIV positive that wants it, and test
<br>
people for the allergy before you vaccinate. They are putting all of us
<br>
at risk simply because of a risk to a few percent of the population.
<br>
They don't realize that by immunizing the rest of us, this reduces the
<br>
chance that those unimmunized will ever be exposed in the event of an
<br>
outbreak.
