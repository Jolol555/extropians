<p><p>I actually looked into this a few years ago, as incorporated towns have very
<br>
broad powers at their disposal in some States.  However, at least in States
<br>
where I looked it up, these towns automagically lose their incorporated
<br>
status if their population falls below a certain number unless incorporation
<br>
is specially enacted by the State legislature (an exemption that maintains
<br>
status regardless of population).  Therefore, most ghost towns no longer
<br>
have legal status as a town.
<br>
<p>The State where I was most interested in was Nevada, which requires 250
<br>
eligible voters to incorporate an area as a town and 150 voters to maintain
<br>
incorporated status.  The State of Nevada bestows the Right of Home Rule to
<br>
incorporated townships (if they choose to exercise it -- most don't), which
<br>
gives them surprisingly broad powers to manage their own affairs.  By
<br>
&quot;manage their own affairs&quot; it means that the town can provide their own law
<br>
enforcement, courts, schools, fire departments, etc.  In short, Home Rule
<br>
usually means that the State delegates all authority to local officials to
<br>
manage things how they wish within the region that is exercising home rule
<br>
authority.  &quot;Home Rule&quot; varies from State to State, with some states
<br>
granting very broad and liberal interpretations of home rule, and other
<br>
states essentially not granting it at all.  Many of the rural western states
<br>
have very favorable home rule structures.  Nevada has a very liberal right
<br>
of home rule that applies to incorporated townships.  Idaho grants home rule
<br>
to counties; Boise county in Idaho (which does NOT contain the city by the
<br>
same name) is famous for being a home rule county which rarely lets Federal
<br>
agencies operate within its jurisdiction.
<br>
<p>As I'm sure you've surmised by now, if you and a bunch of your friends take
<br>
over the government of a home rule region in a State that grants very
<br>
liberal and broad home rule powers, it is about as close to having your own
<br>
country within a country as you are going to get.  Or if you don't want to
<br>
take over a home rule region, buy a big chunk of land in Nevada or similar
<br>
and have a bunch of your friends become registered voters in your township.
<br>
Having been in areas where the courts and law enforcement were strictly of
<br>
the home rule variety, I can say that in those regions the law is exactly
<br>
what the locals decide it is.  Worth mentioning is that a boatload of
<br>
exemptions to Federal laws exist if you are part of the local government in
<br>
a number of capacities.  Note that all the attendant problems of creating
<br>
governments and power structures apply, so be careful of what you wish for;
<br>
there are a few home rule areas in the U.S. that I can only describe as
<br>
oppressive in nature due to a few ambitious people taking over the system.
<br>
<p>That should be enough to get the imagination churning. :^)
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
