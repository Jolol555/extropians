<br>
<em>&gt; French
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   suffering index pretty low. I've not heard really sad French music 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet to be honest.
</em><br>
<p><p>French art seems generally joyful, that's true...
<br>
<p>However, you'll find in literature things with much overt suffering.
<br>
You can read &quot;Voyage au bout de la nuit&quot; [Journey to the end of night]
<br>
by Louis-Ferdinand Céline (1932), for example. (In fact one of my
<br>
favourite novels of 20th century, but I'm afraid one needs to read it
<br>
in French to grasp the beauty of it).
<br>
<p>In contemporary (and popular) literature, you have Michel Houellebecq
<br>
in which books suffering is overt, too. You can read by him the
<br>
little-known &quot;Rester vivant&quot; [Staying alive], which is a literary
<br>
manifesto entirely revolving around suffering (good and short) ; or
<br>
you can read the very popular &quot;Extension du domaine de la lutte&quot;
<br>
[Extension of the fighting field] (1997), his first novel which is a
<br>
nice expression of despair and suffering in the contemporary French
<br>
society. (short and easy to read)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/2290045764/">http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/2290045764/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a French crooner named Dany Brillant who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sings all about his broken heart, but he sounds incredibly happy.
</em><br>
<p><p>No that's a clown, not significant in any way. Only old ladies buy his
<br>
CDs for his fifties clothes and good, clean looks :-) In pop singers
<br>
you may try Miossec, who suffers with talent (try the CD &quot;Baiser&quot; [To
<br>
Fuck]). But maybe it's not quite popular enough to be
<br>
significant, though it's on the radios, etc. And then of course you
<br>
have JAcques Brel (never heard &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; ??)
<br>
<p>Also you have all the &quot;troubadours&quot; connection, and the &quot;pleiade
<br>
poets&quot; (16th cent.), but that's generally courteous suffering,
<br>
suffering for love, and so it's kind of fun at the same time :-)
<br>
<p>There is a beautiful 191 sonnets cycle called &quot;Les regrets&quot; [Regrets]
<br>
(1558), by Joachim Du Bellay (part of the &quot;pleiad poets&quot; mentionned
<br>
above), which evokes in very natural and simple verses the &quot;depression&quot;
<br>
of the author, while he's attached to the service of a French
<br>
ambassador in Italy.
<br>
<p><p>Actually, I think that literary creation is often linked with
<br>
suffering, whether it so appears (because the suffering is directly
<br>
evoked) or not. At least you have a strong and productive tradition
<br>
that works like that in France. Its nice to be happy, but what you
<br>
write might be boring, because there is nothing to &quot;save&quot; and to
<br>
&quot;transform&quot;, so nothing much LITERARY happens in the writing. Of
<br>
course you may transmit ideas, etc. But this you can do in essays,
<br>
too. FOr me literature is pretty much about this transformation.
<br>
<p>It's a bit like transhumanism : you don't do it if you're totally
<br>
happy with your present condition, welcoming death, for example, as
<br>
part of the marvelous natural order of things.
<br>
<p>So literature in that tradition oftens starts with suffering, or
<br>
discomfort at least. But when it works, it ends up bringing joy and
<br>
contentment. That's all the beauty of it :-)
<br>
<p>&quot;Voyage au bout de la nuit&quot; for example describes painful situations.
<br>
But when you read it with appreciation, you laugh, you are joyful, you
<br>
re-read for pleasure what you've just read, you go read it aloud to
<br>
your friends, etc. :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Italian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   This culture is probably as expressive (or more?) as the Greeks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I think that if you tied an Italian's hands behind their back, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be able to talk), but I don't know yet where are the suffering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; icons, if they exist. The Italian crooner Paolo Conte sounds rough and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gritty, like he's singing in a smoke-filled bar, but he doesn't sound 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like he is drowning in his sorrows. suffering index still undetermined.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think they are usually more melancholic than suffering. Like the
<br>
napolitan traditional songs, for example.
<br>
<p><p>Jacques
