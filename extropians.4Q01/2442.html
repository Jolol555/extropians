</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't think so, but I think we need to do a careful look into the
<br>
problem (I plan to do it together with a social democrat political
<br>
scientist friend - we have very different perspectives but can at least
<br>
discuss, and are both very interested in finding the answer). 
<br>
<p>I think the origin is easy to figure out: people feel threatened by
<br>
change, since that requires costly adaptation and most people evaluate
<br>
risks as greater than opportunities (we are likely very biased in the
<br>
other direction on this list). Add to this around 200 years of the idea
<br>
that society is driven by competition and struggle rather than
<br>
cooperation and trade, and you get a likely memetic source for such
<br>
ideas. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The concept of &quot;poor and powerless&quot; suggests that in some way their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival will be threatened.  But as &quot;we&quot; know there are plenty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of resources to support the population we can envision existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the planet within the next 50-100 years.  There is no need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for SIs to run around eliminating persons who choose to remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-post-human.  There seems to be no inherently obvious argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to why upevolution is required unless you propose an argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some amoral SI chooses to gobble up all the matter and energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locally available.
</em><br>
<p>Being poor and powerless has historically meant that your safety has
<br>
been in the hands of someone else, and that in turns has implied that
<br>
you were very seldom truly safe. This is likely to continue, even when
<br>
everybody is extremely wealthy and capable. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That slots neatly into a lot of political pre-programming and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gives us a ready-made organized political resistance to our projects. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People operate with meme sets that say &quot;If I'm alive, my current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating system (gene/meme-set) must be working.&quot;  It is change itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that produces the resistance -- not so much &quot;political pre-programming&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is, IMO, more &quot;genetic pre-programming&quot;.  Accelerating change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generates accelerating resistance because you have increasingly diminished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidence that your current gene/meme-set will ensure survival.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with this. One thing I have learned after starting to really
<br>
read up on the history of ideas, philosophy, media and the ideas of our
<br>
opponents is that ideology matters a lot. To take an example, why would
<br>
the resistance to genetic engineering develop as fast as it has, when
<br>
directly applicable products (=change) have not appeared until recently?
<br>
The protests started in the 70's, long before even the basic experiments
<br>
were done. The increased resistance is to a large extent due to the
<br>
formation of very capable institutions and memetic channels for the
<br>
resistance, regardless of the factual threats to gene/meme-set. Change
<br>
may be the basic emotional fuel, but the motor is ideology. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've looked briefly at the &quot;The ETC Century&quot; and its a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece.  It isn't clear to me from glancing at it (I haven't read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all 128 pages in detail) what their primary gripe is.  It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are afraid that corporations will end up concentrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and controlling the technologies, ascerbating inequalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying the environment &amp; biodiversity.  It discusses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty much everything -- biotech, nanotech, human performance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancement, bioterrorism, global media enterprises, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Note that it also suggests that all these are connected and should be
<br>
resisted. They are just waiting for somebody to give them a name for
<br>
this immense evil that must be crushed... Maybe it would be
<br>
&quot;hyperhumanism&quot; or &quot;anti-entropism&quot; or something like it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One interesting quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;As our survival base erodes and uncertain new technologies muscle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their way into our social infrastructure, extraordinarily powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new corporate configurations are replacing governments and engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new systems of control over almost everything.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to come across as anti-technology and anti-change in general.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But they are also far better than us at getting their ideas across
<br>
(where is the corresponding transhumanist report?), getting funding and
<br>
getting the ears of politicians and lobbyists. This group is hardly the
<br>
most skilled in this respect, but I was got a real fright when I noticed
<br>
that the little lady next to me at a genetics conference last week had
<br>
one of their reports in her paper pile. They are getting widespread.
<br>
<p>At the same time, note that we do not have the huge conspiracy of
<br>
corporate power they assume supporting us! One reason is that we have
<br>
not been working enough to connect with the right networks, another is
<br>
that the &quot;corporate conspiracy&quot; doesn't really exist and at least is
<br>
ideologically not aware. Why else would Monsanto fail so totally at
<br>
handling the anti-GMO opinion? One thing we saw again and again in our
<br>
work with the book was that the pro-genetics side failed at addressing
<br>
ethical issues - it was always the opposition that had ethical claims,
<br>
and most attempts to counter them simply tried to show them to be
<br>
factually wrong rather than to show that genetic engineering can be the
<br>
ethical thing to do and relinquisment unethical. This is a huge hole I
<br>
think a mature transhumanist philosophy can fill - and actually act as
<br>
the glue creating a powerful force for technology and change - but we
<br>
need a lot of work to get there. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The thing is that the technologies *will* make &quot;current inequalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *worse*&quot; but it seems to me that you will have a fair amount of choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to precisely *where* you want to be in terms of your use of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies (a pre-post-human Amish lifestyle to an uploaded Jupiter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brain).  In that respect, the report seems to want to push us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the direction where every individual *is* precisely equal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So much for cultural diversity.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you look at the political undertones and ideological pedigree
<br>
of the document it becomes fairly clear why having everybody equally
<br>
poor is seen as better than having them inequally rich.
