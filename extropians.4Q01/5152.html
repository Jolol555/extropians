<em>&gt; &gt; Similar trends apply to the UK as well.  As has been mentioned in the past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at the beginning of the 20th century when guns were totally unregulated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the UK, the murder rate was substantially lower than it was at the end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the 20th century when handguns were basically outlawed.  The same goes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overall violent crime rates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not quite right; I think you need to put these statements in a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context to interpret them correctly. Some of the relevant statistics are at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-111.pdf">http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-111.pdf</a> (section 6)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although the UK homicide rate has indeed risen from 9.6/million in 1900 to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 14.1/million in 1997, this is in the context of a much greater rise in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime, from 2.4/thousand to 89.1/thousand. If you look at the statistics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will see that most of the rise in these rates has taken place since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1970. So homicide rates as a proportion of all crime has fallen.
</em><br>
<p>However, these numbers are all suspect, since the UK, for the last
<br>
several decades, counts crimes differently than the rest of the world.
<br>
If, for instance, you kill three people in one day, or rob a dozen banks
<br>
in the same day, the UK police and statisticians will treat it all as
<br>
one crime. This obviously causes the statistics to significantly
<br>
underreport.
<br>
<p>You should also notice that the largest increases in crime in the UK
<br>
*followed* the imposition of more restrictive gun laws.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, since the most draconian gun ban in the mid-90's, crime in
<br>
Britain has continued to rise, while in the US, crime has fallen by half
<br>
in the past decade, despite a 40% increase in gun ownership.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Context: firearms play a miniscule role in UK homicides. In recent years the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *absolute numbers* (compare with a typical US city) of handgun homicides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have fluctuated from a low of 7 (in 1988) to a high of 42 (in 1999) - source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this is <a href="http://www.gun-control-network.org/CrimStats0101.htm">http://www.gun-control-network.org/CrimStats0101.htm</a>. That's for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole country. So if we assume the UK population is ~60 million, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; late 90s there were about 850 homicides in the UK per annum, with between 7
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 42 being related to firearms.  In other words between 0.8-5.0% of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homicides in the UK are related to the use of guns. Guns were used in only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4.7% of UK robberies in 1999, so don't play a very big role in non-homicide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent crime either.
</em><br>
<p>So what does this say? It says that criminals will always find other
<br>
means to commit crimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conclusions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Guns are outlawed (or severely restricted) in the UK
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Guns do not make any significant contribution to homicide in the UK
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Guns do not play any significant role in violent crime in the UK
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Although overall murder rate has risen over 100 years, this is vastly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outstripped by a rise in all crime, and is not accompanied by any specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise in the murder rate attributable to guns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, I think your implicit argument that controlling guns (in the UK)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unrelated to the use of guns for murder is completely incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Observationally, guns are outlawed in the UK and the homicide rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attributable to guns is very small. Of course, this doesn't mean there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causal connection; but it's certainly an interesting observation!
</em><br>
<p>Yet there are over 3 million illegally owned firearms in the UK (and
<br>
this number continues to rise), none of which is threatened in any way
<br>
by further restrictions on firearms ownership, or increases in
<br>
penalties.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, a conclusion you forgot is that:
<br>
<p>5. When criminals are denied access to one weapon, they will find
<br>
another for the same purpose.
<br>
6. Gun bans only impact legal ownership by law abiding citizens. 
<br>
7. Criminals never worry about where they get the tools of their trade.
<br>
8. Disarming law abiding citizens only does nothing to reduce crime, and
<br>
does, in fact increase crime by making crime less risky to the safety of
<br>
the criminal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technically, you are of course correct that in the UK total homicide rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gun control are uncorrelated, but this is for the completely trivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason that over 95% of homicides in the UK do not involve guns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It should also be noted that virtually all of the concentrations of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crime in the US occur in locales where firearms have been banned or severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; restricted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting - can you provide more details? I wasn't aware that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific locations in the US where firearms are banned? Are you talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about neighborhoods, states, cities, what?
</em><br>
<p>Most large cities have far more restrictive gun laws than the states in
<br>
which they are located, and states and cities that are dominated by the
<br>
Democratic Party politically have far more restrictive gun laws than
<br>
those that are not (note that most laws restricting carrying of
<br>
concealed weapons date back to the passage of Jim Crow laws, to prevent
<br>
blacks from protecting themselves from KKK raiders, who were usually
<br>
armed by local law enforcement authorities.)
<br>
<p>San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, St. Louis, and
<br>
many other such cities highly restrict the carrying of concealed weapons
<br>
by law abiding private citizens, if not banning such outright. These
<br>
cities also exhibit the highest violent crime rates. If you remove the
<br>
crime data originating from such restrictive jurisdictions from US
<br>
violent crime rates, you will find that the corrected crime rate is far
<br>
lower than most other industrialized nations (you will also find that
<br>
removing these large democrat controlled cities from the mix helps to
<br>
make the US demographics to compare more similarly to other
<br>
industrialized nations).
