<em>&gt; In this case the only ones arguing for abandonment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convention are those who hope to gain from it.
</em><br>
<p>Um, why would anyone aregue for anything except because he
<br>
hopes to gain?  The question is whether or not society as a
<br>
whole would gain.  I think what you mean to say here is that
<br>
the only ones arguing for elimination of copyrights are
<br>
those who hope to gain _at the expense of others_ by it,
<br>
and that they do not believe suc elimination would be good
<br>
for society as a whole.
<br>
<p>This is also demonstrably false.  I currently, and have always,
<br>
made my living by writing (text and software).  I currently
<br>
get no gain from copyright because I write software for my
<br>
company's internal exclusive use, but I have also written text
<br>
and software for companies that used copyright (which I consider
<br>
a moral failing on my part that I am glad to have ended).  It
<br>
is quite likely that if I have to go looking for work again, I
<br>
will find many more jobs from companies that rely on copyright
<br>
than from those that don't, so it is not in my personal short-
<br>
term interest to abolish copyright.  I just think it's the
<br>
right thing to do.  And so do other producers of information,
<br>
like musician John Perry Barlow and many in the free software
<br>
movement like Richard Stallman.
