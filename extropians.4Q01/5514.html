<em>&gt; You forget: they think they own the law.  The only defense they believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they need is the legal system itself, and they believe they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently defended by it against all comers, now and forever.  (No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how good a lawyer is, when the law is clear and explicit on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain matter and the facts are known well enough, the outcome tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be predetermined.  Which is kind of the point of laws.)
</em><br>
<p>Although it is worth noting that law has become so complex that it really is
<br>
no better than a coin toss or how good your lawyers are, or what the judge
<br>
thinks, and indirectly how much money and influence you have that matters
<br>
far more than the written law. We're really paying through the nose for a
<br>
system that's no better than improvised tribal justice prior to formalized
<br>
law.
<br>
<p>Laws, as they stand right now, don't work as they are intended to.
