I have seen it on tv and I definitely look forward to buy one. I
<br>
understand it will be sold to consumers in one-two years and by that
<br>
time we can be sure there will be already improvements on the current
<br>
performance. As it happens, this technology will improve much faster
<br>
if other companies are allowed to work on it.
<br>
Some other thoughts:
<br>
The impact of the segway in Europe may be even bigger than in the US.
<br>
We have smaller, more compact, overpopulated cities with shorter
<br>
distances and chronical parking problems. At the same time we have
<br>
hilly and bumpy city roads, I wonder how the segway performs on those.
<br>
One of my first thoughts was, what do I do with the segway once I get
<br>
to destination, and how I make sure that it is not stolen. We can be
<br>
sure that street kids will learn immediately how to work around
<br>
whatever antitheft device is installed. So the best solution is to
<br>
carry it to office, shop, friend home, etc. Here weight is a problem,
<br>
30 kilos is too much for most people.
<br>
Top speed is another issues, 20 km/hour is a step in the good
<br>
direction but still too slow for sustained routine use.
<br>
Anyway I am sure that in a few years we will be able to buy lighter,
<br>
faster and cheaper models, and then the quality of life in cities will
<br>
improve a lot.
