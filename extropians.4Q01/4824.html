<p>Actually, altho I hadnt thought of it until you pointed it out, black roads
<br>
*would* be better for traction.  A black road would be slightly warmer
<br>
in the sunshine, all the better to melt the ice and evaporate the water
<br>
which would otherwise be more of a problem on a lighter colored surface.
<br>
<p>Chuck, I now recall seeing a vacant parking lot the morning after a
<br>
light snow.  The black surfaces were ice free and dry, whereas the
<br>
white lines painted on the surface had about a cm of ice left.  As you
<br>
point out, concrete roads are a special case, since they are inherently
<br>
rough, good for traction in wet weather.  But asphalt is cheaper.
<br>
Looks like we are stuck with boring old black roads.  spike
