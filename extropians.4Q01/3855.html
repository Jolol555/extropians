Responding to my comments about the difficulty of not viewing advanced
<br>
SysOps as competitors or &quot;parents&quot;, Brian D Williams wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about &quot;inherent order&quot; or &quot;inherent emerging order&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't like the idea of &quot;emergent&quot; because it suggests a
<br>
lack of &quot;intelligence&quot;.  Everything we see in Nature is
<br>
&quot;emergent&quot; and it is rather ruthless with regard to what
<br>
information it keeps (that which is optimized for survival
<br>
in a very local environment) and which it destroys
<br>
(that which is suboptimal for the local environment).
<br>
<p>Intelligence would seem to involve some historical perspective
<br>
and potential predictive capacity such that would would not discard
<br>
information simply because it is not &quot;immediately&quot; relevant.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Perhaps another way of looking at this is that &quot;emergent&quot;
<br>
behavior is trying to defeat the &quot;local&quot; hazard function.
<br>
&quot;Intelligent&quot; behavior is trying to defeat the *global*
<br>
hazard function.  (At least when viewed along the &quot;longevity&quot;
<br>
vector.)
<br>
<p>I don't think &quot;inherent&quot; works well because the intelligence
<br>
that one expects to be built into an &quot;intelligent substrate&quot;
<br>
is almost a post-emergent property, while &quot;inherent&quot; suggests
<br>
a pre-emergent property.
<br>
<p>I think you want to reflect a globally dispersed feeling with
<br>
overtones of &quot;goodness&quot;.  Thinking briefly &quot;The Wisdom Matrix&quot;,
<br>
comes to mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Since the vectors discussed are orthogonal we need a 3D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;graph (or perhaps a space mapping) of the various positions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;similar to that which Max provided for IDENTITY.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A very good idea.
</em><br>
<p>I second the motion.  Anders offered a fairly complete view
<br>
of the anti-cloning perspectives.  Max did the same for Identity.
<br>
These give us places where we can individually stand and reflect from.
<br>
We will continue to have neener-neener debates on the list until
<br>
we see the various positions clearly relative to one another
<br>
and are able to understand how others' experiences, history, genetics,
<br>
or education may be selecting for why they occupy some spot on the
<br>
map.
<br>
<p>To make this work such summaries need to be turned into reference
<br>
documents on the ExI site -- so when the debates come up on the
<br>
list from newbies, we send them off to RFM (Read the Foundation
<br>
Material)...
<br>
<p>With 90,000 messages in the archives one has to believe that
<br>
most of it has been said before and that someone actually distilled
<br>
much of it into something coherent.  But finding it is problematic --
<br>
we need a program to turn pearls of wisdom into chariots of gold
<br>
free for the taking outside the forum.
