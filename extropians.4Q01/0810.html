<em>&gt; &gt; As I viewed downtown Manhattan from the air this week,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I pondered the terrorist threat of an internet worm designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to crash the whole net, bringing down email, everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be honest, it's a big mystery why this hasn't happened.  So many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political and extremist groups have used worms to attack the net that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events are conspicuously absent right now.  The only theory that makes sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me is that such small fry fear being associated with the big terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they are all lying low right now.
</em><br>
<p>I've got a theory of my own that seems to fit the facts:
<br>
<p>Only those trained (formally educated or self taught doesn't matter, so
<br>
long as the skills are there) in a field of expertise have the
<br>
capability to exploit it for great harm, in most of the nightmare
<br>
scenarios being floated around (cyber-war, mass-scale bio/chem attacks,
<br>
et cetera).  However, those same people are also largely those who
<br>
personally benefit from positive employment of said knowledge.
<br>
<p>For example, say you were a biotech expert.  You could develop a black
<br>
market plague, reaping several million dollars and eternal secrecy (and
<br>
all the extra effort your future life will require because of it), not
<br>
to mention the possibility that the plague will mutate and infect you
<br>
and your loved ones.  Or, for about the same effort, or you could
<br>
develop a miracle drug and reap several billion dollars and much fame
<br>
(which will mostly fade over time, returning your life to normalcy if
<br>
you so wish).  Those who do the most damage are by and large those
<br>
uneducated in the system, and routed by more competent people...or even
<br>
those who are just as uneducated, but whose initial inclinations are
<br>
not as mischevious.
<br>
<p>There's a reason that script kiddies grow up to become white hat
<br>
security consultants.
<br>
<p>Additional fact: there are such things as virus and worm proof systems.
<br>
They often require proper use, to avoid trojans and such getting into
<br>
the system; in fact, often times the difference between a secure system
<br>
and an insecure system is mostly how it is used, as opposed to the
<br>
software (though selecting software that does not, for instance,
<br>
automatically run email attachments does help).
<br>
<p>If I may say so, I am composing this email on such a system right now.
<br>
It's an ordinary Win98 box, but it is configured to be inaccessible
<br>
from the outside world: I can send email out and get it from my server,
<br>
but any new sockets coming in are denied.  Any email with an executable
<br>
attachment (which includes Office files) is deleted instead of invoked.
<br>
Javascript is off unless I want it on, and then only while I visit a
<br>
specific, trusted site.  Et cetera.
<br>
<p>Critical systems are not always as secure, but most of them tend to be
<br>
this way.  The businesses that run them lose large amounts of money if
<br>
their customer-serving boxes ever get compromised.
