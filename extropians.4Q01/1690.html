<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since this is NOT a civilian criminal case. This is a war. They ain't

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we disagree about quite a few things, I'm afraid I agree 
<br>
with Samantha here.  Coercing information out of these prisoners would not 
<br>
be a good idea.  First of all, If these people were prisoners of war they 
<br>
would be protected by the third Geneva convention.  However, war has not 
<br>
been declared, and these were not troops &quot;captured at the front lines,&quot; 
<br>
&quot;openly bearing weapons,&quot; or many of the other things that have to be true 
<br>
for somebody to be a POW.  Where does that leave us?  These people are 
<br>
technically civilians.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Bin Laden's network operates on the &quot;need to know&quot; 
<br>
principle I doubt that any of people we are holding have information that 
<br>
could be used to prevent other terrorist attacks, at least in the short term.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until these people are convicted they deserve the protection of US 
<br>
law, including the 5th amendment.  After conviction criminals do have to 
<br>
give up some rights, and I could live with the use of truth serum so long 
<br>
as it wasn't &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; just so long as we are dead 
<br>
sure that these people really were terrorists.  The evidence against these 
<br>
people was pretty impressive, but the stuff that I know about was 
<br>
circumstantial, and so not enough to violate constitutional rights over.
