</em><br>
<p>I made such a case.  If you consciously attack someone with the intent
<br>
of having them seriously question whether their position is wrong,
<br>
perhaps &quot;wrong&quot; as in &quot;seriously evil&quot; or based entirely on facts
<br>
generally accepted as erroneous (e.g. &quot;the holocost never happened&quot;,
<br>
&quot;we never landed on the moon&quot;, etc.), then you are doing it in an
<br>
attempt to be of service to the other individual.
<br>
<p>For example, I think if in response to my proposed response to the 911
<br>
attacks, someone had said, &quot;Look Robert you blithering idiot, thats just
<br>
wrong, you are such a complete asshole&quot;, I think the attack would
<br>
have been justified.  Of course the attack would have to be accompanied
<br>
by the reasons the source feels that is the case (otherwise it is mere
<br>
name calling).  I doubt many of us give such careful thought as to
<br>
whether such words will be able to have the desired effect on specific
<br>
individuals that many of us can use that tactic effectively.
<br>
<p>As I said previously, such attacks may only be effective when accompanied
<br>
by appropriate facial cues, vocal tones, or perhaps when you know the
<br>
individual personnally and there is a greater than average respect
<br>
quotient between the people involved.
<br>
<p>So I hereby grant people limited rights for ad hominem attacks against
<br>
me *provided* they are doing it within the guidelines outlined above.
<br>
<p>If you want to preserve the &quot;geniality&quot; of the list, then simply do it
<br>
to me offlist.
<br>
<p>Robert
