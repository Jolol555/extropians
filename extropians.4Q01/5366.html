A Supercomputer in Every Garage!
<br>
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20011227.html">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20011227.html</a>
<br>
The process is moving forward only as I can afford it, but so far I have six
<br>
new dual Athlon XP motherboards, each with a pair of 1.4-GHz processors, a
<br>
gigabyte of DDR RAM for each machine, and a total of 24 network adapter cards.
<br>
These will all plug into a 24-port 10/100 network switch to create a flat
<br>
network neighborhood. While my supercomputer won't be quite as fast as KLAT2,
<br>
it will be a lot smaller and cheaper at right around 24 gigaflops, which is
<br>
comparable to a top-of-the-line Cray T90 supercomputer from 1998. And while
<br>
that Cray cost millions, my out-of-pocket supercomputer budget is $6,000.
<br>
Unlike KLAT2, the operating system for my little supercomputer won't be Linux.
<br>
It will be QNX, a real time OS that supports massive parallelism and has very
<br>
low overhead. QNX is fast! QNX is also Posix compliant, so there is lots of
<br>
software that almost works under it. And even though QNX is a commercial
<br>
operating system, it is free for noncommercial purposes like mine.
<br>
Beyond using it to heat my office, I plan to keep the supercomputer busy with
<br>
a video compression project I'm doing as well as further experiments in
<br>
wireless communication. Having not learned any painful lessons from my long
<br>
distance 802.11b experiments, I've decided to get even wackier in my attempts
<br>
to improve Internet connectivity and will be looking into Ultra Wide Band
<br>
networking. UWB is a form of wireless data communication that uses radio in a
<br>
completely different way, sending short pulses of energy across the entire
<br>
zero to 60 GHZ frequency band. Not long ago, only spies and Secret Service
<br>
agents used this stuff, but now there are many companies, including Intel,
<br>
that are developing UWB chipsets. UWB could replace communications of all
<br>
types, ending forever our dependence on wires and making worthless the
<br>
ownership of radio frequencies.
<br>
UWB is like magic or quantum mechanics, whichever you prefer. It is immune to
<br>
interference just as it doesn't interfere with traditional radio signals, so
<br>
the FCC is considering UWB as an unlicensed service across all frequency
<br>
bands -- even cellphones and broadcast frequencies. How could they regulate
<br>
communications they can't even detect? UWB uses one ten thousandth the energy
<br>
of networks like 802.11b, yet offers the prospect of greater range and greater
<br>
privacy along with data rates that are presently around 60 megabits-per-second
<br>
and might eventually hit one gigabit-per-second. UWB is virtually undetectable
<br>
by traditional radios, since its signals are considered noise -- noise spread
<br>
across such a wide band as to be beneath the threshold of traditional
<br>
receivers. UWB uses multipath interference as a form of error correction! What
<br>
was formerly considered bad is now good. In fact, UWB only works at all
<br>
because we know precisely where and when to listen. It is based on a complex
<br>
and very rigidly-structured encoding scheme, and that's where my little
<br>
supercomputer comes in.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
