<p>
Harvey deferred when cryofan asked about the sticky problems
<br>
of libertarianism and immigration.  I tend to agree with
<br>
Harvey that there isn't an easy solution, but I will attempt
<br>
to parse some of the stickybuns...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the Extropian movement is heavily invested in libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy,
</em><br>
<p>(Begin Side-bar -- Is it true the Principles are not linked into the current
<br>
ExI web site???  If so, I'd request this be fixed ASAP.  I'm lucky
<br>
I had an old link in my history file... End Side-bar).
<br>
<p>Checking both the Principles and the FAQ, I see no mention of
<br>
&quot;libertarian&quot;.  In fact &quot;politics&quot; is only mentioned once in
<br>
either document and only then from the perspective that we
<br>
should not &quot;surrender independent judgement&quot; with regard to it.
<br>
<p>Libertarianism creeps in on the heels of &quot;freedom&quot;, particularly
<br>
IMO on the &quot;freedom&quot; to evolve.  However(!) the Principles also
<br>
cite the importance of &quot;personal responsibility&quot;.  I suspect that
<br>
&quot;personal responsibility&quot; involves a great deal of the self image
<br>
an individual may have and what communities one views oneself most
<br>
closely connected to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which purportedly stresses individual rights and property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, how do the Extropians reconcile the &quot;open borders&quot; philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocated by Extropians,
</em><br>
<p>This trips *right* into the transhumanist ethical dilemma.
<br>
I'll state it as harshly as I can -- do &quot;individual&quot; rights
<br>
(from which property rights derive as an enforcement mechanism)
<br>
entitle one to claim a greater share of the computronium (matter
<br>
&amp; energy) and thereby deny others with relatively equivalent
<br>
a priori claims their fair share?
<br>
<p>I think this can be simplified -- &quot;Which is better -- natural
<br>
selection or fairness?&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm fairly sure that I've said it before but it is probably worth
<br>
repeating -- if you opt for fairness (the human &quot;social animal&quot;
<br>
preference most likely) you are likely to end up with sub-optimal
<br>
adaptations.
<br>
<p>This is in some respects a recasting of the captialism vs. socialism
<br>
or communism approaches to societal organization (yea, I'm sure the
<br>
readers well versed in political history may slice this analogy into diced
<br>
ham, but from my arm-chair position [not too different from J. Q. Public]
<br>
it works).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with the fact that most American citizens oppose open borders
</em><br>
<p>In spite of the fact that most Americans are descended from
<br>
people who took advantage of relatively open borders.
<br>
In part this is natural human xenophobia and in part this
<br>
is simple economics -- wanting to preserve the advantages
<br>
(position, connections, environmental adaptations, etc.)
<br>
that one has developed over one or more generations.
<br>
<p>Make it really simple -- Why should I as a taxpayer with
<br>
no children in the city of Seattle be paying taxes to educate
<br>
the children of the XYZZY class of immigrants?  The only
<br>
rational arguments I can make for this are if I plan to be
<br>
an employer and I expect to need an educated workforce
<br>
(or an extropian who would like more educated rational
<br>
people in the world -- but that is probably really stretching
<br>
the public educational system).
<br>
<p>The immigration system by its very nature was designed to
<br>
promote production -- ~200 years ago it was designed to
<br>
promote the production of furs.  ~100-150 years ago it was
<br>
designed to promote the production of metals and food.
<br>
~50-100 years ago it was designed to promote industrial
<br>
manufacturing.  It is my sense that the immigration policy
<br>
is now passed on because those of us whose ancestors at one
<br>
point were able to use it as a point of leverage feel it
<br>
is only just that others should be able to do so as well.
<br>
In other words its a &quot;generous gift&quot; and not a &quot;right&quot;.
<br>
<p>To resolve this problem from an ethical perspective, one has
<br>
to construct a complete view of precisely what obligation
<br>
any human has with regard to the survival opportunities
<br>
of any and each other human.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seems as if Extropians would wish to trample
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual rights of most Americans by implementing open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; borders--not to mention taking the food out of the mouths of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class Americans by lowering wages with immigration...
</em><br>
<p>One could have an open border policy with no guarantess of
<br>
&quot;rights to work&quot; policy.  With sufficiently strict enforcement
<br>
there would be no lowering of wages.  One could have a
<br>
&quot;right to work&quot; and &quot;pay social security&quot; with no rights
<br>
to benefits.
<br>
<p>There are lots of possible architectures that would create
<br>
a more graduated system between the country from which people
<br>
might choose to emigrate and workin the U.S.A.  Adopting such
<br>
architectures places us in the middle of the &quot;fairness&quot; issue and
<br>
I think that is someplace that the American public and ExI are
<br>
currently unable to reasonably position themselves.
