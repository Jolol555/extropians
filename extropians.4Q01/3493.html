<em>&gt; And even if a posthuman utterance of stupefying complexity and depth were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translatable (by the posthuman, of course) portion-by-portion into English,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems to me perfectly possible that no human would be able to construe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the utterance.

</em><br>
<p>Right. And tested.

<br>
<p>&quot;In 1603, the Jesuit Ludovico Bertonio (Arte de la lengua Aymara) described 
<br>
the Aymara language (still partially spoken by Indians living between Bolivia 
<br>
and Peru) as endowed with an immense flexibility and capability of 
<br>
accommodating neologisms, particularly adapted to the expression 
<br>
of abstract concepts, so much so as to raise a suspicion that it was an 
<br>
artificial invention. Later this language was described as the language 
<br>
of Adam, founded upon necessary and immutable ideas&quot;, a philosophical 
<br>
language if ever there were, and obviously somebody discovered that it had 
<br>
Semitic roots.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;Recent studies have established Aymara is not based on an Aristotelian 
<br>
two-valued logic (either True or False), but on a three-valued logic it is, therefore, 
<br>
capable of expressing modal subtleties which other languages can only capture
<br>
through complex circumlocutions. Thus there have been proposals to use 
<br>
Aymara to resolve all problems of computer translation. Unfortunately, it has 
<br>
been demonstrated that the Aymara would greatly facilitate the translation of any 
<br>
other idiom into its own terms, but not the other way around. Thus, because of 
<br>
its perfection, Aymara can render every thought expressed in other mutually 
<br>
untranslatable languages, but the price to pay for it is that (once the perfect 
<br>
language has resolved these thoughts into its own terms), they cannot be 
<br>
translated back into our natural native idioms. Aymara is a Black Hole.&quot;
<br>
