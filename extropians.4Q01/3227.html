I have been thinking a lot about cryonics but have not signed up yet.
<br>
In my opinion the main difficulties with cryonics are:
<br>
1) The time between death and arrival of the cryonics team. Too long a
<br>
delay may cause irreversible damage to the brain structure and the
<br>
memories etc. encoded therein.
<br>
2) The fact that laws require a patient to have been officially
<br>
pronounced dead before cryonics preservation procedures can begin. One
<br>
would have a bigger chance of successful revival if cryonics
<br>
preservation procedures could start immediately after death or even
<br>
before.
<br>
3) The fact that the same laws may endanger a patient even after
<br>
preservation (forced autopsy etc.).
<br>
All these points are illustrated in &quot;the first immortal&quot; which I
<br>
assume many on the list have read. Carl Epstein is illegally preserved
<br>
in Cayman Islands, Katie is preserved immediately after legal assisted
<br>
suicide in the US, and Ben himself is very lucky to say the least.
<br>
Suppose I sign up with the Cryonics Institute (I would prefer it to
<br>
Alcor, which does not offer services to Europeans anyway). After
<br>
expenses and a lot of legal hassles I may irreversibly die waiting for
<br>
the team, or be unfrozen later for a decision of the court. I would
<br>
really prefer a more &quot;controlled&quot; procedure.
<br>
Now, take a country with cryonics friendly laws. For example I
<br>
understand that in the Netherlands a patient has a legal right to be
<br>
given eutanasy if (s)he can persuade two doctors. Let us suppose that
<br>
there are also laws against forced autopsy, etc.
<br>
Imagine an institution half a way between retirement home and terminal
<br>
patient care center, with a resident cryonics preservation team, state
<br>
of the art equipment, etc. Those committed to cryonics can go spend
<br>
their last years there, instead of going to a retirement home in
<br>
Florida or Nevada. When death approaches, eutanasy and preservation
<br>
procedures can be performed in optimal conditions and in such a way as
<br>
to maximize the chance of successful revival.
<br>
Now as an average person I would be willing to pay a reasonable fee
<br>
for the added value of &quot;pre-cryonics&quot; services over a conventional
<br>
retirement home (of course, provided I had the financial means but
<br>
this is another story). So I believe there is money to make in this
<br>
idea with a good business plan and a careful execution.
<br>
If you are a Dutch doctor or health services professional, why don't
<br>
you plan some services of this type? If you are doing so already even
<br>
better, tell me how to sign up!
