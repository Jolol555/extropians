<p><p><p>NONLOCAL MIND, DISTANT HEALING, AND PRAYER 
<br>
<p><p>© copyright by Larry Dossey, M.D. 
<br>
<p>The idea that the human mind is infinite or nonlocal - that at some
<br>
level
<br>
it cannot be confined to specific points in space, such as the brain and
<br>
body, or in time, such as the present, is ancient.   
<br>
One of the most universal expressions of nonlocal mind is prayer and
<br>
distant healing. 
<br>
What is prayer?  I define it arbitrarily and broadly as &quot;communication
<br>
with
<br>
the Absolute,&quot; and I invite anyone to refine this definition in his or
<br>
her
<br>
own way.  This definition is broad enough to encompass all the major
<br>
religions including nontheistic traditions such as Buddhism, in which
<br>
prayer is vital but is not directed  to a personal god. 
<br>
Researchers who do experiments in the field of prayer-and-healing often
<br>
prefer to use the term &quot;distant intentionality&quot; instead of prayer in
<br>
order
<br>
to avoid religious connotations and to emphasize the purposeful, mental
<br>
aspect of prayer.  I shall follow the same practice, although I
<br>
recognize
<br>
that in Western cultures prayer usually occurs in a religious context. 
<br>
Why should modern medicine concern itself with prayer and the nonlocal
<br>
actions of human consciousness? (Dossey, 2000)  Why should we be
<br>
concerned
<br>
about validating it and integrating these phenomena into healthcare?
<br>
One
<br>
might argue that such a phenomenon, even if it exists, ought to be set
<br>
aside in favor of less challenging questions, such as whether or not
<br>
one's
<br>
thoughts or prayers can affect one's own  body.  There are compelling
<br>
reasons to set our sights on the more elusive quarry at the outset.  If
<br>
distant effects of mental intentionality exist, we shall have to deal
<br>
with
<br>
them sooner or later, whether we like it or not.  If we acknowledge them
<br>
&quot;up front,&quot; they may lend a comprehensiveness to our thinking about the
<br>
dynamics of consciousness which otherwise would be sacrificed.
<br>
Acknowledging these phenomena early on might spare us at some later date
<br>
from having to retrofit our models in order to accommodate them, or
<br>
perhaps
<br>
having to scuttle our models altogether.  
<br>
<p>SIX QUESTIONS 
<br>
In asking whether or not prayer or mental intentions can bring about
<br>
changes in distant individuals, let's ask six questions.  The evidence
<br>
provided following each question is not exhaustive, but is intended to
<br>
only
<br>
suggest an answer. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(1)  Does an effect exist?  Is it possible - in principle - for
<br>
individuals to influence, at a distance, the physiological function of a
<br>
living organism?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Ten subjects tried to inhibit the growth of fungus cultures in
<br>
the
<br>
laboratory through conscious intent by concentrating on them for fifteen
<br>
minutes from a distance of approximately 1.5 yards.  The cultures were
<br>
then
<br>
incubated for several more hours.  Of a total of 194 culture dishes, 151
<br>
showed retarded growth (Barry, 1968). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  In a replication of this study, one group of subjects
<br>
demonstrated
<br>
the same effect (inhibiting the growth of fungal cultures) in sixteen of
<br>
sixteen trials, while stationed from one to fifteen miles away (Tedder
<br>
and
<br>
Monty, 1981).  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  Sixty subjects not known to have such abilities were able both
<br>
to
<br>
impede and stimulate significantly the growth of cultures of bacteria
<br>
(Nash, 1982). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)  Sixty university volunteers were asked to alter the ability of
<br>
a
<br>
strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli to utilize lactose.  This
<br>
strain
<br>
normally mutates from the inability to metabolize lactose (&quot;lactose
<br>
negative&quot;) to the ability to use it (&quot;lactose positive&quot;) at a known
<br>
rate.
<br>
The subjects tried to influence nine test tubes of bacterial cultures -
<br>
three for increased mutation from lactose negative to lactose positive,
<br>
three for decreased mutation of lactose negative to lactose positive,
<br>
and
<br>
three tubes uninfluenced as controls.  The bacteria mutated in the
<br>
directions desired by the subjects (Nash, 1984). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Seven subjects - two spiritual healers, one physician who was
<br>
interested in and believed in spiritual healing, and four students with
<br>
neither experience nor interest in healing - were asked to increase the
<br>
growth of yeast in test tubes &quot;by the mental method of his choice.&quot;  240
<br>
test tubes were used -- 120 for the mental intent, 120 for controls.
<br>
The
<br>
spiritual healers and the believing physician produced significant
<br>
results
<br>
(p&lt;0.00014) and the indifferent students produced chance results
<br>
(Haraldsson and Thorsteinsson, 1973). 
<br>
<p>(2)  Can such an effect influence intact animals? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In twenty-one experiments conducted over a period of several years,
<br>
healers tried to awaken mice more quickly from general anesthesia.
<br>
These
<br>
experiments were increasingly refined.  In one variation, only the image
<br>
of
<br>
the experimental mouse was projected on a television monitor to the
<br>
healer
<br>
in a distant room, who tried to intervene mentally via the image.
<br>
Nineteen
<br>
of the twenty-one studies showed highly significant results:  earlier
<br>
recovery from anesthesia in the mice to whom positive mental intent was
<br>
extended (Watkins and Watkins, 1971; Watkins, Watkins, and Wells, 1973;
<br>
Wells and Klein, 1972; Wells and Watkins, 1975). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a controlled experiment, a noncontact form of &quot;laying on of
<br>
hands&quot;
<br>
was employed in an attempt to cure mice of transplanted mammary
<br>
adenocarcinoma.  Three replications were done.  Overall, 29 of 33
<br>
experimental mice (87.9 percent) were cured of the cancer, compared to
<br>
18
<br>
of 26 control mice on site (69l2 percent) and 0 of 8 control mice off
<br>
site
<br>
(0 percent).   Later reinjection of tumor cells in treated, cured mice
<br>
did
<br>
not take (Bengston and Krinsley, 2000). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers injected 60 mice with a tumoral suspension.  Half of the
<br>
mice were treated with &quot;negative PK&quot; for 20 sessions and half were not,
<br>
and
<br>
the  weight and volume of tumor growth was measured.  The treated mice
<br>
showed significantly less tumor growth than untreated mice (P &lt;0.01)
<br>
(Onetto and Elguin, 1966). 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>(3)  Can such an effect influence biochemical processes in humans? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Blood platelets isolated from healthy human volunteers were treated by
<br>
a
<br>
healer, who tried to influence the activity of the enzyme monoamine
<br>
oxidase
<br>
(MAO).  MAO activity was measured before and after the mental intent in
<br>
both intact and disrupted cells.  The overall effect was to increase the
<br>
variability of MAO activity relative to untreated control samples
<br>
(p&lt;0.001) (Rein, 1985). 
<br>
<p>(4)  Can such an effect influence human tissue?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-two subjects mentally attempted to prevent the hemolysis of
<br>
human red blood cells (RBCs) in test tubes containing a hypotonic saline
<br>
solution, as measured by standard spectrophotometric techniques.
<br>
Significant differences were found between the &quot;prevent&quot; and control
<br>
tubes
<br>
(p&lt;1.91x10-5) (Braud, 1988). 
<br>
<p>(5)  Can such an effect influence intact humans ?  
<br>
<p>Scores of controlled studies have demonstrated the correlation of
<br>
positive
<br>
mental intent with physiological effects in distant human beings.  This
<br>
material has been the subject of several reviews (Benor, 1990, 1993;
<br>
Dossey, 1993; Solfvin, 1984).  Among the studies: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In a double-blind experiment involving 393 persons admitted to a
<br>
coronary care unit, intercessory prayer was offered from a distance to
<br>
roughly half the subjects.  Significantly fewer patients in the prayer
<br>
group required intubation/mechanical ventilation (p&lt;0.002) or
<br>
antibiotics
<br>
(p&lt;0.005), had cardiopulmonary arrests (p&lt;0.02), developed pneumonia
<br>
(p&lt;0.03), or required diuretics (p&lt;0.005).  Subjects in the prayer group
<br>
had a significantly lower &quot;severity score&quot; based on their hospital
<br>
course
<br>
following admission (p&lt;0.01) (Byrd, 1988).   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In a double-blind experiment involving 990 consecutive patients
<br>
who
<br>
were admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU), patients were randomized
<br>
to
<br>
receive remote, intercessory prayer or not.  The first names of patients
<br>
in
<br>
the prayer group were given to a team of outside intercessors who prayed
<br>
for them daily for 4 weeks.  Patients were unaware they were being
<br>
prayed
<br>
for, and the intercessors did not know and never met the patients.  The
<br>
medical course from hospital admission to discharge was summarized in a
<br>
CCU
<br>
course score derived from blinded, retrospective chart review.  The
<br>
prayed-for group had about a 10 percent advantage compared to the
<br>
usual-care group (P = .04)  (Harris et al, 1999). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  In a double-blind experiment involving 40 patients with
<br>
advanced
<br>
AIDS, subjects were randomly assigned to a &quot;distant healing&quot; (DH) group
<br>
or
<br>
to a control group.  Both groups were treated with conventional
<br>
medications, but the DH group received distant healing for 10 weeks from
<br>
healers located throughout the United States.  Subjects and healers
<br>
never
<br>
met.  At 6 months, blind chart review found that DH subjects acquired
<br>
significantly fewer new AIDS-defining illnesses (P = 0.04), had lower
<br>
illness severity (P = 0.03), and required significantly fewer doctor
<br>
visits
<br>
(P = 0.01), fewer hospitalizations (P  0.04), and fewer days of
<br>
hospitalization (P =0.04).  DH subjects also showed significantly
<br>
improved
<br>
mood compared with controls (P = 0.02) (Sicher et al, 1998). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) In thirteen experiments, the ability of sixty-two people to
<br>
influence the physiology of 271 distant subjects was studied (Braud and
<br>
Schlitz, 1983,1988,1989).  These studies suggested that (1) the distant
<br>
effects of mental imagery compare favorably with the magnitude of
<br>
effects
<br>
of one's individual thoughts, feelings, and emotions on one's own
<br>
physiology; (2) the ability to use positive imagery to achieve distant
<br>
effects is apparently widespread in the human population; (3) these
<br>
effects
<br>
can occur at distances up to twenty meters (greater distances were not
<br>
tested); (4) subjects with a greater need to be influenced by positive
<br>
mental intent - i.e., those for whom the influence would be beneficial
<br>
<pre>
--
seem more susceptible; (5) the distant effects of intentionality can
occur
without the recipient's knowledge; (6) those participating in the
studies
seemed unconcerned that the effect could be used for harm, and no such
harmful effects were seen; and (7) the distant effects of mental
intentionality are not invariable; subjects appear capable of preventing
the effect if it is unwanted. 
<p>(6)  Are these effects limited to human  intentionality, or are they
widespread in nature?  
<p>Claims that humans can achieve distant effects through mental intention
is
often met with skepticism and derision.  These objections might be
tempered
if it can be shown that this ability is present in nonhuman species as
well.   Although we do not know what animals think and whether or not
they
are really intending, there nonetheless is evidence suggesting that
&quot;animal
consciousness,&quot; however it may be defined, is capable of manifesting at
a
distance in ways not unlike those seen in humans.  
    (a)   Researchers tested  the possible influence of 80 groups of 15
chicks on a randomly moving robot carrying a lighted candle in an
otherwise
darkened room.  Baby chicks prefer to be in the presence of light; could
this preference somehow influence the movement of the candle-carrying
robot?  In 71% of the cases, the robot spent excessive time in the
vicinity
of the chicks.  In the absence of the chicks, the robot followed random
trajectories.  The overall results were statistically significant
(p&lt;0.01)
(Peoc'h, 1988,1995). 
    (b) Researchers collected fifty-four accounts of animals who
returned
to their owners, sometimes over colossal distances.  These instances
were
unexplainable by sensory cues or by homing instincts; the animals often
traveled to places they had never been.  These instances suggest some
form
of extended awareness (Dossey, 1989, p. 112; Rhine and Feather, 1962). 
<p>EXPLAINABLE BY SUGGESTION? 
 The distant effects of intentionality suggested herein cannot easily be
explained by placebo-type influences such as suggestion and expectation.
These studies are generally double-blind in design.  Moreover, most of
the
studies in this field examine the distant effects of intentionality not
on
other humans but on  lower organisms (bacteria, yeast, fungi), cells
(red
blood cells or other types of tissue), plants (germinating seeds,
growing
seedlings), rats, and mice. These organisms are assumed to be immune to
the
effects of suggestion and expectation, and they presumably do not think
positively (Dossey, 1993).   
<p>NONLOCAL MODELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
  These effects cannot be accommodated by conventional models of
consciousness, which generally assume that consciousness is either an
emergent property of the brain or is identical with it.  All such models
are local  in nature -- i.e., they assume that consciousness and its
effects are localized to specific points in space (brains, bodies) and
time
(the present moment).  Distant effects of intentionality are prohibited
by
such models.  If the above phenomena are to be accommodated, our local
models of the mind may have to yield to some type of model that is
nonlocal
 (Dossey 1989, pp. 1-11).  Such a model would not localize or restrict
consciousness spatiotemporally.  
<p>ADVANTAGES OF A NONLOCAL MODEL 
A nonlocal model of consciousness has several advantages.   
*  Such a model would be comprehensive.  It would accommodate anomalous
observations that do not fit within the current local models of the
mind-brain relationship.   
*  Suggestions that consciousness is spatiotemporally extended are not
new
within science.  For example, such proposals were advanced by Nobelist
Erwin Schrödinger, one of the patriarchs of modern physics, as well as
by
the famous logician-mathematician Kurt Gödel (Dossey, 1989, p. 125 ff).
<p>*  A host of distant manifestations of consciousness have arisen in
other
fields of research, not mentioned here, which also require a nonlocal
model
of consciousness for their explanation (Jahn and Dunne, 1987; Radin and
Nelson, 1989; Radin, 1997a).    
*  Nonlocal events have repeatedly been demonstrated experimentally
within
quantum physics, our most accurate science, for over two decades
(Herbert
,1987, 1993).  Mind-body theorists are therefore not being asked to
&quot;invent&quot; nonlocality.   While the philosophical ramifications of quantum
nonlocality are unclear, the experimental findings appear to be no
longer
in doubt.  The fact that physicists are free to contemplate nonlocality
surely makes it more permissible for mind-body theorists to do the same.
<p>Cautions, however, are in order.   It is currently unknown whether or
not
quantum nonlocality has any relationship whatever to the nonlocal events
observed at the level of the mind, such as the distant effects of
intentionality.   Nobel physicist Brian Josephson has proposed that
consciousness-mediated events represent a form of &quot;biological
utilization&quot;
of quantum nonlocality, and that the nonlocality observed in the
subatomic
domain will eventually explain nonlocal events at the macroscopic, molar
levels of life (Josephson and Pallikara-Villas, 1991).  This suggestion
remains unproved. 
*  Respected scholars in various fields - mathematics, physics, biology,
and the cognitive sciences - including Nobelists, are offering theories
that fully permit nonlocal manifestations of consciousness such as those
seen in intercessory prayer  (Dossey, 1997).  As an example,
mathematician
David J. Chalmers has advanced the idea that consciousness is
fundamental
in the universe, perhaps on a par  with matter and energy (Chalmers,
1995a,
1995b).  Chalmers' view is widely considered to be the most fertile
hypothesis currently circulating in the field of consciousness studies.
<p>Chalmers cites a recent proposal along the same lines by Nobel physicist
Steven Weinberg, who suggests that consciousness may be subject to
physical
laws all its own, which a complete &quot;theory of everything&quot; may have to
recognize (Chalmers, 1995).  While not demonstrating that the effects of
distant intentionality actually exist, these proposals are cordial to
the
possibility and permit the above data to be taken seriously.   
British mathematician C. J. S. Clarke has also offered a sophisticated
nonlocal theory of consciousness, which similarly regards consciousness
as
infinite in space and time (Clarke, 1995).  Clarke's theory is anchored
in
an approach in mathematics known as quantum logic.  These are only two
among a score of provocative ideas about the possible nonlocal nature of
the mind (Dossey,  1997). These hypotheses are important because they
elevate the level of plausibility of intercessory prayer and distant
healing. 
<p>THE MYSTYERY OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
Those who consider the distant effects of prayer to be implausible might
be
reminded that  the origins of consciousness and its relationship to the
brain and body are a mystery. Several outstanding scholars have
emphasized
our appalling ignorance about these matters. John Searle, one of the
most
distinguished philosophers in the field of consciousness, has said, &quot;At
our
present state of the investigation of consciousness, we don't know  how
it
works and we need to try all kinds of different ideas&quot; (Searle, 1995).
Philosopher Jerry A.  Fodor has observed, &quot;Nobody has the  slightest
idea
how anything material could be conscious.  Nobody even knows what it
would
be like to have the slightest idea about how anything material could be
conscious.  So much for the philosophy of consciousness&quot; (Fodor, 1992).
Recently Sir John Maddox, former editor of Nature, soberly stated, &quot;The
catalogue of our ignorance must...include the understanding of the human
brain....  What consciousness consists of...is...a puzzle.  Despite the
marvelous success of neuroscience in the past century..., we seem as far
away from understanding...as we were a century ago....The most important
discoveries of the next 50 years are likely to be ones of which we
cannot
now even conceive&quot;  (Maddox, 1999). If these observers are anywhere near
the truth, we should be hesitant in declaring emphatically what the mind
can and cannot do.  
 
THE FUTURE 
One offers proposals such as these with hesitation, realizing in advance
their extraordinary capacity to evoke not just skepticism but cynicism
and
derision as well.   A response to the commonest criticisms of nonlocal
manifestations of consciousness can be found elsewhere (Dossey, 1995,
1998;
Honorton, 1993; Radin, 1997, pp 205-227).    
However, the question is really not whether  our current model of the
mind-brain-body relationship will change, but what the new model will
be.
The prediction from this quarter is that future visions of consciousness
will be nonlocal in nature and will transform modern healthcare (Dossey,
1999).  Nonlocal models will not do away with local formulations.  They
will subsume, not exclude, them, just as the more comprehensive
quantum-relativistic views in physics did not eradicate Newtonian
concepts,
which remain extraordinarily useful.    
We should acknowledge, however, that nonlocality is not an &quot;explanation&quot;
for the distant effects of intentionality.  No one, including
physicists,
understands how nonlocal events take place, although many suggestions
have
been put forward.  These are often based in information theory (Rubik,
1995).  A novel hypothesis that relies on the quantum vacuum and zero
point
fields has recently been advanced by systems theorist Ervin Laszlo
(Laszlo,
1995). 
Some insist that we delay combining prayer with the use of drugs and
surgical procedures in our hospitals and clinics until we have more
evidence of prayer's effectiveness.  Certainly further investigation of
intercessory prayer is warranted, but we need not wait until all the
answers are in before employing prayer adjunctively.  This view is
represented by Lancet  editor Richard Horton in his &quot;Precautionary
Principle&quot; (Horton, 1998). Horton states, &quot;We must act on facts and on
the
most accurate interpretation of them, using the best information.  That
does not mean that we must sit back until we have 100 percent evidence
about everything.  When the...health of the individual is at stake...we
should be prepared to take action to diminish those risks even when the
scientific knowledge is not conclusive.&quot;   
Skeptics of prayer are plentiful, of course, and skepticism should be
encouraged in any area of science.  However, skepticism can shade into a
type of dogmatic materialism that excludes intercessory prayer in
principle, as when Newton's colleagues condemned universal gravity as
occult nonsense without weighing the evidence (Mills, 1996).   Both true
believers and committed disbelievers in intercessory prayer might heed
the
view of mathematical physicist and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead,
who
co-authored Principia Mathematica with Bertrand Russell (Whitehead,
1948): 
<p>The Universe is vast.  Nothing is more curious than the self-satisfied
dogmatism with which mankind at each period of its history cherishes the
delusion of the finality of its existing modes of knowledge.  Sceptics
and
believers are all alike.  At this moment scientists and sceptics are the
leading dogmatists.  Advance in detail is admitted:  fundamental novelty
is
barred.  This dogmatic common sense is the death of philosophical
adventure.  The Universe is vast.

<p>Meta-analyses of healing studies
Abbot, Neil C, Healing as a therapy for human disease: a systematic
review,
Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 2000, 6(2), 159-169.
    This meta-analysis covers 59 randomized controlled studies,
(including
10 dissertation abstracts and 5 pilot studies) of healing in humans up
to
the year 2000. Of 22 fully reported trials, 10 suggested significant
effects. There were 8 studies rated as methodologically sound, of which
5
showed significant effects. The heterogeneity of the studies precluded a
meta-analysis. Small sample sizes in the 15 studies in the dissertations
and pilot group may have contributed to the lack of significant effects
in
11 of them.
     The inclusion of the the abstracts and pilot studies weakens this
analysis.
Astin, John A/ Harkness, Elaine/ Ernst, Edzard, The efficacy of &quot;distant
healing&quot;: a systematic review of randomized trials, Annals of Internal
Medicine 2000, 132, 903-910.
    <a href="http://www.acponline.org/journals/annals/06jun00/astin.htm">http://www.acponline.org/journals/annals/06jun00/astin.htm</a> 
    John Astin, assistant professor at the University of Maryland
Medical
School, Edzard Ernst, Chairman of the Department of Complementary
Therapies
at the University of Exeter in England, and Elaine Harkness, reviewed 23
studies: 5 with prayer healing, 11 with non-contact Therapeutic Touch,
and
7 miscellaneous distant healing approaches. A positive effect was found
in
57 percent of these.
    The study is a bit peculiar in including non-contact Therapeutic
Touch
as distant healing, but within the study this category is analyzed
separately.
    Overall, for the 16 trials with double blinds, the average effect
size
was 0.40 (p &lt; .001). For 10 TT studies meeting their selection criteria,
the average effect size was 0.63 (p &lt; .003). For the prayer studies the
effect size was 0.25 (p &lt; .009). For the &quot;other&quot; studies the average
effect
size was 0.38 (p &lt; .073).
    The authors conclude that &quot;the evidence thus far warrants further
study.&quot;
    This is an acknowledgment (in research reviewers' terminology) that
the
evidence has merit.
    A second acknowledgment was published in the New York Times, op-ed
page, June 6, 2000, in the column &quot;Vital Signs&quot; by Eric Nagourney,
titled,
&quot;A cautious nod to &quot;Distance Healing.&quot; 
Previously, the New York Times was reluctant to acknowledge healing
research as valid.
<p>Braud, William and Schlitz, Marilyn. A methodology for the objective
study
of transpersonal imagery, Journal of Scientific Exploration 1989, 3(1),
43-63.
    This meta-analysis focuses on electrodermal activity (EDA), a
measure
of skin resistance that reflects states of tension. Healers have been
able
to selectively lower and raise EDA, aided by feedback from a meter
attached
to the healee's skin.
    In a series of studies by William Braud and Marilyn Schlitz there
were
323 sessions with 4 experimenters, 62 influencers and 271 subjects. Of
the
15 studies, 6, (40 per cent) produced significant results. Of the 323
sessions, 57 percent were successful 
(p = .000023). That is, such results could have occurred by chance only
twenty three times in a million. 
Schlitz, Marilyn/ Braud, William, Distant intentionality and healing:
assessing the evidence, Alternative Therapies 1997, 3(6), 62-73.
    Analyzing 19 experiments in which one person sought to influence
another person's electrodermal activity (EDA), they found highly
significant effects (p &lt; .0000007).
Winstead-Fry, Patricia/ Kijek, Jean, An integrative review and
meta-analysis of Therapeutic Touch research, Alternative Therapies 1999,
5(6) 59-67.
    Out of 29 dissertation and research studies that addressed questions
of
efficacy, 19 showed at least partial support for the research
hypothesis.
The other 10 rejected the hypotheses. 
    Deficiencies in reporting details of the studies make it very
difficult
to compare studies. A moderate combined effect size was found (0.39) in
the
13 studies that included means and standard deviations for treatment and
control groups (p &lt; .001).
