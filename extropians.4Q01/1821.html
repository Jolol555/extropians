<em>&gt; Incorrect.  The digital age has produced value carrying media
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This greatly changes the old assumption of physical embodiments
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual acheivements that stand somewhere in between books

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional sense.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps property is a loaded term. I should have used the term 'goods'
<br>
instead-- nonrival and nonexcludable goods. This would include goods
<br>
with no physical embodiment, and goods that have spillover benefits.
<br>
I agree heartily that new technology has fostered new ways of thinking
<br>
and entirely new classes of goods.
<br>
<p>All I'm saying is that nonrival and nonexcludable goods are something
<br>
society has encountered before-- hence the lighthouse analogy.
<br>
Lighthouses exist, are rarely controversial, and the people who build
<br>
them get compensated for their troubles, though of course it's not by
<br>
charging the end-users a 'photon fee'. Photons emanting from a
<br>
lighthouse and MP3s zipping through the internet both lack physical
<br>
embodiments, are nonrival, and nonexcludable. The difference is that
<br>
lighthouses have started out as nonrival and nonexcludable. Intellectual
<br>
works started out as rival and excludable, publishers got rich off
<br>
this fact and became a powerful entrenched interest. Now intellectual
<br>
works are suddenly nonrival and nonexcludable, and the ground is being
<br>
ripped out from under the feet of this entrenched interest. They
<br>
won't go quietly, because entrenched interests never do.
<br>
<p>On the bright side, here is proof that even CEOs of multibillion
<br>
publishing empires can sometimes get completely blindsided by the
<br>
forces of technology and history while little disenfranchised you can
<br>
sometimes outguess them.
<br>
<p>Which is why I don't believe in strong conspiracy theory. Just the
<br>
weak one every now and then. But that's another post I suppose.
