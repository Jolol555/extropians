<p>
One or two people have written me asking how the attempt to raise money
<br>
to help James Swayze get a suspension is going.  Well, to date, the James
<br>
Swayze Fund has gotten about $7000 in hard contributions.  As most
<br>
readers here know, Robert Ettinger of CI has pledged to personally pay
<br>
the remaining amount to guarantee a suspension for James, provided at
<br>
least $20,000 can be raised.  So, thus far, we've over one third of the
<br>
way there.
<br>
<p>This is not as much in the way of contributions as we had hoped.  On the
<br>
other hand, all things considered, it is not a bad result either, and
<br>
future prospects look encouraging.
<br>
<p>I say that because the James Swayze Fund has so far had to face four
<br>
problems:
<br>
<p>1.  First, of course, the September Eleven bombings.  That awful
<br>
incident, and the continuing consequences, completed dominated all the
<br>
media, internet included, for several weeks.  Discussion of James
<br>
Swayze's personal situation, and just about everything else, took a back
<br>
seat.  In addition, everyone's attention, donations, and giving went to
<br>
disaster relief organizations like the Red Cross and so on.  That
<br>
attention and those donations were certainly appropriate, but they did
<br>
set publicity and contributions for the Swayze Fund on temporary hold,
<br>
and forced us to look at our fund-raising efforts in terms of a longer
<br>
time-frame.  It's unfortunate to consider that the effects of the bombing
<br>
were such that nearly all its victims died almost immediately and that
<br>
the great amounts of money donated could not save them; whereas James
<br>
Swayze *can* still be saved.  But then that's also a reason for optimism:
<br>
&nbsp;in James' case, there's still a chance to make a difference.
<br>
<p>2.  Prior to Robert Ettinger's announcement, $10,000 was already pledged.
<br>
&nbsp;A number of those previously pledged donations for James did not
<br>
materialize. 
<br>
<p>3.  James himself -- to very much understate things -- is not been in the
<br>
best of health, and has in the past two months had to undergo some rather
<br>
daunting tests and treatments.  That's limited his own ability to take
<br>
part in the effort, by responding to things like questions and
<br>
interviews.
<br>
<p>4.  Lastly, the funding effort to date has so far been restricted to a
<br>
very small number of potential contributors -- specifically, the readers
<br>
of the Cryonet and Extropian lists, and the sci-cryonics newsgroup.
<br>
<p>Given these factors, I think it's fair to say that we've actually done
<br>
rather well in reaching more than a third of our goal.  And what is
<br>
particularly heartening is that some of the factors above are changing,
<br>
and are now moving back in James'  favor.  To be specific:
<br>
<p>1.  The complete domination of the September Eleven incident in the news
<br>
and in the area of donations is easing up a bit.  It's more likely that
<br>
the message about James can get through now, and get a response.
<br>
<p>2.  Simply because some of the earlier pledges have not come in, it
<br>
doesn't mean that they'll never come in.  Those pledging may be a little
<br>
tardy, but -- if you're one of those pledgers, and you're reading this --
<br>
bear in mind that the CI and the Swayze Fund are more than ready to
<br>
accept your donation, and that with Robert Ettinger's announcement there
<br>
is a real liklihood that your pledge will make a difference. There is a
<br>
real fighting chance for James now, so if you've forgotten to send in
<br>
your pledge because you've been caught up in events or in personal
<br>
matters, or have just not been reading Cryonet and missed the
<br>
developments, please:  send your pledge in.
<br>
<p>3.  Though James' health is fragile, he's recovered enough to be able to
<br>
deal with interviews and so on and his active involvement in the process
<br>
will be a definite help.  In addition, CI has set the membership process
<br>
for James in motion by sending James the appropriate forms and so on. 
<br>
Thus, all the paperwork and conditions should be in place by the time
<br>
suspension becomes necessary.  Once the funding is in place, everything
<br>
will be ready.
<br>
<p>4.  CI -- or rather, those people on the CI team that are trying to raise
<br>
funds for James --has decided to try to get James' story out to a larger
<br>
number of people, in hopes of getting contributions from the general
<br>
public.  To that end, we are putting out a set of press releases that
<br>
hopefully will bring in contributions from outside the circle of regular
<br>
Cryonet readers.
<br>
<p>That's how things stand now.
<br>
<p>What can you do to help?
<br>
<p>First and foremost -- donate.  I'm sure we all wish James well, but the
<br>
bottom line is that our wishes won't get James a suspension, and our
<br>
donations will.  Yes, large donations are better than small ones, but we
<br>
ought to remember that if every signed-up cryonics member gave as little
<br>
as ten dollars, that would nearly put us over the top.  Just ten more
<br>
cryonicists pledging a thousand dollars apiece would do the same thing. 
<br>
Through CI, the James Swayze Fund has even arranged to take donations by
<br>
credit card via Paypal at <a href="http://www.paypal.com">http://www.paypal.com</a>.  So contributing doesn't
<br>
mean taking a big bite out your savings:   you can pay off your donation
<br>
by credit card at as easy a pace as you like. 
<br>
<p>The next best thing you can do?  Tell others about James's situation and
<br>
about the Swayze Fund.  The fact is, even most cryonicists and people
<br>
sympathetic to cryonics are not daily readers of Cryonet.  There are
<br>
people are out there who very much sympathize with the idea of cryonics
<br>
and who might be very willing to contribute, but who just don't know
<br>
about James' situation.  Let them know.  Mention it when you see or email
<br>
them, and mention James' web site at <a href="http://www.davidpascal.com/swayze">http://www.davidpascal.com/swayze</a>. 
<br>
Just casually letting people know doesn't cost anything and isn't very
<br>
hard to do -- but it might just get through to those one or two people
<br>
whose contribution could get us over the finish line.  
<br>
<p>In this connection, I'd especially like to thank Charles Platt, for being
<br>
good enough to allow me to mention the James Swayze Fund in his Alcor
<br>
Forum newsletter, and Rick Potvin, for letting me do so on his online
<br>
Alcor forum.  I think this is a good example of cryonicists being able to
<br>
pull together in a good cause, and also a good example of something that
<br>
James Swayze has brought to the cryonics community:  a reminder that we
<br>
*are* a community, and that we *can* work together to help one another. 
<br>
Helping James Swayze may not only benefit James, but demonstrate that the
<br>
cryonics community is willing to stand together and care for its own; and
<br>
that may very well increase all our chances.
