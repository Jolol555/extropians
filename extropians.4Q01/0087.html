Spike writes, regarding firing shots into the air:
<br>
<em>&gt; In the event of such an attack, I figure a five hundred proles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squeeze off 10 rounds each to accumulate about a 50% chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a score, so we should expect about 5 deaths and 10 injuries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by falling bullets per shootfest.  Let us hope it never comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<p>According to <a href="http://home.sprynet.com/~frfrog/miscella.htm">http://home.sprynet.com/~frfrog/miscella.htm</a>:
<br>
<p>: Hatcher describes one experiment with the 150gr M2 Ball bullet fired
<br>
: vertically. When it came back from vertical (round trip time was about
<br>
: 42.9 seconds) it left only a 1/16 inch dent in a soft pine board that it
<br>
: happened to hit. (Not exactly what it would do at 2700f/s, eh?) Based
<br>
: upon this and similar tests Hatcher concluded that the impact velocity
<br>
: was about 300 f/s, which from additional testing appears to be the
<br>
: terminal velocity (the maximum free fall velocity which is limited by
<br>
: air drag on the body in question) of that bullet falling from any height
<br>
: in the atmosphere. (If I remember correctly from my limited parachuting
<br>
: experience the terminal velocity of a falling person is somewhere around
<br>
: 130 mph or about 200 f/s.)
<br>
<p>The article goes on to say that this is fast enough to penetrate the
<br>
skin and potentially cause serious injury.  But I doubt that you would
<br>
kill someone hitting them on the top of the head with a bullet going
<br>
only this fast.
