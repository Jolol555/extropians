</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe you have a persuasive, argument there.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you.  I'll continue to research the issue to make sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My only contention was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the 80's the general citizenry was aware of the previous 2 oil
</em><br>
shocks
<br>
<em>&gt; from OPEC, and was better prepared psychologically to deal with it.
</em><br>
<p>I think there was a lot more going on than that.  First, the previous
<br>
oil shocks led to changes in the whole oil market.  There was a lot of
<br>
exploration and efficiency increasing moves in the 1970s.  I.e., when
<br>
the price of oil goes up, it makes new exploration and inefficient wells
<br>
suddenly much more profitable.  Second, there was deregulation in the
<br>
late 1970s, early 1980s, including the removal of price fixing.  This
<br>
allowed the oild markets to work much more efficiently.  Third, the
<br>
entire network of futures markets became much more global and faster
<br>
responding just due to deregulation there and increasing technology and
<br>
experience in these areas.  (I mention &quot;experience&quot; because as people
<br>
become more experienced with certain types of coordination and market
<br>
instruments, they are able to apply these more quickly and with less
<br>
consternation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation that spent their childhood in the 1980's rather then the
</em><br>
70's are
<br>
<em>&gt; less focused on energy as an economic issue, rather then a purely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental issue.
</em><br>
<p>Some of this is, no doubt, true, but it doesn't explain the whole
<br>
picture.  See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would contant this has some impact on such things as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panic buying, and irrationality of the marketplace, discussed in our
</em><br>
previous
<br>
<em>&gt; posts. On the evening of 9-11, gasoline was selling to record crowds
</em><br>
for 5.00
<br>
<em>&gt; per gallon at some fuel stations in Ohio. Up the road it was going for
</em><br>
1.49 a
<br>
<em>&gt; gallon, and stayed at that price before slowly falling.
</em><br>
<p>Notably, this was only very short term.  I'm just glad some idiots in
<br>
government didn't further regulate the gasoline markets.  If they had,
<br>
we would have had a situation that was isolated and short lived
<br>
determining a policy that would probably outlive all the people in the
<br>
life extension movement.:/
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Argentina is now facing such decisions now and if they follow the
</em><br>
Russion
<br>
<em>&gt; 1998 model, their economy should recover, by doing something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international trade advocates would demurr--buying and selling
</em><br>
domestic
<br>
<em>&gt; products and services. Because thet now do this, rather then rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international trade to revive their economy, the Russians are
</em><br>
experiencing a
<br>
<em>&gt; double-digit growth spurt.
</em><br>
<p>Argentina is an example of the global risk externalization problem
<br>
(thanks to the IMF -- even the _New York Times_ seems to understand
<br>
this, reading their online edition -- and the Fed) as well inflation.
<br>
Without these, I doubt Argentina's economy would be imploding.  It might
<br>
not be an economic powerhouse, but it certainly wouldn't be a basket
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
