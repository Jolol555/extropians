Smigrodzki, Rafal wrote,

<em>&gt; In response to Harvey Newstrom:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a code where I use a document (extropians-digestV6#269), and
</em><br>
arbitrarily
<br>
<em>&gt; choose the word Dejanews in your message as the starting point. I counted
</em><br>
all
<br>
<em>&gt; the characters till I found an occurrence of the first letter of my
</em><br>
intended
<br>
<em>&gt; message - this is the first number in my message. Then again I counted
</em><br>
characters
<br>
<em>&gt; until the second letter of my message occurred, and so forth. If I use the
</em><br>
document
<br>
<em>&gt; only once, you cannot use any statistical method to find the letters. You
</em><br>
have to
<br>
<em>&gt; know at least the document I am using, then with much trial and error you
</em><br>
might
<br>
<em>&gt; find the arbitrary starting point and decode the message.
</em><br>
<p>So apparently your message was only a few characters long.  I did not guess
<br>
it was that short, and was indeed guessing that you were counting words
<br>
instead of characters.  This is a pretty good method, but you should be
<br>
aware that such codes were common during World War II.  They were discarded
<br>
because better security can be found with strong encryption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, suppose you used the brute force approach of searching everything on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; net and trying which one fits - this message was too short to decode with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainty - you would find thousands of documents yielding reasonable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally irrelevant decryptions.
</em><br>
<p>Very true.  Extremely short codes are hard to decrypt because they could be
<br>
anything.  A coded message of one character &quot;X&quot; could be decrypted to any
<br>
letter, and we still wouldn't know what it meant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you might stumble on the right one but you wouldn't know it and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't claim your million dollars if you had a whole zip disk full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of possible meaning for my message.  If I wanted to send a longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message, such that it would be unlikely to produce random but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful decryptions, I would of course never use a codebook
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to to potential eavesdroppers - I would personally deliver
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a CD-ROM full of digitized pictures form my wedding to the intended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recipients and in that case neither statistics, nor brute-force net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search would help you.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this method is much more secure than the simpler version that I had
<br>
guessed you were using.  You might be recreating a weak type of one-time
<br>
pad.  A good one-time pad is uncrackable, but it requires the pad to be
<br>
truly random.  Your pad is English text which is less than random, and you
<br>
are counting rather than XORing bits.  Still, you are very close to
<br>
re-inventing a known secure method.  See
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://pubweb.nfr.net/~mjr/pubs/otpfaq/">http://pubweb.nfr.net/~mjr/pubs/otpfaq/</a>&gt; for a description of strong
<br>
one-time pads.  You will see some similarities with what you have developed.
