<p>The Unforeseen Disruption of Moving Ahead
<br>
<p>December 22, 2001 
<br>
<p>By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN
<br>
<p>It is lonely at the top, but it also seems secure. The view
<br>
is intoxicating. Every potential challenge is visible. The
<br>
perch seems to guarantee invulnerability. 
<br>
<p>But then, from an unexpected direction, comes an almost
<br>
insignificant challenge, one that at first can seem a minor
<br>
annoyance, hardly worth concentrated attention. And then
<br>
unexpectedly the leader is toppled. 
<br>
<p>This pattern of military confrontation is a model that has
<br>
been increasingly used to describe progress in the worlds
<br>
of business and technology; its emphasis on
<br>
unpredictability, on the dangers of assault from below and
<br>
on the possibly permanent disruption that results have
<br>
undermined many preconceptions about the course of
<br>
innovation and change. 
<br>
<p>The Internet-business bubble, for example, was supported by
<br>
claims that smaller companies without the prospects of
<br>
profits had the power to disrupt &quot;bricks and mortar&quot;
<br>
empires. The Internet itself was also hailed by its
<br>
acolytes in the early 1990's, when it still had minor cult
<br>
status, as a disruptive force with revolutionary
<br>
implications that had the ability not just to transform
<br>
society but also to alter the nature of human
<br>
consciousness. 
<br>
<p>Economists and historians, though, have been taking
<br>
low-level disruption seriously for decades. The economist
<br>
Joseph Schumpeter coined the term creative destruction to
<br>
explain how advances in technology, often small ones, can
<br>
overturn the powers of established companies. More
<br>
recently, Clayton M. Christensen, a professor of business
<br>
administration at the Harvard Business School, argued in
<br>
his 1997 book, &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma,&quot; that disruptive
<br>
innovation is unavoidable and almost always unforeseen. He
<br>
notes that such disruption becomes all the more effective
<br>
when a dominant company is best managed, when it takes care
<br>
of its work force, focuses clearly on the marketplace and
<br>
works to produce the highest profits. That is when it is
<br>
least likely to give credence to a seemingly insignificant
<br>
challenge. Before long, it is too late and the old
<br>
conditions may never return. 
<br>
<p>Mr. Christensen gives several detailed examples of this
<br>
process, including the overturn of Sears, which pioneered
<br>
chain stores and catalog marketing, by once-insignificant
<br>
discount retailers. Other examples are legion. Kodak and
<br>
Xerox faltered because of the unanticipated powers of
<br>
digital reproduction. I.B.M. was once considered so
<br>
unassailable that in the early 1980's it was the object of
<br>
a two-year antitrust investigation by the Justice
<br>
Department; it has since lost power and prestige to
<br>
companies like Microsoft - itself a classic example of a
<br>
onetime small disrupter whose dominance could not have been
<br>
imagined, let alone an antitrust case challenging that
<br>
dominance. 
<br>
<p>This sort of disruption from below might seem to be limited
<br>
to capitalist economies, but it also seems common to many
<br>
cultural transformations. Small innovations can end up
<br>
having large consequences. The stirrup has been credited
<br>
with transforming the nature of war. And as the historian
<br>
David S. Landes pointed out in &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of
<br>
Nations,&quot; the invention of eyeglasses may have transformed
<br>
the West: glasses extended the work life of artisans,
<br>
scientists and inventors and allowed more attention to
<br>
finely detailed machine work. 
<br>
<p>Almost by definition, the impact of disruption comes as a
<br>
surprise. An innovation may have one purpose, but its
<br>
ripple effects are unpredictable, which is one reason an
<br>
established power can miss the implications. A few years
<br>
ago the historian Edward Tenner argued in &quot;Why Things Bite
<br>
Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended
<br>
Consequences&quot; that for every technological action, there is
<br>
an equal, opposite and unpredicted reaction: technology's
<br>
revenge. That revenge can show up even in paradoxical ways:
<br>
the invention of a safer football helmet actually led to
<br>
increased injuries because the new helmets increased the
<br>
game's aggressive possibilities. 
<br>
<p>The history of technology is riddled with distorted
<br>
predictions and unexpected consequences. The telegraph, it
<br>
was believed, would create stronger communal bonds; instead
<br>
it permitted greater dispersion. The airplane, it was
<br>
guessed, would make the world smaller, leading to a new era
<br>
of peace; instead it became an instrument of war. Thomas A.
<br>
Edison envisioned the phonograph's being used primarily for
<br>
transcribing business transactions. Many contemporary
<br>
imaginings of the future seem just as unlikely. Michael
<br>
Dertouzos, who directed the Laboratory for Computer Science
<br>
at M.I.T., seriously suggested that later in this century
<br>
people would dress themselves by asking their &quot;bedroom
<br>
monitor&quot; to put together a suitable outfit. 
<br>
<p>Innovation and change, then, occur in a world so complex
<br>
that the unexpected must always be expected. 
<br>
<p>Twenty-five years ago no one predicted the influence of the
<br>
fax, the VCR and the desktop computer. Most communications
<br>
and software companies recognize that eventually the
<br>
telephone, television and the Internet will be closely
<br>
bound; contemporary notions of the computer will seem
<br>
grossly limited. 
<br>
<p>Such may be the stumbling course of all progress and
<br>
accomplishment. The current recession, the plunge in
<br>
venture-capital spending and the traumas facing many
<br>
companies are bound to slow innovation, leading to
<br>
consolidation and retrenchment. But this shift is also
<br>
bound to be temporary, for innovation occurs in waves. And
<br>
the pace of technological change has been particularly
<br>
breathless during the last century, and even more
<br>
particularly, it seems, in the United States. For
<br>
technological disruption does not just affect culture but
<br>
is also affected by it. It flourishes in certain
<br>
environments and flounders in others. 
<br>
<p>Disruption is at least in part an intellectual phenomenon
<br>
in which new ideas arise unconstrained by dominant
<br>
preconceptions. It may be, for example, that the spirit of
<br>
disruption, as outlined in Mr. Christensen's model, was
<br>
latent in the very origins of the United States, helping to
<br>
account for its persistent recurrence here. 
<br>
<p>The United States was itself an invention based on a set of
<br>
disruptive ideas; its Revolution succeeded partly because
<br>
of the strength of those ideas in the face of a seemingly
<br>
immutable power that never expected the attack by inferior
<br>
forces. Those ideas also helped create a society - as
<br>
Alexis de Tocqueville recognized - that cultivated novelty;
<br>
the lack of social hierarchies even allowed individuals to
<br>
remake themselves as Gatsby does in Fitzgerald's novel. 
<br>
<p>In a recent book, &quot;American Literature in a Culture of
<br>
Creative Destruction&quot; by Philip Fisher, a professor of
<br>
literature at Harvard, this spirit is seen as one of the
<br>
guiding themes of American literature: the &quot;apparent
<br>
completeness and perfection of the world just as it is now&quot;
<br>
is continually overturned. American culture, with its
<br>
pursuit of novelty and change, provides fertile ground for
<br>
technological disruption. 
<br>
<p>But these patterns of disruption are more complicated than
<br>
they seem. Their consequences are often unseen by their
<br>
creators as well as by those being displaced. In technology
<br>
they can lead to periods of confusion in which helpful
<br>
standards are dismantled. In culture, valuable knowledge
<br>
may end up being discarded. Political disruption can become
<br>
bloody, leading to power that ruthlessly quashes any hint
<br>
of future upheaval. 
<br>
<p>There have even been serious challenges to disruption
<br>
itself, seeking to eliminate it if possible. In business,
<br>
this is one reason monopoly power is viewed with such
<br>
suspicion; it attempts to eliminate all forms of
<br>
disruption. In cultural life, in the face of the Industrial
<br>
Revolution, romantics and Luddites rejected the pace of
<br>
social change in favor of the &quot;natural,&quot; treating nature as
<br>
if it were free of disruption. And in the face of Western
<br>
modernity, with multiplying social and cultural
<br>
disruptions, full- scale attacks have unfolded. 
<br>
<p>Destructive innovation, then, is full of ambiguities,
<br>
dangers and unpredictable consequences. But even during
<br>
these times of economic caution, its complexity and its
<br>
potency demand new strategies, Mr. Christensen shows, for
<br>
disruption can never be avoided or fully eliminated.
