<p>
Controversial author David Brin has a new novel out, Kiln People, which
<br>
sounds like it may include some of our favorite themes.  here is what
<br>
he has to say about it at his web site, www.kithrup.com/brin:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of my new novel -- the most original thing I've done in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years -- is Kiln People, which will be published by Tor Books in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 2002.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the notion of golems-- temporary clay people (not clones!) --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and now imagine a near future when everybody can make them. Using
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a &quot;home copier&quot; you ditto your memories -- perhaps even a genuine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imprint of your soul -- and off goes the duplicate to run your errands,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attend your classes, or do all the drudgery work. Then, at day's end,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you download the golem's memories.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen of this near future, you've duplicated yourself a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zillion times and take it for granted, sometimes being the original,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes the copy. You live your life in parallel, sending expensive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;study golems&quot; to the library while cheap models clean the house
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your real body works out at the gym. Two thirds of the Earth's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;population consists of temporaries made of clay. People seem to have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even adjusted to this new way of life, until....
<br>
<p>Sounds like a fascinating concept.  Note that there is no question which
<br>
is the copy and which is the original, since the copy is made of clay.
<br>
Nevertheless since the golem's memories are merged back into the original,
<br>
people apparently treat copies with the same respect as originals.  Your
<br>
own memories include episodes where you were copy as well as original,
<br>
and it seems that the golem memories seem just as real as the flesh ones.
<br>
<p>I don't know about making copies to clean the house.  I guess somebody's
<br>
got to do the job, but the copies who get stuck with it wouldn't be
<br>
too happy.
<br>
