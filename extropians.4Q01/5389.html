HOD LIPSON AND JORDAN B. POLLACK
<br>
Biological life is in control of its own means of reproduction, which
<br>
generally involves complex, autocatalysing chemical reactions. But this
<br>
autonomy of design and manufacture has not yet been realized artificially.
<br>
Robots are still laboriously designed and constructed by teams of human
<br>
engineers, usually at considerable expense. Few robots are available because
<br>
these costs must be absorbed through mass production, which is justified only
<br>
for toys, weapons and industrial systems such as automatic teller machines.
<br>
Here we report the results of a combined computational and experimental
<br>
approach in which simple electromechanical systems are evolved through
<br>
simulations from basic building blocks (bars, actuators and artificial
<br>
neurons); the 'fittest' machines (defined by their locomotive ability) are
<br>
then fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology. We thus
<br>
achieve autonomy of design and construction using evolution in a 'limited
<br>
universe' physical simulation coupled to automatic fabrication.
<br>
In the field of artificial life, 'life as it could be' is examined on the
<br>
basis of understanding the principles, and simulating the mechanisms, of real
<br>
biological forms. Just as aeroplanes use the same principles as birds, but
<br>
have fixed wings, artificial lifeforms may share the same principles, but not
<br>
the same implementation in chemistry. Stored energy, autonomous movement, and
<br>
even animal communication are replicated in toys using batteries, motors and
<br>
computer chips.
<br>
Our central claim is that to realize artificial life, full autonomy must be
<br>
attained not only at the level of power and behaviour (the goal of robotics,
<br>
today5), but also at the levels of design and fabrication. Only then can we
<br>
expect synthetic creatures to sustain their own evolution. We thus seek
<br>
automatically designed and constructed physical artefacts that are functional
<br>
in the real world, diverse in architecture (possibly each slightly different),
<br>
and automatically producible with short turnaround time, at low cost and in
<br>
large quantities. So far these requirements have not been met.
