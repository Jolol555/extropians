Scerir observed:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Summing up: there is _some_ possibility that a quantum net
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might exist, routing (and storing) superluminal &quot;signals&quot; or 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;influences&quot;. Or (maybe) not?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-s.  &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>Please consider and dismiss, if desired, these two papers by theorist P.A. 
<br>
Zizzi, from the University di Padova, Dipartimento di Astronomia. I say this 
<br>
because his works seem related to Tom Stonier's (whom I was unaware of tell I 
<br>
read your posts). 
<br>
<p><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/ftp/gr-qc/papers/0103/0103002.pdf">http://xxx.lanl.gov/ftp/gr-qc/papers/0103/0103002.pdf</a>
<br>
&quot;The Early Universe as a Quantum Growing Network&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/ftp/gr-qc/papers/0110/0110122.pdf">http://xxx.lanl.gov/ftp/gr-qc/papers/0110/0110122.pdf</a>
<br>
&quot;Ultimate Internets&quot;
<br>
<p>Scerir continues...
<br>
&lt;&lt;&quot;An infon&quot; - he writes - &quot;is a photon whose wavelength has been
<br>
stretched to infinity&quot;, and conversely, &quot;a photon is an infon travelling
<br>
at the speed of light&quot;, and also &quot;at velocities other than c, a quantum
<br>
of energy becomes converted into a quantum of information - an infon&quot;.
<br>
<p>Finally Stonier thinks that &quot;the hole left in an atomic shell by a lost
<br>
electron, consitutes a particulate form of information, i.e., an infon&quot;,
<br>
and that &quot;To fermions and bosons, therefore, we need to add a third
<br>
class of particles - infons. The first two represent the particulate
<br>
manifestation of matter and energy. Infons represent the particulate
<br>
manifestation of information; they include particles such as phonons,
<br>
excitons, and the holes left in atomic shells by ejected electrons.&quot;
<br>
<p>What can I say ... that's terrible, imo.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If I was to go even farther then Stonier's conjecture, and ask: Is it 
<br>
probable that perhaps all data about the universe, including such preposte
<br>
rous, things, as a dog relieving himself on a street in Oslo, Norway in 1968; 
<br>
as well as the creation of the Great Attractor, 10 billion years ago, be 
<br>
'intellectually viable' as an implication of Stonier's hypothesis?
<br>
<p>Again, this question may call for strong drink or prozac, to even ponder. :-(
