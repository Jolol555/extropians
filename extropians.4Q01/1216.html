Brian D Williams:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                      The Mystery of Capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Why capitalism triumphs in the west and fails everywhere else.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                         Hernando De Soto
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                        ISBN 0-465-01614-6
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                            U.S. $27.50
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a fascinating book and I would highly recommend it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone interested in either free markets or seriously interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping out disadvantaged countries/peoples.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm sorry that you didn't make it the Extro conference this year,
<br>
Brian.  You would have seen Mark Miller highlight this book in his
<br>
presentation.  What may or may not have been obvious in his talk is
<br>
that Mark's present focus of his work is to implement some of the
<br>
aspects from this book (as well as his own related ideas).
<br>
<p>It is difficult for libertarians to tell people 10 years after the
<br>
&quot;Fall of Communism&quot; why those people's (in former communist countries)
<br>
lives are not significantly better now. For me personally it's sad,
<br>
since I was one of those who used to tell people that as soon as the
<br>
communists disappeared, and free market mechanisms took hold, then
<br>
their economic lives would be much better (I think that you know that
<br>
I hold both an American and a Latvian passport). Mark has convinced me
<br>
now that this book can explain some important reasons why those
<br>
people's lives are not signficantly better, as well as what can be
<br>
done to change that situation. It certainly is a cause to be
<br>
passionate about!
<br>
<p>No, I haven't read this book yet, but it's been on my reading list
<br>
in-queue since Mark spent some time talking about it with me in June,
<br>
and I'm looking forward to it.
<br>
<p>BTW, we need to get Mark Miller and Hernando De Soto together. They
<br>
have not met each other yet.
<br>
