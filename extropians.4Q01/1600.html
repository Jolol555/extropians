Wow! A wonderful, insightful post Eliezer.

<p><em>&gt;I think that the age of downloading will probably reduce the total amount

</em><br>
<em>&gt;who have grown up expecting payment.
</em><br>
<p>While I agree that it may reduce the total amount of $$ going to artists, I 
<br>
don't think it necessarily entails a lowering of standards. Many of my 
<br>
musician and artist friends have found that they can live for their art 
<br>
without the requirement of earning much from it. Some of the musicians I 
<br>
know make their money from live performances and give away the rest.
<br>
<p>I was at an alternative art festival recently where many artists and 
<br>
musicians were of the opinion that they had little to gain from the 
<br>
standard star-maker industry anyway so the give-it-away model has little 
<br>
adverse effect on them, and a very positive effect of widening their 
<br>
audience way beyond what they could ever have afforded before. Advertising 
<br>
and distribution have traditionally been horrendously expensive... suddenly 
<br>
that has changed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Now [music is] an informational good and can be copied....
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Each additional download creates wealth, because information is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinitely duplicable good...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Whether money gets transferred, and where it goes, is almost a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;side issue compared to downloading; money is conserved, but downloading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite...  each additional download creates new wealth; money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't care whose hands it's in because that doesn't create wealth one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way or the other.
</em><br>
<p>Your point about money having a static value whereas copied information 
<br>
increases wealth is a very important one. I had never thought about it in 
<br>
quite the way you put it in this post. It makes me wonder if perhaps money 
<br>
is coming to the end of its usefulness. What would a truly 
<br>
information-based economy look like and how would it work? Interesting stuff.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If tipping infrastructures can break
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the stranglehold of the current power structure, then the choice of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much to pay the middleman will shift from the middleman to the artist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The latter effect will reduce the amount paid to middlemen - and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;former effect will reduce the total amount paid to artists, at least on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;per-work basis; even if people are willing to spend the same total amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as before, cheap artists and free artists will still tend to drive out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive artists.
</em><br>
<p>Your point about tipping is very good. It's a model which is already in 
<br>
place where people give feel-good money to other people even though they're 
<br>
under no compulsion to do so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are various things that can be done about the probable decrease in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artist revenues.  Eliminating middlemen will increase the amount that goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to artists.  For those who are willing to put effort into this, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the most leveraged approach is to create tipping infrastructures, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tips going directly to the artists, despite the screams this will cause by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the RIAA and MPAA.  But in the long run, even that is doomed.  Content
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that doesn't request tips will drive out content that requests tips.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we are seeing the bottom fall out of the middleman market, and I see 
<br>
this as a *Good Thing* -- too many middlemen makes the market very 
<br>
inefficient. However a tipping infrastructure might not be doomed. Free 
<br>
downloads are not necessarily preferred over paid ones. My own personal 
<br>
experience is that I do use shareware and when I am satisfied with it I pay 
<br>
for it. If freeware is superior (and in defiance of market &quot;common sense&quot; 
<br>
it quite often is) then I use it. If the program I need can only be bought 
<br>
then I obtain a cracked copy to test out first. If it is truly suitable 
<br>
then I do buy it. I am not rich... in fact I live pretty-much at or below 
<br>
the poverty line.
<br>
<p>There are many things we do because they are sensible rather than because 
<br>
we'll get busted if we don't. I would be delighted to see an age where 
<br>
being a good citizen is the result of seeing that it makes good sense 
<br>
instead of doing it because you'll get nabbed.
<br>
<p>When I managed Awaba, a virtual world for kids, I didn't impose strict 
<br>
rules, and, unlike many other virtual worlds that had tightly enforced 
<br>
rules, Awaba had very few problems with antisocial behavior. It is 
<br>
interesting that the few that did act disruptively seemed to come from very 
<br>
strict backgrounds, with parents who were in the military (I am thinking 
<br>
particularly of a couple of individuals here). It may just be that they 
<br>
were having trouble adapting to the lack of external constraints, having 
<br>
developed few internal constraints.
<br>
<p>Maybe this is the beginning of a future where the focus is on voluntarily 
<br>
sociable behavior rather than enforced social behavior. I sure hope so.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
