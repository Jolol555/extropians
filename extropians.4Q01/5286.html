<em>&gt; &gt; private nationwide database of gun ownership by violating the medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; privacy rights of private citizens. If your doctor is aware of, or has

<em>&gt; &gt; asked you, your spouse, or your children if there are firearms in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; household, in the past three years, then you are now on this database.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would they need to ask?  In California they took address and

<em>&gt; checked it against driver's license and gave it to the FBI at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun purchase time.  It would be pointless for the docs to also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go snooping.
</em><br>
<p>You do not seem to be aware of what the law actually is. The Insta-check
<br>
system mandated by the Brady Act prohibits the use of such data to
<br>
assemble a national gun registration system. When you purchase a gun,
<br>
your name is checked against a database of those prohibited from purchse
<br>
(felons, domestic abusers, insane, etc). If you are not on the database
<br>
of those who are prohibited, then the record of you being checked is to
<br>
be deleted, with no permanent record that your name was ever queried.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Despite this sort of invasiveness being a 'boundary issue' ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violation of doctor-patient confidentiality, millions of family doctors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and emergency room staffers are engaging in this illegal campaign to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; identify all gun owners in the US. Furthermore, they are advising family
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; members of gun owners of the alleged 'risks' of gun ownership (despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the total lack of training by such practitioners in risk assessment or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; risk management, a lack of certification in the same, and a lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; liability insurance for the same). If, for instance, your wife is told
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by her OB-GYN that your self defense pistol should be kept unloaded and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; locked up in a safe at all times, they are placing themselves in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; position of liability if your lack of ability to access your firearm for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self defense results in injury, death, or other financial losses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know all of this but I still don't think it is a good excuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for comparing the ACLU to terrorists or claiming they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderers.  Why not leave that sort of purple prose to those on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other side of your position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The ACLU will, though, happily defend your doctor against your civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suit in the event you take him/her to court, claiming that the doctor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has a first amendment right to disseminate the lies and propaganda of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the anti-gun movement, that whether the doctor is wrong or not is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immaterial to the doctors intent to help protect the patient from harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (an argument that carries no water in malpractice case law, but would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; play in front of a jury).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as a matter of fact, he does have that right to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever he wants for whatever reason he wants.  Just like I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the right to tell him to mind his own business which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I am paying him for and what he is presumably trained for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really, I have never had a doctor ask me any such questions.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no, he doesn't. You may say it's okay with you, but under the
<br>
standard principles of medical ethics, it isn't. If a medical provider
<br>
advises you of anything, they must have the training and certification
<br>
to show that they a) know what they are talking about, and b) are
<br>
insured for malpractice regarding that. This is why a podiatrist can't
<br>
advise you about AB/GYN issues, and vice versa etc.: They are not
<br>
qualified to have an opinion. They can refer you to someone who is
<br>
qualified, but they cannot give you a medical opinion about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The ACLU is as much a terrorist organization as the al Barakhat money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wiring organization in Somalia is. They may not get their own hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bloody, but they enable the deaths of thousands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That organization is also not terrorist.  Whatever happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarcho-capitalism and especially the cyber version of same?
</em><br>
<p>Al Barakhat has been documented to have funnelled millions of dollars to
<br>
al Qaeda from it's own profits, and is owned by an associate of bin
<br>
Laden.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did everyone decide these great ideas aren't so great if maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some bad people also use them?  BAH! Some committment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom.   Damn hypocritical if you ask me.   And no, wiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money around does not necessarily make you culpable for anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless you explicitly know what the money is for and endorse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  If you say otherwise then you are only a step from saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that ISPs are utterly responsible for every byte of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and intent that goes through their servers.
</em><br>
<p>If you give a part of your profits to, say, fund Timothy McVeigh's
<br>
activities, when you know he is a right wing extremist who advocates the
<br>
killing of people, does that no make you party to the conspiracy?
<br>
<p>Al Barakhat does more than just wire money for others who may or may not
<br>
be legitimate. The fees it charges for such service are used in part to
<br>
fund al Qaeda operations. If they just wired money for anybody,
<br>
terrorist or no, I'd agree with you. But they do not. They fund it from
<br>
their own profits.
