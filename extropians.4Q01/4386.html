<p><em>    &gt;Assertion: Sentience and subjective continuity is reliant on both the

</em><br>
<p>There is something special about the pattern of atoms that make up your
<br>
body but there is absolutely nothing special about the atoms themselves.
<br>
Science can find no difference between one hydrogen atom and another,
<br>
you can swap them and no detectable change in the system, any system,
<br>
can be found.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I lay on a table, a passive scanner determines the precise location of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;every atom in my body, its type, and what neighboring atoms it is bonded to,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;and proceeds to construct a atomic level duplicate of me.  We are both
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;awakened and escorted to separate rooms, the 'copy' is asked if he is able
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;to see what the 'original' (me) sees, the 'copy' reports that he can not.
</em><br>
<p>Well then the person you call &quot;the copy&quot; is no longer a copy of the person
<br>
you call &quot;the original&quot; because now they have different memories of being
<br>
escorted into different rooms.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I lay on a table, a destructive scanning machine determines the precise
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;location of every atom in my body while disrupting the information of the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;previous atom it scanned.  Using the collected information, an atomic level
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;duplicate is made of me.  This duplicate is then asked if he is the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;original, as far as he can tell, he is.  Did he experience subjectivity
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;continuity of consciousness?  Given the information provided in the previous
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;two scenarios, it is reasonable and logical to assume he did not.
</em><br>
<p>That doesn't make sense. You say the copy can't tell he is the copy
<br>
but he can detect a discontinuity of consciousness. Besides, if done
<br>
properly there is no reason you'd have any subjective interruption
<br>
in what you were thinking, even if a billion years had passed between
<br>
thoughts.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Are you saying that nueral activity completes ceases under deep
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;anesthesia? I am highly skeptical of that claim.  You are still breathing?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not breathing on the operating table without mechanical assistance. In brain
<br>
surgery surgeons often lower the body temperature down from the normal 98.6
<br>
to about 82 because then they can stop all blood flow to the brain for several
<br>
minutes while they work on it, the cold prevents the lack of oxygen fed to it during
<br>
that time from causing  brain damage. During that time the brain is as active as
<br>
the brain of a corpse.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt;if you were murdered last night  and replaced by a &quot;copy&quot; is there any
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;rational reason to be upset about  it this morning? I can't think of any.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt;In the sense that a sentient being was lost to the universe, yes there is a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;reason to be upset.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody was lost because you can remember being that sentient being, that's
<br>
what you mean when you say &quot;I&quot; existed last year. What more could you want?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;as I have outlined multiple times, simple because you could have been
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;murdered and couldnt tell that you were *doesnt* mean that you *were*
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;murdered.
</em><br>
<p>True, but it does mean it doesn't matter if you were murdered.
<br>
I'm reminded of a certain type of fantasy story that even as a child I could not
<br>
relate to; all sorts of strange and wonderful things happen to our hero and
<br>
then at the end he is horrified to discover he's dead. I don't get it. I'd be
<br>
absolutely delighted to discover I'm dead because that would mean I was
<br>
mistaken and death was not all it was cracked up to be.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<br>
<em>      &gt;&gt;Einstein  tells us that there is no one true objective rate of change,
</em><br>
<em>      &gt;&gt; it depends on  the  observer.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt;Perhaps you could elaborate on the relevance of that statement, A little
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;confused as to how that relates to the question at hand.
</em><br>
<p>You say there is some maximum rate of change that determines if you are still
<br>
you, but is one neuron a second being replaced, a thousand neurons a second
<br>
or a billion neurons a second, due to time dilation it depends on the speed of the
<br>
observer relative to you. Thus if you are correct  then to some observers the copy
<br>
is truly you and to other observers the copy definitely is not you. That can't be right.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;if you change or alter the state of  an individual nueron (or copy it)
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;in a period of time shorter than its quickest firing time, your brain
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;would never know the difference.
</em><br>
<p>But before you said that to preserve your identity changes should be made
<br>
slowly, now you say it's better if changes are made quickly. For the life of me
<br>
I don't see why, fast or slow, speed should make the slightest difference.
