</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the cracks!  Why!
</em><br>
<p>Remember that this is not far from all the other &quot;How high is your
<br>
EQ?&quot;/&quot;Measure your paranoia potential&quot;/&quot;What is your personality
<br>
archetype?&quot; tests you find in magazines. This one seems to be based on a
<br>
real test that has been validated (hence those numbers), but most likely
<br>
it is just a random subset of questions and has far less statistical
<br>
validity than the original. 
<br>
<p>Creating a workablie psychological test is hard - there are entire
<br>
courses or research groups about this at some psychology departments -
<br>
and takes a tremedous amount of experimentation, statistics and
<br>
analysis. Just look at the effect of cultural factors on the autism
<br>
test; I'm certain far more swedes than americans would be classified as
<br>
autistic by this test, although there is likely no higher incidence of
<br>
autism in Sweden - it is just that the way we would understand and 
<br>
answer the questions is different from the way an american would.
<br>
Normally such tests are translated at great expense to fix such cultural
<br>
factors, at least if they are intended to have some validity. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not claiming that the test is bogus (after all, I scored high, maybe I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really am abnormal along with the other 95% of the population), but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to hear some informed feedback on how people think the test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stands up against a rigorous logical dissection.  What kind of delusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does someone need to score high or low, and be placed in the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category by this test?  (Heck, maybe even asking this question puts me in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;autistic&quot; category, but if that's true, humanity is in serious need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of more autistic people.)
</em><br>
<p>You can create quite accurate tests with surprisingly bad questions. It
<br>
is all an issue of creating a huge test with questions that manage to
<br>
cover the relevant area, getting a lot of people to do it, then examine
<br>
statistically what answers correlate with which group of people. If it
<br>
turns out that all autists answer &quot;purple&quot; as their favorite color, even
<br>
if nobody has the faintest idea why, then that question can be used in a
<br>
slimmed down test that actually manages to identify many autists. Logic
<br>
doesn't come into it. It is all a question of statistics: there will be
<br>
some type one and two errors, a good test manages to keep them
<br>
reasonably small. But since autism is a spectrum, it doesn't make much
<br>
sense to put any rigid limit on what score implies autism and what score
<br>
implies neurotypicality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someday psychologists will discover that there is no normal.  Then it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not-so-simple matter of letting the rest of the world know.
</em><br>
<p>Psychologists have known that for a long time. But the news spread
<br>
slowly because most people doesn't want to hear them...
