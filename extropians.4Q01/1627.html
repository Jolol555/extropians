<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Okay, here is a rephrased an simplified version of my question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Given that intolerant and absolutist memes can by definition exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;within a tolerant and relativist society, but not vice versa, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;strategies can the tolerant and relativist society use to survive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Will these strategies require it to relinquish some of its tolerance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and relativism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's an even simpler version of the trick question you are asking:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can a tolerant person/society not tolerate intolerance and still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered tolerant?  I think the obvious answer is &quot;yes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What strategies will it take?  I think that's a simple one too.  You simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live and let live, until the intolerant person/society uses their liberty to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to relieve you of yours.  At that point you respond with something like,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oh say, operation &quot;Enduring Freedom.&quot;
</em><br>
]
<br>
<p>You must be joking.  This &quot;war&quot; is not about freedom, enduring
<br>
or otherwise.  It is about vengeance, incredible hypocrisy and
<br>
dishonesty about our own &quot;terrorism&quot; and grabbing more power in
<br>
a region where we have been attempting to get rights to pipe oil
<br>
across to growing Southeast Asian market for sometime.  Our
<br>
response has nothing to do with being tolerant or even remotely
<br>
rational.  At the current rate millions of Afghanis will die
<br>
this winter from hunger. Do we honestly belief that is the
<br>
result of our tolerance and fair action and that it is
<br>
justified? If so then I submit that we have become so monstrous
<br>
we do not even comprehend what we are any longer or what our
<br>
ideals are or what we wish they are.  We will have become only a
<br>
self-justifying blind King of Tyrants. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think our aim is to wipe out intolerance, but only by means that will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessarily agitate the intolerant.  Think Chinese handcuffs again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Millions more deaths damn well should agitate any caring
<br>
people.  Being kept in the dark by our own government and having
<br>
our civil liberties auctioned off wholesale to the the very
<br>
instrument of so much that is wrong in the world, the CIA,
<br>
should agitate us.  But we munch away happily on the McNews fed
<br>
to us by media largely controlled by the same corporations that
<br>
made our President and VP rich men and that have manipulate the
<br>
region into its current mess over decades.  But go on as you
<br>
are.  Go on wrapping the tattered rags of your
<br>
self-rigtheousness about your threadbare true lack support for
<br>
freedom, sovereignity, human rights and justice in much of the
<br>
world.  Enjoy your pretense but don't imagine for a second that
<br>
your hatred for those who do not share this game of pretend is
<br>
the just behavior of the &quot;tolerant&quot;.
