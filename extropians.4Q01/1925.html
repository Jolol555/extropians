<em>&gt; Alex I respect you so when you say Samantha has some good qualities I
</em><br>
think
<br>
<em>&gt; it must be true. I also think politeness is a worthwhile virtue but to say
</em><br>
I disagree
<br>
<em>&gt; with her is putting it so mildly, so apathetically, as to be completely
</em><br>
misleading.
<br>
<em>&gt; Some people are trying to kill me, an effort is being made to stop them
</em><br>
but
<br>
<em>&gt; Samantha says that effort should stop immediately. That just makes my
</em><br>
blood boil.
<br>
<em>&gt; She may be a technologically savvy person but on this issue I repeat what
</em><br>
I said,
<br>
<em>&gt; she is a blithering idiot. I would never get this angry if we were arguing
</em><br>
over a
<br>
<em>&gt; technical question or even over politics, but this issue is not something
</em><br>
abstract,
<br>
<em>&gt; it involves my survival and I take it personally.
</em><br>
<p>Not only are Spikes points relevant here -- you're not going to win over
<br>
Samantha or anyone else for that matter by name calling -- but I seriously
<br>
doubt that Samantha or anyone else in this forum has the President's ear.  I
<br>
don't think our debates on policy are uninfluential, but I doubt that even
<br>
if everyone on the list agreed on some specific policy that suddenly the
<br>
Congress, the White House, the Pentagon, and whoever is behind the WTC
<br>
attacks would say, &quot;Oh my God, those Extropian geeks think X should be
<br>
done!&quot;
<br>
<p>Be calm!  I'm very calm, despite the fact that I have seven of the missing
<br>
tactical nukes...:)
