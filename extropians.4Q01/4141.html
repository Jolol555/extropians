</em><br>
<p>This is the most common cloning/GE fear, but the reasons why this is bad
<br>
(and why people use 'over-run' rather than 'enriched') are somewhat
<br>
muddy. Part of it is simply a basic belief that the natural ways are
<br>
right in both a practical and a moral sense, but your argument also
<br>
shows an interesting side which I have not quite seen articulated here
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>If I understood you right, &quot;designer&quot; humans would be determined by
<br>
social or cultural norms to a larger degree than we are right now, and
<br>
since people can easily list many possible distasteful, limiting or
<br>
prejudiced norms it follows that being born naturally protects us from
<br>
them - nature may or may not be &quot;good&quot;, but at least it isn't bigoted. 
<br>
<p>The problems with this reason is 
<br>
<p>1) that usually no estimation of the likeliehood of different bad social
<br>
influences is made. A society where rape is promoted is used to
<br>
demonstrate how evil cultures can be, and it does its rhetorical work
<br>
without having to explain if any such societies are likely to be
<br>
relevant in the future. More likely but low-level bad stuff, like
<br>
traditional sexism or parents seeking to make their childrens like the
<br>
current president, is put on an even footing with the extreme claim. 
<br>
<p>2) the assumption that things will get worse if humans are allowed to
<br>
take responsibility for them. This is largely based on the ease we can
<br>
come up with bad scenarios and examples of mistreatments in the past,
<br>
while leaving out all the good things. One reason is of course that good
<br>
news are not very exciting, so they do not get trumpeted about as much
<br>
or written about in history books. But there is also an assumption here
<br>
that mankind is always fallen, and increased freedom always must result
<br>
in increased evil actions rather than increased evil and good actions.
<br>
<p>3) The assumption that the best way of handling this potential risk is
<br>
to abstain from a technology that could be bad in a repressive society,
<br>
rather than seek to deal with the repressive society. If we are worried
<br>
about sexism, maybe we should see what we can do about sexism in our own
<br>
society. If we are worried about cloning being used to create carbon
<br>
copy people, maybe the right way to handle it is to strengthen
<br>
individualism?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Another (somewhat unrelated) scary thought experiment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People fear cloning/GE used to produce &quot;designer humans&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are better than organic/natural humans.  Has anyone discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fear of using cloning/GE as a weapon?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there are *piles* of rather uninformed fear about cloned armies of
<br>
supersoldiers and genetic weapons. The problem with such a program of
<br>
timed-destruction would of course be that in the meantime there is a
<br>
good chance that somebody will do a gene sequence of a &quot;weaponized&quot;
<br>
person, discover an interesting allele, write a paper about it, others
<br>
would discover its function and suddenly you would have a large part of
<br>
the medical establishment rushing to find a cure for this new genetic
<br>
disease! 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similar to the conspiracy theory behind HIV/AIDS, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this one is a lot scarier.  Unless, genetic testing becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as accessible as HIV testing ...
</em><br>
<p>Given the current trends in paranoia and sequencing technology, it seems
<br>
rather likely.
