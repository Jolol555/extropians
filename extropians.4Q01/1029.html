&quot;Alex F. Bokov&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20Decyphering%20lies&In-Reply-To=&lt;005001c1568b$a51f0140$7650f7a5@computer&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;To concretize this, as far as I can tell, Arab media are feeding their
<br>
listeners an insane conspiracy theory implicating the Mossad in the
<br>
bombings. Hardly an improvement over CNN.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Praytell, why is this &quot;insane&quot;?  
<br>
Fact. Several thousand people died on 911.
<br>
Fact. The primary official suspects have repeatedly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stated that their reason for performing actions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similar to (but not so drastic as) 9-11 are an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt to prosecute a conflict/war with 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(their words) &quot;Zionists and their supporters&quot;.
<br>
Fact. The Israeli government has performed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actions in the past which are consistent with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treachery towards it's most stalwart ally.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These include
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  1956. The &quot;Lavon Scandal&quot;, where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Israeli Defense Minister was forced to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resign after it was revealed that Israeli intelligence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was plotting to destroy American installations in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt and blame this on the Arabs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. 1967. The USS Liberty. 34 sailors dead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174 wounded. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. 1986. The libyan code affair. We killed the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libyan president's daughter in our response.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further Examples Exist.
<br>
Fact. The Israeli government has stated AND demonstrated
<br>
time and again that there is absolutely no measure they
<br>
will not take if they are (honestly and truly) convinced it
<br>
is the only way to preserve the state of Israel. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact. Bin Laden has sworn on the Koran that he didn't
<br>
do 9-11. 
<br>
Opinion. I have no idea whether Mossad or any other
<br>
party was the party behind 9-11 (behind in the sense
<br>
of mastermind, rather than the triggermen). I have
<br>
absolutely no illusions that Mossad or the Israeli
<br>
government is incapable of performing such actions
<br>
should they feel them to be &quot;neccessary&quot;. I am especially
<br>
taken with the fact that there is a logical fallacy based
<br>
on motivation for the Bin Laden hypothesis.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposition. Bin Laden is a fanatical partisan of Islam.
<br>
He performs these many monstrous evil deeds because
<br>
of his &quot;faith&quot;. This is his presumed motivation for 9-11.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However. Bin Laden is reported (by the former Pakistani
<br>
Minister of Defense, himself a devout Muslim) to have
<br>
sworn to his old friend on his Holy Koran that he was not
<br>
responsible for 9-11. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So is he devout enough to blow us up, but apostate enough
<br>
to swear before his God that he didn't do it?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the proper pattern. We should be open to
<br>
alternate explanations. 
<br>
&nbsp;Opinion. Taliban is evil. Bin Laden is evil. Israel is evil.
<br>
(insofar as &quot;evil&quot; is a word with meaning). A plague on
<br>
both their houses. Let the Arabs slaughter the Jews,
<br>
drill Alaska full of holes, and sell OUR oil to Japan
<br>
and Europe and let the Muslim world find it's own way. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex, please feel free to support your offhand characterization
<br>
of the Mossad theory as &quot;insane&quot;... but as always..
<br>
be prepared to get clubbed with the big stick of truth.
<br>
In this case it's a really BIG stick.
<br>
<p><p>regards,
<br>
Brian
