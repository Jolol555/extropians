<em>&gt; &gt; See, this is what I'm talking about. Crossing the fine line between

<em>&gt; &gt; disbelieving our own gov's propoganda and believing the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll try to clarify my point.  There is no need to assign them the charge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing every american to make them the bad guys, and there is no need for them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to want to kill every american to make them the bad guys.  I do believe they are

</em><br>
<p>The problem is one of focus and opportunity. Take one bin Laden fanboy.
<br>
Give said fanboy a plan and the means to execute said plan. He doesn't
<br>
much care WHICH Americans he kills, just so long as he bags his limit.
<br>
<p>Much like a hunter shooting at a flock of birds with a shotgun: he
<br>
doesn't much care which individual bird he kills, so long as he kills as
<br>
many as he is legally allowed. For all practical purposes, from the
<br>
standpoint of each individual bird, the hunter wants to kill each
<br>
individual as much as any other individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this standpoint, bin Laden therefore wants to kill ME, YOU, and
</em><br>
John Clark, as well as every other American. It's nothing personal, and
<br>
he's not aiming for us as individuals, he's just hoping to nail as many
<br>
of us as he is able, indiscriminately. AND, like the hunter, he doesn't
<br>
necessarily want to kill ALL of us at the same time. He just wants to
<br>
kill enough of us as it takes to achieve his desired outcome.
