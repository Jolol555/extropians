<p>
Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>As most people already know by now, ALCOR has a new president/CEO with 
<br>
definite goals in mind.  I have not yet found out what are Dr. Jerry 
<br>
Lemler's 34 points to improve ALCOR.  But, by putting my imagination to 
<br>
work, I have come up with what COULD be his plan.
<br>
<p>1.  To remind himself of home, have all ALCOR employees learn to speak with 
<br>
a southern accent!
<br>
<p>2.  Install a ninety-nine cents all-you-can-eat buffet.  This will bring in 
<br>
people like nothing else!
<br>
<p>3.  Discontinue the term, &quot;neuro-stasis.&quot;  Instead, replace it with a term 
<br>
taken from the 7-11 convenience store advertising campaign for slushies, 
<br>
which happens to be, &quot;brain-freeze!&quot;  And use their picture of a young boy 
<br>
with an agonized facial expression because the slushy coldness just hit him!
<br>
<p>4.  Time for Hugh Hixon, Mike Perry and others to finally leave the nest!  
<br>
But, they can always come back to have dinner with the family.
<br>
<p>5.  Ten hours of free psychoanalysis for everyone who signs up!  One hour 
<br>
weekly of free psychoanalysis to all staff members.
<br>
<p>6.  Plan expedition to capture bigfoot -then freeze him!
<br>
<p>7.  Offer Osama Bin Laden a nice refreshing liquid nitrogen bath to cool 
<br>
down from all the stress he has been under!
<br>
<p>8.  Tell Fred Chamberlain he needs to learn how to clone money!  Wait, that 
<br>
may be illegal!
<br>
<p>9.  Insist Charles Platt write one unabashedly super-optimistic column for 
<br>
the ALCOR magazine.  I mean on par with a typical post from George Smith!
<br>
<p>10.  Start up a new t.v. cable show called, &quot;This Week at Alcor.&quot;  Do not 
<br>
hire those Wayne and Garth guys to host it...
<br>
<p>11.  Create a cryonics promoting rock band!  Name it, &quot;Frozen Heads!&quot;
<br>
<p>12.  Recruit Bill Gates!
<br>
<p>13.  Start up the first ever, &quot;Cryonics Olympics!&quot;  Then beat try to beat 
<br>
Robert Ettinger in the swimming competition.
<br>
<p>14.  Train my cat to ferociously defend ALCOR facilities from intruders.
<br>
<p>15.  Invest all extra income into lottery tickets.  When we win big, money 
<br>
problems solved!!
<br>
<p>16.  Send some muscle over to those Cells4Life guys, tell 'em a five per 
<br>
cent cut just ain't enough anymore!  Uncle Jerry is raising his cut to ten 
<br>
per cent!  Or just tell them it's one of those religious tithing deals!
<br>
<p>17.  Recruit Wierd Al Yankovic!  He can write songs which will really 
<br>
promote cryonics in just the way we want people to see it...
<br>
<p>18.  Move ALCOR to the Vegas strip!!  ALCOR Casino here we come!!  Our money 
<br>
problems will finally be solved!  But first, must ask banks for a 
<br>
five-hundred million dollar loan to raise the necessary capital.
<br>
<p>19.  Start up an ALCOR debate team!  Charles Platt will be team captain!
<br>
<p>20.  Start up an ALCOR telethon!  There must be enough interesting 
<br>
cryonicists to keep it going for twenty-four hours!
<br>
<p>21.  Recruit Julia Roberts for John Grigg.  This will allow John to see 
<br>
Julia at ALCOR activities.  John says he will definitely relocate from 
<br>
Alaska for this.
<br>
<p>22.  To raise money start up a part-time psychiatric practice in Scottsdale 
<br>
where I will specialize in patients with a deep fear of death.  &quot;Why I head 
<br>
an organization which could really help you...&quot;
<br>
<p>23.  Start dressing like Dr. Evil!
<br>
<p>24.  Have a class of second graders paint bright murals on the boring ALCOR 
<br>
walls, inside and out.
<br>
<p>25.  Hold a tribute to Robert Ettinger as a founding father of cryonics 
<br>
before he eventually dies.
<br>
<p>26.  Have the ALCOR magazine revamped by the editors of Esquire.
<br>
<p>27.  Update pre-pentium computers with quantum computing models!
<br>
<p>28.  Ask Tim Burton to redesign the ALCOR ambulance.
<br>
<p>29.  Equip each standby team member with a surplus issue Mig-21 fighter jet! 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure first everyone has a pilot's license...
<br>
<p>30.  Have the 2002 ALCOR conference in Vegas, then in 2003 follow John 
<br>
Grigg's advice and have it at the playboy mansion.  Wives and girlfriends 
<br>
may veto this...
<br>
<p>31.  Brag even more about my great family!!
<br>
<p>32.  Start up the ALCOR Polar Bear Club!  Actually, considering the climate 
<br>
here, I should create the ALCOR Roadrunner Heatstroke Club!
<br>
<p>33.  Recruit Larry Ellison!
<br>
<p>34.  Make ALCOR the number one tourist attraction in Arizona!!  And to 
<br>
prepare for this, have Hugh Hixon develop a recipe for the ALCOR 
<br>
super-slushy!  Obviously, it will be sold in a very well insulated 
<br>
container.
<br>
<p>I hope I made some people smile with this.  Because after all, this COULD be 
<br>
his plan!
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John  : )
