</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;     I think they assume that self interest, disregarding the rest of the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think it's important to remember that with so many people being involved
<br>
in _any_ action taken that can be labeled &quot;US foreign policy&quot;, _somebody_
<br>
in the group, or the group supporting the group, will be acting in self-interest.
<br>
<p>Making the simple bare claim is cartoonish, but comfortable. Same story, different day.
<br>
Cui bono, _specifically_? And what about those who _don't_ benefit, but still think
<br>
doing &lt;whatever&gt; is important? Too hard to figure that out, let's just get our story
<br>
straight and put it out there; we have deadlines, after all.
<br>
<p>&lt;much good stuff about human nature from Anders elided&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;And remember - we are your *allies*. Now think about the rest of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not to be a total dick, but during WW2 Sweden was a neutral. ;-) Also during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cold war.  :o(    Heeeeeeey!!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually (to get things straight, rather than defend the country) Sweden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was secretly allied during the cold war and did quite a bit of signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scanning for NATO - while the government orated to the public about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine neutrality we held. Hypocricy anyone?
</em><br>
<p>Hypocrites (when I write that, I always think it's the name of a preSocratic
<br>
philosopher--and it might be; but his works are so much in evidence! :) )...
<br>
<p>Ahem. Start over. As I get old, I find &quot;Hypocritical&quot; is far from the worst label
<br>
one can have--I speak of, and as, an individual. The label can be, and is, laid on
<br>
a person who has changed his mind in his lifetime, or in the last year, hour, day
<br>
or moment. 
<br>
<p>All that person need to have done is to communicate, and then communicate
<br>
(or act) in a way incongruent to the earlier communication. Anyone who disapproves has
<br>
an easy label to hang.
<br>
<p>This can mean that the only way to be &quot;sincere&quot; is to never grow or change.
<br>
<p>That said, and wishing though I do that clear, open communication which
<br>
remains consistent, sensible and congruent were the norm, I can't wish for it
<br>
at the level of entire countries and their actions during wartime. 
<br>
Two salient aphorisms for me: &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick,&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;Diplomacy is the art of saying 'nice doggy' until you find a big enough rock.'&quot;
<br>
<p>All heuristics can be distorted, distended and so on. Where is the hypocrisy?
<br>
If I'm on a slow alcohol IV drip, exactly when do I become drunk?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...[I]n a world where there is enormous suspicion and paranoia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the US, the situation might become dangerous if some new major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power emerges (be it China, India or (rather unlikely) EU) without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolving both this widespread anti-americanism and american myopia.
</em><br>
<p>And &quot;they who bury the hatchet never forget where they buried them.&quot;
<br>
<p>There is another principle I value very highly in the civilization of the USA;
<br>
it's a principle of law--I'm not sure if it shows up in Blackstone or where. 
<br>
<p>&quot;There must be an end to disputes.&quot; 
<br>
<p>This, along with the purpose-of-government-is-to-secure-rights-of-all-people
<br>
nugget from the Declaration of Independence, is part of my personal mythos.
<br>
And I mean &quot;mythos&quot; in the old-fashioned way, not the post-modern way--on a good day.
<br>
<p>But it's another act of faith, with many underpinning presumptions making it possible--
<br>
the most obvious being that we're all in this together. 
<br>
<p>And feudalists might believe it, too--but the &quot;we&quot; is different. &quot;We&quot; can end the dispute
<br>
sure enough when whoever &quot;we&quot; are feuding with gets the full Carthage. &quot;There's your end 
<br>
of the dispute, mate!&quot; Just how much revenge is enough seems to vary.
<br>
<p>Am I feuding these days?
<br>
<p>I'm not sure.
