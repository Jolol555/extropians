Amara stated:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;However, the U.S. government and citizens doesn't have experience, or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge to handle messes like this in a way where the problem could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be solved. In a comon &quot;can-do&quot; American attitude, the government and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;folks think that they can solve the world's problems, they don't have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an understanding of the history, of the the volatile mix of cultures,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and more often than not, the U.S. government makes it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worse. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am old enough to remember the Vietnam War and the notion that armies can 
<br>
fall into morasses, if the policy makers do not know their own limits; as 
<br>
well as the attitudes and beliefs of the local population being effected.  
<br>
The American experience was aptly, called &quot;trying to destroy a swarm of bees 
<br>
with a sledge hammer.&quot;
<br>
<p>One of the policy failures was the judgment by two administrations, to avoid, 
<br>
at all costs, the arrival of Chinese participation in the war, and 
<br>
concurrently, the reluctance to take the war to the enemies soil-North 
<br>
Vietnam.  
<br>
<p>My contention is that the United States must offer an alternative, solution 
<br>
to the Wahabbi power structure, in place, in the Muslim world; preferably a 
<br>
secular power structure. Secondly and most importantly, is we must separate 
<br>
ourselves from Saudi Oil, because we are addicts to their oil, and behave 
<br>
like addicts who have a chemical dependancy.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If you don't think that what you're dealing with is a big problem,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then please study some history of that area over the last 50-700
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amara&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I understand what you are saying, and clear thinking is needed in this 
<br>
situation. But the attacks on America and Europe will Not cease unless 
<br>
hostile regimes and terror networks are literally toppled. I knew that on 
<br>
September 11th and am no stranger to the mentality of the &quot;levant&quot; as it was 
<br>
known in 19th century France. The next attacks will be chemical or nuclear, 
<br>
simply because if one wishes to disrupt and destabilize the &quot;West&quot;, this is 
<br>
one of the easiest ways to accomplish this. 
<br>
<p>The problem with the Islamic Terrorists is they can hide amongst a 
<br>
semi-sympathetic, local population. So what to do? Answer, just what we are 
<br>
doing-toppling a regime that is hostile to us and co-mingled with Al-Qeida. 
<br>
There is more we need to do, on the &quot;reward&quot; side of the business, but we 
<br>
also need the stick.
<br>
<p>I can respect the other fellow's point of view, but when it comes down to 
<br>
making tough choices on whose lives are lost, it is a rude awakening. Tough 
<br>
choices have been made, and will be continued to be made over the next 
<br>
several years. Our enemy has made the mistake of forcing us to fight or 
<br>
die-not smart, that.
