On Mon, 26 Nov 2001, Mike Lorrey asked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can anyone point to some arguments against reproductive cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are not just &quot;because it's so&quot; statements?
</em><br>
<p>Michael West kind of summed it up on the Today show.  He said
<br>
something like &quot;I know why these people are against cloning.
<br>
They think if they ban cloning it validates their position
<br>
that abortion and IVF are wrong.&quot;  If they can get cloning
<br>
banned it puts them on track toward eliminating a variety
<br>
of other things they do not like.  A cloning ban might
<br>
give them some improved arguments for challenging Roe V. Wade.
<br>
<p>The *fundamental* problem with &quot;reproductive&quot; cloning (where
<br>
you actually intend to produce a real live sentient human
<br>
being) is that there are no indications that we have a good
<br>
understanding for exactly which genes get &quot;imprinted&quot; (marked
<br>
as coming from the father or mother) and we have no means to
<br>
do the imprinting that is normally done during the maturation
<br>
of eggs or sperm.  Further, we have no really good feel for
<br>
whether we have successfully &quot;rolled back&quot; the state information
<br>
in cells taken from adults so that development will proceed
<br>
normally.  The experiments with animals to date have shown
<br>
that even if you get an animal that survives the developmental
<br>
process, you still may have handicaps of various types.
<br>
<p>So the risks are significantly greater than normal that you
<br>
might have a handicapped child.  Many people would argue
<br>
that its iffy from a moral/extropic position to bring
<br>
potentially handicapped children into the world *now*, when
<br>
you could wait a few years and have significantly reduced
<br>
those risks (when we know more).  The thing that is probably
<br>
*really* annoying the &quot;right-to-lifers&quot; is the fact that you
<br>
are likely to increase the abortion rate because if doctors notice
<br>
a malformed fetus is developing they are probably likely
<br>
to recomend its termination.  You could imagine couples
<br>
going through several abortions before they got a child
<br>
that was developing properly.
<br>
<p>Now, of course &quot;therapeutic&quot; cloning is a different game
<br>
because you only need to have &quot;good&quot; genes that function
<br>
properly in the type of tissue you are trying to produce.
<br>
So the success probabilities for therapeutic cloning should
<br>
eventually be quite a bit higher than reproductive cloning.
<br>
<p>Any serious &quot;philosophical&quot; arguments against cloning in
<br>
general seem to revolve around a fundamental respect for
<br>
what is &quot;human&quot;.  They are essentially arguments for
<br>
maintaining humanity as it is.  They seem to me to be
<br>
curtains pulled over the argument that we are &quot;made
<br>
in God's image&quot; and shouldn't change that.
