This is the part 1 of my answer to &quot;Jacques Du Pasquier&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jacques@dtext.com?Subject=Re:%20A%20Mind%20and%20No%20Body&In-Reply-To=&lt;EB5DDEEFC7B4D411AD3B00508BDFF3E202319136@1upmc-msx7.isdip.upmc.edu&gt;">jacques@dtext.com</a>&gt;
<br>
:
<br>
<p><p>You guessed it : I find it hard to believe ; and I suspect that
<br>
something unessential in this setup accounts for your imagined
<br>
emotional state.
<br>
<p>So to make my point even harder to escape, suppose that it starts like
<br>
above, except that you are free, all the three of you, and #2 and #3,
<br>
for some reason unknown to you, are trying to kill you. Suppose the
<br>
only way to avoid being killed is to kill them. What will you do ?
<br>
<p>### If #2 and #3 are trying to kill me for unknown reasons, I have
<br>
significant doubts about their integrity (in many of the meanings of the
<br>
word). Until they can convince me to my satisfaction that my death is
<br>
necessary to preserve the existence of my memories and personality carried
<br>
in their bodies, I will vigorously oppose their efforts. In fact, in the
<br>
absence of reliable data about the copying process (evil scientists don't
<br>
publish, do they?) I would believe that they are not my copies, merely look
<br>
like me, or else they are enslaved copies, mind puppets of their evil
<br>
creator. 
<br>
<p>So I would have a problem in the situation you describe, not with copying
<br>
per se but rather insufficient information and control.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>This is just the way I see it. However, I don't find it very
<br>
consistent with what you previously said, ie having thousands of you,
<br>
and employers being able of hiring a bunch of you for some tasks, etc.
<br>
Maybe you got carried away by the fun of the thought ? :-)
<br>
<p>### If the conditions are right, the optimal number of copies could be very
<br>
large. 
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but not too large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to strain the available resources or dangerously reduce mental diversity.
</em><br>
<p><p>As you know such considerations are useless on a personal scale : if
<br>
you do restrain yourself in order not to reduce mental diversity, you
<br>
will simply be outnumbered by someone who will not restrain himself.
<br>
(see below for social control)
<br>
<p>### If the society is controlled by persons opposed to truly unlimited
<br>
growth (which is sometimes destructive - if a stupid narcissistic slob
<br>
without concern for others and without scientifc skills starts
<br>
proliferating, he will either be stopped, or the whole society will be wiped
<br>
out), minds prone to such behavior will be either suppressed (by laws and
<br>
threats of sanctions, as precancerous cells are controlled by some hormonal
<br>
influences), or destroyed (as sometimes cancerous cells are eradicated by
<br>
antibodies and NK cells, but hopefully more efficiently).
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>The social control of autocopy (self-copy) seems to be 1) practically
<br>
impossible 2) contrary to freedom and self ownership. (Of course, in
<br>
the limits of respecting others, that is, not disassembling them to
<br>
assemble more copies of you.)
<br>
<p>### Where there is a will, there is a way - self-copying minds should not be
<br>
more difficult to control than rats, if you have the right technology. Any
<br>
mind which transgresses against laws (as in property laws, taking over space
<br>
and resources assigned to other minds, and I mean not only other bodies and
<br>
brains but also other persons' homes, air, bank accounts atc.), can and will
<br>
be stopped, in accordance with the principles of free market, or state
<br>
ownership of means of self-copying, or whichever method of control works
<br>
best.
<br>
<p><pre>
----
<p>So it would seem that if autocopy becomes feasible and nanotech
efficiency happens as expected, we will have such an evolution. While
autocopy is not a goal in itself for you, the world will quietly fill
with mutants for whom it is. With an open world (space) this might be
OK after all.
<p>Our evolution-inherited taste for variety might somehow auto-regulate
this as we won't enjoy living with autocopies.
<p>If the value system is changed, then the regulation might come, in the
presence of big challenges, from intrinsic inferiority of lack of
variety, which is why we inherited taste for variety in the first
place.
<p>### Exactly. There will be lots of competing self-copiers, keeping each
other in check.
<p>----
<p>What's different here is : that around which everything revolved (the
body), and was the foundation of all goals and values, is suppressed.
What emerged as a better control mechanism is detached from what it
controls, and imagined to pursue a life of its own.
<p>### Exactly - you describe very well what I mean, except for the word
&quot;imagine&quot; - anything that fills the world with its copies isn't just
imagining life, it is doing it. Computer viruses are currently approaching
the lowest order of life - already  capable of spreading (if only in
computer networks) but still requiring creators (or maybe Creators?) to
start them. The selfcopying minds, having no external maker, would be true
life.
<p>----
<p>&gt; Once the apeman stopped knuckle-walking, it became possible to neglect
this
&gt; use of the the forelegs and new uses could develop. I do think that I will
&gt; discard some parts of my mind which might no longer be useful to a copied
or
&gt; disembodied sentience. Soon we will be able to switch off and modify parts
&gt; of our brains, see how the whole works in practice, and then revert to the
&gt; initial design (if we miss what we got rid of) or try new changes, 
<p><p>You may underestimate the hopelesness in which you will be to make any
such choice.
<p>### ???
<p>-----
You orient yourself on evolution-given affective clues. Won't you be
lost when you start changing yourself ? People cannot even control
their lifes if they take little drugs, so that they quickly consider
it an error and make cures to stop. Any change like the ones you
propose will be many times more drastic than any drugs. It will
totally mess with your million years super-sound stratified
organization, and you will have no clue how to regain equilibrium,
unless by getting back to normal.
<p>### There is a great book by C.J.Cherryh, &quot;Cyteen&quot;, about the possible
developments of self-modification. Obviously, I will have to be very careful
before messing with some parts of my mind, especially the ones currently
running in my ACC, nucleus accumbens, or periaqueductal gray. I would first
start with the simpler sensory elements - the color spectrum analysis
routines in my lingual gyrus, for example. Just like Eliezer's Seed AI, I
would need to develop a &quot;codic modality&quot;, a part of my brain cortex devoted
to self analysis. If you are optimistic about Eliezer's chances of success
(as I am), you can be hopeful about the same applied to your own mind.
<p>------
What I rather expect (now) -- and that's the way I understand
transhumanism -- is a continuation of our evolution. We won't recreate
ourselves arbitrarily, we will keep pursuing our values by new means,
because this is the meaning of our lifes, out of which we would get
lost, loosing interest in ourselves.
<p>### You are right - at least in the beginnig it would be unwise to start
modifying our basic ethical goals. However, this is not a reason to refrain
from changing other things, as I wrote above.
<p>------
<p><p>The modification of our goals is something we have yet to think about
in a serious way : for on what base could we choose our goals, except
on the existing evolution-given ones ?
<p>### Self-evolution might come up with something. You might read Stanislaw
Lem's &quot;Invincible&quot;.
<p>-----
<p>I think it is important to acknowledge how deeply we are rooted in
this, and not be deceived by superficial self images.
<p>### &quot;Know thyself&quot; is the most important injunction for any self-modifier.
<p>-----
<p>&gt; Does &quot;centralized nervous system&quot; even
&gt; mean anything outside of a body ?
&gt; 
&gt; ### If you mean existence without a material substrate, then it doesn't
(at
&gt; least I think so). If you mean existence without direct access to physical
&gt; manipulators, then yes - it means the ability to analyze and integrate
&gt; available information and produce more or less useful thoughts.
<p><p>They might be useful to others, but not to you if you have no physical
manipulators. You may function as a brain slave. (for a few days,
after which your creativity falls to zero as you loose interest in
yourself)
<p>### At the risk of sounding repetitive, &quot;Diaspora&quot; describes perfectly
reasonable ways of living without physical manipulators (at least until your
planet is in danger of getting fried by the uncaring world around it).
------
<p>It's a shame I have that SF allergy.
<p>Should I remove it in my remake ?
<p>### I would never presume to dictate such a personal choice. You willl be
master of yourself in ways you can't even imagine now. You will be making
choices, maybe by declining to choose.
<p>-----
This illustrates my point : I am willing to replace my deffective
(from my current point of view) parts, to augment myself, to
complement myself in order to reach the goals that make sense to me. I
want to get rid of toothache (and of the need of brushing them,
too !), and other similar pains, I don't want to die and I want to
keep developing indefinitely along the lines of my desires and
interests, possibly accelerating the pace of development.
<p>### It's almost exactly what I want, except I am a bit more bullish about
modification of certain higher information processing routines in my mind.
<p>------
But I am far from being ready to recreate myself arbitrarily like God
is thought by Christian to have created man.
<p>### If indeed God made man in vis image, aren't our goals ultimately derived
from vis own? 
(let's stay away from religious imagery, it gives me the creeps)
-------
<p>Goals were brought by evolution, and all our talks revolve around them,
starting with the will to avoid death. It is our passive animation by
goals that provides meaning to our lifes.
<p>### I am a goal - a vortex of thoughts, not animated by outside agency - my
goals are inside me, because we are one and the same. My body is the passive
chunk of meat animated by my will, and evolution is its parent.
