<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Here's the first and last law of zenarchy:
<br>
Any sufficiently hyper-cognitive complex adaptive system abandons all desire&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>Do You have any evidence of this contention, from a peer-reviewed study? Or 
<br>
were you just throwing that statement up as hand-waving, merely for the 
<br>
purpose of sarcastic comparatvity? Saracastic comparativity is just fine, but 
<br>
sometimes clarification is necessary in the wonderful world of posts.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A better quote from Clarke: &quot;Science can destroy religion by ignoring it as
<br>
well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am
<br>
aware, the nonexistence of Zeus or Thor, but they have few followers now.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Hey! That specific quote was in the Shermer article, after all. Now, is 
<br>
religion an adaptive process also? Is Clarke's religion belief in  
<br>
zero-point, over-unity engines, which despite his recent statements have not 
<br>
appeared on the store shelves?
<br>
<p>If ETI's existed, and were able to make themselves known to us, then religion 
<br>
would certainly change, and I guess that one of Shermer's points was that the 
<br>
space aliens might become the diety or actually be the diety. Weird. And 
<br>
quite probably useless. Caraumba!
