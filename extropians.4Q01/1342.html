<p>The snailless office seems like a good idea, but in the end it only buys
<br>
time.  Even as you try and figure out a way to conduct all business by
<br>
Internet, Microsoft employees are working long into the night, developing
<br>
a way to send anthrax spores as an email attachment under Microsoft
<br>
Outlook.
