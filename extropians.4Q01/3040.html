<em>&gt; Sad to hear. I would hope much of it wound up in private collections or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign museums -- where it has a better chance of being preserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than in a war zone.

<p>So sad.
<br>
<p>Prof. Victor Sarianidi [Institute of Archaeology, Moscow] for more than thirty
<br>
years has crossed the deserts of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan searching
<br>
for ancient settlements. He discovered a 4,000 year-old civilization in the regions
<br>
of Bactria and Margiana, and found six untouched burials. These burials contained
<br>
over 20,000 gold objects of exquisite workmanship.
<br>
<p>Ahmed Shah Massoud declared (to Newsweek magazine), just before his death,
<br>
that  &lt;&lt; The Tillya-tepe treasures [about 20,000 golden pieces] were in the presidential
<br>
palace basement [during 1996]  in a safe with a steel gate and a password for entry.
<br>
When the Talibans came, they gave a receipt to the director of the bank saying “we safely
<br>
receive all the treasures of the bank,” and I have a copy of that receipt.&gt;&gt;. He also said
<br>
&lt;&lt; To be honest, under the circumstances that we are in and considering we are fighting
<br>
a war, we have not done much. We have taken small steps. For instance, it was reported
<br>
to us that there were illegal excavations in Panshjir Valley. We confiscated certain things
<br>
that people had already found and stopped the excavations. When I was informed we made
<br>
it very clear. But I am more in favor of these historical artifacts remaining underground and
<br>
buried for the time being. One of my regrets is that I didn’t take the objects of the Afghan
<br>
National Museum of Kabul to a safer place. &gt;&gt;
