</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does that make sense?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Oh, and by the way, no I didn't think I was running in a sim, until recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maybe. I came across this argument about nested simulations recently (or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the best argument for the existence of &quot;god&quot; (in the broadest possible

</em><br>
<em>&gt;:-)
</em><br>
<p>Moving to a better-considered could be fun!
<br>
<p>(I'm a non-religious agnostic, if anybody wondered.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;One piece of the argument which troubles me is this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Since the experiences that an observer has if she is living in a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are indistinguishable from those she has if she is living in unmediated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical reality, it follows from a very weak form of the principle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indifference that the probability of her living in a simulation equals the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraction of observers that live in simulations[5]. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This seems to take it for granted that an entity living in the &quot;real world&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(at the root) and an entity living inside any level of sim are equivalent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms of what I might call &quot;being&quot;, for wont of a better term. ie: there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no significant difference between a simulated being and an actual being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While this may be the case, it does assume a strong materialist view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness. This must be the case for the principle of indifference to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apply. That's probably ok, but maybe it needs to be stated explicitly?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I call it substrate-independence. I don't argue for this assumption in 
<br>
the paper but I note that it enjoys fairly wide support (among those doing 
<br>
the philosophy of mind) and it is generally assumed in transhumanist 
<br>
discussions about uploading etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;A couple of other points:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Reality may thus contain many levels. Even if it is necessary for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hierarchy to bottom out at some stage - the metaphysical status of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claim is somewhat obscure - there may be room for a large number of levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of reality, and the number could be increasing over time. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Speaking about change over time in the overall hierarchy of simulations is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit dangerous. While it might be true that there is a loose &quot;arrow of time&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the whole set of simulations/universes (simuverses?), with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hierarchy defining dependencies, it is still the case that time, as part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the notion of space/time, is local to each given simulation... if it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensibly defined in all. To give a very basic example, it is entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible that a given sim might be run backwards, if the universes' creators
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had reversed the physical laws, such that the local experience of time in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the inner sim was reversed when compared to the outer sim.
</em><br>
<p>The above remark presumes the case where the hierarchy bottoms out, and the 
<br>
time-direction referred to is then simply the direction of time's arrow in 
<br>
the physical basement universe at this bottom level.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I would have thought that, if you are arguing that the probability that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are in a sim approximates 1,
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't argue that. (I'd actually put the probability to less than 30%.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  you are likewise arguing that the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sims approximates infinity (or some slightly more sensible statement), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does so right now (in whatever reference you draw &quot;now&quot; from).
</em><br>
<p>If there were a rapidly increasing
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;(One consideration that counts against the multi-level hypothesis is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the computational costs for the basement-level simulators would be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;great. Simulating even a single posthuman civilization might be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive. If so, then we should expect our simulation to be terminated when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we are about to reach the posthuman stage.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This makes major assumptions about the physics of computation outside of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe, which are entirely ungrounded in my opinion. It may be that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more common for infinite computing capacity to be possible in sims than not.
</em><br>
<p>It counts against the multi-level hypothesis because we don't know that 
<br>
computation is (nearly) free in the basement-universe.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Alternatively, it does not take into account the possibility that the sim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be rigged to slow down, relative to the outer sim, to make up for lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of concurrent execution resources. As the relative time frames became
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinitely divergent (the inner sim approaching stasis with respect to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outer sim), the inner sim would approach infinite computational ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*with respect to its own time frame&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The simulators may, however, decide to shut it down when the pace in their 
<br>
world of our simulation gets too slow so that they don't see anything 
<br>
interesting happening anymore.
