<p>I'm sorry, I see my phrase: &quot;in tune with suffering&quot; was a very
<br>
poor choice of words. Better would be &quot;in tune with emotions&quot;.
<br>
My apologies. How about these words: intuitive and thoughtfully
<br>
aware, self-revealing, melancholgy, sensitive, introverted,
<br>
feels different from others, sometimes a dreamer, emotionally honest.
<br>
On the bad-days side this personality type feels desparing, tormented,
<br>
and so on, but you can find this in all of the personality types.
<br>
<p>Key motivations: wants to understand himself or herself, to express
<br>
himself in something beautiful, to withdraw to protect his feelings,
<br>
to take care of emotional needs before attending to anything else.
<br>
<p>These are just a few words to capture the essence. Yes, it's
<br>
more Enneagram stuff. I find it very useful to help me to
<br>
figure out people's motivations, since I'm normally hopeless about
<br>
that. It's just a system, though (and I'm a five, so I _like_
<br>
systems...).
