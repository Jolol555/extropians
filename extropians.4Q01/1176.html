<p>Actually, cutting an asteroid up is not that tough. You take a couple
<br>
thousand yards of diamond impregnated cable, a motor, and a
<br>
counter-rotating flywheel, you can cut through rather quickly. While the
<br>
metal may be radiation hardened at the granular level, it is also not
<br>
that densely packed and sintered due to the low g environment. Using
<br>
lasers would also be a useful means of cutting it up. Even M class
<br>
asteroids also tend to collect a regolith coating of mixed
<br>
silica/aluminum compounds, which could be used in producing home grown
<br>
solar panels for power needs.
