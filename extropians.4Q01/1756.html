<p>Hi Matt -
<br>
<p>Below is the CCLE response to information in the Washington Post 
<br>
indicating that the FBI is considering using torture and 
<br>
mind-altering drugs to get the 9-11 detainees to talk. Please forward 
<br>
to your list. (Sources with URLS are given at the bottom.)

Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics (CCLE)
<br>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<br>
October 25, 2001
<br>
<p>Drugging or Torture of 9-11 Suspects Breaks Constitution, Law, and Treaties
<br>
<p>Amidst reports that the FBI is considering the use of forced drugging 
<br>
and even torture to make suspects in the September 11 attacks divulge 
<br>
information, the Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics (CCLE) is 
<br>
calling on the FBI and other government agencies involved in the 
<br>
investigation to respect US and International law, which strictly 
<br>
forbids such invasive and brutal police tactics.
<br>
The Washington Post reported on Sunday that in an effort to extract 
<br>
information from the detainees, FBI and Justice Department 
<br>
investigators are considering using drugs or pressure tactics, such 
<br>
as those employed occasionally by Israeli interrogators, to extract 
<br>
information. Another idea is extraditing the suspects to allied 
<br>
countries where security services sometimes employ threats to family 
<br>
members or resort to torture. (Walter Pincus, &quot;Silence of 4 Terror 
<br>
Probe Suspects Poses Dilemma&quot;, Washington Post, Sunday, October 21, 
<br>
2001; Page A06)
<br>
<p>&quot;The use of torture or physical intimidation to force a suspect to 
<br>
reveal information is a clear violation of US and International law&quot; 
<br>
says Attorney Richard Glen Boire, Executive Director of the Center 
<br>
for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics. The Fifth Amendment to the US 
<br>
Constitution guarantees that no person shall be compelled in any 
<br>
criminal case to be a witness against himself, and protects all 
<br>
people on US soil, whether citizens or not. Torturing a person in 
<br>
order to extract a confession is inherently coercive and renders any 
<br>
subsequent statements compelled, involuntary, unreliable, and wholly 
<br>
unconstitutional.
<br>
<p>Invoking the Fifth Amendment, some of the 9-11 detainees have 
<br>
asserted their constitutional right to remain silent, refusing to 
<br>
speak with investigators. It's deeply disturbing, says Boire, that 
<br>
the act of asserting the constitutional right to remain silent is 
<br>
what is provoking the authorities to consider resorting to torture 
<br>
and drugging.
<br>
<p>Numerous international conventions prohibit the use of torture as an 
<br>
intelligence gathering technique. Article 5 of the Universal 
<br>
Declaration of Human Rights and article 7 of the International 
<br>
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both provide that no one 
<br>
shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
<br>
treatment or punishment.
<br>
<p>Likewise the International Convention against Torture and Other 
<br>
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention 
<br>
Against Torture), prohibits any act by which severe pain or 
<br>
suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on 
<br>
a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person 
<br>
information or a confession.
<br>
<p>The Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics is particularly disturbed 
<br>
by reports that FBI agents may try and skirt US and international 
<br>
prohibitions on physical torture by instead interrogating the 
<br>
suspects after forcefully administering them mind-altering drugs. The 
<br>
Washington Post article quoted a former senior FBI official with a 
<br>
background in counter terrorism who distinguished the forced use of 
<br>
&quot;truth serum&quot; from beating a guy till he is senseless.
<br>
When the United States ratified the Convention Against Torture on 
<br>
October 21, 1994, it expressly acknowledged that torture includes the 
<br>
administration or application, or threatened administration or 
<br>
application, of mind altering substances or other procedures 
<br>
calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality.
<br>
<p>The bar on torture and forced drugging under the Convention Against 
<br>
Torture does not have a war time’ or suspected terrorist’ exemption, 
<br>
comments Boire, adding that Article 2 of the Convention states  &quot;No 
<br>
exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a 
<br>
threat of war, internal political in stability or any other public 
<br>
emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.&quot;
<br>
<p>The prospect of US law enforcement agents interrogating a person 
<br>
after injecting that person with a mind-altering drug is terrifying 
<br>
and grossly unconstitutional, says Boire. Under the Fifth Amendment 
<br>
there is no distinction between the use of physical force to obtain a 
<br>
statement and the compelled administration of a mind-altering drug to 
<br>
obtain a statement. Both techniques, notes Boire violate the firmly 
<br>
embedded constitutional guarantee against coerced confessions in 
<br>
which a suspect's will is overborne’ or the confession was not the 
<br>
product of a rational intellect and a free will.
<br>
<p>Condemning the use of drug-induced confessions, the US Supreme Court 
<br>
has stated, &quot;It is difficult to imagine a situation in which a 
<br>
confession would be less the product of a free intellect, less 
<br>
voluntary, than when brought about by a drug having the effect of a 
<br>
&quot;truth serum.&quot; (Townsend v. Sain (1963) 372 U.S. 293.) In another 
<br>
case, the Supreme Court cautioned, &quot;the blood of the accused is not 
<br>
the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.&quot; (Blackburn v. 
<br>
Alabama (1960) 361 U.S. 199, quoted in Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 
<br>
U.S. 436.)
<br>
The Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics calls upon federal 
<br>
authorities to respect the fundamental rights that are enshrined in 
<br>
the US Constitution and in the international conventions protecting 
<br>
human rights and prohibiting government-endorsed torture and mind 
<br>
manipulation. Under no circumstances are US government agents 
<br>
permitted to coerce statements through the use of physical 
<br>
intimidation or the forceful administration of mind-altering drugs. 
<br>
Use of such barbaric interrogation techniques is unlawful, says Boire 
<br>
, violates the basic human right to physical and mental autonomy, 
<br>
vitiates the presumption of innocence, and runs counter to the most 
<br>
fundamental and cherished of American freedoms and constitutional 
<br>
guarantees.
