PERUVIAN EXCELS IN ANALYZING ECONOMIES WORLDWIDE
<br>
by Georgie Anne Geyer
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.uexpress.com/georgieannegeyer/viewgg.cfm">http://www.uexpress.com/georgieannegeyer/viewgg.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON -- It may seem unlikely that a highly intellectual and unusual
<br>
Peruvian economist would have some of the long-term answers to terrorism in
<br>
the world. But Hernando de Soto, who has enlivened economic thinking and
<br>
challenged the misery of the developing world for several decades now, truly
<br>
has some original ideas.
<br>
<p>During his most recent visit to Washington, he and I had our third talk in
<br>
the past few months. Only this time, building on his years of contacts with
<br>
leaders and thinkers of the poorest countries of the globe, de Soto had just
<br>
come from three and a half hours with the head of a faded superpower,
<br>
Russian President Vladimir Putin.
<br>
<p>&quot;I told him that all capitalism is a legal framework,&quot; he said. &quot;If you get
<br>
it right, everything will fit together. But in fact, all countries start out
<br>
the same way. All countries start out with a black market -- until property
<br>
rights are established.
<br>
<p>&quot;So the first thing we do when we go into a country is 'measure it' and tell
<br>
the government where the problem is. It might be the mafias, because then
<br>
someone else is making the rules. We show them how to go from a black market
<br>
to a legal system.&quot;
<br>
<p>Was President Putin, the ex-KGB agent who has never been noted for his
<br>
economic prowess, willing or able to accept de Soto's formula? &quot;Putin was
<br>
terrific,&quot; de Soto said. &quot;He understands perfectly.
<br>
<p>&quot;I told him, 'I don't know Russia, but let me tell you throughout history
<br>
what Switzerland and Germany did to create a market economy. They did a very
<br>
sophisticated job of creating the proper kinds of laws and on agreeing on
<br>
who owns what.'
<br>
<p>&quot;When you talk with Putin and tell him that this is what the Germans did
<br>
decades ago, it begins to register. So Putin begins to realize that you're
<br>
saying the black market is not the result of the Russian soul, but it's like
<br>
smallpox: Everybody has had it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hernando de Soto works out of his Institute for Liberty and Democracy in his
<br>
hometown of Lima, Peru, an institute that has been the bete noir of
<br>
terrorists for years (the brutal Maoist Sendero Luminoso bombed the offices
<br>
in 1998, knowing full well where their enemy lay).
<br>
<p>But in the last six years, he and his staff have moved further afield,
<br>
across the underdeveloped world, into poverty-stricken countries or into
<br>
moderately developing countries that are falling behind because of
<br>
overpopulation. One of those, on both accounts, is Egypt.
<br>
<p>But, true to his insights into the economic life of societies, de Soto found
<br>
new facts to analyze in that teeming and increasingly troubled society.
<br>
Since Sept. 11, the government has been terrified by the &quot;Arab street&quot; from
<br>
taking a position on terrorism.
<br>
<p>&quot;In Egypt,&quot; he wrote in his new book, &quot;The Mystery of Capital,&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465016146/thefriedrhayeksc">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465016146/thefriedrhayeksc</a> &quot;the
<br>
wealth that the poor have accumulated is worth 55 times as much as the sum
<br>
of all direct foreign investment ever recorded there, including the Suez
<br>
Canal and the Aswan Dam.&quot; In fact, he was already, at the time of the
<br>
bombings, four and a half years into a five-year in-depth analysis of the
<br>
Egyptian economy, sponsored by President Hosni Mubarak.
<br>
<p>Going beyond Egypt, &quot;by our calculations, the total value of the real estate
<br>
held but not legally owned by the poor of the Third World and former
<br>
communist nations is at least $9.3 trillion,&quot; which is &quot;about twice as much
<br>
as the total circulating U.S. money supply,&quot; and &quot;very nearly as much as the
<br>
total value of all the companies listed on the main stock exchanges of the
<br>
world's 20 most developed countries.&quot;
<br>
<p>The trouble is that the &quot;mystery of capital,&quot; with its unique capacity to
<br>
regenerate societies by creating liberating wealth, never has the chance to
<br>
operate.
<br>
<p>As de Soto points out, this is because, whether in Egypt or Indonesia or for
<br>
that matter in George Washington's era in U.S. history, &quot;They have houses
<br>
but not titles, crops but not deeds, businesses but not statutes of
<br>
incorporation. And this is why many countries seem to be modern, but
<br>
aren't.&quot;
<br>
<p>They have adopted superficial products of capitalist society, but not the
<br>
&quot;representational forms&quot; underlying capitalist societies and freeing capital
<br>
in a &quot;vast hidden process that connects all the assets to the rest of the
<br>
economy&quot; and gives them a &quot;parallel life in the creation of new assets.&quot;
<br>
<p>Painfully little of this complex but creative -- and comfortably
<br>
quantifiable -- process is present today in the Arab and Islamic world
<br>
(whose banks spurn interest, for example). Only 4 percent of the investment
<br>
moneys of the world go into the Middle East, including Israel. No wonder,
<br>
then, that teams of violent youth haunt the mountains of Afghanistan and the
<br>
streets of Cairo and Djakarta.
<br>
<p>Not much can be done, of course, in terms of the economic reconstruction of
<br>
developing countries while this &quot;war on terrorism&quot; is at its height. But in
<br>
the long run, if the countries of the world are to stabilize, the original
<br>
and practical ideas of this remarkable thinker are surely the place to
<br>
begin.
