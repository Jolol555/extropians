<em>&gt; It depends what you mean by &quot;monitor&quot;.  Computers are cheap and

</em><br>
<p>True.  But, as the saying goes, there's information and then there's
<br>
knowledge.  The latter requires human (or at least sentient, but *right
<br>
now* and for the immediate future that means &quot;human&quot;) comprehension of
<br>
the former in order to make use of and act on it, in ways that are
<br>
obvious once you have the information but which are, in general too
<br>
complex to economically predict every single method.  (Though software
<br>
is slowly getting better at this task.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The government scans my passport every time I enter the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so they must have a record of all of my entries.  The airlines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a record of all of my exits.  Why can't this information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be tied together such that the border crossings can be matched?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Particularly for non-U.S. citizens!)  VISAs are issued for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicit periods and specific purposes.  I see no reason why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when people overstay VISAs red flags should not go off to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause the start of an investigation.
</em><br>
<p>One overwhelming reason: the number of cases they already know about -
<br>
even without this scanning - *far* exceeds the manpower available to
<br>
investigate.  The obvious solution, hire more people, requires money
<br>
they just don't have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we are going to have to develop better methods for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determining when someone represents a threat and implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>This, I'll grant.  If we could develop better rules, we could turn
<br>
those rules over to non-sentient machines available today, and the
<br>
problem might go away (or, at least, significantly diminish).  Then
<br>
again, developing these better methods and rules is easier said than
<br>
done, at least without catching so many innocents in the net that
<br>
sorting them out and compensating for the inconvenience makes the system
<br>
actually more expensive than what we have now.  (Some citizens
<br>
require a *lot* of pacification: since they're innocent and honest and
<br>
catching them was entirely the government's mistake, they use the
<br>
opportunity to squeeze for every apologetic cent and benny they can
<br>
muster.)
