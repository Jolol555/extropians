<em>&gt; I know there is a previous thread on this, but I can't find it, so if
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What degree of cultural engineering is necessary or desirable in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we be satisfied merely with a government that no longer gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe harbor to Al Quaida? Or should we strive for more, like respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for free speech, privacy, elected and accountable government, equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection under the law (in particular, equal rights for women)?
</em><br>
<p>As laudable as these things are, we have absolutely no right to
<br>
impose any system of government on Afghanistan or any other
<br>
country.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we opt for the latter, are we being cultural imperialists, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is blatantly not consistant with their way of life, particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last item? In such cases, is it necessarily wrong to be a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Force is force.  It would be meaningless for these things to be
<br>
imposed rather than coming from the people themselves.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; NOTE: Spike &amp; Mike &amp; Co., please hold your fire. I already know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your take on this is, and it's not without merit, but this question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly addressed to the Doves. I still want to know what's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important, human rights or the Prime Directive, and maybe this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll get an answer.
</em><br>
<p>What is important is ending the current violence and creating to
<br>
the extent possible, starting from what is already present, an
<br>
environment that a more civil and healthy country may grow out
<br>
of.  What is most needful is to create a process for the
<br>
resolution of conflict that does not depend on violence and the
<br>
forceful imposition of religious or other dictates on the entire
<br>
population.  I don't know if there is space to fully get there
<br>
or how close it is possible to get.  What won't happen is that
<br>
Afghanistan will not become like a little US culturally or
<br>
politically any time soon.  I don't think it would be terribly
<br>
good if it did.
