<p>Here is the URL in the archives for my original post (on April 30)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q01/3404.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q01/3404.html</a>

<p>I *believe* that the bills may be tabled for this session of
<br>
congress -- but you never know with those slippery politicians.
<br>
They will most likely get reintroduced next session.  Whether the
<br>
numbers will change or not -- I don't know.  (I'm assuming that
<br>
these would have to be voted on again in the next congress???)
<br>
<p>Please carefully note the (a), (b) and (c) points (and review
<br>
the bills yourself for greater clarity).  While it arguably
<br>
might be nice to prevent any regulation in this area (I
<br>
perhaps can make an argument that allowing [unreliable]
<br>
reproductive experiments is unextropic).  To be pragmatic
<br>
you may wish to focus on aspects related to primary extropian
<br>
agendas, i.e. (c) use of 'cloning' processes to produce human
<br>
tissues or organs.
<br>
<p>Specifically you would want to argue that the use of human
<br>
eggs, DNA, cells, etc. for the purpose of developing stem
<br>
cells that may be used for tissue repair purposes *should*
<br>
be allowed.  I think they tried to get this changed in the
<br>
House bill and failed.  Lets hope the Senate is more rational.
<br>
<p>You can expect the Biotechnology Industry and perhaps Pharma
<br>
industries to be behind us on this one.  It doesn't hurt
<br>
to remind the politicians that while this industry is small
<br>
now, it has the potential to grow to billions of dollars per
<br>
year, perhaps even hundreds of billions of dollars ultimately.
<br>
Denying U.S. scientists the right to work in these areas
<br>
doesn't stop it -- it simply moves it to offshore countries
<br>
that are a bit more rational and probably results in a brain
<br>
drain of talented scientists from the U.S. (for a change).
