<em>&gt; &gt; The problem isn't your philosophical system, it's mine, and in mine

<em>&gt; &gt; These acts took place within the borders of the continental U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and by our standards and laws they are both cowardly and criminal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But by our standards, when the CIA with little or no oversight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and using secret funds goes to various countries and topples
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their elected governments using a variety of means including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those which cannot be termed other than terrorism, torture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assasination, sabotage and so on - is this somehow not criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but a reasonable function of the government?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seems to me there is a bit of a double standard here. As bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as WTC was we have been involved in covert operations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries we were not at war with, even in countries we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposedly friends with that are every bit as horrendous. Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of our secret operations resulted in much higher loss of life

<em>&gt;and property. Does it enter into anyone's head along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chest-beating righteous anger that some of the anger and venom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;directed toward us is not without cause? Do we understand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our rhetoric is roundly condemning as utterly beyond the pall
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions that portions of our own government have committed, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;committing and plan now to commit even more egregiously? Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of what is proposed as curative would include a variety of even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more ambitious covert activities around the world and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within our own borders by some of these same players and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undesirables they may see fit to influence, use or recruit.
</em><br>
<p>Well said, Samantha.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Have we learned a damn thing from the history of using such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;methods?
</em><br>
<p>Apparently, and unfortunately, not.  The U.S. has declared for itself a 
<br>
&quot;righteous war&quot; to prevent from having to ask itself the questions you so 
<br>
eloquently asked above.  And it looks as though it has convinced the 
<br>
American people to do the same.
<br>
<p>I say again....What an absolute, damn waste.  lnnocent lives lost for 
<br>
nothing.  An unaffordable lesson paid for dearly, but not learned.  And 
<br>
yes, even an enemy can teach you something.
<br>
<p>A changed world alright, but will it be an improved one?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does anything seem a bit cockeyed about this sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;solution&quot;?

<p>Which is why I've taken a break from posting here recently.  I'm getting 
<br>
the feeling my return was premature.
<br>
<p>Take care,

<p>&quot;What you do unto others, you do unto yourself&quot;

<p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
