<p>Harvey or E!Shaun or somebody FAQ-worthy ought to create a numeric index for this sort of
<br>
commentary--this one's root would be a low single digit. I'm picking 5 arbitrarily for this post.
<br>
<p>Hmm. Well, let's think of possibilities. Ah! Here's one!
<br>
--Current events shunted you to a next-door universe where people's
<br>
circles of concern contracted as their circles of influence failed
<br>
to expand?
<br>
<p>Or...
<br>
--A decade ago we were all a decade younger?
<br>
<p><p>Or...
<br>
--We are acting like threatened social creatures because that's what we evolved as, and there's a fresh stressor in
<br>
effect?
<br>
<p>Let's all play the &quot;why aren't we having fun?&quot; game! It's...
<br>
well, it isn't fun, actually.
<br>
<p>There are still a few (less strident than others, and less prolific) voices
<br>
that sound like that old list is reported to have sounded. If the 
<br>
list constituency is less like-minded, or less firebreathing, gee
<br>
whiz. Blame regression to a mean, or fatigue, or diaspora, or anything.
<br>
Anders seems to be doing OK, and Mr. Bradbury has been no slouch overall.
<br>
<p>And me? I already said I was too &quot;Neg&quot; to be on this list.
