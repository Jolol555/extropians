</em><br>
<p>I likewise read Erich von Daniken's &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; when I was a
<br>
youth.  I actually looked in the bibliography and sought out the sources so
<br>
that I could examine them for myself.  What I found was that von Daniken
<br>
deliberately misstated data and deliberately quoted items out of context.
<br>
The original quotes clearly did not say what von Daniken made them seem to
<br>
say.
<br>
<p>My second similar experience was with a well-known science popularizer who
<br>
wrote about real science.  He wrote one book that included a scientific
<br>
mystery.  A particular equation fit older data, but failed with more recent
<br>
data.  By working backwards from the known data, I was able to adapt the
<br>
equations to fit all known data.  At the age of 14, I wrote the author
<br>
thinking I has solved some sort of scientific mystery.  His response was
<br>
that the book was written for money only.  He really wasn't sure if this big
<br>
mystery really existed, nor was he interested in actually trying to solve
<br>
any scientific riddles.  He was a writer only, and not really a scientist.
<br>
<p>These two events definitely shaped my later skepticism in my adult life.
