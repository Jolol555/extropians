<em>&gt; Here is an interesting article by an Antropology professor at Rutgers:

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It points out one of the fundamental problems the hording of women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the Islamic wealthy so the young poor men have few alternatives but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go to war.  Not that I'm against &quot;Islam&quot; per se, but this is a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem that is built into the religion (like any priciples against interest)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Antropologists believe that lack of food or mates are the only two things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can sufficiently motivate men to &quot;go to war&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excerpts:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Will the situation change? There are countless young men in poor &quot;states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of concern&quot; whose only plausible luxury may lie in the symbolic realm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral and theological triumph. They are likely, at best, to have to scrape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out a minimally tolerable existence that pales beside the images of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sensual and material peril - America! America! - their leaders seek to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hide from them but cannot. &quot;The Great Satan&quot; strictly translated is &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; great tempter&quot;. A select few, perhaps the most angry or lonely, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the most pious or theoretical, will decide not to try to become part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; America or its way of life but to destroy it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; American and other forces will have to find, confront, and destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something new. They may well succeed in rooting out at least the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overt groups. But the much larger and longer-term problem for us and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world at large - that there are millions upon millions of these young men,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not just Bin Laden's thousands - will finally have to be faced by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently feckless leaders of the grim societies that have produced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nurtured such wild theological pathologies.
</em><br>
<p>This is rather biased and I believe, quite inaccurate.  The real
<br>
situation is not at all similar to this.  When I was in the area
<br>
I did not notice nor hear of young men being unable to find
<br>
wives.  It also tends to continue the trend of putting the blame
<br>
for the entire situation on &quot;them&quot; and more or less exonerating
<br>
or at least ignoring &quot;us&quot;.  This is common tactically in times
<br>
of conflict.  But it is no less annoying, biased and likely to
<br>
lead to poor decisions if not balanced out.
<br>
<p>They are all male because the most fundamentalist sects and, in
<br>
some countries, the soceity in general, only support males doing
<br>
much of anything publicly and especially acts of war and
<br>
revenge.  This is very old and typical of humans and human
<br>
battles as it is of many of our primate cousins.  We ourselves
<br>
only let males have combat roles for much of our history.  So
<br>
what?  Most of the points of the article could be applied to any
<br>
elite battle group or special forces almost anywhere in the
<br>
world and throughout history.  The article is useless as
<br>
purported explanation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And here is an article that suggests we are partially in our current boat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we have failed to follow 20 year old recomendations about reducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our dependence on foreign oil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.gristmagazine.com/grist/imho/imho101101.asp">http://www.gristmagazine.com/grist/imho/imho101101.asp</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, Samantha, worth your time to read as the article points out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bin Laden *pays* the families of individuals who commit suicide for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that is not the main important point of that article
<br>
at all.  It is not uncommon for any society or group to take
<br>
care of the surviving depends (to some degree) of its dead
<br>
soliders.  
<br>
<p>What is good about the article is that it makes the point that
<br>
such attacks as 911 are an adaptation to be able to strike at a
<br>
much more powerful foe at all.  This is important to point out
<br>
as we bluster about using such &quot;cowardly&quot; means.  It is also
<br>
important to point out that the adaptation of means is certainly
<br>
not over and that we are vulnerable and cannot remove all the
<br>
means we are without destroying much that we value highly. 
<br>
<p>It is also good to point out that most Americans are ignorant
<br>
bystanders of the forces involved.  It would be quite beneficial
<br>
to understand much more deeply both &quot;sides&quot; of the conflict. 
<br>
Facile and biased interpretations will not help us.  
<br>
<p>Reducing dependence on nuclear energy makes no sense at all. 
<br>
Without it we will not replace dependence on mid east oil.  And
<br>
nuclear plants are much more centralized and easier to defend.  
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; And a commentary on the need for &quot;mimetic&quot; engineering:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlikely Doves: Counter-terrorism Experts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Corn, AlterNet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=11601">http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=11601</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only thing I tought a bit far-fetched was this quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nanomachines that can invade the circulatory system and effect the brain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought patterns of the target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not anytime in the near future....
</em><br>
<p>True and such invasion would be the ultimate act of violence and
<br>
force.
<br>
<p>The article had a lot of good points.  But I don't believe it
<br>
goes far enough in acknowledge the righteous reasons that much
<br>
of the Middle East is angry toward the US.  Great powers DO
<br>
manipulate the governments of the region.  This is not a mere
<br>
belief.  We have done a large and often quite smelly share of
<br>
the manipulating.  Many of the people of the region have ample
<br>
reason not to trust us.  That is going to be difficult to
<br>
overcome.
<br>
<p>I am very glad the article points out the empty effect of our
<br>
public rhetoric about this &quot;war&quot; on the roots of the anger in
<br>
the region. 
<br>
<p>The stuff by &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter is truly bizarre.  I do not consider
<br>
this creature a friend and I am amazed and mightily discouraged
<br>
that he has the ear of anyone with any power at all. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In response to Samantha's question regarding &quot;fatwas&quot;, a &quot;fatwa&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a religious ruling by someone with &quot;authority&quot;.  The problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam, and many other religions with the possible exceptions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhism and Catholicism, is that there is no &quot;supreme authority&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam, like evangelical christianity, seems to have a book which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be interpreted in many different ways.  So &quot;fatwas&quot; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go many ways from &quot;Islam is a peaceful religion&quot; to &quot;Killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infidels in the name of Allah is what Islamics should do&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>There is no &quot;supreme authority&quot; in Buddhism or even in but one
<br>
variant of Catholicism.  A fatwa is a relgiously inspired
<br>
judicial decision.  Again, a fatwa demanding the execution of an
<br>
outsider much less a citizen of another country, is a rare
<br>
exception and actually meaningless within the context of the
<br>
range and legitimacy of fatwa as I understand it.   A blanket
<br>
statement of killing all &quot;infidels&quot; has absolutely nothing to do
<br>
with fatwa and neither does a pronoucement on Islam being a
<br>
peaceful religion.  This is the equivalent of claiming a
<br>
pronoucement by a local judge determines the goodness of our
<br>
foreign policy or of our culture or can set us to destroying all
<br>
who are not American. It is an outrageous and meaningless claim
<br>
in both cultures.
