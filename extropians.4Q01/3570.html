Hello Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Could you explain to me in some detail what this post meant?  I am not familiar with the axiom of choice, or Godwin's law.  And even if I were, I'm not sure I would fully grasp what you are trying to say.  On cryonet this subject is once again a central thread.  
<br>
<p>Yesterday, at a local college I attended a new business fair.  A local Alaskan doctor named Brett Butler has launched his own biotech start-up, Microbion, to bring a new generation of disinfecting agents to market.  He has an impressive list of doctors and researchers in league with him.
<br>
<p>I told Max, Robert and Greg about his company.  They may be able to help him out.  And when his company goes public, they may want to invest in it also.  As you might too, of course, but would be a year or two away at least.  
<br>
<p>He does not yet have a website up, but his email address is <a href="mailto:microbioncorp@alaskalife.net?Subject=Re:%20Hello%20from%20John%20in%20Alaska&In-Reply-To=&lt;HHCJCOJPNKFJHAAA@mailcity.com&gt;">microbioncorp@alaskalife.net</a>   
<br>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to share this with you.  With your new income I suppose you keep an eye out for possible investments.
<br>
<p>I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving.  I spent mine with a friend's extended family.  This family has two lawyers and a dentist in it.  lol  The other dinner guest was a retired federal agent who told us some enthralling(and declassified!) stories from his career.    
<br>
<p>take care,
<br>
<p>John
