<em>&gt; I always find this metaphor unsatisfying. Particularly because, even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might believe that we could create conscious intelligence from parts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those parts might not be in the form of a von-neumann computer. It may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case that there are some quite stringent restrictions on the substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for intelligence+consciousness, including stopping/restarting, wholesale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copying around in memory (or whatever persistence mechanism was to be used),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. There might be restrictions which entirely preclude running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness on a suped-up Pentium.
</em><br>
<p>It's a general principle of computer science that all computers are
<br>
equivalent in their expressive power.  What one computer can do, another
<br>
computer can simulate.
<br>
<p>If it turned out that certain kinds of computers couldn't run conscious
<br>
programs but others could, that would invalidate this thesis.  It would
<br>
mean that there were physical systems which could not be simulated by
<br>
conventional computers, that there is fundamentally more to the universe
<br>
than can be expressed by algorithmic modelling.
<br>
<p>It's always possible that this may turn out to be true, but so far there
<br>
is no evidence of it.  Even quantum systems can be simulated to any
<br>
desired degree of precision.  And as far as we know the brain uses no
<br>
&quot;magic physics,&quot; which this result would require.
<br>
<p>So if it does turn out that consciousness is non-physical or cannot be
<br>
simulated by a computer, that will be contrary to all of our experience
<br>
and scientific understanding of the world.  It will certainly be a
<br>
surprising result.
