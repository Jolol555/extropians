<em>&gt;     &gt;You are right, as far as you go.  But I think the phrase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;doesn't matter&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;is incomplete. It doesn't matter &quot;for some purposes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand. If it doesn't matter objectify and it doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectively where exactly does it matter?
</em><br>
<p>It does matter for some purpose and not others.  You cut out my list of
<br>
where it matters and where it doesn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;The way I know that I am not my twin is that I am inside a body I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;call &quot;me&quot; here.  My brother is in a similar body over there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I can never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;confuse the person &quot;here&quot; with the person &quot;there&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure you can, all I'd have to do is swap sensory inputs with your copy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd get very confused very fast.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree.  This fits in with my position.  Duplicating the atoms doesn’t
<br>
cause a shared reality or a coexistence as the same person.  Now you are
<br>
proposing that there must be a communications between the two so that
<br>
thoughts and sensory input are exchanged.  Now I would begin to think that
<br>
the two minds linked together might have a chance of becoming a single mind.
<br>
Before that communications link is established, the original consciousness
<br>
remains in the original body and the newly created consciousness always
<br>
remains in the newly created body.  The copy operation does not change or
<br>
relocate the original.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think asking for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position in space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where &quot;you&quot; exists is meaningful, it's like asking for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coordinates of &quot;fast&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;red&quot;, but if you do have a position it would be where your sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transducers are.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  As long as my sensory input is coming from a single body, that’s
<br>
the body that I perceive as me.  Perception equals sensory input.  I can’t
<br>
experience anything but the sensory stream being fed to me.  Arguing that a
<br>
copy is me when I can’t experience that person doesn’t satisfy my experience
<br>
of being me.  If I can see through those eyes, control that body, think
<br>
thoughts with that brain, then that person seems to be me.  Until these
<br>
sensory inputs are connected, I am “disconnected” from that person.
<br>
<p>Connectivity defines where the boundary of the self lies.  What I can access
<br>
is “me”.  What I cannot access is outside of me.  My skin feels like “me”.
<br>
My hair does not feel like “me” and can be discarded.  If my head is severed
<br>
from my body, the body is no longer part of me.  I think everything boils
<br>
down to where I perceive myself to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The position of your brain is irrelevant as long as it's not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far away that time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delay becomes important.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  However, if my brain is in one place and my sensory inputs are
<br>
somewhere else, it takes both functioning locations to keep me supplied with
<br>
a perception of being there.  If the sensory input is destroyed OR if the
<br>
brain is destroyed OR if the communications link is destroyed, the
<br>
perception of being somewhere else is lost.  As long as this illusion can be
<br>
maintained, it is subjectively as if I am at the location of the sensory
<br>
input.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;Internally, each copy can easily distinguish itself from the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How? How would you feel differently if I'd killed the original last night
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you are the copy? How would you even know it had happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I didn't tell you?
</em><br>
<p>You are confusing this statement:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copies can always tell themselves apart.
<br>
<p>with this statement:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copies can tell which was the original and which was the recreation.
<br>
<p>The former statement is true and is what I claim.  The latter statement is
<br>
false and is what you are arguing against.  However, given these two
<br>
statements, each copy would prefer that his own local self survive over the
<br>
remote other self.
