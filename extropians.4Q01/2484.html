I seem to recall that MRI (nee NMI) is the granddady of the field--no ionizing radiation, but rather slow and as a
<br>
consequence somewhat blurry, depending on how rigidly one can bench the scanned part(s). 
<br>
<p>Your basic CT (nee CAT) scan is usually done with a big slowly-rotating radiation source, IIRC, and can sometimes reveal
<br>
more information but at the cost of a dose of gamma. 
<br>
<p>You might want to check out EBT (electron beam tomography, also known as EBCT); there are various tradeoffs. 
<br>
www.heartscan.com  is an interesting place to look; were you to email them, they might give you answers. The biggest
<br>
payoff in using EBT is for tissues that are hard to image because they are floppy or squishy and move: hearts, other
<br>
chest and abdominal organs, and possibly CNS.
<br>
<p>Reading between the lines at www.heartscan.com,
<br>
<p>Time: I'd guess a head-to-toe baseline EBT scan shouldn't take more than two hours, and perhaps as little as one hour.
<br>
That's including the initial quick look to confirm a good picture. They offer you a CD of the imaging, but I assume it's
<br>
POVrayed (or whatever) and lower res than the collected data. So I'd guess the actual data is gigabytes, but I don't
<br>
feel like doing a back-of-the-envelope that might be off by three orders of magnitude :).
<br>
<p>Resolution: Again, using EBT, it appears to me that sub-millimeter features can be routinely detected. I don't know if
<br>
the raw collected data is .3, .2, or .1 millimter, or what.
<br>
<p>By the bye, googling  tomography  gets one lots of interesting links.
