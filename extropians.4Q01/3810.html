<p>
I don't know if the list has fallen to virus attacks but
<br>
following up on Michael's note, I'm offering up:
<br>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/SciTech/reuters20011205_211.html">http://abcnews.go.com/wire/SciTech/reuters20011205_211.html</a>
<br>
<p>Also, at least one extropian accidentally propagated the
<br>
WORM_BADTRANS.B Virus on Monday.  See:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/w32badtransb.html">http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/w32badtransb.html</a>
<br>
<p>I wasn't infected because I don't have #*!&amp;%#* MS Outlook
<br>
on my machine -- even though I *stupidly* transferred the
<br>
attachment from UNIX to Windows and clicked on the file.
<br>
I mean, after all, you can trust attachments from Extropians
<br>
can't you?
<br>
<p>At any rate, anyone else who is an extropian might also be
<br>
getting attacked by this and so be *very* careful of incoming
<br>
messages.  The message was ~45K in size, had no subject line
<br>
and the attachment was Pics.DOC.scr (but it can apparently have
<br>
different names).  I think this is one of the more insidious
<br>
viruses since you don't have to do much to forward it apparently.
<br>
Also beware the sources of these are starting to use things like
<br>
AIM to forward the viruses as well.
<br>
<p>I hearby request that *ANYONE* on the list who uses Microsoft
<br>
Outlook as their email program and who happens to have my email
<br>
address in their Address Book *PLEASE* REMOVE it.
<br>
<p>I'd also recommend that if you know anyone who uses MS Outlook
<br>
and you are in *their* address book that you get yourself
<br>
removed from it.  The lesson to be learned here is that
<br>
you are only as safe as &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;.  If you need
<br>
my address (or other addresses of extropians) make up
<br>
an HTML file with &quot;mailto:&quot; URLs in it and then put it
<br>
someplace obscure in your directory structure -- not
<br>
&quot;My Documents&quot; -- since the viruses are clever enough
<br>
now to scan that for more email addresses.  If you
<br>
want to really help protect us encrypt the file because
<br>
its only a matter of time before the viruses will scan
<br>
every file on the machine looking for email addresses.
<br>
<p>Also, as a &quot;heads up&quot; -- the Love Bug cost an estimated
<br>
$8.75 Billion (~= 50% of the NIH Budget) in losses.
<br>
Do your part to be part of the solution and not part
<br>
of the problem.
<br>
<p>Robert
