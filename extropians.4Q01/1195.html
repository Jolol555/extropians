UCAV = Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle
<br>
<p>First use of armed drones heralds 'revolution' in warfare
<br>
Waging war by remote control
<br>

<br>
Oct. 18 - The United States is for the first time flying armed, unmanned
<br>
aircraft into combat and controlling them with operators in the United States
<br>
thousands of miles from the battlefield in Afghanistan, Defense Department
<br>
officials said yesterday.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE USE of the armed RQ-1 Predators is a revolutionary step in the
<br>
conduct of warfare. The slow-moving, propeller-driven aircraft have been flown
<br>
by the Air Force for six years to gather intelligence, most recently in combat
<br>
during the Kosovo war in 1999. But now the Air Force has outfitted them with
<br>
Hellfire antitank missiles, powerful weapons usually carried on helicopters,
<br>
the officials said.
<br>
Not much is known about how the armed Predators have been used in Afghanistan,
<br>
but a government official said they have fired their missiles several times.
<br>
The attacks by the Predators mark a turning point in military history because
<br>
they signal that the Air Force is now able to survey and then shoot at ground
<br>
positions from lower altitudes without putting pilots at risk.
<br>
<p>EXTENDING REACH, FLEXIBILITY
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armed drones also give the military enormous reach and flexibility,
<br>
creating the real possibility that the United States could someday fly combat
<br>
missions without having to put large numbers of military personnel on nearby
<br>
land bases or aircraft carriers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military strategists said the Bush administration's war on terrorism
<br>
could lead to the use of additional new technologies and methods, some of them
<br>
still secret.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think this war is going to give you a revolution in military
<br>
affairs,&quot; said Eliot Cohen, an expert in military strategy at Johns Hopkins
<br>
University.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Force is also believed, for example, to be trying to weaponize
<br>
the RQ-4A Global Hawk, a much longer-range unmanned surveillance aircraft that
<br>
might eventually be able to carry weapons from the continental United States
<br>
to targets around the world. In April, the craft - which has a longer wingspan
<br>
than a Boeing 737 - flew 8,600 miles from California to Australia.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predators are usually operated by the Air Force. But in the Afghanistan
<br>
conflict, the day-to-day operation has been handled by the Central
<br>
Intelligence Agency because of its ongoing effort tracking suspected terrorist
<br>
Osama bin Laden, according to a source familiar with the operation. After the
<br>
Predators take off, control is turned over to Air Force personnel in the
<br>
United States. In case the satellite link is lost, the CIA has backup
<br>
operators standing by to take over control.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The more bouncing you have to do off of satellites and relay stations,
<br>
the more potential trouble you have to prepare for,&quot; one official said.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
