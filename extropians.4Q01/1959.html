<p>Interesting article about one of the emerging problems facing the British 
<br>
Prime Minister.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;'My allegiance is to Allah'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No-one should be surprised by reports that young Muslim men from Britain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have died in Afghanistan
</em><br>
<p>Some interesting comments from some Luton-based Muslims;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Although their opinions are not representative of all Muslims, they would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frighten most of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One said: &quot;Whenever Muslims are under attack I will always fight for them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I will always give my life and want to give my life. &quot;
</em><br>
<p>Given that the U.K. has in recent times experienced serious race-relations 
<br>
problems culminating in the Oldham riots, this can only add to an already 
<br>
tense situation.
<br>
<p>I've also been reading many of the &quot;Opinion&quot; items published on the Irish 
<br>
Times website since 911.  They have articles from those on both sides of 
<br>
&quot;the fence&quot;.  For those who are inclined, a browse through their archives 
<br>
gives an interesting &quot;external&quot; perspective.

<p><p><p><p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
