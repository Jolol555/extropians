<em>&gt; &gt; Once again, Samantha talking out her ear. She obviously has absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no idea what the meaning of the term 'unlimited war' is. The US air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; campaign is the definition of limited war. NPR and others have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interviewed afghanis who have expressed amazement that they are able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; go about their daily business all over afghanistan, that the US attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are so focused on specific military targets of the Taliban and al Qaeda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they really have little to worry about from the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once again you don't know what you are talking about.  Bush has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly stated that there are no limits to his notion of the war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until all terrorist groups and their adherents are exposed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminated in however many countries they may be in or supported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by especially in the Middle East.  The above is nonsense when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of thousand are fleeing the country and some 7 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people might well starve to death if food is not brought in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the onset of winter.
</em><br>
<p>If anybody dies in Afghanistan, it is either because the Taliban refuse
<br>
to let in aid trucks, or because the knobby kneed wimps at the aid
<br>
groups are too chicken to transport aid. If you are driving an aid
<br>
convoy, you only need to transmit your position to US force to make sure
<br>
they are aware of your presence. We are executing a very surgical
<br>
campaign, and anyone that is fleeing does so only because they are
<br>
either the bad guys, or they beleive the BS the bad guys spout out. I
<br>
see that this doesn't exclude the gullible in the west as well...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
