<p>&lt;snippity doo dah&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you had &quot;real-time&quot; backup capability (say via a very high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bandwidth radio connection [Kurzweil has argued this but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doubt it is feasible...]), then you will notice a hallucinatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;type &quot;break&quot; in your consciousness. One minute you can hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the WTC collapsing on top of you and you probably notice this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;huge sensory overload and the next minute you find yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;waking up in a hospital room (again -- probably suspecting you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a copy). Of course if the technology is good enough you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rollback to prior to the plane impacts and rewrite the script
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from that point forward. You just don't have anyplace to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to work the next day and you might have to give the eulogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at your funeral. :-) That is assuming you have a spare
</em><br>
<em>&gt;body around that you can be downloaded into -- otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you will have to attend virtually until a clone can be grown.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that gives me an idea for a punishment for the perpetrators of 
<br>
the crime, assuming they survived/uploaded etc.. (especially effective if 
<br>
the criminals are unfamiliar with the uploading/downloading concept to 
<br>
begin with).  Implant a mind storage device into their brains and download 
<br>
into it the minds of however many victims there were.  Allow these minds 
<br>
access to his aural and visual senses.  The killer will have to live with 
<br>
the screams and taunts of his victims, his own thoughts being &quot;deafened&quot; by 
<br>
the wail of a thousand voices, seeing (perhaps even feeling) their deaths 
<br>
over and over forever, or at least until he goes insane.  Definitely _not_ 
<br>
the paradise he would be expecting.
<br>
<p>Yeah, I guess I've got a cruel streak in there somewhere....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Any *really* good technology would theoretically allow you to shift
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you consciousness back and forth at will (from wetware to alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hardware). It may however be the case that that proves technically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too difficult and you only get to make backups when you plug yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into a &quot;Matrix&quot; type fiber bundle when you go to sleep each night.
</em><br>
<p>I'm writing (sorry, procrastinating on) a story (inspired by Colm, who 
<br>
sometimes posts here) in which there's a bit of this switching going 
<br>
on.  It's the only way to travel, really :)  I wonder if this ability would 
<br>
give one the feeling of having a &quot;wider&quot; consciousness, the kind you get 
<br>
when watching a movie that has many scene changes.  Might be disconcerting 
<br>
to a non-enhanced human, although if you can pass the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; test 
<br>
then you'd probably be ok.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p><p><p>James....
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
