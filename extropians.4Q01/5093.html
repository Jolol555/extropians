</em><br>
<p>The essay left much to be desired but I did not choose to take
<br>
it apart then or now so let us leave that.  I think that it is
<br>
judgemental in the extreme and dangerous to claim that we can
<br>
tell which cultures and people will have nothing at all to
<br>
contribute to the fture we dream of.  Many here have very
<br>
limited (in my view) ideas about what is and is not of value in
<br>
human cultures.  Let us see these things work out for themselves
<br>
as we do what we can to spread the benefits of the expanding
<br>
capabilities and knowledge to all.   People are not utterly
<br>
stuck with only their current mindsets from their current
<br>
culture.  Given a bit of opportunity, many people change and
<br>
grow.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropianism, will follow on their own path of development decades or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centuries after the West and that we cannot guarantee that they will also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifted by the technological tsunami.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't accept calling these people &quot;luddites&quot; or any other
<br>
depracatory term.  They are our siblings and we can, if we will
<br>
it, do much to benefit both them and ourselves in ways that will
<br>
maximize our (all of our) growth into our full potential.   By
<br>
the nature of what is coming all people will be affected unless
<br>
we create virtual or actual enclaves.  Some may choose such if
<br>
they have a choice.  But we need to assure that no one chooses
<br>
for others as much as possible.
