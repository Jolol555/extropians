(<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html</a>)
<br>
I scored 40.
<br>
<p>However, I think the test is truly ridiculous!  I understand that the test
<br>
is taken as a whole, that each question can be answered incorrectly (that
<br>
is, against any condition you have) because of some other factor.  My
<br>
question is, what kind of profiles can score highly on this test yet not
<br>
be autistic or have Asperger's?  What kind of profile can score low on
<br>
this test and be autistic? &quot;Eighty percent of those diagnosed with autism
<br>
or a related disorder scored 32 or higher.&quot;  Sounds to me like 20% fell
<br>
through the cracks!  Why!
<br>
<p>Let's examine some of the questions:
<br>
<p>3. If I try to imagine something, I find it very easy to create a picture in
<br>
my mind. 
<br>
<p>Yes, I can imagine what the front door of my house looks like.  I can also
<br>
create an imaginary world and write a story about it.  But compared to
<br>
what?  Compared to my ability to envision, say, the path of execution down
<br>
a recursive procedure tree, or a theoretical inheritance graph while
<br>
designing a complex system of classes?  Compared to that, I'm practically
<br>
blind!  I answered &quot;Agree&quot; to this one.  (There are only two choices for
<br>
each question, probably standard practice but I'm behind in my study of
<br>
psychology methodology).
<br>
<p>5. I often notice small sounds when others do not.
<br>
<p>Is this a question on hearing, information theory, or signal processing?  
<br>
&quot;Small&quot; in amplitude or &quot;small&quot; because most people don't think the sound
<br>
is important?  I can hear sounds coming out of an engine that many people
<br>
don't seem to hear.  Or is it my description of the sound and their
<br>
resulting attempt to hear what I'm hearing (where my description is not
<br>
good) that is causing me to think this?  Or maybe I'm delusional and
<br>
always hear/see patterns where there are none?  Or are they perhaps
<br>
referring to high frequency, such as the buzz of a television set? (Drives
<br>
me nuts.)  How is any person not equipped with a laboratory and a slew of
<br>
willing volunteers supposed to answer this question objectively?
<br>
<p>13.  I would rather go to a library than to a party.
<br>
<p>Perhaps because parties are a waste of time?  Sometimes I like to head out
<br>
to the odd party.. but only because it's a challenging mental game.  Over
<br>
the years I've managed to build up quite a good set of rules for dealing
<br>
with parties, and usually manage to go to clubs or parties and fit
<br>
in.  What if my set of rules becomes so rich that I enjoy parties?  What
<br>
if I dislike libraries and parties?
<br>
<p>35. I am often the last to understand the point of a joke.
<br>
<p>Hold on here.. jokes are a way of playing on cultural context.  If you
<br>
grew up outside of the &quot;normal&quot; culture (as I did, being discriminated
<br>
by (other) parents and teachers because my mother has always been
<br>
single) then it is only natural that one might not get most jokes.
<br>
<p>I'm not claiming that the test is bogus (after all, I scored high, maybe I
<br>
really am abnormal along with the other 95% of the population), but I
<br>
would like to hear some informed feedback on how people think the test
<br>
stands up against a rigorous logical dissection.  What kind of delusion
<br>
does someone need to score high or low, and be placed in the wrong
<br>
category by this test?  (Heck, maybe even asking this question puts me in
<br>
the &quot;autistic&quot; category, but if that's true, humanity is in serious need
<br>
of more autistic people.)
<br>
<p>Someday psychologists will discover that there is no normal.  Then it's a
<br>
not-so-simple matter of letting the rest of the world know.
