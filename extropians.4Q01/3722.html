<br>
<p>&quot;I believe that if the copy has all your thoughts and experiences, and
<br>
a continuity of consciousness, then he (not it) feels like &quot; the
<br>
original you&quot; has perceived a waking up sensation. I would say that
<br>
this statement is identical to &quot;the original me perceives a waking up
<br>
sensation&quot;.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I dont see how you can logically say a copy waking up is the same thing as
<br>
me waking up.  It seems more like something people on list really want to
<br>
believe then something that logically or scientifically makes sense..  The
<br>
key point is the copy is not the original me, so the copy waking up and
<br>
experiencing a continuity of conscioussness is different from the original
<br>
me waking up and experiencing a continuity of concioussness.  The difference
<br>
lies in an external vs internal verification.  From all other viewpoints,
<br>
this copy would indeed be me, as it would go on to do the thing I would have
<br>
done.  But internally, the subjective experience, it is not me, I died when
<br>
I crashed into the telephone pole or the meteorite fell on my head.  Copying
<br>
my neural pattern would have no external measurable effect, but it would
<br>
certainly have an internal one, as I would never wake up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In reality, unless the copy of me is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identical at the quantum level, theoretically a test could be made to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that this is not indeed the original me and is a copy.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;IMO this depends on how you define &quot;the original me&quot;.&quot;
<br>
<p>If the root of concioussness is the pattern of atoms in the brain, then
<br>
copying that pattern would copy the conciousness, as I mentioned in my
<br>
article.  (This is likely the most plausible scenerio)  If the root of
<br>
conscioussness lies within the quantum realm (as Roger Penrose argues) then
<br>
'me' is defined by this pattern and placement of these atoms that make up my
<br>
nuerons and these small quantum structures.  Given definition A, if an exact
<br>
copy can be made at the atomic level (via, say, passive scanning and
<br>
nanotechnology) then at the atomic level it is indistinguishable from the
<br>
original *except* fort he fact that the original me still exists.  Given the
<br>
observation that we can both exist at the same time, it is quite obvious
<br>
that there is no continuity of conscioussness for me.  You may be content in
<br>
a copy of you living on, but if you desire subjective immortality this is
<br>
not the way to attain it.
<br>
<p>&quot;Of course the statement above is true if you include your physical
<br>
properties in the
<br>
definition. But it is also true if I wake up in the hospital after an
<br>
amputation.&quot;
<br>
<p>But an amputation of a limb does not affect the physiological mechanisms
<br>
responsible for your concioussness.  That is, your brain and neo cortex and
<br>
the arrangement of atoms that represent you.  Likewise sleeping does not
<br>
affect this nueral pattern either, so making the analogy that sleeping and
<br>
waking up is similiar to a copy being made of you and the original destroyed
<br>
is illogical, as the copy is never made and the original never destroyed.
<br>
<p>&quot;Here the common sense view is that I am still me after the amputation. I
<br>
believe this common sense view still holds if part or
<br>
all of the physical brain is removed, provided the &quot;identity&quot; encoded in the
<br>
brain is preserved. And after a lot of thinking and reading on this issue, I
<br>
am more and more convinced that the simplest working definition of
<br>
&quot;identity&quot; is consciousness and memory. In other words a conscious being
<br>
with all my memories is me.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or, more specifically, a *copy* of you.  If we copied your nueral pattern
<br>
and created a duplicate of it, while still keeping you intact, and woke you
<br>
both up, what would happen?  If we took your copy into another room, would
<br>
you be experiencing subjectively what your copy was?  I doubt it.  Therefore
<br>
the copies 'waking up' and continuity of concsiousness is different and
<br>
isolated from yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no doubt in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my mind that this copy is a sentient being,  but there is a doubt in my
</em><br>
mind
<br>
<em>&gt;that it is *me*  Sure, my thoughts hopes dreams and fears and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contribution I may bring to the world may live on in this copy, but I do
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt;wake up and live on.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I think that if the copy feels continuity between the original you and
<br>
himself, then you wake up and live on. Unfortunately there appears to
<br>
be no way to establish an operative difference between this position
<br>
and yours. &quot;
<br>
<p>Sure there is, make a copy without destroying the original (an easy though
<br>
experiement) and place them in seperate rooms after waking them up, ask them
<br>
to describe what the other sees.  If you can describe what your copy sees,
<br>
then I would grant a continuity of conscioussness that is linked via the
<br>
pattern that was copied.  I doubt you would be able to describe what your
<br>
copy sees however, which establishes clearly that this is a seperate and
<br>
unique consciouss entity, and should we terminate you, then you die.  
<br>
<p>&quot;But to continue the argument, how can you be sure that you don't die every
<br>
night when you go to sleep and that the conscious being who awakes the next
<br>
morning is not a copy with the same memories?&quot;
<br>
<p>I cant say for sure, as I can not prove something that by definition can not
<br>
be tested.  How can you be sure there isnt an invisible dragon living in
<br>
your garage?  You cant prove negatives or things that by definition exist
<br>
outside the realm of testability.  But science offers an answer in the form
<br>
of Occam's razor.  When I go to sleep, by nueral pattern and atomic
<br>
arrangement is not destroyed, then copied and placed into a similiar body.
<br>
If my nueral pattern is not destroyed or affected, then it is reasonable to
<br>
assume that I am the same me that went to sleep the night before.  How do I
<br>
know I wasnt destroyed and recreated?  How do I know that the very passage
<br>
of time is not a continual process of destruction and copying of me?  You
<br>
cant, but there is no evidence to suggest either as the simplest
<br>
explanation.  At the plank length and time, as I mentioned in my post, space
<br>
time exists in no smaller intervals and transversing thus means that sub
<br>
atomic particles are continually quantum teleporting through these energy
<br>
barriers.  If part of concioussness is rooted in a quantum effect, this may
<br>
definately deserve some consideration.  Likely though it is rooted in the
<br>
patter of the microscopic atoms, and not the sub miscroscopic particles.
<br>
Changing the sub microscopic particulate makeup of an atom through quantum
<br>
passage through space-time has no bearing on the atom or its effect, let
<br>
alon the patterns of millions of atoms formed into a network of billions and
<br>
billions of nuerons.  
<br>
<p>If, every night, people could be observed to spontaneously dissapear then
<br>
reappaear a few moments later, such philosophical musing might require
<br>
consideration, but since people do not do such things, it is reasonable and
<br>
scientific to assume that the person who went to sleep is the same one who
<br>
woke up.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Well of course I also wish to continue living in my body, at least as long
<br>
as it provides me with a reasonable quality of life. But when this option is
<br>
not on the table anymore, and of course copy/upload technology has been
<br>
developen in the meantime, I believe I would be willing to try.&quot;
<br>
<p>An alternative to consider would be what I laid out in my original post.
<br>
That replacing only a few nuerons or atoms at a time in an overall nueral
<br>
pattern could not be said to effect continuity of conscioussness like
<br>
destroying and copying ALL of them simaltaneously would be.  Keep the number
<br>
of nuerons being replaced low, and the question becomes worthless.  The
<br>
human brain loses numerous nuerons every day and grows a few every year.  So
<br>
to me this would provide a good guideline to follow, and in the interim
<br>
(while waiting for these nuerons to be replaced) one should take diligent
<br>
care to protect the physiological housing of thier conscioussness.  
<br>
