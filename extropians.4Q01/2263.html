Robots Put Students First

<br>
Welcome to a robotics competition organized by First, a non-profit
<br>
organization that fosters interest in math, science and technology. The
<br>
group's name, &quot;For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology,&quot; is
<br>
a message taken seriously by the thousands of high school students whose lives
<br>
have been changed by these machines.
<br>
<p>Pasadena - Nov 5, 2001
<br>
As the buzzer sounds, the robots sprint toward the center of the arena. Using
<br>
metallic &quot;arms&quot; and other clever gadgets not seen on humans, the remotely
<br>
controlled machines manage to grab a giant beach ball and attempt to dunk it
<br>
into an oversized basket.
<br>
The crowd goes wild at every move as the machines try to score as many points
<br>
as they can, pulling no punches.
<br>
<p>Complete with referees, time clocks, loud music and cheerleaders, the game has
<br>
the flavor of a futuristic fight, the pulse of a rock and roll concert and the
<br>
excitement of an NBA playoff game. Everyone comes out a winner.
<br>
<p>Welcome to a robotics competition organized by First, a non-profit
<br>
organization that fosters interest in math, science and technology. The
<br>
group's name, &quot;For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology,&quot; is
<br>
a message taken seriously by the thousands of high school students whose lives
<br>
have been changed by these machines.
<br>
<p>With sponsorship provided by JPL and other NASA centers around the country,
<br>
students have six weeks to design and build a robot under the tutorship of
<br>
engineers and scientists. How well they do depends on the soundness of their
<br>
design.
<br>
<p>The next chance these teenagers will have to show off their robots is a
<br>
scrimmage set for Wednesday, Nov. 7, at JPL. The regional competition will
<br>
take place at the L.A. Memorial Sports Arena on April 4, 2002. Registration
<br>
for the regional competition is open through December 7.
<br>
<p>While the rules and specifications of the robots change every year, the
<br>
memories and lessons learned remain the same year after year. Just ask any of
<br>
the students involved in past competitions.
<br>
<p>Lauren Lyons, who was team captain while attending Archer School for Girls in
<br>
Los Angeles, credits the experience with changing her forever.
<br>
<p>&quot;The robotics competition has changed my life like nothing else in this world
<br>
has,&quot; said Lyons, who in 2000 and 2001 led her team all the way to the
<br>
national tournament in Florida. &quot;Two years ago I wanted to go into business, I
<br>
wanted to do simply what I knew would make me rich.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now a freshman at Princeton University, she is majoring in mechanical
<br>
engineering and plans to become an astronaut, a goal inspired by a field trip
<br>
to Kennedy Space Center following the national tournament in Orlando, Fla.
<br>
<p>&quot;Building a robot is so much fun, even if you don't want to become an engineer
<br>
you should try and join a team. You learn so much about life and working with
<br>
people,&quot; she said from her dorm at Princeton after a tough physics midterm.
<br>
&quot;Worst comes to worst, you'll end up with really marketable skills, like
<br>
you'll know how to hook up a pneumatic network or how a speed-controller
<br>
works.&quot;
<br>
<p>Participating in the program not only made her appreciate math and science,
<br>
but also made her actually enjoy them, she said in astonishment.
<br>
<p>&quot;Three engineers from JPL helped us and they were wonderful,&quot; she said. &quot;They
<br>
gave us the analytical tools and so much guidance, something physics books
<br>
couldn't give us.&quot;
<br>
<p>For her part, in the next few months Lyons will be volunteering her time and
<br>
expertise to the Trenton High School team in New Jersey.
<br>
<p>&quot;First provides kids with an intellectual sanctuary, a place where they can
<br>
work hard and play hard,&quot; Lyons said.
<br>
<p>Last year JPL sponsored 24 teams, providing mentor engineers to school and
<br>
volunteers to staff the regional competition. Altogether, last year NASA
<br>
sponsored more than 100 teams.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
