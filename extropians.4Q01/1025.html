<p>They sure did, didn't they? I liked their demonstration too. Too bad
<br>
the actual service has no resmblance to it.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, that's an excellent question, and I hope you forgive me for
<br>
posting my reply to the whole list. It needs to be said.
<br>
<p>Yes, apparently there is something you don't know about. They demand
<br>
personal information, including a billing address and credit card
<br>
number before they let you spend more than a certain cutoff amount
<br>
over the ENTIRE life of your account (i.e. not a $100 cap per
<br>
transaction, but for the whole thing). So basically anonymity is
<br>
shot. Furthermore, they have a history of freezing accounts for
<br>
nothing more than what they consider to be suspicious patterns of
<br>
activity (i.e. transfers in excess of a few grand). That makes them
<br>
essentially useless for any sort of high volume business.
<br>
<p>What do they get out of bending over for the man and being volunteer
<br>
police whores? Who knows. Maybe they just don't have any guts. Maybe
<br>
some sort of legal threat. Maybe simply an informer's fee. Don't know,
<br>
and if anybody does, please post! Liars need to be exposed.
<br>
<p>Bottom line, the idea of being secure against &quot;bad&quot; governments yet
<br>
still subpoenable by our own supposedly &quot;good&quot; government is
<br>
oxymoronic. If the cost of being based in the US is running your
<br>
business the way PayPal is, then move the hell offshore like E-Gold!
<br>
<p>For more PayPal info, here is the page (admittedly with an anti-PayPal
<br>
bias as strong as my own, but like my own, backed by actual
<br>
experiences with PayPal):
