<em>&gt; However, I think for most scientists, the practice of science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a quest, an investigation, an inquiry, an exploration.
</em><br>
<p>...would that it were so. Alas, Einstein more accurately summarized the truth
<br>
of the matter:
<br>
<p>&quot;Many kinds of men devote themselves to Science, and not all for the sake
<br>
of Science herself. There are some who come into her temple because it
<br>
offers them the opportunity to display their particular talents. To this
<br>
class of men science is a kind of sport in the practice of which they
<br>
exult, just as an athlete exults in the exercise of his muscular prowess.
<br>
There is another class of men who come into the temple to make an offering
<br>
of their brain pulp in the hope of securing a profitable return. These men
<br>
are scientists only by the chance of some circumstance which offered itself
<br>
when making a choice of career. If the attending circumstances had been
<br>
different they might have become politicians or captains of business.
<br>
Should an angel of God descend and drive from the Temple of Science all
<br>
those who belong to the categories I have mentioned, I fear the temple
<br>
would be nearly emptied. But a few worshipers would still remain -- some
<br>
from former times and some from ours. To these latter belongs our Planck.
<br>
And that is why we love him. I am quite aware that this clearance would
<br>
mean the driving away of many worthy people who have built up a great
<br>
portion, and even perhaps the greatest portion, of the Temple of Science.
<br>
But at the same time it is clear that if the men who have devoted
<br>
themselves to science consisted only of the two categories I have
<br>
mentioned, the edifice could never had grown to its present proud
<br>
dimensions, no more than a forest could grow if it consisted only of
<br>
creepers.&quot;
<br>
<p>The quote is from a prologue to a book by Max Planck, &quot;Where Is Science
<br>
Going&quot;, New York, 1932. (I am quoting from a secondary source, the preface
<br>
to the 7th edition of &quot;Manual of Psychiatry&quot; by Aaron J. Rosanoff, 1938.)
<br>
And who wrote that prologue? Albert Einstein. The situation is certainly
<br>
not better now than 69 years ago.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
