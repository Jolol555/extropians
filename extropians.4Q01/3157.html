<p>
The reason I choose to shut up about Afghanistan is that I don't
<br>
believe I am skillful enough to make much more difference on
<br>
this thread at this time.  A lot of people are hurting after
<br>
911.  A lot of people are having to confront a variety of things
<br>
that are painful and difficult to confront including where we
<br>
ourselves are not without wrongdoing and attitudes and policies
<br>
that feed such horrors.  A lot of us are having to confront our
<br>
xenophobia and relative ignorance of others and uncaring about
<br>
them as long as we are &quot;ok&quot;.  It is difficult to confront these
<br>
things.  It is difficult to reach past the wall within ourselves
<br>
and each other and acknowledge and begin to heal the pain, hurt
<br>
and so on inside of self and others.  
<br>
<p>I am not skillful enough to have not reached a point of
<br>
diminishing returns with what I have said.  I do not wish to be
<br>
part of hardening attitudes and positions further on this.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; stating fact. Blind denial of objective reality does not seem very
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-Western world DO hate us Westerners, our policy, and first of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our culture. Of course we do not share this point of view, but by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply reading popular press of, for example, Arab countries, one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced to at least ACKNOWLEDGE this fact. It is another fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current and past Western policies can motivate this hatred. Again, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am just trying to state opinioins from a point of view that I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real question should be: how do we take corrective actions against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these facts? Recent history shows that past corrective actions did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work. Perhaps we should try something else.
