<em>&gt;     &gt;You are confusing this statement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;The copies can always tell themselves apart.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;with this statement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;The copies can tell which was the original and which was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recreation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;The former statement is true and is what I claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think either statement is true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I make a identical copy of you and put both of you into identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are now running in parallel. When random quantum fluctuations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to diverge I interfere and nudge you back together. Which one are you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only proper answer is &quot;yes&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You have changed the question again, so now I perceive three different
<br>
questions with three different answers:
<br>
<p>1. Can copies can tell themselves apart?
<br>
Yes.  Each one consistently refers to themselves as &quot;me, here&quot; and the other
<br>
one as &quot;you, there&quot;.  They will never change or confuse their terminology.
<br>
Neither copy will ever mistakenly think that they are the other copy.
<br>
<p>2. Can copies can tell which was the original and which was the recreation?
<br>
This is a historical question.  If they kept track and have memory of the
<br>
copying event, they would remember which one was the original and which one
<br>
was the copy.  If nobody kept track, and the copies were unconscious during
<br>
the procedure or do not remember, then they would not know.  The fact that
<br>
no one can remember a historical event does not mean that it never happened.
<br>
There is a correct answer, but the copies may or may not know it.
<br>
<p>3. &quot;Which one are you?&quot;
<br>
This is a vague question with no definite answer.  The relative pronoun
<br>
&quot;you&quot; refers to different people at different times in different contexts.
<br>
I can only answer such a relative question using a relative answer.  &quot;I am
<br>
the copy standing right here.  I am not the other copy standing over there.&quot;
