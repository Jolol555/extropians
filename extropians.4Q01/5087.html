<p>
Getting along, as always needs to be noted, is a two-way street. It meets at 
<br>
the corner of mutuality and reciprocation. If the future is like Mr. Crocker 
<br>
has stated, the X-Men Effect ( a much watered-down version of the Marvel 
<br>
comic saga) will come into play. Can Jimmy-Bob be born again if he has 
<br>
committed the cardinal sin of cohabiting his God-given flesh with satanic, 
<br>
inhuman robot-stuff?
<br>
<p>My guess is Preacher, Bob Jones, will sayeth neigh! Brothers and Sisters. So 
<br>
Mr. Crocker's view's need to be heeded on this point. This has been discussed 
<br>
(a bit) in Hans Moravec's &quot;Robot.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Lee Daniel Crocker aptly, commented: 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Our present irrational concerns about race will be
<br>
wiped out not because we will come together, but because we will
<br>
diverge and speciate and migrate to the point where what are now
<br>
perceived as &quot;racial&quot; differences will be of less magnitude than
<br>
the individual differences we will be able to create.  As we grow
<br>
apart, it will be all the more important that we learn how to take
<br>
advantage of diversity and comparative advantage so that the new
<br>
races we become will continue to work effectively toward even
<br>
greater diversity and creativity as we expand into the universe.&gt;&gt;
