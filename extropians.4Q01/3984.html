<p><em>&gt; The energy that First World nations squander on air conditioning, for

</em><br>
<p>I wasn't even talking about this macroscopic level of energy efficiency.
<br>
What James and I were discussing was at the microscopic level.  I was
<br>
suggesting that &quot;if photosynthesis isn't efficient enough to power a
<br>
small device, then perhaps that small device needs to be engineered to
<br>
require less power while accomplishing the same task&quot; ... and James is
<br>
asserting that modern technology is already reaching (or has reached)
<br>
their limits.
<br>
<p>To James, I say:  Some laws were meant to be broken.  I firmly believe
<br>
that the laws of thermodynamics are not true laws of nature, but just
<br>
a stop-gap milestone in our understanding of the physical world with
<br>
which we interact.  We will discover that even the laws of
<br>
thermodynamics don't hold as laws at a certain level, and we'll make
<br>
a great breakthrough that will totally change the way we manipulate
<br>
our physical surroundings.
<br>
<p>My only curiousity is if this breakthrough will occur in my lifetime.
<br>
If the sentiment that you hold, that the laws of thermodynamics are
<br>
indeed strong laws and are a limiting factor, is widespread amongst
<br>
the scientific community, then sadly I say I doubt it WILL happen
<br>
within my lifetime.
