</em><br>
<p>A very good question. My personal strategy is to have as many new
<br>
sources as possible with as different biases as possible, comparing them
<br>
with each other. Sure, both CNN and Al Jazira are biased, but not in the
<br>
same way - and the bias of Slashdot is very different from the bias of
<br>
Dagens Nyheter. 
<br>
<p>Let's see if we can do some information theory here. Assume we have an
<br>
information source S (the Truth), which we get information about through
<br>
noisy and biased channels. In some cases we know the bias, in some cases
<br>
it is unknown. What is the optimal estimate of S?
<br>
<p>To make things more concrete, assume S is a scalar we want to estimate
<br>
(like the probability of Bin Laden being a nice guy or the number of
<br>
dead in a bombing). From information channel i we receive an estimate
<br>
s_i, which is s_i = a_i S +  N(b_i,c_i): - a_i is how much S is
<br>
distorted, b_i is the bias and c_i the standard deviation. The
<br>
distribution of s_i becomes f(s_i | S) = N(x-a_iS-b_i,c_i). Here I
<br>
assume independent channels (BIG assumption!). 
<br>
<p>Given data from s_i, we can then do a maximum likelyhood estimation of
<br>
a_i, b_i and c_i if we hold S constant (i.e compare the news about a
<br>
certain fact for a while). 
<br>
<p>Bayes rule says that the distribution of S given s_i is f(S | s_1, s_2,
<br>
...) = [integral f(S,s) ds] f(s | S) / integral [integral f(S,s) ds] f(s
<br>
| S) dS where f(S,s) is the joint distribution of S and s_1, s_2,.... We
<br>
already have f(s_i|S), so f(s|S)= product f(s_i|S).  So we get f(S| s) =
<br>
f(S) product f(s_i|S) / &lt;normalizing stuff&gt;.
<br>
<p>We still have the Bayes factor f(S) - we need an estimate of that. This
<br>
is where our own preconceptions and world assumptions come in. Usually I
<br>
think we simply assume it is normally distributed and rescaled to have
<br>
zero mean and 1 variance. 
<br>
<p>OK, this seems to suggest a method: gather s_i, for each channel create
<br>
a maximum likeliehood estimate of a_i, b_i and c_i given the assumption
<br>
S=N(0,1), put it into the formula above and we get a
<br>
posterior distribution of S. 
<br>
<p>If channels are of uncertain independence, we can either calculate
<br>
correlations between them for a while, and then select a set that are
<br>
uncorrelated. A more clever method would be to use principal component
<br>
analysis to create &quot;virtual channels&quot; that are weighted sums of the
<br>
channels that are mutually independent and hence could be used to
<br>
estimate S.
<br>
<p>Caveat: I'm not a staticistician and this was just off the cuff - there
<br>
has to be some serious analysis on this, I just don't know where to
<br>
look (and I don't have the time). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I only have a crude approximation of such a strategy, where I assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher credibility to an institution if liberals accuse it of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative and conservatives accuse it of being liberal. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many domains this heuristic doesn't cover though, so I'm looking for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.
</em><br>
<p>A nice strategy, I like it!
<br>
<p>This is a bit like finding a channel that is independent of two known
<br>
anticorrelated channels.
