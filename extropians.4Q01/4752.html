<p>War between &quot;professional&quot; soldiers has some degree of legitimacy to it.
<br>
In some respects it is like &quot;dueling&quot; of the 16th and 17th centuries.
<br>
An extropic perspective I would think argues that disputes should be
<br>
settled through reason.  I don't know what it would say when they
<br>
absolutely cannot be settled that way.  I.e. one understands the
<br>
other person's perspective, agrees that the position is completely
<br>
logical but refuses to give ground on your perspective because it
<br>
is based on ones own unique experiences (as their position is based
<br>
on theirs).
<br>
<p>In such situations, settling the dispute by a method agreed upon by
<br>
both parties (if one cannot agree to disagree) seems the best solution.
<br>
<p>However the settlement process should avoid to the greatest degree
<br>
possible the involvement of third parties.  That is why chemical
<br>
and biological weapons and mines (and bombs that miss their targets)
<br>
are much less desirable than pistols at 20 paces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; War is a filthy business. Let's eliminate it altogether. Suggestions are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welcome.
</em><br>
<p>Increase the security and survivability of others such that &quot;war&quot;
<br>
is not a choice where the potential benefits are perceived to a
<br>
large extent to justify the risks involved.
<br>
<p>Also decrease large hierarchical political structures where too
<br>
much distance between the people at the top and people at the
<br>
bottom make it easy to send people you don't know off to war
<br>
(the Soviet troops in Afghanistan come to mind).
