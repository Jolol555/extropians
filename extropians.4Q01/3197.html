<p>Since WW1, the definition of democracy has shifted so as to exclude enemy

states.  Thus, a nation like Yugoslavia was not a democracy for the Clinton

<br>
<p>My point in dragging this out is to show that there's been a lot of debate
<br>
on the issue by the experts in the field of international relations.  I tend
<br>
to think that democracy guarantees nothing in respect to war -- except that
<br>
wars will more likely be total and less farsighted.  This claim seems backed
<br>
by historical evidence.  The 20th century, e.g., in terms of warfare, saw
<br>
total war become nearly perfected.  Also, wars from previous centuries --
<br>
the American War between the States, for example -- that are total tend to
<br>
have a democratic state involved.  In the example just used, the Union did
<br>
presage 20th century war in mobilizing the whole of society for war.  (I do
<br>
not believe the Confedrates were considered a _nondemocracy_ at the time.
<br>
If they were and anyone maintains the Union was a democracy at the same
<br>
time, then the Union must have only become a democracy during the war, since
<br>
the Confederacy was part of it prior to 1861...)
<br>
<p>As for the lack of foresight, I mean the trend to look not toward a lasting
<br>
peace after the war, but merely to fighting ferociously during the war,
<br>
often obliterating the other society to the point that it creates a power
<br>
vacuum.  This did happen in both World Wars.  (For the record, I don't think
<br>
that foresight involves creating an international welfare state for after
<br>
the war.  Wars, instead, could be fought in a limited fashion with the
<br>
limited aims, the goal being to make the peace after a war better than that
<br>
before.  Destroying Germany in WW2 did not do this.  It lead to 40 years of
<br>
costly and nearly fatal conflict with the USSR.  BUT I've been over this
<br>
before on this list!:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
