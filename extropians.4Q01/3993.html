On Mon, 10 Dec 2001, Dossy asked me...
<br>
<p>[BTW, there is no offense taken to the questions.  I'm
<br>
not easily offended and don't mind providing personal
<br>
information if it helps contribute to your picture of
<br>
my experiences and therefore my POV.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Sorry to produce yet another reply to this so late in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread ...)
</em><br>
<p>Don't worry, some of the conversations go on for weeks...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert, do you know who your biological father (or biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents) are?
</em><br>
<p>To the best of my knowledge yes.  But I've never actually been
<br>
tested to determine whether I got switched at the hospital.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How certain are you that they are indeed your true biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents, particularly your father?
</em><br>
<p>Moderately certain, but not absolutely.  For my purposes I
<br>
don't particularly need 100% certainty.  They were both around
<br>
when I was growing up, did a relatively good job with myself
<br>
and my brothers and so I'm pretty content with the status quo.
<br>
I actually enjoy being part of the Bradbury &quot;clan&quot;, so I'm
<br>
not interested in rocking the boat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did you observe infidelity between your parents as you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing up?  Was the question of you being your father's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological child ever brought up while you were growing up?
</em><br>
<p>No and no.  Though my brothers do often claim I'm the mailman's
<br>
child much to the annoyance of my mother.
<br>
<p>Damien commented:
<br>
<em>&gt; Oh dear. That might work for you, my good Mr Spock (but wait! that can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right--Robert is a wildly emotional seeming dude, and the better for it),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it has no bearing on how the genes+culture bias toward feeling jealous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *actually works*.  [snip]
</em><br>
<p>I understand how it is &quot;supposed&quot; to work and how many people may experience
<br>
it.  Whether it is genes or experiences I am unsure, but at least with that
<br>
particular emotion I believe I've diminished its steely grip on my mind.
<br>
<p>The reasoning process is something like this.  My first priority is
<br>
to be the director of &quot;my own person&quot;.  My second is to try and be
<br>
fair or balanced.  Others imposing fidelity rules upon me would
<br>
violate the first priority.  To fullfill the second priority I
<br>
must be reciprocal.  The paternity testing idea is a rational
<br>
corral around what is prumably a genetic drive that males should
<br>
have not to devote resources to offspring they are unrelated to.
<br>
Some of the other issues raised, like &quot;time faithfullness&quot;, also
<br>
fall under the first/second priority rules.
<br>
<p>That doesn't mean that one cannot develop a monogamous relationship
<br>
(a tip of the hat to Spike) through voluntary sign-up but there would
<br>
have to be opt-out clauses (for me).  The structure of most common contracts
<br>
(and therefore most meme sets other humans possess), e.g. marriage,
<br>
tends to be all or nothing.  I've yet to find someone with whom one
<br>
can define how this aspect of a relationship should be structured
<br>
based on reason rather than emotion.  My last experience of having
<br>
my mind hijacked by an emotion (love, rather than jealousy) left a
<br>
sufficiently deep scar that I currently prefer to generalize the
<br>
expression of that emotion to a larger class of individuals (humanity)
<br>
rather than wrestle with single significant points of failure.
<br>
<p>John commented:
<br>
<em>&gt; One plus where religion(especially conservative) is concerned is as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added buttress against infidelity.  This would be a big attraction for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both men and women.  Especially in our day and age, with so many coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from divorced families who want to do better with their own marriages.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;Human Sexuality&quot; psych course I took circa '89 at the U.W.
<br>
had an interesting discussion of a tribe in India where the village
<br>
elders take the adolescents of the tribe, collect them into a &quot;camp&quot;
<br>
for a few months and have them all sleep with all of the other potential
<br>
mates in the village.  At the same time they are actually trained to
<br>
become good sex partners.  Interestingly enough the village has a
<br>
phenomenally low divorce rate (&lt; 5%(?)).  I suspect it is because one
<br>
learns who the right partner may be for you and the idea that &quot;the grass
<br>
may be greener elsewhere&quot; may be, to a large degree, purged from
<br>
the meme set of individuals having this experience.
<br>
<p>Food for thought.
<br>
Robert
