</em><br>
<p>True.  Current launch costs are about $10000/lb, or about $5000/kg.
<br>
However, most launch technology development is going towards reusable
<br>
launch vehicles (one or maybe two stages), with costs estimated to be
<br>
$100/lb - $50/kg - or less, *and* they can take unhardened cargoes
<br>
like humans as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Two immediate obsevations.  Weightlessness would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow an EXTREMELY large dish, and the hard vacuum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of space seems to suggest that the reflective surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be subject to oxidative degradation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to size, anyone care to suggest how big is too big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and why?
</em><br>
<p>Micrometeorite and other space junk impacts.  Unless you can come up
<br>
with a way for the dish to be cheaply patched.  Perhaps a bunch of
<br>
sensors to detect this damage, and a leaf-like structure of veins and
<br>
capillaries to pump liquid stock dish material to any wounded sites
<br>
and patch minor holes within a day or so of their being made?
<br>
<p>Actually, on that thought...I wonder if efficient conversion from
<br>
ATP to electricity would be possible, and if so, would it make sense
<br>
to just put living leaves out (either large bunches of leaves or, more
<br>
likely, large single leaves) and pump nutrients (including carbon
<br>
dioxide) to them, letting them gather the sunlight to power the space
<br>
station?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I envision the dish as spin stabilized to keep it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointed at the sun, with steam generator, and dual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter-rotating turbine/generator units axially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mounted, and the waste heat radiator located in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shadow behind the dish.
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't direct photovoltaic be more efficient than a steam
<br>
generator?
