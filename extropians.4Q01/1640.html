<p><em>&gt;Difficult doesn't begin to describe it. It will take cops to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Those with pirated files on their computers? Those who have a copy

<em>&gt;develop BearShare and LimeWire? Those who develop the theoretical

</em><br>
<em>&gt;transgressors?  Carnivore? ISPs, schools, and employers forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be de-facto deputies? Sounds like a lot of cops and deputies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me. How are our first and fourth ammendment rights going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;safeguarded in the process?  Who is going to pay for these cops
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and deputies? Will they be funded by a special, RIAA-members-only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tax or will the cost of protecting recording industry business
</em><br>
<em>&gt;models be distributed to all taxpayers? How will we taxpayers be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compensated for their money and their curtailed civil liberties?
</em><br>
<p>So what if it's hard?
<br>
<p>First I'd do probably exactly what the copyright holders are doing,
<br>
go after the napsters of the world. Then I'd probably go after
<br>
people who manufacture equipment that assists in this theft.
<br>
<p>If I had the political clout, I'd go after the backbone itself,
<br>
filter from the NAPs and you could stop all of this traffic in the
<br>
U.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even if these extreme measures were taken, those whose income
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depends on information being an excludable good would still go out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of business.  As Mr. Bradbury (I think it was) pointed out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consumers will just opt for free alternatives. Not only because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are free-as-in-beer, but also because their use presents the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fewest legal complications and the least CPU/disk-space/code
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasted (from the consumer's point of view) on copy protection and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;digital rights management.
</em><br>
<p>People aren't opting for the free alternatives, they want these
<br>
items, they just don't want to have to pay for them.
<br>
<p>In the digital age theft has become so easy and the chance of
<br>
punishment so small, that millions pretend they're not stealing at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The software industry already knows this, and are busily trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create technical (.NET) and legal barriers to entry. Book and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;music publishers will follow suit.
</em><br>
<p><p>They are trying to protect their material and it's associated
<br>
revenue stream.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Call it downloading, call it theft, call it etaoin shrdlu. The age
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of whatever you choose to call it is upon us. Perhaps I misnamed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this thread. I should have posed it as a question:
</em><br>
<p>It's like the old story about &quot;if you call a dogs tail a leg how
<br>
many legs does a dog have?&quot; The answer is still four because
<br>
calling the tail a leg doesn't make it one. Calling theft of
<br>
copyrighted material &quot;downloading&quot; doesn't make it a leg either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I await your answer.
</em><br>
<p>You got it.
