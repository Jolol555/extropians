Brian,
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if you'll get this as I believe I'm being filtered.  But it 
<br>
needs saying, and I consider it appropriate to say it here.
<br>
<p>If through my comments or responses to your statements in this forum, I 
<br>
exacerbated your anger, I am sorry.  If I made your grief more difficult to 
<br>
bear.  If I made these times even a little harder for you, I regret it and 
<br>
apologize unreservedly to you or it.  It was my error not to pick up on 
<br>
your feelings (clear to me now in hindsight) in your postings, and for that 
<br>
I am truly sorry.
<br>
<p>Have a peaceful day,
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
<br>
