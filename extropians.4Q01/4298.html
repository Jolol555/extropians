</em><br>
<p>You are right, as far as you go.  But I think the phrase &quot;doesn't matter&quot; is
<br>
incomplete.  It doesn't matter &quot;for some purposes&quot;.  It doesn't matter to
<br>
&quot;external people.&quot;  We can't really debate if something is &quot;good enough&quot;
<br>
without defining good enough &quot;for a particular purpose.&quot;  If you want to
<br>
replace me with someone else who will post to this list like I do, the copy
<br>
is good enough and it doesn't matter.  If you want to meet my goal of making
<br>
my current self live forever, making a copy does not add any longevity to me
<br>
or the copy.  If my current self gets killed, having a copy doesn't prevent
<br>
its death.  For my purposes of extending my current lifespan and preventing
<br>
the ending of my current lifespan, it does matter and the copy is not good
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's because your twin knows subjectively he is not you, something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't happen with a copy.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  The way I know that I am not my twin is that I am inside a body I
<br>
call &quot;me&quot; here.  My brother is in a similar body over there.  I can never
<br>
confuse the person &quot;here&quot; with the person &quot;there&quot;.  Even if other people
<br>
can't tell us apart, I never get confused as to which body I am in.  I have
<br>
always been in the copy I call “me”, and never have considered that other
<br>
copy to be “me”.  Having more similarities with my twin won’t change my
<br>
mind.
<br>
<p>I think we have a relativity problem.  The word “me” applies to anybody we
<br>
want.  You are using the one pronoun “me” to point at two people at the same
<br>
time.  It is no wonder it is confusing.  Not only are they exactly alike,
<br>
but you call them by the same name.  This problem only occurs to outside
<br>
viewers.
<br>
<p>Internally, each copy can easily distinguish itself from the other.  The
<br>
self is always “here”.  The other is always “there”.  Each copy that wakes
<br>
up experiences an attachment to only one copy that it considers itself.  The
<br>
other copy, no matter how exact, is always seen as being some “other” over
<br>
there.  The copies themselves will never get the two confused.
<br>
<p>They are exactly alike in all ways to all external viewpoints.  But their
<br>
internal viewpoints are separate.  Their self-identify mechanisms point to
<br>
two separate bodies.  They do not self-identify the same person as “me”.
<br>
They each have chosen a separate nomenclature.  They do not agree on which
<br>
is “me” and which is “you”.  Just like a person looking in a mirror, they
<br>
are duplicates but reversed.  What one considers “right” the other considers
<br>
“left”.  What one considers “inside the mirror” the other considers “outside
<br>
the mirror”.  Like a reverse writing in a mirror that is atom-by-atom
<br>
exactly like the original, one can be read easily by a copy while the other
<br>
seems alien and backwards.
<br>
<p>I propose that for my purposes only, the concept of “me” is defined not just
<br>
by any body, but the local body being inhabited.  “My” body responds to my
<br>
commands while “other” bodies don’t.  “My” body supplies me with sensory
<br>
input while “other” bodies don’t.  “My” memories are directly accessible to
<br>
me, while “other” memories aren’t.  “My” self is always here, while “other”
<br>
selves are always there.  I am in direct thought-controlled communication
<br>
with “me”.  It is this access or functionality that defines “me”.  Not my
<br>
memories, not my looks, not my personality.  All these will change, but my
<br>
relative perception of me-here-now will never change.  That is my automatic
<br>
self-detection criteria.  Even if I wake up in an alien body, with no
<br>
memories, and a completely different personality, I will think I am “me” and
<br>
wonder where I am.
