What I hear you saying is that the civilians (children, women, and men)
<br>
killed &quot;collateral damage&quot; have no one to blame but themselves and should
<br>
just die in silence _AND_ that as a citizen of the U.S. their deaths are
<br>
also my fault since I ostensibly have the power to prevent them since I
<br>
supposedly control the actions of my government's current (and past) foreign
<br>
state modification projects.
<br>
<p>I'm not buying your argument and the 40 civilians killed on Saturday and the
<br>
103 killed on Sunday aren't either.
<br>
<p>For some reason I was under the impression that Extropianism was a form of
<br>
transhumanism that had a very positive philosophy on the dignity of
<br>
individuals as apposed to a state Social Darwinism agenda.

&gt; &gt; The USA is dropping bombs on these people for god's sake!
&gt;
&gt; The USA is dropping bombs on a country that has provided a regime
&gt; that has been tolerant to a large terrorist organization for almost
&gt; a decade.
&gt;
&gt; There are 20+ million people in Afghanistan.  There were a few
&gt; tens of thousands in the Taliban and the military.  If you
&gt; believe that a population cannot control the destiny of a
&gt; country then *PLEASE* explain the situation in Argentina
&gt; over the last several weeks.  The Taliban arose in Afghanistan
&gt; because the population accepted it.
&gt;
&gt; The USA has made significant efforts to only target members
&gt; of Al Qa'ida and Taliban and I believe in most cases has
&gt; been successful in that effort.  I believe that most people
&gt; would agree that although there have been some errors the
&gt; civilian casualties have been minimal.
&gt;
&gt; Civilian populations are ultimately responsible for the
&gt; actions of their governments.  In the U.S. that lead
&gt; to civilians in the WTC being targets for terrorists.
&gt; In Afghanistan that results in civilians being brought
&gt; into the &quot;line of fire&quot; in eliminating the Taliban and
&gt; Al Qa'ida.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The USA is at least partly responsible for the rise of the Taliban to
power.
&gt; &gt; The USA helped create, train &amp; directly funded, elements in Afghanistan
&gt; &gt; that are at least partly responsible for the terrible years of war
&gt; &gt; &amp; bloodshed that the country has endured.
&gt;
&gt; I do not see an assertion here that the U.S. is responsible for the
&gt; decade of war the Afghani's were subjected to by the Soviet Union.
&gt; The Taliban rose to power in the vacuum that arose only after the
&gt; S.U. was defeated.  Yes, the U.S. helped empower many of the
&gt; people responsible for dragging Afghanistan into an anarchy
&gt; but that was in response to acts of conquest by others.
&gt; I see no claims that life as a Soviet colonial state shoulda/
&gt; woulda/coulda been better than that under Taliban rule.
&gt;
&gt; (I will not disagree in hindsight that the S.U. may have been
&gt; more extropic than the Taliban -- but one has to argue that
&gt; that the consequences of various actions could have been known
&gt; in advance.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; How many Afghanis have died as a direct result of American policies?
&gt;
&gt; How many Afghanis died as a direct result of Soviet policies?
&gt; How many Afghanis died as the result of economic havoc created
&gt; by the Soviets or the Taliban?  How many Afghanis died because
&gt; citizens were simply too weak to stand up against the Soviets
&gt; or the Taliban?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; they helped psychotic religious nuts become our government by giving
&gt; &gt; them guns &amp; missiles,
&gt;
&gt; Facts not in evidence.  While the Intelligence Service of Pakistan
&gt; may have helped promote the Taliban I doubt a case can be made that
&gt; the U.S. gave them &quot;guns &amp; missiles&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; *What* possible agenda could the U.S. have where it would promote
&gt; the success of fundamentalist Islamic memes ?!?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you really expect twenty odd years of utter bastardry to be just
&gt; &gt; forgotten, just because NOW you've decided to act with SOME decency?
&gt;
&gt; No.  But some people may remember that the U.S. *did* help liberate
&gt; Afghanistan from the Soviets.  Others may remember that the U.S. *did*
&gt; help liberate them from the Taliban (as people celbrating in the streets
&gt; seems to demonstrate).
&gt;
&gt; But people have short memories and they will ultimately be determined
&gt; by who puts food on their table tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you truly want the US to be safe then the US must act responsibly.
&gt; &gt; It must stop its political &amp; military support of terrorists (sorry,
&gt; &gt; they're &quot;freedom fighters&quot; - at least they are until they start bombing
YOU)
&gt;
&gt; I believe the estimates of the number of people who may have been
&gt; murdered by Stalin ranges from 7-30 million people.  Unless you can
&gt; make a case that &quot;responsible action&quot; would have been ignoring the
&gt; threat of communist dictatorships then I would say your suggestion
&gt; that the U.S. did not act responsibly is &quot;salt spray&quot; being cast
&gt; by the wind up from an ocean (an interesting odor but little
&gt; substance).
&gt;
&gt; I'm going to state it quite clearly to Neil, Amara, Samantha
&gt; and others who may be placing a high value on &quot;current&quot; human
&gt; lives (vs. past or future human lives) -- Hitler and Stalin
&gt; *MURDERED* millions of people.  Unless you can make *clear*
&gt; and *reasoned* cases for when one should or should not oppose
&gt; political power structures that give rise to Hitlers &amp; Stalins
&gt; I think your positions are on swampy ground.  How many times
&gt; should one watch Hitlers &amp; Stalins repeat themselves before
&gt; one acts?
&gt;
&gt; Here is my challenge to you -- define precisely how many people
&gt; should be killed and what evidence of their deaths should be required
&gt; before one should set into motion political (&amp; military) opposition
&gt; against the likes of Hitler, Stalin or bin Laden?
&gt;
&gt; (For example, I believe Amnesty International has well documented
&gt; hundreds or thousands of cases where people are being killed annually
&gt; by various governments, yet I hear not a *word* of equivalent
&gt; rhetoric against the governments of Russia, China, Burma, Rwanda,
&gt; Indonesia, etc.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; America must become responsible &amp; decent. The empty rhetoric of &quot;liberty
&amp;
&gt; &gt; justice for all&quot;, the lie of &quot;the protector of freedom&quot; &amp; the &quot;champion
of
&gt; &gt; justice&quot; must become true.
&gt;
&gt; The only way to impose &quot;freedom&quot; &amp; &quot;justice&quot; on most nations that
&gt; currently exist in the world would be to conquer them and then redefine
&gt; their political system as the U.S. did with Japan.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; America can lead the world, and not just militarily or commercially but
&gt; &gt; ethically as well, if only the government &amp; the people of America have
&gt; &gt; the strength and courage.
&gt;
&gt; I would suggest that you have not been reading the discussions of the last
&gt; several months on the extropians list, nor the popular news such as the
&gt; NY Times.  The &quot;ethics&quot; of people with &quot;fundamentalist&quot; perspectives are
&gt; drastically different from those of the America.  Grossly simplified they
&gt; are &quot;If you believe what we believe, then we will tolerate you --
otherwise
&gt; we want to destroy you&quot; in contrast to something along the lines of &quot;We
will
&gt; try to understand you and accept you, even if your beliefs are quite
different
&gt; from our own&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There can be no justification for the events of 9/11 just as there can
be no
&gt; &gt; justification for the many atrocities &amp; crimes of convenience that have
been
&gt; &gt; committed in America's name.
&gt;
&gt; Claims without facts.  I believe the body count of &quot;innocent&quot; people
&gt; in Afghanistan is still significantly below that of &quot;innocent&quot; people
&gt; in the 911 attacks.  When that ceases to be true I will begin to
&gt; consider whether the U.S. is committing &quot;atrocities &amp; crimes&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The cycle of hatred has to stop somewhere or we
&gt; &gt; will see the events of 9/11 happening again. And again. And again.
&gt;
&gt; It isn't a cycle of &quot;hatred&quot; -- it might be a cycle of &quot;fear&quot;.
&gt; America may have a fear of individuals with &quot;absolute&quot; power
&gt; in any nation because the can command forces that represent
&gt; threats to both U.S. government officials as well as significant
&gt; numbers of U.S. citizens.  If one accepts that the primary purpose
&gt; of a U.S. government is to protect its citizens -- not to impose
&gt; its own &quot;framework&quot; on the world -- then its actions have been
&gt; quite &quot;restricted&quot; over the years.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; America can be more than just America the great, it could truly become
&gt; &gt; America the good, America the just, America the free, if only the nation
&amp;
&gt; &gt; it's people have the courage &amp; the humility to change for the better, to
&gt; &gt; give as well as receive, to heal instead of harm, to become a true
leader of
&gt; &gt; humanity.
&gt;
&gt; Noble.  And I agree in principle.  But this is the &quot;carrot&quot; argument
&gt; and I question whether it works with some individuals (or countries)
&gt; without the &quot;stick&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; can America the same selfless courage as a nation?
&gt;
&gt; It has demonstrated such in the past and I do not doubt that
&gt; the resolve is present to do so again.  A significant question
&gt; is whether or not we have leaders capable of doing so.
