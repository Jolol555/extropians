I waited a little late to post this, so now we are under a bit of time
<br>
pressure.  I found Gina Miller a Tigger card that should brighten
<br>
her day, Tigger being the unofficial extropian mascot.   That day
<br>
would be brighter still, should she receive another care package from
<br>
the extropians, filled with those dynamically optimistic Tiggery memes
<br>
(such as the unofficial extropian motto:  woo hoooo woo hooo!)
<br>
Recall we sent a package about a month ago, and she was
<br>
delighted to get the notes, being as she faces trying circs.
<br>
<p>So get with it, Nanogirl fans.  Peck up a Ginagram, post it to me,
<br>
Ill print them out, add the Tigger card and snail mail them on
<br>
up.  Weve already missed getting it there in time for the solstice
<br>
but if we act quicksmart, it should get there in time for newtonmas.
<br>
If you want to include your snail mail @, thats fine too, as I was
<br>
planning to include some postage stamps.
<br>
<p>If no one abjects, I figure I will print out a few selected
<br>
extro posts, so she can see things havent changed much.
<br>
<p>Kidding!  bygones.  {8^D
<br>
<p>For those who wrote last month, thanks!  I heard from Gina's
<br>
husband Jim Lewis, who said she was delighted at our remembering
<br>
our comrade-in-memes.  If you don't know who Gina Miller is, do
<br>
review her URLs, and if you dont know why we are sending her
<br>
snail mail, then write one anyway, and send it on.  Thanks!  spike
<br>
<p>ps Gina gets out in February!
