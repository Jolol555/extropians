<i>&gt; &gt; restaurants who use it.  And though in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I am evidently in a tiny minority, most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; restaurants will leave out the cilantro if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I ask them to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The majority is in control of what food is supplied, even if you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; buy and eat it.</i><br>
<p>
No, because we can say that the customers and the business constructed the  <br>
market -- but nobody of them can control the market. The market rules are<br>
result of all autonomous decisions of individuals inside this market. This  <br>
is a kind of social anarchy like the social order among accidental humans  <br>
on the street controlled only by prohability calculus.<br>
<p>
You cannot "vote" with your money. You can only make a decision what you  <br>
buy and what you don't buy. The prohability calculus proved that there are  <br>
a prohability that other customers make a decision in your way -- but you  <br>
cannot know or prove this if you are really part of a mayority. Every mar-  <br>
ket investigation based on 10 000 or 2 000 humans in each survey and the  <br>
speculation that this humans represent market trends. But anybody can know  <br>
if this is really true.<br>
<p>
If you discuss about this you have to be avare about the paradoxy of every  <br>
election or market survey.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; But what about your firms interaction</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; with individuals (i.e. customers)?  Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; you consider that a centralist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Where's the center?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The firm would be the centre, even if it is 'controlled' by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; customers.  (As I've said before, even the most totalitarian of</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments are 'controlled' by their people.)</i><br>
<p>
Theoretically, yes. But the customers didn't control the firms direct and  <br>
cannot make a real decision to sabotage this firm and strengthen an other  <br>
(what voters can!) because they don't know each others and havn't no means  <br>
to get a avareness about there mayority. And on the other hand can every  <br>
firm only make offers but cannot be in the real rule of a center. This is  <br>
the story of success of MLM because here the firm is a real center and can  <br>
act as a center because this firm know his customers and can guide and  <br>
control parts of their custom behaviour to sell the produkts.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Your customers control (vote by money)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the company which takes precedence over</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the decisions of individual customers or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; smaller groups of customers. It's a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; incomplete precedence. Individual customers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't set their own prices, decide on which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; products you make, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, not in my present firm, no; I assume all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clients are offered essentially the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contract.  But my previous employer sets</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; different terms for each client (often giving</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them a choice), because their circumstances</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; vary and they want different services. In each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; case, clients are free to shop around for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; better deal, whether for a lower price or for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; services more fitting to their needs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps because of a firm's size they can offer a more individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; deal.  But I'm sure a smaller government doesn't have to generalise</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite so much as a larger government, yet they are both centralist</i><br>
<i>&gt; entities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Where's the center?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, the firm is the centre.  Just because it has not been quite so</i><br>
<i>&gt; successful at forcing me to use its product (like a government) it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not decentralised.  And just because there are more firms than</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments, they are not decentralised.  And just because firms are</i><br>
<i>&gt; smaller than governments, they are not decentralised.</i><br>
<p>
Smaller than governments, ey? For example, the danish government rule  <br>
about 5,8 Million inhabitants. The firm AOL/Compuserve "rule" about 15  <br>
Million customers/net-user in the hole world. Who is larger?<br>
<p>
No, Wax, the only diffrent is: Firms wants to "rule" just about parts of  <br>
the behaviour of customers -- but governments wants to rule about the hole  <br>
behaviour of all inhabitants.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
