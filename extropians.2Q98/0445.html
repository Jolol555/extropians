<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: Silly argument. The relation is meaningful</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By "meaningful" do you mean "nontrivial"?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: That's tangential to the issue. The<br>
  issue is "is identity a product of 'same <br>
  as' or 'different than,'" and whichever <br>
  it is, is the principle of identity.<br>
<p>
  Your doing a lot of talking but no <br>
  evidencing of your case by showing <br>
  an identity that is what it is free<br>
  from difference, free from relation.<br>
<p>
  Difference is the definition of <br>
  identity, both logically and factually.<br>
<p>
  A is A if and only if A is different than not-A.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; You just tried to find an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; example of meaningful self-relation and did</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; so only by including exactly that which you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; purported need not be a part of relation!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Please pay attention: I explicitly called your attention (once again) to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the distinction between vernacular identity and mathematical identity.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: You mean "vernacular ID" and "logical ID"<br>
  have different identities because their different?<br>
  Gee. OK, so why don't you define that difference?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, you're failing to distinguish between two things and two</i><br>
<i>&gt;perceptions of the same thing. When I say "I believe this cat is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same as yesterday's cat" what I really mean is "I believe that my</i><br>
<i>&gt;present perception and yesterday's perception are of one and the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;cat" -- not at all that "the two cats are equal".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: "Equal" = "same as." I think <br>
  your talking in a circle going nowhere.<br>
<p>
  The cat is defined by difference, and <br>
  you have still not shown us otherwise.<br>
  You mission is clear and simple, no <br>
  need for lots of talk... so where's <br>
  the goods? Where's this difference <br>
  free non-holistic identity??? You've<br>
  now had a year or two to find it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also, the cat is always relatied to not-cat.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Everything is related to everything in *some* way. My quarrel is with</i><br>
<i>&gt;your contention that everything is related to everything (except</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibly itself) in the *same* way.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Well, your trying to argue that some <br>
   things are what they are as a result of be-<br>
   ing related to nothing else. You've still <br>
   not shown an example of that. Once you <br>
   have, or concede you cannot, then we <br>
   can nit-pick about degrees of relation.<br>
   First things first, show me the goods.<br>
   Show me the non-different identity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: Fluffy is being related to the black void!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Fluffy is DIFFERENT than the black void. How more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; obvious could it be? How more transparent can the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; infection by the "same as" crackpot meme be? It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; causing you to make the most absurd arguments,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; arguments that defeat themselves by 100%!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yawn. Okay, what if there's only the black void? Can I say that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;black void which I perceive right now is the same black void as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;black void which I perceive right now?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: In so saying you've just passed<br>
   in time from "black void at moment 1"<br>
   to "bv at m2." But I'm not saying <br>
   that "same as" is nonexistent, just<br>
   that it's not the principle of identity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;And then there's binocular vision: two perceptions of the same thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;at the same place and time, yet slightly different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: "Slightly different" is still different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Good grief. All your cases against holistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; identity are actually cases for it!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Please pay attention: two PERCEPTIONS, not two things perceived.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Two X is different than 1 X.<br>
