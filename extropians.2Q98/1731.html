The Greeks had the ability, for certain, but their spin on the scientific<br>
method was such that they saw no purpose in experimental proof of theories.<br>
After all, once you have figured Nature out in your mind, what point is<br>
there in getting messy by proving the truth? I particularly enjoyed reading<br>
Socrates' arguments for the existence of an immortal soul, based on his own<br>
personal experiences alone. No wonder the rulers of the time sought his<br>
death - he was as far from the pragmatic science of today as possible.<br>
<p>
Their 'inventions' were mostly used as special effects for their temples,<br>
to impress the common folk, or for toys. Persons who actually would dig<br>
into the mess to prove things were looked down on as mere mechanics and<br>
laborers.<br>
<p>
The Egyptians, I don't have good information on. Now I will have to go to<br>
the library again..<br>
