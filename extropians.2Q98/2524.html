You just don't get it, do you?  OK, try this on for size:<br>
<p>
B perceives A to be smaller than B.  A perceives B to be smaller than A.<br>
Who perceives other to be larger than self?  If the answer is "no one"<br>
(and it is!) thenthere is no positive sign on the identity chart.  Period.<br>
<p>
In one line, tell me in what reference frame A gets larger.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Has A gotten larger than B? The only </i><br>

<p>
As perceived by whom?  In what reference frame has A gotten larger?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The fact that both observers witness</i><br>

<i>&gt;   Both observers see themselves </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	  A  B   (how I appeared)</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	A 0  +</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	B +  0</i><br>
<p>
Did you make another error here?  "Both observers see themselves as<br>
larger than the other..."  0 is self, and 0 is SMALLER than +, not<br>
larger.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    and both observed the other as smaller:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	  B  A   (how the other appeared)</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	B 0  -</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	A -  0</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   and the sum of all valid measurements equals 0.</i><br>
<p>
The second chart is valid, but let's look at what the top row of your +<br>
identity chart is saying:  A percieves B to be larger than 0, and 0 is<br>
self. Therefore, A perceives B to be larger than self.<br>
<p>
*A DOES NOT PERCEIVE B TO BE LARGER THAN SELF.*<br>
<p>
Therefore, the above identity chart is wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Nice try Dan, but time to find another counter,</i><br>

<p>
How?  By refusing to understand special relativity?  Genius.  I should<br>
have thought of it earlier.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   If the size of A = 1 and the size of A</i><br>
<i>&gt;   = the size of B, but then B decreases</i><br>
<i>&gt;   in size to .5, it is a fact that 1 is</i><br>
<i>&gt;   LARGER than .5, and thus A has gotten</i><br>
<i>&gt;   larger relative to B because B got </i><br>
<i>&gt;   smaller relative to A. Simple.</i><br>
<p>
So simple, it's wrong.  Look, I want you to actually visualize this in a<br>
real way.  A's got a meter stick, which measures the same as B's meter<br>
stick at rest.  (They dynamically calculate this meter stick by finding<br>
the speed of light, and taking one three-hundred millionth of it.  This is<br>
the definition of a meter.)<br>
<p>
When they get moving, B's meter stick looks to be 0.8m long.  So, you want<br>
to say A's meter stick is growing?  Relative to what?  Not B: B perceives<br>
A's meter stick to be SHRINKING, not growing.  What is A growing relative<br>
to? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Because B was also size 1, it could </i><br>
<i>&gt;   be stated now that A = 1.5, for no</i><br>
<i>&gt;   point of size-reference is absolute.</i><br>
<p>
Except that this is true in no reference frame, for if you measure A from<br>
B's reference frame, you do NOT get 1.5: you get 0.5.  If someone, ANYONE,<br>
measured that meter stick to be 1.5m long, I'd agree.  Except A never<br>
measures any meter sticks to be longer than 1m, and neither does B.  So,<br>
from what reference frame is A 1.5m long?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: There is no absolute size, you cannot have </i><br>
<i>&gt;   "got smaller" free from "got larger." Observer </i><br>
<i>&gt;   A will measure the situation and see that there </i><br>
<i>&gt;   are two sides of the relative change: he himself </i><br>
<i>&gt;   got larger than B because B got smaller than A.</i><br>
<p>
Relative to WHAT?  A got larger relative to B?  &lt;BZZT&gt; No, A got SMALLER<br>
relative to B. Try again.<br>
<p>
Until you can provide a reference frame in which B grows (that is, from<br>
the perspective of observer X, B is 1.5m long) you haven't proved<br>
anything.  And unfortunately, from A's perspective all sticks are &lt;= 1m.<br>
Same for B.  And with that, you're out of perspectives.<br>
