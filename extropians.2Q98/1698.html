Thanks for the responses to my call for some detailed generation of near-term<br>
scenarios.  I spent some time systematically reviewing the responses this<br>
morning and, as always, I found that it helps to think together!  Some things<br>
pointed out by others seemed so obvious once I saw them.  Some examples:<br>
<p>
-- Mark Crosby reminded me of TELEVISION!  Pinpointing the time when this most<br>
influential of mass media begins to merge with what we now think of as PCs and<br>
the web will be an extremely important prognostication point.  I suppose I<br>
have thought about this as happening more effectively once consumer-level VR<br>
becomes ubiquitous, but an earlier merger could cause an acceleration of media<br>
tech developments simply because of the huge consumer power of the television<br>
viewing audience.<br>
<p>
-- Paul Hughes pointed out that the web, combined with increasing computer<br>
power might make "ecological accounting" a realistic near-term development.<br>
I'd encountered this idea before, but completely forgot about it in my first<br>
pass.  A comment: I think (1) the "greens" and the big accounting firms would<br>
have to work together somehow to develop some kind of GAAP with this idea<br>
before it became common and (2) some kind of market or governmental impetus<br>
would have to drive it before it was widely adopted.  Perhaps effective<br>
micropayments for resource handling would do the trick.<br>
<p>
-- In power technology, Paul Hughes also raised another point that slipped my<br>
mind, fuel cells.  I was always fascinated with this technology when I was a<br>
kid and it was used in the U.S. space program starting with Gemini and, more<br>
importantly, on Apollo.  (I can still locate the fuel cells in both<br>
spacecraft!)  I would like to know more about the state of the art and the<br>
near-term milestones that must be achieved for wide-spread implementation.<br>
<p>
I was also struck by how important cross-disciplinary views are.  The folks<br>
more oriented to computer technology seemed far less optimistic about things<br>
like bio-medical developments and, in the case of space technology, than<br>
folks, like "Spike Jones" and myself who appear to follow it more closely.<br>
The computer gods, such as the two Dans (Fabulich and Clemmensen), were<br>
consistently (although moderately) more optimistic on the development of<br>
computer speed and capacity.  In the case of space tech, the astonishing<br>
number of serious private launching ventures seem very likely to yield<br>
impressive advances in LEO and translunar development before 2010; yet much of<br>
this development is not widely known outside of the space industry and its<br>
ancillary cloud of enthusiasts.  <br>
<p>
This cross-disciplinary effect points to the continuing value of this list and<br>
the activities of the transhumanist and extropian community generally.  A key<br>
insight of the transhumanist vision is the importance of synergy between<br>
developing technologies.  Only by actively sharing information and informed<br>
speculation can we expect to maintain a clear vision of the future, whether we<br>
see it as a "spike" or a "swell".<br>
<p>
With these comments and bearing in mind the input received so far, I offer<br>
some speculation for the decade following 2005, although I abandon somewhat<br>
the format I had originally offered, in part because some disciplines will<br>
merge beyond their current meaningful categorical divisions:<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
2005 - 2015<br>
<p>
Computers/Media<br>
The VR Revolution is universally recognized in the first world: "virtual<br>
consumption" of many "luxury items" beginning to supplant "real consumption"<br>
(i.e. why pay $250k for a real Lamborghini when $100 gets you 80% of the<br>
experience with "Lambo 2.0"); Design of virtual environments and highly<br>
interactive scenarios becomes the principle artistic enterprise, significantly<br>
blurring the line between the "software engineering" and "artistic"<br>
communities; A large portion of business travel supplanted by virtual<br>
meetings; Social interaction in virtual environments becomes ubiquitous;<br>
Merging of VR into Chislenko ER "Enhanced Reality" in first world toward end<br>
of this period.<br>
The AI Revolution arrives: Toward the end of this period autonomous agents<br>
become important economic actors, treated as human agents are now in law and<br>
business; Industrial and product design and engineering become highly<br>
automated with the use of various species of AI assistants and agents.<br>
<p>
Biotechnology:<br>
Toward the end of this period, using bioinformatic techniques, large parts of<br>
the dynamic metabolic pathways leading up from the now-completely-mapped human<br>
genome through actual organic expression are understood, giving rise to<br>
effective genetic therapies for a majority of pathologies; Organ cloning is<br>
perfected and, toward 2015 implemented; Nerve regeneration is mastered, making<br>
whole body transplants feasible but as yet untested; Common pathologies are<br>
treated with same-day DNA chip diagnosis and gene therapy; At least one first<br>
world society (the EU dominated by the greens? The US dominated by religious<br>
fundamentalists?) completely rejects advanced biomedical techniques; Uploads<br>
still seem RELATIVELY remote, as emulation achieves small network level and<br>
scanning technology still unable to achieve massive fidelity.<br>
<p>
Industry/Materials:<br>
Smart materials pervasive in high-end products; Smart buildings universal for<br>
new construction in the first world; Programming/control continues to be major<br>
impediment to "Drextech", limiting molecular manufacturing to centralized<br>
materials construction only; Environmental degradation slows significantly as<br>
lower-impact manufacturing technologies continue to develop.<br>
<p>
Business/Finance:<br>
Virtual consumption causes proliferation of low-capital, high-flux, small<br>
enterprises characterized by fluid agency structure; "Agency management" model<br>
comes to predominate in many first-world businesses (management of human and<br>
AI agency resources); Market fluidity and decreasing transaction costs cause<br>
capital fund managers to dominate industrial leadership, creating increasing<br>
tensions between "planners/builders" and "profit-seekers".<br>
<p>
Society/Politics<br>
Single career paradigm in first world becomes minority lifestyle; Immigration<br>
pressure into the first world abates as employment opportunities for non-<br>
information workers stagnate and then decline; Industrial production (even<br>
with increased automation) increasingly concentrated in second and third world<br>
as a result; Fertility rates and energy consumption in the first world begin<br>
to decline as virtual consumption supplants "real" consumption;<br>
"Balkanization" of culture in the first world as virtual communities cross-cut<br>
geographic boundaries; Major reductions in violent crime and second and third<br>
world political tyrranies through implementation of "transparent society"<br>
techniques; Conflict between privacy and transparency dominates social and<br>
political agendas in first world; Development of a few Orwellian ultra-<br>
surveillance tyrannies in the second and third worlds (Iran? Iraq?); A few<br>
tech-terrorist incidents spark lightning super-smart weapon responses from<br>
coordinated first-world militaries.<br>
<p>
Law/Government<br>
Proliferation of quasi-governmental adjudicative agencies dovetailing with<br>
continued development and spread of smart contracts (primitive PPLs);<br>
Traditional state judiciary and government increasingly preoccupied with<br>
"info-torts" arising from conflict between transparency and privacy; Many late<br>
20th century NGOs (non-governmental organizations) mutate into quasi-<br>
governmental agencies (also identifiable as primitive non-territorial PPLs);<br>
Some first-world governments become preoccupied with legislation and<br>
regulation of biotech, others take laissez faire approach.<br>
<p>
Space:<br>
Human/robotics debate "resolved" as relatively small human presence is<br>
perceived as necessary for high-level management across light-speed gap, thus<br>
LEO manned station is only a way station to small human surface base managing<br>
lunar prospecting and construction of research facilities and manned orbital<br>
Mars facility is planned; Large growth in telerobotic LEO service industry for<br>
telecomm sats.<br>
<p>
Note that I continue to be conservative on advanced nanotechnology.  The<br>
informational load for full-blown assembler-based nanotech seems so high that<br>
many, many orders of magnitude of advance in capacity and, more importantly,<br>
very significant QUALITATIVE advances in computing ability will be necessary.<br>
Accordingly, I continue to see "ultimate Drextech" as coming after 2015,<br>
although how much later I don't think we can say.<br>
