<i>&gt; I am proposing an idea, and I would like to see if there's any enthusiam for</i><br>
<i>&gt; it among extropians.  In short, Project Star Net (PSN) would aim to establish</i><br>
<i>&gt; an interstellar communication network.  Right now PSN is still in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "thinking about it" stage, and I want to see if there's any interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; forming an organization to pursue this worthy goal.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I envision a station (or node) in each stellar system with powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; transmitters and receivers, thus allowing data to be relayed to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific destination, or propagated through the network as a general</i><br>
<i>&gt; broadcast.</i><br>
<p>
Why just one? I assume the energy needed for interstellar<br>
communication would be relatively manageable if it is properly<br>
collimated (no need for Forward's wonderful megascale lasers needed<br>
for fast interstellar solar sailing), so even if there are scale<br>
factors making it economic to have large transmittors there is likely<br>
no reason to have just one. The same goes for receivers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A major goal would be the translocation (or "faxing") of persons across the</i><br>
<i>&gt; network. </i><br>
<p>
Bandwidth, error correction and receipts will be important<br>
here. Assume a human mind takes around 10^15 bytes - that will require<br>
a quite large bandwidth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Because of the sheer size of the network and the associated netlag, it could</i><br>
<i>&gt; not be centrally managed.  In fact, once the first node is established, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Star Net should automatically manage and maintain itself, and launch "seeds"</i><br>
<i>&gt; to establish new nodes, thus replicating until it ultimately spans our entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; galaxy.  This will require a certain level of artificial intelligence.</i><br>
<p>
Charlie Stross has a StarNet-like network in his novel Scratch Monkey,<br>
where some of these issues are discussed. I recommend it, even if I am<br>
doubtful about some of his solutions (which on the other hand makes<br>
the novel more interesting). <br>
<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What is the most efficient way to launch "seed" probes across</i><br>
<i>&gt;      interstellar space?  Also, how small can such seeds be made?</i><br>
<p>
I have started writing up a nanotech seed for this purpose, I have a<br>
(not very finished or well planned) draft at<br>
<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/seed">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/seed</a><br>
<p>
My idea is to use a laser-driven solar sail to propel it, with perhaps<br>
a magsail to brake and a small solar sail for traveling<br>
in-system. Asteroids are seeded with nanomachines that build a<br>
receiver, which then recieves further instructions. My guess is that<br>
the whole seed would be fairly small, likely less than one meter or so<br>
(possibly much smaller).<br>
<p>
Maybe we could develop the draft together, hopefully with useful input<br>
from the list? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What types of star systems should be candidates for</i><br>
<i>&gt;      establishing nodes?</i><br>
<p>
Why not every system? There are likely asteroids everywhere, and extra<br>
capacity is likely a good idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What part or parts of the EM spectrum are suited to our use.</i><br>
<p>
My communications technology knowledge is limited, but I would guess<br>
we want short wavelengths for maximum bandwidth (drawback: requires<br>
more energy to send than long wavelengths). Lasers sound fine to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What are the practical limits of data throughput across</i><br>
<i>&gt;      interstellar distances?</i><br>
<p>
Intensity fall-off (eventually you reach a bad signal-noise ratio),<br>
dust and other obscuring stuff, alignment problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What are the data requirements of transmitting a person?  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;      if the traveller is enhanced with extra memory -- do you charge</i><br>
<i>&gt;      by the gigabyte, or have a fixed rate for everybody?</i><br>
<p>
Rough estimate: 10^11 neurons, 10^4 synapses each, five bytes per<br>
synapse (where it is connected, synaptic strength) = 5*10^15 bytes. If<br>
you want to scan the whole body, you will need *huge* amounts of<br>
bandwidth (remember, one mol is 10^23 atoms...). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What other types of data might be transmitted?  Free news,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      perhaps?</i><br>
<p>
Just look at the net - everything from net control messages over<br>
discussions to posthuman pornography (scantily clad jupiter brains?).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * How can access to the network be allocated fairly?</i><br>
<p>
I think the Internet model works fine: make it easy to connect, you<br>
only pay for your node in the network which both gives you access and<br>
acts as a part others can use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What is the most likely way to finance the project?</i><br>
<p>
Note that if you use reproducing probes, you only need to pay for the<br>
original probe, and then it will expand on its own giving a huge<br>
return of investment. A good start might be an interplanetary net.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * How will the network respond if it "bumps into" an alien</i><br>
<i>&gt;      civilization?</i><br>
<p>
Protocol trouble, but hopefully the SNETF (StarNet Engineering Task<br>
Force) is up to writing an adapter. Obviously, selfreproducing probes<br>
need to be given good emergency programming.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * If a star system is over-populated, can its inhabitants tell</i><br>
<i>&gt;      their station to refuse any new arrivals?  Are there other</i><br>
<i>&gt;      situations that could justify this option?  And what happens</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to the traveller who the station doesn't accept?</i><br>
<p>
Look at the net: an overloaded router tells the other routers that it<br>
is busy, and they route signals elsewhere. If travel is done by<br>
sending a copy of the traveller to the destination, keeping one copy<br>
inactive, and then waiting for a receipt (if received, delete the<br>
inactive copy, otherwise awaken it and tell it "sorry, access<br>
denied"), there is no big problem with occasional blocks. <br>
<p>
Stross has an interesting scenario in Scratch Monkey where some<br>
desperate people flee just by broadcasting themselves in the same<br>
direction, hoping they will be picked up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    * What kind of data security is required on transmissions?</i><br>
<i>&gt;      What degree of encryption, error correction, and redundancy</i><br>
<i>&gt;      is desirable?</i><br>
<p>
Error correction (= redundancy) is important. Encryption is best left<br>
to the application layer, although it might be a good idea if the<br>
nodes in the network use some autentification software. Sounds like<br>
conventional internetworking problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does it makes sense to form an official organization at this</i><br>
<i>&gt; point in time?</i><br>
<p>
I'm torn between "no" and "maybe". It would be interesting to think<br>
about the project, but it is still rather far in the future and the<br>
form of StarNet will be highly dependent on unknown future<br>
developments in information technology, nanotech and AI. I suggest the<br>
idea is developed further, and StarNet is designed to be an initial<br>
proposal others can refine. Then, in a few decades, it might be time<br>
to form the real organization.<br>
<p>
BTW, are there any standards yet for domain names in space?<br>
