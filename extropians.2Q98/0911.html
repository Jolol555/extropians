We've all heard the fears that manual laborers are too resistant to<br>
losing their jobs as a result of technological progress- what do we do<br>
with these people?  This is a relevant concern and one I don't wish to<br>
delve into, but instead I'd like to address the white-collar capitalists<br>
and their role in the scheme of things.  No, I'm not a<br>
socialist/Marxist/anarchist, and I certainly don't intend to bash<br>
capitalism as a system.  But the fact is, not only in America but<br>
increasingly overseas, businesses have been taught to push their<br>
products- to either fulfill a social need or create a desire for a new<br>
one.  My question is not "what do we do with these people?", but how the<br>
needs of humans/transhumans will evolve along with progressive<br>
automation.  How much of a public demand will be required for any given<br>
product to make it worthwhile to produce?  Exactly how much wealth will<br>
there be to go around?  What new forms of entertainment will arise out<br>
of the ashes of the market-driven archetypes?  As you can see, this is<br>
really more of a speculative question than a problem to be solved, and<br>
as such might be deemed to trivial to warrant attention by many, but I<br>
welcome comments from all interested parties.<br>
