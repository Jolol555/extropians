It shouldn't.  I simply find your method of "not ignoring" to be<br>
excessive.  I think you would have more luck if you tried a different<br>
approach.  There's an on-going fight between you and those who don't<br>
agree with you, and from my perspective you seem to be the one to<br>
provoke the fight.  As I said, I think you should put your ideas<br>
before upstaging those who don't agree with them.  Correct me if I'm<br>
wrong.<br>

<p>
Again, I'm terribly sorry - what I meant was to say, "this isn't<br>
getting you anywhere."  My post was a virtual 'glass of water in the<br>
face' to snap you out of it.<br>
