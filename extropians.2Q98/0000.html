<i>&gt; A list-member challenged the holistic-identity statement</i><br>

<i>&gt; about nature, unlike the atomist identity state-</i><br>
<i>&gt; ment X=X. That argument is perfectly false</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; and here is the proof...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  SCENARIO: There are two objects, A and B,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  traveling in different directions;</i><br>
<p>
Relative to what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  then the velocity of A is suddenly increased.</i><br>
<p>
Relative to what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  PROBLEM: Predict what happens to the velocity of B.</i><br>
<p>
Relative to what?<br>
<p>
Ian's argument assumes, without any justification, that the velocities<br>
of A and B are defined relative to each other.  That's a valid<br>
definition, but it's far from the only possible definition.  Both A and<br>
B have velocities relative to C, for example, which do *not* behave as<br>
Ian describes.<br>
<p>
This isn't the first time Ian has tried to wow us by with a proof <br>
based on assumptions that were not in the statement of the problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The X=X atomist-identity theory predicts that the velocity</i><br>
<i>&gt; of B is not altered, since an identity attribute, X, of B</i><br>
<i>&gt; (of which velocity is one) is X free from not-X, X=X.</i><br>
<p>
Who says velocity is an element of identity?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The X=X+~X holistic-identity theory predicts that the velocity</i><br>
<i>&gt; of B is altered exactly inverse to the alteration of the velocity</i><br>
<i>&gt; of A, since an identity attribute, X, of B is X only by relation</i><br>
<i>&gt; to A, so if the X of A increases relative to B, the X of B will</i><br>
<i>&gt; decrease in the exact proportion -- zero-sum conservation law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This prediction is true, and the atomist prediction is false.</i><br>
<p>
In other words, delta(|A-B|) = delta(|B-A|).  Whoopee.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ERGO: Not only does the holistic-identity theory allow us to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make an accurate prediction about the world prior to testing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the atomist-identity theory leads us directly to a FALSE</i><br>
<i>&gt; prediction about the nature of the physical world!</i><br>
<p>
When you get to define all terms, of course you can prove you're right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Relativity" simply defines the holism of identity and the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the identities of A and ~A overlap one another, in exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fashion that atomism denies by ignore-ance of the facts.</i><br>
<p>
If velocity is an element of identity, then there is no identity between<br>
A before acceleration and A after acceleration; and so one might ask how<br>
the above argument is relevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Identity is difference,</i><br>
<p>
Then why is it called by a word whose root means `same' ???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and difference is symmetrical,</i><br>
<p>
Once again Ian stands well-established usage on its head to get his way.<br>
A symmetric relation is one where R(A,B) implies R(B,A); for example, if<br>
I am taller than Ian, then Ian is taller than me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and thus identity is conserved,</i><br>
<p>
(except when it isn't; see above)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; which is to say (as I have proven) that net identity,</i><br>
<p>
(whatever that means)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or net difference, always equals zero.</i><br>
<p>
(A-B) + (B-A) = 0, yes; so what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Identity conservation: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/matrix.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/matrix.htm</a></i><br>
<p>
This web page shows something of which I was not fully aware until now:<br>
Ian confuses the vernacular meaning of identity (a property of a thing)<br>
with the mathematical meaning (the relation between a thing and itself<br>
or between two equal things).<br>
