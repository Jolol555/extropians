<i>&gt; &gt; Anyway, I think there's still one type of list missing: "transhumanism</i><br>
select":an<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invitation only (or in any case restricted) list for hardcore transhumanists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who decides who is worthy of invitation?  </i><br>
<p>
We could have a democratic vote ;-) Or use such guidelines as: membership<br>
of a (any) transhumanist organization, suspension contract, frequency<br>
of postings to the list etc, anything that indicates that this person takes<br>
transhumanism seriously, and isn't just some lurking journalist looking<br>
for a scandal, secret service guy looking for a bust, christian fanatic<br>
looking for a spam etc. It's meant as a protective measure, *not* some<br>
kind of elitism (for elitism, there's already the invitation-only Polymath <br>
list, for example). <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; And more importantly, what makes those who invite worthy of inviting? </i><br>
<p>
An open yet critical mind?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although I agree the intention of having an invite only</i><br>
<i>&gt; list will increase the overall level of dialogue, it will also have the opposite</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect of shielding out others who might have intelligent ideas to contribute.  </i><br>
<p>
There would still be the main free-or-all list, no ideas would have to be lost.<br>
Again, the proposed list is meant as a sort of free zone, where you can<br>
say anything without worrying about general transhuman PR. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Polymath list is a perfect case in point.  The level of discussion is intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; but also completely inbred.  </i><br>
<p>
I couldn't agree more (no offence, guys) ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't see much memetic evolution taking place there -</i><br>
<i>&gt; only the same ideas hashed over again, with an occasional new hypothesis to stir</i><br>
<i>&gt; things up.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's why discussions should be conducted as much as possible in the<br>
open, and only taken "backstage" when absolutely necessary. Nevertheless,<br>
right now we don't have a "backstage" (except for private email, which isn't<br>
too convenient for broader discussions), and it would be nice to have one,<br>
just in case.<br>
