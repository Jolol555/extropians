Thanks for the nod, Dan.  But I'm a bit worried about the way you've<br>
adapted my term `spike'.  Really I just meant it as an quick and<br>
media-memorable synonym for Vinge's `Technological Singularity'.  While<br>
both he and you certainly expect a drastic rupture to happen very swiftly,<br>
I think the key postulate is just that exponential change creates a wall or<br>
horizon beyond which we cannot see or even usefully speculate.  I don't<br>
myself think this rupture will happen literally overnight, or even within a<br>
year (but who can know in advance?).  Like all horizons, the Spike will<br>
recede as we approach it.  From here, it looks like a looming wall - we<br>
can't see if it's swelling or jutting straight up out of the ground. Either<br>
way, it will change everything for ever.  I hope I can hold my poor<br>
decaying body together long enough for the swell to carry me up the spike.<br>
<p>
BTW (plug time), people can order THE SPIKE from<br>
