Vegetarian dinosaurs couldn't eat the good stuff most modern vegetarians eat, <br>
grass, because grass had not evolved yet, their main diet was something  <br>
similar to pine needles, and you need to eat about twice as much to get equal <br>
food value. That's not the only problem, pine needles take far longer to <br>
digest than grass. Also, the teeth of these dinosaurs were simple pegs, they<br>
didn't have anything like molar teeth that modern animals use to grind up <br>
there vegetable food before swallowing, they had to swallow their pine <br>
needles whole. All this means that if you want to make a living in this way <br>
you're going to need a very large stomach and gut, the rest of the body will <br>
be scaled up proportionally. You end with something like a huge fermentation<br>
tank with legs.<br>
 <br>
Another reason we don't see land animals as big as the largest dinosaurs is <br>
simply chance, nearly all the species of animals that have ever existed are <br>
extinct, there is no reason to expect we'd be lucky enough to be around at the <br>
same time the very largest ones were. We were extraordinary lucky as far as <br>
sea animals are concerned, no beast has ever been as large as the Blue Whale.<br>
