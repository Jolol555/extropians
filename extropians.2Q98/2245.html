<i>&gt; You probably wouldn't use it instead of your normal professional channels,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but rather in addition. Here are a couple of ways it might benefit you:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. If this goes the route of propogating certain messages to other nodes</i><br>
<i>&gt; that may be interested, you get improved interdisciplinary sharing of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas.</i><br>
<p>
That is a good point.  Implementation may be tough. To be effective, <br>
this will require a lot of work by NodeMasters in order to ensure that <br>
the quantity and level of interdisciplinary communication is  <br>
appropriate, along with some oversight to ensure that the NodeMasters are <br>
doing their jobs properly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. You get to talk to lay-persons who have the sort of interest in your</i><br>
<i>&gt; work that is all too rare among the general public, while at the same time</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking to colleagues.</i><br>
<p>
"At the same time" is not necessarily a good idea.  Separate forums may <br>
be appropriate.  To pick just one example which I am quite familiar with, <br>
the sci.physics.* Usenet groups tend to be fairly useless for physics.  <br>
This is because, ironically, many of the better informed posters seem to <br>
spend their time helping out the inexperienced, while discussion of <br>
"advanced topics" is dominated by enthusiastic but poorly informed people.<br>
<p>
For this reason, I believe that some sort of stratification is <br>
necessary if the system is to be attract usage by innovators.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3. You get to set the record straight. What gets passed off as "science</i><br>
<i>&gt; reporting" on TV and in the papers these days is really inadequate as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; conduit between the lab and the living room.</i><br>
<p>
As the Boston Globe example shows. Let me also add that the New Scientist <br>
link about quantum teleportation posted recently was woefully misleading. <br>
Anything NodeNet can do to improve this link would be great!<br>
<p>
I will make a few related suggestions about NodeNet in my reply to Sarah's <br>
post.<br>
