That most happen during takeoffs in bad weather, and during approaches<br>
(which indicates nothing, as a plane with a major failure that can try to<br>
make it back to an airfield is said to crash on landing, even though the<br>
root cause may have happened a while back) is true, in which case, some<br>
sore of personal attenuation device, like a full body airbag, would<br>
probably work much better. Of course, you'd need ejection seats for<br>
everyone to get them away from the plane quickly...<br>
<p>
Increasing air travel safety is best focused on a few areas:<br>
<p>
a) aircraft system reliability (already VERY HIGH, and not likely to<br>
improved much on.)<br>
b) education, training, and experience of pilots (something which is sorely<br>
lacking in many foreign pilots, whose major cause of crashes involves poor<br>
English skills, which is the internation language of air traffic control).<br>
With cheap computer simulations, the requirements for simulator time for<br>
commercial pilots should be much higher than it is.<br>
c) reducing the flammability of aircraft interior materials<br>
d) reducing the vaporization of fuel in the event of a crash<br>
e) increasing the amount of, the maintenance of, and the accuracy of<br>
takeoff and landing navigation systems<br>
f) building into passenger seats some sort of automatically deploying<br>
environment suit, possibly with attenuation capability, which will protect<br>
the passenger against smoke, ignition of vaporized fuel, and minor high<br>
speed airborn objects.<br>
