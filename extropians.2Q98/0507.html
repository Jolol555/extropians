Sometimes I have to wonder about Ettinger's motivations, though. As I<br>
understand it, in Michigan, where CI is located, there are strict laws<br>
prohibiting anyone who is not a mortician from performing the kind of<br>
work necessary for a cryopreservation. <br>
<p>
Of course, there are workarounds for this (become a mortician, do the<br>
work out of state, as I'm sure much of it already is), but you have to<br>
wonder, though.<br>
<p>
Since CI has such a fat bankroll as compared to the other orgs, it<br>
would sure be nice if they would really fund some real research.<br>
