<p>
As I explained knowledge is neither defined as true or false, the only<br>
attribute of knowledge is that it produces more knowledge and/or<br>
information.  For instance, creationism is not knowledge since it does<br>
not create any new knowledge or information (it nicely snuffs it) and<br>
it is neither provably true nor false.  Science uses an evolutionary<br>
model because it creates new knowledge/information (and therefore is<br>
knowledge) and it is neither provably true nor false.  The fact that<br>
evolutionary theory works does not make it true, and certainly does<br>
not make creationist theory false.<br>
<p>
[BTW, I doubt Creationism has no grounding as science.  We will soon<br>
be creating life, consciousness, worlds and maybe even new<br>
"universes."  If we have the power to do this, what are the chances<br>
that we are not the creation of another intelligence?  (That question<br>
will become even more profound when our artificial universes start<br>
building artificial universes of their own).  It's even possible an<br>
inferior intelligence set the algorithm running that in turn created<br>
us.  I would even argue it's possible that we were created the other<br>
day (or next week) and yet we cannot know.  But could we ever<br>
communicate with our creator?  Again, it's a possibility.  Of course,<br>
this is far from worshipping God as our one true saviour (but even<br>
then, I'm sure an egotistical super intelligence will create a world<br>
where his worship *is* the only salvation - it could be the next big<br>
thing in posthuman entertainment).]<br>
