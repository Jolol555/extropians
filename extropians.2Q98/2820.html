Yes, America has become a frightening place to live since the asset<br>
forfeiture laws were passed. Or were you unaware that anyone can have their<br>
assets seized at any time on suspicion of having committed a crime?<br>
<p>
Here's a recent example:<br>
<p>
Back in 1994 a Syrian immigrant wanted to fly to Syria carrying $350,000<br>
in cash to repay the friends and relatives who'd invested in his profitable<br>
gas station business. Because he was scared that it might be siezed by<br>
corrupt Syrian customs officials he chose not to fill in the mandatory<br>
reporting forms for exports of more than $10,000 in cash.<br>
<p>
Sadly, he forgot about all those corrupt US customs officials; they found<br>
the money, and seized it all on the grounds that they thought it might,<br>
possibly, perhaps, maybe have been raised by criminal means.<br>
<p>
Four years and many legal bills later later the Supreme Court have finally <br>
decided that the money didn't come from a crime and returned about $330,000 <br>
to him (keeping the rest as a fine for not filing the report). But, oops! <br>
The IRS just sent him a bill for $330,000 in back taxes. Not that they've <br>
done an audit or found any evidence that he owes any, it's just an IRS <br>
decision based on... uh, um, ah... a hunch, I guess. That it's within a <br>
few thousand dollars of the amount the Supreme Court returned to him is<br>
just 'one of them coincidences'. Of course.<br>
<p>
Now do you see why so many of us find these claims that Clinton's rights<br>
are being abused so laughable? He's getting kid glove treatment compared<br>
to ordinary Americans.<br>
<p>
And maybe some of the others on the list will realise why we're so opposed<br>
to letting governments track us at will.<br>
