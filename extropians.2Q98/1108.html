    In the 'forteana' conference today, I found this contribution, which <br>
makes me kinda sad.  We fought the Cold War for this?  The essay follows <br>
on from an idyllic description of his home, about fifty miles outside New <br>
York, where the rich drink Dom Perignon and the dogs have $10 000 <br>
jewelled collars..<br>
<p>
I guess I could write the same story on life hereabouts.  Idylls and <br>
infernos in uncomfortably close proximity.<br>
<p>
      God help us all....<br>

This, and the retrieval of cigarette butts to gather roll and smoke is<br>
depressing but NOT new or "news", I say with some hesitation for fear of<br>
sounding like some cynical hardass.<br>
<p>
   We can all clinically view the statistics with regards to the steady<br>
shift of society's wealth to the already wealthy, while coolly ignoring the<br>
encroaching results of the same on the working poor right outside our door<br>
(or under our own roofs, truly), the low income elderly tenant whose rental<br>
unit gets sold out from  them in an exploding urban real estate market, the<br>
immigrant laborer sharing the one-room apartment with 14 other adults while<br>
working multiple jobs to share the fruits of this better new world with<br>
their families in explosive nations to the south and overseas,  the obscene<br>
"War on Drugs" which makes it so that students and poor artists, the folks<br>
who really need it,  cannot even afford simple cannibis anymore.<br>
<p>
   I have had friends who worked in food service here in San Francisco at<br>
the fanciest hotels and restaurants where the cast-off food is dumped into<br>
secure dumpsters where the nearby starving are kept at bay. Of course there<br>
are the occasional well-publicized redistribution efforts usually given a<br>
great deal of lip service around the Xmas holiday season when people are<br>
more easily moved(read:"manipulated") by guilt. At the other end of the<br>
scale, some "hippier" restaurants and bakeries have set up their own free<br>
boxes or redistribution efforts.<br>
<p>
   Even as the disparity becomes more obscene and  shows no sign of<br>
reversing (interms of the size and irrepairability of the gap between the<br>
rich and poor) I still believe (while knowing full well the deep danger of<br>
"belief") that the problem is one of distribution of goods and energy, that<br>
there are enough resources and possible options available to solve a lot of<br>
the gross iniquities that plague our clumsy dominion over this planet and<br>
our neighboring species. But I am certainly not prepared or equipped to<br>
make those grand changes, but the potential keeps me from giving up hope<br>
while struggling amidst the squalor and disregard.<br>
<p>
      I am not naiive enough to suggest that this trite plague is only an<br>
urban American problem; that aspect of the issue is just more obvious to<br>
me (as is Nem's reflections on the lush divinity of the endangered<br>
rainforest) and I am also blessed to have nearby  my home in this congested<br>
overpriced and depressed metropolis a protected piece of rare open space, a<br>
grassy rocky hill to which  I am pleasantly obligated to take my canine<br>
companion at least twice a day, where she is allowed to run leash-free with<br>
others of her species and socialize in ways that a lot of country dogs and<br>
suburban dogs with big old yards to defend never get the opportunity to. <br>
<p>
   If rather than taking that short walk to the hilltop I was to turn right<br>
and walk out my door, the street one block down has the late 20th century<br>
version of Bunuel's "Land Without Bread" being reenacted by the occupants<br>
of the Asylum of St. Francis , and the web of freeway overpasses that  one<br>
can see to the east of my little doggy hilltop provides a concrete roof for<br>
a small shifting tribe of broken(mostly) men, walking the streets by night<br>
and sleeping(dead?) wrapped in plastic and filthy blankets by day to lessen<br>
the danger of assault by other homeless. Oh look, there's an emaciated<br>
prostitute somebody beat the skull in of...third one this week... above us<br>
the ribbon of steel and cement carries individuals on cellular phones, each<br>
in their own Lexxus or BMW or sports utility vehicle putzing slowly but<br>
safely in a cloud of skyborne (but lead-free!) toxins into the city of<br>
banks restaurants and nightclubs.<br>
<p>
   To see someone broken, hopeless, with all their possessions in a cart is<br>
an allegedly noteworthy observation? I don't think so. It might have been<br>
novel when I was  kid in the deficit free early 60's in the USA but I think<br>
that was an exceptional time,  from what I've seen of the struggles of my<br>
progenitors and those of much older countries/societies than my own.    <br>
<p>
      I saw this beautifully interesting little old man on the street the<br>
other day, in these mismatched pants/coat with this crazy furry<br>
burgermeister hat w/feather on it and thought to myself: " I want to have<br>
that much eccentric character and style when I'm his age." I then watched<br>
as he dug around in the trash for aluminum cans, I suppose, then poked his<br>
finger into the coin slot on the payphone hoping for some change. Something<br>
to look forward to I suppose.<br>
<p>
  Underneath the cold grey shadows of the modern crossroads, tenaciously<br>
refusing to stop living, sitting on their filthy behinds holding their<br>
poisoned heads in their broken hands...what bargain will they strike in<br>
their daily prayer thinking it their last chance? And with which god?<br>
<p>
              cheerfully, Joe<br>
