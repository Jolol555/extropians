AS&gt; Why just one? I assume the energy needed for interstellar<br>
AS&gt; communication would be relatively manageable if it is properly<br>
AS&gt; collimated (no need for Forward's wonderful megascale lasers needed<br>
AS&gt; for fast interstellar solar sailing), so even if there are scale<br>
AS&gt; factors making it economic to have large transmittors there is likely<br>
AS&gt; no reason to have just one. The same goes for receivers.<br>
<p>
What about signal interference?  I assume we have limited EM bandwidth to work<br>
with.  You probably can't directionally distinguish signals from two stations<br>
at interstellar distances.  So, I reckon the most efficient way is to have one<br>
directional transmitter and receiver for each adjacent node your station is<br>
linked to.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; Bandwidth, error correction and receipts will be important<br>
AS&gt; here. Assume a human mind takes around 10^15 bytes - that will require<br>
AS&gt; a quite large bandwidth.<br>
<p>
Indeed so.  But I'm not sure how much EM bandwidth we have to work with, in<br>
practical terms.  This could be important to know, in terms of predicting what<br>
sort of capacity the network will have.  Potential investors would want to<br>
know what sort of return to expect on their investment, for example.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; I have started writing up a nanotech seed for this purpose, I have a<br>
AS&gt; (not very finished or well planned) draft at<br>
AS&gt; <a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/seed">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/seed</a><br>
<p>
Thanks, I will check that out!<br>
<p>
AS&gt; Maybe we could develop the draft together, hopefully with useful<br>
AS&gt; input from the list? <br>
<p>
That sounds good to me.<br>
<p>
TB&gt;&gt;    * What types of star systems should be candidates for<br>
TB&gt;&gt;      establishing nodes?<br>
<p>
AS&gt; Why not every system? There are likely asteroids everywhere, and extra<br>
AS&gt; capacity is likely a good idea.<br>
<p>
There may be practical obstacles.  I would not jump to the assumption that<br>
asteroids are everywhere.  Our own solar system resembled a demolition derby<br>
in its early history, but that might not be typical at all.<br>
<p>
As many as 80% of all stars are part of multiple star systems.  The orbital<br>
mechanics that are possible in these systems are rather mysterious.  Nobody<br>
knows if those systems can contain asteroids or planets at all -- and even if<br>
they do, the orbits might be so eccentric that establishing a station and<br>
keeping it running would be impractical.<br>
<p>
Finally, a large majority of stars (I forget the exact statistic) are brown<br>
dwarfs that may represent dark, cold, energy-starved planetary systems where<br>
operations would be limited, and hardly anyone would want to visit anyhow. <br>
These are really what I was thinking about when I asked the question.  You've<br>
got all these zillions of "dark stars" that are hard to even detect and don't<br>
seem like they have much to offer.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; My communications technology knowledge is limited, but I would guess<br>
AS&gt; we want short wavelengths for maximum bandwidth (drawback: requires<br>
AS&gt; more energy to send than long wavelengths). Lasers sound fine to me.<br>
<p>
Lasers?  Can you distinguish the signal from the glare of the star that your<br>
transmitter is orbiting?  You said something about signal/noise ratios, but<br>
the star itself could be the biggest source of noise around.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; I think the Internet model works fine: make it easy to connect, you<br>
AS&gt; only pay for your node in the network which both gives you access and<br>
AS&gt; acts as a part others can use.<br>
<p>
I don't understand at all what you're saying here.  Pay for your node?  What<br>
does that mean?  The nodes are self-constructing and self-maintaining!<br>
<p>
I considered an idea that each node would manage its own economic system by<br>
issuing virtual "tokens" of some sort.  These would be issued regularly --<br>
say, once a month -- and would be valid during that time period.  Sort of a<br>
"use it or lose it" situation.  Anybody could sign up to recieve one token per<br>
month.  Investors would automatically get extra tokens.  Then the tokens can<br>
be traded among different people, and used to bid for transmittor access.<br>
<p>
(NOTE: It only makes sense to bid for transmission, not incoming data.  With a<br>
time lag of years between stations, it's not too practical to request<br>
something from another node.  You couldn't have anything like WWW, or at least<br>
not within reasonable time-lag limits.)<br>
<p>
If the station is located in a star system where material resources are scant,<br>
it could issue access tokens to buy what it needs from the inhabitants.<br>
<p>
So, if you were a non-investor in an otherwise un-inhabited star system, you<br>
could sign up for your one "free" token, and that would be enough to buy<br>
passage to somewhere else.  After all, nobody is bidding against you for<br>
access.  On the other hand, if you were in a populated star system with lots<br>
of network usage, your one token wouldn't be enough to ride.  You could either<br>
sell it to somebody, or you could buy enough tokens from other people to get a<br>
passage.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; Note that if you use reproducing probes, you only need to pay for the<br>
AS&gt; original probe, and then it will expand on its own giving a huge<br>
AS&gt; return of investment. A good start might be an interplanetary net.<br>
<p>
I don't think "return on investment" can have the usual meaning in this<br>
instance.  I mean, it doesn't matter how many nodes are created, the investor<br>
can only benefit from the one in the star system where he's currently located.<br>
 <br>
<p>
An interplanetary net would be fundamentally different, since it could exist<br>
within the bounds of a single economy.  You can't really have an interstellar<br>
economy for the same reason you can't have an interstellar government: the<br>
distances are simply too great.  There's no interchange of resources.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; Look at the net: an overloaded router tells the other routers that it<br>
AS&gt; is busy, and they route signals elsewhere.<br>
<p>
That's only helpful if you're making a transmission across long distances. <br>
I'm assuming, or guessing, that most people faxing themselves on the network<br>
would want to go directly to an adjacent node.  Then re-routing can't help. <br>
Also, if a node has any kind of failure, it can take adjacent nodes /years/ to<br>
find out about it, and they are transmitting data all that time!<br>
<p>
AS&gt; If travel is done by sending a copy of the traveller to the destination,<br>
AS&gt; keeping one copy inactive, and then waiting for a receipt (if received,<br>
AS&gt; delete the inactive copy, otherwise awaken it and tell it "sorry, access<br>
AS&gt; denied"), there is no big problem with occasional blocks. <br>
<p>
That would be really rough, wouldn't it?  You were going to visit Alpha<br>
Centauri, then you wake up and find NINE YEARS have passed and you're still<br>
here, because the A. Centauri station refused to accept you for some reason. <br>
Obviously, this is a type of failure we would like to avoid as much as<br>
possible.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; BTW, are there any standards yet for domain names in space?<br>
<p>
Not that I'm aware of.  A whole lot of new domain names are supposed to come<br>
into service real soon now, so maybe there's something.<br>
