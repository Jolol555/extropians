: a reason for their attitude were a sufficient source.  ...<br>
<p>
Consider context.  When such a statement is made, seems to me it's usually<br>
in response to a threat *to property* (rather than, say, life or limb).<br>
Given your open hostility to individualism in general, and in particular<br>
to the notion of leaving others in peace to enjoy what they've worked for<br>
in good faith, it's no wonder that you run into a lot of macho snarling<br>
on the same subject.<br>
<p>
But that's all talk, not behavior.  Here is a statement about my own<br>
behavior.  I have twice (I think) picked up my gun "in anger", both<br>
times at night: when a woman's voice called for help, and when something<br>
in my kitchen made loud noises and frightened the cat.  (In the former<br>
case, somebody threw a punch or two in a quarrel over parking; it was<br>
all over before I reached the scene.  The noise in the kitchen was<br>
raccoons; they fled my light.)  Assuming I'm not lying, would you<br>
like to infer anything from these anecdotes?<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
: &gt;Of course, the environment determines which behaviors are beneficial.<br>
: &gt;A market environment rewards giving; a socialist environment rewards taking.<br>
:<br>
: A market environment rewards giving. Really. That's why more money flows<br>
: from the developing countries to the industrial countries than vice versa.<br>
: They just like to give.<br>
<p>
Irrelevant on two counts.  If both parties benefit from trade, it's worse<br>
than pointless to quibble which benefits more.  But more importantly,<br>
which "developing" (ha) countries have you in mind, that have genuine<br>
market economies - where the dictator hasn't got a monopoly of everything<br>
that might be valuable?<br>
<p>
: That's why the US have one of the highest crime rates in the world.<br>
: The criminals just like to give (what? fear? hatred? death?).<br>
<p>
As a nation of immigrants, we have an excess of young single males,<br>
the class most likely to be criminals.  Still, most ethnic groups here<br>
are more peaceful than their counterparts back home (or so I've heard),<br>
and our crime rate had been dropping for decades (even through the Great<br>
Depression!) before Big Brother got serious about suppressing the market<br>
(oo, that nasty word again) in specialty pharmaceuticals.<br>
<p>
: That's why big capital eats little capital, little capital likes to give.<br>
<p>
No, silly, *big* capital likes to give bribes ("campaign contributions")<br>
to legislators, to make life harder for little capital.  Such giving is,<br>
unfortunately, rewarded.<br>
<p>
The degree to which "big capital eats little capital" is exaggerated, <br>
of course.  A merger of dinosaurs makes headlines; its subsequent<br>
loss of market share to upstarts is ignored.<br>
<p>
: The workers like to give, too, with their net wages and standard of living<br>
: declining.<br>
<p>
Which is why we're so much poorer than our great-grandparents, eh?<br>
<p>
: They all give. But who takes?<br>
<p>
That's the beauty of the market: you take by giving.<br>
