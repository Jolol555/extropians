both scooby doo and johny quest are still being shown on cartoon network,<br>
at least in europe they are. i used to watch them when I was a kid, though<br>
mainy for linguistical reasons (as an adolescent rather, then), preferred<br>
top cat actually because of that :-).<br>

<i>&gt;we will all likely agree that extropian memes spread and mutate</i><br>
<i>&gt;much more readily among the young, which interests me in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;concepts to be found in childrens literature.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;there was a cartoon in about the late 60s-early 70s (tho my childhood</i><br>
<i>&gt;memories are dim) about a talking dog and four teenagers who went</i><br>
<i>&gt;about solving crimes and such:  scooby doo.   recently it occurred</i><br>
<i>&gt;to me that the dog and the dumb guy were superstitious, whereas the</i><br>
<i>&gt;smart ones solved the mysteries using logic and reason.  there was always a</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural</i><br>
<i>&gt;logical explanation to everything in the end, whereas the bad guys were</i><br>
always<br>
<i>&gt;trying to scare them away using techniques that were effective only on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the superstitious non-logical players.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;there was another show called johnny quest, where johnny and his</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientist father and companions go about saving the world, again</i><br>
<i>&gt;thru technological means.  they would always overcome techno-evildoers</i><br>
<i>&gt;by producing a still more sophisticated technological solution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;i salute the creators of these childrens shows.  perhaps it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;partially thru their influence that my thinking is extropian today,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this philosphy being a natural extention of the anti-superstitious</i><br>
<i>&gt;techno-can-do-ism of scooby doo and johnny quest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(sorry max more, i suspect both of these shows were before your time... {8^D</i><br>
<i>&gt;spike)</i><br>
