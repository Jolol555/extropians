(a very nice overview!)<br>
<i>&gt; intention</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's easy to stray off the path.  You can prepare yourself by having</i><br>
<i>&gt; directions that will take you from wherever you back to where you need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be.</i><br>
<p>
This is a good idea. I like to make "to do/maybe" lists - list of<br>
things to do (often branched, with subtasks marked) and things I maybe<br>
should do. It is very good feedback to see what I have done (already<br>
checked) and what is possible to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; awareness</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Concentration requires being in a certain state of consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuously for the desired amount of time.</i><br>
<p>
It is also useful to learn to recognize when one is wandering or have<br>
slipped out of the right kind of state; this can be surprisingly hard<br>
to notice sometimes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; alertness</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Drugs are cool.  I am, therefore I think.  Caffeine will skyrocket you into</i><br>
<i>&gt; frenzied chaos, but will leave you too scattered to keep your wits.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; proper amounts, however, it is beneficial.</i><br>
<p>
Caffeine seems to promote rapid, well-trained actions but makes you<br>
less efficient at tasks requiring uncertain decisions, creativity or<br>
fluid thinking. But the personal variations are great, and seems to<br>
depend on the baseline level of arousal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; determination</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tell yourself you will never give up, and you will take yourself more</i><br>
<i>&gt; seriously.  I once struggled trying to learn a piano piece for 3 hours</i><br>
<i>&gt; straight.  It was frustrating at first, but it got easier once my brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; realized I meant serious business and was not going to leave the piano for</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few hours.  The temptation of scrapping it all and doing something else</i><br>
<i>&gt; is severe, especially if the task at hand is challenging.  Having infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; patience is difficult, yet simple if one keeps one's priorities straight.</i><br>
<i>&gt; One of my favorite original quotes:  "The more patience you have, the less</i><br>
<i>&gt; patience you'll need."</i><br>
<p>
Of course, the hardest thing is to train oneself to achieve better<br>
determination. Any ideas on that?<br>
