I can't see a situation where it would be safe and practical for the<br>
passengers in a commercial jet to put on parachutes and jump out.<br>
It would take a long time to get everyone strapped in and out of the<br>
airplane.  Few emergencies reveal themselves far enough in advance that<br>
this could be done.<br>
<p>
Jumping out of a jet is not going to be very safe.  Jets tend to fly<br>
a lot faster than planes normally do when dropping parachuters.  There<br>
may not be a good place to jump out from, and you could be blown into<br>
the wings or engines.  Parachuting itself requires some skill, so that<br>
you don't release the chute while tumbling and become entangled in it.<br>
Then, as was mentioned, there is the issue of landing and being rescued.<br>
<p>
All in all it seems very unlikely that this would be a practical method<br>
to save lives.<br>
