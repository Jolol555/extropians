Reading comprehension time: "as far as I can see they're just optical <br>
illusions *like Hoagland's pyramid image*." How could that sentence<br>
possibly be referring to Hoagland's image and not the Viking image<br>
you pointed out?<br>

It didn't; there are no five-sided pyramids, because several of the <br>
'edges' in the Viking images clearly do not exist except as optical <br>
illusions.<br>
