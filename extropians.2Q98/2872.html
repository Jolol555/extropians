<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I believe that older people tend to commit fewer violent crimes (and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;just those who are in hospital beds). If true, this might be turned into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;cultural-effects argument in favor of extending our lifespans. If violent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;crime primarily comes from youngsters, the more older people there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;and the lower the birth rate, the lower the level of violent crime that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;should expect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your belief is bolstered by fact.  I remember reading a SA article several</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; years ago that linked the number of teenagers (as a percentage of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; population) with the rise and fall in the incidence of violent crime in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; US.  Unfortunately, I don't remember which issue it was in; you could try</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a search on their web-site though.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To establish the relationship between age and violence, one would need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to eliminate other age-related factors.  I believe that wealth increases</i><br>
<i>&gt; with age.  I believe that a lack of money is the leading cause of</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence.  Persons with money resort to violence less often to obtain</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they need or desire.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Before promoting advanced age as a PR point, consider the negative PR</i><br>
<i>&gt; that advanced age may bring to mind.</i><br>
<p>
There is also the factor that crime tends to be higher in welfare states that<br>
limit support to males beyond childhood. Once the boys grow up and can't live off<br>
the welfare trough, which they have been raised to beleive they are 'entitled'<br>
to, they certainly are pissed.<br>
<p>
There is also another physiological/environmental factor at work. Lead ingestion<br>
in childhood has been difinitively linked with agressive behaviors and higher<br>
incidence of criminal activity. Since homes that still have lead paint in them<br>
(which children are prone to eat because the lead compound tastes sweet) are<br>
typically occupied by poor people, poor people tend to have a higher incidence of<br>
criminal records than more affluent people. However, there is an additional<br>
factor at work. Researchers have often wondered why rural poor people, though<br>
just as likely to live in lead paint infested dwellings, have a lower incidence<br>
of criminal records than urban poor. One contributing factor may be the use of<br>
fluoridation in drinking water. A recent study shows that flouridated water will<br>
increase the human body's ability to absorb lead from the digestive tract, thus<br>
raising the body's level of lead for a given diet of lead paint. So poor people<br>
growing up in rural lead painted homes with sources of drinking water that are<br>
not flouridated are going to have a lower average lead level in their body than<br>
urban poor people, and thus have a lower agression level, and liklihood of<br>
commiting violence.<br>
<p>
As to the age connection, one can simply look at it as a process of elimination.<br>
Young violent offenders typically commit violence against other violent<br>
offenders. By the time they are old, the most violent have been killed off, put<br>
in jail for life, while the smart ones have gotten away with it and might have<br>
learned their lesson. So older folk are less likely to be violent because the<br>
members of their generation that were violent are already dead.<br>
