<p>
Depends on what you classify as "meaningful," I'd say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Within an animal</i><br>
<i>&gt;society, even dyads and trios, indivduals must conform to a social code</i><br>
<i>&gt;which obviously, however, differs from our social code.</i><br>
<p>
Anthropomorphizing a bit, aren't we?  The behaviors animals adopt towards<br>
one another are genetically based and not at all memetic, which I'd say is<br>
a prerequisite for any meaningful definition of a social code.  Why not try<br>
Dawkins's _Selfish Gene_?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you are saying</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we can not "contract" animals into conforming into our social code</i><br>
<i>&gt;you are right but it is silly to even suggest that. Actually, I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is outright wrong in the egocentric human sense to think that everyone and</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing should conform to self.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think everything should conform to humanity.  Animals are not at<br>
all human, nor would I expect them to be so.  My whole point is that<br>
animals have no qualms over killing one another if it is in their own self<br>
interest, and that they would continue to do so if we chose to respect<br>
their utility.<br>
<p>
(To this extent, animals are MORE ruthless than humans: at least some of<br>
the humans think they're killing for a noble cause.  A dubious distinction,<br>
but worth noting.)<br>
<p>
What it boils down to is this:  by respecting animal rights, the animals<br>
have everything to gain, and we have everything to lose.  Think about all<br>
the goods which we use and work with which have been taken away from the<br>
use of animals.  The cities we work in were once wilderness which housed<br>
animals.  The food we eat is grown on farms which were once prairies.  The<br>
highways have paved over buffalo trails.  The woodlands, the swamplands,<br>
the open plains, even the deserts were first held by animals; to take from<br>
them and theirs would be to deprive them of any meaningful sense of private<br>
property.<br>
<p>
And what do we have to gain by respecting such rights?  Nothing, unless you<br>
gain a whole lot of utility from depriving yourself of almost all of the<br>
technological advances mankind has ever wrought.  In this case, it seems<br>
that we suffer from at best a zero sum game, if not a net utility LOSS for<br>
respecting animal rights.<br>
<p>
HUMANS get around this problem through contract and cooperation, but<br>
animals cannot be contracted; it is silly to suggest that they could be.<br>
Nor can they cooperate with humans in a way which respects the life,<br>
liberty and property of others.  I will stand by this point until you can<br>
find me an animal which understands and respects property rights.  (Not<br>
urinating indoors does not count.)  And unless animals are prepared to<br>
respect human rights, it seems morally dubious that humans should respect<br>
animal rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Furthermore, animals only kill others for</i><br>
<i>&gt;food or defense.</i><br>
<p>
I would not find it at all acceptable if you killed another human, even if<br>
you ate them afterwards.  (In fact, especially not in that case.)  So why<br>
exactly should we grant animals the same license?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are two and only two species that kill others of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the same kind in a ruthless manner. Ironically, they are very related</i><br>
<i>&gt;species, chimpanzees and humans (See Richard Wrangham's Demonic Males)</i><br>
<p>
Some humans are ruthless.  Some aren't.  Personally, I'm proud to be a<br>
member of the human race, happy to be alive, and don't consider myself<br>
"egocentric" for thinking so.  How about you?<br>
