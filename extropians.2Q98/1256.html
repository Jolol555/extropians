<i> &gt; I agree.  Frankly I find you all terribly boring and hold many of you</i><br>

<p>
A classical case of the pot calling the kettle black.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; about grammatical errors and authors promoting new books, there's a</i><br>
<i> &gt; brightly shinning gem.  And it's those ideas I'd like to see</i><br>
<i> &gt; encouraged.  Luckily most of the good ideas come from a few main</i><br>
<i> &gt; sources (some of which aren't me!)</i><br>
 <br>
Indeed.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; So is anyone interesting in setting up an invitation-only list? </i><br>
<p>
Too late. Has already occured.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Choosing new list members would be the job of those already chosen by</i><br>
<i> &gt; whomever wants to organise it.  Maybe a web site could be set up for</i><br>
<i> &gt; viewing (after the list member's controversial ramblings have been</i><br>
<i> &gt; edited for public consumption) or an edited digest version sent out to</i><br>
<i> &gt; the less fortunate non-members.  We could also invite some "big names"</i><br>
<i> &gt; in science, technology, art and (even) politics.  </i><br>
 <br>
Of course.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I would get an invitation for having the idea, of course.</i><br>
<p>
Of course.<br>
<p>
Good bye,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. As my current workload has increased and the majordomo now seems<br>
     to be working I think I will bow out now -- thanks again to all <br>
     low-noise participants.<br>
     <br>
     I would be very thankful is somebody of the transhumantech<br>
     participants would bounce any relevant material to<br>
     transhumantech.<br>
