Hopefully this message won't vanish into limbo the way that everything else<br>
I've sent in the last month or so has done. <br>
<p>
As far as I'm aware, the basic difference between VHS and Betamax is that<br>
VHS stores luminance and chrominance information on the same track, while<br>
Betamax (like professional Beta formats) stores them on seperate tracks.<br>
Consequently Betamax gave a better picture than VHS even though the basic<br>
resolution was roughly the same; this is also why Betacam usually gives <br>
better pictures than Hi8, Super-VHS and DVC even though Betacam's <br>
resolution is lower.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the research I've done, the fundamental problem in the Betamax vs</i><br>
VHS war was almost the same as Apple vs IBM; Sony wanted to screw their<br>
customers for as much money as they could get by being the sole supplier<br>
of Betamax systems, while JVC licensed VHS to anyone who wanted it. As a<br>
result, VHS bloomed and Betamax languished. The small technical benefits<br>
of Betamax over VHS just weren't worth the additional cost and hassle.<br>
<p>
But it's irrelevant to me as my main VCR is Hi8...<br>
