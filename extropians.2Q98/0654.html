At the risk of sounding like a pro-ET freak, I'd like to say that there are<br>
a lot of opinions out there that continue to perpetuate the 'face on mars'<br>
is real and only proves the existence of martian intelligence. How much<br>
have you really researched this topic? or are you taking the photos at face<br>
value??<br>
