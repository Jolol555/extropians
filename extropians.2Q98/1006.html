<p>
Watch yourself here.  Sending a simple black and white photo presupposes:<br>
<p>
1)  That they have electromagnetic vision similar to ours.<br>
<p>
2) That their vision is at the same frequency as our - highly improbable.  Our<br>
'visible' spectrum makes up much less than 1% of the EM range.  Have you seen a<br>
picture of a human face in infrared?  Its very difficult to tell where one<br>
feature ends and another begins.<br>
<p>
3)  That they would have the same spatial awareness to put something into a 2-d<br>
grid.  Why not a tetrahedron or some kind of non-linear grid system?  What is<br>
'simple' to them may be extremely difficult for us because of vastly different<br>
evolutionary histories.<br>
<p>
As a test it would be fun to take an x-ray photograph of a jellyfish and then<br>
digitize it into 0's and 1's and then send this binary coded message to SETI to<br>
see if they can interpret it.  Depending on how clever they are, it could take<br>
them years to figure out what it is.<br>
