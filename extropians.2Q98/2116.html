For all of us who think CTCs and cosmological engineering are<br>
reasonable pursuits :-)<br>

The question of first-cause has troubled philosophers and cosmologists<br>
alike. Now that it is apparent that our universe began in a big bang<br>
explosion, the question of what happened before the big bang<br>
arises. Inflation seems like a very promising answer, but as Borde and<br>
Vilenkin have shown, the inflationary state preceding the big bang<br>
could not have been infinite in duration---it must have had a<br>
beginning also. Where did it come from? Ultimately, the difficult<br>
question seems to be how to make something out of nothing. This paper<br>
explores the idea that this is the wrong question---that that is not<br>
how the Universe got here. Instead, we explore the idea of whether<br>
there is anything in the laws of physics that would prevent the<br>
Universe from creating itself.  Because spacetimes can be curved and<br>
multiply connected, general relativity allows for the possibility of<br>
closed timelike curves (CTCs). Thus, tracing backwards in time through<br>
the original inflationary state we may eventually encounter a region<br>
of CTCs---giving no first-cause. This region of CTCs may well be over<br>
by now (being bounded toward the future by a Cauchy horizon).  We<br>
illustrate that such models---with CTCs---are not necessarily<br>
inconsistent by demonstrating self-consistent vacuums for Misner space<br>
and a multiply connected de Sitter space in which the renormalized<br>
energy-momentum tensor does not diverge as one approaches the Cauchy<br>
horizon and solves Einstein's equations. Some specific scenarios (out<br>
of many possible ones) for this type of model are described. For<br>
example, a metastable vacuum inflates producing an infinite number of<br>
(big-bang-type) bubble universes. In many of these, either by natural<br>
causes or by action of advanced civilizations, a number of bubbles of<br>
metastable vacuum are created at late times by high energy<br>
events. These bubbles will usually collapse and form black holes, but<br>
occasionally one will tunnel to create an expanding metastable vacuum<br>
(a baby universe) on the other side of the black hole's Einstein-Rosen<br>
bridge as proposed by Farhi, Guth, and Guven. One of the expanding<br>
metastable-vacuum baby universes produced in this way simply turns out<br>
to be the original inflating metastable vacuum we began with. We show<br>
that a Universe with CTCs can be stable against vacuum<br>
polarization. And it can be classically stable and self-consistent if<br>
and only if the potentials in this Universe are retarded---which gives<br>
a natural explanation of the arrow of time in our<br>
universe. Interestingly, the laws of physics may allow the Universe to<br>
be its own mother. [S0556-2821(98)00614-6]<br>
