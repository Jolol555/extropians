<i>&gt;  Let's say James Bond and Austin Powers want to correspond about</i><br>
<i>&gt; secret stuff. Obviously, they would exchange keys signed by trusted</i><br>
<i>&gt; parties and go at it. However, what if there are no trusted parties, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; face to face meeting is too risky/expensive? They could each create a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; key-pair not associated with their normal identities and correspond</i><br>
<i>&gt; through two-way anonymous remailers, thus neither knowing whom they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking to but at least knowing it's the same entity each time. If one of</i><br>
<i>&gt; them is captured or subverted, they still won't be able to give away the</i><br>
<i>&gt; identity of the other. Can anyone see any vulnerabilities in this plan</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatsoever?</i><br>
<p>
OK, let's start this conversation.  But we must start it at the beginning.  James <br>
Bond wants to start this conversation, but he doesn't know who with and he <br>
doesn't want to reveal his identity.  So he creates a new secured ID, and sends <br>
a thusly-signed clear message to -- whom?<br>
<p>
(Or maybe he does know who with, but he is aware that this target person will <br>
NOT want James Bond to know who he is dealing with.  How do you send a <br>
message to some specific person, securely, while making it obvious to that<br>
person that you do not know to whom you are sending the message?  You <br>
cannot use his normal email address or his normal public encryption key.)<br>
<p>
One possible solution: he broadcasts it.  An ad appears in the Personals <br>
column (Seeking Same) section of your local Internet newspaper:<br>
  <br>
  "Somewhat destructive secret agent on another continent seeking same<br>
   in North America for exchange of information and target identification.  Reply<br>
   to me@anonymous.remailer with encrypted message using this public key:<br>
   123456789-qwertyuio-asdfghjkl-zxcvbnmp.-."<br>
<p>
And HOW MANY government anti-terrorist groups from around the world <br>
respond?  Each of them claiming to be the sort of person requested in the ad?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Now, supposing they want to bring Maxwell Smart into their</i><br>
<i>&gt; organization. He joins under the same terms as they: anonymity,</i><br>
<i>&gt; encryption, digital signatures on everything. Can anyone spot any</i><br>
<i>&gt; vulnerabilities at this point?</i><br>
<p>
How do they know who joins?<br>
<p>
Here's another approach, in a system of public-key cryptography.  I will <br>
assume that James Bond wishes to communicate with Austin Powers, and <br>
that neither objects to the other knowing the identity of the person they are <br>
communicating with.<br>
<p>
First, double encryption.  Assuming the recipient's key is not compromised, it <br>
is not possible by examining a doubly-encrypted message to determine its <br>
source.  (Examining the envelope on the msg is a different matter; thus an <br>
anonymous remailer.)<br>
<p>
Once the recipient decrypts it using his own private key, he *must* have the <br>
source available to him so that he knows whose public key to use for the <br>
second decryption.<br>
<p>
But assume that at least one person's regular security ID is believed to <br>
possibly be compromised.  Are there any SEMI-trusted parties?<br>
<p>
Let's assume there are 12 parties, each of whom Bond semi-trusts and whom <br>
Powers could safely come in physical contact with.<br>
<p>
Bond sets himself up *two* new security IDs.  ID#1 he splits the public key into <br>
5 parts.  Each part is wrapped in a message "Key part 3 is sdfausdofds".  This <br>
message is then encrypted with Powers' public key.  In front of each of the <br>
results add the text 'Please deliver the following to the next person who comes <br>
to you and says "foursquare bullfrogs".'  Then send each part to two *different* <br>
people on the list of twelve semi-trusted parties, encrypted with their public <br>
keys, through the anonymous remailer.<br>
<p>
Next Bond writes the message: "When Austin Powers comes and asks you <br>
about an email code, tell him 'foursquare bullfrogs'."  He sends this message to <br>
the remaining two semi-trusted parties, encrypted with their public keys, <br>
through the anonymous remailer.<br>
<p>
Now he writes a message to Austin Powers, saying "I've sent you a new public <br>
key via distributed means.  Fred or Joe can tell you the email code that will <br>
persuade the contact persons to give you their portions of the key.  The contact <br>
persons are...  And you have a message you'll need that key to decrypt.".  He <br>
sends this through a remailer to Austin Powers, encrypted with Austin's regular <br>
public key.<br>
<p>
Finally he writes a message saying "This is James Bond.  I need to <br>
communicate with you about..." and giving new contact info, INCLUDING the <br>
public key for his new ID#2.  He encrypts this using his normal private key.  <br>
Adds appropriate text and encrypts it again using the private key from ID#1.  <br>
Adds further appropriate text and encrypts it a third time using Austin Powers' <br>
public key, and sends it through an anonymous remailer.<br>
<p>
To break this by simple spying and wiretapping, you must have compromised <br>
the private keys of no fewer than six people out of a specific group of thirteen, <br>
and you must intercept the parts and connect them together.<br>
