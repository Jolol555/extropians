<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; When expressed in proper notation  the supposed contradictions </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; disappear.  The main argument against fuzzy notation is that </i><br>
Aristotle <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; didn't use it, and therefore anybody who does is a Satanist and going </i><br>
to <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hell.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Er, no.  I do not assert that this thinking is flawed because you're </i><br>
going<br>
<i>&gt;to hell.  </i><br>
<p>
   No offense intended.  I was merely pointing out that logic systems <br>
stand on doctrinal grounds rather than logic.<br>
<p>
That argument itself is inherently problematic.  Instead, I want<br>
<i>&gt;to fall back on my previous argument (I think this was before you </i><br>
walked<br>
<i>&gt;in) that IF an objective reality exists, then acting as if it doesn't </i><br>
or<br>
<i>&gt;presuming false things to be true to any degree will ultimately be bad </i><br>
for<br>
<i>&gt;us; that is, that adhering to falsehood is directly opposed to our own</i><br>
<i>&gt;self interests.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cat in the box is, to some extent, dead and not dead simultaneously</i><br>
<i>&gt;does NOT mean that all things are and are not true; the diffraction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;light on a screen is not ambiguous in any way.  The behavior of photons</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be weird, and may be truly random, but there are certain behaviors</i><br>
<i>&gt;which you will never see and which quantum mechanics predicts can never</i><br>
<i>&gt;happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; It's one of the defining characteristics of bivalent logic, and it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; philosophical child, logical atomism. I do not believe that </i><br>
historical <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; precedence is sufficient reason to declare all other systems of logic </i><br>
to <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; be impossible or immoral.  All that is necesary for a system of logic </i><br>
to <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; be valid is that true conclusions follow from true premises, which </i><br>
fuzzy <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; logic satisifies.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Listen to what you're saying!  "True conclusions from true premises..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not conclusions which are true to some degree from true premises, but </i><br>
TRUE<br>
<i>&gt;conclusions.  Again, I'll buy your logic as an approximation of the </i><br>
real<br>
<i>&gt;truth, but not your fuzzy truth.</i><br>
<p>
As usual, I have fallen into the linguistic trap of using assumptions <br>
which my reader will not have.  I should have said 'conclusions true to <br>
a specified degree follow from premises true to a specified degree.'  I <br>
know this is not the textbook definition of logic, but the textbooks are <br>
based on Aristotle, after all.  I imagine you will not agree with this <br>
definition either, but I am beginning to see a way out of our <br>
definitional difficulties, but I will restrict them to the original <br>
Tarsky post.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; You have caught me.  I am a mystic.  In fact, I am a Jungian </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; psychologist.;)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hah!  Gotcha.  I have a nose for these things.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Depends on which idea you're referring to.  That the brain is a quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer?  This is not unbelievable, a priori, but once you get down to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the evidence, we will ultimately find out if the brain is a quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer.  Science, even QM, always wants to boil down to truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;or falsehood.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I am not trying to support fuzzy truth in this post, merely speculating <br>
on the spread of mysticism.<br>
