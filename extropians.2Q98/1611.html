Damien didn't ask for my input, but I hope he does not mind my adding it....:)<br>
<p>
As a writer, I don't think that imagination has much relation to a 'relaxed'<br>
mindset--<br>
I find a much stronger correlation with mental restlessness and the need to<br>
explore.  I was a 'later born' but from birth had a personality<br>
characterized by a high level of energy and an adventurous nature, and I<br>
think of that as the source of my creativity rather than parenting or birth<br>
order. I could write for the next fifty years and not keep up with all of<br>
the ideas I get every day, because I quickly become bored with stasis and<br>
repetition and want to try new things.  I put on my mental hiking boots and<br>
strike off on some faint path, just for the pleasure of following where it<br>
leads.  Rationality plays a part in it, too.  The scientific studies and<br>
other information I read provide the 'trail mix' that fuels my quest toward<br>
some distant destination.  Sometimes the path leads nowhere, but along the<br>
way I might get to see some neon squirrels and maybe a flying cow or two.  <br>
