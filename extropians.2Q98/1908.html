Well, to be honest, I think this would do us much more harm than good. <br>
Remember, most people consider "small religion" synonymous with "cult." <br>
And if you hadn't noticed, cults don't get particularly good press, nor is<br>
the USG stepping out of its way to protect the cultists' right to worship<br>
in their own special way.  Add to that the fact that many of us consider<br>
ourselves atheists (or militant agnostics!) and we see that, as usual, the<br>
lie does more harm than good. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Must of us are pragmatists and utilitarians, aren't we ?</i><br>
<p>
I am; and for that reason, I want to make it clear to everyone whom I talk<br>
to that it's not a religion; it's a philosophy, and ought to be treated<br>
that way. <br>
