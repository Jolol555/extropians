<i>&gt; Not necessarily, and it's because of the generalization principle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If it is rational for me to be an egoist, then it is also rational</i><br>
<i>&gt; for you to be an egoist.  However, if we were both egoists, we would</i><br>
<i>&gt; both be worse off; this is bad, according to egoism and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; consequentialist value system.  So what we find is that egoism fails</i><br>
<i>&gt; to meet the requirements of generalization according to egoism's own</i><br>
<i>&gt; value system; for this reason, egoism is fundamentally irrational.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's like the Prisoner's Dilemma: egoism demands that we both</i><br>
<i>&gt; incriminate each other; utilitarianism demands that we both keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; silent.  Utilitarianism provides better results, so it is rational,</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to consequentialism.</i><br>
<p>
The prisoner's dilemma only applies to short-term interactions,<br>
not repeated ones.  This is the mistake many non-egoists make with<br>
their naive refutations of egoism: what they reject is not egoism<br>
per se, but _short term_ egoism.  Most "selfish" acts that seem<br>
evil do so not because they are selfish, but because they are not<br>
selfish _in the long run_.  Criminal behavior, for example, may<br>
lead to short-term gains, but in a world where most values are<br>
achieved by interacting with others multiple times, crimials do<br>
far more poorly than rational long-term egoists, who understand<br>
that cooperative behavior is, in the long run, more profitable.<br>
<p>
For extropians, for whom even mortality is a problem to be solved,<br>
should be that much more inclined to think long term, and therefore<br>
value behavior that benefits us throughout our immortal existence<br>
and not just take a buck when we can.  Under these conditions,<br>
egoism is superior to utilitarianism in every respect.<br>
