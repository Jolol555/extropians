The air powered transport would indeed work, but the losses in a pneumatic<br>
system are awesome for tubes large enough to carry passengers and freight.<br>
The air in front of the car is compressed, and the air behind is compressed,<br>
and this causes heating. A pump big enough to pull an active vacuum in front<br>
of the car would be a very impressive piece of machinery. <br>
<p>
There are physical limitations to flow in pipes without huge frictional<br>
losses. I am not an aeronautical or fluids engineer, so I cannot give<br>
precise limits, but i know they exist.<br>
<p>
Heinlein described above ground ballistic transports running in air at<br>
supersonic speeds, with accelerator coils on hilltops at intervals. A neat<br>
idea, but I doubt anyone would let us build one..<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
A maglev - short for magnetic levitation - is using a strong magnetic field<br>
and a superconductor to produce an opposing field (Meissner effect??). The<br>
classroom demonstration is to use a strong rare earth magnet and a<br>
superconducting disk in liquid nitrogen - the magnet will 'float' above the<br>
disk. The only power input is keeping the superconductor cold.<br>
<p>
There are other systems that use two electromagnets and fancy servo systems<br>
to regulate the levitation, but these use lots more power, unless both<br>
magnets are superconducting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, how long would it take fo a craft to get into orbit in a tube? could it</i><br>
<i>&gt;be bursted into orbit like within a few miles?</i><br>
<p>
The only limitation is how many 'g's you want to limit acceleration to. It<br>
should take no more than a couple of miles to get to 18,000 MPH or more at a<br>
one 'g' boost.<br>
