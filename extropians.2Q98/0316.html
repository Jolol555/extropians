But for the right reason. I find both meaningless attachements as well<br>
as HTML in mail highly irritating. Heck, I'll next start sending in<br>
UNICODE solely. (What, you can't read UNICODE? You'd better upgrade,<br>
asap). And attach PDF documents with some fine heraldics. Hey, that's <br>
only 5 MBytes each, why don't you have a T1 in your living room?<br>
Loser. I think we ought to make voice mail attachments mirroring the<br>
post contents mandatory for posts to extropy. The archive server will<br>
love it.<br>

I should really look for that misformed tag that crashes IE/Eudora and<br>
put that into my .sig. Or do a little JavaScript which tries to open<br>
100 browser windows, attempting to hijack them all to heavily Javaed<br>
bestiality sites. What, you don't have 512 MBytes RAM and a quad-CPU? <br>
Loser.<br>

Yeah, we should all just lay back, and mellow up a bit. Orelse it is<br>
just too difficult to have it shoved up your ass.<br>

I have a distance-radar automatics wired to launch a rocket for that<br>
case. Works as a charm, every time.<br>
