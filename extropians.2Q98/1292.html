<p>
Yes, a macroscopic assembler (even a limited one) would likely be very<br>
useful. I'm quite interested in the work done by Klaus Lackner and<br>
Christopher Wendt (see <a href="http://www.discover.com/archive/index.html">http://www.discover.com/archive/index.html</a>) in<br>
how a hive of robots could build a growing solar cell plant. <br>
<p>
Still, the comments about nanoassemblers made by John K Clark are<br>
reasonable; they avoid a lot of the problems inherent in macroscopic<br>
assemblers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would like to see some reviews of the interesting ideas from Joe</i><br>
<i>&gt; Michael at <a href="http://www.stellar.demon.co.uk/index.htm">http://www.stellar.demon.co.uk/index.htm</a> about Fractal Shape</i><br>
<i>&gt; Changing Robots. The basic idea is so simple that i'm wondering how it</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be possible that nobody come with that before. </i><br>
<p>
Actually, Forrest Bishop had a similar idea independently<br>
(<a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb/home.html">http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb/home.html</a>).<br>
<p>
I think Joe Michael has had a good idea, but he is making it a great<br>
injustice. He makes bold claims for it, but provides absolutely no<br>
proof, calculations or even estimates despite claiming that his work<br>
is "academic". I have repeatedly asked him about certain sticky<br>
details (like how to deal with dirt in the connectors, how to program<br>
the system to do useful transformations etc) but not got any<br>
answers. This makes me think he has very little ideas about how to<br>
really implement the robots, but is very eager to proclaim their<br>
greatness.<br>
<p>
It is a far cry from the nanotechnologists, who at least admit their<br>
own shortcomings and do their best to calculate what is possible or<br>
not, and how to get there.<br>
