A few years ago I had an idea for my very own work of art which I have<br>
yet to act on.  Commonly the value of art is directly associated with<br>
its rarity.  So I propose (assuming I'm not too late) a kind of<br>
"Network Art" which increases in value when it increases in ubiquity<br>
(like all good networks).  I propose this as a sort of play on the<br>
popular definition of what makes art "valuable" and a homage to the<br>
network age.<br>
<p>
The problem comes with putting this idea into practise.  It would be<br>
easy to network over the Internet and/or running it on a computer, but<br>
I would rather it retain some ties with "traditional" works of art. <br>
Even then it would have to work on the principle of some sort of value<br>
adding interaction between each artwork, which is hard to implement. <br>
(Although not impossible, and with it's own hardware and wireless<br>
communications this method could work).<br>
<p>
A simpler solution would be some sort of fractal that increases in<br>
complexity with each new print, but I'm not sure that this constitutes<br>
what I'm aiming for.  Perhaps an algorithm to make each new artwork an<br>
amalgamation of its ancestors would be coherent with the idea.  But<br>
I'm still not sure what "increased value" this would bring.<br>
<p>
Possibly the most ambitious idea I've had to date are artworks that<br>
distribute some property from their location to their copies.  Perhaps<br>
the resulting artwork could be an amalgamation of video and/or audio<br>
input from all the places that copies are located.  Or even more<br>
ambitious could be the use of the physical senses, maybe a robotic<br>
statue with "arms" that can be moved.  These could be put in various<br>
locations around the globe but directly linked, so that when a person<br>
in France moves the "arm" in one direction she feels the force of a<br>
person in Australia pushing the "arm" in the opposite direction. <br>
However, I'd really like to make something far cheaper that could take<br>
pride of place in anyone's home.<br>
<p>
Has this sort of thing been tried before?  Does anyone have any other<br>
ideas of how to do this?<br>
