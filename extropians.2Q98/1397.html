<i>&gt; &gt;In a world without patents, 99% of new products would be small</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;incremental improvements to existing products, with next to zero</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;will probably be undertaken by industry consortia who contract</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with each other to share the risk and benefit of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now you have given the world over to the industry consortiums who end up as</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtual monopolies.</i><br>
<p>
Really? How come there is no evidence of these virtual monopolies?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An individual has no hope of being able to bring a</i><br>

Who did Martin Luther King Jr sell out to?<br>
<p>
Why was Robert Heinlein able to dictate to a publisher that they <br>
would sign a certain contract, and then immediately renegotiate it?<br>

<i>&gt; I am not willing to wait for 'evolution' to generate the products I will</i><br>

<i>&gt; leaps and bounds in creation, and benefit from their own efforts. I thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; we were supposed to improve on nature, not slavishly follow it..</i><br>
<p>
This is why a patent system is necessary: so that people CAN make <br>
leaps and bounds in creation.<br>
<p>
Without a patent system, there is very little benefit to the inventor <br>
in even the most obvious evolutionary improvement, let alone in <br>
anything that takes any work.  And such little benefit as there is, <br>
derives from PERSONAL use, not from making that improvement public <br>
knowledge -- so you will probably never learn of it.<br>
<p>
You cannot expect to leap beyond state of the art, if you don't even <br>
know what the state of the art is.<br>
<p>
The patent/copyright system is the reason that the state of the art <br>
is publicized.<br>
