<i>&gt;Science is our greatest method for finding truth, but religion &gt;generates</i><br>
meaning.<br>

<i>&gt;I think you'll find very little true meaning if you worship science alone.</i><br>
<p>
*true* meaning? That's practically an oxymoron.  First of all, meaning is<br>
uniquely constructed by each individual, depending as it does on that<br>
individual's personal history, environmental context, personality, etc.  The<br>
notion that there is such a thing as *true* meaning just doesn't make sense<br>
to me.  Secondly, I don't know what makes you think that religion is the<br>
only vehicle available to us for constructing meaning in our lives. What's<br>
meaningful in our lives is what's relevant and valued.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I recommend Ken Wilber's latest book "The marriage of sense and soul" an</i><br>

When I was an adolescent, I came to the conclusion that science and religion<br>
were simply two different approaches toward learning the same ultimate<br>
truth.  It was later that I learned that religion starts with meaning and<br>
distorts the truth to fit, amending their doctrines only when science<br>
provides irrefutable and undeniable evidence to the contrary. If they want<br>
to continue to do this, fine.  Science will not, hopefully, adjust it's laws<br>
because of religious beliefs that lack evidence.  But this has all been said<br>
before.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll say it again. Science will lead you to Truth, Religion will lead you</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;meaning. Combine the two and you'll be the happiest man alive....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Lots of deluded people are happy.  On the other hand, I can be very happy<br>
without needing religious meaning. You sound completely sold on the idea<br>
that the non-religious lead empty and meaningless lives.  P'shaw.<br>
