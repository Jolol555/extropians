<p>
&lt;&lt; we would simply be extension of God<br>
 rather than independent creatures (and what would be the point in creating us<br>
 if that's so? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
What would be the point in creating us, period?  What need has an omnipotent<br>
being   for a purposely flawed being?  This god person created people with<br>
freewill and also with the ability and capacity for acts of nearly<br>
unimaginable cruelty.  For what possible reason? One experiments when one does<br>
not know what the result will be.  This god is omniscient. He has no need to<br>
experiment, no doubt as to what will happen.  Yet he creates these beings and<br>
sets them spinning anyway?  <br>
<p>
This seems to me a rather depressing idea.  I prefer to believe in myself. In<br>
my own ability, imagination, adaptability.  Rather than sit around wondering<br>
what the "purpose" is to existence, i prefer to live it.  To discover the<br>
answers and the questions for myself.  If the price to be paid for the<br>
supposed comfort offered by a "better life in the hereafter" is the fear and<br>
ignorance demanded by the religionists, i'll pass.   <br>
<p>
Heinlein once had a character remark that "one can bask in the warmth of<br>
religion, or stand in the cold light of reason."  I'll take the cold light.<br>
It may not always comfort, but its dangers can be met and overcome.  And it<br>
beats the daylights out of groveling around on my knees begging for some aloof<br>
being to be nice to me.<br>
<p>
Be well, Cori<br>
