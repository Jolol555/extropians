<i>&gt; In my last post about 'atheists' I did not intend to be read as</i><br>

<i>&gt; I stepped on any toes!</i><br>
<p>
Don't ever apologize for your opinions or your honest observations.<br>
If your opinion steps on some toes, then they deserved to be stepped<br>
on.  I am precisely the militant atheist you described: I believe<br>
strongly that anyone who spends more than 10 seconds even entertaining<br>
the idea of God without dismissing it as groundless speculation is at<br>
best in need of education in reason, at worst dishonest with himself.<br>
