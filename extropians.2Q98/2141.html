"Lipid Accumulation in Obese Zucker rats is Reduced by Inclusion of Raw<br>
Kidney Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in the Diet"<br>
<p>
Abstract:<br>
<p>
    The effects of inclusion of different levels of raw kidney bean<br>
(Phaseolus vulgaris) of high lectin content (27 g/kg meal) in a<br>
high-quality (lactalbumin control diet were tested in nutritional trials on<br>
the growth and metabolism of obese Zucker (fafa) rats and their lean<br>
littermates in comparison with pair-fed controls. All diets contained 100 g<br>
total protein/kg and either 50 g lipids/kg (low fat) or 150 g lipids/kg<br>
(moderate fat). The growth of both obese and lean rats on bean diets was<br>
retarded by the daily bean intake in a dose-dependent manner. However, most<br>
of this was because bean-fed rats contained less body fat than the controls<br>
after 10 d. Thus, after feeding low-fat diets containing up to 130 g kidney<br>
bean/kg (lectin intake &lt;=0.2 g/kg body weight (BW) per d) in both 10 d and<br>
70 d trials, the bodies of obese rats contained less fat but not protein<br>
than their pair-fed controls. Moreover, by increasing the lipid content of<br>
the diet to 150 g/kg, the level of bean inclusion could be increased to 280<br>
g/kg (lectin intake &gt;=0.4 g/kg BW per d) without loss of body protein and<br>
skeletal muscle. Although these rats contained more body fat than those<br>
which were fed on low-fat diets, their weight reduction could be accounted<br>
for exclusively by reduced lipid content. In contrast, significant body<br>
protein loss occurred when the same diet of high lectin content was fed to<br>
lean littermates. Plasma insulin levels were significantly depressed in the<br>
obese Zucker rats on bean diets but the pancreas was not significantly<br>
enlarged nor its insulin content changed in 10 d trials. However,<br>
significant pancreatic growth occurred on long-term (70 d) bean feeding<br>
compared with pair-fed controls. The results suggest that, in addition to<br>
animal nutrition, it may also be possible to use the bean lectin as a<br>
dietary adjunct or therapeutic agent to stimulate gut function and<br>
ameliorate obesity if a safe and effective dose-range can be established<br>
for human subjects.<br>
<p>
Additional quote from text of report:<br>
<p>
    As shown previously, the inclusion of high amounts of kidney bean<br>
phytohaemagglutinin, its main physiologically active lectin component, in<br>
the diet of young actively growing conventional rats at levels of 0.4 g/kg<br>
BW per d or more, adversely affects their growth and metabolism. It causes<br>
a major reduction in their body fat but the accompanying high catabolic<br>
protein loss makes this an unacceptable means of weight reduction. However,<br>
phytohaemagglutinin is not harmful for germ-free rats, therefore the weight<br>
and muscle losses are not direct lectin effects but rather the consequence<br>
of the damage caused by the phytohaemagglutinin-induced E. coli overgrowth<br>
in the small intestine. As this is negligible at daily phytohaemagglutinin<br>
intakes below 0.2 g and particularly below 0.1 g lectin/kg BW,<br>
phytohaemagglutinin is essentially harmless even in conventional rats at<br>
such low intakes.<br>
