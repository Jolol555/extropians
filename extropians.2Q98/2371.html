I am not one for defending Christianity, but my reading of the New<br>
Testament seems to indicate that Jesus kept denying his divinity and kept<br>
telling his followers to stop treating him any differently than any other<br>
human.  I believe that his followers are the ones who diefied him, as with<br>
many great men.  The legend took on a life of its own, and has little<br>
relation to the actual history.<br>
