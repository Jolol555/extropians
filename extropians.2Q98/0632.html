<i>&gt; From:          cryon@mindspring.com (Randy Smith)</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Yes, indeed. In fact, the old saying 'like a fox in a henhouse" would</i><br>
<i>&gt; apply here. If you go into a henhouse after a fox has been in there,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you will find all of the chickens dead and perhaps only one or two</i><br>
<i>&gt; eaten. The fox likes to kill and has it in his genes. I have seen a</i><br>
<i>&gt; panther catch a bunch of sheep in a pasture and break the necks of all</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them and eat only one.</i><br>
<p>
I don't envy you the experience of being close enough to see that <br>
happen.  (What if the panther decides you're an oddly-shaped sheep?)<br>
<p>
Add to the list of things "you don't see in animals" that you see in <br>
animals (not suggesting that they are all as abhorrent as those who <br>
proclaim "you don't see it in animals" wish us to believe -- but some <br>
are):<br>
<p>
   adultery in monogamous species<br>
   homosexuality<br>
   prostitution<br>
   infanticide<br>
   use of intoxicating drugs<br>
<p>
And you can find ALL of those without looking at the species that <br>
might be written off as "too closely related to man".  The first <br>
three, I know for certain are found in birds; the latter two, in <br>
cats.  And most likely in many other species as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People do idealize animals while often denigrating humans in many</i><br>
<i>&gt; ways. Chimps for example, our closest primate cousins. I have seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; videotape of chimps hunt down other monkeys and tear them apart and</i><br>
<i>&gt; eat them.</i><br>
<p>
They even occasionally hunt other chimps.  But usually it's <br>
orangutans, so they mostly evade a charge of cannibalism.  Many <br>
non-primate species of carnivore and omnivore won't hesitate to eat <br>
their own kind.<br>
