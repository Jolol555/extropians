Someone forwarded my earlier comments about Gary North and the Y2K problem<br>
to North, and he took issue with my interpretation of his theology.<br>
Some of the information below comes from an anti-North site,<br>
<a href="http://www.serve.com/thibodep/cr/y2k.htm">http://www.serve.com/thibodep/cr/y2k.htm</a>, some from an anti-Y2K-hype<br>
site, <a href="http://www.erols.com/steve451/doom.htm">http://www.erols.com/steve451/doom.htm</a>, and some from my own<br>
research.  Many of North's books are online at <a href="http://www.freebooks.com/">http://www.freebooks.com/</a><br>
if you want to learn more about his religious views.<br>
<p>
I am not very knowledgeable about the theology of the religious right,<br>
including the Christian Reconstruction movement, of which North is a<br>
founder.  However it is clear that North has been a survivalist since<br>
the 1960s.  From <a href="http://www.serve.com/thibodep/cr/jan.txt">http://www.serve.com/thibodep/cr/jan.txt</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Many newcomers (post-1980) to Christian Reconstruction do not know</i><br>
<i>&gt; the early history of the movement.  For the record, I was an investor</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the rural retreat set up by R. J. Rushdoony in 1965-66.  So were my</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents.  So were dozens of other families.  The property was located</i><br>
<i>&gt; near San Luis Obispo, California.  The investors were people who had</i><br>
<i>&gt; bought gold and silver based on Mr.  Rushdoony's recommendation (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine).  The project collapsed, as communes tend to do, in a nasty</i><br>
<i>&gt; split.  No one ever actually moved there.  It was at the time of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; survival center that he wrote his booklet, Preparation for the Future,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in which he outlined his hard-money, survivalist views.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mr. Rushdoony now lives on the top of a hill in the gold mining</i><br>
<i>&gt; country of California.  Would-be urban survivalists would salivate</i><br>
<i>&gt; over his set-up.  He went there in 1976 to get away from Los Angeles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He asked me to go there, too.  I didn't.  I went to Lynden, Washington</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- still a safe place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      In short, the two founders of Christian Reconstruction preached</i><br>
<i>&gt; survivalism and eventual social collapse even before there was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian Reconstruction paradigm -- before The Institutes of Biblical</i><br>
<i>&gt; Law.  Mr. Lindsey's sweeping statement about what Christian</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reconstruction teaches on personal relocation is uninformed</i><br>
<i>&gt; historically.  He was not present at the creation of this movement,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and he obviously knows little of its early history.  R. J. Rushdoony</i><br>
<i>&gt; got me into survivalism.  He has been far more consistent</i><br>
<i>&gt; geographically in pursuing his vision than I have been.  I have now</i><br>
<i>&gt; escalated my efforts to catch up with him on this point.  I suggest</i><br>
<i>&gt; you do the same.  Soon. </i><br>
<p>
It's hard to say to what extent his survivalism is based on his<br>
theological views versus more secular concerns.  But here is an<br>
excerpt below from the 1980s in which he lays out his fears of<br>
impending doom due to banking and financial problems, all wrapped up<br>
in religious language:<br>

<i>&gt; Earthly Victory</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By Gary North</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The blood of this civilization is presently on the hands of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christians, who have been too timid, and too unsure of themselves, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; propose any alternatives to humanist foreign policy in the name of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ and in terms of the Bible. God set them on the towers as His</i><br>
<i>&gt; representatives to a fallen world, and they have remained silent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They have thought it only natural that humanists should control every</i><br>
<i>&gt; aspect of foreign policy, and that the nation-state should constitute</i><br>
<i>&gt; the heart, mind, and soul of international relations. Now a time of</i><br>
<i>&gt; vast international crisis lies ahead - military, economic, political,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and biological (AIDS).5 The banking policies of the West assure us all</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a coming economic catastrophe. It can be deferred; it cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; avoided.6</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In that day of multiple crises, Christians will not escape unscathed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; any more than righteous Hebrews escaped Assyrian and Babylonian</i><br>
<i>&gt; captivity. When ungodly men are allowed by the righteous to speak as</i><br>
<i>&gt; representatives of a nation (point two of the biblical covenant</i><br>
<i>&gt; model), then that nation will eventually experience judgment. There is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a cause-and-effect relationship in history between covenantal</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards and covenantal judgments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Christians have defaulted on their responsibilities. They have assumed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that covenant-breaking humanists can and should speak for them. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; have not cared to see God's covenant publicly affirmed</i><br>
<i>&gt; nationally. Thus, the 20th century has been the most bloody century</i><br>
<i>&gt; since the Noachic Flood.7 It has become the age of totalitarianism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; bureaucracy, and massive international tyranny, all in the name of</i><br>
<i>&gt; (principle of representation) humanism's false god, the sovereign</i><br>
<i>&gt; autonomous people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The result will be default by the ruling pagans on their</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibilities to the West, the default of Western civil governments</i><br>
<i>&gt; on their economic promises to the voters, the default of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial banks, and the default of private pension plans. The 20th</i><br>
<i>&gt; century has been a century of moral and religious default, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometime during the lifetimes of most of those who read this book in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 1980s, there will be a default by humanist institutions on a scale</i><br>
<i>&gt; unimaginable today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These looming crises offer hope for Christian reconstruction of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanist civilization that is on its deathbed. But if Christians</i><br>
<i>&gt; default once again, refusing to sacrifice their lives and fortunes for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the crown rights of King Jesus in every area of life, then a new dark</i><br>
<i>&gt; age of tyranny is the obvious alternative. There is no neutrality. We</i><br>
<i>&gt; face these choices today: the kingdom of God on earth or the kingdom</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Satan on earth. We face freedom under Christ or the Communist</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentration camp. We face life in the Son or death by nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; annihilation.</i><br>
<p>
This was long before North became involved with the Y2K problem.  He<br>
is predicting doom based on the financial problems of the 1980s, as<br>
did many survivalists in those days.<br>
<p>
One interesting point is that North does not see the impending<br>
destruction as a totally negative thing.  He sees the opportunity for<br>
a "Christian reconstruction" after the disaster.<br>
<p>
Now North has fastened onto the Y2K problem as the latest<br>
justification for his doomsaying.  And even though he thinks it will<br>
lead to a complete collapse of civilization, the end of the world as<br>
we know it, he still thinks it's a good thing:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From <a href="http://www.erols.com/steve451/doom.htm">http://www.erols.com/steve451/doom.htm</a></i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The y2k crisis is systemic. It cannot possibly be fixed. I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will wipe out every national government in the West. Not just modify</i><br>
<i>&gt; them - destroy them. I honestly think the Federal government will go</i><br>
<i>&gt; under. I think the U.S.A.  will break up the way the U.S.S.R. did.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Call me a dreamer. Call me an optimist. That's what I think.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This will decentralize the social order. That is what I have wanted</i><br>
<i>&gt; all of my adult life. In my view, y2k is our deliverance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just don't be in a city when deliverance comes.</i><br>
<p>
Based on this information, I continue to believe that North sees the<br>
Y2K problem in religious terms, as an opportunity to wipe the slate clean<br>
and rebuild a society founded on Christian principles.  If this is true,<br>
it is in his interest to fan the flames of the Y2K crisis, and to work<br>
to bring about the collapse he is predicting.<br>
<p>
Use the links above if you want to learn more about North, both from his<br>
own writings and from his critics.  His site, www.garynorth.com, is a<br>
useful source of information, but use your judgement as to whether it is<br>
presenting a complete or unbiased picture.<br>
