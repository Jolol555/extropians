                  The End of Privacy<br>
<p>
                      Geoff Metcalf<br>
          WorldNetDaily Exclusive Commentary<br>
<p>
                       MONDAY<br>
                    JUNE 22, 1998<br>
<p>
  "The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for<br>
  good men to do nothing." Edmund Burke said. What he<br>
  didn't say was just what a persistent, consistent,<br>
  stubborn s.o.b. evil can be.<br>
<p>
There have been numerous attempts to introduce and mandate a national<br>
identification card system. Freedom lovers have fought time and time again<br>
to impede the progress of the controllers from eroding the Constitution and<br>
Bill of Rights. However, it seems no sooner do we win a skirmish, that our<br>
would-be masters attack again ... and again, and again, and again.<br>
<p>
Like the proverbial bad penny, the national ID beast is back again ... with<br>
a vengeance.<br>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Transportation has published the proposed "Driver's<br>
License/SSN/National Identification Document" guidelines. This draconian<br>
disaster will compel all states to comply within the next two years. The<br>
"Notice of Proposed Rule Making" establishes the "standard feature"<br>
requirements for driver's license cards and other "identification"<br>
documents. Those states which do not comply will discover their citizens<br>
will not be allowed to participate in normal life-essential functions<br>
subsequent to the Oct. 1, 2000 deadline. After the deadline, any licenses<br>
which do not conform, will not be accepted by any federal agency for<br>
identification.<br>
<p>
In the wake of the "Administrative Procedures Act" federal agencies must<br>
announce their intention to execute new rules, and they must provide an<br>
opportunity for the general public to comment.<br>
<p>
Under the provisions of the last assault on privacy, no later than Oct. 1,<br>
2000, ALL state driver's licenses must be linked to the social security<br>
number of the individual (yeah, I know they TOLD us the social security<br>
number was ONLY to be used for tax collecting purposes ... so they lied).<br>
State ID cards must also be linked to social security numbers, and (get<br>
THIS) -- plans are to issue state identification cards to minors! You have a<br>
problem with this? "Show me your papers!"<br>
<p>
Thanks in part to the Dianne Feinstein cabal, each individual must submit<br>
biometric identification which will be compiled in a national database. The<br>
biometric component of choice currently is fingerprints, which is already in<br>
effect in many states like California, but retinal scans and DNA prints are<br>
also being considered.<br>
<p>
Every driver's license or ID card will be required to include a magnetic<br>
strip, imbedded computer chip which will contain the social security number<br>
information. However, a visual display of the private social security number<br>
on the face of the card (for all to see) is apparently preferred.<br>
<p>
All Americans will be required to present this new federally approved ID<br>
whenever you apply for job. Before being hired you will have to be checked<br>
against the national database. Why? Supposedly to determine if you are a<br>
potential terrorist (which could include membership in a patriot<br>
organization, militia, or publisher or writer of any "anti-government"<br>
newsletter, on line service, et al. Big Brother "needs" to identify if you<br>
are a deadbeat dad, tax protester, or illegal alien (I guess so they can<br>
grant you amnesty). You will also need your government approved ID to<br>
travel. In fact, EVERY state must issue the federally approved ID.<br>
<p>
In the wake of current court interpretations and "implied consent" statutes<br>
written into most state driver's license laws, NO probable cause is required<br>
for vehicle stops. In fact, under the new rules, you may be stopped any time<br>
at the whim of the official to check the following:<br>
<p>
* your person ... yes, you may be searched without a warrant.<br>
<p>
* your blood, to search for use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine,<br>
   barbiturates, opiates, psychotropic drugs, or prescription<br>
   drugs.<br>
<p>
* your breath<br>
<p>
* your insurance and registration. Here in California failure<br>
   to prove either may result in seizure and sale of your<br>
   private property by the state.<br>
<p>
* your vehicle and its contents, both of which may be searched<br>
   at any time without warrant.<br>
<p>
Without the new and improved government ID you will not be able to seek<br>
medical care. Medicare and other state services are already linked to the<br>
social security number. This would be extended to all medical care, even if<br>
you pay for it yourself. You will not be able to enroll your children in<br>
school. Eventually all children will have their very own ID card and<br>
national databases will maintain their vaccination records, behavioral<br>
problems, and history of drug use, et cetera.<br>
<p>
If you decide to flee your new draconian control beasts, you'll have a<br>
problem. Passports will only be issued to those who already have the federal<br>
approved ID card. No surprise firearms purchases are affected, Federal<br>
databases will be linked to the national ID, and you won't be able to buy a<br>
gun without the appropriate bits and bytes residing in a federal archive.<br>
<p>
You will not be allowed to work without this new federally mandated mark.<br>
State licensing will be extended to virtually everything, thereby making it<br>
illegal to work without a license, and guess what? You can't get a license<br>
to work without first presenting your federally approved national ID.<br>
Banking? No federal ID, no banking, no check cashing, no loans.<br>
<p>
This is NOT radical right-wing paranoia. Most of the elements of the new<br>
proposed national ID system are already in place NOW. The next step is for<br>
all information to be coordinated and completely accessible to any and all<br>
bureaucrats for their arbitrary and capricious abuse.<br>
<p>
The national ID card itself (which you will be required to carry) will have<br>
a magnetic strip (or chip) which is imbedded in it. That means YOU (when you<br>
have your mandated national ID card on your person) could be tracked<br>
wherever you go. Privacy will be an anachronism.<br>
<p>
Government is supposed to serve we the people. However, as George Washington<br>
observed, "Government is not reason: It is not eloquence, it is Force, like<br>
fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master."<br>
