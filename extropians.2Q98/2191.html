<p>
<p>
For those of you considering applying for the position of NodeMaster for<br>
one of the possible new forums (and for everyone who may subscribe to any<br>
of them), here is how it will work:<br>
<p>
The NodeNet forums each focus on one topic area of interest to Extropians.<br>
<p>
Subscription will be open only to Extropy Institute members (except<br>
sometimes for specially invited experts). <br>
<p>
Most subscribers will be able to read the lists, but not post directly (the<br>
Observers).<br>
<p>
Those unable to post directly will be able to send their questions or<br>
comments to either the NodeMaster or a posting subscriber (Participants).<br>
<p>
The NodeMaster invites experts to participate, and grants or denys the<br>
status of Participant to applicants.<br>
<p>
<p>
The intended result of the NodeNet structure is to create forums intensely<br>
focused on particular topics, while lightly restricting posting ability to<br>
enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, while allowing the filtered input of ideas<br>
from non-postering subscribers, and to do all this without burdening the<br>
NodeMaster with the time-consuming task of moderating every message. <br>
<p>
Applications for NodeMaster positions are best directed towards those<br>
forums in which you have qualifications (what kind of qualifications are<br>
relevant or desirable will vary), and a particular enthusiasm. A general<br>
requirement is an ability to say "sorry, you can be an Observer but not a<br>
Participant)" when this deemed appropriate to maintain high standards of<br>
discussion.<br>
<p>
If you fit the bill, I would be delighted to hear from you. The more<br>
potential NodeMasters we have, the better the NodeNet forum will enhance<br>
the Extropian/Transhumanist community.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
<p>
Max<br>
<p>
P.S. I'm also posting this message to the Transhumans list, since not all<br>
subscribers to that list will see it on Extropians. (If you're on the<br>
Transhuman list, please reply directly as I recented unsubbed.)<br>
