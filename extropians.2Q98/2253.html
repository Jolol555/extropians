I have thought of this idea with nodes for some time. And I find the<br>
idea very bad. Even the idea of splitting up this list in an expert and<br>
a novice list is a bad idea.<br>
<p>
The reasons I have are the following two:<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
- Network economics...<br>
A thing that is worse than a noisy maillist is twenty empty maillists.<br>
As I'm shure everybody on this list is aware of, the value of a network<br>
grows with the number of members squared. A maillist is a network. When<br>
splitting up a maillist into nodes or interrestgroups the value of these<br>
nodes combined will be smaller than the value of one big node.<br>
Naturally the noise level of the big node will probably be bigger than<br>
in the many seperate nodes. Therefore a node will only increase in value<br>
until a certain point. I am pretty shure that the Exi list is so far<br>
from this point that it will be a bad idea to split it up.<br>
<p>
I spend my working time building comunities in intranets and the<br>
Internet. My experience is that a LOT of people has to use something<br>
like a maillist for it to be of any interrest. If not... interrest<br>
simply fades away. This could easily happen for Exi.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
- The succes of the Internet... The ability to reach out.<br>
The main reason for the succes of the net, I think, is that it gives<br>
everybody the ability to reach out and touch anybody they want to. The<br>
Exi list gives us the abillity to discuss with the "leaders" in<br>
transhumanism and extropy, and by participating long enough, to maybe<br>
become one of the leaders ourselves.<br>
If the level of acces becomes to high Exi will loose what I find is the<br>
main oportunity to "recruit" new brains. Even though some of these<br>
brains initially will need som guidance in order keep the noise level<br>
down.<br>
Splitting up the Exi list and closing of some areas works against a<br>
proven good formula. The net itself.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
I do think though that there is a good way to make everybody happy. It<br>
is very easy these days to make a private news server. This way nobody<br>
has to download to much mail, it's easy to kill a boring thread, and you<br>
can just choose not to read messages from people you find are noisy. It<br>
also makes automatic archives. Besides it is pretty easy for somebody<br>
with a little technical savy to combine it with a maillist.<br>
<p>
Well just my $0.02 worth<br>
