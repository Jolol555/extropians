Much of the time, yes.  However, I still maintain that even if egoists<br>
would only hurt people when they could do so and get away with it, the<br>
world would be a much worse place to live if everybody did this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Case :   A person's life is in danger.   Saving that person requires a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt; but controllable risk.     - - Let's say the person is your best friend vs. a</i><br>

<i>&gt; likelihood of jumping in.   If people perceive you to be a selfish and</i><br>
<i>&gt; unsympathetic character, they're less likely to protect you or look out for</i><br>
<i>&gt; you.   People with lot's of enemies or no friends place their lives in grave</i><br>
<i>&gt; danger.</i><br>
<p>
All this shows is that the egoist must be careful.  However, a world full<br>
of careful egoists is not a world I'd like to live in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To take the hedonistic perspective, "Well, only if its fun," assumes that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; value of the pleasure itself is more valuable than your mortality.    To say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Well, I don't have a moral responsibility, but its in my own self interest,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; takes a more practical look at the "economics of self preservation,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; ultimately, what comes around goes around.</i><br>
<p>
Sometimes it comes around, and when it does utilitarianism and egoism<br>
agree.  However, are we prepared to say that it's ok to hurt people so<br>
long as nobody finds out, or if your reputation is not besmirched in the<br>
process?  If I save a few lives in public and rape a few women in secret,<br>
is this the right way to live?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, let's just say, it is foolish to help other people.    - - And, you're a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryonicist.   You probably don't want to expouse this philosophy too much.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why should a cryonics org look out to preserve you after you've gone ???</i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose its no fun and it would be better to pocket the money ?</i><br>
<p>
Better to sign a contract with your clients, mandating that if you decide<br>
to pocket the money instead, big men with pointed sticks will come and<br>
drag you through the Sahara.  In that case, it would be foolish NOT to<br>
fulfill the terms of your contract; this is arguably why contracts exist<br>
in the first place.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Incidently, rationality must be defined according to the ends, not a universal</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth (unless one believes in God).     Likewise, ethics are the means, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be judged in the long terms, by whether they lead to the ends.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
