There's ways around this, too.  Currently we have fraud laws for this sort<br>
of thing.  Under a more anarcho-capitalistic system, an arbitrator could<br>
enforce a contract by which inventors trying to sell a working idea could<br>
be forced to pay the cost of a failed enterprise if the idea failed.  (ie<br>
"If this is snake oil, this here arbitration company will recompense you<br>
what it costs you, at my expense.")<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Before you get paid for developing an idea like we did, you need to find a</i><br>
<i>&gt;market, or develop one. After we do all the hard work, we can then produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;and sell our products, or sell the rights to the patents to others, who then</i><br>
<i>&gt;have the same rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Without the patent, anyone who wants to make knock-off copies of our product</i><br>

<i>&gt;sweat, they gain.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the problem is this:  under a lf-capitalist market, invention has<br>
lots of positive externalities.  After all, you DO gain from the invention,<br>
just as much as your competitor did, but you also had to bear the cost of<br>
invention.  When you give the inventor monopoly status, however, you cut<br>
off those positive externalities and allow the inventor to set prices<br>
arbitrarily high without fear that some pesky competitor will offer the<br>
same product at a lower price.<br>
<p>
So it seems to me that we're choosing between an accidental good and,<br>
apparently, a deliberate bad.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyway, it's darn hard to encrypt a mostly physical device..We don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the replicator, yet..</i><br>
<p>
The encryption is used for the invention, for the sales of the first idea,<br>
not for the product.  The premise that you could have lots of people know a<br>
piece of information and still sell it as if you were the only one is one<br>
of the fallacies which copyright tends to prop up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is to stop anyone who wants to reverse engineer the product and tool up</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make copies? Their overhead is now less by all the time spent in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;original development, so they can sell for less. This would quickly dry up</i><br>
<i>&gt;any investment capital for R+D of anything other than software with strong</i><br>
<i>&gt;encoding. Who wants to risk development time and money if anyone is welcome</i><br>
<i>&gt;to steal it?</i><br>
<p>
You still benefit from the invention in the form of the new market you've<br>
just created or in the increased demand for your products.  The fact that<br>
your competitor will also benefit does not detract from this.  Thus, so<br>
long as you still make a profit from the invention, it's still worthwhile<br>
to pay for it.<br>
