<p>
How can intelligence have any survival value if it can not sense and<br>
interpret it's environment? A super intelligent entity that can't tell its'<br>
been eaten by a mouse is not much good..<br>
<p>
Sentience and intelligence must work together. All animals are sentient, but<br>
there are great differences in intellighence.<br>
<p>
I have a cat sleeping on my monitor as I type. She is definitely sentient,<br>
and intelligent, but I can easily outsmart her in many ways. She exhibits<br>
conciousness of herself and other beings. Abstract thought, though - now<br>
there's a thorny thing to define and test for..<br>
<p>
We need better definitions here..<br>
