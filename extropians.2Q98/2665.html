<i>&gt; You insist that you be free to tread your own path, yet you</i><br>

<i>&gt; evil into the universe.</i><br>
<p>
	To me, you are making a critically mistaken assumption here.<br>
You are assuming that most of the evil is caused by people "treading<br>
their own path".  To me this is completely false.  If some homicidal<br>
maniac is killing people right and left it is clear that something is<br>
wrong.  I have faith that such a person isn't merely "treading his own<br>
path."  To me, these perpetrators of sin and madness are the ones that<br>
suffer the most, at least as much as any would be victims.  These are<br>
the ones towards which God is really, as Cori so eloquently put it,<br>
"one cruel bastard".<br>
<p>
	And most of the suffering death and dieing isn't at the hand<br>
of other humans.  Have you visited a hospital lately and seen all the<br>
miraculous curing from the hideous "acts of God" (i.e. disasters,<br>
disease, aging...) that goes on?  But then, maybe you think stuff like<br>
AIDS isn't an "act of god" but something people just plain deserve<br>
because of their particular chosen "path to tread"?<br>
<p>
	My point is, if there is a God, someone must take the blame<br>
for all the evil.  You seem to want to place the blaim on us and<br>
insist that it is all required if we are to be allowed to "tread our<br>
own path".  I'm sorry, but dying a slow miserable and painful death is<br>
not my chosen path to tread, and I don't know anyone for whom it<br>
really is!  So please show me, God, how I may tread a different, less<br>
sinful path, because this is what I (and I believe everyone) really<br>
want.<br>
