Sorry, but that is an incredibly facile explanation for religious origin<br>
myths.  Two thousand years ago, when people didn't even know what stars<br>
were, there were many smart people who wondered why there was something<br>
instead of nothing, and why the world was the way it was.  In those days,<br>
and even a few hundred years ago, the idea of a creator was a perfectly<br>
rational, metaphysical explanation for the universe.  Unfortunately for<br>
religion, there are now better explanations for why this world exists<br>
(although we are still working on why there is something rather than<br>
nothing).  But dismissing religion as mindless, unjustified belief does a<br>
major disservice to what has been a central intellectual force in this world<br>
up to the beginning of science, a fairly recent phenomenon indeed.  I am an<br>
atheist, but having studied the history of science and religion extensively,<br>
I become irritated when religions are dismissed lightly.  Fundamentalists<br>
are loony-tunes.  But science as we know it today would not have existed<br>
without the Judeo-Christian belief in "rational explanation", which<br>
contrasts greatly with Buddism for example, where the question of origin is<br>
not really considered at all. The first scientists were theologists,<br>
observing the universe around them and trying to explain it.<br>
