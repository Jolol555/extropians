<i>&gt; That's an unsound argument.  Suppose that we find some reason R that</i><br>
<i>&gt; reconciles the existence of God (an omnipotent, omniscient,</i><br>
<i>&gt; autonomous, benevolent being) with the existence of evil.  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no reason that I can see to think that R necessarily entails that 1)</i><br>
<i>&gt; evil will never be overcome or 2) we should not overcome evil.</i><br>
<p>
	No reason?  I sure can't see any reason why you can think this<br>
way.  How would we as sentient beings be any different from God?  If<br>
God doesn't now overcome Evil, how/why should we ever be able to?  Why<br>
could God be different than us?  If God doesn't have to overcome evil,<br>
why should we now try to overcome evil?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Furthermore, if R can provide a case for why a benevolent God allows</i><br>
<i>&gt; evil, then it's possible that R is also applicable to our actions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and thus provides a reason for us to allow evil.</i><br>
<p>
	That's what a theodicy is.  Ann attempt to find any reason R<br>
that justifies evil in the presence of a God.  A theodicy is an<br>
attempt to twist evil or bad into good or into something that is<br>
rationalized or justified.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And if that's the case, then we've merely discovered that to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; right we must allow some evil.</i><br>
<p>
	Such an idea is the ultimate of devilishness to me.  How can<br>
we find some way to twist bad into really being good so we can justify<br>
it's existence or our (or God's) tolerance of it?  Again, I prefer to<br>
hope that such would never be required, that we can find some way to<br>
eliminate ALL evil.  Once we achieve such, as any God must already<br>
have done, how could we be justified in not eliminating it?<br>
<p>
	Good is good and bad is bad in my book.  There can be no<br>
twisting of one into the other.  I seek after and hope for perfect<br>
goodness and make no attempts to justify any evil.  Any belief or<br>
acceptance of any idea or words like "we must allow some evil" is<br>
faithlessly giving up in despair to me.  My hope and desire is to<br>
never give up until all evil is overcome.  It is not consistent to<br>
have such a hope and to believe in a God.<br>
