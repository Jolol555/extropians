<p>
<p>
    IAN: If we say there is "no possible way to construe <br>
    utilitarianism as a 'me first' principle," we say<br>
    the sets of "me first" (M) and utilitarianism (U) <br>
    are disjoint, such that the intersection (^) of <br>
    M and U is the null set(/), ergo: M ^ U = (/).<br>
<p>
    If a libertarian society (L) is a society defined <br>
    by the free market where individuals act according <br>
    to their own measure of what is in their best in-<br>
    terest, there is an intersection of L and M.<br>
<p>
    Therefore, if L = U (as we agree), then there<br>
    IS an intersection of U and M, such that the <br>
    cited claim that M ^ U = (/) would be untrue.<br>
<p>
<p>
    I think that M and L intersect, but not by 100%,<br>
    which is to say, as you've articulated, that not<br>
    all things that can be defined as "me first" can<br>
    be defined as libertarian. I think that L is either<br>
    equal to U or all of L is in U, such that no L is<br>
    external to U (which I think we agree). I believe <br>
    that L may be defined: "me-first + nonaggression."<br>
<p>
    No question this may be open to improvement, and <br>
    does not constitute any deeply imbedded analysis.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Take this thought experiment: You have the opportunity to steal something</i><br>
<i>&gt;you want; you know that you will not be caught.  Your utility will</i><br>
<i>&gt;increase if you steal it, while the owner's utility will decrease more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than yours increases.  An egoist, acting to maximize agent utility, will</i><br>
<i>&gt;steal; a utilitarian, acting to maximize net utility, will not steal.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    IAN: Or a libertarian adhering to the <br>
    nonaggression principle. I think that <br>
    "utilibertarianism" is egoism under<br>
    the principle of nonaggression.<br>
