otter@globalxs.nl wrote 4/11/98: &lt;Btw, suggestions for a better sounding<br>
name are welcome; "Enlightened Rationalism" is too long and sounds too<br>
pompous-a__ed.&gt;<br>
<p>
A recap of the description you gave:<br>
<p>
&lt;What it all boils down to is that any rational person... will use any<br>
means that are available to him to reach his goals. Sometimes his actions<br>
will benefit others, sometimes they will be neutral, and sometimes people<br>
will get hurt.&gt;<br>
<p>
No rationality is used in setting goals, only morality.  Rationality sifts<br>
through various means to various goals in the process of choosing a goal,<br>
but is silent over the actual final choice of a goal.  It is akin to the<br>
difference between effectiveness and efficiency.  Means are always<br>
important because private virtues develop public virtues, which facilitates<br>
the achievement of great aims, while private vices develop public vices,<br>
which facilitates slop.<br>
<p>
&lt;A rational person will recognize that most ethics and morals are nothing<br>
but artificial (extra) burdens on the way to ascension. Life is difficult<br>
enough as it is. Castigating yourself with piontless self-imposed rules and<br>
<p>
regulations is pure S&amp;M.&gt;<br>
<p>
Rational individuals do, in fact, use induction, they do not merely drift<br>
on the waves of infantile desire.  They see that adherence to variations of<br>
morals lead to variations of consequences, some good and some bad.  Some<br>
morals are inductively superior to other morals, if the presupposition is<br>
made that "life is good."  The ability to develop self-discipline is one of<br>
the key capacities that distinguishes homo sapiens from the amoeba.<br>
<p>
&lt;But, unlike many less user friendly philosophies Enlightened Rationalism<br>
(TM)* does not forbid the use of force, including the use of force "just<br>
for fun". It just says "keep an eye on the consequences", which is, wel...<br>
rational. So if you feel like it, and think that you can get away with<br>
it... by all means go ahead!&gt;<br>
<p>
Past adherents of E.R. would include Pol Pot, Attila the Hun, Mao Tse Tung,<br>
Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan, V.I. Lenin...  A "nice" crowd,<br>
all very successful, all very happy with their consequences, very rational.<br>
<p>
&lt;After all, most problems are caused by ridiculous, sanctimonious rules and<br>
standards, and people not being able to live up to them an getting<br>
frustrated because of it. Setting the morals too high only breeds<br>
corruption, lies and blackmail, and sooner or later those who helped to<br>
perpetuate the system will be eaten by it themselves.&gt;<br>
<p>
Obviously, someone has offended you somewhere along the line by expecting a<br>
standard of conduct from you that you couldn't live up to without<br>
sacrificing your adolescent worship of the desire of the moment.  The<br>
record of history shows that corruption, lies and blackmail always result<br>
from a lowering of moral standards, never from an elevating of them.  It is<br>
irrational to ignore the historical record.  Frustration over not being<br>
able to live up to a high standard is adolescent, it is stereotypical of<br>
the spoiled-child syndrome.  It is caused by an abrogation of parental<br>
authority, i.e., decadent children come from corrupt parents.<br>
<p>
&lt;For example, E.R. is neutral on the issues of increasing diversity and<br>
being "life promoting".  These are matters of individual choice and depend<br>
on the situation.&gt;<br>
<p>
If E.R. cannot bring itself to incorporate the metaphysical presupposition<br>
that "life is good" then it is death-worship.  There is no neutrality on<br>
this question, the default is always to entropy.<br>
<p>
In summary, it sounds like E.R. is merely license for a bunch of adolescent<br>
Uzi-toting street-corner Übermensch out for a joy-ride using up the moral<br>
capital stored up in previous generations by the prey around them.  I<br>
suggest, instead of "Enlightened Rationalism", the more honest "Sophomoric<br>
Parasitism".<br>
