Yes, there are many flavours of it: Iterated Prisonner's Dilemma, and<br>
spatial IPD, etc.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; their naive refutations of egoism: what they reject is not egoism</i><br>
<i> &gt; per se, but _short term_ egoism.  Most "selfish" acts that seem</i><br>
<i> &gt; evil do so not because they are selfish, but because they are not</i><br>
<i> &gt; selfish _in the long run_.  Criminal behavior, for example, may</i><br>
<i> &gt; lead to short-term gains, but in a world where most values are</i><br>
<i> &gt; achieved by interacting with others multiple times, criminals do</i><br>
<i> &gt; far more poorly than rational long-term egoists, who understand</i><br>
<i> &gt; that cooperative behavior is, in the long run, more profitable.</i><br>
 <br>
In an iterative, evolutionary scenario the strategy is not static. In an<br>
environment whether you can examine the identity of the other party<br>
and keep a record of your past dealing with that party, and can<br>
share the same information among trusted other parties (nondefecting<br>
in that respect) one should intuitively think more benign strategies<br>
would evolve.<br>
 <br>
In fact this would seem to be validated by observing undenaturated<br>
rural societes. As mobility and anonymity in urban environments have<br>
increased, we need to adjust our strategies to a higher level of<br>
defection (you can't prove one's identity reliably, and there are no<br>
easily accessible records, and you're unlikely to deal with that party <br>
in the future), or make new tools available.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; For extropians, for whom even mortality is a problem to be solved,</i><br>
<i> &gt; should be that much more inclined to think long term, and therefore</i><br>
<i> &gt; value behavior that benefits us throughout our immortal existence</i><br>
<i> &gt; and not just take a buck when we can.  Under these conditions,</i><br>
<i> &gt; egoism is superior to utilitarianism in every respect.</i><br>
<p>
With wearable computing (the Java ring; true wearables) and ubiquitous <br>
networking authentication as obtaining a track record is a piece of<br>
cake. It is much more difficult to make such technologies immune<br>
against misuse.<br>
