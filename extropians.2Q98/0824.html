<i>&gt;There are few, if any, free markets today.  There will be few, if any, by</i><br>
<i>&gt;sunrise tomorrow morning.  This does not demonstrate that there could not</i><br>
<i>&gt;be or should not be a lot more free markets in the future.</i><br>
<p>
Taking a look at the presence of what you call "free markets" now and in the<br>
past however gives us an idea of how likely such a system is. Learn from<br>
history.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;have agreed with me in the past that today's big industry supports</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;government because they get in trouble without them. Do you really think</i><br>
you<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;stand any chance against The Powers That Be [TM]?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Frankly, yes, and I'm not alone.  Yes, BECAUSE I'm not alone.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A little known part of German history is the German revolution from 1918 to<br>
1919. Hundreds of thousands of workers in Germany protested against the<br>
power elite after WW I. They were mainly defeated with propaganda ("Jews<br>
caused the World War"), but some protests were simply shot down. They wanted<br>
a mild form of socialism, nationalization of some big enterprises. The<br>
German foreign minister, Walther Rathenau, was a main initiator of the<br>
treaty of Rapallo, which was made in 1922 and where Germany and the Soviet<br>
Union agreed on economic cooperation and the renunciation of reparation<br>
payments. Rathenau was killed by nationalists on the 24th of June 1922.<br>
<p>
Just one example of a failed revolution. You could also look at the<br>
1968-movement, which was defeated with propaganda -- again.<br>
<p>
And now a few hundred persons want to change the world economic system. And<br>
they think that they will succeed because they are not alone. Sorry, even if<br>
you were a million people, you could not succeed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Obviously, we don't think the world goes to hell when the people can have</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they want.  Why?  Because people don't want their world to go to hell.</i><br>
<p>
Some people want that. Not to hell, but to heaven. It is called the<br>
apocalypse.<br>
Many of these people are in high power positions.<br>
<p>
The other problem is local power. In a decentralized market, you have local<br>
powerlords. Some of them could easily get hold on nukes, biological and<br>
chemical weapons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So instead they take steps to protect themselves from others who would</i><br>
<i>&gt;harm them, and work with others to make their own lives better.  As a</i><br>
<i>&gt;result, the world gets better, not worse, when people can do what they</i><br>
want.<br>
<p>
<p>
Why are there people who harm others?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Partly right, partly wrong.  I'm a soft-determinist: I think that you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;free will if you do not know your own fate.  However, with respect to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;media, CAN I actually make the masses think what I want, given control of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the media?</i><br>
<p>
In Ruanda, it was sufficient to kill about one million Tutsi (CIA<br>
statistics).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that in most places where the government has</i><br>
<i>&gt;taken control of the media, most people don't believe the media, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt;with respect to the government.</i><br>
<p>
What nonsense. People believe whatever they are told. There are really<br>
enough examples for this.<br>
The Vietnam war, the Gulf war, WW I, WW II, the Watergate affair,<br>
*anything*. There's no chance<br>
that Saddam's people would ever revolt against him unless he loses control<br>
of the media.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My immortality is worth nothing if I don't do anything with it.  That's why</i><br>
<i>&gt;none of us wants to become immortal and then do nothing forever.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Personally, I want to become immortal so I can do MORE "deeds" with my</i><br>
<i>&gt;life, achieve more, build more.</i><br>
<p>
And what exactly do you do / achieve?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This bears some merit.  I recognize that this list is for positive</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussion, but would it hurt much to change the policy, adding that people</i><br>
<i>&gt;who want to criticize extropianism should have to add the subject prefix</i><br>
<i>&gt;"ANTI:" to their posts?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'd prefer "BASICS:", but I guess ANTI would be sufficient.<br>
