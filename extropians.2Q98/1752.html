This dawned on me very recently thanks to Michael Lorrey's elucidating<br>
point about subjective truth and contract law.<br>
<p>
These days, it seems like most academia has all but completely accepted<br>
post-structuralist thinking, a philosophy which is completely hostile to<br>
absolute truth. It's impossible to have a society bound by contracts when<br>
a text has infinite meaning.<br>
<p>
Also, note that you find most professors in universities, not <br>
corporations.  They are funded with public money as a public good most of<br>
the time.  So while it is capitalism that has created this public money,<br>
in the eyes of professors, the only reason they don't have more money is<br>
because the greedy capitalists won't give it to them. <br>
<p>
Why authoritarian socialism rather than direct anarcho-socialism?  Most<br>
socialists believe that we can't get straight to anarcho-socialism;  that<br>
society isn't ready to live like that yet.  In order to fix this, they<br>
need to be taught.  They need authoritarian socialism to teach them how to<br>
think, how to work and how to live together without greed.  Once that<br>
happens, you dump authoritarian socialism and live forever in utopia. <br>
<p>
Why don't they see the failings of this system?  Well, many of them DO see<br>
that authoritarian socialism doesn't just "fade away" as Marx put it; this<br>
is the reason why they are now so critical of the former USSR, but still<br>
gung-ho for socialism:  The USSR was doing it wrong, even if it had the<br>
right idea in mind.  Meanwhile, they CANNOT be dissuaded from socialism<br>
while they maintain that reality is fundamentally a subjective<br>
experience, and that a text's meaning is formulated within the mind of the<br>
reader, having no objective meaning, and thus being unenforceable as law. <br>
