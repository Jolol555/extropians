<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Scott Badger:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First of all, the plans for the vehicle were imbedded in the signal we</i><br>
<i>&gt;received from the extraterrestrials, not pi.</i><br>
<p>
It's been a decade since reading Contact, and I didn't recall anything<br>
about Pi. I thought the info was in the ET message.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The message from god was</i><br>
<i>&gt;imbedded in pi. </i><br>
<p>
Well, most gods have lots to say, but little real information in their<br>
messages - seems appropriate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm rusty on this stuff, but what would an algorithm for</i><br>
<i>&gt;running pi out to billions of places have to do with the numbers themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyway?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Some theories of complexity define the amount of information in a string to<br>
be defined as the length of the shortest possible algorithm which can generate<br>
that string. By this definition, the string which represents Pi (which is<br>
infinite)<br>
can be generated by a Pi computation algorithm, which is on the order of a few<br>
thousand bytes. So, Pi has little information and little complexity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Secondly, my apologies for bringing up ancient history (re nanoguitar).  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;saw it in a magazine for the first time that same day.  I did notice your</i><br>
<i>&gt;very next post, however, had something to do with a one-horned goat from</i><br>
<i>&gt;decade ago.  Talk about ancient history.</i><br>
<p>
touche - but el nanoguitar had also appeared on this list about a year ago,<br>
not the goat, though.<br>
