No.  I emphatically do NOT mean that.  I was only being metaphorical.<br>
Johnson actually thinks a lot of insights from hermeneutics can be used<br>
to broaden and extend Objectivism, particularly in the area of ethics.<br>
Sciabarra thinks Objectivism fits into the Russian tradition of dialectical<br>
philosophy, and thereby shares a lot of methodology with Continental<br>
philosophy.  His book is titled, after all, _Ayn Rand: The Russian<br>
Radical_.<br>
<p>
Whether what they believe is true is another story, but their motives,<br>
insofar as I can discern them seem to be not of ideological sabotage<br>
(of either movement).  If they are, they've certainly hoodwinked me --<br>
as I've had extensive contact with both of them.<br>
<p>
Also, not all in the Objectivist movement agree with them.  _The<br>
Intellectual Activist_, put out by Robert Stubblefield, a dude in the<br>
Ayn Rand Insititute camp, ran a very negative review of Sciabarra's<br>
book.  _IOS Journal_ (of the rival Institute for Objectivist Studies)<br>
also ran a scathing review of the same work.  Most Objectivists,<br>
from my experience, have ignored or disagree with Sciabarra's<br>
work.  (Johnson is less well known, perhaps because he hasn't<br>
made a splash by writing a major book on the subject.)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Personally, I don't believe _all_ poststructuralist, postmodernists and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hermeneutics is bunk, though like all movements, the members of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; these probably do too far and lack perspective.  It's like the New</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Critics who saw irony in everything or Freudians who see sex all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; over the place.  I'm sure there's a good deal to be learned from all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can learn as much from someone by studying their lies as much as </i><br>
<i>&gt;when they tell the truth. For example, there is a whole branch of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;NSA which studies nothing but disinformation. By studying what a </i><br>
<i>&gt;government is saying that is truthful and what is lies, you can discern </i><br>
<i>&gt;much about what they wish to hide, deny, or otherwise obfuscate</i><br>
<p>
As long as one is able to verify their truth and their lies outside of what<br>
they say.  My point, however, was that poststructuralist, postmodernists<br>
and hermeneutics is equivalent to lying.  At least, not all of it is lying.<br>
Surely, some of it -- like any philosophy -- is off the mark.<br>
<p>
The thing to do is to look dispassionately at the methods and ideas.<br>
For example, it seems that Sciabarra is onto something when he says<br>
Objectivism is dialectical in method -- even if Objectivists don't know<br>
it.  It might disagree with other dialectical philosophies, such as<br>
Hegelianism and Marxism, but this doesn't change his point.  Both<br>
Newtonian and Einsteinian physics lead to different conclusions<br>
despite having similar methods.<br>
