<i>        &gt;Half the world's population believes in some form of redemptive         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;qualities in suffering.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I quote from Reilly Jones, "Fortunately, majorities don't manufacture truth".  <br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Suffering or pleasure are very weak guides to morality.</i><br>
 <br>
<p>
If true then can you give me a reason, any reason at all, why morality is  <br>
better than immorality?  And what does "better" mean anyway?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why would suffering or pleasure matter much at all </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Perhaps leaving my hand in a fire or pulling it out doesn't matter much at <br>
all, I don't know and I don't care, I'm still pulling my hand out and if  <br>
morality doesn't like it morality can lump it. <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>           &gt;especially since such physiological reactions are increasingly        </i><br>
<i>           &gt;modulated by technological means?</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
All physiological reactions without exception can be modulated by <br>
technological means. What does that have to do with the price of eggs?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They just don't mean much in the moral sphere </i><br>
<p>
<p>
In my mind you just torpedoed any attempt to take the moral high ground in <br>
the abortion debate, you were never anywhere near it in the euthanasia debate. <br>
If your ideas about morality are correct then I'm immoral and proud of it and <br>
your insults are badges of honor.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I could care less about happiness</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Your philosophy is cutting edge, cutting edge for the 13'th century that is, <br>
the same is true of your science.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Happiness isn't everything, in fact, it's not much at all.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Gee, you make your philosophy sound so appealing I don't see how anyone could <br>
resist it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Is the statement "all things are relative" a true statement?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No. The speed of light is absolute, it's the same for any observer.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Relativism is incoherent.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And you've also rejected Quantum Mechanics, I think that's part of your  <br>
credibility problem.  After dumping on the two greatest intellectual <br>
accomplishments of the century it's hard to get people to sit contentedly at <br>
your feet while you scream insults cry about modern times and preach morality <br>
to them, the promise to make them stupid and unhappy may not be enough of an<br>
attraction.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the society I live in and am trying to raise my children in, is       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;so much more degraded than the one I grew up in that it shocks me.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Pissing on a spark plug shocks me.<br>
                     <br>
