&lt;&lt; The air powered transport would indeed work, but the losses in a pneumatic<br>
 system are awesome for tubes large enough to carry passengers and freight.<br>
 The air in front of the car is compressed, and the air behind is compressed,<br>
 and this causes heating. A pump big enough to pull an active vacuum in front<br>
 of the car would be a very impressive piece of machinery. <br>
 <br>
 There are physical limitations to flow in pipes without huge frictional<br>
 losses. I am not an aeronautical or fluids engineer, so I cannot give<br>
 precise limits, but i know they exist.<br>
 <br>
 Heinlein described above ground ballistic transports running in air at<br>
 supersonic speeds, with accelerator coils on hilltops at intervals. A neat<br>
 idea, but I doubt anyone would let us build one..<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The tubes could have gills in them, like in front of the craft the gills are<br>
open, so it wont create compressed air in front of it (or not as much), since<br>
it will escape into the outside air, and as the craft passes over the gills<br>
they become temporarily sealed to hold the seal-tight air bursts behind the<br>
craft, then they would have to be opened again for the next craft after the<br>
first craft passes the next charging station.<br>
The gills would have to be like super thin and lightweight (but still able to<br>
be sealed), so it wont create very much friction for the craft.  Where and<br>
when to get out have to be worked out, like perhaps the tubes split, and they<br>
are diverted in a station, so it wont hold up the crafts behind it as they<br>
pass through.<br>
