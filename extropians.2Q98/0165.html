    This is the 20'th update on my fly longevity experiments. I made two<br>
 mistakes with this run, one minor and one major. The minor one is that I<br>
 apparently forgot to include the non-toxic taurine larvicide in the onion<br>
 4X/chitosan 4X, and onion 4X/paprika combination bottles. The breeding<br>
 that occurred in these bottles, rendered any census impossible, and so<br>
 these bottles had to be discarded.<br>
    The major mistake was adding still boiling water (instead of boilED)<br>
 to all of the supplement bottles, without first testing to see if this<br>
 was beneficial. Fortunately I included a normal control using cool water,<br>
 in addition to a hot control using boiling water, for all of the three<br>
 breeding bottle fly sources. Thus I am able to learn from my mistake.<br>
    Using boiling water reduced fly longevity by two mechanisms. One was<br>
 purely physical. This involved the formation of tight cracks between the<br>
 fly food and the inside of the bottles. In some supplement bottles these<br>
 were narrow enough to trap and drown numerous flies in the moist fly<br>
 food. The onion 4X bottle was a great example of this, with all of its<br>
 flies being drowned by the day 34 census. Fortunately these cracks tended<br>
 to widen with time as the fly food slowly dried out, so that after the<br>
 day 34 census, few flies met their end in this way.<br>
    The other mechanism reducing longevity can be only speculated about.<br>
 After all the flies in the three hot control bottles had died, a few<br>
 still lived on in the corresponding cool water control bottles. This<br>
 appears to constitute a genuine aging acceleration phenomina. I presume<br>
 this is due to the boiling water destroying some of the vitamins in the<br>
 fly food and inducing subclinical nutrient deficiencies, which manifest<br>
 themselves late in life.<br>
    On a positive note two observations stand out in this run. First<br>
 hawthorn appears to increase life span. Secondly the factors responsible<br>
 for the longer life span associated with cinnamon or sage<br>
 supplementation, appear to be lipid soluable, since addition of the fat<br>
 binding fiber chitosan eliminates this effect.<br>
    I am trying something different for my eighth run. All flies used here<br>
 have been "pre-aged" in holding bottles containing taurine larvicide for<br>
 29 days prior to use. About 75% of the flies in these bottles had already<br>
 died before the eighth run had even been begun. I had anticipated some<br>
 mortality, and so had used 5 holding bottles. However even with the<br>
 increased number of fly sources, I found that I did not have enough flies<br>
 to commence a full sized run. I did the best I could here, with the flies<br>
 available. Since these aged flies were virtually unable to fly I upended<br>
 each holding bottle, and dumped the flies into one bottle prior to use.<br>
 The advantage here is that the flies from all five holding bottles are<br>
 homogenized so that five control bottles are not needed to account for<br>
 variations in average fly age from different bottles.<br>
     The main advantage of using pre-aged flies is that the eighth run<br>
 will be completed quick enough, that I doubt that rotting of the fly food<br>
 would be much of a factor limiting life spans. It is possible that larger<br>
 differences in longevity might manifest themselves with this change in<br>
 procedures.<br>
     I would like to thank Robert Ettinger and Andy Zawacki for donating<br>
 the acetyl-carnosine for the eighth run. I am told that this is from<br>
 Russian sources.<br>

                 with 20 mg Carolina Biological 4-24 fly food<br>
<p>
  Note: 1 gm taurine added to all bottles to eliminate breeding<br>
  Glass milk bottles are used to contain flies.<br>
  Entire experiment is located on a card table near a window.<br>
  Fly life spans tend to be longer in runs during the winter,<br>
  due to the lower temperatures.<br>
<p>
  Also note: (to my knowledge)<br>
  Every major university in North America has a fly lab.<br>
  None are currently doing fly longevity experiments.<br>
