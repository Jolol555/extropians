<i>&gt; &gt; As Mr. den Otter has previously said is such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rude manner, I am rather extreme myself, although</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I personally take pride in that, since being</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; average is to me as good as being dead.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I hope here I have accurately described conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for most people...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's strange, I see free market capitalists as "get back to basics"</i><br>
<i>&gt; people.  When compared to our natural systems, anarcho-capitalism is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the most conservative of all.  It actively promotes the individual,</i><br>
<i>&gt; competition, survival, and all the other aspects of Darwinism.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; promotes the active expectance, and even advocacy, of genetically</i><br>
<i>&gt; pre-programmed drives. Perhaps many socialist systems should be best</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered as "reactionary" responses to this, but I consider the</i><br>
<i>&gt; general idea of "transcending" our genetic heritage to be sound</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanist thought.  I certainly see no reason to consider this</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrational.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And although anarcho-capitalism may make a nice "means" it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly not the "end" - don't forget that we're transcending here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That is transcending forwards to something new, not backwards to</i><br>
<i>&gt; something been and gone.  And while I too can be accused of</i><br>
<i>&gt; questioning the rationality of morals and non-competitive behaviour</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is something behind them.  Collective intelligence and ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; to communicate emotional experience is leading to a greater move</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards moral complexity.  Is this good or bad?  It's certainly bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; for your system, but what about those darn socialists?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I see free market capitalism as an ideal of efficiency and<br>
individuality that a socialist system can never compete with either in<br>
terms of economic growth or in pbulic morale (in the long run,  however<br>
people are always happy after they elect the next bumch of crooks into<br>
office that guarranteed them bread and circuses).<br>

Actually, its because we don't have a big black market mafioso and<br>
government approved mafioso simultaneously robbing hard wroking people of<br>
their hard earned dollars. While our per capital income is low, our cost<br>
of living is also low due to our low government and criminal overhead.<br>
