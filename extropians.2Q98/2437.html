It shouldn't have taken you a full page to disprove A = -A.  Consider: A +<br>
-A is zero, or should be.  But if A = -A, then A + -A = A + A = 0.  You<br>
could do this for any number, including a constant; all numbers would<br>
equal zero, including such important numbers as pi and e and 1 and<br>
infinity, and the probability that anything exists at a given point.  In<br>
other words, you get a nonsense universe. <br>
<p>
However, you have misunderstood Ian's holism.  (He is often a little,<br>
shall we say, synedochical?)  A is not equal to not-A, but rather he makes<br>
the point that you really have no idea what A is unless you define it in<br>
terms of something that it isn't.  To evince: if you came up to me and<br>
asked me what A is, and I told you "A is A," while I would have said<br>
something true, it would have been completely useless to you.  On some<br>
level, you really wanted to know something about what A is in relation to<br>
something else; in other words, what A is not.<br>
<p>
The bit about A = -A comes from the net identity charts.  Basically, it<br>
goes like this: take a universe consisting of only two things: A and B,<br>
remembering that A is only defined in terms of its relationship to other<br>
parts of the universe.  Clearly, A is zero difference from itself, and it<br>
has (let's say) a difference of 1 from B.  (Units are deliberately left<br>
out of this analysis: it doesn't matter what property you're referring<br>
to.)  Well, B has a zero difference from itself, and the difference from B<br>
to A is -1.  Ian points out that if you sum all of these relations, you<br>
always get zero.  He calls this the "net identity."  It is always zero.<br>
<p>
Here's where you make the dubious leap: if A is defined not by itself, but<br>
by its relations to things which are not-A (in this case, B) then on some<br>
level you could say that the identity of A is its net identity, which is<br>
always zero.  Repeat this for B, or -A, and you see that the net identity<br>
of A is equal to the net identity of -A.  A + -A = B + -B = 0.<br>
<p>
This is really a trivial point, and doesn't really tell you anything about<br>
anything that a properly defined atomism wouldn't.  It is also not holism<br>
in the way you'd probably define it (but which Ian would): note that for a<br>
mysticist, because A = -A, (rather than the net identity of A = the net<br>
identity of -A,) the sum of the net identity is 0, 1, 8, infinity, and all<br>
other numbers simultaneously, because all numbers are equal to all other<br>
numbers.  Ian agrees that this is illogical, however: his identity charts<br>
always sum to zero, and only zero.  He WOULD argue that the net identity<br>
of all numbers is equal to the net identity of 0, but as you can see, this<br>
is a much weaker (and far more defensible!)  claim.<br>
<p>
I asserted that atomism = holism (IAN's holism, I mean!) because his<br>
holism is saying much less than most holists.  Meanwhile, he has held a<br>
definition of atomism which basically states that things are defined in<br>
terms of themselves; this is completely nonsensical, as you should be able<br>
to see, because you have to have a frame of reference in order to define<br>
anything.  You can't say that A = A and then go on to say that you now<br>
know what A is.  Telling you A in relation to 0, however, may be more<br>
useful, particularly if I give you a few other values in relation to zero.<br>
This is what the atomists are really talking about: you won't find any<br>
Newtonian physicist claiming that particles have a velocity independent of<br>
their refrence frame, but they are atomists nonetheless, because they<br>
believe that particles may have independent properties *within a single<br>
reference frame*, ie in relation to zero.<br>
<p>
To summarize: it's not that A=-A, it's that identity(A) = identity(-A) =<br>
0.  Whether you agree with this definition or not is your own lookout.<br>
