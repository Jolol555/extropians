I though I'd pass this on the the extropians, more pseudoscience is NOT<br>
what the public needs to read.<br>

Please read this entire message if you care about science.<br>
<p>
Yesterday, I went to a Barnes and Noble bookstore and found a new<br>
"science" magazine (Volume 1, Number 2)  next too Popular Science and <br>
Scientific American. This magazine is called Cosmic Pursuits. At first,<br>
I was happy to see a new magazine which claimed, on the cover, to be in<br>
pursuit "of Answers to Life's Big Questions "<br>
<p>
Inside (page 4), it even told what the mission of this magazine is:<br>
<p>
"Cosmic Pursuit is the quarterly journal of The Day Star Network. Its<br>
purpose is to encourage thoughtful discussion of life's ultimate<br>
questions, to inform readers of relevant scientific discoveries, and to<br>
provide a platform for dialog and debate between a variety of<br>
viewpoints.<br>
<p>
The Day Star Network is a division of the Day Star Productions, a<br>
non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Wheeling, Illinois. Its<br>
mission is to encourage people to seek answers to life's big<br>
questions--and to provide the best information possible to aid in that<br>
quest. The Day Star Network is an informal network of interested<br>
individuals of all beliefs and educational backgrounds, organized by Day<br>
Star Productions."<br>
<p>
This sounded great, but as I read the essays, I realized this was not<br>
what it claimed to be!!!!  The articles in this magazine were not<br>
scientific at all! This turned out to be a creationist rag dressed up<br>
with slick, shinny pictures and articles on pseudoscience like<br>
"Intelligent Design" and why AI is doomed to fail<br>
<p>
On the back of the magazine, it gave a web address<br>
<a href="http://www.daystarcom.org">http://www.daystarcom.org</a><br>
<p>
If one explores the site, you find the creationism bias everywhere!<br>
<p>
In fact, a different version of the text above appears at <br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.daystarcom.org/info/daystar.htm">http://www.daystarcom.org/info/daystar.htm</a><br>
<p>
" Day Star Productions is a non-partisan, non-denominational,<br>
not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization. Founded in 1978, its mission is<br>
to encourage people to seek a close relationship with the<br>
Creator/Sustainer of the universe. The Day Star Network is an informal<br>
network of  interested individuals of all educational backgrounds and<br>
beliefs, organized by Day Star Productions.<br>
<p>
Why did they not print this in the magazine? If they were honest about<br>
their bias and intentions, it could not be sold in large bookstores like<br>
Barnes and Noble as if it were an actual scientific journal.<br>
<p>
This is also from <a href="http://www.daystarcom.org/info/daystar.htm">http://www.daystarcom.org/info/daystar.htm</a><br>
<p>
"The Day Star Network<br>
<p>
Purposes: <br>
<p>
1.To examine the relevant evidence from modern science and the best<br>
arguments from philosophy and history that bear upon life's big<br>
questions, such as: Does God exist? If so, what kind of a God is he/it?<br>
Is the universe an accident, and are we conscious beings an accident<br>
within a larger accident—or is there some grand purpose behind it all?<br>
Can a non-theist create his own meaning and his own ethical system? <br>
<p>
2.To help make the latest discoveries in science understandable and<br>
relevant to the general public. <br>
<p>
3.To encourage people caught in a rat-race world to do something<br>
uniquely human: to stop and think about life's big questions, and to<br>
critically examine all viewpoints. <br>
<p>
4.To provide a forum for debate between knowledgeable representatives of<br>
opposing viewpoints on these questions.<br>
<p>
5.To promote mutual respect and understanding between people with<br>
opposing life-views.<br>
<p>
To carry out these objectives, the organization: <br>
<p>
Publishes Cosmic Pursuit, a quarterly journal to encourage thoughtful<br>
discussion of life's ultimate questions, to inform readers of relevant<br>
scientific discoveries, and to provide a platform for debate between<br>
opposing viewpoints. Provides people with an opportunity for networking<br>
with others who are interested in examining the latest scientific<br>
evidence and logical arguments that bear on these cosmic questions. <br>
Promotes written works, videos, and other resources that  encourage<br>
knowledgeable discussion of life's big questions.<br>
<p>
Carries out research projects in order to contribute to the body of<br>
knowledge bearing on these questions. <br>
<p>
Organizes seminars, conferences, and debates.<br>
