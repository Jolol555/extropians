This is a nice idea. If it can be made to work for products such as my<br>
company produces, I will gleefully vote to eliminate copyright and<br>
trademarks.. I would make my killing on the first sale, and then could spend<br>
my time creating new ideas rather than marketing the old!<br>
<p>
As far as the IP anti-replication schemes go, unless the contracts<br>
prohibited reverse engineering, I see a huge underground economy in sales of<br>
these with the 'fingerprints' stripped out. A compiler that is hacked to not<br>
look at them is another possibility.<br>
<p>
I personally like the idea of the finished product automatically registering<br>
itself with the creators. There is also the process where a compiler would<br>
register each IP component as it was included in the end product. This is a<br>
case where strong public key encryption will shine, if the compile must<br>
handshake with the property owner's system everytime a product is compiled..<br>
<p>
How about only selling the 'source code' for a product, encrypted, of<br>
course, and letting each customer compile the end product himself? The self<br>
registration system would then directly pay the component owners every time<br>
a product was built...<br>
