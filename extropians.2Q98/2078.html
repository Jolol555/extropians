I notice that you did not respond to the rest of my post.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How does it fail to meet this criteria?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Simple:  when you choose not to extend your life, you choose to die.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are dead, you are unable to pursue your own interests (barring</i><br>
<i>&gt; afterlife presumptions).  Therefore, when you choose to die, you choose to</i><br>
<i>&gt; contradict the rest of your value system, if your life has any use at all</i><br>
<i>&gt; in bringing about that which you value.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since I doubt that Hayflick would like it if I offered to kill him, we may</i><br>
<i>&gt; presume that he values his own life or that his life is extrinsically</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful in bringing about that which he DOES value.  Whichever it is, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; immortality is possible then he necessarily contradicts his own value</i><br>
<i>&gt; system by refusing it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This may not be true if for some reason his life ceased to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; extrinsically useful in bringing about what he valued.  However, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably false to presume that it never could given lots of time.  So even</i><br>
<i>&gt; this case is not sufficiently strong to endorse suicide.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with your entire post, excepting part of the first paragraph. The <br>
post is not really related to my original comment, though. Recall that the <br>
comment I made was a caveat, which I do not seriously expect to apply in <br>
many instances. For example, it was not intended to apply to Hayflick. I <br>
was merely pointing out that it is possible to hold a consisitent <br>
philosophy which leads one to conclude that immortality is a bad thing.<br>
<p>
As a counter-example to your first paragraph, I offer euthanasia, which I <br>
believe is sometimes justified. This is not a counter-example to your <br>
conclusions, incidentally, but to your assumptions: this is a situation <br>
in which your life may have no use to you in bringing about the things <br>
you value.<br>
