	"I certainly don't know whether Carol and I had the ideal amount of<br>
overlap, but I would say we approximated it fairly well...  The `I', the<br>
very core, of each person has been incorporated into the other person.  Not<br>
only lovers, they are now psychologically merged, blurred, blended, and<br>
fused, and have come to form one composite entity.  This is perhaps why, a<br>
few months after Carol had died and I was gazing up at her photo... I felt<br>
myself falling deeply into and through her eyes right into her innermost<br>
core, and behind a veil of tears I heard myself sobbing, `That's me, that's<br>
me.'"<br>
		Douglas R. Hofstadter, Le Ton beau de Marot (1998)<br>
<p>
<p>
Death is intensely personal.  Its theft of another human world hurts us<br>
deeply, if we have shared even in some small measure that internalised<br>
overlap of which Douglas Hofstadter writes so poignantly.  We are moved by<br>
death more greatly, perhaps, than by any other passage - except, perhaps,<br>
by birth.  Does thinking about death in the somewhat remote and clinical<br>
mode of science distract us from that fundamental agony of loss whose only<br>
appropriate answering voice is music and the hard melodies of poetry?  I<br>
have no wish to evade mortality's personal dimension by speaking of nothing<br>
but superoxide dismutases, the mysteries of the quantum, or the resplendent<br>
glories of the cosmos.<br>
<p>
Still, death in aggregate does not move us quite so fiercely, death on the<br>
large scale of those wars and starving throngs we see behind the television<br>
screen each night, death as the reaper of millions we do not know and might<br>
not like very much if we did know them.  Our kindest emotions sag beneath<br>
`compassion fatigue'.  And for the young, and honest, death and its mimicry<br>
can also provide the fiercest of thrills.  Healthy young gangs of men<br>
travel great distances to maim each other in soccer game riots, just for<br>
the pleasure of it.  Vivid computer simulations allow most boys and young<br>
men in today's technologically advanced nations, and a few girls, to<br>
obliterate imaginary foes in gory detail - even to flash whole cities into<br>
nuclear fire.  We embrace what terrifies us most.  Or we ignore and<br>
suppress it.  But death will not go away - unless we make it go away.<br>
<p>
For the first time since single-cell life coalesced on this planet, we are<br>
perhaps within reach of doing just that.<br>
<p>
So the keen pathos of mortality remains our spur, but we are justified in<br>
regarding death, for a time, as an abstract force to be countered with<br>
knowledge and determination, rather than appeased by mythic verse and<br>
surrender.  But solving death, and life, is not a merely technical project.<br>
 It embraces everything that makes us human.  The first immortal generation<br>
will not be the children of just science alone, but of law, art, music,<br>
writing - all the humane arts.<br>
<p>
Although the Genome Project will accelerate the knowledge base for direct<br>
genetic intervention, there is very much more in an organism (especially a<br>
person, as Hofstadter makes us remember, eyes prickling) than is to be<br>
found even in a total DNA map.  The ethical consequences of the new<br>
sciences are formidable, even before the acceleration of science and<br>
technology turns into an headlong ascent and death is put to rout (if that<br>
ever happens).  We need to be prepared well and truly in advance.  We need<br>
to learn how to think clearly about both death and life.<br>
