<p>
Go back and reread my argument again, this time note that all observers and<br>
the light particle are travelling though the same medium, having uniform<br>
density, which for convenience I'll call "vacuum."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Halliday &amp; Resnick are fine by me, mine's sitting at arm's length.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe I misunderstand your argument in that case...  Halliday and Resnick<br>
have a chapter on relativity, which I thought you disagree with.  Have I<br>
grossly misunderstood you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;...it has also been observed that muons, which have an average lifetime of</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.200 microseconds, have an average lifetime of 63.5 microseconds when</i><br>
<i>&gt;moving at 0.9994c relating to the laboratory; precisely the value predicted</i><br>
<i>&gt;by special relativity.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And in regions of the universe where the Planck moment is approximately the</i><br>
<i>&gt;constant it is in our region, when the muon achieves light speed, it lasts</i><br>
<i>&gt;an eternity while spreading itself atemporally through every possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;accessible place á la Russell's/Feynman's sum-over-the-histories.</i><br>
<p>
So what are we disagreeing about?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Usefulness is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge, it is substantially lower down the scale.</i><br>
<p>
True.  So when you provide me with a new cohesive model backed up by<br>
experimental evidence, I'll use your model.  But without that experimental<br>
evidence, how do you purport to know which model, if either, is wrong?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I read about plenty of confusing and contradictory interpretations.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;dogma isn't overthrown yet, something more fashionable hasn't arrived, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;hopefully it will arrive, or if it doesn't, at least its adherents will not</i><br>
<i>&gt;treat it as science.</i><br>
<p>
This is interesting.  What have you been reading?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[Black holes "melting"]  Black holes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;recyclable at a high enough technological level.</i><br>
<p>
I've never heard of this.  References?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;An intelligible universe cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;contain ontological randomness, but it can contain bucketloads of</i><br>
<i>&gt;epistemological randomness.</i><br>
<p>
I concede that any observable randomness is at least just that; random as<br>
far as we can observe...  but what is so unintelligible about randomness?<br>
<p>
For that matter, what exactly do you mean when you say "intelligible?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;DF: &lt;Information is a signal which reduces uncertainty.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Reduces uncertainty for whom?</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  Go read any book on information theory, and get back to me.<br>
<p>
Oh, by the way, you glossed over my pop quiz:  What's in a book that hasn't<br>
been read?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;DF: &lt;Most, if not all people who support abortion do NOT think that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fetus can be killed.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Aside from the sheer erroneous nature of this claim, I would say, "how</i><br>
<i>&gt;convenient."  I could just as easily claim, and with as much logic, that</i><br>
<i>&gt;most people who support slavery do NOT think that slaves have full status</i><br>
<i>&gt;with humans and can therefore be owned as property, like cattle or land, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be dispensed with arbitrarily.  Slavery and abortion are definitional</i><br>
<i>&gt;issues, the same issue, in fact, the definition of human.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is another form of the might makes right barbarian tyranny.</i><br>
<p>
You misunderstand me.  I'm not arguing that you are wrong...  I'm making<br>
the much safer claim that you do not have a logical argument for abortion,<br>
BECAUSE we do not agree on definitions and premises.<br>
<p>
So, in syllogistic form:<br>
<p>
(1)  Axiom:  That in order to have a logical argument, all parties must<br>
agree on the premises and definitions relevant to that argument.<br>
(2)  We do not agree on the definition of human.  (Empirical.)<br>
(3)  Therefore, we cannot have a logical argument about whether abortion is<br>
the murder of humans.<br>
<p>
P if and only if Q.<br>
Not Q.<br>
Therefore not P.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;recall, the American Civil War was fought largely over defining what a</i><br>
<i>&gt;human was.  No logical discussion between the North and the South was</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible because they did not agree on common definitions and premises.</i><br>
<p>
Too true.  They were NOT having a logical argument.  Just as you and I are<br>
NOT having a logical argument about abortion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No</i><br>
<i>&gt;utopia is ever possible anywhere, any time, because there are such</i><br>
<i>&gt;conflicting ideals present in the world.  The abortion, infanticide, &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;euthanasia fight will go on and on and on, ending up in either the elite</i><br>
<i>&gt;accepting humane definitions of human, such as when Britain's elite</i><br>
<i>&gt;abolished slavery without a war, or the elite will attempt to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt;consensus by neutralizing or eliminating opponents who hold conflicting</i><br>
<i>&gt;definitions.  This is the tried and true method of tyranny.</i><br>
<p>
Well, yes.  You can't have a logical argument with a tyrant, I completely<br>
agree.  Fortunately for me, this was all that I was trying to prove in the<br>
first place.  :)<br>
<p>
Now, it is still possible that one premise, either the "pro-life" premise<br>
or the "pro-choice" premise, are more defensible based on OTHER premises<br>
which we do agree upon.  I'd like to think that this is true.  And indeed,<br>
Jones, I exhort you to seek out such an argument.  Don't just stick to your<br>
guns.  Branch out.  Seek out new arguments.  Because this one, to be blunt,<br>
is illogical.  (Not to mention ineffective!)<br>
<p>
On the other hand, perhaps rational parties who disagree about abortion<br>
cannot have a logical discussion about abortion, and anyone who claims to<br>
have a logical argument for or against abortion is either lying or<br>
confused.  To have a logical argument you MUST agree on premises, premises<br>
on which "pro-life" and "pro-choice" advocates may not ever agree.  If this<br>
is so, a logical argument is completely impossible.<br>
<p>
For our sakes, I hope this is not the case.<br>
