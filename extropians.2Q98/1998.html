<p>
There is a somewhat vocal group of libertarians who insist that an<br>
implicit contract is a void contract; parties must agree to the terms of a<br>
contract before they may be ethically enforced.  Can you show that this is<br>
wrong?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; In addition, you get even worse problems when the merchant is also</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; gateway that I have a copy of your manuscript available for anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sends me the price of a copy in anonymous cash.  I don't know to whom I'm</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; will impinge upon your ability to do business.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; b) nothing is totally anonymous. Anything on the net can be traced. As for your arguments about the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement, I can also say that the internet also gives IP enforcement agencies the ability to greatly reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cost of IP enforcement, at least in regards to web commerce. I think that these costs will be reduced enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it will totally offset, and then some, your imagined 'efficiency' of having no IP.</i><br>
<p>
Since I find this scenario interesting, I'm going to run it down step by<br>
step.  You tell me where and how I get caught.<br>
<p>
1)  I license the use of a copy of information you created.  2)  I encrypt<br>
an advertisement and a pseudonymous public key to Dave's public key,<br>
stating that I have a copy of your manuscript available for $0.05.<br>
Only Dave can read this message; Dave has agreed to broadcast e-mails<br>
which are sent to him via USENET. After enrypting it to Dave's key, I then<br>
encrypt the ciphertext to Carol's key, adding a message requesting that<br>
she send the e-mail to Dave; I encrypt that ciphertext to Bob's key with a<br>
message requesting that he send the e-mail to Carol and send the message<br>
to Bob.  3)  Bob decrypts the e-mail and sends his decrypted text to Carol<br>
as requested.  4) Carol, ignorant of who originated the e-mail beyond the<br>
fact that they sent it to Bob, decrypts her ciphertext and sends the<br>
remaining ciphertext to Dave. 5)  Dave decrypts the e-mail, ignorant of<br>
its author, and broadcasts it to USENET.  6)  Zed reads this message and<br>
decides to post $0.05 in anonymous money encrypted to my public key along<br>
with his own public key; he does so through a similar chain of anonymous<br>
remailers; no one but the first in the e-mail chain even knows who Zed is,<br>
no one but me knows what the message says, because Zed encrypted the<br>
e-mail to me before sending it along the chain.  7)  I encrypt a copy of<br>
your manuscript to Zed's public key and broadcast it anonymously.<br>
<p>
In this way, Zed and I can conduct a trade perfectly anonymously.  If the<br>
remailers do not keep a copy of the e-mail which they forward (they<br>
don't), then it is impossible to trace either myself or Zed.<br>
<p>
What are you going to do about this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But you are talking about a market. Markets are not markets of brand names, but of product types. The cola market</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not the Coca-Cola market, or the Pepsi market, but the cola market. Both have different recipes for cola,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which are protected by patent, both compete to satisfy the public demand for colas with different products. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot say that Coca-Cola has a monopoly on the cola market. Thus my assertion that a patent is not a monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt; stands.</i><br>
<p>
Well, let me put it to you this way:  any economist who knew anything at<br>
all about microeconomics would agree that Coca Cola charges more for Coke<br>
than it would if anybody could make Coke, and that this is because it is<br>
the only company that makes Coke.  They would also agree that increased<br>
prices lead to decreased quantity.  They would agree that this decreased<br>
quantity coupled with increased prices would represent deadweight loss, or<br>
economic inefficiency, and that all else being equal this will drag down<br>
the macroeconomy. <br>
<p>
If you don't want to call this a monopoly, that's OK with me, but please<br>
excuse me if I agree with the textbooks on this point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So you are for treating IP as a commodity. Any commodity market is going to trend toward an oligopoly situation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as economies of scale push smaller producers out or up in the market. Why is this? Because in the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; internet commerce, bandwidth is discounted for large users, and hardware like servers, routers, drive systems, CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; writers, etc. are all cheaper on a per kilobyte basis the larger capacity you go.</i><br>
<p>
Are you saying that it would be a natural monopoly?  If so, since when are<br>
libertarians opposed to natural monopolies?  Also, I disagree with your<br>
assertion that all commodity markets tend towards monopoly thanks to<br>
economies of scale.  There are lots and lots of commodities on the market<br>
that aren't monopolistic, never have been and don't look like they're<br>
about to become monopolistic in the near future.  The existence of such<br>
markets disproves your assertion that all commodity markets have this<br>
behavior, though it may nonetheless be true for IP.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In this scenario, the small home grown inventor is discouraged from becomeing a player in the market, unless they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are a rich bachelor who expects to get ripped off by the big boys, playing it off as if they are great</i><br>
<i>&gt; philanthropists, humantarians, etc..., or ulness the home grown inventor sells out to the established players in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the market. You are not encouraging a free market, but encouraging oligopoly/mercantilism.</i><br>
<p>
If you are correct, and it is more efficient for a monopoly or oligopoly<br>
to produce the goods than it is for small producers to compete (or sell to<br>
them), then by encouraging this process we are encouraging a free market;<br>
this is because in the case of a natural monopoly, the free market is not<br>
competitive.  I am not convinced that this is actually the case, but it<br>
does not help nor hinder either of our arguments if you are right on this<br>
point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes it is weird, but your numbers for the present market are not worth extrapolating from as it still is less</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 0.1 % of the market, yet even if LINUX catches on in the market beyond the hobbyist or iconoclast, companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; like Red Hat will not make any decent level of revinue, until one of the established companies, like Microsoft,</i><br>
<i>&gt; comes along and modifies the OS into something which it can protect, LinOS II. They then will promote this, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; soak up the entire market, putting Red Hat out of business, or back in the hat closet.</i><br>
<p>
Most Linux users would disagree; they argue that the reason Linux is good<br>
and growing (some say that it is already better than Microsoft's product) <br>
is because anyone is free to modify the source in any way they want, but<br>
they are also prevented from protecting their invention under the GPL. <br>
This means that it is easy for anyone with a good idea to improve the OS,<br>
rather than wait for Microsoft to release the next version of its<br>
bloatware. <br>
<p>
Also, if there were no IP laws, information like Linux would make up 100%<br>
of the market, not 0.1%.  Remember, I'm not trying to say that Linux is<br>
going to beat Microsoft in today's market; I'm just saying that Linux<br>
continues to improve despite the fact that nobody can protect their new<br>
Linux code.  This flies in the face of your assertion that if inventors do<br>
not receive royalties on their inventions, they will not invent.  They<br>
will invent, only slower. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would be a good thing. However I think that your expectation is wrong, and even if it does gain efficiency, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be because the commodity market for IP pushes invention supply into an oligopoly situation, which any self</i><br>
<i>&gt; proclaimed libertarian free marketer should abhor.</i><br>
<p>
I don't abhor natural monopolies, nor should any other free marketer. It's<br>
the COERCED monopolies that we have to worry about.  Also, I am not at all<br>
certain that the market for IP is naturally monopolistic, and I definitely<br>
disagree with your assertion that all commodity markets monopolize.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Considering that the economy is still pretty planned, with most industry still in the hands of Communist party</i><br>
<i>&gt; apparatchiks, I think that a) most of its economic growth is from externalization of western IP costs via</i><br>
<i>&gt; pirating of foreign owned IP properties, and the rest is b) from internal IP that is owned by state industries</i><br>
<i>&gt; and enforced by party apparatchiks with connections with police or army authorities, or c) small consumer</i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses, mostly in the service industries, that are privately owned.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think you can get much more qualitative than this analysis, which<br>
was all that I was trying to show.  This is not to say that it is wrong,<br>
necessarily, but simply that you can't do this quantitatively; you MUST be<br>
qualitative.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; yet you claim with a wave of your hand that nicroeconomic efficiency is beneficial for the macro economy without</i><br>
<i>&gt; showing HOW it benefits the macro economy, WHO in the macroeconomy truly benefits, and refuse to measure the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect in the macro economy of the disincentive to invent on the rate of invention, and reduction in productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; that results from stagnated technological development.</i><br>
<p>
Well, figure it out yourself.  The portion of surplus which is above the<br>
price line and below the demand curve is consumer surplus; that below the<br>
price line and above the supply curve is producer surplus.  If IP were to<br>
be eliminated, consumers would gain more than producers would in the copy<br>
market (see <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent3.gif">http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent3.gif</a> ); also, the<br>
increase in consumer surplus when demand increases is greater under<br>
perfect competition than under a monopoly, while producer surplus is<br>
greater under monopoly than under perfect competition, as noted.<br>
<p>
As for how it benefits the macroeconomy, you should know this perfectly<br>
well:  all else being equal, increased total microeconomic surplus results<br>
in increased nominal GDP.  However, this is similar to the argument for<br>
kids drinking milk:  all else being equal, a child will grow taller if<br>
they drink milk than if they don't drink milk.  How much taller?  I cannot<br>
say.  All I claim to know is that microeconomic efficiency is better for<br>
the economy than microeconomic inefficiency, but I cannot tell by how<br>
much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would love to see links or book refs to anything that shows that you can determine the relative size of two</i><br>
<i>&gt; shapes without knowing the quantitative size of either shape. Sounds like magic to me.</i><br>
<p>
Look, you want a REAL REAL simple example?  Suppose I have a triangle<br>
formed by the points (0,0), (x,0) and (y,0) and a triangle formed by<br>
(0,0), (z*x,0) and (y,0) where z is less than 1.  The latter triangle will<br>
have less area than the former triangle.  I have no idea what their areas<br>
will actually be, but I know their relative sizes on a qualitative level. <br>
No magic, just math. If I know enough about the supply and demand curves,<br>
then I can use the same "magic" on the area of the deadweight loss, the<br>
increase in revenues as demand increases, and the quantity produced by<br>
monoplists as opposed to that produced under competition. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yet you show no quantified relative size.</i><br>
<p>
I never claimed to!  Did you read my conclusion?  All I said was: "To<br>
conclude, if we let A be the area of the blue trapezoid under perfect<br>
competition, M be the area of the blue shape in the monopolistic diagram,<br>
D be the area of the grey triangle and E be the cost to society of<br>
enforcing IP laws, then we should eliminate IP laws if D + E &gt; M - A, or<br>
if A + D + E &gt; M."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, since you only count marginal costs, not fixed costs, your chart</i><br>
<i>&gt; is absolutely meaningless, especially in an IP marketplace, where almost all costs are fixed costs (i.e. R&amp;D),</i><br>
<i>&gt; while the marginal costs of reproduction are nil.</i><br>
<p>
Almost nil.  That was the low red line in the third graph.  As for fixed<br>
costs, you're right, they don't show up on the graph, but they were the<br>
central point of my use of those graphs: if the increase in revenues is<br>
greater than the fixed cost of invention, then invention will take place,<br>
if not, then it won't.  This was the principle I set out in bold; I<br>
believe it is the most robust part of my analysis because it is so<br>
trivial.  If you disagree with this part of the analysis, (and there's no<br>
reason why you should: a priori, you could still be right even if this<br>
were true) you'd better provide your OWN graphs showing why mine are<br>
wrong. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Additionally, your measure of efficiency, i.e. the quantity</i><br>
<i>&gt; made available in the marketplace, is wrong. The efficiency differential  is measured as the change in price</i><br>
<i>&gt; times the change in quantity.</i><br>
<p>
Gee.  Funny how the area on the supply/demand graph is given in precisely<br>
those units: Price times quantity.... SAY!  Wait a minute!  You don't<br>
suppose it's a microeconomic PRINCIPLE that the change in efficiency is<br>
given by the change in area on the supply/demand chart, do you?  Naw.  It<br>
couldn't be...<br>
<p>
Why do you think I spent all that time harping on about area, anyway???<br>
Geez.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In addition, you also only use straight lines in your graph, which any microeconomist can easily tell you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; simplistic and inaccurate of a real market. The demand, cost and monopolist market line all will tend to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; S-curves of one degree or another, depending on the product, the state of the art at that time, consumer</i><br>
<i>&gt; confidence and utility, etc. In a market with such S-curves, the efficiency gained can be reduced or amplified</i><br>
<i>&gt; over your straight lined graph, depending on how the lines intersect.</i><br>
<p>
As you surely realize, I used lines because they're shitloads easier to<br>
draw.  If you want to draw out your own graphs using S-curves, go right<br>
ahead.  I'm anxious to see them.  So long as your curves don't violate any<br>
principles, they will show the same qualitative results as mine do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Because it is thanks to piracy in other countries, it is unprofitable. Since a piracy enforcement agency, whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; a government or a PPL, cannot operate in a monopoly state jurisdiction without the expressed approval of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; state monopoly, and must operate within the legal guidlines set by that jurisdiciton, any state that wishes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; shelter piracy can make it unprofitable to enforce IP rights. Just as most terrorism and guerrilla warfare is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; successfull without the shelter and support from states outside the zone of conflict, IP piracy is only sucessful</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the direct participation, shelter and support of state monopolies.of power. Dont' make me label you a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pro-statist.</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand.  It would be unprofitable to produce tamper-proof<br>
software BECAUSE it is more tampered with in other countries?  Care to<br>
back this up a little more?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And it is just as easy to have programs written on a CD which automatically run when the CD is accessed. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; how viruses get away with their mischeif. While AV software may be able to wipe a virus on a floppy, a) on a CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is plenty of room for multiple copies to watch over each other, and b) a CD cannot be overwritten that</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily.</i><br>
<p>
Again, all I have to do is build a computer emulator that copies instead<br>
of executes (especially easy when we're talking about CDs) and all the AV<br>
software in the world wont help you as I burn myself an identical CD with<br>
all of the AV software intact, and pop it into my real computer.  The new<br>
CD is no different from the old CD as far as the software can tell; what<br>
will the AV programs detect if they are never executed? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Beg your pardon?  By precisely how much will the incentive to invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; change?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It can be measured by the percentage of patents issued which are brought to market with the help of measureable</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital investment. Since capital invested in such a risk investment will demand a given return on that</i><br>
<i>&gt; investment, if the total on investment is reduced by the lack of IP protection to the point that the given rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; of return on investment demanded by the capital market will dictate that the amount of money an inventor can</i><br>
<i>&gt; raise from investors for a given invention will decrease below the point required to bring the given invention to</i><br>
<i>&gt; market, then the inventor will not bring that particular invention to market. I don't have any data right now, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not making any blind guesses (unlike you).</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is all true.  However, how do you propose to measure the<br>
demanded return on investment on IP in America without IP laws, all else<br>
being equal?  China won't cut it; planned economies don't let this<br>
mechanism work at all.  You've got to use America and all else must be<br>
equal in order for this mechanism to apply; in other words, you can never<br>
make this measurement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; My argument has been qualitative, arguing that the incentive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invent would decrease, but not specifying absolutely by how much.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which is simply a cop out.</i><br>
<p>
Well, go get your data and we'll see how YOU do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And I say that since the supply of inventions will contract markedly, your pricing will not change much, until</i><br>
<i>&gt; consumer demand outstrips supply, due to population growth and limited resources, and no change in resource</i><br>
<i>&gt; utilization efficiencies do to stagnated tefhnological growth. At which point you will have inflation and</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic stagnation.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, interestingly enough, NOT if you are right about that natural<br>
monopoly thing.  In that case, the big monopoly on invention-commodities<br>
will have an incentive to pay a premium for inventions, up to but not<br>
exceeding the area of the blue shape in my incentive analysis.  Inventors<br>
will therefore have an incentive to invent given by this shape, just as it<br>
is today.  That is, in that case, the incentive to invest is EQUAL in both<br>
systems, as well as the deadweight loss.  The only difference, then, is<br>
the cost of enforcement; again, the vote in my favor, not yours.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, even if natural monopoly does not take place, the blue<br>
trapezoid under competition expands when the demand for inventions<br>
increses, so there IS a demand effect on the incentive to invest; again,<br>
smaller, but not zero. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yet any web server/router/backbone owner will have a contract with an insurance company to protect their assets,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially if they have capital leins on the equipment. In a libertarian world, any sane insurance company will</i><br>
<i>&gt; require that the network asset owner subject himself/herself to the authority of their contracted PPL. Most or</i><br>
<i>&gt; all PPLs will have interlocking contracts of enforcement. Thus you will be able to track anyone on the net that</i><br>
<i>&gt; vilates your IP contract, and you are covered by your IP protection clause in your insurance policy. Anyone you</i><br>
<i>&gt; license your property to will have to subject themselves in your license agreement to ajudication and enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; of your self licensed IP rights, ergo your PPL can do a network audit on your customers networks, on their ISP</i><br>
<i>&gt; routers, etc. In an internet world, the cost of IP enforcement will go down remarkably.</i><br>
<p>
I think I see.  So your PPA will go to the PPA(s) of all of those who<br>
reside on my anonymous remailer chain and get them to tell who I am.  The<br>
problem with this policy:  this is effectively key escrow, which has been<br>
proven many times over to be inefficient.  If you have to hand over your<br>
keys when the government/PPA says so, you can't do electronic commerce<br>
securely.  Period.  If e-commerce is more efficient than physical commerce<br>
(And there is a great deal of evidence that this is the case,) then<br>
enforcing key escrow results in economic inefficiency.  So again I fall<br>
back on Friedman's rule of thumb:  if it is economically inefficient, it<br>
will not be enforced under anarcho-capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The cost of invention is sunk, which means that it doesn't change the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shape of the supply curve.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your supply curve is higher than the other guy's supply curve, so this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clearly not the case.  Instead, we see from the graphs that invention is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; only profitable if the increased revenues from invention outweigh the sunk</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cost of invention; this incentive is smaller than that under a monopoly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but not zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that this is a totally bogus claim. You are completely off your rocker here.</i><br>
<p>
What?  That sunk costs do not result in competitive disadvantage? <br>
Competitive disadvantage is a technical term which refers only to the<br>
supply curve, which is really not affected by sunk costs, honest to<br>
goodness; you can go look it up.  Perhaps you meant something else?  The<br>
average cost curve?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Simplistic, basic microeconomic charts, any skilled economist will tell you, have ABSOLUTELY NO RELATION to any</i><br>
<i>&gt; real world microeconomic scenarios. To make generalizations from a generalization like you are doing is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; height of ignorant arrogance.</i><br>
<p>
Yet they will agree that microeconomic efficienccy does lead to increased<br>
GDP, ceteris paribus.  It's the ceteris paribus which most economists will<br>
catch you on, but since all I was trying to prove is that IP laws are<br>
economically bad for us compared to not having them, microeconomic<br>
efficiency is the perfect choice.<br>
