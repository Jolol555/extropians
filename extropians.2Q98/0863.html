<i>&gt;&gt;2.2) Axiom: Destroying the fundamentals of others' can damage their psyche</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and thereby reduce their well-being.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;THIS, I think, is the axiom over which we most disagree.  *I* would say</i><br>
<i>&gt;that if a person desired to listen and thereby have their fundamentals</i><br>
<i>&gt;destroyed, and they did so, then they would actually be BETTER off as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;result, because they got what they desired.  (By axiom A2.2.)  I would go</i><br>
<i>&gt;on to say that since your axiom does not seem to take this into account,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have an entirely different system of moral value than I do.  As you may</i><br>
<i>&gt;have already noticed, I am a utilitarian, and believe utility to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;intrisically valuable.  What, precisely, is your theory of morality?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Oh, how much room do I get? Basically, high-quality information is "good",<br>
low-quality information is "bad", but there are several criteria for<br>
quality, one of which is the context in which the information is presented,<br>
and if the context is that you're talking to a fundamentalist lunatic and<br>
you know that the information you present can harm this person, the quality<br>
of your information is not optimal, because you would have to present it in<br>
small, digestable chunks instead of revealing everything at once.<br>
<p>
I suggest we cease discussion about the fundamental principles of Extropian<br>
beliefs for now (regarding the definition and evidence for faithfulness), I<br>
will do a in-depth analysis of the Principles as soon as my time allows it,<br>
and it is better to discuss on such a basis than to simply exchange<br>
opinions. And probably less annoying to the rest of the audience.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
