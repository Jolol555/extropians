I'm not sure I understand. I think we agree that MNT includes both the<br>
itty-bitty machinery (assemblers, etc) and the control of that machinery.<br>
You seem to be saying "OK, we may learn how to build the machinery, but building<br>
the proper control systems is a lot harder."<br>
<p>
My analysis is very different. I feel that nanotech will have a profound effect<br>
as soon as the machinery is available, even if we are constrained to today's<br>
computational levels for control. A single assembler arm operating under control<br>
of a macro-scale computer should be able to build a logic fabrication factory<br>
in a matter of a few weeks, even if it has to spend a portion of that time<br>
building replacements for itself and doing testing and rework. Therefore, <br>
I believe that given an assembler and one of today's desktop computers, It<br>
should be possible to build a supercomputer factory on your desktop. Well over half<br>
of the current cost of computer components reflects the cost of the fab lines, and<br>
most of the rest reflects operating and materials costs.<br>
<p>
IMO a similar approach can build any simple diamondoid macro-scale part, such as<br>
window panes, bricks, pre-cut building lumber, many machine parts, etc.<br>
<p>
For any increase in the capabilities of the control system you should expect<br>
an increase in the achievable complexity of the result. If by "advanced nanotechnology"<br>
you mean the abiltity to make things other than diamondoid, such as potatoes, then<br>
I agree, we need something qualitatively advanced from the "robot factory" model.<br>
However, the IMO the robot factory generating diamondoid parts is easily achievable in<br>
the 2005-2015 timeframe. This technoligy is sufficient to completely obsolete all<br>
current capital equipment. If the groundwork in AI based on massively parallel computing<br>
is in place when the assember is developed, then the assembler-built superconputers will<br>
also precipitate the singularity.<br>
