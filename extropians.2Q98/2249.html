<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

  IAN: It was interesting how the left-wing Washington <br>
  Post pushed the lager pharmaceutical company Merck's<br>
  effort to ban the competition backed with a disinfo <br>
  spin from the vitamin-control activists at the so <br>
  called "Center for Science in the Public Interest,"<br>
  while the right-wing paper, the Washington Times,<br>
  made the case for the smaller company that sells<br>
  the rice yeast product. The Center of Science in<br>
  the Public interest sure serves as an ideal "Oh <br>
  what about the children and public interest?" cover<br>
  for the promotion of the most "crass mercantilism"!<br>
<p>
  The left-wing spin would be, "Look at that Washington<br>
  Times supporting the profits of this yeast dealer at<br>
  the cost of the "Public Interest," when in fact the<br>
  left are supporting the very worst example of the<br>
  capitalist monopoly they so lament as the great <br>
  threat of the free market. I've seen attacks on<br>
  the vitamin industry in the media that frame it<br>
  up as a "mutlimillion-dollar greed fest," when <br>
  all the "Public-Interest People" against vitamins<br>
  are in fact pushing the case for the super-mega<br>
  wealthy multinational pharmaceutical giants to<br>
  the immediate detriment of the public interest.<br>
  The pro-Govt case is the inverse of the truth.<br>
<p>
  I recall seeing left-wing "consumer activist" <br>
  Ralph Nader saying on CNN's Crossfire that he<br>
  sees no problem with the average time it takes<br>
  to approve drugs increase from 10 to 20 years.<br>
  How many little companies could afford the costs<br>
  of doubling all research expenses? Only giants.<br>
<p>
  I believe all socialist polices result in higher<br>
  prices and/or great scarcities of resources, and<br>
  as such hurt most the very population they purport <br>
  to be the "beneficiaries" of their social planning,<br>
  and consolidate the power of select elite monopolies.<br>
