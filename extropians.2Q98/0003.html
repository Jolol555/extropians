That means nothing, not even an electron, retains its (vernacular)<br>
identity from one moment to the next.  I guess Fluffy isn't Fluffy after<br>
all.<br>

You're forgetting rotation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   just as the identity</i><br>

<p>
for "derived" read "measured"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   not from A but from the relation of A to not-A, just</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as the identity of A is derived not from A but from</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the relation of A to not-A. It's so obvious and per-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   fectly consistent.</i><br>
<p>
Consistent with itself, yes, but not with how the word _identity_ has<br>
been used consistently by everyone else ever since it was coined.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Self-relation is null, is 0.</i><br>
<p>
Is zero not a number?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   All identity attributes are derived by the relation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A to things that are different than A.  This claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of identity I make is physically proven,</i><br>
<p>
Attributes are not the same thing as identity.<br>
You confuse identity with description.<br>
<p>
Refute that, smart guy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   the evidence for it is virtually unlimited.</i><br>
<p>
How come you get to use tautologies as evidence, and I don't?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;   for the atomist theory of identity is universally</i><br>
<i>&gt;   contradicted, and yet it is the prevailing theory.</i><br>
<p>
As usual, you confuse definition with theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   It is a crackpot meme that has infected the mass.</i><br>
<p>
You know, usually when someone says "everyone is wrong" we call him<br>
paranoid.<br>
