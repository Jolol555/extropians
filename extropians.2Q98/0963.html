<i>&gt; From: ChuckKuecker &lt;ckuecker@mcs.net&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; We have never seen a true free market on Earth, far as I can see. Maybe we</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to try it before dismissing it out of hand..</i><br>
<p>
A true "free market" world could very well work (I really don't know, and neither<br>
does anyone else), but it is utopic. There will always be concentrations of<br>
power ("governments"), and people that will use that power for their own benefit <br>
and at the expense of others (as long as there *are* people, that is). It makes<br>
more sense to improve the concept of government than to pursue some<br>
free market anarcho-capitalist illusion. Maybe Powers will have a free market<br>
...maybe not.<br>
