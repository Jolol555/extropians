D.L. Crocker wrote 4/11/98: &lt;If it were legal to secede from democratic<br>
decisions, the people who did so would have to either hire others to<br>
provide the services they opted out of, or form other collectives to<br>
provide them: in other words, anarcho-capitalism.&gt;<br>
<p>
Agreed.  One of my critique's of David Brin's "Transparent Society" is that<br>
all his emphasis is on some mystical idol called "accountability."  But<br>
secession is the surest way to secure liberty for a consensual moral polity<br>
that is diverging (in the evolutionary sense) from those polities around<br>
it.  Secession, not accountability, because accountability only works when<br>
the core ideals and core purposes are consensually agreed on within a<br>
polity (or at minimum acquiesced to).  If those ideals and purposes have<br>
diverged, then secession is the only option. Anarcho-capitalism, as you<br>
have used it above, would have to be *very* broadly defined to fit all the<br>
different configurations that secession would form and preserve.<br>
<p>
Back in the Roman Republic, the plebes used to secede to the Palatine Hill<br>
until the patricians granted concessions to freedom.  The oligarchy worked<br>
fine as long as the old Roman religion was firmly in the hearts of the<br>
elite and the people.  But as Greek cynicism and skepticism worked its way<br>
into Roman society to undermine the old religion, the oligarchy became more<br>
tyrannical because they decided that man was the measure of all things and<br>
therefore might made right.  The plebes seceded and seceded, each time<br>
gaining more freedom.  But as the policemen inside the population's head<br>
went away, more and more policemen outside their head were required.  The<br>
freedom gained through secessions threatened to turn into anarchy, i.e.,<br>
non-stop civil wars between mafia dons.  The oligarchy, in response,<br>
crystallized into a single ruler to impose order and stop the anarchy. <br>
Attempts to replace the old religion with a secular morality resulted in<br>
the split between the stoicism of the elite and the epicureanism of the<br>
slobs.  The crystallization of the oligarchy behind a single ruler won out<br>
over anarchy largely because the self-discipline of stoicism will always<br>
trump the hedonism of epicureanism.  The fall occurring from the older more<br>
extropic republic towards first entropic anarchy, then to entropic<br>
totalitarianism was the natural result of the loss of the old religion and<br>
the failure of the secular morality designed to replace it.  Secession did,<br>
indeed, work to provide more freedom, but the freedom was lost because of a<br>
loss of self-discipline.  You cannot hold mafia dons accountable, you can<br>
only beat 'em, accommodate 'em or try to get away from 'em.<br>
<p>
BTW, I'm reading a delightful book by Walter Pater called "Marius the<br>
Epicurean" (1885) set in Rome c.200.  The dynamic optimism I feel about our<br>
material advances is not matched by any advances in our modern writing<br>
abilities over this.<br>
