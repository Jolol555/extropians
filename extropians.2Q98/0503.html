<p>
The only downside of being trans/post human is perhaps that you have <br>
too many choices. A kid in a candy store.<br>
<p>
You can strip yourself down to become a streamlined intelligence, to<br>
better compete with ALife golems. You can become Omega. Or impersonate <br>
the devil pretty well. Or go back being a bland, boring vanilla human, <br>
either with remembrances of godhood, or a tabula rasa existance. Or be <br>
a Mouse from Mars. Or whatever. You can become super-rational. Or <br>
completely instinct-driven. It's all up to you.<br>
<p>
Personally, I am very fond of diverse mythologies, particularly<br>
Chinese, Finnish and Irish. I'd like to rectify the fact that these <br>
persons/beings never had a chance to exist. Call me a neoromantic, if <br>
you wish.<br>
