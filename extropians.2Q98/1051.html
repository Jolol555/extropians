I have been on the extropians mailing list now for a few months and I've<br>
noticed that very few posts are made in respect to short term views.  While<br>
it's commendable to be visionary I would think that many extropians would<br>
concern themselves with what could be done presently to assure a transhumanist<br>
existence in the future.  Is there much collaboration on this level?  I would<br>
like to take more of an activist's position in exploring transhumanist<br>
avenues.  Any recommendations?<br>
