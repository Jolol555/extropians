People were invited to the list who didn't join.  About half the initial<br>
invitation list, in fact.  And it's not just my judgement; Robin helped a lot<br>
on the initial list, and I run to him and Carl Feynman for advice.<br>
<p>
That said, I'm not perfectly happy with the list myself.  But I'd like less<br>
Singularity type stuff, not more.  I've thought of raiding a few Names from<br>
the SF newsgroups, but haven't yet.<br>

Start similar lists, with other hosts.  I've thought of polymath-list as a<br>
"neo-Enlightenment salon".  Nothing wrong with multiple salons and polite<br>
competition.  The technical barriers to entry are pretty low.  The reputation<br>
barrier is higher, of course; rather like Internet banking.<br>
<p>
Tip: it may help if the host is not the youngest person on the list.  And the<br>
host should be willing to look around for good new blood, whereas I need to<br>
focus more on my life, and these days skim most of extropians, even the<br>
intellectual property thread.<br>
