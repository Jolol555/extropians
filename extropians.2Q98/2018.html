I don't know what OS and hardware combination you are using Michael, but<br>
this is not the case for PCs.<br>
I thought we'd already cleared this up;<br>
<p>
1)  Any copy protection scheme can be defeated in theory, and almost<br>
certainly will be in practice if there is a high enough benefit for doing<br>
so.  If your protection doesn't go at least as far as chip-specific<br>
licensing and hardware dongle then you ain't even trying - and these have<br>
proven to be ineffective.  To date, the cost of hacking any copy protection<br>
has proven to be minuscule compared with the benefit of doing so.  Nothing<br>
in any of the schemes you have mentioned (or any I know of) fix this<br>
problem, or in fact offer any significant additional cost to the hacker.<br>
<p>
2)  To quote Gary Larson, "On the internet, no one knows you're a dog."  The<br>
only way I can think of where you could possibly ensure that you can catch<br>
the customer who broke your contract and began distributing pirate copies is<br>
if you took physical biometric data from each one of them and encoded it<br>
into the software at the time of purchase.  Needless to say this rules out<br>
any selling of your software on the internet, and is not very useful if you<br>
are looking for something to keep the cost of IP enforcement down.  Also not<br>
something I'd like to see a libertarian arguing in favour of  :-)<br>
<p>
IP is going to have to get along without needing any of the above if it is<br>
going to have any chance of 'efficiency' in the info-economy.  Anything else<br>
will carry a massive overhead that dwarfs any supposed benefits to the owner<br>
of the IP.  &lt;cliche&gt; Information wants to be free &lt;/cliche&gt;<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;As far as I can tell, any time you put a CD in a drive, or any other</i><br>
<i>&gt;disk in a drive, the drive checks the boot sector of the drive. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt;how you can get a virus from an infected floppy simply by sticking the</i><br>
<i>&gt;disk in the drive. You do not need to 'look at it' in order to give the</i><br>
<i>&gt;virus a go at your system. Granted you could use a specially rigged CD</i><br>
<i>&gt;copying machine, but these are expensive devices, not likely to be owned</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the casual pirate. This cost of entry limits potential pirates to</i><br>
<i>&gt;those with the capital to take the risk. Thus this limits the potential</i><br>
<i>&gt;pirates, and eases enfocement.</i><br>
