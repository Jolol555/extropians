den Otter wrote 4/12/98: &lt;Morality itself is usually based on selfish<br>
hedonism: you (for ex.) help people because it "feels right", increases<br>
your self-asteem and you don't hurt people because that would you feel bad<br>
about yourself.  Of course "feeling good" or "feeling bad" can also be<br>
dependent <br>
on what *others* think of you. So you're either pleasing yourself directly <br>
or pleasing the crowd (to please yourself).&gt;<br>
<p>
The qualifier "usually" is interesting here.  Let me be explicit about<br>
whose morality "usually" is based on selfish hedonism:  animals and<br>
animal-like humans.  Now, for the missing part of morality, for the<br>
morality developed by humans who do not behave as ape-like thugs trying to<br>
climb to the next branch up in a fetid jungle, it is not based on selfish<br>
hedonism.  It is based on choosing an ideal, a purpose in life, an attempt<br>
at a great achievement in the future, etc.  It arises from the unified,<br>
coherent answers to the human (not animal) questions such as: why is there<br>
something and not nothing, why am I here, what should my purpose be, how<br>
should I fulfull my purpose, how should I get along with these other beings<br>
around me, etc.  Once you've decided on your purposes, besides the<br>
homeostatic purposes of survival and reproduction that nature has endowed<br>
you with, and the purposes you've chosen don't conflict, you develop moral<br>
values that will lead to the fulfillment of your chosen purposes.<br>
<p>
Principles are rational choices, purposes are chosen prior to rationality. <br>
Deciding to be rational, to aim at truth, is not a rational choice, it is<br>
pre-rational or moral.  These moral values, in turn, filter which<br>
perceptions are allowed to penetrate your consciousness, in the learning<br>
process, and which concepts are deposited in memory.  Your moral worldview<br>
colors the entirety of the way you think, what you sense, what you<br>
remember, which in turn, is inextricably connected to the motor-cortical<br>
system of the behavior of your body.  If you have the morality of selfish<br>
hedonism, you will think like a lower animal and behave like a lower<br>
animal, not like a higher human.  Reflection and abstraction are a surer<br>
guide to morality that works to preserve and enhance higher life than any<br>
set of feelings.  This is why high standards of morality, which develop<br>
subtlety and refined judgments, will always work to elevate the human<br>
condition, while dropping standards of morality will always work to degrade<br>
the human condition.  Pleasure and suffering, happiness and unhappiness are<br>
lower animal guides to moral standards, not higher human guides.<br>
<p>
&lt;There are plenty of other elements when it comes to the moral memetic<br>
system, of course, but they all are more or less based on the punishment vs<br>
reward system, whether the subject realizes this or not. "Morals" and<br>
"ethics" are not some metaphysical, divine spark that's unique to (some)<br>
humans, but rather primitive impulse mixed with some logic.&gt;<br>
<p>
They are not based on some external punishment vs reward system, they are<br>
based on the choice of purposes, the values that attend that choice, and<br>
the behavior, in the co-evolutionary environment with other beings, that<br>
will lead to their fulfillment.  This is an interior system, isolated from<br>
all observation or participation by outsiders.  Volitional freedom is<br>
central to the higher human, and is what is missing in lower animal life,<br>
the freedom to choose courses not set at nature's table for us.  Higher<br>
morals arise from coherent answers to the metaphysical questions, they have<br>
little to do with primitive impulse.<br>
<p>
&lt;ER certainly encourages self-disciple [sic], because it's very rational<br>
(useful).&gt;<br>
<p>
I think you meant self-discipline here, rather than self-disciple, although<br>
Enlightened Rationalism as you have sketched it out, amounts to the same<br>
thing.  Perhaps instead of my earlier "Sophomoric Parisitism", E.R. would<br>
be even more appropriately called "Self-Discipleship".  Rationality and<br>
usefulness are not equivalents.  Also, I would point out that earlier you<br>
wrote what is obviously the key tenet to E.R., namely: "So if you feel like<br>
it, and think that you can get away with it... by all means go ahead!" <br>
This is the very antithesis of self-discipline, and betrays the incoherency<br>
and dishonesty in your version of E.R.  It is the prime tenet of lower<br>
animal life, and human barbarism.<br>
<p>
&lt;"Infantile desires" are the core of our being, instead of blindly<br>
suppressing them as you imply we should try to control their flow in such a<br>
way that we get the most out of life.&gt;<br>
<p>
You are certainly qualified to speak for yourself in this regards, but<br>
please don't presume to speak for me.  Infantile desires were the core of<br>
my being when I was an infant, but I am no longer an infant.  <br>
<p>
&lt;It is much more effective to reduce the number of rules (and dogmatism) to<br>
a bare minimum, and base them on common sense instead of ideas that fly in<br>
the face of human nature and logic.&gt;<br>
<p>
And what is common sense but induction?  Moral systems based on common<br>
sense are called traditions or peasant logic.  You make a case for sticking<br>
to habit and custom here.  A good example of common sense for you<br>
personally goes something like this: "When I was a child, I spake as a<br>
child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a<br>
man, I put away childish things."  Is that what you mean by "bare minimum"<br>
rules?<br>
<p>
Ideas that fly in the face of human nature are necessary for both<br>
self-improvement and improvement of the human condition in general.  It is<br>
human nature to take the easy way out, to focus on the immediate to the<br>
detriment of society at large, to take no thought of future generations and<br>
to dishonor the sacrifices (the moral capital) of past generations.  Humans<br>
default to entropic barbarism unless ideas that fly in the face of<br>
barbarism are promulgated and upheld.  High moral standards were always<br>
present at the extropic peaks in history.<br>
<p>
&lt;E.R. firmly assumes that being alive is preferable to being dead. However,<br>
this does not force the individual who values his own life to act in a<br>
"life promoting" way towards *other* life forms. That's a *personal<br>
choice*, for which one must carry *personal responsibility*.&gt;<br>
<p>
Does the courtesy of preferring being alive to being dead extend to unborn<br>
children, burdensome sick and old people?  Oh, I guess not, E.R.'s moral<br>
teachings don't include life promotion extended to others.  How convenient.<br>
 Calling it a "personal choice" is self-evident but then there's that nasty<br>
word so prominent in moral systems that are rivals to the moral system of<br>
E.R., namely "must."  Why must they carry personal responsibility?  Who<br>
says so?  Responsibility to whom?  To those they murder?  To themselves? <br>
What could that possibly mean except license to murder?  Where, in the<br>
moral universe of E.R., which states that "So if you feel like it, and<br>
think that you can get away with it... by all means go ahead!" could there<br>
be any room for personal responsibility?  Obviously, this is another<br>
incoherent, dishonest tenet.<br>
