At which point, at the request of the Tongan government the US sends over<br>
a few stealth fighters (aka small stealth bombers) with laser-guided bombs<br>
and you don't wake the next morning. Surely you can't honestly believe<br>
that any US president is going to sit by quietly while you set up a free<br>
country anywhere on the planet? Either you stay within their definition of<br>
"freedom" (e.g. no selling drugs, no gun-running, no bioweapons, no "child<br>
porn", no giving haven to "terrorists") or you're going to become Global<br>
Enemy #1. And you can't prevent those things in a free country.<br>

Oh yeah, you can use anthrax and nerve gas on passing warships and no-one<br>
is going to take action against you. Get real.<br>
<p>

<p>
Exactly. But such tactics are only possible if you already have those<br>
weapons ready to use. The only tactic which will keep the US government<br>
out of your country is to call up the President and say "hey, we've got<br>
nukes in various major cities which will detonate if we don't send them<br>
a valid code every ten minutes. Attack us and they go off." Only immediate,<br>
massive retaliation will stop them, not a vague threat of future attacks.<br>
<p>
As Erwin Strauss says, don't even think about it without weapons of mass<br>
destruction at your command, *and* the willingness to use them in defence.<br>
