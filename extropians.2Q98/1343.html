<i>&gt;But how bad will it really be? How will the y2k problem affect simple </i><br>
<i>&gt;things like your PC, web access and email? For example, can we </i><br>
<i>&gt;expect this list to crash? (now *there's* something really serious)... </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Well, my 1/2000 cents worth sez: <br>
<p>
Anyone running mainframe or old minicomputer software, even if ported<br>
to PCs will probably have problems - especially those who are already<br>
trying to fix said Y2K problems, cause the final bugs will not appear<br>
for some time past 1 Jan 2000.... (the less than obvious situations<br>
are rare). OTOH, a Pc running Windows 95 or the like is likely to have<br>
few if any problems. Embedded systems are also likely to be Y2K free<br>
except for those whose applications depend on calendrical dates. I<br>
think date dependent embedded apps are rare, I've never seen one<br>
anyway. (Your ostrich POV here....)<br>
<p>
I doubt the list would crash, as Majordomo is a Uniz app as I recall,<br>
and the Unix Y2K equivalent is about 25 years from now...<br>
<p>
BTW, the PC, web access and email are NOT simple! They just seem to be<br>
cuz a lot of work has gone into them to make them fairly easy to use!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Something else: everybody's talking about the negative sides of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;alleged crash, but as with most disasters there must be ways to</i><br>
<i>&gt;(greatly) profit from it. Although most people got hit in for example</i><br>
<i>&gt;the crash of '29, some became millionaires overnight. There must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;ways to profit from the (potential) chaos that will follow the y2k</i><br>
<i>&gt;problem, and not just as a programmer. It would be stupid to let</i><br>
<i>&gt;a golden opportunity like this one pass...Any suggestions? ;-)</i><br>
<p>
I mentioned this some months ago, that one possible good aspect of Y2K is<br>
that it might force businesses running ancient legacy software to finally<br>
do a total upgrade, and properly so the documentation and source code won't<br>
evaporate like the legacy stuff did. Some of these people are running<br>
emulators of emulators, so there are performance advantages too. The real<br>
losers are those whose legacy software doesn't crash...<br>
<p>
As for profiteering, go down to the hardware store and buy generators,<br>
Coleman lanterns and general disaster supplies. I expect my water to be OK,<br>
gas maybe, and my electrical to be flaky for at least a week... So if you<br>
live in the northeast, take a vacation in Arizona....<br>
