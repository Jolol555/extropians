Some creationists may not be stupid but their idea is ridiculous, it's  <br>
probably wrong too.<br>

They're free to believe whatever they like and I'm free to believe <br>
creationists are silly and that you're giving them far more respect than they <br>
deserve. I agree that science does not have a very deep explanation for why <br>
there is something rather than nothing, but at least scientists are smart <br>
enough to recognize that limitation. I have contempt for creationists because <br>
they foolishly think they've tied up all the loose ends and have completely <br>
solved this very profound problem with one simple idea. "Existence exists <br>
because God exists" is certainly simple, it's downright retarded in fact, <br>
but a theory that complicates things and immediately rases an obvious <br>
question almost identical and every bit as profound as the one it claims to<br>
answer is not a theory at all, it's a joke.<br>
