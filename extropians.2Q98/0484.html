I am posting this response because the author of the previous posting<br>
has so blatantly mnisrepresented my views that I feel compelled to<br>
respond.  I think, in all honesty, he has misrepresented my<br>
eschatological views worse than anyone I have read, which has to be some<br>
sort of record.  [Eschatology refers to the doctrine of the last<br>
things.]<br>

As I wrote before, Gary North is a religious fundamentalist who<br>
is well known among Christian millennialists (believers in the<br>
near-term apocalyptic events foretold in the Book of Revelations).<br>
He has written dozens of books on religious topics, focusing on<br>
issues related to the coming apocalypse, long before he heard<br>
of Y2K.  Here is an excerpt from a review of one of his books, at:<br>
<p>
NORTH:  On the contrary, I am an anti-premillennialist<br>
(anti-apocalypticist), and I have spent about a million dollars to<br>
publish books against apocalypticism.  For this reason I am distrusted<br>
by the fundamentalist leadership.  I am what is known as a<br>
postmillennialist, a position that is anti-apocalyptic to the core.  <br>
<p>
For this reason, my stand on Y2K is not understood by my many<br>
fundamentalist critics.  They regard my views Y2K as too apocalyptic. <br>
My views sound far more like what they believe.  <br>
<p>
By the way, the biblical book is called (by Protestants) Revelation, not<br>
Revelations.  Anyone who refers to "The Book of Revelations" exposes<br>
himself as someone who has never read that document.  <br>
<p>
My critic does not understand the nature of the intense rivalry of the<br>
three major eschatological schools of opinion.  The following extract<br>
reveals my view, clearly stated: anti-premilleninial, anti-amillennial,<br>
and therefore anti-apocalyptic.  Read it for yourself.  My critic read<br>
it but did not understand it.<br>
<p>

<p>
: Here is the main question: Will Jesus' Great Commission be fulfilled<br>
in<br>
: history? Will nations be discipled by the Church? Will God bring<br>
judgment<br>
: against His enemies in history? Most important, do we have enough time<br>
: for the healing power of the gospel to do its work?  Two millennial<br>
views<br>
: say no, there isn't enough time: premillennialism and amillennialism<br>
: ("pessimillennialism"). A third view says yes, there is enough time:<br>
: post-millennialism. The revival of interest in this third view has<br>
: taken both rival camps by surprise. By tying a vision of victory in<br>
: history to the doctrine that the Bible offers specific answers to<br>
social<br>
: problems, a new movement has begun to capture the minds of a<br>
generation<br>
: of Christian activists. The movement is called Christian<br>
Reconstruction.<br>
: In Millennialism and Social Theory, Dr. Gary North, co-founder of this<br>
: movement, examines why both pre-millennialism and amillennialism have<br>
: never developed independent social theories, and why the spokesmen of<br>
: both positions appeal to the prevailing ethics of contemporary<br>
humanism<br>
: as the only possible way to run society.<br>
<p>
I believe North sees Y2K in religious terms, as an element of the "end<br>
times" which have long been foretold.  His Y2K site is largely secular,<br>
until you read the bulletin boards where some of his long time followers<br>
retain their religious views.<br>
<p>
NORTH: On the contrtary, I think the "end times" began in the first<br>
century -- an anti-premillennial, anti-apocalyptic viewpoint.  Y2K has<br>
nothing to do with the so-called end times promoted by fundamentalists,<br>
because those end times are a misrepresentation of what the New<br>
Testament teaches.  For saying this for over 30 years, I have gained<br>
considerable opposition from fundamentalists.  As the previous extract<br>
said, I am opposed to end-times madness (the book title by one of my<br>
co-authors, Gary DeMar).<br>
<p>
The point is, North is filtering the data he presents through his<br>
religious ideas.  It is a biased presentation designed to lead to the<br>
desired apocalyptic conclusion.<br>
<p>
NORTH: Again, I will say it: I am an anti-apocalypticist.  No one who<br>
has read my eschatological views, and the views of those whom I have<br>
published, could say such a thing.  My critic has not read my books or<br>
the books of those whom I have published.  So, he should refrain from<br>
commenting on my eschatological views.  <br>
<p>
Given the remarkable confusion in his critique ("The Book of<br>
Revelations"), I doubt very seriously that the author has ever read a<br>
book on eschatology.  He should stick with his own specialty.<br>
<p>
Please deal with my Web site for what it is: a warning on Y2K, not a<br>
warning about the end of the world.<br>
