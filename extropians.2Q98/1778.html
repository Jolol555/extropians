    This is the 21'st update on my fly longevity experiments. Since flies<br>
 used in run #8 had been pre-aged in holding bottles containing taurine<br>
 larvicide for 29 days prior to use, the remaining life spans are shorter<br>
 than those from the previous run.<br>
    The results were very disappointing with acetyl-carnosine, and I have<br>
 no explanation for why the flies given this died so quickly. However the<br>
 poor result with almond powder was anticipated. This was the first time I<br>
 have tested something that I was fairly confident would reduce life span.<br>
 Unlike mammals, the dietary "essential" fatty acid requirement for flies<br>
 is zero, and all tests with various added fats have yielded reduced life<br>
 spans. However monosaturated fats had never been tested before, so I<br>
 decided to try this with the almond powder.<br>
   It looks like aged garlic powder, and the lower dosage of chili have a<br>
 mild pro-longevity effect. Both the lower doses of cardamon, and<br>
 corriander might also be slightly beneficial before tissue levels<br>
 accumulate to a toxic level. I will have to check out extra low<br>
 concentrations of these some time.<br>
   For the ninth run I am testing a very high dosage (8X) of hawthorn,<br>
 since the Hawthorn 4X did so well in the seventh run. Otherwise I am<br>
 continuing to test the spice cabinet in this latest run. Flies were<br>
 pre-aged for only 17 days, since about 75% of them had died by this time.<br>
 This shorter holding period may be due to the current higher temperatures<br>
 accelerating age associated mortality in drosophilia. These insects now<br>
 show great reluctance in attempting flight, which is typical of aged<br>
 flies.<br>
