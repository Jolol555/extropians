Only rich people are allowed to bring their inventions to market.<br>
<p>
A poor person cannot bring his own invention to market, because he <br>
doesn't have the money -- and he also can't pay up if his invention <br>
doesn't work out.<br>
<p>
Besides, oftentimes even a basic description of an invention is <br>
sufficient to reinvent it.  For example, try to describe a <br>
Frisbee(tm) well enough to garner interest, but *not* well enough <br>
that a toy manufacturer could reinvent it himself just from your <br>
description. <br>
