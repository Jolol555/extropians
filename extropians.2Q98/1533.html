<i>        &gt;First I normalised the guesses at each of the numbers in the</i><br>

I don't understand why you did this. If people pick birthday numbers then <br>
they must have had a hunch that these numbers will win, in general their <br>
hunch was wrong but I'll bet many, perhaps most, who picked birthday numbers <br>
and won are convinced there is some sort of mystical connection. I don't <br>
think it's justified to throw out a hunch because its illogical, it's no more<br>
illogical than a hunch that a non birthday number will win.<br>

<i>        &gt;I did locate a very weird effect in which the *most drastically         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;deviant positive residuals correlated with targets to a far greater         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;extent than one would expect by chance*. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
It seems that no matter how large the study is this is where psi is always <br>
hiding, at a few very rare events at the very extreme of the statistical <br>
distribution, and it is here where it's the most dangerous to make far <br>
reaching conclusions because error is so easy to make.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I assume that each guess is independent, and therefore each perfect         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;entry requires 6 `psi-mediated events' </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If it's difficult to predict the winning lottery number that are determined <br>
by only 6 simple events then how can it predict earthquakes , the rise and <br>
fall of empires, the weather, and the stock market, they're caused by a lot <br>
more than 6 simple events.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There's a kind of pyramid generated, in which almost all the fairly        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;infrequent psi events you'd expect in such a population will be         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;wasted on people who would otherwise by chance get only zero, one,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;two, or three right.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
In the USA you can win about 10$ if you guess 3 out of the 6 numbers in any  <br>
order, the number of these small winners is in the millions and the number is <br>
just what you'd expect if the psi effect was zero.<br>
<p>
My basic problem with ESP is that we could be having this same conversation a <br>
100 years ago, and in fact people did. I don't demand that the psi effect be <br>
explained, I just want it proven to exist, and after a century of trying to <br>
do this the progress has been precisely zilch, the evidence stunk then and it <br>
stinks now. I think it's time to move on to more promising areas of <br>
exploration.<br>
