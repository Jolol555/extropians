I have thought about such problem several months ago. To combat the more<br>
mindless address harvesters, trivially mangling addresses (or even<br>
stripping the archives from them altogether) would seem enough. The more<br>
advanced solution would seem to allocate (informative) list-locally unique<br>
handles (like, say, your name) to each participant. This can be done<br>
either automatically, or interactively via a web form. The listserv would<br>
then substitute your real addresses with the abovementioned handles. There<br>
should be no user accessible mechanism to query for real physical mailing<br>
list addresses -- this will make list spamming by mail header forging<br>
pretty difficult. It can get arbitrarily involved here, with groups,<br>
crypto, and whatnot but I realise this to be completely unrealistic as no<br>
one will ever code it.<br>
<p>
Btw: here's a suggestion to make proposed extropy-moderated more<br>
palatable. If there is a extropy-rejected list (called entropy?), which<br>
receives all the rejected mail but spam, subbing to both lists will make<br>
you get the whole picture. On the high end I would contemplate adding an<br>
inner circle with good S/N ratio, similiarly to the service Damien<br>
Sullivan is offering, only bidirectional. <br>
<p>
As for distributed moderation (we could make a vote whether the<br>
self-designed moderator group is acceptable) we could borrow the scheme<br>
from the Internet Oracle (instead of askme's authenticated check-in and<br>
check-out, of course). <br>

Please comment.<br>
