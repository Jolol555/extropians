<p>
Perhaps I should clarify my position.  Yes again, the level of discussion on the polymath<br>
list is quite high and I have gleamed some very useful insights from it over the past few<br>
months.  I especially like the input of Anders Sandberg, Robin Hanson and Nick Bostrom.<br>
<p>
However, in the end, it is the intrinsically elitist and *fallible* judgment of one<br>
person (no offense Damien) that determines who gets to participate and who doesn't.  I<br>
don't see Max More, Dan Clemmensen or Daniel Fabulich on the list - all of whom have had<br>
substantial influences on my own thinking.<br>
<p>
However with a big "Sigh", I have yet to determine a more sustainable way to maintaining<br>
a high S/N other than the way Damien has approached it.  Anybody know of alternatives?<br>
<p>
I think the most thanks should go to Anders, who despite his high caliber has<br>
perseveringly continued a high level of discussion on *all* of the lists - at least I<br>
*can* interact with him w/o resorting to private correspondence.<br>
