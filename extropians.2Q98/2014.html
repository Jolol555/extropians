Cultural blaster Camilla Paglia once questioned the literary disappearance<br>
of Susan Sontag.  By doing so, she arouses an all-out search for Sontag's<br>
writings. Susan Sontag's books _Styles of Radical Will_ and _Against<br>
Interpretation_ are (like Paglia) a collection of quick witted essays not<br>
only for their style but for content about culture.<br>
<p>
[Camilla Paglia is a mentor for me.  I love her intelligent outspoken stand<br>
on many issues, especially feminism and education.  Although she is a<br>
self-professed libertarian, she seldom brings her politics into her essays<br>
outright, but states her views on important issues in such a way that her<br>
ideas ring louder than political phrasings.]<br>
<p>
It wasn't difficult to pick up on what seems to be an unconscious lead by<br>
Paglia that Sontag was her original mentor until Sontag denounced her<br>
affiliation with Pop Culture (referenced in _Vamps and Tramps_).   Paglia<br>
saw this as a literary and professional blunder for Sontag.  Regardless of<br>
faux pas or not, I took this lead and decided to explore Sontag more<br>
carefully.  Vroom!  Glad I did!<br>
<p>
Sontag writes, in part, about culture and art. In the essay, "The<br>
Aesthetics of Silence," she questions the artists' metaphoric silence.  If<br>
the artist chooses to be "silent," if he chooses to make art that is<br>
confusing to the audience, then she is actually silencing art by making it<br>
uncommunicative and unobtainable.  If the artist creates a vocabulary that<br>
is so difficult for the audience to read or understand, then he is<br>
silencing art. <br>
<p>
Another essay, "One culture and the new sensibility," focuses on the two<br>
cultures of art and science (my favorite subject -:), questions C.P. Snows<br>
assumptions (right on!) and heads into the ever changing new standards and<br>
new attitudes toward pleasure.  For her, high and low as slogans for art<br>
are less and less meaningful and talks about interest in "sensory mixes."<br>
<p>
If  Sontag had made it through the ridicule of her initial support of Pop<br>
Culture unscathed, and if she were still around, would she write - as a<br>
controversial critic- about our transhuman culture with a wide-eyed view?<br>
If she could make even coffee nervous - she could delve into transhumanity<br>
with an inquisitive mind.<br>
<p>
"None of us can ever retrieve that innocence before all theory when art<br>
knew no need to justify itself, when one did not ask of a work of art what<br>
is said because one know (or thought one knew) what it did.  From now to<br>
the end of consciousness, we are stuck with the task of defending art."<br>
