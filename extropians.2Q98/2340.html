"Chemical computer" key to future technology? <br>
June 11, 1998 08:22 PM <br>
By Michael Kahn <br>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - A supercomputer using factory-reject chips and<br>
having more than 220,000 defects, each deadly enough to disable any other<br>
machine, could be the forerunner of "chemical computers" that are faster,<br>
cheaper and more powerful, researchers said on Thursday. <br>
The Teramac computer could offer engineers a way to build computers chemically<br>
-- something necessary for innovation in the field to continue, they said in a<br>
report published in the journal Science. <br>
"This is another path to hopefully continue the computer revolution," said<br>
Philip Kuekes, a computer architect at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories HWP in<br>
California, who helped build Teramac. <br>
Teramac's defect tolerance made the researchers realize they could<br>
theoretically build smaller computers using chemistry. <br>
"Chemistry allows you to build very small things on an atomic scale even if<br>
they aren't perfect," Kuekes said in a telephone interview. "We believe we can<br>
build smaller-sized computer circuits using chemical reactions." <br>
He explained current silicon technology, which uses light to produce chips,<br>
has<br>
limitations. When wavelengths become too short they turn into X-rays and<br>
damage<br>
molecules, Kuekes said. <br>
"We can't keep going in that direction because we will eventually destroy what<br>
we are trying to build," he said. <br>
But making components chemically allows computer builders to shrink the<br>
size of<br>
circuits. This means faster machines, Kuekes said. <br>
"The signals don't have as far to go and are much faster," Kuekes said. <br>
Teramac, for example, has more connections than normal computers and for<br>
certain applications was 100 times faster than Hewlett-Packard's top<br>
workstation, Kuekes pointed out. <br>
The computer was able to disregard the flaws because its makers set up the<br>
wires and connections in a way similar to a series of city streets with no<br>
dead<br>
ends. This let Teramac route around defects by choosing a different pathway,<br>
Kuekes said. <br>
"The computer solution found a solution that avoided the defect and worked<br>
around them," Kuekes said. <br>
Using chemistry to make defect-tolerant computers will also help lower the<br>
skyrocketing costs it takes to manufacture the chips needed to run computers,<br>
the researchers said. <br>
"Today computer (chips) have to be perfect. The significance is it will drop<br>
the cost if they don't have to be," Kuekes said. <br>
A large part of the expense in manufacturing microprocessors today is the<br>
multibillion-dollar plants, where the cost of making perfect devices requires<br>
increasing cleanliness and precision, he added. <br>
But with defect-tolerant computers these plants are unnecessary because the<br>
chips need not be perfect. <br>
"As perfect devices become more expensive to fabricate, defect-tolerance<br>
becomes a more valuable method to deal with imperfections," the authors<br>
wrote. <br>
Jim Heath, a chemist at the University of California Los Angeles, said<br>
building<br>
a computer chemically lets researchers design computers that exceed the<br>
limitations of silicon-chip technology. <br>
"Theoretically computers can be much more efficient ... but you're not<br>
going to<br>
do it with silicon technology," said Heath, who worked on the study. <br>
While, actually constructing a computer in a chemical lab is at least 10 years<br>
away Teramac shows it is now feasible, Heath said in a telephone interview. <br>
"It suddenly gives people in the field a goal," he said. REUTERS <br>
