<i>&gt;Can we really put a definite definition to the word truth?</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: Physical reality. Concepts, ideas, and<br>
  claims that are true are those that map onto<br>
  the physical reality as a one-one function.<br>
  Beyond the physical reality, a true claim <br>
  is one that follows logically from a given<br>
  set of axioms and such claims are true only <br>
  to the extent they adhere to those axioms<br>
  and may not be true outside those axioms.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;1. truth is in the eye of the beholder</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: Physics equations can predict physical<br>
  outcomes with little or no room for doubt.<br>
  That Newton's law of gravity F = GmM/r^2<br>
  defines gravity and allows up to predict <br>
  its effects under various conditions is<br>
  a truth NOT "in the eye of the beholder." <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  2. bias truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;     a. hitler is viewed as evil by the majority for ordering the </i><br>
<i>&gt;death of millions,  yet Einstien is viewed as good when in actuality </i><br>
<i>&gt;he killed millions more than hitler</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I doubt that that maps onto the physical <br>
   reality since I don't think that the A-bombs<br>
   killed millions, or that Einstein can be said<br>
   to be fully responsible. Mutual assured de-<br>
   struction may have even saved millions.<br>
<p>
   If those claims about reality do not map onto<br>
   the physical reality, then they are not true.<br>
   They very fact that you cite them means that <br>
   your relying on some standard of truth to <br>
   argue that there is no standard of truth!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;     b. Columbus discovered America, usually discovery is of the unknown</i><br>
(America was already known, and inhabited) and he never saw <br>
<i>&gt;America</i><br>
<p>
   IAN: So it does not map onto the phsyical reality.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;3. my truth is not necessarily your truth, and yours not mine</i><br>
<p>
   IAN: You mean that you can override gravity?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;4. truth is only a test of you collected knowledge, there fore the </i><br>
<i>&gt;more knowledge the more truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. all truth has the option of being bias</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    IAN: No argument here invalidates the definition<br>
    of truth as the physical reality I just proposed.<br>
