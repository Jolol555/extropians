I've never heard of a gang without a leader.  I'm not sure it's<br>
possible, even consensus among the gang members would mean giving up a<br>
degree of power.  If an organisation could be formed within this<br>
situation it is likely to be short-lived and highly unstable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A stable anarchy would indeed make each</i><br>

<i>&gt; else's very small area except by mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; consent.  That doesn't create the</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation of multiple governments over</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same area.</i><br>
<p>
The original idea of anarchy is to give all individuals the ability to<br>
pursue their own freedom.  A freedom dictated only by other like<br>
individuals (the reason why "traditional" anarchists are against large<br>
corporations and establishments.)  Once you start using restriction<br>
and consensus to achieve this goal you loose the original intent.  The<br>
truth is, although we can talk about how anarchy might occur (and try<br>
to encourage those elements involved), forcing it to do so is a<br>
complete contradiction to its very nature.<br>
<p>
But we are in agreement on one fact - all individuals must fill the<br>
power vacuum.  The only way this can occur is through more powerful<br>
and ubiquitous technologies of 'control.'  The definition of 'control'<br>
has becoming ubiquitous communication (broadcast.)  The original<br>
ideology of the Internet was to give all users the power to create,<br>
distribute, and use information in an attempt to decentralise the<br>
power of the media.  Without a doubt continuing this trend would be<br>
advantageous to all individuals (especially me.)  And don't be fooled<br>
by the consumer-capitalist front-end that's been tacked on to the<br>
Internet recently, it's just there to fund it's own demise.<br>

Without private property *all* you get is large-scale co-operation.<br>
