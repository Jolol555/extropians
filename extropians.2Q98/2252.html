Many people will find transhumanism just distasteful. Why? The Christian<br>
philosophy is based on the supernatural and death. "Jesus died for our<br>
sins." "When you die, you go to Heaven." "Satan is in hell, the after<br>
world of those who choose to not be with God." <br>
<p>
Transhumanism is just not compatible with the Christian viewpoint. Many<br>
Christians I have talk too feel that transhumanist memes are the closest<br>
thing they have ever heard to "satanism" they heard. Living forever is<br>
considered to be a great evil to most Christians.<br>
<p>
If you go to your local bookstore, I dare you to find more than 10 books<br>
on HUMANISM. Then look for how many books were on religion (way over<br>
100) and probably just as many on the "new age" movement. Few books on<br>
reason, science, humanism, or transhumanism, when looking at the grand<br>
total of the books there. Why? Bookstores sell what people buy. <br>
