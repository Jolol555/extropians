<i>&gt;&gt;   Your definition is new and IS properly defined</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;   in a holist context by adding "with respect to."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   You're REdefining the standard then you're </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   portraying the standard as my definition that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   is totally my own and is unlike what most </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   people use. That is the opposite of the truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You assert, then, that most people use YOUR definition and not mine?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: "My definition" of atomism is the Three <br>
   Law of Thought. The Three Laws of Thought are <br>
   not properly defined as "Ian's definition." If <br>
   you want to give me the credit for inventing <br>
   the 3 Laws, that's nice, but not appropriate.<br>
<p>
   I assert that your addition of "with respect <br>
   to 0" is YOUR definition of atomism (consistent<br>
   with my defintion of holism) and that it is, as <br>
   you acknowledge, the same as saying "atomism = <br>
   holism." When I counter atomism I counter the <br>
   traditional definition of atomism that would <br>
   say that "atomism =/= holism."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   The 3 Laws define a crisp boundary around A</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   that says the identity of A is exclusive to A</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   by 100%. Adding to A is A "with respect to 0"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   turns atomism into a holistic relation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, let me get this straight:  The 3 Laws are the right definition, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;therefore my definition is wrong. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: The Three Laws express atomism <br>
   by 100%. Your definition does not.<br>
   It is holistic only in that it is <br>
   not outside a whole set, but it <br>
   defines an A that exists not.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;sigh&gt; It's hopeless, Ian.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   That such relation is the truth does not mean it </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   is atomism. You've assumed "atomism" = "truth."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No.  I'm simply asserting what most everyone ELSE knew already: that all</i><br>
<i>&gt;"atomist" Newtonians agree that nothing is defined without a frame of</i><br>
<i>&gt;reference, but that within a frame of reference, properties can vary</i><br>
<i>&gt;independently.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: That idea of independent variance is atomism.<br>
  If we take it to the 100% extreme, A is A free from<br>
  any frame of reference. An example of a variation<br>
  occurring free from other features in a frame of <br>
  reference is a "free variation" only relative to <br>
  the whole, and does not measure a degree of atomism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   That you attempt to show examples of relations </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   that are what they are free from other relations,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   means your saying that relation-A is A free from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   -A, and thus you still deploy the very traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   atomist definition that you seek to redefine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hardly.  To rephrase it in terms of holism, using the partial difference</i><br>
<i>&gt;between A-0 and B-0 allows us to derive the rest of the identity chart; we</i><br>
<i>&gt;lose no information by describing identity in terms of this relation.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: There is no "partial difference." <br>
   There is omission of the full difference.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;A is NOT free from not-A.  You can't have an A free from at least one</i><br>
<i>&gt;other thing: in this case, 0.  However, you can have A free from B, if we</i><br>
<i>&gt;define identity as the relation between A and 0.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: B adds attributes to A, each attribute<br>
   expressing their holistic identity union.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: Then 1 also has no identity because </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    there is no difference between 1 and 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not unless you're defining your universe with respect to 1.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    IAN: 1 - 1 = 0, so there is <br>
    no difference between 1 and 1.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: A may be larger, faster,... than B, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    and yes, all with respect to 0. Just observe</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    that 3 is 5 relative to -2 and we see that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    non-zero identities acquire identity attributes</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    from non-zero identities... as well as from 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Consider thinking of it this way:  When we say that 3 is 5 relative to -2,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that means that we are saying that -2 is 0 relative to -2.  So the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that 3 is 5 relative to -2 does not mean that 3 has an identity which</i><br>
<i>&gt;comes from -2, but that 3 has an identity which comes from zero; when we</i><br>
<i>&gt;change reference frames, -2 is the 0.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Yes, every point is also a relative <br>
  0 point, which shows how "A to 0" is a<br>
  relation that applies to A/0, B/0 and A/B.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: But half is not free from the whole,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    and the cause of the half is the whole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So?  A can change relative to 0 independently from B relative to 0, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that's all I'm trying to prove.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: If A = 3 and B = 6 and A changes<br>
  from 3 to 9, A has changed relative <br>
  to both 0 and B. The relation 0/6 is<br>
  many things from many points of view.<br>
  It is large from 0/.03, it is tiny <br>
  from 0/103067472. When we include more <br>
  into our frame of reference we redefine<br>
  the nature of the 0/6 relation. To say <br>
  that the 0/6 relation remains static is <br>
  to negate its relation to anything else.<br>
