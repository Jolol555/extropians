In Japan, 'love detectors' mean mate is just a bleep away <br>

TOKYO (May 15, 1998 08:26 a.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) - When would-be<br>
lovers in Japan meet that special someone these days, they can truly say<br>
bells have rung.<br>
<p>
Or, more properly, bleeped.<br>
<p>
A love detector that bleeps when the chance of romance comes near has taken<br>
the Japanese market by storm, ringing up sales unseen since a distant<br>
cousin, the "Tamagotchi," burst on the scene two years ago.<br>
<p>
But while the Tamagotchi -- an electronic virtual pet that has to be "fed"<br>
and "cleaned" by punching buttons -- was about platonic care, the<br>
"Lovegety" is about love, love, love.<br>
<p>
The egg-shaped device comes in male and female versions. One has a blue<br>
underside and the other pink, and they are small enough to fit in a hand.<br>
<p>
Owners can set the device to show display lights according to whether they<br>
are in the mood for a simple chat, ready to sing karaoke, or want to go all<br>
the way up to the "Get2" mode, in which anything the couple wants goes.<br>
<p>
When a male Lovegety and a female Lovegety come within 4.5 meters (15 feet)<br>
of each other, a high-pitched bleeper goes off, alerting the owners to a<br>
possible rendezvous.<br>
<p>
Neither responds to the same sex.<br>
<p>
Once a hopeful couple has homed in on each other, a delicate social ritual<br>
ensues as they size each other up and, if mutually agreeable, try to match<br>
Lovegety program modes. When harmony reigns, the machines flash green.<br>
<p>
"Men wanting to meet women, and women wanting to meet men - it's a<br>
universal theme, and this toy is here to make the whole process easier,<br>
less embarrassing," said Takeya Takafuji, at the Tokyo branch of Erfolg,<br>
the firm that makes them.<br>
<p>
The devices are certainly proving an attraction for reserved Japanese.<br>
Priced at 2,900 yen - around $25 - some 350,000 have been sold since they<br>
hit the stores this February.<br>
<p>
Men have bought more than half, said Takafuji, because "Japanese men are<br>
very shy."<br>
<p>
The birth of Lovegety came when an insurance salesman friend of Takafuji's<br>
said it would be nice to have a gadget that let people meet painlessly and<br>
understand each other's feelings in a flash.<br>
<p>
Takafuji took the idea to the president of Erfolg -- "success" in German --<br>
and after a year of development, Lovegety was ready to strut its stuff.<br>
<p>
Lovegety's runaway success was a shock that has given a massive shot in the<br>
arm to the six-year-old company, which was originally a manufacturer of<br>
modems and producer of Internet pages.<br>
<p>
Takafuji said the huge success last year of Bandai Co Ltd's Tamagotchi<br>
paved the way for the Lovegety.<br>
<p>
She said the company hopes to sell three million of the love machines.<br>
<p>
Plans are also afoot for a deluxe model by which prospective lovers can<br>
talk to each other at a distance of 100 meters (yards).<br>
<p>
The company plans to start sales of the device in Britain in several months<br>
and is also talking with distributors in Hong Kong.<br>
<p>
Many happy relationships have already resulted from use of the Lovegety,<br>
Takafuji said, although nobody appears to have tied the knot yet.<br>
<p>
"But I personally know of at least 10 couples, so there is always hope."<br>
