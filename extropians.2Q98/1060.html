OK, so I was wrong.  :)<br>
<p>
In my last post on this topic, I said:  "so long as some work is necessary<br>
to feed a person, work will never go away; we should struggle to make this<br>
work as inconsequential as possible, but it will never be zero."  Sorry,<br>
Tony Belding.<br>
<p>
I've come to the conclusion that this is wrong.  We CAN all get fed without<br>
doing work, and automation is the way to do it.  Here's how.<br>
<p>
In contrast to Marx's "labor theory of value," I think modern economics is<br>
a kind of a "capital theory of value," which presumes that all wealth in<br>
some way, shape, or form, stems from capital.  In this sense, we understand<br>
the work done by a laborer as comparable to the wealth created by a<br>
capitalist.  The only difference is this:  where the capitalist uses<br>
material capital to create wealth, the laborer creates wealth using their<br>
"human capital."  Wages can be thought of as the price of human capital.<br>
<p>
Why is this relevant?  Because this means that it is wrong headed to say<br>
that "work" must always be done.  Wealth must be exchanged for wealth, but<br>
wealth comes from CAPITAL, not work.  And human-owned capital may one day<br>
be just as effective at creating wealth as human capital is today.<br>
<p>
So, for example, suppose a new form of robot arm were able to do your job<br>
for you, faster and more cheaply than you could.  That's capital creating<br>
wealth.  Now suppose that robot arm were cybernetically grafted onto your<br>
body.  (This is the example which led me to this change of mind.)<br>
Suddenly, any work that this arm would do would be YOUR work; it would be<br>
*you* doing the job and your human capital creating the wealth.<br>
Alternately, imagine being a worker in a factory around the turn of the<br>
20th century, and then somehow removing your hands and arms from your body<br>
and leaving them there, while you went off to play games.  [Soccer,<br>
presumably. ;)]  You would need to do no work at all: your arms and hands<br>
would create all the wealth you needed to survive.<br>
<p>
- From this perspective, it is clearly possible for someone to own capital<br>
that creates so much wealth that they don't have to use any of their human<br>
capital at all.  Indeed, this has been the historical argument AGAINST<br>
capitalists: they don't make as much use of their human capital, which<br>
Marxists considered the only source of value.<br>
<p>
Automation represents an increase in the return on material capital<br>
relative to the return on human capital, thus lowering the demand for human<br>
capital.  However, as noted, so long as wages and prices are fully<br>
flexible, these lower wages will be able to buy more goods, thus helping to<br>
make certain that workers won't starve as a result of this decreased demand<br>
for labor.<br>
<p>
In the long run, however, the solution to this problem is cheap privately<br>
owned capital, with as high a rate of return as possible.  The perfect<br>
extreme example of this would the "anything box:" the anything box can<br>
create anything, including another anything box, for free.  This is<br>
obviously unrealistic, but since there are some people who don't have to go<br>
to work in order to get fed, it is clear that capital of this scale could<br>
eventually be affordable to everyone.  And as prices drop and innovation<br>
continues, we should see technology moving closer and closer to our ideal.<br>
<p>
HOWEVER, I still maintain that having lots of sentient robots around would<br>
be good for us too.  We don't have to make an either-or decision here.  We<br>
can use BOTH, reaping the benefits of automation AND the benefits of a<br>
larger population all in one fell swoop.  The sentient robots can use the<br>
non-sentient robots just as well as we can, if not better.  So not only<br>
will we have the added benefit of increased productivity from automation,<br>
we'll ALSO have the benefit of an increased population; the only difference<br>
being that one portion of the population happens to be sentient robots.<br>
<p>
Sorry if this didn't make much sense, I wrote this in a fit of "eureka" (or<br>
perhaps "d'oh!") at around 1 AM.  :)<br>
