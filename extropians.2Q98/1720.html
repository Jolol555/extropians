<i>&gt; have to work together somehow to develop some kind of GAAP with this idea</i><br>

<i>&gt; micropayments for resource handling would do the trick.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I think there are free market incentives for organizations accounting<br>
for their waste.  That incentive is efficiency and financial gain.  Kevin Kelly<br>
pointed out in his book 'Out of Control", the idea of  industrial ecology parks<br>
where one companies waste is used by another as raw material in their<br>
manufacturing process.  Right now, most companies spend large sums of money either<br>
disposing of their waste within the strictures of the EPA, recycle, or dump it<br>
illegally.  Not only is the waste itself, a marker of the manufacturers<br>
inefficiency, but a costly liability in today's stricter environmental policy.<br>
<p>
In collaboration with a nearby cement plant that happened to be owned by its<br>
parent company Texas Industries Inc., Chaparral set out to find new opportunities<br>
reduce waste generation, increase efficiency and create value. The results have<br>
been noteworthy. Chaparral has reduced the volume of baghouse dust (a hazardous<br>
waste which costs<br>
$220 ton to dispose of) to 28% below industry average, reduced lime content in the<br>
dust by 87% (allowing it to be used in metals recovery), reduced lime use by<br>
one-third and saved over $1 million in 1994 by using 5130 tons of recycled dust in<br>
the furnace.<br>
<p>
In 1993 Chaparral improved magnetic separation of slag, (which it had previously<br>
sold as a road-building material for $0.55/ton), recycling iron back to the<br>
furnace and selling the resulting higher grade, low iron slag to the cement plant<br>
at $22/ton. Added revenue, $6 million. Chaparral has replaced hazardous mill<br>
cleaning solvents: non-organic caustic, halogenated organic and ignitable organic<br>
with non-toxic products, and reduced solvent use overall by 160 tons/year, for an<br>
annual savings of $400,000. And closed loop processes have enabled Chaparral to<br>
cut make-upwater consumption in half.<br>
<p>
The only limitation of this idea so far has been geographic proximity. The<br>
internet can alleviate this problem by allowing otherwise geographically remote<br>
industries to start selling their waste products to companies who could use the<br>
raw materials found within it.  Even if companies gave their waste away, it would<br>
be much cheaper than the money they now spend on disposal logistics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the case of space tech, the astonishing number of serious private launching</i><br>
<i>&gt; ventures seem very likely to yield impressive advances in LEO and translunar</i><br>
<i>&gt; development before 2010; yet much of this development is not widely known</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside of the space industry and its ancillary cloud of enthusiasts.</i><br>
<p>
By advancements here I'm assuming you mean cheaper access to space.  What kind of<br>
$/kg costs are we looking at with these private ventures?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2005 - 2015</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Space:</i><br>
<p>
I think the development of space during this period, assuming we still don't have<br>
nanotech, will hinge largely on $/kg access costs to LEO.  Assuming we can get<br>
costs down below $100/kg, the long-term payoff vs the initial costs of development<br>
will spur major private industry into space.   For many applications Teledesic<br>
will probably be replaced by much larger and more stable geostationary satellites<br>
offering enhanced and comprehensive global telecommunication services.  Near-Earth<br>
asteroid capture will become big business as the cost of capturing such objects<br>
will pale in comparison to the costs of transporting the same materials off<br>
Earth.  This in turn will facilitate major improvements in space-based<br>
manufacturing, CELSS, space medicine, human-habitation-ergonomics.<br>
<p>
Obviously, once nanoengineered materials arrive on the scene, such space<br>
development will accelerate dramatically.<br>
