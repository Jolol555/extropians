<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;THEN it might be considered improper to own them.  That would be slavery. </i><br>
<i>&gt;They would have to be set free and be paid for their work.  (Why do you call</i><br>
<i>&gt;them FREE if you have to PAY them?  No, don't answer that!)  Under these</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumstances, the robots change from being *servants* of humanity to being</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitors.  Instead of finally lifting the burden of WORK from our</i><br>
<i>&gt;civilization, the robots would simply take our jobs and leave us with</i><br>
nothing.<br>
<p>
When I pay you for your labor, we BOTH benefit: I for receiving your labor,<br>
you for receiving my payment.  Robots would be no different.  The argument<br>
that anyone could do our work and leave us WORSE off as a result is dubious<br>
at best.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are four basic economic resources: land, labor, capital, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;entrepreneurial ability.  I see the coming era as a change from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;labor-oriented economy to a capital-oriented economy.  This change has</i><br>
already<br>
<i>&gt;started, it happens whenever workers are replaced by machines.  The ultimate</i><br>
<i>&gt;goal should be for *all* workers to be replaced by machines, and all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;former workers become capitalists -- owners of the machines.  But if we grant</i><br>
<i>&gt;that sufficiently advanced machines might also be /people/, then it throws a</i><br>
<i>&gt;monkeywrench into the whole plan.</i><br>
<p>
If the robots ARE people, then we're right back to a labor oriented economy<br>
again, only with a different type of people doing the work.<br>
<p>
Try thinking about it this way:  each sentient robot we create is like<br>
giving birth to a new child.  Now, since people on average produce more<br>
than they consume, it has long been true that increasing population<br>
increases economic wealth per capita, and that successive generations have<br>
become increasingly productive.  The nations of the world, including the<br>
world's poor, have grown richer as a result.  The upshot of all this is<br>
that a labor market with lots of sentient robots is not only not bad, but<br>
may be the best thing that could possibly happen to us.<br>
<p>
With respect to ANIMAL rights...<br>
<p>
I've been uncertain about animal rights for a long time now.  I'm basically<br>
a utilitarian, and I support a libertarian conception of human rights<br>
because I believe that doing so will help to maximize human utility.  From<br>
the perspective of the human race, then, respecting the utility of animals<br>
(especially that derived from owning the property where they live) would<br>
cost us dearly with respect to our utility.<br>
<p>
However, this is not a valid argument for neglecting the utility of<br>
animals; it only shows that in doing so we would have to make certain<br>
unpalatable concessions.  This same argument could have been used by a<br>
slave owner to justify the economics of racial slavery.<br>
<p>
What I can say is this:  animals cannot and do not respect law, contract or<br>
the utility of other animals.  Some animals do respect the land of others<br>
or engage in "altruistic" behavior with respect to other animals, but<br>
others are carnivorous, aggressive and/or selfish to the point of killing<br>
others to achieve their ends.  We would not accept such behavior if it were<br>
a human doing so to others.<br>
<p>
Similarly, we cannot treat animals' transgressions of "animal rights" in<br>
the same way that we treat a human's.  In human society we can contract<br>
with someone not to destroy the animals, we can imprison them for not<br>
respecting animals' homes, we can educate them as to why this may not be in<br>
their self interest.  We cannot even begin to hope to do this sort of thing<br>
to other species.  Animals cannot understand a contract, nor would they<br>
understand the nature of imprisonment and would not therefore adjust their<br>
strategies on a game-theoretical payoff grid.  Carnivores, with few<br>
exceptions, cannot be taught vegetarianism.<br>
<p>
For the reasons I have described, I cannot use the utilitarian argument to<br>
support a libertarian conception of rights; even if the animal would<br>
benefit from my respecting its rights, it would not and could not respect<br>
mine.  Thusly, at least for now, I reject the argument for animal rights.<br>
