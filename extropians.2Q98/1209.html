Granted you can look at "true" in the sense of a scientific truth i.e.<br>
"this complies with 100% of our observations at present time."  But I<br>
was opposing scientific "truth" presented as a competing against<br>
religious truth.  The popular definition of "truth" is that which is<br>
unquestionable - clearly this is not scientific.  So if religion and<br>
science have very different ideas about what is true and what is<br>
false, using science to prove religion to be false is an entirely<br>
pointless exercise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Pseudoscience would simply be the absence of knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
Much pseudo-science comes from presenting the result of scientific<br>
knowledge to those without that knowledge.  That result is generally<br>
information (i.e. the information "time travel is possible" can lead<br>
to really bad Star Trek plots without the writers "knowing" that time<br>
travel is possible).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I disagree.  I also am not convinced that knowledge =&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; constant increase. A person could have a fixed set of </i><br>
<i>&gt; things they know, and it does not spontaneously repl-</i><br>
<i>&gt; icate into more knowledge. The set of all raccoons</i><br>
<i>&gt; have probably maintained a pretty constant level</i><br>
<i>&gt; of knowledge. I think true and a false are </i><br>
<i>&gt; attributes of knowledge, growth is not.</i><br>
<p>
Not spontaneous growth, but the ability for growth.  Information that<br>
leads to nothing is clearly not knowledge.  "Knowing" something<br>
implies a level of understanding, but the term "know" is used more<br>
generally to mean "remember" without understanding.  I'll agree that<br>
"true" and "false" can be attributes of knowledge (in the specific<br>
scientific sense outlined above).  But "true" is not an absolute and<br>
it's important to be careful of how you use terms such as "true" and<br>
"false" because they are presumed an absolute by both religious groups<br>
and some scientists.  However, I still think that science does not<br>
seek truth in either sense.  When faced with an observational truth (a<br>
theory that complies with 100% of evidence so far) science will still<br>
consider alternatives (which your definition would consider false)<br>
even before evidence suggests the current truth is false.  Also,<br>
science routinely uses theory that has been proven "false" by<br>
evidence.  So science is far fuzzier than simple truths.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Knowledge growth is an attribute of desire to</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn and of the mental capacity to do so.</i><br>
<p>
If you have no desire or mental capacity to use (and therefore<br>
understand) the information you're given, then do you "know" it? <br>
Remember that I said, "knowledge creates more knowledge and/or<br>
information" if it only creates information then it is not "growing"<br>
as such.  Information can come from implementing knowledge in the real<br>
world (i.e. I know how to build a car, I build a car, there is a car)<br>
as well as simply creating a mental model.<br>
