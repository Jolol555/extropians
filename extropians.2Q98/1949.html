<i>&gt; The pursuit of greatness, perhaps.  To me, this is one thing that</i><br>
separates<br>

out,<br>
<i>&gt; animals can suffer just like humans, and animals can also be happy. </i><br>
But, they<br>
<i>&gt; can't achieve greatness.</i><br>
<p>
This seems like a rather biased &amp; unsubstantiated opinion. Naturally,<br>
we feel that the accomplishments of humans are significant compared to<br>
other organisms, and we certainly do build bigger structures. OTOH, I<br>
could change it into "animals procreate, and some may achieve pleasure<br>
from doing so, but only human females are truly attractive."<br>
And, who knows, a beaver, after utting the finishing touches on his<br>
dam, might think to himself "now that is one GREAT dam!"<br>
[not that I think that beavers think that way, only that we have no<br>
way of knowing]<br>
<p>
I think, in order to process this, I would need to have some sort of<br>
ballpark definition of "greatness"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Pharaoh Khufu created the Great Pyramid at Giza.  Presumably it</i><br>
made him<br>
<i>&gt; happy to create pyramids.  Now Khufu is long dead, and he is</i><br>
therefore no<br>
<i>&gt; longer happy, but his pyramid is STILL GREAT.  He changed the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The Great Pyramid is sometimes atributed to Khufu on the flimsiest of<br>
evidence; there is considerable debate on this point.<br>
Would Khufu still be great if he had nothing to do with it?<br>
Is the fellow who actually built it (hypothetically) but never<br>
recognized for his achievement great?<br>
<p>
What if Homer turned out to be several people- or several thousand<br>
storytellers who each added a piece over time? Would they all be Great?<br>
Is Achilles Great?<br>
[or, Achilles is great if he existed. if he didnt, then Homer is great<br>
for inventing him, or if what is attributed to Homer is in fact the<br>
work of many men, all of whom are great.]<br>
And what if I think that the pyramids are just a bunch of big rocks,<br>
or that the Illiad sucks- does that mean that they arent great *to me*?<br>
<p>
[BTW- saw an excellent documentary on Discover the other night on how<br>
weathering patterns on the Sphinx indicate that it has undergone<br>
considerable weathering from rain- and it hasnt rained heavily ont he<br>
Giza plateau since 6000BC, indicating that the Sphinx may be 8-10,000<br>
years old]<br>
<p>

<p>
PS Not that I disagree, actually. It seems to me that something<br>
divides men from animals- but I prefer to think of it as internal. If<br>
Khufu strove against the world to achieve something, then that is my<br>
idea of greatness- succeed or fail, even if his work doesnt outlast<br>
him physically. Or maybe we agree on this?<br>
