Yes, porting and emulation from raw voxel data scans seems far enough<br>
from current tech.  However, Destructive scans that output raw voxel<br>
data at needed fidelity is almost possible now (and almost affordable<br>
if you are B. Gates).  Of course, the only thing gained over cryonics<br>
is room temperature and multiple location backup storage.  Also, with<br>
good compression, possibly much less real estate will be needed. <br>
Mabey 100 people in a box of "Super Ultra DVD XXXIV" ROMs or<br>
something. Room temperature storage means no maintenance and that with<br>
the multiple backup storage locations gives enough advantages to<br>
destroy cryonics.  Although all of cryonics technology will be needed<br>
in the scanning procedure.  So I don't want to sound like I don't<br>
appreciate the work in this area.<br>
I also see a good possibility for non-destructive scans in this time<br>
frame.  Possibly using a technology mentioned on this list before.  A<br>
light source is pulsed on one side of the head and only the photons<br>
that made it through without any collisions are recorded on the other<br>
side.  The head is slightly rotated and this is repeated 360 degrees. <br>
Since most of your head is empty space (at least mine is) the<br>
non-empty space is recorded per voxel.<br>
<p>
Since I've gone from being conservative on my first point to being<br>
speculative on my second, I may as well step out there on the fringe<br>
for my third.<br>
There has been some recent discussion about traveling into the past on<br>
this list.  I've always been more interested in the possibility of a<br>
"peering into the past technology" (PIP Tech) rather than actually<br>
traveling into the past.  I define  PIP Tech as the ability to peer<br>
into the past focusing on known coordinates at a specified past time<br>
with the ability to scan a biological brain with near molecular<br>
resolution.  I do not see PIP Tech as having some of the paradox and<br>
contradiction problems associated with time travel.  Although the<br>
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle causes some concern.   I just want to<br>
throw this long shot idea out for the space time engineering types to<br>
consider because it is obviously outside of my area of expertise. The<br>
idea of using a black hole as a lens into the past by re-mapping the<br>
distorted star field would not work here because I don't think you<br>
could use the nearest existing black hole to peer through our<br>
atmosphere at that resolution.  But what if we had a similar machine<br>
to the light pulsing and rotating one described above pointed to the<br>
nearest black hole.  Such a machine could be built cheap with todays<br>
tech because the difficult part is receiving only the photons in that<br>
very short window that underwent no collisions.  And that part would<br>
be accomplished by the future machine.  This is just one possible path<br>
to (machine in the present) assisted PIP Tech.  That is, we build a<br>
machine now in anticipation of assisting a future machine to peer into<br>
the past.  I really have no sound working theory for PIP Tech.  The<br>
above example was just to get the idea across so the space time<br>
engineering types could ponder the idea.  But I cannot dismiss it<br>
because of the immediate grand impact it would have.  The present<br>
machine along with a sound theory for the future machine(as opposed to<br>
a working model)would have an immediate impact.  Thats a first.  We<br>
use a sound theory for a future machine to get immediate results<br>
before building that machine.  If nothing else, I guess this could<br>
make for some interesting sci-fi.<br>
