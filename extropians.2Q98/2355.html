  IAN: I understand what you. But the photon <br>
  reaches you at the same instant it was emitted<br>
  because that instant travels at 186,000 mps.<br>
<p>
  Your "instant" is the same across the universe.<br>
  If we say that right now a photon is emitted<br>
  from a point 20 ly away, we are applying a "now"<br>
  that is uniform across the universe, and which<br>
  is universal time. If we say that the instant<br>
  travels with the photon, we say that when the <br>
  photon strikes us, the "now" of its emission<br>
  has reached us. Time travels at the SOL.<br>
