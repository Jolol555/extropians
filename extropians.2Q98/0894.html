Erik, <br>
<p>
I go on alert whenever anyone quotes a dictionary in this kind of <br>
context. Dictionaries are always behind -- they cannot capture all <br>
usages and they cannot be kept current. Words have connotations, and<br>
those connotations can not be ignored when convenient.<br>
<p>
Like it or not, "cult" is now a pejorative. If you don't want anyone<br>
to hear a pejorative tone, you will have to choose another word.<br>
<p>
If you meant to characterize extropianism as a secular religion, you<br>
could just say that. Perhaps for some people, extro-trans-humanism is<br>
a low-fat religious substitute (Religion Lite(tm)).<br>
<p>
This belongs in the FAQ if it's not there already, it's a hardy <br>
perennial. My take is that non-religious people use a lot of memes to <br>
fill the niches vacated by traditional religion, and there's nothing <br>
wrong with it, especially if they see it for what it is. There is of <br>
course a trap to fall into, of bringing over blind faith, misplaced <br>
zealotry, and other baggage from religious conditioning.<br>
