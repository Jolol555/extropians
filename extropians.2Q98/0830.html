Hi Natasha.<br>
<p>
I went back through the extropy archives to find the posts, and<br>
found Ian Goddard's example of Einstein's "travelling on a thought beam"<br>
experiment, which he is often quoted as having come up with as a 16 year<br>
old. Unfortunately, I have a high threshold for believing facts about<br>
Einstein, because there are so many popular urban legends (that he used to<br>
help a little girl with her homework, that he did poorly in school, and<br>
many others).<br>
<p>
I'll have a look through the biographies I have to see whether they<br>
mention the light beam example; perhaps Ian could comment on a primary<br>
source if he knows of one. It's certainly a very interesting idea! (I<br>
couldn't find any Einstein examples from Dan Clemmensen, although he did<br>
make an interesting post about the nature of creativity in general.<br>
Perhaps this is what you were referring too).<br>
<p>
I do remember that Einstein said (in a note to the mathematician Jacques<br>
Hadamard, who was trying to determine the origins of mathematical<br>
creativity) that his primary mode of thought was non-verbal. I thought<br>
this was especially interesting in connection with the problem of<br>
education, which is largely approached through verbal means.<br>
<p>
Einstein also wrote an essay in which he opined that an interest in<br>
epistemology was a characteristic shared by creative scientists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Inspiration comes from free association (spontaneous, logically</i><br>
<i>&gt; unconstrained and undirected association of ideas, emotions, and feelings),</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain storming, musing, day dreaming or pondering or reflections, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example.  </i><br>
<p>
One thing I find interesting about your list is that it contains two<br>
different types of sources for inspiration. One is the "idea fairy" who<br>
pops, unprompted, into your head on occasion. For me, that oftem means in<br>
the shower, or while out walking, often when some stress has been<br>
relieved. The other sources are more directed -- for example,<br>
one can deliberatiely "brainstorm", to come up with new ideas. This seems<br>
to be a much more directed form of creativity.<br>
<p>
One of my favourite authors is Edward de Bono, who has investigated and<br>
invented methods for enhancing an individual's creativity. Two of my<br>
favourite books by him are "Po: Beyond Yes and No", and "I am right, you<br>
are wrong". The latter, especially, synthesizes much of de Bono's 30 odd<br>
years work on the subject. Contains many good ideas for developing<br>
creativity.<br>
