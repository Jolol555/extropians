<p>
So, are you a mind rapist, too, Erik? You like to attack free markets which<br>
form a tremendously important part of some people's worldview. They might<br>
be very distressed if they lost their belief system under your barrage.<br>
Apparently you find it important enough to change their minds, since you<br>
keep working at it. <br>
<p>
Maybe Lee Daniel Crocker feels it is at least as important to change the<br>
minds of religious believers. After all, these are the people who attempt<br>
to kill us by forcing autopsies or burials on cryonics patients (that has<br>
happened), who try to and sometimes succeed in banning or slowing<br>
biomedical research, these are the people who made women suffer pain in<br>
childbearing because anaesthesia was against God's will, these are the<br>
people who try to control us according to their irrational beliefs and values.<br>
<p>
Personally, I don't feel the need to go around beating down people's<br>
beliefs. However, if someone shows interest, I do explore their views<br>
critically. I do this all the time in my Philosophy of Religion class.<br>
Could this lead to a breakdown in their worldview and considerable<br>
distress? Yes, it could. I went through that myself. It is difficult but<br>
that's how you grow. I don't think this is coercion. I would agree with you<br>
that it could reasonably be considered a form of coercion to push someone<br>
hard who really doesn't want to discuss their beliefs. But, after all, they<br>
only have to say "I don't wish to discuss this anymore" and walk away.<br>
Somehow, I don't see Lee Daniel Crocker tying up Christians and forcing<br>
them to listen to his atheistic views. (Or do you have a secret life like<br>
this Lee? :-) )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, just like I think I understand Catholicism better than the Pope.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Religous cults can usually not be correctly interpreted by their leaders,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unless those are perfectly aware of the fact that they are just brainwashing</i><br>
<i>&gt;a horde of money-bearing idiots. The intellectual level of Extropy is</i><br>
<i>&gt;higher, but nevertheless it is a cult and you are its leader.</i><br>
<p>
Those are fighting words. Put up or shut up. I'm tired of people like you<br>
casually throwing off statements like this without substantiation. That's a<br>
very serious charge, and I say you are lying. Unless you are using the term<br>
"cult" in such a loose sense that, say, Carl Sagan would be a cult leader<br>
for science or rationalism, you are wrong. <br>
<p>
Retract what you say, or else prove it. Otherwise I *will* have you removed<br>
from this list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;OK, I summarize: Extropian thinking must not be criticized on this mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt;list. Your fundamentals are built on sand, and that's why you cannot take</i><br>
<i>&gt;criticism. </i><br>
<p>
Criticism is fine, but this is not the place for it. The Transhuman list<br>
and many other places are available for that. I think the reason you cannot<br>
seem to grasp this simple point is that you don't want to. You would rather<br>
attack than understand. If you set up a list for the specific purpose of,<br>
say, discussing evolutionary theory in order to refine it and explore<br>
mechanisms by which it works, you would not be too pleased to have it<br>
invaded by creationists. It would waste your time and weaken the focus.<br>
That does not mean you would want to prevent creationists both having their<br>
own discussion lists, or joining in on lists intended to be open to that<br>
kind of debate.<br>
<p>
By violating the charter of this list, by your own standards, YOU ARE<br>
COERCING US. Stop it.<br>
