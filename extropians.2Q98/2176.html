  Nope, that's not it.  In QED, photons can travel faster or slower than <br>
  'c' in a full vacuum.  In the ballistic theory, the photons are emitted <br>
  and absorbed by the electrons of the transparent medium at 'c' relative <br>
  to the atoms in the medium.<br>
  <br>
    The 'gravitational slowing' you discuss is explained <br>
  by the ballistic theory of light in the ordinary classical-mechanical <br>
  way.  SR/GR have to assert that dimensionality is affected by gravity, <br>
  so that the photons are still travelling at 'c' but (somehow) space and <br>
  time are altered so this means they don't get very far.  I have never <br>
  seen a good explanation of this -- alleged -- process.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, this is not true. They travel at the same speed, with different wavelengths.</i><br>
<p>
         You completely miss the point.  The only reason to have red and <br>
         blue photons is to colour-differentiate them for ease of <br>
         explanation.  Northbound blue passes southbound blue at 2c.  <br>
         Northbound red passes southbound red at 2c.  The situational <br>
         logic is unbreakable.<br>
         <br>

<i>&gt; I'd like to see citations of mathematical treatments of black hole </i><br>
<i>&gt; theory that precedes SR/GR by 100 years. Lessee, that means they should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be published before 1805.</i><br>
<p>
     Black Holes are implicit in Newtonian gravitation with a ballistic <br>
     ('corpuscular') theory of light.  If the velocity of emission of <br>
     light-particles is less than the escape velocity of the emitting <br>
     body, the light-particle cannot escape the gravitational field and <br>
     will eventually fall back.<br>
     <br>
       The calculations are fairly simple.  Once we had Newton's <br>
     gravitational theory and &lt;inter alia&gt; Roehmer's measurement of <br>
     lightspeed by astronomical observation the calculation of the <br>
     Schwartzchild radius etc. is fairly easy.  Everything's a whole lot <br>
     simpler with ballistic theory, remember.  We've had great <br>
     mathematical tools for centuries.<br>
     <br>

<i>&gt; Solid state electronics cannot be described by</i><br>
<i>&gt; classical mechanics, because so much of electronic theory depends on </i><br>
<i>&gt; tunneling.</i><br>
<p>
    Funny, then, that we can model matter so accurately with classical <br>
    mechanics (Car-Parrinello Method) that we can _calculate_ (say) the <br>
    melting-point of silicon.  You have to get your head around the fact <br>
    that the same physical phenomena can be explained by indefinitely many <br>
    different theories, as Leibnitz showed.  The photo-electric effect <br>
    preceded Einstein &amp; Lenard's [1905].  Why do you think it's impossible <br>
    to come up with an auxilliary theory (even an ad hoc theory...) to <br>
    enable us to calculate tunnelling using classical mechanics?  All QM <br>
    is, is a statistically-based approximation method.<br>
    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Likewise,  lasers cannot function purely by classical mechanics.</i><br>
<p>
    Absolutely, they can (leaving aside the loose language).  The <br>
    mechanics of electron orbits, and of absorption and emission of <br>
    light-particles (photons) are all in my RM paper.  You simply don't <br>
    understand how far-reaching and powerful Classical Mechanics is as a <br>
    system.  What is it about lasers you think we can't explain?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nor can polarizing filters on cameras.</i><br>
<p>
   Simple: the light-particles spin (on up to 3 orthogonal axes).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the electroluminescent lamp cannot function by classical mechanics</i><br>
<p>
   A classical model of the atom (based on Bohr's baroque neo-classical <br>
   [1913] model) explains photon emission perfectly well -- RM explains it <br>
   even better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; nuclear fission cannot be described by classical mechanics.</i><br>
<p>
   Of course it can -- go look up 'packing fractions.'  All energy is <br>
   kinetic or potential.  Bound particles have potential energy.  Orbiting <br>
   particles have kinetic energy.<br>
   <br>
<i>&gt; the quantum tunneling microscope cannot function by classical mechanics.</i><br>
<p>
    Again, you're missing the point.  The effect is not dependent on the <br>
    theory.  And I asked for six examples relating to SR/GR, by the way, <br>
    not QM.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ok, thats six, now where is my money?</i><br>
<p>
  Not-OK!  Not six!  No cigar.  See above.<br>

PS: Sen. Pam Roach ('R', Auburn, WA) cited precisely your concealed-carry <br>
point, BTW).  This still does not endear her to me.<br>
