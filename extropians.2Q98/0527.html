<i> &gt; e$: Tet in Cypherspace</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Thursday, April 16, 1998</i><br>
<i> &gt; Boston, Massachusetts</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; So, it looks like the Clinton Administration, through its Commerce</i><br>
<i> &gt; Department, woke up this Blue Wednesday and smelled the coffee on the issue</i><br>
<i> &gt; of cryptographic prohibition.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; The fact that it happened on the day of the year when Uncle Fedster and his</i><br>
<i> &gt; minions formally celebrate their confiscation of almost 50% of our</i><br>
<i> &gt; collective income in federal, state and local taxes only made the victory</i><br>
<i> &gt; sweeter for those of us who think freedom still matters.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; It's too soon to count coup, here, because the crypto war's not over, but I</i><br>
<i> &gt; believe that the tide of this particular conflict has now officially turned.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Tet came on April 15th this year.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Think about it. We threw the "French" out of the cryptography market when</i><br>
<i> &gt; the NSA figured out that they could never control asymetric cryptographic</i><br>
<i> &gt; protocols in a world of freefalling semiconductor prices and ubiquitous</i><br>
<i> &gt; internetworking. Like the French did with USA 40 years ago in Indochina, the</i><br>
<i> &gt; NSA invited the FBI into a cryptographic "police action", to preserve</i><br>
<i> &gt; totalitarian statist colonialism in the guise of propping up the wiretap</i><br>
<i> &gt; domino.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; However, no matter how many editions of the 5 o'clock follies Mr. Freeh</i><br>
<i> &gt; held, no matter how many imaginary bodies he counted, he couldn't quite win</i><br>
<i> &gt; the hearts and minds of the internet, much less the American people.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; No amount of baleful hairy eyeballs cast in the general direction of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; crypto "advocacy" community could shut them up, certainly, but even more</i><br>
<i> &gt; important, it's the impending economic cost of Mr. Freeh's war that's</i><br>
<i> &gt; causing the implosion of his plans to see everything we do, or buy, in</i><br>
<i> &gt; "cypherspace", as Eric Hughes calls encrypted cyberspace.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; It's remarkable, really. It may even be better than the Tet offensive of</i><br>
<i> &gt; 1968. It might actually be as if everyone understood, at the time of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; Gulf of Tonkin resolution, that LBJ couldn't have the great society and the</i><br>
<i> &gt; Viet Nam war at the same time, that they had all read Milton Freedman's</i><br>
<i> &gt; monitarist papers somehow, and they could see in advance the devastating</i><br>
<i> &gt; inflation of the 1970's that LBJ would cause with our Viet Nam adventure.</i><br>
<i> &gt; The Gulf of Tonkin resolution fails. No war. More money for VISTA volunteers</i><br>
<i> &gt; or at least moonshots.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Actually, LBJ would have caused stagflation doing that "we owe it to</i><br>
<i> &gt; ourselves" stuff anyway, but it's a nice pipedream. Nonetheless, money is</i><br>
<i> &gt; always much more important than "policy". In spite of the most bloodthirsty</i><br>
<i> &gt; actions of the most totalitarian statist -- say, the late Pol Pot -- it's</i><br>
<i> &gt; money that creates law, and not the other way around.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; This presidency, more than any other in the history of this nation -- a</i><br>
<i> &gt; nation where political corruption has been celebrated as fine art --</i><br>
<i> &gt; understands this simple fact as a natural course of doing its lucretive</i><br>
<i> &gt; business. And the irony that the most socialist president in American</i><br>
<i> &gt; history is also the most attuned to income has never been lost on the people</i><br>
<i> &gt; he's trying to tax and regulate out of business.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; However, Freidrich Hayek has been proven right once again where the Clintons</i><br>
<i> &gt; have been concerned, though it's hard to figure out sometimes if Billary are</i><br>
<i> &gt; outright totalitarians themselves or just Hayak's "useful idiots" in the</i><br>
<i> &gt; now-dead cause of socialism. Fortunately, like any good parasites, Billary</i><br>
<i> &gt; can't kill their host, as this latest "spinglage" on cryptography seems to</i><br>
<i> &gt; show. That need for a market "host" for socialism to suck blood from, in the</i><br>
<i> &gt; end, is what has saved our freedom again, if it can ever be said to be under</i><br>
<i> &gt; any threat at all, cryptographic "advocacy" notwithstanding.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; And so, the Clinton administration now apparently understands that to kill</i><br>
<i> &gt; strong cryptography is to kill financial cryptography, and thus digital</i><br>
<i> &gt; commerce. It's pretty simple, really. One need only count the nine zeroes in</i><br>
<i> &gt; the internet sales figures from individual companies like Cisco or Dell, and</i><br>
<i> &gt; the unbelievably scary growth of commerce on the internet in the past three</i><br>
<i> &gt; years, to understand its inexorable economic necessity.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Someday, practically *all* economic activity will happen on the internet, or</i><br>
<i> &gt; its decendants, and, if you think that strong financial cryptography is</i><br>
<i> &gt; necessary now to keep your credit card number safe, wait until you see what</i><br>
<i> &gt; is required for cash itself to be exchanged, using very strong cryptographic</i><br>
<i> &gt; "bearer settlement" protocols.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; And cash *will* be used on the internet. Cash just like you think it is,</i><br>
<i> &gt; anonymous and untraceable.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Why will we use cash and other instantly settled digital bearer instruments?</i><br>
<i> &gt; Because it will be cheaper. Cheaper than checks, which are already being</i><br>
<i> &gt; digitized. Exponentially cheaper than encrypted credit card transactions,</i><br>
<i> &gt; which force you to borrow money just to pay for things, not to mention tell</i><br>
<i> &gt; everyone where you spend your money just to keep everyone honest about the</i><br>
<i> &gt; fact that you paid them.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; More to the point, digital cash, using digital bearer settlement protocols,</i><br>
<i> &gt; will be cheaper to use than paper cash or even coins. After all, you can't</i><br>
<i> &gt; shove a nickle over a wire, and electrons are probably the only things which</i><br>
<i> &gt; are cheaper than paper or base metal.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; These new forms of digital bills and coins will be safely "spendable" in</i><br>
<i> &gt; larger -- and even more especially, smaller -- amounts, than we can spend</i><br>
<i> &gt; with physical cash today.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Large enough to clear and settle multi-billion dollar currency trades in the</i><br>
<i> &gt; blink of an eye.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; And small enough for your computer to purchase what it needs from the net in</i><br>
<i> &gt; terms of information, even bandwidth, as it is used, on a pay-as-you-go</i><br>
<i> &gt; basis. After all, we pay for what we use on the internet now, but we buy it</i><br>
<i> &gt; in advance, in fixed monthly fees, and usually with a check after someone</i><br>
<i> &gt; sends us a bill. At the very least, we pay indirectly, when we purchase an</i><br>
<i> &gt; advertised product.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Believe it or not, most of that money you spend on internet service goes</i><br>
<i> &gt; down an administrative rathole.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; If we had the ablity to purchase internet resources in cash, the cost of</i><br>
<i> &gt; accounting for those resources, that is, the billing and payment for those</i><br>
<i> &gt; resources using offsetting debits and credits in your checking and credit</i><br>
<i> &gt; card accounts -- and, by extension, the accounts of every entity on the</i><br>
<i> &gt; network -- would effectively dissapear.  Money would change hands where it's</i><br>
<i> &gt; cheapest to move it, in secure transactions on the cheap and insecure public</i><br>
<i> &gt; network, instead of the way it now does, using insecure transactions on</i><br>
<i> &gt; expensive private secure financial networks.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; The savings, particularly in the human resources needed to manage all those</i><br>
<i> &gt; accounts, all those triplicate septennially-archived double-entry debits and</i><br>
<i> &gt; credits, would be enourmous compared to the other so-called "book-entry"</i><br>
<i> &gt; forms of transaction settlement we all use today.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; And simple internet service isn't the only place where these strong</i><br>
<i> &gt; cryptographic financial "protocols" would change how business is done. For</i><br>
<i> &gt; instance, the actual cost of delivering a phone call, excluding marketing,</i><br>
<i> &gt; and especially accounting costs, is less than 5% of the cost of that call,</i><br>
<i> &gt; and probably smaller. Especially if you took away the resource allocation</i><br>
<i> &gt; decisions of where to put switches, lines, etc., which all now have to be</i><br>
<i> &gt; arrived at manually, and replaced them with automatic market-based ones. We</i><br>
<i> &gt; won't even think about the cost of regulation and taxes. At least for the</i><br>
<i> &gt; time being.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; If, however, switches were able to accept digital cash bits at the time of a</i><br>
<i> &gt; telephone call's execution, the billing cost for that call would just</i><br>
<i> &gt; dissapear. So too would the marketing of the call, because, with cash</i><br>
<i> &gt; settlement, telephone switching becomes what's called a fungible commodity,</i><br>
<i> &gt; like grain, and would be priced and graded by quality of bandwidth, just</i><br>
<i> &gt; like so much rice. Remember, at the grain elevator, there is no "branding"</i><br>
<i> &gt; by whose farm the grain came from, it's all just grain. Finally, the human</i><br>
<i> &gt; decisions about where to build switches themselves would go away, because</i><br>
<i> &gt; the switches which made the most money would save enough cash out of</i><br>
<i> &gt; operations to quite literally buy better -- or probably just more -- copies</i><br>
<i> &gt; of themselves.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; You can do this with just about anything. Take electricity. The British have</i><br>
<i> &gt; done experiments about sending internet service down power lines, so paying</i><br>
<i> &gt; digital cash for electricity on the same line you use it from is completely</i><br>
<i> &gt; possible, especially in a world of hypercompetitive, deregulated</i><br>
<i> &gt; electricity.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; You can do this with roads. Just use cheap little chips in the road, each</i><br>
<i> &gt; one collecting micro-tolls as a car rolls past, and, of course, raising the</i><br>
<i> &gt; price as traffic builds up. A brave new world indeed. Except, of course,</i><br>
<i> &gt; with privacy.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Fungible-service pricing in instantaneous cash-settled auction markets will</i><br>
<i> &gt; probably destroy our entire concept of "natural" monopoly. And, as Moore's</i><br>
<i> &gt; law continues to heat up financial transaction settlement, creating a new,</i><br>
<i> &gt; geodesic economy, great hunks of that industrial economic glacier we're all</i><br>
<i> &gt; familiar with will start calving off to float off and melt into an ocean of</i><br>
<i> &gt; real-time information, financial and otherwise.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; And, yes, Virginia, you can do every financial transaction we now have with</i><br>
<i> &gt; these digital bearer settlement protocols as well; stocks, bonds, and every</i><br>
<i> &gt; exotic derivitive thereof you can imagine.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; We won't even talk about what it will do to the ultimate "natural" monopoly,</i><br>
<i> &gt; the monopoly modern nation states have on force. Besides, if everything's</i><br>
<i> &gt; paid for in cash on the net in perfect anonymity, how are they going to beat</i><br>
<i> &gt; taxes out of us? So much for Blue Wednesday.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Which, of course, brings us back to the modern era's General William</i><br>
<i> &gt; Westmoreland, FBI Director Louis Freeh, a man who made his "bones"</i><br>
<i> &gt; wiretapping mafiosi in the "pizza connection" heroin case.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Frankly, if Mr. Freeh knew how bad it really was going to be for his "army"</i><br>
<i> &gt; someday, maybe even just a few decades away, I bet he'd even be more</i><br>
<i> &gt; energetic in his fight to listen in to everyone's phone calls, or read our</i><br>
<i> &gt; email, or even, with such ludicrous totalitarian schemes like key "escrow",</i><br>
<i> &gt; pretend to be us to our own banks and take our money should we try to hide</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt;from him with better cryptography than he can crack. All of this with the</i><br>
<i> &gt; click of a mouse.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Fortunately for us, Mr. Freeh, like General Westmoreland, has been too busy</i><br>
<i> &gt; making up bodycount numbers, or at least sightings of "the four horsemen of</i><br>
<i> &gt; the infocalypse" (pedophiles, terrorists, drug dealers and money launderers,</i><br>
<i> &gt; all using cryptography the FBI can't break) for what he hopes will be the</i><br>
<i> &gt; next 5 o'clock follies, thinking Tet was just another holiday for the</i><br>
<i> &gt; natives.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Well, until yesterday, anyway.</i><br>
