I was referring to storage density, not storage speed. Nanomechanical<br>
storage systems should require no power unless bits are being read or<br>
written, so power dissipation is a function of I/O speed. Three-dimensional<br>
storage in a nonomechanical system, using 100 atoms per bit alllows<br>
a fair number of extra atoms for "overhead" functions such as support<br>
and heat-conduction. The energy dissipated to read or write a bit<br>
nanomechanically should be very small compared to that needed by current<br>
technology, and diamondoid should be able to operate at much higher<br>
temperatures than silicon-based devices. Diamondoid is a much better conductor<br>
of heat than silicon, also.<br>
<p>
Reversable computation may be useful for logic functions, subject to the<br>
problems you describe. As I understand it, it's not relevant for storage.<br>
