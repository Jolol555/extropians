The following report makes a seemingly compelling<br>
case for banning a type of genetically altered<br>
seed, known as the "Terminator Technology" (TT).<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.arkinstitute.com/98/up0606.htm">http://www.arkinstitute.com/98/up0606.htm</a> <br>
<p>
I'd like to see counter arguments to it<br>
before I make up my mind. Here's the <br>
picture the report painted for me:<br>
<p>
In a nutshell, the TT causes a genetically <br>
altered crop to yield only seeds that will<br>
NOT grow. This ensures that farmers cannot<br>
resell hybrid strains and that the farmers <br>
cannot produce their own seeds and thereby <br>
become independent of the seed company. <br>
<p>
Concern focuses on the possibility and apparent<br>
plan of the major seed companies to convert all<br>
agriculture to crops "dead-ended" by a TT genetic<br>
dead-seed sequence, which would mean that all <br>
farmers and the people they feed would be depen-<br>
dent on the few seed companies to supply seeds <br>
for the next years harvest, and these companies <br>
seem to be merging into one. In short, if TT <br>
crops took over, no one could grow their own <br>
food from the seeds that they themselves grew.<br>
<p>
But could TT crops take over? Maybe so...<br>
<p>
Concern also focuses on the possibility that <br>
TT genetic information will spread to other <br>
crops in areas where farmers had chosen NOT <br>
to use TT controlled crops, thereby slowly <br>
forcing them under the control of the seed <br>
companies because their crops now increasingly <br>
yield dead seeds. In short, a vision of global <br>
domination by a few seed companies is presented <br>
in the cited report as a possibility. Reading <br>
about the merging of these companies into <br>
larger entities fits into such a scenario<br>
and takes it to the extreme Supreme Monopoly.<br>
<p>
Even short of nightmare of total food control<br>
by an evil monopoly is the concern of a seed-kill <br>
genetic sequence being set loose into the gene <br>
pools of various human life-sustaining crops.<br>
The process of seed-to-crop-to-seed... has <br>
been and is what has keeps humans alive!<br>
A genetic code that breaks that cycle<br>
could have devastating repercussions.<br>
<p>
<p>
SO, is this just anti-technology paranoia, or is<br>
there real reason here to be concerned and maybe<br>
even to call for the outright prohibition of TT?<br>
<p>
It's obvious that if each farmer chooses to <br>
purchase TT controlled seeds, it's their choice,<br>
and that's freedom. True, but people CAN choose <br>
to become slaves, particularly if they can't see<br>
exactly how their choices now will lead to that.<br>
If every farmer thinks, "I'll do the TT seeds be-<br>
cause they are RoundUp resistant, so I can kill<br>
all weeds," no one farmer chooses to become a slave<br>
(each assuming other seeds would still be around),<br>
but because all other non-TT seeds went out of <br>
business, All the farmers choose slavery!<br>
<p>
So X might in fact not be able to sucker any one <br>
farmer to purchase slavery, and yet X could sucker,<br>
and only sucker, them All, so long as each assumes<br>
other farmers will support non-TT seed companies<br>
to the extent they even consider that they need <br>
other seed options to exist to be free farmers. <br>
