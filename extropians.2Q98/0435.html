<p>
Well, yes in a sense. What I was trying to say was that I did not <br>
want to redefine the concept, i.e. alter the meaning of <br>
the term 'transhumanism. Rather, I was trying to give an alternative <br>
characterization of the pre-existing concept. In this sense there can <br>
be several definitions that are all correct (though they can't, of <br>
course, substantially contradict wach other).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;"Transhumanism is the idea that the human condition will </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be dramatically transformed by technology and that it is a good thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to use rational methods to overcome our biological limitations."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "the human condition will be dramatically transformed" won't do because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaves open all kinds of tranformations that we certainly do not seek. Are</i><br>
<i>&gt; we to transform ourselves into mindless drones? Into animals? Into</i><br>
<i>&gt; creatures lacking the human drives to create, to understand, to learn? My</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition avoids this problem.</i><br>
<p>
The definition doesn't assert that we *want* any of those <br>
transformations. It leaves open the possibility that they might <br>
happen. If we were 100% sure that the transformation could only <br>
happen in the way we prefer, then we could cancel our efforts and <br>
spend the rest of our days drinking cocktails. I see it as a virtue <br>
that the difinition doesn't simply assume that things will work out <br>
right.<br>
<p>
As I see it, transhumanism has a descriptive and a normative <br>
component:<br>
<p>
The first conjunct in my definition expresses the <br>
descriptive component. This is the hypothesis that the human <br>
condition will be dramatically transformed by technology. It could be <br>
weakened to "can be dramatically transformed". This would make the <br>
prediction conditional upon the appropriate actions being taken. But <br>
I think that practically every transhumanist believe the stronger <br>
claim that this *will* happen (in a good way or in a bad way), so why <br>
water it down.<br>
<p>
The second conjunct expresses the normative component, that we *want* <br>
the human condition to be transformed, and that we *want* it to <br>
happen in such a way that we can overcome our biological limitations. <br>
(Individual transhumanists might in addition have more specific <br>
goals, such as libertarianism, hedonism, the Far Edge party etc. <br>
etc.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Okay, so here is my revised definition. I'll refine it further if anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; can pick holes in it! The final version will go in the Neologisms section</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ExI's web site, and I'll also contact the editor who called me from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oxford English Dictionary. (They are considering the terms "transhumanism"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "extropy" and "extropian" for the next revision of the OED.)</i><br>
<p>
:-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life that seeks the acceleration of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; development beyond its currently human limitations by means of science,</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology, creativity, and other rational means.</i><br>
<p>
Now, if it's going into the OED, we have to work on it hard. (I think <br>
this version is much better than the previous one.) Here are some <br>
more comments:<br>
<p>
1. Is the "of life" really necessary? It sounds a bit clumsy to me. <br>
Also, not all aspects of transhumanism are directly related to the <br>
"How to live?"-question: part of it is very theoretical discussions <br>
about the likelihood of extraterrestrials or the future development <br>
of microprocessors.<br>
<p>
2. I miss the descriptive, factual part. As it stands, it is purely <br>
normative: "WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO TRANSCEND<br>
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY". I think an essential part of transhumanism is <br>
the belief that the human condition *will* (with high probability) be <br>
dramatically changed by technology. (However, hopefully "we seek" <br>
will be understood to imply that we believe the possibility exists. <br>
Since I can't think of a nice brief formulation that makes the <br>
factual claim more explicit, I won't include it in the modified <br>
version I will suggest below.)<br>
<p>
3. "the acceleration of our  development..." I like the *sound* of <br>
this, but I have some ideological problems with it:<br>
"accelerate" means move faster. While we tend to be excited by new <br>
technological breaktroughs, I wonder whether this speed-paramenter <br>
should be part of the definition. Sure, we want to develop further, <br>
and yes, other things equal, most of us would presumably want this to <br>
happen sooner rather than later. But what the optimal speed of <br>
development is, is something that depends on a complex tradeoff <br>
between  costs, benefits, risks, practicalities and policy-issues. I <br>
think transhumanists can have different views on this. We shouldn't <br>
make the "As fast as possible, no matter what!" attitude a <br>
transhuman catechism. Suppose someone is impressed by the dangers of <br>
nanotechnology, and wants development to be delayed until we <br>
have developed proper nano-immune systems. Such a person might think <br>
that the pace at which we are developing today is about right; it <br>
wouldn't be good to accelerate more. It seems to me this person could <br>
be a perfect transhumanist. I'm sure the above definition could be <br>
streched and interpreted in such a way as to accomodate for this; but <br>
there does appear to be some strain.  I think it much more <br>
important that we get to our goal than that we get there a couple of <br>
years sooner or later, though I'm aware of the enormous amount of <br>
misery that every year or month of delay will cause. We want to be <br>
sane, responsible drivers, not speed-intoxicated madmen ideologically <br>
compelled to max the accelerator.<br>
<p>
What about(?):<br>
<p>
TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy that seeks to advance our development <br>
beyond its currently human limitations by way of science, <br>
technology, creativity, and other rational means.<br>
