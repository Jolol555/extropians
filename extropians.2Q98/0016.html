"So I felt quite uncomfortable when video surveillance cameras began to <br>
rise over our city, on high poles, looming over our neighbourhoods. In <br>
fact, I would rank cameras in increasing order of acceptability (fairness) <br>
as follows: <br>
<p>
     Government looking at people. <br>
     Establishments looking at people <br>
     Establishments looking at establishments or people looking at people <br>
     People looking at establishments ("shooting back") <br>
     People looking at government ("shooting back") <br>
<p>
with a neutral position in the middle (people looking at people). <br>
Surveillance is actually desirable when aimed at Big Brother (and possibly <br>
also Big Business). It would seem logical that organizations capable <br>
of wrongdoing should be placed under a degree of surveillance proportional <br>
to their capacity to inflict damage on society. The potential damage, <br>
to society, of a large and unaccountable organization, operating above <br>
the law, is far greater than the damage that an individual might inflict <br>
by stealing a loaf of bread. Thus it is possible that society would do <br>
well to place certain large organizations under greater scrutiny than a <br>
shopper at the local convenience store, or someone living in a house near, <br>
or walking down a public sidewalk past, a gas station."<br>
<p>
I agree...<br>
