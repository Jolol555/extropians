We can acknowledge truths that are useful - or rather those<br>
that we think are useful (the difference in who believes what<br>
here is one of ethics, not of approach.  If I use a tool, say,<br>
a knife, to slice bread, while a criminal uses it to kill a person,<br>
we are not similar [in our actions or goals], we just use the<br>
same tool.  We all use the same time, space and energy as<br>
the bad guys - does it make us the same?  No, as long as<br>
we are trying to use them for different ends.  Same with<br>
scientific methods).<br>
<p>
We can also, in the extension of the utilitarian approach,<br>
acknowledge truths that may prove to be useful at some<br>
point (and what can't?), for us or somebody/something else,<br>
we acknowledge hypotheses that simplify our understanding<br>
of the world (that's what we always actually have in place of<br>
truths), we promote creation of new truths - things that<br>
never existed before, but are useful, expansion of ourselves<br>
to make better use of more things and ideas, growth of our<br>
appreciation of things we have, etc., etc.<br>
So we expand the truths (the complexity of existing world),<br>
ourselves, and the relations between us.  (Totalitarian regimes<br>
usually attempt to simplify and restrict all of the above, BTW)<br>
<p>
Of course, our work is guided by our interests, this seems<br>
the only way a conscious entity can guide its activities.<br>
