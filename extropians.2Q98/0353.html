The title/theme of the current (May) issue of Discover Magazine is:<br>
"Reinventing Life." It has several articles on the biological sciences.<br>
(I'm not sure if they have a web site up or not.)<br>
<p>
There are several good articles in the issue including:<br>
<p>
An article on the future of fusion energy (unrelated to the main theme)<br>
<p>
An article on the current status of genetic engineering (general) and the progress <br>
being made in the human genome project.<br>
<p>
An article on genetically engineered animal organs and 'test tube grown'<br>
organs for use in humans.<br>
<p>
An article on using gentic engineering to significantly enhance the human<br>
condition and for creating 'designer children.'<br>
<p>
An article on using info and techniques from ontogeny (related to developmental <br>
biology) to correct physiological disorders and improve the human condition. <br>
<p>
An article on the status of "assisted reproduction science" and the impact<br>
it will have on "society".<br>
<p>
An article on cloning.<br>
<p>
And an article on genetic engineering of plants for various uses, primarily<br>
for food.<br>
<p>
For those of you who keep up with these topics, there will not be a lot of <br>
new information (some). But for those who have not been keeping up with the <br>
latest information, these articles will do a good job of "bringing you up to <br>
speed."<br>
<p>
IMHO, worth reading.<br>
