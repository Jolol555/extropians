<i>&gt; This does not answer the basic question. Should I be able to profit</i><br>
<i>&gt; from my own labors? If I write a novel, I should be able to market it</i><br>
<i>&gt; without having to worry about someone else taking my work, adding an</i><br>
<i>&gt; introduction, and selling it at much less than my publisher's costs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; thereby destroying my market.</i><br>
<p>
That's two different and unrelated questions.  Sure, you have a right<br>
to profit from your work just as Mark McGuire has a right to profit<br>
from hitting home runs.  But does that mean he should be able to<br>
profit from runs he hit 5 years ago, or prevent other batters from<br>
studying his swing?  If you made such a bad deal with your publisher<br>
that someone copying your work can cut into your profits, whose<br>
fault is that?  I say it's yours; the costs of exclusion are borne<br>
by every other business, why should /I/ bear the costs of exclusion<br>
for /yours/? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I create a logo for my enterprise, should someone else be</i><br>
<i>&gt; permitted to use it to sell their products?</i><br>
<p>
That's a trademark, not a copyright or patent; an entirely unrelated<br>
issue.  Using someone else's identity is willful fraud, and I have<br>
no problem with enforcing a tort in that case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyone who hangs too tightly to their creations will not benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; from them; neither will the world. But saying that ideas and their</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical embodiments are not the property of the thinker and</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventor certainly does nothing to help.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.  It's not my place to help anyone.  Businesses should<br>
bear their own costs, not come to me for help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have no objection to others using my ideas to act as a springboard for</i><br>
<i>&gt; them to reach even greater heights. I only object to others using my</i><br>
<i>&gt; creations to deny me a chance to make a living by undercutting me with</i><br>
<i>&gt; duplicates of what I made.</i><br>
<p>
Then don't use business practices that encourage that.  The present<br>
system is based on the assumption of copyright; without it, different<br>
business models would evolve.  This is a good thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; After all, if they can concieve of a better way to do what I am doing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; surely I can use their take on the matter to leapfrog them..</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, so long as no laws are in the way... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Copying, however, is cheating. By your arguments, if I copy your doctoral</i><br>
<i>&gt; thesis, I should be able to claim the degree just as if I had done all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; research. After all, it's not 'theft'.</i><br>
<p>
Well, you could publish my thesis, but I presume that a college who<br>
granted degrees to people for using a Xerox machine would not have<br>
a very good reputation.<br>
