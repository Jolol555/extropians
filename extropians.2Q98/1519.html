"Atherosclerotic Cholesterol Ester Deposition is Markedly Reduced With a<br>
High-Potassium Diet"<br>
<p>
Abstract:<br>
<p>
  In a normal rat on a normal diet, no cholesterol esters are detected in<br>
the aorta by gas chromatography. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive<br>
rats (SHR) were fed for 3 months a basic diet containing 4% cholesterol,<br>
14% coconut oil and 7% NaCl. One group of 13 rats ingested a normal (0.5%)<br>
level of potassium in the diet. Another group of 10 rats ingested a high<br>
(2.1%) potassium level. Mean intra-arterial blood pressures averaged 165<br>
mmHg in the normal-potassium group and 161 mmHg in the high-potassium<br>
group. Serum cholesterol levels averaged 229 mg/dl in the normal-potassium<br>
group and 214 mg/dl in the high-potassium group. Total aortic cholesterol<br>
esters per rat involving 16- and 18-carbon chain fatty acids averaged 187<br>
microgram in normal-potassium versus 68 microgram in high-potassium rats.<br>
These were the main esters; other esters were negligible. Thus, the<br>
high-potassium diet reduced cholesterol ester deposits by 64% (p&lt;0.0003),<br>
even though blood pressures and cholesterol levels were quite similar in<br>
the two groups. Both high cholesterol and high blood pressure injure<br>
endothelial cells and increase the invasion of macrophages and vascular<br>
smooth musccle cells into the intima; they also increase endothelial<br>
permeability to proteins. With high plasma cholesterol levels, these<br>
processes lead to atherosclerosis with choleseterol eester deposition. The<br>
high-potassium diet, by protecting endothelial cells, can greatly decrease<br>
this cholesterol ester deposition. This effect could be useful for<br>
preventing heart attacks and sudden coronary death in human hypertension.<br>

Additional note:<br>
<p>
   A 0.5% diet works out to about 3 grams of potassium for a human<br>
consuming 2500 calories of rat chow. This a little above the average<br>
potassium intake by Americans. A 2.1% diet works out to roughly 12 grams,<br>
which is typical of stone-age human diets.<br>
