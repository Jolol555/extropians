            "First, we kill all the 11-year-olds..."<br>
<p>
  Meaner than the mean kids who go on shooting sprees are the measures <br>
adults are pursuing in the name of combating crime -- including proposed <br>
legislation to execute preteens. <br>
<p>
BY ROBIN TEMPLETON | A series of high-profile school-site killings by <br>
young boys -- including last week's shooting spree in a Springfield, <br>
Ore., high school cafeteria -- have precipitated a more predictable <br>
horror: proposed legislation to try 10-year-olds as adults and apply the<br>
 death penalty to 11-year-olds. It is as if a handful of problem <br>
children -- "mean kids" we call them -- are absolving adults of having <br>
to deal with the problems of children. <br>
<p>
"Current juvenile laws could not have anticipated violent crimes being <br>
committed by children this young," explains Texas State Rep. Jim Pitts, <br>
who is sponsoring the latest round of legislation. <br>
<p>
But it is Pitts' generation that warrants concern. For the past <br>
quarter-century, aging baby boomers -- not children or teenagers -- have <br>
driven the upsurge in violent crime. The FBI reports that arrest rates <br>
for violent crime have doubled for 30- to 49-year-olds since 1975. <br>
Homicide by children under 13 occurs less frequently today than in 1965. <br>
<p>
<p>
Texas is not a lone state. Long before Jonesboro, the governors of <br>
California and New Mexico appealed in the name of victims of juvenile <br>
crime for laws to lower their states' execution ages to 14 and 13, <br>
respectively. On state and federal fronts, efforts are proliferating to <br>
sentence children as adults, abolish the protective segregation of child <br>
from adult inmates and limit parole for juvenile offenders. New Jersey <br>
is deploying military-designed satellite technology to track juvenile <br>
parolees cuffed with 8-pound transmitters. The head of the state's <br>
Juvenile Justice Commission boasts that the system is like "Star Wars." <br>
<p>
In short, the war on crime has become obsessed with young people -- but <br>
as targets rather than victims, predators rather than prey. Which <br>
shouldn't surprise young people. After all, children are far more apt to <br>
be murdered by adults -- including their own parents -- than the other <br>
way around. "The only time people really pay attention to kids is if we <br>
pick up a gun and blast somebody," a 16-year-old friend observed a week <br>
after the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, Ark. Yet most young people <br>
are more concerned about missing breakfast than dodging bullets. Some 12 <br>
million children are malnourished in America today, according to the <br>
Children's Defense Fund. The poverty rate of young people overall is 50 <br>
percent higher today than it was in 1970. <br>
<p>
Adults' response to all this would make Charles Dickens shudder: Since <br>
1970 we have cut back spending on education by at least 25 percent and <br>
upped funding for incarceration by $3.2 billion. If the present rate of <br>
incarceration continues, one out of every 20 children born in 1997 will <br>
spend time behind bars. For males the figure will be one out of 11, and <br>
for African-American males it will be one in four. <br>
<p>
The irony is that the generation of baby boomers backing these policies <br>
grew up, by and large, distrusting adults. Today it is adults who <br>
distrust the young. A Rand Corporation survey in 1996 found that <br>
American adults believe juveniles cause 50 percent of violent crime. The <br>
FBI, by contrast, reported that year that juveniles caused 10 to 15 <br>
percent of violent crime. Last March -- the same week that media <br>
headlined the Jonesboro shootings -- the FBI reported a 30 percent drop <br>
in the juvenile homicide rate over the past three years. <br>
<p>
"I know what World War III will be -- a war against teenagers," <br>
predicted Emilio, 17, after watching "Twelve Monkeys," a film about <br>
postapocalyptic dystopia. According to the National Criminal Justice <br>
Commission, spending on crime fighting is actually increasing three <br>
times faster than defense spending. The spectre of 10- and 11-year-olds <br>
dressed in camouflage, toting rifles as they stalk their peers, serves <br>
as the new "Red menace" for a prison-industrial complex that is coming <br>
to rival the military-industrial complex. This time the enemy is among <br>
us -- our own children. <br>
<p>
Wars, of course, can be useful. World War II drafted 10 million American <br>
men after the Great Depression rendered more than 15 million Americans <br>
jobless. In deindustrializing economies, prisons convert otherwise <br>
expendable and potentially subversive residents into raw material and <br>
profit margins. The war on crime is assimilating young people on the <br>
margins by criminalizing them largely for nonviolent, economically <br>
motivated offenses such as drug possession. Three-strikes-you're-out <br>
laws make it clear that there is no such thing as redemption once you've <br>
activated the tripwire. <br>
<p>
Facing up to Springfield -- or Pearl, Miss., or Memphis or Jonesboro -- <br>
will require acknowledging that children devalue life to the extent that <br>
the adult world devalues their lives. In towns long considered America's <br>
heartland, mean children are arming themselves in imitation of adults <br>
increasingly determined to prove they can be meaner. <br>
