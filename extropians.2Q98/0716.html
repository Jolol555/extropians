Just a brief follow-up, since I must leave...<br>
<p>
"Agnostic" -- a-gnosis -- means someone without knowledge of god(s). The<br>
weak form of agnosticism is held by one who believes they *do not* have<br>
knowledge of any possible god(s). The strong form is held by one who holds<br>
the positive view that they *cannot* know whether there is a god or gods.<br>
<p>
The strong form of agnosticism implies a certain view of human knowledge.<br>
Essentially it implies that questions of the existence of gods lies<br>
definitely beyond human knowledge. I suspect that many people are attracted<br>
to this position because they equate knowledge with absolute,<br>
non-contextual certainly. I think that equation is thoroughly wrong.<br>
<p>
If you have a reasonable standard of knowledge, or of rational belief, then<br>
you can look at the arguments and the evidence and conclude that there is<br>
no reason to believe in a god. That lack of belief, that a-theism, makes<br>
you an atheist. The agnostic, by contrast, has a standard of knowledge such<br>
that they may think they can never know or rationally come to a conclusion<br>
on the issue.<br>
