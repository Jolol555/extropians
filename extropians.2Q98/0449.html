IT WAS JUST RELEASED!!<br>
<p>
INTRODUCING...MILLIONS VOL. 1<br>
<p>
We took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the <br>
touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some were $300+)!  <br>
We added the millions we had in storage to those.   When we <br>
combined them all, we had in  excess of 100+ million addresses <br>
in one huge file. <br>
<p>
We then ran a super "sort/de-dupe" program against this huge list. <br>
It cut the file down to less than 25 million!!! Can you believe that? It <br>
seems that most people that are selling CD's are duping the public <br>
by putting numerous files of addresses in the CD over and over. This <br>
created many duplicate addresses. They also had many program<br>
 "generated" email addresses like Compuserve, MCI, ANON's, etc. <br>
This causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables, and for  those <br>
that use Stealth programs, clogs up servers quickly with trash, etc. <br>
<p>
We then ran a program that contained 150+ keywords to remove <br>
addresses with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster,<br>
 webmaster, flamer, abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .edu, <br>
.mil, .org, .gov, etc.   After that list was run against the remaining list, <br>
it  reduced it down to near 16 million addresses! <br>
<p>
So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all <br>
others that are out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like<br>
 using the 100+ million that we started with, but a lot  less money and <br>
alot less time!!  <br>
<p>
We also purchased Cyber-Promos ($995.00) CD.   We received it just <br>
prior to finishing production work on the new CD.   We had our people <br>
take a random sample of 300,000 addresses  from the touted 2.9 that <br>
they advertised.   We used a program that allows us to take a random <br>
sample of addresses from any list.   We were able to have the program <br>
take every 9th address, thus giving us a 300,000 list of Cyber's email <br>
addresses from top to bottom.  We did not clean  these, but we did create<br>
3 seperate files named cyber1.txt, cyber2.txt, &amp; cyber3.txt of 100,000 <br>
addresses each. This will give all people that use the list a opportunity to<br>
send mail to the list before deciding if their CD is all it's hyped to be. <br>
<p>
We also included a 2+ million "Remove/Flamer" file broke into seperate<br>
files for ease of  extracting and adding to your own database of removes. <br>

What others are saying:<br>
<p>
"I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I <br>
immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over <br>
the course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I <br>
received less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied<br>
with my purchase!!  Thanks Premier!!"<br>
