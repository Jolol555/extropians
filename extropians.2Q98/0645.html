<i>&gt;The book was quite a bit different. There was a team of travelers, no</i><br>
<i>&gt;terrorists, no second machine, and the group was sequestered after their</i><br>
<i>&gt;return for fear of what they would tell the world. I guess since Carl Sagan</i><br>
<i>&gt;was dead, they had greater 'artistic license'...</i><br>

I don't have the book right here to refer to, but as I recall there was in<br>
fact more than one nation attempting to build a machine and get "there"<br>
first.  The coolest thing that was in the book that wasn't in the film was<br>
near the end.  We were instructed to run out the value of pi (sp?...22 / 7 =<br>
3.141........) out as far as we could.  As all of you recall, it is a<br>
non-repeating decimal.  A program was designed to monitor the run for any<br>
non-random deviations.  After pi was calculated out to millions or billions<br>
of places a binary sequence of numbers suddenly started appearing (1's and<br>
0's) creating a message.  The idea being that "God" had chosen to provide us<br>
with irrefutable evidence of his existence by placing a message inside of a<br>
geometric constant that any advanced civilization would discover.  That's<br>
heavy.  To think that there's a message from a superior being hidden<br>
somewhere in the fabric of the universe for those advanced enough to<br>
discover it.  Too heavy for the film version, I guess.  Actually, I'm a bit<br>
surprised to see this plot point given Sagan's book, The Demon Haunted<br>
World.  How could he summarily reject superstitious nonsense and retain some<br>
belief in a supernatural being that creates puzzles for us to solve?<br>
<p>
One of the latest stories on the news is about the Hubble's discovery of a<br>
group of planets forming around a star and how this will affect our<br>
expectations that extraterrestrials exist.  I, personally, have sided with<br>
Robin Hanson and have grave doubts that there anyone else is out there.<br>
There may, in fact, be no one to contact.  It may well be us who are<br>
eventually "contacted" by others.  If we make it.<br>
