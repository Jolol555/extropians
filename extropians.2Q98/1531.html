The May issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics contains two<br>
articles that pertain to aging at the cellular level. One reviews<br>
genetic strategies to study it, and the other offers more support for<br>
the theory that programmed cell senescence results in the<br>
manifestations of aging.<br>

GENETIC FACTORS IN HUMAN AGING<br>
<p>
'Causes, Effects and Constraints in the Genetics of Human<br>
Longevity', by Francois Schachter of the Laboratory of Human<br>
Immunogenetics, Pasteur Institute, Paris (page 1008)<br>
<p>
Schachter uses a five-level biological heirarchy (Finch and Rose,<br>
1995) to examine various genetic factors in human aging. Schachter<br>
opens by noting that Jeanne Calment (oldest known humanand recently<br>
deceased at the age of 123) was descended from agenetic lineage that<br>
contained a disproportionate number of familymembers who lived beyond<br>
the age of 80.  Due to the aggregatenature of the longevity trait,<br>
however, he sees little utility in pursuing strategies that would<br>
increase the occurrence of this trait.  Nor has the recent increase<br>
in the mean human MLS (maximum life span) resulted in an increase of<br>
the actual MLS, which has continued to hover at ~120.  In the next<br>
few sections of thearticle, Schachter makes the case for rejection of<br>
attempting to regulate or propogate longevity as a trait: 'The four<br>
genes so far implicated in longevity, APOE, ACE, HLA-DR, and PAI-1,<br>
share common features:  (1) they have an impact on intermediary<br>
traits, such as plasma levels of a homeostatic protein or immune<br>
response, and (2) they display gene-environment interactions in<br>
normal adult populations. . . these genes appear to affect longevity<br>
by modulating an individual's responses to life-threatening<br>
disorders, not by regulating MLS as an intrinsic physiological<br>
trait.'  <br>
<p>
After a section on CA (compensatory adaptation) and on chronobiology,<br>
Schachter moves on to the human genome and our murky understanding of<br>
its role in longevity.  He suggests the potential utility o f<br>
X-chromosomal loci as a testing ground for models of DNA damage in<br>
cellular aging:  'the X chromosome is at the same time protected in<br>
the germ line and critically vulnerable in the soma. . .'  He cites a<br>
study that indicates a significant drop in the lifespan of daughters<br>
born of elderly fathers compared to sons born of the same fathers.  <br>

REPLECATIVE CELL SENESCENCE AND MORTALITY FACTORS<br>
<p>
'The Genetics of Cullular Senescence' by Nathalie G. Berube, James R. <br>
Smith, and Olivia M. Pereira-Smith of the Huffington Center on Aging, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston (page 1015).<br>
<p>
The authors conclude that identification of the genes involved in<br>
regulating programmatic replicative cell senescence could lead to<br>
greater understanding of the aging process and strategies to manage<br>
it.   <br>
Comments from John Ashkenas, editor:  'Do our bodies age as<br>
iron rusts-passively, with the accumulation of damage due to<br>
external insults?  Or, are the physiological changes of aging better<br>
conceived as an intrinsic development process, similar to those of<br>
our early histories?  Berube, et al, review the recent evidence from<br>
cell-culture studies in favor of the latter model.  As Berube et al.<br>
demonstrate, cells must continue to express several mortality<br>
factors if they are to retain their normal capacity to senescence,<br>
that is, to stop proliferating after a characteristic number of<br>
divisions .  The accumulation of sensescent cells in various tissues<br>
may explain many of the conspicuous features of aging.'<br>
