<i>&gt; elite of the elite will survive to become transhumans then I could give a shit</i><br>
<i>&gt; about any transhuman economy, thank you very much.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I personally would prefer that all of humanity make the transition, and I'm<br>
fairly optimistic that this will occur. See below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The best humanity can hope for is that transhumanity is altruistic,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If so, then transhumans will help humans become transhumans.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ?That would be ideal.  But 'altruism' is one particular value than has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; given a bad rap by several on this list.</i><br>
<p>
IMO, individuals are actually reasonably civil and reasonably altruistic, up<br>
to a point. Each person has a different threshold. As the cost of doing a good<br>
deed goes down, the cost eventually goes below the threshold and the deed<br>
is done. If newer technology makes it easy to help others at low cost,<br>
more help will be provided. Speaking personally, If nanotech provides<br>
a "universal factory box" for me, I'll make another for free and give<br>
it to anyone who asks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Very rapid increases in productivity caused by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nanotechnology or AI may have the effect of a dramatic deflation. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so, the rich may not be in much better shape than the poor: Your money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is useful only as feedstock for the nanotech, with exactly the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; value as dirt. On the other hand, the necessities and luxuries of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; life will be essentially free, so who cares? On the third hand, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be transhuman, so there is no way that a simple human such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; myself can judge whether this will make you happy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is all very true, but it dodges the question of how the majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people will survive just getting to that nanotech transhuman phase.  It's the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sophisticated automation leading up to nanotech that first poses a problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, you can't get from 1 to 3 without passing through 2.  2 is what I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; been talking about.  How do you survive the *transition*?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Good, we are in agreement. The transition is the problem. However, you couched<br>
the problem in terms of traditional "rich" and "poor" which IMO assumes a fairly<br>
slow transition. If the transition ruptures the economy, then the rich/poor<br>
axis is not relevant. The nerd/technophobe axis may be more relevant.<br>
<p>
If you have time, please sketch out your concept of the transition era, its<br>
length, and its outcome.<br>
<p>
My own conception is considered fairly radical. I feel that the existing<br>
economy will take us to the point that a superintelligence (SI) will<br>
emerge effectively overnight. The SI will then do whatever it wants,<br>
with unpredictable results. I hope the SI will ask each human to join<br>
it, either as elements or equals, but I have no way to evaluate the<br>
probability of this.<br>
<p>
So, as you see, my concept is a "snap transition." Most economists<br>
appear to believe in an "infinite transition", i.e, that humanity<br>
and human economics will define the economy forever. Others on<br>
this list favor something in between. My point is that each scenario<br>
has a different set of economic problems for individual humans<br>
and humanity in general during the transition.<br>
