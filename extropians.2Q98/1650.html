  IAN: I think that that gets to the heart of <br>
  the matter pertaining to why truth is seen <br>
  as an unreliable standard... my truth, their<br>
  truth, this truth, that truth. The same sub-<br>
  jective morass applies to utility, their <br>
  utility, my utility, this, that...<br>
<p>
  But this picture paints a false "same as"<br>
  relation between utility and truth. While<br>
  utility can always be defined as subjec-<br>
  tive (even a useful thing like a spoon <br>
  is not useful if you prefer to eat with<br>
  your hands), but truth is no so subjec-<br>
  tive. If all can see that it's raining<br>
  outside, but one guy says it's a sunny<br>
  and dry day, we may say, "Well that's<br>
  the truth for him," but I'm comfortable<br>
  is saying that it is not THE truth, and<br>
  thus I feel we can say truth is objective.<br>
<p>
  I believe that we can have a scientific<br>
  definition of truth (a one-one or maybe<br>
  onto function, or both) that eliminates<br>
  in one fell swoop this morass of subjec-<br>
  tive truth,  which I think is a direct<br>
  threat to science and ethical standards<br>
  as this leads to a "utility first" frame-<br>
  work that leads to "anything goes."<br>
