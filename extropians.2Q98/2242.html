Since there's been so much talk about it, I thought I'd just go ahead<br>
and post the letter that I wrote and sent to Alex Beam and to the<br>
Globe Letters to the Editor address two days ago. I tried really hard<br>
not to be too negative or smartass, but y'all can judge whether I<br>
succeeded (probably didn't).<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>

************************************<br>
<p>
Dear Mr. Beam,<br>
<p>
Thank you for bringing the subject of cryonics back to the pages of<br>
the<br>
Boston Globe. Yours is a highly respected newspaper, and cryonics is<br>
indeed<br>
a newsworthy topic.<br>
<p>
Having followed the field for most of a decade, I have seen literally<br>
hundreds of news reports in all forms of media. Unfortunately, your<br>
article, despite its brevity, fits neatly into the categories of "most<br>
error-filled" and "least researched". Although yours is not the first<br>
to<br>
gain such distinction, I do find it mildly disappointing, because<br>
unlike<br>
most journalists in the past, you seem to have gotten your information<br>
via<br>
the internet (the best, easiest to use research tool that has ever<br>
existed). I appreciate that you might have been tailoring the piece<br>
for the<br>
"Living | Arts" section rather than the "Health | Science" section,<br>
looking<br>
to entertain as much as to educate. But errors are errors, and I feel<br>
pretty confident you could have avoided many of them simply by<br>
spending<br>
just a few more moments actually reading the pages you cited and<br>
following<br>
the links, rather than simply looking for points to criticize and<br>
ridicule.<br>
<p>
If you are interested in getting the details right, below I offer some<br>
quotes from your piece, along with comments of my own that I hope will<br>
be<br>
helpful.<br>
<p>
   "He hopes that scientists will discover a way to revive human<br>
   life from frozen tissue before the Apocalypse, or before his<br>
   yearly payments to Arizona-based Alcor Life Extension<br>
   Foundation run out."<br>
<p>
Yearly payments to Alcor will not "run out". I'm not sure how closely<br>
you<br>
looked at Alcor's funding requirements, but yearly dues ($360) are<br>
paid<br>
only while the member is alive. At the time of suspension, a one-time,<br>
lump<br>
sum of $50,000 (for Neurosuspension) or $120,000 (for Whole Body) must<br>
be<br>
paid to Alcor. Part of this pays for the initial suspension procedure.<br>
The<br>
rest (the majority) is invested, with the interest paying the ongoing<br>
costs<br>
of low temperature storage. The lump sum is usually provided via life<br>
insurance, which is cheap and affordable for most folks. What this<br>
means is<br>
that dues and life insurance premiums are paid to make and maintain<br>
suspension arrangements. But after suspension, there are no further<br>
costs<br>
to the individual, his family, or his estate. In my case, the total<br>
cost<br>
for my life insurance and dues amounts to $70/month.<br>
<p>
   "1. They are all nerds."<br>
   "2. Twenty-five of the 26 are men."<br>
   "3. Most of them, with the exception of Cambridge's own<br>
       Marvin Minsky, live in California."<br>
<p>
For starters, point #2 here is just wrong. Kennita Watson is indeed<br>
female,<br>
but so are Ailing Freeman, Terry Stanley, and Chris Peterson. That's 4<br>
out<br>
of 26, not 1 out of 26. (Did you even follow those links? Or did you<br>
just<br>
look at the names?)<br>
<p>
But more importantly, using Ralph Merkle's listing as your data sample<br>
is a<br>
pretty skewed, unscientific method of data gathering about<br>
cryonicists.<br>
There are approximately 700 cryonicists who have made arrangements to<br>
be<br>
suspended. Predictably, Ralph's list contains mostly close friends and<br>
colleagues of his, and of course, he could only link to people who<br>
actually<br>
have web pages. This explains why they're all nerds, and why almost<br>
all of<br>
them live in California.<br>
<p>
If you're interested in the actual data, the numbers really look like<br>
this:<br>
<p>
A loose usage of the word "nerd" might apply to 70% of cryonicists.<br>
The<br>
other 30% certainly have to have at least some respect for science and<br>
technology, but they're not nerds.<br>
<p>
Females represent approximately 33% of our total these days, and that<br>
figure has risen steadily over the years. Certainly we males would<br>
like it<br>
to be more like 50% (or 90%!), but the real picture isn't nearly so<br>
grim as<br>
you've painted it.<br>
<p>
Californians represent approximately 33% of cryonicists. The rest are<br>
scattered throughout the states, with additional concentrations in New<br>
York, Florida, and Arizona.<br>
<p>
   "As with everything, it pays to shop around. Wilmington,<br>
   Del.-based CryoSpan claims to flash-freeze ''humans and their<br>
   companion animals at the lowest possible price,'' which turns<br>
   out to be an annual $250 for ''neuro'' (brain only) or $1,500<br>
   for the full monty."<br>
<p>
CryoSpan's fees are one-time lump sum payments of $58,500 for<br>
Neurosuspension, $125,000 for Whole Body Suspension, same as with<br>
Alcor.<br>
The "yearly fee" of $250 for Neuro or $1500 for Whole Body represents<br>
the<br>
ongoing costs of long-term storage. These are not separate charges.<br>
They<br>
are paid via interest accumulation from investment of the initial lump<br>
sum.<br>
Looking at CryoSpan's page on the web<br>
(<a href="http://www.cryocare.org/cryospan/cryospan.html">http://www.cryocare.org/cryospan/cryospan.html</a>),  I see that this<br>
distinction is not made perfectly clear. Nevertheless, what you<br>
printed is<br>
wrong, or misleading at the very least.<br>
<p>
   "The only woman who may be available for soulful chats at<br>
   sunset is Kennita Watson, a Libertarian activist who has run<br>
   for statewide office several times in California."<br>
<p>
This is wrong for the same reasons listed above. Even if you only took<br>
Merkle's sample of 26, there are 3 others. Your usage of the word<br>
"may"<br>
hardly excuses making the world think that Kennita is the only female<br>
cryonicist. There are *hundreds* of signed-up females, with more on<br>
the<br>
periphery, in the process of making arrangements.<br>
<p>
Again, I do appreciate that you were trying to write an interesting,<br>
light-hearted piece about the strangeness we Californians indulge<br>
ourselves<br>
in, and had you stuck to your take on things, I would have no problem<br>
with<br>
even a severe hatchet job (which your article certainly was not). But<br>
many<br>
readers will be left with very wrong impressions about cryonics that<br>
the<br>
facts simply do not support, taking your word as a journalist, and<br>
believing that you have done your research properly.<br>
<p>
Revile us or ridicule us all you like. We know this isn't for<br>
everyone, we<br>
have a sense of humor, and we can take a good ribbing. But please get<br>
the<br>
facts straight while you're doing it. A printed correction would seem<br>
to be<br>
in order here.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Derek Strong<br>
