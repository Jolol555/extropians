I do, and they all are in the hands of both the Air Force and the Navy. The Army has<br>
no strategic nuke capability. They have tactical nukes, with maximum ranges of less<br>
than acouple hundred miles. While missiles like the Pershing (which I beleive might<br>
have all be retired by now) are Ballistic missiles, they are not intercontinental<br>
ballistic missiles. They might have some ground launched cruise missiles that I am not<br>
aware of, but they would most likely be conventional warheads or small tactical nukes<br>
to support ground troops.<br>
<p>
THis arrangement is in marked contrast to some other nations, like China and the<br>
former Soviet Union, which had and have Strategic Rocket Forces, usually as part of<br>
the Army or as a separate military service entirely.<br>
<p>
Additionally, I don't think that the ICBM is of strategic military significance,<br>
although it is of strategic diplomatic significance. While this may be picking nits,<br>
it is a significant difference.<br>
