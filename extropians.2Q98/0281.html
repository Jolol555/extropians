<i>&gt;...and their effect on the hormones in the human body...notably</i><br>
<i>&gt;insulin...that many  fat people (myself included i imagine &lt;5'll...260lbs&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;develope a condition he calls "hyperinsulinism"...which over an extend time</i><br>
<i>&gt;leads to all manner of bad things..notably obeseity...and it's attendant</i><br>
<i>&gt;ills.(heart attacks, diabetes, strokes...and other nasty stuff)...</i><br>
<p>
I have been involved in learning about health, fitness and bodybuilding for <br>
9 years (since I was 13), and I have worked as a nutritionist and fitness<br>
instructor so I have a bit of experience on this topic.<br>
<p>
You are correct: very high blood concentrations of insulin and glycogen can do <br>
some very bad things  other than obesity. All of the things you listed and more. <br>
One thing it does is known as "glycolization" which is a build up of cellular garbage <br>
that causes "cross-linking" of proteins. This is not a good thing if you are striving for <br>
immortality (like me) because it can ultimately damage DNA. <br>
<p>
One solution to this particular problem is to eat a very  low carbohydrate diet such <br>
as described in books by atkins and other books like "The Zone..." But the Atkins <br>
diet has problems of it's own (see below) Another, possbily better solution is to<br>
eat a moderate amount of carbohydrates, but make sure you eat only "low glycemic<br>
index" carbohydrates. Glycemic index (GI) is a scale that measures how much insulin<br>
is released by your body as a result of eating certain foods; it was first devised for <br>
diabetics, but is useful to anyone seeking health. You can find GI food charts on the web, <br>
at health food stores or ask a doctor. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problem being that someone suffereing from said ailment (hyperinsulinism)</i><br>
<i>&gt;has a well neigh impossibe task facing him trying to loose weight via</i><br>
<i>&gt;conventionally prescribed methods...i.e. cut back calories...</i><br>
<p>
In order to lose wieght you must eat a high protien, low-medium carb, medium fat, calorie<br>
diet. And you must create a caloric deficit meaning burn more calories than you<br>
consume. It IS as simple as that, but it is NOT as easy as that. It takes time <br>
because your body has to totally readjust. If you have hyperinsulinism <br>
then you're body is very insensitive to insulin and another body mass<br>
regulating hormone known as leptin. You're body has to "upregulate"<br>
or resenstize itself to the lower level of insulin, glucose and leptin.<br>
Once that happens the fat loss will accelerate. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So........I imagine the militant veggies are a trifle upset with this...it</i><br>
<i>&gt;could be called a "hi protein" , "hi fat" or "meat eaters" diet.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've always wanted to get a ketotic diet proponent in a room with a vegan</i><br>
<i>&gt;to watch the fireworks :-)</i><br>
<p>
Vegtables are still good for you because many (but not all) are low GI. Also<br>
don't cook them as this increases GI (not to mention does lots of other nasty things.)<br>
You don't even *have to* eat meat to do a ketogenic diet because you can get protein from <br>
supplements like whey, soy or egg protein, and you can eat "healthy" fats like those<br>
found in walnuts, almonds, flax oil, primrose oil, peanuts, olive oil etc. instead of <br>
saturated animal fat which *is* unhealthy. So it *is*<br>
possible to be both a veg-head and on a ketogenic diet, although I have no idea<br>
who would want to do this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It does work for weight loss (at least temporarily) but the metabolic</i><br>
<i>&gt;state your body is thrown into does not sound healthy.  One side effect my</i><br>
<i>&gt;wife and her family noticed is that it causes very bad, sulphurous body</i><br>
<i>&gt;odor.  With a large family and a small house this was not appreciated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think having these kind of chemicals floating around in your</i><br>
<i>&gt;body would be good for you.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The real problem with diets isn't losing weight, it's keeping it off.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've seen figures suggesting that 90% of dieters regain all the lost</i><br>
<i>&gt;weight within two years.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In addition to substantial fat loss, ketosis is a strong diuretic and you'll</i><br>
<i>&gt;lose a lot of water as well</i><br>
<p>
I have personal experience with ketogenic diets. Yes they do work very well for <br>
weight loss. Yes, you will stink if you eat that way. You may experience nasausness,<br>
weakness, and you may have trouble thinking clearly. It is also correct that you will<br>
lose a lot of water, so for safety reasons it is important to drink a lot of water. (Water<br>
weight is *not* the type of weight you want to lose.) No, it is not healthy<br>
for a long term diet. I would call the ketogenic diet a "short term militant weight<br>
loss tactic." It is not a long term strategy if you value your health; it has a <br>
number of nasty side effects. But for short term it is OK. My personal experience<br>
with this is that you will need to eat at least 75% of your calories from fat, and most<br>
of the difference should be made up of protein (to preserve lean muscle mass).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Research on the long-term safety of ketotic</i><br>
<i>&gt;diets is zilch, which I consider inexcusable given than Dr. Atkins has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;pushing this diet for 25 years.  Not even a rodent study</i><br>
<p>
Actually, there has been some research done on it. Like I said, the results <br>
showed short term use will not be harmful. But long term use is harmful for several<br>
reasons. Unfortunately I don't have the refs handy. <br>
<p>
If you decide to try the ketogenic diet you should also go to a drug store<br>
and buy what are called "keto sticks."  This are little pieces of paper that you <br>
put your urine on - they change color if you are in ketosis. This sounds gross,<br>
but it is important to do becasue it is the only way you will be able to tell if you<br>
are in ketosis or not. If you are not, then the diet will not be effective because you<br>
will still be buring carbs for fuel instead of fat. Contrary to what some people say,<br>
you can not just "eat whatever you want" on this diet becasue you will still <br>
have to create a caloric deficit in order to burn fat; so you will not be able to "pig out."<br>
<p>
I must warn you though: It takes an *enourmous* amount of self discipline to stay<br>
on a ketogenic diet. Here is why: your brain chemistry gets all out of wack. Your<br>
body uses carbs to make seratonin, one of the brain's neurotransimittors. (It is the<br>
"happiness" neurotransimitter.) If your body has so few carbs that it goes into <br>
ketosis, it will most likely not have enough to make seratonin. As a result,<br>
your body will "tell you" you should eat more carbs. You will have the most<br>
horrendous carb cravings you have ever experienced. But if you pig out on<br>
carbs at this point, you will gain even more weight because your metabolism<br>
will have slowed from the reduced carb and calorie diet. <br>
<p>
One way to mitigate<br>
the seratonin problem is to use some sort of drug or supplement that creates<br>
seratonin or prevents the breakdown of it. The drug dex-fenfluramine (formerly<br>
used in phen-phen and Redux) did this, but it has some bad side effects. Some <br>
bodybuilders I know use methamphetamines for this purpose, (and also to speed <br>
up their metabolism) but obviously this is not a good idea. You could use <br>
Prozac which is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibiter (SSRI) which might help.<br>
But my suggestion would be to use a combination of the herb St. Johns Wart<br>
which also acts as a natural SSRI without ANY known negative side effects (perhaps <br>
nasuau) and maybe some dexitrim which also helps.<br>
<p>
So no, you won't be "hungry" on a ketogenic diet, but you will still crave carbs to <br>
make seratonin. OTOH with a high carb diet you end up being hungry all the time <br>
because your body releases and burns all the carbs very quickly, and doesn't<br>
have enough of the "slow burning fuel" (eg protein and fat) to maintain level<br>
blood sugar levels. "All things in moderation." -- Ben Franklin. I have found <br>
that for a normal diet I get the best results with 40-45% carbs, 35-40% protein,<br>
and 20% fat. For losing fat I do 45% protein, 35% carbs, and 20% fat, just with<br>
lower than normal calories. But everyBODY is differnet. YMMV. You will have to see <br>
what works best for you. Everyone has an individual learning curve about<br>
his or her own body.<br>
<p>
Yes, most people regain lost weight. The key to keeping it off in general is to <br>
make total life style changes. Make eating healthy and excercising a regular<br>
part of your life. Most people fail becaus they aren't willing to do it permanently;<br>
they see it as a short term "fix". Need motivation?: If you are striving for <br>
immortality just ask yourself the question "what is more important to me, life,<br>
or a cheesburger?" I haven't looked at a cheesburger since. :-) <br>
<p>
The key to keeping off the weight after a ketogenic session is to come off of <br>
it gradually, and not eat too many carbs at once. Keep your total calories the<br>
same, but gradually shift the macronutrient composition to more (but not too<br>
many) carbs. Once you are back to your revised carb intake level, then you <br>
may be able to increase calories without gaining much weight. You might <br>
want to increase your excercise when you do this though. <br>
<p>
BTW - you shouldn't ever try to lose "weight" you should try to lose *fat* You<br>
should go to a gym and have your body composition measured. Scales should<br>
really not be your progress guage. Maintaining muslce is important because<br>
it has a high metabolism (and you do want to be able to move don't you ;-).<br>
<p>
Also - I have never seen a fat loss program work that did not include excercise.<br>
For best results I would recommend a combination of weight training *AND* cardio. <br>
         <br>
Hope this helps.<br>
