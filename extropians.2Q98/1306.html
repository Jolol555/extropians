Dear Extropian Folk &amp; Hara Ra:<br>
<p>
I'm glad to have this questionaire distributed to the community that<br>
first raised in me the questions posed here. Extropian writings and<br>
ideas have been valuable to me for a long time, and I'd very much<br>
appreciate your input, not only responses but also suggestions for<br>
further questions.<br>
<p>
***BUT*** Andrew Edmond is not connected to this survey. He's the<br>
moderator of the E-NEWS list and was kind enough to distribute the<br>
questionaire on that list. But he's a busy man (running the excellent<br>
entheogen site <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org">http://www.lycaeum.org</a>) and isn't directly involved<br>
in this project anyway. Please send all responses to me, j_d01@gnofn.org<br>
<p>
Again, thanks for your interest and responses. I hope to eventually<br>
summarize results on Dave Pearce's wonderful site (<a href="http://www.hedweb.com">http://www.hedweb.com</a>),<br>
which was also a big inspiration for this quiz and may be of interest<br>
to many of you.<br>
<p>
Yours sincerely,<br>
Jesse Davis<br>
