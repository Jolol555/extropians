<i>&gt; From: T0Morrow &lt;T0Morrow@aol.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Like Laplace, I have little need for the god hypothesis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; But the atheistic certainty in god's non-existence strikes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; me as a bit too cock-sure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Responded otter@globalxs.nl (den Otter):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Being sure of your case (or at least pretending to be sure) has a memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  advantage, and if you're wrong and there *is* a "god", so what? Nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  would matter anyway. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whether or not a claim has a "memetic advantage" hardly settles the issue of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what claims to make.  Back when people spoke of "rhetoric" rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; "memetics" (a fine distinction, I suppose, but one must stay au courant the</i><br>
<i>&gt; buzzwords), they widely recognized that persuasion should stop short of</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsehood.</i><br>
<p>
I see no falsehood in the claim that "the existence of (the Judeo-Christian)<br>
god is so unlikely that it can be treated in the same way as the [potential] <br>
existence of elves: it is irrelevant to everyday life. Furthermore, the existence<br>
of a Supreme Being, especially one with the characteristics of the Judeo-<br>
Christian god is not desirable to the more serious transhumanist, because<br>
it would likely frustrate his tecno-ascension and severely curb his freedom."<br>
<p>
I don't know whether or not the above should be called "atheism", <br>
"agnosticism" or something else, but it seems like the most rational<br>
approach. As for the "memetic advantage": transhumanism and religion<br>
(and most political ideologies etc.) are competitors in the memetic <br>
field, they both hunt for the souls of the undecided. People tend to<br>
go with the strongest (loudest) speaker, and since many of the competing<br>
philosophy's spokespersons are loud and cocksure, similar tactics<br>
must be employed (sometimes -- depending on your audience) to stand <br>
a chance. In this case, the end justifies the means, IMHO of course...<br>
<p>
Questioning your beliefs is good, but there is also something like too <br>
much of a good thing. Just like we assume that the sun will rise <br>
tomorrow, we must also (for the sake of practicality) assume that <br>
god isn't going to come down from the heavens to save/kill/whatever <br>
us.<br>
