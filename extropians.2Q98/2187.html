From:           	John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In 1897 the Indiana house of representatives unanimously passed a bill (#246) </i><br>
<i>&gt; that would change the value of PI from 3.14159... to 16 divided by the cube </i><br>
<i>&gt; root of 3 or 9.2376. The bill was defeated in the state senate by one vote, </i><br>
<i>&gt; good thing too because not only is it wrong it's blasphemous, according to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Bible Pi is exactly equal to 3.</i><br>
<p>
Are you sure about this?  The most authoritative version I have heard (which I <br>
acknowledge that I have not confirmed) is that the state was offered high-school <br>
math textbooks at a steep discount, provided that they enact into law a certain <br>
bill containing a bunch of mathematical language; analysis much later <br>
determined that the bill would have made pi legally equal to some unlikely value <br>
(5, I think);<br>
<p>
but the rules committee of one house of the state legislature, finding the bill <br>
hard to penetrate and being unsure of what they would find within it, referred it <br>
to their Committee on Swamps.  (Even legislatures do something intelligent <br>
once in a while.)<br>
<p>
And there it died.<br>
