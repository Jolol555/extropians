<i>&gt; Cardiac arrest in rodents: Maximal duration compatible with a recovery of neuronal activity</i><br>

<i>&gt; Communicated by Jean Dausset, Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain, Paris, France, February 12, 1998 (received for review December 8, 1997)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We report here that during a permanent cardiac arrest, rodent brain tissue is "physiologically" preserved in situ in a particular quiescent state. This state is</i><br>
<i>&gt; characterized by the absence of electrical activity and by a critical period of 5-6 hr during which brain tissue can be reactivated upon restoration of a simple energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; (glucose/oxygen) supply. In rat brain slices prepared 1-6 hr after cardiac arrest and maintained in vitro for several hours, cells with normal morphological</i><br>
<i>&gt; features, intrinsic membrane properties, and spontaneous synaptic activity were recorded from various brain regions. In addition to functional membrane</i><br>
<i>&gt; channels, these neurons expressed mRNA, as revealed by single-cell reverse transcription-PCR, and could synthesize proteins de novo. Slices prepared after</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer delays did not recover. In a guinea pig isolated whole-brain preparation that was cannulated and perfused with oxygenated saline 1-2 hr after cardiac arrest,</i><br>
<i>&gt; cell activity and functional long-range synaptic connections could be restored although the electroencephalogram remained isoelectric. Perfusion of the isolated</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain with the -aminobutyric acid A receptor antagonist picrotoxin, however, could induce self-sustained temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, in rodents, the duration</i><br>
<i>&gt; of cardiac arrest compatible with a short-term recovery of neuronal activity is much longer than previously expected. The analysis of the parameters that regulate</i><br>
<i>&gt; this duration may bring new insights into the prevention of postischemic damages.</i><br>
