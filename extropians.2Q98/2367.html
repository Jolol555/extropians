<i>&gt; &gt;As for why my definition is better than your three laws?  I posit that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;THESE are the three laws of atomism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1) A is A.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2) A is not both A and not-A with respect to 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;3) A is either A or not-A with respect to 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Here I use "with respect to 0" to mean that the partial difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A and 0 is either A or not-A and not both.  Ask anybody who claims to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;an atomist and they will agree with the laws as posited.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: Why not add "with respect to 0" to 1?</i><br>
<i>&gt;    2 and 3 are holist in nature since they say</i><br>
<i>&gt;    that what A is depends upon something that </i><br>
<i>&gt;    A is not, and thus they are not atomist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    I agree that half of the difference is </i><br>
<i>&gt;    half of the difference, and half defines</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the whole by default. If I give you $50 </i><br>
<i>&gt;    and say this is half of the fee, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    identity of the whole fee is revealed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    so the ID of the whole is in the half.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    The area just outside the letter A defines </i><br>
<i>&gt;    it as much as the area inside the letter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Its identity contains both areas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Why is my definition better?  My definition is better because it is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;one most people use.  "Atomism" means whatever people use it to mean, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;they happen to use it to mean that A is either A or not-A and not both</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with respect to 0. The omission of "with respect to 0" from your statement</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the laws is trivial: </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: It's really not true to say that I omitted</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the portion that you added to the Three Laws since</i><br>
<i>&gt;    they've never been published your way. Your version</i><br>
<i>&gt;    is holistic, since adding "with respect to" includes</i><br>
<i>&gt;    a relation. It's clear that you've changed the defin-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    tion of atomism to a holistic definition, but kept the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    "atomist" label on it, for what reason I know not, ex-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    cept to be able to say you've evidenced atomism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Isn't that proving how effective product A is in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;    demonstration using product H with an A label on it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    or more exactly, by using a mix of 2/3 H and 1/3 A?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    You said I was confusing definitions, but your changing</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the definitions of atomism is the only confusion I see.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it is implicit in everything that we do or say that we are </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;always referring to the partial difference, and never the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"whole" difference, when we talk about difference. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: When I refer to the high, I refer to </i><br>
<i>&gt;    the low by default;  when I refer to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;    good, I refer to the bad by default...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;    How is it that I don't refer to the whole?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;No one defines "difference" the way you define</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;difference, Ian, and that's all there is to it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: Not true. "Net difference" is not a </i><br>
<i>&gt;    violation of the definition of difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I say that the difference between 4 and </i><br>
<i>&gt;    5 is expressed as 4 - 5 = -1. That's the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    standard definition. So saying that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;    net difference is -1 &amp; 1, is not unique;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    observing that it is the holisitc struc-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    ture of identity is unique.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    What seems to be demolished in your </i><br>
<i>&gt;    analysis is any difference between </i><br>
<i>&gt;    atomism and holism, for to sustain</i><br>
<i>&gt;    atomism you've changed it to holism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually there should be four laws of thought, each reducible to perception </i><br>
(and convertible into each other).<br>
If A, then A (If something's there, it's there)<br>
If not A, then not A (If something's not there, it ain't there)<br>
A or not A (It's either there or it's not)<br>
Not both A and not A (It can't be both there and not there in/at the <br>
same spacetime)<br>
This forms the same type of square we see in Aristotelian or <br>
sentential logic (All A is B, No A is B, Some A is B, Some A is not <br>
B )and in the Greimassian Semiotic Square of semantic structure (S <br>
and P {for instance, knowing-how-to-be}, S and Not-P {for instance, <br>
knowing-how-not-to-be}, Not-S and P { for instance, <br>
not-knowing-how-to-be}, and Not-S and Not-P {for instance, <br>
not-knowing-how-not-to-be}), where S = Subject and P = Predicate.<br>
In addition, all these are amenable to translation into Symbolic or <br>
predicate logic (with its Universal and Existential Quantifiers [For <br>
all X, There is at least one X]).  Clearly there is a deep or <br>
ur-structure here underlying these various manifestations of logical <br>
and linguistic form.<br>
