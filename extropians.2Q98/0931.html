<i>&gt;  I suggest defining the terms this way: Agnosticism (literally, "without</i><br>

<i>&gt;  (literally, "without god") means the disbelief in god, or, equivalently,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the belief that god does not exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Defined this way, there is no reason to struggle with the implicit XOR</i><br>
<i>&gt;  frequently associated with these terms.  I am both an agnostic AND an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  atheist; while I acknowledge that it is impossible to _know_ (i.e.,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  prove) god's (non)existence, it is my belief, based on an absence of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  evidence for a god, that god does not exist.</i><br>
<p>
That strikes me as pretty sensible, though I imagine that theists would assail<br>
you with claims that they *have* got evidence of the existence of god(s).  You<br>
might well counter with an argument about what constitutes valid evidence,<br>
quickly leading to deep epistemological waters, but at least you would have<br>
moved off of theological territory.<br>
<p>
I suggest that the surest way out of this fix is to move away from questions<br>
of whether you do or do not believe in divine entities.  In fact, it often<br>
proves helpful to discard entirely talk about beliefs.  Rather, I prefer (when<br>
trying to keep on epistemologically solid ground) to speak about working<br>
hypothesis about the world, which I hold with greater or lesser conviction.<br>
Like Laplace, I have little need for the god hypothesis.  But the atheistic<br>
certainty in god's non-existence strikes me as a bit too cock-sure.<br>
<p>
Theists may also pose a question for anyone (including me) who adopts the<br>
agnostic line: " Well, then, what *do* you know?"  I'd respond that I know<br>
precious little--just my own sensory experiences (that, eg, I'm now seeing<br>
black and white patterns, that I hear a light humming I attribute to my<br>
computer's fan, and so forth).  By posing this question, the theist wouuld aim<br>
at showing that the agnostic has too-strict standards for knowledge, and thus<br>
has little of value to say about theological matters.<br>
<p>
The agnostic could reply using the sort of epistemology described above:  "I<br>
may not *know* much, but I have a *lot* of good working hypotheses about the<br>
world.  And most of them I hold with far, far greater certainty than the<br>
putative hypothesis that gods exist."<br>
