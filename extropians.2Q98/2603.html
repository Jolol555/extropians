<i>&gt;        &gt;Religion is connected with believe not with explanations. Either</i><br>
you<br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;can believe,  or you can`t.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I understand that, what I don't understand is why believing in something</i><br>
when<br>
<i>&gt;there is no good reason for doing so is supposed to be virtuous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Religions are thought-constructions for people who need them. Many do so,<br>
they just have got to have something that frames their life, something<br>
that`s valid forever, because they`d get crazy if they were fully alone. If<br>
you have an own "religion", you don`t need to take over the thoughts of the<br>
popular religions.<br>
<p>
But it seems that you always need an explanation, a good reason for your<br>
doings. You can`t act without them, right?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;There won`t ever be an explanation in a real religion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;True, and that's exactly why religion is garbage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From your point of view, maybe. Religion is trying to help humans in their</i><br>
lives, but not forcing them to believe. For many people religion is the only<br>
really certain thing in the whole of their lives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Why should God create a perfectly suited world for humans?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If God is a sadist then you're correct, there is no reason to expect him to</i><br>
<i>&gt;treat us with kindness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
A perfectly suited world can`t exist. It couldn`t work.<br>
and:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;If there`re no problems and obstacles there can`t be any</i><br>
evolution.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So what? Evolution is a horribly cruel process, God is omnipotent so He</i><br>
<i>&gt;should not need it to create us, unless He just likes to see us suffer.</i><br>
<p>
I don`t think god is omnipotent in every religion. God just can`t be<br>
omnipotent. Nothing can be perfect or omnipotent.<br>
So, why do you think, evolution is a horribly cruel process? Evolution is<br>
part of nature and we couldn`t exist without it.<br>
<p>
But perhaps God actually wants to see us suffer.&lt;g&gt; Perhaps humans will do<br>
so when they want to create worlds for AL.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;The way you express your explanation implies that you don`t</i><br>
believe<br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;in the freedom of spirit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know if I believe in that or not because I don't know what</i><br>
<i>&gt;"freedom of spirit" means.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
How may I understand this?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;It`s a matter of opinion if something is good or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then God and religion have nothing to say about morality, we already know</i><br>
<i>&gt;they have nothing intelligent to say about the physical world so the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclusion to draw is that the millions of words written by the pious are</i><br>
<i>&gt;utterly vacuous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
You`re right in the first two lines, but your conclusion is wrong. Many<br>
religious texts may be vacous. The most important thing in a religion is<br>
getting support by believing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;If you think like this, you`ll never be religious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thanks, I hope you're right.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
No problem, that`s all right. I`m sure you won`t be religios.;-)<br>
