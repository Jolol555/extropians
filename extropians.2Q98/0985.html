I think we are operating on different timescales, here. Paul is worried about<br>
the transtion era, starting as automation accelerates and ending at the singularity.<br>
After the singularity, as Damien points out, An SI will certainly be able to<br>
concieve of projects with a high demand for resources. In particular, an SI that<br>
wants to maximize its computational resources may very well decide to convert<br>
all available mass in the solar system to neutronium, in order to minimize the<br>
distance (and therefore the delay) between the computational elements. Obviously,<br>
this is likely to have detremental effects on anybody else that is still around.<br>
