Hmm, I don't understand how you can call "do what the majority tell you or <br>
else" democracy an example of antiauthoritarian "spontaneous order", or <br>
claim that it limits and breaks down power structures when the real-world<br>
examples seem to show democratic bureaucracies bloating until they collapse <br>
due to lack of funds to steal.<br>
<p>
That democracy is better than many other forms of government is obvious,<br>
that it's much good for anything is not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Other find that capitalist</i><br>

<p>
It's unfortunate, of course, that libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism is<br>
incompatible with democracy, when democracy is compatible with<br>
libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism.<br>
<p>
I can see that transhumans can support involuntary democracy, but I don't<br>
see that Extropians can; there's nothing spontaneous about being told<br>
what to do by the majority on pain of death for refusal.<br>
