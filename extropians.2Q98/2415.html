Indications are that many people who intended to see this movie have indeed<br>
done so, and I will now share my thoughts on it.  (Warning:  contains a<br>
multitude of plot spoilers)  <br>
<p>
Many of the subtexts within this movie merit discussion in other forums:<br>
media manipulation, privacy, dissent within a mass culture, allusions to<br>
Hamlet and Homer.  One subtext, corporate control of a human life, may<br>
relate to the cloning discussions that took place here many months ago;  I<br>
would like to see someone address that if it interests.<br>
<p>
The transhumanist aspect of this movie that completely hooked me early on<br>
and let me identify with Truman was the way in which Truman's life was<br>
controlled through the use of manufactured limits, and the methods by which<br>
those limits were incorporated into Truman's psyche.  To keep him on the<br>
island 'voluntarily', a violent death at sea was staged, in which Truman<br>
'loses' his father and henceforth must avoid open water.  In his days at<br>
grade school, the young Truman stands up proudly in class and declares, 'I<br>
want to be an explorer, just like Magellan...'  On cue, the teacher<br>
instantly draws down the world map and sweetly tells Truman, 'You're too<br>
late!'  Airplanes lose parts that fall from the sky and posters in the<br>
travel agency warn of dire consequences to those who venture abroad (yet<br>
this does not deter Truman from booking a flight to Fiji, one aspect of the<br>
plot that seems out of place.)  The analogy is obvious--many of our fears<br>
and limitations as human beings have bases in the the society around us and<br>
its agents.  <br>
<p>
When the cracks begin to show in the carefully constructed world, and Truman<br>
begins to realize the mechanations of events surrounding him, at first he<br>
thinks he is losing his mind.  Everyone treats him as if he were indeed<br>
losing his mind, in order to contain his growing independence and<br>
questioning.  At this point in the movie, one can see the strain under which<br>
the actors labor;  their lives have reached a stasis point in which the only<br>
achievement to strive towards is the repression of another's desire to break<br>
out of a stultifying routine.  <br>
<p>
The filmmakers brought out this theme in the latter half of the movie by<br>
casting it as a classical epic, in which Truman battles against a<br>
manipulative god who would rather kill his creation than lose his control<br>
over it.  Truman survives a terrible storm and thinks that his escape is<br>
complete---and then his boat literally runs into the end of the world.  Now,<br>
please understand--I don't generally have big emotional reactions to movies,<br>
most are too calculated for my taste.  But when Truman stands against that<br>
wall and realizes the true enormity of what he faces, and he throws himself<br>
against that well, trying to physically will himself through it to<br>
freedom--well, I just lost it and had to go see the movie again in order to<br>
see the full ending!  The last twenty minutes of the film provide a perfect<br>
visualization of the human species trying to break free of the twin shackles<br>
forged by religious belief and by mortality. At least Truman got to confront<br>
his god, and to reject him with as much grace and dignity as a chattel slave<br>
can muster upon shedding the chains.  I hope that someday we all get that<br>
chance.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
