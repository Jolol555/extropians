Artists and scientists have similar techniques. Both start with some<br>
problem or question. What makes things fall down? Why do I feel this way<br>
about her? Who are our ancestors? Where's the party?<br>
They both use instruments.<br>
They both experiment and get assorted results.<br>
They test the results-artists often by performing or showing the work.<br>
They and thier peers often draw conclusions based on the work.<br>
Both draw the fire of critics.<br>
Both discliplines elevate the individual human spirit.<br>
