[Sent to me, so I'm forwarding it -- Damien R. Sullivan]<br>
<p>
Bruce Sterling's "Maneki Neko" in Fantasy and Science Fiction  attempts<br>
to recount a world not far from our own when artifical intelligences<br>
use/work with human networks to manipulate political and economic<br>
systems. The discussion you've been having on open networks has been<br>
really interesting to me, but the dialogue has always seemed to assume<br>
that it will be the individual and the national political establishment<br>
battling each other for secrecy control. John KClark assumes that<br>
Tempest technology will not be as effective as quantum cryptography,<br>
while you cite that the physcial infrastructure can always be tapped and<br>
exploited. Codes can be broken by distributed computing and Java is<br>
already being drafted to tap unused cycles on host machines connected to<br>
the world wide web, so I tend to fall on the side of the pessimist when<br>
it comes to secrecy. But having read Sterling's story, as mentioned<br>
above, I began thinking that it might be possible to join a neo-tribal<br>
communications group. I know the idea sounds far out, but Brin's<br>
watchdog seniors and Sterling's anonymous network agents seem to be the<br>
best possible ways for dealing with increasing encryption and<br>
surveillance. These groups balance the power of the state and the<br>
individual in ways that seem constructive. I foresee problems like "My<br>
clique cracked your clique's codes: Nahhh!!" and even possible tribal<br>
warfare like the Hatfields and McCoys or even Scottish clan structure,<br>
whereupon the state would be caled in to finalize the dispute. And if<br>
individuals are hassled by a larger power structure like the federal<br>
government or a criminal syndicate, the tribal group could be called<br>
upon for protection. The individual and the state are not surmounted by<br>
the tribal identity, only complemented. Of course, the federal<br>
government starts tapping everyone now (which John K Clark says is<br>
unfeasible), before these organizations develop, then I'm just whistling<br>
Dixie.<br>

            With thanks, Clay Draper<br>
