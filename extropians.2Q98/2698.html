<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;even in the unlikely possibility that there is something more       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;fundamental than information we need not worry about it because         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;we'll never understand it. Information on the other hand we        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;understand, in fact it's the only thing we can understand.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It does not follow from the fact that X is that which allows         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;definitions to exist that X cannot be defined.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Well, if you look up the definition of "beautiful" in a dictionary and learn <br>
it's something that has beauty you won't be much the wiser, but it's really <br>
irrelevant because in my original comments I never said anything about <br>
definitions. People rarely have definitions for the concepts they use every<br>
day and rarely need them. Nearly all our knowledge, and all the really <br>
important stuff, comes to us by way of example not definition.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What we're looking for is information about the ontological status         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of information.  </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
Yes, information about information, exactly correct, that's all we're ever <br>
looking for.      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Is information fundamental?  That's the kind of question to be         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;resolved by the parent of all empirical sciences, philosophy</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I think Astronomy is the parent of all Science, philosophers have been big on <br>
theory but notoriously poor at empirical science, Aristotle was a complete <br>
embarrassment as a scientist. And I still maintain we'll never discover <br>
anything more fundamental than information, you'll never prove that you and I<br>
and the entire visible universe aren't just a software program running on a <br>
hyper computer somewhere. I'm not saying that's what's happening, I'm saying <br>
it could be and we'd never know. Besides, even a hyper computer can't operate <br>
without information.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'm not sure that it would be correct to characterize pure         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;mathematics as the study of information about information. Numbers         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;need not necessarily inform us of anything but themselves.  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
If something informs us about anything then it can only be one thing, <br>
information.<br>
