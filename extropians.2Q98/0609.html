<i>&gt;&gt;Animals do not kill meaninglessly and aggressively.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Furthermore, animals only kill others for food or defense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These are common myths and have been dispelled by animal</i><br>
<i>&gt;behaviorists. Many animals have been observed killing for reasons</i><br>
<i>&gt;other than food, defense, or territory including:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Numerous primates (man,chimp,baboon)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Members of the cat family (lions,tigers, etc)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Members of the Bear family</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Members of the dog family (wolfs, coyotes, and worst of all feral</i><br>
<i>&gt;dogs)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;killer whales (Orca Orcannis)(sp?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;snakes, especially members of the mamba.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These are just the ones I remember off the top of my head. In many</i><br>
<i>&gt;cases the observers concluded these animals killed solely to kill.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This of course does not mean all of the species, all of the time.</i><br>

Yes, indeed. In fact, the old saying 'like a fox in a henhouse" would<br>
apply here. If you go into a henhouse after a fox has been in there,<br>
you will find all of the chickens dead and perhaps only one or two<br>
eaten. The fox likes to kill and has it in his genes. I have seen a<br>
panther catch a bunch of sheep in a pasture and break the necks of all<br>
of them and eat only one.<br>
<p>
People do idealize animals while often denigrating humans in many<br>
ways. Chimps for example, our closest primate cousins. I have seen<br>
videotape of chimps hunt down other monkeys and tear them apart and<br>
eat them.<br>
 <br>
Another example of people idealizing animals is dogs: I find them to<br>
be considerably less than human.Some years ago I worked as a  cable TV<br>
repairman, who had to go into backyards where the homeowner was not<br>
around. This often ocassioned confrontations with  territorial dogs. I<br>
found something out: no dog will attack you if you are on guard and<br>
facing them. Almost all territorial dogs will attack you when your<br>
back is turned and you are moving away from them (e.g. climbing over<br>
the fence to leave). Dogs are basically cowards, when it comes to<br>
humans, anyway.<br>
