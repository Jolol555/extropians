<p>
Are the scientologists transhumanists? They would be according to the<br>
above definition since they want to become 'active thetans' or<br>
whatever. <br>
<p>
It is nice with very broad definitions, but definitions can become so<br>
broad they are useless or loose important points. The above definition<br>
cannot distinguish transhumanism as it is discussed on this list from<br>
(say) gnosticism or the ideas of taoism. I think it is a mistake to<br>
ignore the "how", since it has many very important consequences, and<br>
in the case of transhumanism the distinguishing factor from general<br>
transcendentalism (or whatever to call it, is there a standard name<br>
for the idea?) is the "how" - we believe it can be achieved through<br>
reason and technology (not necessarily *only* through reason and<br>
technology, but they provide a possible path).<br>
<p>
My current definition of transhumanism is: "The idea that the human<br>
condition can be improved above and beyond the current stage, through<br>
rational means in a life affirming way".<br>
<p>
I have begun work on a webpage (unfortunately in Swedish right now)<br>
tracing the history and philosophy of transhumanism, and I argue there<br>
that modern transhumanism has three "parents": transcendentalism<br>
(becoming more than humans), humanism (putting an emphasis on human<br>
matters, freedom and reason) and the technism of the enlightenment<br>
(using science and technology to improve things, guided by reason). We<br>
have inherited many memes from each, and the result is a synthesis<br>
that isn't similar to any of them. Unlike the transcendentalists we<br>
embrace reason and technology for change, unlike the humanists we<br>
think the human condition can be fundamentally changed and unlike some<br>
of the techists we appreciate the sensual aspects of life and the<br>
possibility of using self-organization instead of rigid planning for<br>
some systems.<br>
