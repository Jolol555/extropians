<i>&gt; &gt; Has anyone figured out how to tell if two black holes are paired with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wormhole? I can think of a situation where all black holes reach 'into'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; another space - so that if you pass through any entry, you can choose from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all possible exits. Russian roulette, anyone?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hardly. First, the wormhole into another space you get in the ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schwartzschild metric is non-traversable, it collapses (from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; travellers perspective) before anything gets through (and the presence</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the past of a collapsing star wrecks it in the first place). Things</i><br>
<i>&gt; are better in the charged (Reisser-Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black</i><br>
<i>&gt; hole metrics, where you have not just one but an infinity of</i><br>
<i>&gt; exits. Unfortunately infinite blueshifts and other nastiness most</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely both fries you and modifies the rather unstable metric to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; it impossible to get through.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (see Lecture Notes on General Relativity by Sean M. Carrol,</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://itp.ucsb.edu/~carrol/notes/">http://itp.ucsb.edu/~carrol/notes/</a> for a good introduction to GR and</i><br>
<i>&gt; some discussion of these spacetimes)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think black holes are very useful for transport; they have</i><br>
<i>&gt; emerged due to gravitational collapse, not because posthumans should</i><br>
<i>&gt; get cheap travel. If we want wormholes, we better make them ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; (my guess is that creating local inflation could be used to magnify</i><br>
<i>&gt; ordinary quantum wormholes; the high energy quantum gravity</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineering involved is left as an exercise for the student :-)</i><br>
<p>
Is this actually true, has anyone discovered a worm hole?  I think he <br>
is right.  Buy this I mean knowone has traveled through a black hole, <br>
therefor knowone knows what is inside of it (and do not say but we <br>
have sent satilights into them).<br>
If a blackhole were actually a worm hole then it would travel to a <br>
parellel universe, a universe that is off of any of our current <br>
universal tracking.   So I belive it could verywell be possiable for <br>
a blackhole and a worm hole to be the same thing at times.<br>
