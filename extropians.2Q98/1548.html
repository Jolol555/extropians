<i>&gt;Computer Technology (Processing, Interface, Software, Networks):</i><br>
<p>
Processors double in power.  1 GHz are available but mostly unaffordable.<br>
400-500 MHz drops below $1000.<br>
<p>
Interface changes little; flat screens are still expensive, CRTs drop<br>
slightly.  Speech recognition gets good enough that it's almost more<br>
efficient for dictation, if it weren't so expensive and proofreading<br>
weren't so tedious.  Some few products are made available based on EEG<br>
mind-reading.  Mostly just switches, and a few toys.  Cost, coupled with<br>
training time, makes them unfeasible for other purposes.<br>
<p>
Netscape releases its first official upgrade based on open-source research;<br>
Microsoft's browser loses little market share thanks to its licensing<br>
restrictions.  Windows 2000 is put off to Win2001.  Office incorporates new<br>
speech recognition software; sucks compared to competition, but used anyway.<br>
<p>
The biggest pipes have doubled and their number increased by 150%.  Smaller<br>
ISPs start vanishing.  More documents are written in XML than HTML;<br>
searching is still difficult.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Communication Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Cell phones get cheaper, even more ubiquitous.  Quantum computing is<br>
looking more and more feasible as a tool to break codes.  NSA is silent<br>
about its own progress.  Quantum cryptography is still too expensive for<br>
most.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science &amp; Technology:</i><br>
<p>
More work with neural nets made to do more and more useful things.  Nobody<br>
passes the Turing test.  More progress in artificial neurons; finer muscle<br>
control available.  Still exhausting.  Several treatments for Alzheimers,<br>
none of which seem close to a cure, all of which seem to help ease the<br>
symptoms somewhat.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Genetic Science and Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Genome project still coming along nicely.  No human clones anywhere, as far<br>
as the public is aware.  Some private testing still going on, but not<br>
making much progress, and it is increasingly difficult to find scientists<br>
who will help, not so much because of the worldwide ban, but because of the<br>
100% failure rate.  Progress is still being made, but cloning supporters<br>
must fight for every step.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;General Medicine:</i><br>
<p>
A highly invasive and extremely painful treatment for AIDS becomes<br>
available, involving treating the bone marrow in all of the major bones<br>
individually.  Most AIDS patients don't consider it worth the pain, or the<br>
expense.<br>
<p>
Improved artery treatments; no cures on the horizon.<br>
<p>
Angiostatin-endostatin work, but nowhere near as well as they did for mice.<br>
 Submitted for FDA approval as a less invasive treatment, but not a<br>
replacement for other mechanisms.  Research in the direction of treating<br>
cancer by starving its blood supply increases.<br>
<p>
Cryonics research continues, but no breakthroughs or significant<br>
improvements.  Slight improvement in cell damage prevention.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Other Biology:</i><br>
<p>
More germline engineering of farm animals.  Animal rights activists in an<br>
uproar, firms required to label products which have ingredients which come<br>
from genetically engineered life.<br>
<p>
The FDA takes more flak.  It still doesn't care.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Power Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Power market somewhat deregulated in a few areas; some suffer, due to<br>
government regulations still in place, which make life difficult for power<br>
firms.  Failures blamed on the free market.<br>
<p>
A few scattered sources of new energy, but no new compelling alternative<br>
technologies become available.  No progress in cold fusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Manufacturing and Materials Science &amp; Technology</i><br>
<p>
CPU chips start to move away from lithography and towards something else.<br>
(Not precisely certain what.)  Nanotechnology makes more progress, most of<br>
which is still theoretical.  No one looks like they're about to build an<br>
assembler yet.  Those inside the field say that the going is slow; those<br>
outside the field still think it's just around the corner.<br>
<p>
More use of MEMs in military technology.  We don't hear much about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;General Transportation Technology:</i><br>
<p>
The clean car movement: electric, hybrid, etc. continues to progress.<br>
Clean cars become almost as good as gas guzzlers, but much more expensive<br>
to maintain.  Government considers subsidizing the extra costs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Aeronautics:</i><br>
<p>
Little advance in consumer market.  The military keeps on working on<br>
whatever it's working on.  We don't hear anything at all about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Space Technology and Development:</i><br>
<p>
More of the private sattelite companies start seeing the light at the end<br>
of the tunnel.  Two seem ready to go online "real soon now."  Mir is<br>
finally put to rest; no replacement looks ready for the next two or three<br>
years.  Lunar ice studied.  Some talk of private ventures into space; a few<br>
expensive private Earth orbit shuttles, but no real market to speak of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Business &amp; Finance Technology and Practice:</i><br>
<p>
A tiny upstart brokerage starts selling stocks with digital-bearer<br>
settlement.  It's cheaper, but not all that much cheaper, thanks to<br>
remaining government regulations based on book-entry finances.  Other<br>
companies consider it, but payoffs look distant.  Microinvesting becomes<br>
more common in the US.  Digital cash has not caught on; people stick with<br>
SET, which works OK.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Personal Lifestyles:</i><br>
<p>
Pagers and cell phones get really really REALLY ubiquitous, starting to<br>
seriously change the way people live.  People continue to work harder and<br>
consume more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Law and Government:</i><br>
<p>
The government surplus starts to get spent.  No real welfare reform.<br>
Social security hacked up in an attempt to withstand the Boomers.  Those<br>
who know brace for impact; those who don't keep on spending.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Art and Entertainment:</i><br>
<p>
No new movement towards computer art; keeps growing, but no faster than the<br>
art industry itself, maybe even a little slower.  Some new projects which<br>
are interesting, but don't change anybody's lives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2005</i><br>
<i>&gt;Computer Technology (Processing, Interface, Software, Networks):</i><br>
<p>
Processors quadruple.  4GHZ processors drop below $1000.  Speech<br>
recognition looks really good.  Those trained in EEG switches start finding<br>
a market for their efforts.  Networks get AWFULLY fast; Internet continues<br>
its centralizing trend.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Communication Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Cell phones are everywhere; everyone has them.  Pagers all but vanish.<br>
Computer vidphones and phone companies reach a standards agreement.<br>
Quantum computing is used to break a simple DES code.  NSA is silent about<br>
what it's got.  Those who need to stay secure pay the exorbitant cost of<br>
quantum cryptography.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science &amp; Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Scientists start reaching some conclusions about how the mind works.<br>
Spinal regeneration technology starts bearing serious fruit.  Artificial<br>
neurons are indistinguishable from the originals.  Full body transplants<br>
start being able to use their new bodies, though control sucks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Genetic Science and Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Genome project finished.  A human is successfully cloned; a black market<br>
begins to develop.  DNA analysis becomes regular; treatments prescribed<br>
within a day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;General Medicine:</i><br>
<p>
AIDS cure is available, but inconsistent.  Some people walk away as if<br>
they'd never had the disease, others find the virus make a comeback which<br>
scientists find exceptionally difficult to treat.  Heart disease continues<br>
to make progress; no breakthroughs, just slow and steady.  Cryopreservation<br>
makes more progress.  Looks chancy; sometimes animals manage to escape<br>
alive, most die shortly after reanimation.  VERY few animals can survive<br>
reanimation twice.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Other Biology:</i><br>
<p>
Nearly ALL products made with germline engineered plant/animal products.<br>
Market gets used to the idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Power Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Oil shocks start to return, but thanks to various other energy sources, it<br>
doesn't hurt much.  Governments which chose to subsidize alternative energy<br>
find revenues drop as prices want to rise with oil.  Power still government<br>
controlled in most areas.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Manufacturing and Materials Science &amp; Technology</i><br>
<p>
"Smart" materials used in various areas, though not nanotechnologically<br>
based.  Still no assembler.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;General Transportation Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Clean cars subsidized, gas can barely compete.  Government takes a beating<br>
as prices want to rise with the oil market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Aeronautics:</i><br>
<p>
Faster planes; the military lets us know about a breakthrough or two.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Space Technology and Development:</i><br>
<p>
Majority of sattelites are private.  Private launches to the moon seem<br>
eminent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Business &amp; Finance Technology and Practice:</i><br>
<p>
Digital bearer-settlement starts to become more common.  Physical stock<br>
markets are all but empty.  Digital cash companies are still around, now<br>
fighting to get people to accept digital gold futures in exchange for<br>
goods.  Credit cards still the most common way to do business for<br>
consumers.  Real cash is still around, however.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Personal Lifestyles:</i><br>
<p>
You can't get away from the rest of us.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Law and Government:</i><br>
<p>
Areas with smaller governments have flourishing governments; those with big<br>
tax-spend governments have seen their government take MAJOR hits over the<br>
last several years.  NOW privitization begins in earnest, as the government<br>
can barely afford to pay for their services.<br>
