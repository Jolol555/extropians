  IAN: Those measures are of things seen NOW <br>
  relative to things seen NOW. If we measure<br>
  NOW against PAST (in the scenario previously<br>
  cited) we have twice as many valid measurements <br>
  made by each observer, since we are now measuring <br>
  also across time. We thus have the following:<br>
<p>
  The "'" placed after a letter = present time,<br>
  such that "A = A in past," and " A' = A now "<br>
<p>
<p>
 All 8 Valid Measurements Made by Observer A<br>
<p>
(AA') Difference between A and A' =  0 (old-A same as now-A)<br>
(AB') Difference between A and B' =  1 (old-A larger than now-B)<br>
(BA') Difference between B and A' = -1 (old-B smaller than now-A)<br>
(BB') Difference between B and B' =  1 (old-B larger than now-B)<br>
<p>
(A'A) Difference between A' and A =  0 (now-A same as old-A)<br>
(A'B) Difference between A' and B =  1 (now-A larger than old-B)<br>
(B'A) Difference between B' and A = -1 (now-B smaller than old-A)<br>
(B'B) Difference between B' and B = -1 (now-B smaller than old-B)<br>
<p>
<p>
  Notice that in the first 4 we get an asymmetry,<br>
  two positives and one negative, but when we have<br>
  all measurements, we see that net difference = 0.<br>
