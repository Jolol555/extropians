Ready to have an intelligent conversation with your computer? Programs with<br>
personality could become the backbone of the next generation of computer<br>
interfaces. <br>

By John Borland, TechWeb <br>
On the floor of a virtual auto showroom, a customer is intercepted by a<br>
smiling<br>
saleswoman dressed in a red and white jumpsuit. "It's a pleasure to see you,"<br>
she says, as she reminisces about her own racing history and prompts the<br>
customer to respond with information about his or her own background. She uses<br>
this information to recommend a particular car as a starting point for the<br>
shopping trip. <br>
Meet Extempo Systems' Jennifer James, one of the early "believable-agent" or<br>
lifelike characters to reach the Web marketplace. She and other digital<br>
cousins, most of whom still reside in industry and university labs, represent<br>
the latest results of research into making software that thinks for itself. <br>
Believable-agent programs like this are designed to create an illusion of<br>
personality that goes beyond the inflexible script of a cartoon. Programmers<br>
seek to create characters that appear engaging and responsive, although<br>
limitations in language recognition and other technologies still keep most of<br>
the programs frustratingly far from being genuinely lifelike. <br>
Still, the creators of these synthetic personalities have grand ambitions for<br>
their progeny. Programmers in the field predict characters with personality<br>
and<br>
some rudimentary empathy will become the backbone of the next generation of<br>
computer interfaces, both online and offline. The next evolutionary step for<br>
computers is to make the human-machine interaction a social experience, they<br>
say. <br>
"I think it's a question of when, not if," said Gene Bell, a senior researcher<br>
at Microsoft. Bell is working on some of the technologies the company hopes<br>
will push lifelike agents toward commercial viability, such as speech and<br>
natural-language recognition. Once these component technologies are widespread<br>
-- and perhaps integrated into operating systems -- then the spread of social<br>
interfaces will be a natural step, he says. <br>
