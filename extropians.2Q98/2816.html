 No reason both things couldn't be true, information and facts are connected, <br>
 of course you'll need a language to connect the two, but that doesn't mean <br>
 you'll need a human, consciousness or even intelligence to do it. Consider <br>
 the Genetic code, the nucleotide triplet CAU in messenger RNA is information <br>
 and it means something, the next amino acid in a protein a cell is making <br>
 should be histidine. I grant you this is only true in the context (language) <br>
 of life as it just happen to develop on the planet Earth, the Genetic code is<br>
 as arbitrary as any human language. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I actually think that consciousness is necessary for an actual language to<br>
properly exist.  We often tend to speak of one computer communicating with<br>
another, or DNA communicating with cells via RNA.  But this is all just<br>
metaphor.  One computer no more communicates with another than the lightning<br>
communicates with a tree when it cuts it in half.  Both instances merely<br>
involve cause and effect, without any understanding.  To have a language one<br>
must have MEANING and two or more entities who can understand that meaning.<br>
And therefore one must have consciousness.<br>
<p>
I think that we're using "information" differently here though.<br>
