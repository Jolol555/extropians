<i>&gt; &gt;As for the economic matter: automate to the max with as ultimate goal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;free-for-all production of anything, while reducing the population (a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Quality over quantity. That's the *rational* course of action, anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The process of reducing the population is one that brings nightmare</i><br>

<i>&gt; family and raising children is one of man's greaest pleasures..</i><br>
<p>
And don't forget that some of us disagree.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, the only reason that a mere three and a half billion <br>
people appears sufficient for the human population of earth, is <br>
because most of those people don't reap the benefits of living amid <br>
large numbers of free people.<br>
<p>
Once we correct that problem, we'll probably want at least ten <br>
billion.<br>
<p>
And some of us don't particularly want to stay on earth.<br>
