<i>&gt;&gt;am unsure of the type of baud rate that could be accomplished this way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Path loss looks to be the biggest problem here. Scattered laser light will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be WAY down in amplitude by the time it makes it back to Earth from</i><br>
<i>&gt;geosynchronous orbit..</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The path loss shouldn't be insurmountable.  I know that a 3 Joule laser is<br>
sufficient to get a good return signal from the lunar reflectors.  I would<br>
expect most of the loss to occur at the satellite when the laser light is<br>
reflected off an object that was not designed for that purpose.  However,<br>
depending on your choice of wavelengths, even a very low power return<br>
signal may be adequate if you have decent contrast against the background.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you can detect the signal once it's back on Earth, I imagine you want an</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely robust error correction algorithm, as atmospheric distortion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;stray light will be adding lots of noise. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The theoretical maximum baud rate is 1/2 the carrier frequency, so you</i><br>
<i>&gt;won't be seriously limited in speed with a laser signal. The actual data</i><br>
<i>&gt;rate will probably be about 10% of the maximum to give a reasonable S/N</i><br>
<i>&gt;number, and then the packeting and error correction overhead will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;subtracted from that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I assume this would be a packet based system, otherwise you are just doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;a single point to point link?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Point-to-point would be a good start.  I was thinking of ways to set up a<br>
relatively high-bandwidth mobile point-to-point communications link without<br>
having to rely on RF bands or commercial channels.  A more ambitious<br>
project would be to set up a packet network.  The system wouldn't be too<br>
good for real-time communications, but should work very well for data.  If<br>
you used Ethernet type collision protocols, packet communications would<br>
probably work pretty well.  Every satellite would be the equivalent of a<br>
hub.  The biggest issue that I see is the high latency.  Geosync and back<br>
is not a short hop.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If this worked, it would be an interesting option for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;covert/subversive/etc. communications.  Lock onto your satellite of choice</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and send the data.  Encryption would be necessary, but it would probably be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;difficult to locate the sender, especially if the laser didn't operate at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;visible wavelengths.  The problem I see is the possibility that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;wouldn't get a good scatter off the satellite.  I know that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ground-laser-to-geosync works because my mother used to work in a building</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;where data was transmitted that way, but I am unsure how the downlink</i><br>
worked.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It would be impossible to locate the sender from the ground. Surveillance</i><br>
<i>&gt;satellites could be easily made to pinpoint such laser signals from orbit,</i><br>
<i>&gt;however. The probability of a short transmission being seen is very low,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unless there's hundreds of such satellites up there..</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Visible wavelength laser uplinks are potentially visible up to 5-10 miles<br>
or so.  The blue-green laser uplinks (financial data) in San Diego, for<br>
example, are visible several miles from the source.  However, burst<br>
transmissions should reduce this significantly.<br>
<p>
My thought was that it wouldn't be too difficult to put together a<br>
relatively mobile (vehicle-mounted?) secure communications system that does<br>
not rely on commercial channels.  Setting up such a communications system<br>
is non-trivial, but doesn't rely on exotic technologies either (lasers,<br>
detector optics, and maybe GPS if you are mobile) so it should be do-able,<br>
assuming that there are no serious problems with the design.<br>
