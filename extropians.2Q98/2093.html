<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a) Your customers, if caught with the illegal copies in their posession, will be arrested and prosecuted. Their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; arrest and prosecution will be publicized in the media, thus generating a deterrent effect in the public that</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; b) nothing is totally anonymous. Anything on the net can be traced. As for your arguments about the cost of</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; the cost of IP enforcement, at least in regards to web commerce. I think that these costs will be reduced enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that it will totally offset, and then some, your imagined 'efficiency' of having no IP.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since I find this scenario interesting, I'm going to run it down step by</i><br>
<i>&gt; step.  You tell me where and how I get caught.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  I license the use of a copy of information you created.  2)  I encrypt</i><br>
<i>&gt; an advertisement and a pseudonymous public key to Dave's public key,</i><br>
<i>&gt; stating that I have a copy of your manuscript available for $0.05.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Only Dave can read this message; Dave has agreed to broadcast e-mails</i><br>
<i>&gt; which are sent to him via USENET. After enrypting it to Dave's key, I then</i><br>
<i>&gt; encrypt the ciphertext to Carol's key, adding a message requesting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; she send the e-mail to Dave; I encrypt that ciphertext to Bob's key with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; message requesting that he send the e-mail to Carol and send the message</i><br>
<i>&gt; to Bob.  3)  Bob decrypts the e-mail and sends his decrypted text to Carol</i><br>
<i>&gt; as requested.  4) Carol, ignorant of who originated the e-mail beyond the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that they sent it to Bob, decrypts her ciphertext and sends the</i><br>
<i>&gt; remaining ciphertext to Dave. 5)  Dave decrypts the e-mail, ignorant of</i><br>
<i>&gt; its author, and broadcasts it to USENET.  6)  Zed reads this message and</i><br>
<i>&gt; decides to post $0.05 in anonymous money encrypted to my public key along</i><br>
<i>&gt; with his own public key; he does so through a similar chain of anonymous</i><br>
<i>&gt; remailers; no one but the first in the e-mail chain even knows who Zed is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no one but me knows what the message says, because Zed encrypted the</i><br>
<i>&gt; e-mail to me before sending it along the chain.  7)  I encrypt a copy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your manuscript to Zed's public key and broadcast it anonymously.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In this way, Zed and I can conduct a trade perfectly anonymously.  If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; remailers do not keep a copy of the e-mail which they forward (they</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't), then it is impossible to trace either myself or Zed.</i><br>
<p>
Correct, however, when you purchased your copy from me, I included your public key in its coding, such that if the copy<br>
of your key in my software is removed or altered the software is unusable, and my software has virii built into it to<br>
cause other fine fun things if you try to alter the virii or the code which protects the software with your public key.<br>
THus, you may be able to use the scheme above to copy and distribute pirated versions of my software anonymously, but<br>
since the copies all have YOUR public key embedded in them, i.e. your digital fingerprint, all it takes is ONE of those<br>
recipients of the software to slip up, say, their computers get seized in a drug bust, a hacker bust, or the recipient,<br>
living in a libertarian anarchy, winds up with his computer being stolen, then later seized by a PPA busting the theft<br>
ring, and scanning the computer, finds YOUR public key in the software. They notify me that they found a computer with<br>
my software with your public key on it. If this happens once, you could get away with it. Twice and you are busted.<br>
Three times and my PPA raids your property to serve a search warrant approved by your PPA under the joint operating<br>
agreement my PPA has with your PPA (and if they are the same PPA, they don't obviously need to do that, the can just<br>
raid you for violating your contract with them.....). We then find out how many times your personal bank has received<br>
anonymous 5 cent pieces digitally, and I bill you my $50 licensing fee for the 5,347 copies of my software you sold.<br>
Because you sold so many, I might give you a quantity discount I give to all of my retailers, but I doubt that it would<br>
help much....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What are you going to do about this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But you are talking about a market. Markets are not markets of brand names, but of product types. The cola market</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is not the Coca-Cola market, or the Pepsi market, but the cola market. Both have different recipes for cola,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which are protected by patent, both compete to satisfy the public demand for colas with different products. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cannot say that Coca-Cola has a monopoly on the cola market. Thus my assertion that a patent is not a monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stands.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, let me put it to you this way:  any economist who knew anything at</i><br>
<i>&gt; all about microeconomics would agree that Coca Cola charges more for Coke</i><br>
<i>&gt; than it would if anybody could make Coke, and that this is because it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the only company that makes Coke.  They would also agree that increased</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices lead to decreased quantity.  They would agree that this decreased</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantity coupled with increased prices would represent deadweight loss, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic inefficiency, and that all else being equal this will drag down</i><br>
<i>&gt; the macroeconomy.</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily. If a product costs x amount to produce, and given an acceptable profit margin, a company would need to<br>
charge, say, $50 for something, yet its demand curve for a competitive market would cause the retail price to be $25, I<br>
could not bring my product to market if anyone at all could just copy it. Preventing a product from coming to market at<br>
all is its own inefficiency.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you don't want to call this a monopoly, that's OK with me, but please</i><br>
<i>&gt; excuse me if I agree with the textbooks on this point.</i><br>
<p>
I've read the textbooks too, sir, and they say you are wrong. The definition of a monopoly applies solely  to product<br>
type markets, not markets for individual brand names. The soft dring market will divide down to the special market for<br>
colas, in which several brand names with recipes with slight differences compete. There are colas which sell for half<br>
of the price of Coke, yet do not command the same market share as Coke does. Use of brand names is legally protected,<br>
not as a matter of IP, but of fraud. Lets say that there was no Coke.<br>
<p>
There are a large number of colas that compete on the market. I make a cola called Mike Lorrey's Cola, bottled in<br>
Lebanon, NH. The cola happens to have a distinct DNA marker in it that matches with the DNA in my semen cells. THis is<br>
the fingerprint that identifies the cola as produced by me. Slick Danny Fablich decides that he likes the market share<br>
my cola has, and decides to produce a cola that he labels Mike Lorrey's Cola, bottled in Lebanon, NH.<br>
<p>
I can sue him for a number of things which have absolutely nothing to do with my IP rights to my product recipe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; So you are for treating IP as a commodity. Any commodity market is going to trend toward an oligopoly situation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as economies of scale push smaller producers out or up in the market. Why is this? Because in the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; internet commerce, bandwidth is discounted for large users, and hardware like servers, routers, drive systems, CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; writers, etc. are all cheaper on a per kilobyte basis the larger capacity you go.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you saying that it would be a natural monopoly?  If so, since when are</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarians opposed to natural monopolies?  Also, I disagree with your</i><br>
<i>&gt; assertion that all commodity markets tend towards monopoly thanks to</i><br>
<i>&gt; economies of scale.  There are lots and lots of commodities on the market</i><br>
<i>&gt; that aren't monopolistic, never have been and don't look like they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; about to become monopolistic in the near future.  The existence of such</i><br>
<i>&gt; markets disproves your assertion that all commodity markets have this</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior, though it may nonetheless be true for IP.</i><br>
<p>
All commodities which are produced in a manner  or method which allows for economies of scale, will in a matter of<br>
time, move toward monopolistic/oligopolistic markets. Any product in which the combined fixed and variable costs cause<br>
the marginal cost curve to become asymtotic to a Y axis value, become flat, or sloped downward will trend toward<br>
monopolies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In this scenario, the small home grown inventor is discouraged from becomeing a player in the market, unless they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are a rich bachelor who expects to get ripped off by the big boys, playing it off as if they are great</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; philanthropists, humantarians, etc..., or ulness the home grown inventor sells out to the established players in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the market. You are not encouraging a free market, but encouraging oligopoly/mercantilism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you are correct, and it is more efficient for a monopoly or oligopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt; to produce the goods than it is for small producers to compete (or sell to</i><br>
<i>&gt; them), then by encouraging this process we are encouraging a free market;</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is because in the case of a natural monopoly, the free market is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; competitive.  I am not convinced that this is actually the case, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not help nor hinder either of our arguments if you are right on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; point.</i><br>
<p>
Except that once a natural monoply is established with whatever technology is available at the time, it will tend to a)<br>
purposely retard technological development, b) prevent technological developments which do occur from changing its<br>
'natural' status, c) a natural monopoly will tend to cause the spontaneous organisation of statist organizations, which<br>
will threaten the stability of the libertarian society, and will use these statist organizations to help enforce its<br>
continued 'natural' monopoly status.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes it is weird, but your numbers for the present market are not worth extrapolating from as it still is less</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than 0.1 % of the market, yet even if LINUX catches on in the market beyond the hobbyist or iconoclast, companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; like Red Hat will not make any decent level of revinue, until one of the established companies, like Microsoft,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; comes along and modifies the OS into something which it can protect, LinOS II. They then will promote this, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; soak up the entire market, putting Red Hat out of business, or back in the hat closet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most Linux users would disagree; they argue that the reason Linux is good</i><br>
<i>&gt; and growing (some say that it is already better than Microsoft's product)</i><br>
<i>&gt; is because anyone is free to modify the source in any way they want, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are also prevented from protecting their invention under the GPL.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This means that it is easy for anyone with a good idea to improve the OS,</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than wait for Microsoft to release the next version of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; bloatware.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, if there were no IP laws, information like Linux would make up 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the market, not 0.1%.  Remember, I'm not trying to say that Linux is</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to beat Microsoft in today's market; I'm just saying that Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; continues to improve despite the fact that nobody can protect their new</i><br>
<i>&gt; Linux code.  This flies in the face of your assertion that if inventors do</i><br>
<i>&gt; not receive royalties on their inventions, they will not invent.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; will invent, only slower.</i><br>
<p>
And the people who do the inventing will be indviduals will other means of material support who do the inventing for<br>
kicks. Just the idea of slowing technological advancement purposely should be enough to make anyone who claims to be<br>
extropian or transhumanist to automatically disavow any support of the anti-IP cause.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It would be a good thing. However I think that your expectation is wrong, and even if it does gain efficiency, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be because the commodity market for IP pushes invention supply into an oligopoly situation, which any self</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; proclaimed libertarian free marketer should abhor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't abhor natural monopolies, nor should any other free marketer. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; the COERCED monopolies that we have to worry about.  Also, I am not at all</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain that the market for IP is naturally monopolistic, and I definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagree with your assertion that all commodity markets monopolize.</i><br>
<p>
Its obvious to anyone who has done inventing before, and actually gone through the work of bringing their invention to<br>
market with a start up company, that given the high capital costs of invention, which when amortized on a per unit rate<br>
on your price/quantity scale will cause your marginal cost curve to asmtote out at a fixed Y axis value, or flatten out<br>
entirely, or even cause it to slope downward, rather than upward. In this manner, a given invention would be most<br>
efficiently brought to market if it is a monopoly product. Failing to protect the IP rights of the inventor will do<br>
nothing but retard the capital supply to invention development, and thus retard technological development.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Considering that the economy is still pretty planned, with most industry still in the hands of Communist party</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; apparatchiks, I think that a) most of its economic growth is from externalization of western IP costs via</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pirating of foreign owned IP properties, and the rest is b) from internal IP that is owned by state industries</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and enforced by party apparatchiks with connections with police or army authorities, or c) small consumer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; businesses, mostly in the service industries, that are privately owned.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think you can get much more qualitative than this analysis, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; was all that I was trying to show.  This is not to say that it is wrong,</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily, but simply that you can't do this quantitatively; you MUST be</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualitative.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yet you claim with a wave of your hand that nicroeconomic efficiency is beneficial for the macro economy without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; showing HOW it benefits the macro economy, WHO in the macroeconomy truly benefits, and refuse to measure the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; effect in the macro economy of the disincentive to invent on the rate of invention, and reduction in productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that results from stagnated technological development.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, figure it out yourself.  The portion of surplus which is above the</i><br>
<i>&gt; price line and below the demand curve is consumer surplus; that below the</i><br>
<i>&gt; price line and above the supply curve is producer surplus.  If IP were to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be eliminated, consumers would gain more than producers would in the copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; market (see <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent3.gif">http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent3.gif</a> ); also, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase in consumer surplus when demand increases is greater under</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfect competition than under a monopoly, while producer surplus is</i><br>
<i>&gt; greater under monopoly than under perfect competition, as noted.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As for how it benefits the macroeconomy, you should know this perfectly</i><br>
<i>&gt; well:  all else being equal, increased total microeconomic surplus results</i><br>
<i>&gt; in increased nominal GDP.  However, this is similar to the argument for</i><br>
<i>&gt; kids drinking milk:  all else being equal, a child will grow taller if</i><br>
<i>&gt; they drink milk than if they don't drink milk.  How much taller?  I cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; say.  All I claim to know is that microeconomic efficiency is better for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the economy than microeconomic inefficiency, but I cannot tell by how</i><br>
<i>&gt; much.</i><br>
<p>
But you also must account for the law of diminishing returns in this analysis. At some point, your kid aint gonna grow<br>
no more no matter how many swimming pools of milk you pump through the fella.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would love to see links or book refs to anything that shows that you can determine the relative size of two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shapes without knowing the quantitative size of either shape. Sounds like magic to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Look, you want a REAL REAL simple example?  Suppose I have a triangle</i><br>
<i>&gt; formed by the points (0,0), (x,0) and (y,0) and a triangle formed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; (0,0), (z*x,0) and (y,0) where z is less than 1.  The latter triangle will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have less area than the former triangle.  I have no idea what their areas</i><br>
<i>&gt; will actually be, but I know their relative sizes on a qualitative level.</i><br>
<i>&gt; No magic, just math. If I know enough about the supply and demand curves,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then I can use the same "magic" on the area of the deadweight loss, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase in revenues as demand increases, and the quantity produced by</i><br>
<i>&gt; monoplists as opposed to that produced under competition.</i><br>
<p>
I can understand that you can see at a glance that one shape is gonna be roughtly larger than another, that is obvious.<br>
What is not obvious at all is how you can purport to just scribble some lines down on a piece of paper as if they<br>
actually are applicable to the real world, without any actual quantitative numbers determining their coordinates, and<br>
come up with a claim of 50% and 40%. If you have no quantitative numbers, what is the 40%, 40% OF??????  40% of nothing<br>
is still 0.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yet you show no quantified relative size.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I never claimed to!  Did you read my conclusion?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and you made claims of 50% on one figure and 40% on another, when you stated absolutely NO numbers from which<br>
these percentages are derived. Pure slieght of hand, sir. WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS YOU GET YOUR PERCENTAGES FROM?????<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All I said was: "To</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclude, if we let A be the area of the blue trapezoid under perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; competition, M be the area of the blue shape in the monopolistic diagram,</i><br>
<i>&gt; D be the area of the grey triangle and E be the cost to society of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing IP laws, then we should eliminate IP laws if D + E &gt; M - A, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; if A + D + E &gt; M."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, since you only count marginal costs, not fixed costs, your chart</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is absolutely meaningless, especially in an IP marketplace, where almost all costs are fixed costs (i.e. R&amp;D),</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; while the marginal costs of reproduction are nil.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Almost nil.  That was the low red line in the third graph.  As for fixed</i><br>
<i>&gt; costs, you're right, they don't show up on the graph, but they were the</i><br>
<i>&gt; central point of my use of those graphs: if the increase in revenues is</i><br>
<i>&gt; greater than the fixed cost of invention, then invention will take place,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if not, then it won't.  This was the principle I set out in bold; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe it is the most robust part of my analysis because it is so</i><br>
<i>&gt; trivial.  If you disagree with this part of the analysis, (and there's no</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why you should: a priori, you could still be right even if this</i><br>
<i>&gt; were true) you'd better provide your OWN graphs showing why mine are</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Because with greater and greater levels of technological development, invention requires greater and greater levels of<br>
capital investment, which mush be amortized in your marginal cost curve. Given an advanced enough technology, your<br>
marginal cost curve could even slope downward rather steeply, rather than upward. A downward slope is a natural<br>
monopoly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Additionally, your measure of efficiency, i.e. the quantity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; made available in the marketplace, is wrong. The efficiency differential  is measured as the change in price</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; times the change in quantity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gee.  Funny how the area on the supply/demand graph is given in precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt; those units: Price times quantity.... SAY!  Wait a minute!  You don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppose it's a microeconomic PRINCIPLE that the change in efficiency is</i><br>
<i>&gt; given by the change in area on the supply/demand chart, do you?  Naw.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't be...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you think I spent all that time harping on about area, anyway???</i><br>
<p>
Great, but get it right. You only claimed that the change in quantity was the measure of efficiency.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Geez.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In addition, you also only use straight lines in your graph, which any microeconomist can easily tell you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; simplistic and inaccurate of a real market. The demand, cost and monopolist market line all will tend to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; S-curves of one degree or another, depending on the product, the state of the art at that time, consumer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; confidence and utility, etc. In a market with such S-curves, the efficiency gained can be reduced or amplified</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over your straight lined graph, depending on how the lines intersect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As you surely realize, I used lines because they're shitloads easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; draw.  If you want to draw out your own graphs using S-curves, go right</i><br>
<i>&gt; ahead.  I'm anxious to see them.  So long as your curves don't violate any</i><br>
<i>&gt; principles, they will show the same qualitative results as mine do.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Because it is thanks to piracy in other countries, it is unprofitable. Since a piracy enforcement agency, whether</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; state monopoly, and must operate within the legal guidlines set by that jurisdiciton, any state that wishes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shelter piracy can make it unprofitable to enforce IP rights. Just as most terrorism and guerrilla warfare is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; successfull without the shelter and support from states outside the zone of conflict, IP piracy is only sucessful</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with the direct participation, shelter and support of state monopolies.of power. Dont' make me label you a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pro-statist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand.  It would be unprofitable to produce tamper-proof</i><br>
<i>&gt; software BECAUSE it is more tampered with in other countries?  Care to</i><br>
<i>&gt; back this up a little more?</i><br>
<p>
It is unprofitable to produce tamperproof software to help enforce IP laws overseas if the overseas countries do<br>
nothing to enforce the IP laws they have in the first place. It doesn't matter what you do to your software at this<br>
point, The state monpolies who get paid off by their domestic pirates will protect their domestic pirates before they<br>
will observe their treaty commitments under GATT. If we lived in a worldwide libertarian society, where everyone lives<br>
in communities with competetive PPAs, my PPA would have joint operating agreements with other PPAs, such that any one<br>
PPA in the world is  only one or two direct agreement links away from the PPA of the guy pirating my software.In which<br>
case, I would be easier for me to enforce my IP rights in such a condition than it currently is where state monopolies<br>
protect their domestic pirates that copy foreign software and other products.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And it is just as easy to have programs written on a CD which automatically run when the CD is accessed. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; how viruses get away with their mischeif. While AV software may be able to wipe a virus on a floppy, a) on a CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there is plenty of room for multiple copies to watch over each other, and b) a CD cannot be overwritten that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; easily.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, all I have to do is build a computer emulator that copies instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of executes (especially easy when we're talking about CDs) and all the AV</i><br>
<i>&gt; software in the world wont help you as I burn myself an identical CD with</i><br>
<i>&gt; all of the AV software intact, and pop it into my real computer.  The new</i><br>
<i>&gt; CD is no different from the old CD as far as the software can tell; what</i><br>
<i>&gt; will the AV programs detect if they are never executed?</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't matter how many times you copy my software. My software is TAMPER PROOF, not COPY PROOF. Every copy of my<br>
software you produce is gonna have your public key embedded in the coding of the software, so if I catch just one other<br>
person with software with your public key in it, I can bill you for the license fee for that person. ....and it will<br>
give reasonable cause for my PPA to seek to have your computer assets seized for independent legal investigation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Beg your pardon?  By precisely how much will the incentive to invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; change?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It can be measured by the percentage of patents issued which are brought to market with the help of measureable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capital investment. Since capital invested in such a risk investment will demand a given return on that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; investment, if the total on investment is reduced by the lack of IP protection to the point that the given rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of return on investment demanded by the capital market will dictate that the amount of money an inventor can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; raise from investors for a given invention will decrease below the point required to bring the given invention to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; market, then the inventor will not bring that particular invention to market. I don't have any data right now, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I am not making any blind guesses (unlike you).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, this is all true.  However, how do you propose to measure the</i><br>
<i>&gt; demanded return on investment on IP in America without IP laws, all else</i><br>
<i>&gt; being equal?  China won't cut it; planned economies don't let this</i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanism work at all.  You've got to use America and all else must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal in order for this mechanism to apply; in other words, you can never</i><br>
<i>&gt; make this measurement.</i><br>
<p>
Sure I can. There are plenty of products on the market which have absolutely no patent protection. Compare those with<br>
products which do have patent protection and you can develop a metric of comparison.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; My argument has been qualitative, arguing that the incentive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; invent would decrease, but not specifying absolutely by how much.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Which is simply a cop out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, go get your data and we'll see how YOU do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And I say that since the supply of inventions will contract markedly, your pricing will not change much, until</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consumer demand outstrips supply, due to population growth and limited resources, and no change in resource</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; utilization efficiencies do to stagnated tefhnological growth. At which point you will have inflation and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; economic stagnation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, interestingly enough, NOT if you are right about that natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopoly thing.  In that case, the big monopoly on invention-commodities</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have an incentive to pay a premium for inventions, up to but not</i><br>
<i>&gt; exceeding the area of the blue shape in my incentive analysis.  Inventors</i><br>
<i>&gt; will therefore have an incentive to invent given by this shape, just as it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is today.  That is, in that case, the incentive to invest is EQUAL in both</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems, as well as the deadweight loss.  The only difference, then, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cost of enforcement; again, the vote in my favor, not yours.</i><br>
<p>
My argument applies twofold. If there is no IP protection, then only big companies will be able to protect their<br>
proprietary information, and out compete anyone who does steal their inventions, due to economies of scale production.<br>
IP protection merely allows any individual to be protected from theft for enough time for the individual doing the<br>
inventing to establish a business that can produce to the demands of the natural monopoly for that given invention<br>
<p>
Seeing as how libertarian philosophy is about empowerment of the individual, IP law protects the right of the indvidual<br>
to create their own monopoly without having to have a huge corporation already at hand to produce and protect that<br>
information. Libertarians should be for a policy which gives the economic advantage of opportunity to the individual<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Meanwhile, even if natural monopoly does not take place, the blue</i><br>
<i>&gt; trapezoid under competition expands when the demand for inventions</i><br>
<i>&gt; increses, so there IS a demand effect on the incentive to invest; again,</i><br>
<i>&gt; smaller, but not zero.</i><br>
<p>
It all depends on the ratio of fixed to variable costs. If for example, my invention takes $10 billion to develop, but<br>
only $0.10 to produce each indvidual unit (like many medicines), the capital costs so far outweight the costs of<br>
production that the marginal cost curve slopes downward, rather than upward. In this case, if the drug can be copied by<br>
anyone with a decent spectral analyser and chemical modeling software, and there is no IP protection, no rational<br>
investor is going to invest $10 billion for a drug, when most of the benefit for the investors capital will be to<br>
investors who DONT invest in the company......<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yet any web server/router/backbone owner will have a contract with an insurance company to protect their assets,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; especially if they have capital leins on the equipment. In a libertarian world, any sane insurance company will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; require that the network asset owner subject himself/herself to the authority of their contracted PPL. Most or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all PPLs will have interlocking contracts of enforcement. Thus you will be able to track anyone on the net that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; vilates your IP contract, and you are covered by your IP protection clause in your insurance policy. Anyone you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; license your property to will have to subject themselves in your license agreement to ajudication and enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of your self licensed IP rights, ergo your PPL can do a network audit on your customers networks, on their ISP</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; routers, etc. In an internet world, the cost of IP enforcement will go down remarkably.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think I see.  So your PPA will go to the PPA(s) of all of those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; reside on my anonymous remailer chain and get them to tell who I am.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem with this policy:  this is effectively key escrow, which has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; proven many times over to be inefficient.  If you have to hand over your</i><br>
<i>&gt; keys when the government/PPA says so, you can't do electronic commerce</i><br>
<i>&gt; securely.  Period.</i><br>
<p>
No. Everyone will have your PUBLIC KEY. That is definitely NOT key escrow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If e-commerce is more efficient than physical commerce</i><br>
<i>&gt; (And there is a great deal of evidence that this is the case,) then</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing key escrow results in economic inefficiency.  So again I fall</i><br>
<i>&gt; back on Friedman's rule of thumb:  if it is economically inefficient, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will not be enforced under anarcho-capitalism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
SInce you will be using your public key all the time, such that credit agencies will keep copies of your public key on<br>
file at all times, when you license my software from me, your public key will be affirmed by the credit agency, then<br>
embedded in my software. Possibly it could be coded such that only a person with your private key could then actually<br>
operate the software.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The cost of invention is sunk, which means that it doesn't change the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; shape of the supply curve.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; your supply curve is higher than the other guy's supply curve, so this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; clearly not the case.  Instead, we see from the graphs that invention is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; only profitable if the increased revenues from invention outweigh the sunk</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; cost of invention; this incentive is smaller than that under a monopoly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; but not zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think that this is a totally bogus claim. You are completely off your rocker here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What?  That sunk costs do not result in competitive disadvantage?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Competitive disadvantage is a technical term which refers only to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply curve, which is really not affected by sunk costs, honest to</i><br>
<i>&gt; goodness; you can go look it up.  Perhaps you meant something else?  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; average cost curve?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Simplistic, basic microeconomic charts, any skilled economist will tell you, have ABSOLUTELY NO RELATION to any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; real world microeconomic scenarios. To make generalizations from a generalization like you are doing is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; height of ignorant arrogance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet they will agree that microeconomic efficienccy does lead to increased</i><br>
<i>&gt; GDP, ceteris paribus.  It's the ceteris paribus which most economists will</i><br>
<i>&gt; catch you on, but since all I was trying to prove is that IP laws are</i><br>
<i>&gt; economically bad for us compared to not having them, microeconomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiency is the perfect choice.</i><br>
<p>
Not true. Since we are agreeing that nicreconomic efficiency is the crux of the argument, we need to to get down to<br>
brass tacks in a quantitative manner before we can decisively determine who is right here. Until then, your ideas,<br>
though interesting, are not credible.<br>
