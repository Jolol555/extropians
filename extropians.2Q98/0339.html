&lt;4. "life-promoting principles and values". I don't know anybody who <br>
would say of his own values and principles that they are *not* <br>
"life-promoting". It sounds like either empty rethoric or, worse, <br>
like a commitment to the anti-abortion, anti-euthanesia stance.&gt;<br>
<p>
Indeed, they wouldn't *say* it because it doesn't sound very nice, but do<br>
they mean it and live it?  You cannot truly claim to be "life-promoting"<br>
and yet allow the murder of the weak, the sick and the old.  To claim to be<br>
"life-promoting" without "a commitment to the anti-abortion,<br>
anti-euthanasia stance" is to live an ugly lie.  Subject, of course, to the<br>
reasonable polycentric options I have previously spelled out.<br>
