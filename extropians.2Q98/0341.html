<i>        &gt;No rationality is used in setting goals, only morality.</i><br>
            <br>
Because doing otherwise would not be rational.<br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;This time difference is a function of the measuring mechanism itself.          </i><br>
         <br>
Time is what a clock measures.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Is the Planck moment constant or is it not?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, but I don't see the relevance to our conversation. The Plank time is a  <br>
function of the gravitational constant (G), the Plank constant divided by <br>
2 PI (h), and the speed of light constant (c). As the names imply these <br>
values don't change so all observes will see  the same Plank time, namely  <br>
[Gh/c^5]^1/2 = 5.38 * 10-44 second.<br>
<p>
The Plank Length is 10^-33 cm, it's the distance light can travel in the  <br>
plank time. As the wavelength of light gets smaller the energy gets larger  <br>
and so does the mass, remember E =MC^2 so M= E/c^2.  At the Plank Length the <br>
wavelength is so small and the mass is so great a mini Black Hole is formed.   <br>
<p>
To put it another way, when time gets shorter than this, or distance smaller, <br>
a singularity is formed and our theories can tell us nothing about what is <br>
going on, perhaps because there really is noting going on because time and <br>
space are digital at these dimensions, or perhaps not. Nobody knows yet if <br>
these values have any physical significance, my hunch is that they do but <br>
maybe they're just an artifact of our imperfect ideas.<br>
                            <br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;I agree that the speed of light being the same for any observer is        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;absolute, an absolute metaphysical assumption.  </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
Yes, assumptions were made, before Einstein everybody assumed that the speed  <br>
of light would change for different observers, Einstein reasoned that this <br>
was not true, and experiment has proven him correct.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I have simply noted that QM and Relativity are not reconciled, </i><br>
<p>
Nobody said otherwise.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and they are not reconciled for a reason that science has not         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;discovered yet.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If a problem has not been solved then obviously new ideas are required. <br>
I don't have those new ideas, nobody does yet, not even Reilly Jones.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They have not discovered it yet because something is wrong with some         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of the metaphysical assumptions underlying the current Kuhnian         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;paradigm </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You know something, I'm really tired of hearing about Kuhn. It's not that I <br>
don't like Philosophy I do, but it's only entertainment. I'm sure Kuhn was a <br>
nice man but such people do not produce new knowledge. Scientists are <br>
explorers, Philosophers are tourists. When I hear a self righteous <br>
philosopher of science make pronouncements with absolute certainty on <br>
subjects he knows little about and in direct conflict with all experimental <br>
evidence, I'm reminded of a eunuch at an orgy, he can tell others they're <br>
doing it all wrong but can't do it himself.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and it is very hard to buck dogmatism when you are trying to suck in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;grant money.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You want dogmatism I'll give you dogmatism. Aristotle used pure logic and a <br>
long string of syllogisms, which fortunately I've forgotten, and concluded <br>
that women MUST have fewer teeth than men. They don't. Aristotle had a wife, <br>
he could have counted her teeth at any time but never bothered because he <br>
already knew the truth, or thought he did. You know that Relativity MUST be <br>
untrue, but you never bother to count the teeth.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I also can't believe that individuals who proclaim themselves to be        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;scientists, promote the Big Bang as science.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Any theory that makes predictions and can in principle be proven wrong is <br>
Science. The steady state theory made predictions too and perhaps you like it <br>
better than the Big Bang Theory, but nature did not, its predictions were <br>
wrong.      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There is a lot of kookiness in science I don't go for. [...]         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Singularities inside black holes   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A singularity is a point where an equation no longer works because values <br>
become infinite. There is absolutely no doubt that our equations do this at <br>
the center of a Black Hole, whether this fact has any physical significance <br>
remains to be seen.<br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;Black holes are just like glaciers, if you want to free up the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;matter in them, just raise the background temperature around them.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, that would only make them larger because the increased Blackbody <br>
Radiation would fall into the Black Hole increasing its mass.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The idea of a space-time continuum          </i><br>
            <br>
Without space-time relativity wouldn't work. For example, the concept of <br>
simultaneity is not absolute, observers will disagree about the time between <br>
two events or even which came first, and they will disagree about the <br>
distance in space between two events, but they will always agree about the <br>
distance in space-time between two events.<br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;I'd go for a space-time conjunction </i><br>
<p>
A what?<br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;The Planck moment is not a variable, not involved in any continuum,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;at least not locally anyway.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Huh? If the Plank Time is real then time is not infinitely  divisible and so <br>
not a continuum.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't just pick on junk physics either</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I've noticed. If you're not the greatest you're certainly the world's most  <br>
certain expert, and on every subject under the sun. Unfortunately absolute  <br>
certainty is a dime a dozen, being correct is not.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If there was one ounce of ontological randomness in the universe,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the universe would be entirely unintelligible.</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Why? Event A is intelligible if we know it's cause B, and that means that if <br>
we find event B in a time sequence we're certain to find event A later in the <br>
same sequence. Some events have this property but I can find no logical  <br>
reason why all events must have it, and in fact the experimental evidence  <br>
shows that some do not.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;biology makes no sense when it takes randomness (as in mutations) to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be some ontological aspect, rather than an epistemological aspect.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Mutation is only half of the machinery of Evolution, the other half is <br>
natural selection and that is far from random. <br>
<p>
Let's see, you say Einstein was a fool and in earlier posts you told us that <br>
Bohr's and Heisenberg's scientific theories about Quantum Mechanics must be <br>
wrong because you don't like their politics, now you tell us that Charles <br>
Darwin makes no sense. Is there any scientist (not philosophers, I already <br>
know you love them) in the last 150 years that you approve of?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Lastly, I can't think of any greater credibility problem that to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;take information as an ontological primitive.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Probably our deepest disagreement of all.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Information has no existence  without a knower and a known.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Without information there is nothing for the knower to know, so he can't be <br>
much of a knower.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It is a common fallacy to say that DNA transmits information,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;without referencing the knower who can translate the information.          </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
It's no fallacy and DNA does have a knower, it's had one for over 3 billion<br>
years, the ribosomes in a cell know the language of DNA and know exactly what <br>
the DNA means.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>       &gt;DNA replication, the thing-in-itself, is not transmitting information          </i><br>
     <br>
            <br>
DNA can not only replicate itself but with the help of a "knower", a ribosome,  <br>
it can duplicate proteins and even entire living organisms.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it is simply molecules bumping around and lining up in preferred         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;developmental branches.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Your posts do not transmit information, they are simply electrons in a  <br>
transmission line bumping around and lining up in certain preferred branches <br>
of the Internet until they reach me.<br>
