<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; U/Ling may arrive but like so many technological advances, I'd predict</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its arrival as a sudden fit of technological evolution, not as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graduated science.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hmm.. Because I'm not a scientist, but an artist, there's less reason in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this statement than you are probably hoping for. I'm saying this based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intuition and a lifetime of growing up around the Silicon Valley/Bay Area.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I've always thought that bold advances in any high-technology are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; result of a synergy of theoretical ideas melding together.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with that, but that doesn't mean some technologies just</i><br>
<i>&gt; appears overnight. Just look at the history of the personal computer -</i><br>
<i>&gt; it was a quick evolution by many standards, but it still took several</i><br>
<i>&gt; years and involved a gradual refinement of the technological synergy</i><br>
<i>&gt; that made it possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; When it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the technology needed to scan the brain, I think it will be the product of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one incredible idea/device connected to some existing technology. I'm sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that you could argue this is graduated science..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You bet :-)</i><br>
<p>
The final step in the technology will be one incredible idea/device <br>
connected to some previously-existing technology.  That <br>
previously-existing technology MIGHT not exist YET.  At least one of <br>
those technologies will be invented for some purpose not obviously <br>
related to uploading, and will exist for several years before anyone <br>
interested in uploading realizes its potential.  It is quite possible <br>
that the final step in creating the uploading technology will involve <br>
the assembly of five or six different pieces of technology, each one <br>
of which has been readily available for more than a year.<br>
