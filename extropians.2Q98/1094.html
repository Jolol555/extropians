<i>&gt; From:          Dan Fabulich &lt;daniel.fabulich@yale.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is this relevant?  Because this means that it is wrong headed to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that "work" must always be done.  Wealth must be exchanged for wealth, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth comes from CAPITAL, not work.</i><br>
<p>
More completely, wealth comes from the intelligent application of <br>
capital to other capital to fulfil a desire.<br>
<p>
(If your desire is to have a drainage ditch, human capital in the <br>
form of labor capacity should be applied to material capital in the <br>
form of earth-moving equipment, and the combination applied to <br>
material capital in the form of carefully chosen real estate.)<br>
<p>
However, neither the amount nor the form of the capital dictates the <br>
amount of wealth produced.  That is determined by the desire: how <br>
many people have it and how much wealth they are able and willing to <br>
dedicate to fulfilling it.<br>
<p>
If the amount of wealth produced exceeds the amount of capital <br>
consumed, then there is a profit.<br>
