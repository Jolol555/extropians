Unfortunately, ALL credit and debit cards CAN be used to track one's <br>
actions. Every time you use such a card, a central processor is <br>
updated with the transaction data. All that is needed is for a <br>
central governmental agency to require that all such databases be <br>
accessable from a central monitoring computer. This computer can be <br>
programmed to flag every transaction made on a card issued to a <br>
certain person. It is not really necessary to have a national ID card <br>
to have 'Big Brother' watching you.<br>
<p>
I do not believe that the US government at present has such a <br>
capability, but these records are subpoenaed regularly during <br>
inverstigations, see what they are doing to Monica Lewinski's book <br>
purchasing records..<br>
