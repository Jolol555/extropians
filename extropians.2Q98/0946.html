Erik Moeller:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;OK, let's see whether the poor are fine under capitalism today. It</i><br>
<i>&gt;has been often expressed on this list that the US are "not great,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but certainly the best system there is".</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The facts (I cite from "Fifty Facts about Poverty" by Nancy</i><br>
<i>&gt;Leidenfrost, see <a href="http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/facts.txt">http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/facts.txt</a> for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;complete list together with the references):</i><br>
<p>
*    In 1991, the United States had approximately 35.7 million<br>
     people living below the poverty level.  This represents 14.2<br>
     percent of the Nation's population (U.S. Bureau of the<br>
     Census, 1992).<br>
<p>
Below the poverty level in the U.S. means ahead of 90% of the rest<br>
of the planet, visit a large housing complex like Chicago's Robert<br>
Taylor homes sometime, you'll find the majority below the poverty<br>
line, with cars, color T.V.'s, VCR's, microwave ovens, and even<br>
cell phones.<br>
<p>
*    One in five children (14.3 million) lived in poverty in<br>
     1991, the highest number since 1965.  The majority of poor<br>
     children are white; most have a parent that works; and most<br>
     live outside large cities, in rural and suburban America<br>
     (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).<br>
<p>
There are alot of factors involved in this, one of which is that<br>
many of these are single parent households, usually a single<br>
mother, often the primary breadwinner has abandoned the family.<br>
This points to bad social policy i.e. letting someone else pay,<br>
rather than any failing of capitalism.<br>
<p>
Why anyone so poor would choose to have children is beyond me.<br>
<p>
*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 20th<br>
     in infant mortality (UNICEF, State of World's Children,<br>
     1992, U.S. Data from NCHS, 1991).<br>
<p>
You can't make people not smoke or drink during pregnancy, nor eat<br>
the right foods and avoid the unhealthy crap. You can't force them<br>
to go to the doctor for regular checkups. Again, nothing to do with<br>
capitalism<br>
<p>
*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 17th<br>
     in the world in percentage of 1-year-olds fully vaccinated   <br>
     against polio (UNICEF State of the World's Children Report   <br>
     1993, 1992, U.S. Immunization Survey, 1985).<br>
<p>
Polio vaccinations are free, score one for capitalism, and social<br>
policy. Minus one for bad parents.<br>
<p>
*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 14th<br>
     in life expectancy and 4th in literacy (Howell, B., 1990).<br>
<p>
<p>
I'll bet extropians rate 1st in both. Again other people chose<br>
differently. Eating poorly, lack of exercise, driving cars, all bad<br>
if widely available, but a personnal choice.<br>
<p>
<p>
*    The United States has one of the highest degrees of<br>
     inequality in distribution of income (Smeeding, T.M.,<br>
     O'Higgins, M., &amp; Rainwater, L., 1990). (I have more sources on <br>
     this, if anyone wants them, just ask. -- EM)<br>
<p>
<p>
So what? Some people take higher risks/work harder/just plain<br>
luckier than others.<br>
<p>
<p>
*    The United States has higher child poverty than seven other<br>
     major industrialized western countries (UNICEF, State of the<br>
     World's Children Report 1993, 1992).  The U.S. child poverty<br>
     rate is dramatically higher than those of Canada, Germany,<br>
     Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.<br>
<p>
We dealt with this above.<br>
<p>
<p>
*    America's wealth as  measured by the gross national product<br>
     (GNP) reached  an all-time high in 1990.  Between 1979 and<br>
     1989, GNP grew by more than one-fourth, but child poverty<br>
     increased by 21 percent (Johnson, C.M., Miranda, L.,<br>
     Sherman, A., &amp; Weill, J.D., 1991).<br>
<p>
Same again, already been there.<br>
<p>
*    About half of the Nation's poor in 1991 were children under<br>
     18 years of age (40.2).  Children are almost twice as likely<br>
     to be poor than any other group of Americans, including the<br>
     elderly (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).<br>
<p>
<p>
Huh? half the poor were children? If you're poor and you have<br>
children, they will also be poor.<br>
<p>
*    In 1991, the poverty rate among children in female-headed<br>
     families was 55 percent, more than five times the rate among<br>
     married-couple families (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992). (so <br>
    much for equal chances -- EM)<br>
<p>
Bad social policy, every child has two parents, make them both pay.<br>
<p>
And for those who believe that the poor are not "really poor":<br>
<p>
*    Poor families are less likely to have nutritionally adequate<br>
     diets than nonpoor families.  Children who have inadequate<br>
     diets lag in growth and have more frequent, more severe, and<br>
     longer-lasting infectious diseases.  Inadequate nutrition,<br>
     including iron deficiency (with or without anemia), may also<br>
     affect cognitive development and social behavior, with<br>
     undernourished children being more apathetic (Kotch, J., &amp;<br>
     Shackelford, J., 1989).<br>
<p>
Once again come to Chicago, and watch the poor trade food stamps at<br>
half value to blackmarket dealers for cash, used to buy cigarettes,<br>
booze, drugs, and more junk food. Bad social policy. <br>
<p>
*    Poor children are believed to experience mental and<br>
     emotional problems more frequently than nonpoor ones (Gould,<br>
     M.S., Wunsch-Hitzig, R., &amp; Dohrenwend, B., 1981).  The 1987<br>
     report, Children's Mental Health: Problems and Services,<br>
     noted the relationship between poverty and minority group<br>
     membership and environmental stresses.  These stresses posed<br>
     risks to children's mental health (Dougherty, D.H., Saxe,<br>
     L.M., Cross, T., &amp; Silverman, N., 1987).<br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; self evident again, people who do all of the above are going<br>
to have a lousy family life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What am I asking for? Socialism? Certainly not, although many</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropians still seem to believe that if one isn't a free market</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalist, he must automatically be a defender of the big evil</i><br>
<i>&gt;governments and possibly a potential socialist (or a real one).</i><br>
<i>&gt;These facts just show that a deregulated economy tends to produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;more poverty and inequality than a correctly [!] regulated one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Add automatism to this, and you got the High Tech Middle Ages.</i><br>
<p>
It still sounds like socialism Erik (a correctly regulated one?) I<br>
would appreciate you explaining the difference. I would also like<br>
to know what you mean by Automatism.<br>
<p>
Capitalism &lt;def&gt; n. the economic system in which the means of<br>
production and distribution are privately owned and operated for<br>
profit.<br>
<p>
The problems you've cited seem a result of bad social policy and<br>
poor choices by individuals. Unless you can somehow attribute them<br>
to the above definition.<br>
