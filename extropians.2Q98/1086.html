 Some points of clarification:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; What is true or false knowledge? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: A lie constitutes false knowledge.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A true statement (i.e., a statement that </i><br>
<i>&gt;   maximizes a 100% accurate representation</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of the physical universe or mathematic </i><br>
<i>&gt;   models) constitutes true knowledge.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Of course a true statement A, is A relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to not-A, hence the false defines the true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   If all statements were true, they'd just </i><br>
<i>&gt;   be statements (if in U, A = 100% and not-A </i><br>
<i>&gt;   = 0%, A = 0%). </i><br>
<p>
<p>
     IAN: Here the "A" is applied to the<br>
     attribute of statements, which is the <br>
     attribute "true," and is not applied <br>
     here to statements per se. That attri-<br>
     bute is defined by its not, which is <br>
     "false," just as statements are de-<br>
     fined by their not, not-statements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  In short: A, if and only if not-A.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: This means that in U (universal set),<br>
   A exists if and only if not-A exists. Now, <br>
   one might posit a contradiction by saying <br>
   "Well, if not not-A (if not-A is absent) <br>
   then A, since not not-A = A." Yes, that <br>
   is logical, however, "not" properly de-<br>
   notes the "complement of" and not the <br>
   "absence of." The absence of is properly<br>
   denoted by "zero" or "null." So to express<br>
   the absence of not-A we'd say, "If not-A<br>
   is null, then A is null."<br>
<p>
   People often counter: if A is only if not-A,<br>
   then what about the whole unvierse, where's<br>
   the not-universe? There is no not-universe,<br>
   that this is why the whole universe = 0, <br>
   expressed by the conservation of identity,<br>
   which follows directly from the conservation <br>
   of difference, since identity is difference:<br>
<p>
                    1  2  3  ...<br>
                   _________<br>
                1 | 0  1  2 |<br>
<i>                  |         |</i><br>
                2 |-1  0  1 |<br>
<i>                  |         |</i><br>
                3 |-2 -1  0 |<br>
                  -----------<br>
<p>
    Just as the difference between 3 and 3 is <br>
    0, the difference between All and All is <br>
    0, expressed in the zero sum of the whole<br>
    differential matrix. All things, every unit<br>
    of measure, be it one, an inch, a minute, <br>
    a Newton, a Pascal, an ohm, and so forth <br>
    are the products of differential relation,<br>
    and as such no unit can exceed the simple<br>
    analysis presented in the identity matrix.<br>
    The only identity attributes are derived <br>
    from the relations of different subsets.<br>
<p>
    Everything is a subset of identity, and <br>
    since identity is derived from difference,<br>
    and since difference is conserved, All = 0,<br>
    which follows directly from the fact that<br>
    there is no not-Universe, thus U = null.<br>
