Indeed.  It's a problem.<br>
<p>
HF&gt; What happens when someone alters his DNA to make himself more<br>
HF&gt; like an animal?<br>
<p>
I don't have any problem with that.  DNA doesn't interest me much -- if all<br>
goes as I hope, DNA will soon be mostly obsolete.  (The transition from<br>
DNA-based life to meme-based is a basic element of transhumanist theory, I<br>
feel.)<br>
<p>
HF&gt; Or what happens when he incorporates computer parts into his<br>
HF&gt; brain, or uploads and adds parts of his mentality to AI systems?<br>
<p>
I don't see how this matters.  The human personality is an information<br>
pattern.  The question is: what distinguishes an information pattern that we<br>
morally /care/ about from one that we don't consider to be a person?<br>
<p>
HF&gt; I don't see how you are going to be able to draw the line you want<br>
HF&gt; to draw.<br>
<p>
I don't either.  It seems like we need to find some way, though.<br>
<p>
I had an idea at one time, based on what I said before about an evolutionary<br>
legacy.  If a creature has evolved to have instincts and emotions for its own<br>
survival and reproduction, and if it becomes sufficiently sophisticated to<br>
demand rights, then it should have rights.<br>
<p>
So, most animals would not qualify, since they aren't intelligent enough to<br>
understand "rights" and ask for them.  At the other extreme, you could have a<br>
bush robot 100,000 times as intelligent as a human, but it's only programmed<br>
from the ground up to obey its owner -- it has no "natural instincts" or<br>
emotions for serving its own ends.  That wouldn't be sentient either, though<br>
it could be mightly useful to those of us who are.<br>
<p>
If you took an animal and boosted its intelligence, then it could be a<br>
sentient being, and thus accrue all the rights we normally recognize for<br>
people.  From a legal standpoint, this might simply be an exotic way of having<br>
children.<br>
<p>
Also, if you created an artificial intelligence based on a neural net, which<br>
is "programmed" by a regimen of stimulus and feedback instead of cut-and-dried<br>
rules, then it *might* be sentient.  This is one reason why I find neural-net<br>
research vaguely distasteful.  It could lead to some form of sentience, and I<br>
feel this is not a high-priority goal.  We already know how to create sentient<br>
beings, we've got almost six billion of them.  Do we really need more?  Far<br>
more useful to create intelligent but non-sentient servants, IMHO.<br>
<p>
That was my idea.  However, I've continued thinking about it, and I see that<br>
there could still be some problems.  Depending on how radical things get, we<br>
could end up with entities splitting and recombining right and left in various<br>
ways.  Under such circumstances, it could be hard to keep track of such an<br>
arbitrary definition of sentience, and the system could be subject to abuse. <br>
There's not any obvious /test/ you could perform, short of digging into<br>
their minds and seeing what makes them tick.<br>
<p>
There's also the political obstacle -- I'm talking about a *legal* definition<br>
of sentience.  A legal definition isn't useful unless you can explain it to<br>
enough people and convince them to accept it.  I'm afraid my ideas don't<br>
exactly have mass appeal in their current form.  :-)<br>
