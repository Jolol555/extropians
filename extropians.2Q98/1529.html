Not quite - largely (I think) because the conditions are not at all alike.<br>
A truly huge amount of lottery guessing, as I mentioned, is stereotyped and<br>
repetitive (not only selection of birthdays, but blatant patterning such as<br>
filling in vertical, horizontal,or slanted lines of numbers, and crosses).<br>
While there is also a tendency for that kind of routinisation to occur in,<br>
say, ganzfeld or free response psi experiments, those formats are far more<br>
open to novelty.  A standardised lotto form provides a ready-made template<br>
for locking in die-stamped responses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Presumably they found some</i><br>

<p>
Indeed.  This is all in the literature.  Dean Radin's book, despite its<br>
simplifications and a certain broad church inclusiveness that worries me,<br>
offers good, brief outlines of the main findings, with endnotes leading to<br>
the original papers.  Of course, even university libraries tend not to hold<br>
the Journal of Parapsychology, Journal of Scientific Exploration, and other<br>
peer-reviewed outlets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Was your sample set large</i><br>

<i>&gt;were present in your lottery participants?</i><br>
<p>
Yes and no.  On the one hand, a pool of getting on for a thousand million<br>
guesses looks likely to be contaminated by psi effects, even against the<br>
constraints of patterned biases.  On the other hand, these were chunked<br>
into only 20 draws.  I'd like to see a couple of year's worth of draws<br>
normalised and compared.<br>
