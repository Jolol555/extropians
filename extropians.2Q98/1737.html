<i>&gt;I think that there's a different level of poverty that is growing</i><br>
<i>&gt;in our society. Spiritual or mental poverty appears to be on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rise. The worst cases I have heard of are in the CHA's high rise</i><br>
<i>&gt;slums in Chicago. These places tend to collect the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;impoverished people the world has ever seen. They have heat,</i><br>
<i>&gt;electricity, plumbing, TVs, phones, mail service, public</i><br>
<i>&gt;education, elevators (when they work), cars, public</i><br>
<i>&gt;transportation, free medical clinics, and welfare payments.</i><br>
<p>
I have to disagree with this, almost any rural poor area is much<br>
worse off than CHA residents. Besides heat, electricity, plumbing,<br>
color T.V's, phones, mail, public education, elevators (more on<br>
that in a moment) cars, public transportation, free medical<br>
clinics, and welfare payments, these building have a very high per<br>
capita on "luxury" items like VCR's, cell phones, microwave ovens<br>
etc. All of which you won't find among rural poor.<br>
<p>
The elevators, the number one reason (two and three as well)<br>
elevators are broke in CHA buildings is because of the RESIDENTS,<br>
the kids get in the shafts and rig them to ride up and down like<br>
amusement park rides, the gangs get in and sabotage them so people<br>
have to take the stairs and are easier to rob.<br>
<p>
My former roommate was a CFD paramedic and used to take a bag of<br>
our rock climbing gear with him on every shift, he ended up<br>
rescuing two to three kids a week from these shafts.<br>
<p>
Another friend was the elevator repair man for one of these<br>
complexes, he used to take polaroids of the destruction every time<br>
he serviced the elevators, then a second picture of the repaired<br>
mechanism. He said it was not unusual to be fixing the same<br>
elevators every day. The city took my friends company to court a<br>
few years ago trying to charge them with fraud and improper<br>
maintenance. My buddy's thousands of photos and meticulous record<br>
keeping saved the day. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't believe this rise in 'poverty' has anything to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;wealth and its' distribution. I think it has everything to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the way our government has handled traditional poverty. The 'war</i><br>
<i>&gt;on some drugs' is a prime candidate for blame here, as is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;welfare system.</i><br>
<p>
I partly agree that the welfare system is to blame as are various<br>
Govt programs, even though well intentioned. The real blame goes to<br>
a complete lack of personal responsibility.<br>
