<p>
I'm sure Ian will send back a rather lengthy reply, but the long and the<br>
short of it is this:  If I ask who Alex is, and I get back the answer<br>
"Alex is Alex," I will not really have learned anything.  If I get the<br>
response "Alex is like Ian, only with the following differences:" then I<br>
get a far more complete answer.  What we conclude is that we have to know<br>
something about what you are not in order to have any idea as to what you<br>
are.  If you and Ian were the only two entities in the universe, then on<br>
some level you would have an identity only by virtue of the fact that you<br>
differed from Ian. <br>
<p>
This is clearest when used in terms of color.  If everything in the whole<br>
universe were red, then you couldn't really define red in any meaningful<br>
way.  However, you could do so if there were OTHER colors, in which case<br>
you might get an idea of what red is by examining the ways in which it is<br>
different from the other colors. <br>
<p>
nb, Ian is also somewhat liberal with his use of the logical operators. <br>
When he says "=", he probably doesn't mean the "=" to which you're<br>
accustomed.<br>
<p>
&lt;shrug&gt;  Take it or leave it.<br>
