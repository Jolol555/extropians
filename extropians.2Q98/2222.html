<p>
As Max mentioned in another mail, I original discussed the basics of what<br>
is now know as 'NodeNet' with Greg Burch some time ago. To answer your<br>
question perhaps I should describe the bases for my thinking at that time,<br>
and the direction in which I saw ExI progressing. (At this point I should<br>
say that I am in no position to dictate the progress of ExI, but that I do<br>
have an interest in its continuing success, since its possible 'products'<br>
may help me in my own goals regarding the future.)<br>
<p>
ExI seems to be an institute which brings together people with a strong<br>
desire to shape their own futures, and those of the world(s) which they<br>
hope to inhabit. However, as I once mentioned in an article which Steve<br>
Edwards contributed to 21C, the people who will have access to the sorts of<br>
technologies which we seek in order to enhance our lives, will be those who<br>
are very rich, very well-connected, involved in the initial research<br>
themselves, or any combination thereof. Whilst ExI serves to analyse and<br>
propagate the memes of researchers, economists, etc., it is not, in<br>
general, part of the 'meme-set' of those people on whose work and thinking<br>
it comments. There is a disjuncture between 'us' and 'them', in other words.<br>
<p>
One has therefore to ask oneself, 'Whither ExI'? In an ideal world, ExI<br>
would sponsor research of its own, working with the greatest innovators of<br>
this and the next century. But those innovators ask themselves precisely<br>
the question you raise, Michael: what's in it for me? I put forward the<br>
idea of NodeNet to try and answer that question.<br>
<p>
At this point in time, when ExI's revenues cannot support self-funded<br>
research, I would say that it is the multi-disciplinary nature of ExI which<br>
could most enhance people's communication processes through NodeNet. I<br>
remember commenting that any posting member of a node should also,<br>
automatically, be able to browse the other lists, applying for posting<br>
access if and when s/he feels s/he has something to contribute. Put simply,<br>
the key to success here is not the individual 'nodes', but the wider 'net'.<br>
<p>
Is this a big draw to scientists, economists, etc.? Right now, probably<br>
not, and I should imagine that initial progress will be slow. But with<br>
appropriately targetted marketing, and free memebership for key<br>
individuals, at least initially, the rate of take-up should increase. <br>
<p>
I suppose my vision of ExI is one of a real-time 'Nature': prestigious,<br>
multi-disciplinary and highly valued by its target community. In order to<br>
facilitate this, it may be necessary to restructure ExI itself, to provide<br>
a forum for 'lay members' and a forum for 'specialists'. The former are<br>
kept abreast of developments, and on-going work, whilst the latter,<br>
initially joining for communication purposes, are naturally guided in<br>
directions desirable to Extropian Principles by their contact with ExI.<br>
<p>
If this all sounds elitist and grandiose, that is because it is precisely<br>
those things. It is the basis for the development of ExI to gain<br>
recognition along the lines of the Nobel Institute. It will require time,<br>
money and dedication. But if, after time, one can approach any of the top<br>
hundred thinkers on this planet, the Hawkings and Clarkes and Watsons and<br>
Cricks of the world, and ask, successfully, to see their ExI membership<br>
cards, then it is worth it.<br>
<p>
Time to put my money and time where my mouth is. Max: please mail me<br>
details of how I can join the Institute, and my credit card number shall be<br>
yours. If you need my time to come up with necessary marketing plans, cost<br>
analysis, schedules, resource requirements, contact lists, etc., you have<br>
it. I may be able to fly out to the US later this year, if necessary.<br>
<p>
And for those of you who see money as the solution, then rest assured some<br>
revenue generation planning would form part of the grand scheme. (Natasha:<br>
in all that I have said above, I include all forms of artistic endeavour<br>
within the NodeNet paradigm, although doing so may require some form of<br>
separation of forums as far as marketing is concerned, but not in actual<br>
operation.)<br>
