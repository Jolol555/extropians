<i>&gt;	Something that has always puzzled me about Marxism... whence the</i><br>

<i>&gt;quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes speech, or what?</i><br>
<p>
Ideology and philosophy is not just a bunch of positions (well, maybe some<br>
forms are:).  Instead, people have certain core beliefs and methods and<br>
these together lead to the positions like "collectivizing... the means of<br>
production," laws against using drugs, freedom of expression, etc.  Even<br>
with this, lots of people support a particular ideology for reason other than<br>
its core methods and assumptions.<br>
<p>
The reason Marxism caught on so well in Russia was not that the proverbial<br>
man in the street agreed with dialectical materialism, but merely because it fit<br>
better into his worldview than did the known alternatives at the time.  Marxism<br>
seemed to promise a better society to him.  He did not look at all the<br>
alternatives -- there were no libertarians in Russia at the time, at least, none<br>
with any large audience -- just the ones he'd heard about and felt were viable.<br>
The two main ones during the Civil War were Marxism and loyalism.  The<br>
former merely fit better than its rival into most people's belief system -- or<br>
those who disagreed with it weren't able to come up with a popular enough<br>
alternative to keep people at the barricades.  (Often ideologies win by<br>
default.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	For that matter, to me the thesis-antithesis doctrine begs the</i><br>
<i>&gt;question:  "won't the opposites of communism and capitalism therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt;synthesize into a mixed-market economy?". Another vulnerability they've</i><br>
<i>&gt;introduced into their ideology for no reason I can see is the assertion</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the victory of communism is an inevitable culmination of unstoppable</i><br>
<i>&gt;historical forces... BUT as soon as communism wins history will come to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;screeching halt and nothing further will ever evolve. Now certainly nukes</i><br>
<i>&gt;made that a distinct possibility toward the end, but I don't think that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;what Marx meant. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what Marx meant after all these years.  However, I think he<br>
believed that communism would overcome the contradictions of<br>
capitalism.  (Hegel was more of a welfare statist for the reasons you<br>
give.)  I believe he thought capitalism created contradictions while<br>
communism would not.  However, he was not very clear about what<br>
communism would be like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	In short, can someone please explain what the dialectic</i><br>
<i>&gt;materialism meme had to do with the "workers of the world unite" meme? </i><br>
<p>
Historical contingency.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
