Perhaps my point was unclear.  I am not denying them the ability of <br>
speech.  Rather, I am suggesting that, if they do not share some <br>
common referents with us, it would be extremely difficult to decipher <br>
their hypothesized speech; and the common referents are far from <br>
obvious.<br>
<p>
Any technological species we find anywhere in the universe, we can <br>
easily find some common referents with, probably rather substantial <br>
ones.  The classic example being the periodic table of the elements.  <br>
Another culture might rotate it or reflect it, but its basic <br>
structure and the meaning of its contents is entirely dictated by <br>
nature and will be the same (aside from errors, incompleteness, and <br>
local variations in the relative frequency of isotopes) throughout <br>
this universe.<br>
<p>
With cetacea, it is not so easy.<br>
