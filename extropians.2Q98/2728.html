        Beautiful post, Damien.  As I think most list members will agree,<br>
the whole continuing tapestry of life is worth far more than the composition<br>
of chemicals and cells within the body and the brain, and yet nothing seems<br>
to emphasize this more than the present inevitability of death.  So the<br>
question arises: if death is one day conquered, will life be worth so much?<br>
Though this may sound somewhat existential, the question is quite valid.<br>
<p>
        My first instinct is to define all that I find beautiful in life<br>
right now...all the things which I could not feel or experience if I was<br>
not currently living.  Needless to say, that is a lot.  Every sight I see,<br>
every thought I think, every move I make; these are all aspects of life.<br>
When I listen to a song I love, or read a book that moves me...when<br>
compared to the<br>
utter lack thereof, I cannot help but see the utter beauty of these<br>
fragments of pure life.  <br>
<p>
        A major downpoint (in my opinion) in the general views of society is<br>
the tendency to take so much for granted.  This may have something to do<br>
with the tremendous stigma attached to death --the sheer lack of life.<br>
When a loved one dies, the memories always seem to focus on the seemingly<br>
minor aspects of life: things that were perhaps overlooked or<br>
underestimated at the time of their occurence; but such things turn out to<br>
be infinitely precious.  The unacknowledged hug given while one is alive,<br>
becomes an aspect of life, upon death, that could have been cherished a<br>
little bit more.  To know that the immense potential of one's consciousness<br>
--one's own *self*-- has been abruptly quelled by death, seems to<br>
illustrate all the more vividly how much more life should really be enjoyed.<br>
<p>
        Ultimately, this leads to the humanistic reason for extending the<br>
human lifespan.  Logically, the longer one lives, the more time one has to<br>
enjoy his life...the more time one has to create new ideas and explore new<br>
internal and external frontiers --and why not?  I strongly believe that if<br>
everybody cherished their own life more than what they do now, there would<br>
be more respect for life as a whole.  Absolutely nothing on this world has<br>
more value than one's own individual consciousness, and yet so few people<br>
choose to acknowledge this.  Most Christian faiths teach people to blindly<br>
believe in an unproved God, and to await what He has in store for them.  So<br>
how can people love the here and the now if their fates are predetermined<br>
and their earthly lives have no "real" meaning?  No, life is so much more<br>
than that.<br>
<p>
        Every choice I make is my own, and the only thing that can hinder<br>
that is death...the lack of life, and lack of individual consciousness.  As<br>
such, I want to live forever; if I can't live forever, I want to live as<br>
long as I possibly can.  Every day will open up new possibilities for me.<br>
Every second I live presents new thoughts and new options.  Though the<br>
probability of life extension lies purely in scientific exploration, how<br>
that life is used is totally in the hands of the individual.  In the words<br>
of Natasha V. More: "I am the architect of my existance."  Can any words be<br>
more beautiful or true?<br>
