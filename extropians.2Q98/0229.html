The most famous example is Jesse Livermore, by far the most successful stock <br>
speculator of the 20's. He was born poor but starting with nothing made <br>
30 million dollars by the end of the decade, a lot of money back then.  <br>
In 1929 he saw trouble coming and brilliantly sold off all his stocks a month <br>
before the crash. Two weeks after the crash he thought stocks were absurdly<br>
cheap and so got back into the market. He did well in 1930, but then the <br>
market crashed again in 1931 to the lowest levels ever, Livermore lost <br>
everything and was forced to declare bankruptcy. A few days later he put on <br>
his best suit sat down on desk and wrote "MY LIFE HAS BEEN A FAILURE" several <br>
hundred times in a notebook, then he put a gun to his head and pulled the <br>
trigger.<br>
<p>
I invest in the stock market myself and so far it's been good to me, but <br>
sometimes I think of poor Jesse.<br>
