&lt;&lt; This sounds as if god has, for whatever reason, taken a "neutral" stand on<br>
the<br>
 issue. Leaving it to us humans to sink or swim, so to speak.  The flaw i see<br>
 in this is tha this "neutral" god allows his chosen spokespeople to tolerate<br>
 evil, even to promote it and even, in some cases, to engage in it!  I'm<br>
 supposed to believe in a religion whose leaders are corrupt?  A religion<br>
whose<br>
 followers frequently demonstrate their displeasure with a persons flaws by<br>
 killing that person?  A religion that says a person is evil or "ungodly"<br>
 because of a biological difference, weather that difference be a matter of<br>
 skin color, sexuality, or whatever other perceived offense?&gt;&gt;  <br>
 <br>
Well hold on now.  The issue was whether we could reconcile the idea of God<br>
with the presence of evil and not end up with the conclusion that we should<br>
not try to overcome evil ourselves.  It simply has nothing to do with the<br>
particulars of any specific religion.<br>
