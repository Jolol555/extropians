This sounds very similar to fasting (= eating nothing at all). I think<br>
the main purpose of fasting is not losing weight, but "detoxing" your<br>
body, though. According to what I've read on this subject (not<br>
scientific literature), when your body switches off digestion, it can<br>
work on dealing with all kinds of more or less toxic chemicals that<br>
accumulate with time.<br>
<p>
This might make fasting once in a while (maybe once or twice a year)<br>
quite helpful in staying healthy.<br>
<p>
Are there any studies that show the effects of fasting on the body?<br>
<p>
later,<br>
