Please demonstrate me the magical technology which will maintain a<br>
long-term stable fine-grained anarchy for current, average individua<br>
(=hick off the street). The governments and criminal organisations do <br>
not exist because of a whim. Even if you remove them, the ecological <br>
niche will still persist, to be filled with individuals with according <br>
inclinations. Don't fret, predators/prey coevolve to a higher fitness.<br>
<p>
There might be a tendency for the average person to become more<br>
educated with time but it is slow and suffers occasional backslides -- <br>
hence virtual or physical aggregation of individua with nondefector<br>
values may become worthwhile. Trivially but importantly IT<br>
technologies allows e.g. more leisure time for education and more<br>
efficient methods of teaching, implementations of tamperproof currency,<br>
instanteous (tele and face2face) transactions, diverse agent <br>
authentication schemes and maintaining a dealing history and thus <br>
accelerate such a trend. Of course it assumes the ROI amplitude of above<br>
activities to be dramatic enough not to be drowned by random noise.<br>
