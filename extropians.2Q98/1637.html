<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Funny, that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This list, much to its credit methinks, is rife with critical thinkers</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the skeptical variety. Yet, I can't help but cast quizzical looks at</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/btcarrol/skeptic/future.html">http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/btcarrol/skeptic/future.html</a> where it</i><br>
<i>&gt; appears ExI is slated for debunking by the esteemed skeptic Dr. Robert</i><br>
<i>&gt; Carroll.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, if I were Max, I'd seek to force by threat of legal action Dr. Carrol to get<br>
on with it, as being associated by accusation on that page as being loopy like<br>
many of the other things on that page (then again, he also plans on debunking<br>
'flourescent lighting', which would be rather odd, it works, doesn't it?) is bad<br>
enough in and of itself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is worthy for one to be skeptical. Yes, indeed. But it may be equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; worthy for one to be skeptical of the skeptical.</i><br>
<p>
I have found that extreme skeptics can be just as paranoid and psychotic as the<br>
most wild eyed space tripper.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Cognitive dissonance, anyone? :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It occurred to me that I (a first born) have a high probability - on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sulloway's acount - of being narrow, conservative and opposed to change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; My brother Mick, 15 years younger and the family's `baby', should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; turned out neophilic and radical - as indeed he did, in a relaxed and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sardonic way (he's a scathing authority on nuclear tropes in movies and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; TV).  But I sort of muddy the picture, being gung-ho for change in some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; directions and quite narrow and hostile to innovation in many others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sacred cows are to blame. I find I have a much more open-mind to such</i><br>
<i>&gt; Damnable Heresies as Singularity, and Little Machines That Can Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; Everything And More. Things future and visionary make me all giggly. Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; this a symptom of 'a mind so open that the brains fell out?' Certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; not. Or perhaps not certainly not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; /BEGIN ANECDOTE</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My very religious mother and I were having a brief conversation the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other day by way of voice (ugh) communication. We were talking about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal mother/son things (Powers, Dyson Spheres, Great Filters, etc. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the thought crossed my mind that if I were to try to explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech to her, she might snicker like a skeptic in the best case, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; tag me a 'buffoon' for the rest of my life in the worst case.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; She might be right.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, the point is that she has no trouble believing that a wiseman</i><br>
<i>&gt; named Christ went fussing about turning water into wine and raising</i><br>
<i>&gt; folks from the dead (including himself). Furthermore, she has no trouble</i><br>
<i>&gt; believing that after having been killed once, HE'S COMING BACK FOR MORE!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; END ANECDOTE/</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So, the moral of this story is that the more sacred your sacred cows,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the easier it is to swallow the really big pills that relate to those</i><br>
<i>&gt; cows (or at least make it more exciting to believe them).</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Many religionists find extropy/transhumanism to go hand in hand with more<br>
liberal christian transcendentalism. Where you find dissonance is when an<br>
authoritarian religionist understands the libertarian implications of<br>
transhumanism, and the threat they pose to their black and white narrow minded<br>
views.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  (I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one of those people who find it hard to believe anyone except the mentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; infirm would choose  to wear a baseball hat backwards - it mimics baldness,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; never a good look, it leaves you with the sun in your eyes, not a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fun, and it's a marker of herd mentality.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you don't mind, Damien, I'm going to file this one away for future</i><br>
<i>&gt; reference. :)</i><br>
<p>
Depends on what the present utility of the visor is and whether you have someplace<br>
else to stick the hat while you are doing something for which it gets in the way.<br>
I tend to turn it around when I'm shooting skeet, on the first station, so I can<br>
see the high house bird coming out over me....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I suspect this might have something to do with anxiety control.   If your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stress set-points are low, from birth, you might arrange your reactions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the world in a defensive, suspicious way, and if you're intelligent as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; well, you might do this by constructing/adopting highly complex, organised</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; systems of categorisation, evaluation and expression.  More relaxed people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; might find it easier to break free, to explore `imaginatively' without the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; risk of premature closure.  (If that's true, there'll also be more paranoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; delusives - who might seem at first sight to be wildly imaginative - among</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the non-`imaginatives' as well... which is one of the claims in the spoof</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; article.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Neat idea. Some people are convinced that the chasm between neophobe and</i><br>
<i>&gt; neophile is traversible using drugs of some sort. We've had this</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion here before, and I don't know if it was ever settled. Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; Danny remembers?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I've found it to be traversible simply via a good application of reading<br>
and humor, though pot helps, I suppose, though  I think that going through a<br>
stressful period of any kind tends to force the mind to open itself to new ideas<br>
in order to survive, its the old adapt or die instinct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Inventiveness seems to have been a survival trait. Imagination? I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know. Are they different? The starry-eyed daydreamer would have died off</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty quickly, it seems, what with the large predators running about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the savanna 25,000 years ago. OTOH, imagination seems to follow</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence around. Just look at the canonical interpretations of QT.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or Kip Thorne and exotic matter. Who has more imagination than that?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Imagination seems to require the ability to take some unproven things</i><br>
<i>&gt; for granted and extrapolate from there. And is it worth mentioning that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this sounds awfully a lot like theoretical applied science?</i><br>
<p>
Running simulations, dreamCAD, and intuitive extrapolations requires both high IQ<br>
and imagination.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you a later-born, Anders?  Max?  Natasha?  Greg?  Keith?  John?  Anyone?</i><br>
<p>
Second of three boys, with a girl as the youngest child. I'm the most imaginative,<br>
but also have the highest IQ.<br>
