<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "There have been several superficial (aka 'radical')</i><br>

<i>&gt; et. al., but I take these only as a cautionary tale</i><br>
<i>&gt; to balance Heidegger's influence on Gadamer, who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably the most eloquent and thoughtful defender of</i><br>
<i>&gt; tradition in our time."</i><br>
<p>
I wonder if Mr. Szabo mightn't be surprised to find that the radicals have<br>
taken over our universities.  :)  Ultimately, yes, hermeneutics can be<br>
formulated with information theory as an algorithmic analysis of something<br>
which is objective: the authorial intent.  However, many modern thinkers<br>
have all but completely eschewed the idea of authorial intent governing<br>
the meaning of a text; it's their own form of anti-authoritarianism. <br>
Derrida is probably the most historically prominent writer to advocate<br>
this view;  radical though he may be, he is also awfully popular. <br>

<i>&gt; Another very useful but longer article is</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Hermeneutics: From Textual Explication to Computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; Understanding?" by MIT AI Lab's John C. Mallery,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Roger Hurwitz, Gavan Duffy published in The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, Stuart. C.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Shapiro, editor, John Wiley &amp;Sons, New York, 1987 at</i><br>

<i>&gt; .  They summarize their interpretation of this as</i><br>
<i>&gt; follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "In sum, lexical-interpretive semantics differs from</i><br>
<i>&gt; approaches relying on semantic universals because</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning equivalences are determined dynamically at</i><br>
<i>&gt; reference time for specific language users with</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual histories rather than statically in</i><br>
<i>&gt; advance for an idealized language user with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; unspecific background knowledge but who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'semantically and pragmatically competent'."</i><br>
<p>
Or, more relevant to our earlier discussion about hermeneutics and<br>
objective truth:<br>
<p>
"...philosophical hermeneutics is not concerned with verifiable accounts<br>
and, as noted above, it denies the possibility of objective knowledge.<br>
Instead, it argues that only a person who stands in history, subject to<br>
the prejudices of his age, can hope to understand it. A valid<br>
understanding of an event, interaction or text is one that bridges history<br>
or socio-cultural differences to highlight the inquirer's situation." <br>
<p>
The problems with both of these philosophies for capitalism is apparent;<br>
it's impossible to enforce a contract as law if meaning does not<br>
ultimately spring from authorial intent or if the referent of the contract <br>
varies, depending on the reader's background and upbringing.  We might be<br>
able to make a little headway if we were to assert that legal contracts<br>
are necessarily written in a formal meta-language remarkably LIKE English,<br>
a language designed in such a way as to be infinitely more precise than<br>
our own.  However, even this formulation is not without problems, and<br>
doesn't help us to get around the greater problems presented to us by<br>
philosophical hermeneutics, which I think we ultimately must reject if we<br>
are to accept the existence of an objective reality impervious to<br>
interpretation.<br>
