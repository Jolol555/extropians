Title<br>
  Effect on mortality and<br>
  reinfarction of adding fruits and vegetables to a prudent<br>
  diet in the Indian experiment of infarct survival (IEIS).<br>

Abstract<br>
  The effects of antioxidant-rich foods as adjuncts to a<br>
  prudent diet were compared for 12 weeks in a randomized, single-blind and<br>
  controlled trial in 204 (group A) and 202 (group B) patients with acute<br>
  myocardial infarction. There was a significant decrease in cardiac end points<br>
  in group A compared to group B (37 vs 58, p &lt; 0.01) after 12 weeks. Within<br>
  intervention group A, those 108 patients with greater adherence to the<br>
  intervention program showed a greater reduction in cardiac end points (14 vs<br>
  58, p &lt; 0.001), and a significant decrease in total<br>
  mortality (6 vs 28, p &lt; 0.001), including cardiac<br>
  mortality (6 vs 25, p &lt; 0.01) compared to group B.<br>
  Underlying these beneficial effects, antioxidant-rich foods<br>
  caused a significantly smaller rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cardiac<br>
  enzyme in group A than in group B (427.8 vs 561.6 IU/dL), indicating that the<br>
  protective influence of such a diet may be observed within 1 week. The subset<br>
  of group A patients showing reduction in mortality also had<br>
  a lesser rise in LDH and greater reduction in blood lipids, blood glucose and<br>
  blood pressures. Antioxidant-rich foods also caused a significant decrease in<br>
  blood lipids with a lower decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in<br>
  group A than in group B. Assay of serum level of antioxidants and long-term<br>
  follow-up may confirm our observations.<br>
