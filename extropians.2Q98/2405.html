They ARE.  They're BOTH.  Atomism IS holism.<br>

No, no, you misunderstood: I wanted you to quote an atomist who actually<br>
believes in the 3 Laws as written.  To provide a quotation of such<br>
absurdity.  To give an example which is actually given by a real,<br>
honest-to-goodness atomist, rather than your hypothesis about what an<br>
atomist WOULD say if he believed the 3 Laws.<br>
<p>
I bet you can't find an atomist who supports your laws as written; I've<br>
got lots of atomists who agree with my definition: it is atomism by 100%,<br>
and it is also holism.  Can you deal with that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: You said 0 has no ID because the difference</i><br>

<p>
As always, you misunderstand: It has no identity because this particular<br>
number has no difference from zero.  That is not the same as saying a<br>
number has no identity because it is not different from itself; it<br>
specifies a very particular number, the difference from which defines the<br>
partial identity.  0 has no identity because it is not different from the<br>
"with respect to" number, not because it is the same as itself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: And the sum of all difference </i><br>
<i>&gt;   is 0 in one or all reference frames,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as the matrix can be just one frame.</i><br>
<p>
And?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: So relative identity attributes are </i><br>
<i>&gt;   not identity attributes, like "6 is 6 more </i><br>
<i>&gt;   than 0" is not and identity attribute of 6.</i><br>
<p>
It sure is; you list it on your identity matrix.  It's not very useful<br>
(kind of like the universe which consists only of A and B), but it is<br>
identity, even under your definition.<br>
