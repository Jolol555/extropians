Not unless you build them yourself. I'm currently researching<br>
radio modem plans with a view towards building a bundle of them<br>
with about a dozen of my friends, and setting up a city-wide WAN.<br>
The next step is to run this WAN into an internet feed. While<br>
having a high-speed link would be nice, I'm more interested in a<br>
permanent connection than a fast dial-up link. There are some<br>
interestingly fast designs floating around, so hopefully I'll be<br>
able to implement a 100k+ link. I'm in Melbourne, Australia,<br>
fwiw.<br>
<p>
If anyone knows of useful spread-spectrum radio designs, or have<br>
any advice, please get in touch with me, and if people are<br>
interested I'll let them know how this works out.<br>

<p>
I wonder how much use the corel NC will be for this purpose? This<br>
is basically my plan, I'd like to link up my neighbours, and link<br>
these subnets with my friends' subnets. Economies of scale are<br>
quite useful in this regard, and if I'll I'm providing is access<br>
to the net it's a hell of a lot less hassle than running an ISP.<br>

<p>
I've subscribed to this since it started, as far as I know. What<br>
do you mean by the "effort"?<br>
