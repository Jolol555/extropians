<i>&gt;and thus predictable, we tentatively call it truth-like.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I certainly agree with that more that the <br>
   complete divorce of science and truth. However, <br>
   to say that something is "life-like," we have<br>
   know what life is, and likewise, to say that <br>
   something is "truth-like" we have to know<br>
   what truth is. I can't say that X is <br>
   like Y, yet say that Y is unknown.<br>
<p>
   Truth simply is the physical reality, true<br>
   knowledge is  knowledge that has a one-one<br>
   relation with the physical reality. To say <br>
   X is true is to say that X exists or that <br>
   it models existence accurately. Science <br>
   is about truth because it is about the<br>
   physical universe and learning its <br>
   laws, principles, and structure.<br>
