<i>&gt;You weren't listening--yes, there will be less profit from</i><br>

<i>&gt;revolutionary ideas.  Progress comes from small, evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;improvements and combinations of existing ideas, and it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;those that will flourish in a world where there are no</i><br>
<i>&gt;copyrights and patents to artificially overvalue novelty</i><br>
<i>&gt;for its own sake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Have you checked out our web site? Our product, granted, uses existing<br>
technology for it's component parts. The overall idea is what is unique and<br>
revolutionary, and would not have been possible before the development of<br>
modern engine controls on cars. In fact, those controls gave my partner the<br>
impetus he needed to concieve of the product we developed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The myth of the small lone inventor coming up with a unique</i><br>
<i>&gt;and marvellous idea out of nothing in his garage is fairy tale.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A pretty story made up to justify granting state-sanctioned</i><br>
<i>&gt;privilege to those who can afford to speculate irresponsibly</i><br>
<i>&gt;with technology in hope that big brother will secure their</i><br>
<i>&gt;market for them if they get lucky.</i><br>
<p>
Goodyear and vulcanization? The Wright Brothers? A G Bell? None had any<br>
government help until they got their patents. Without the patent, they would<br>
have been raped by some large existing firm almost instantly once they made<br>
their process or product known.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A /true/ creative mind honestly acknowledges that nothing is</i><br>
<i>&gt;created in a vacuum; every "creation" is a synthesis of old</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas from a thousand sources, and maybe one or two randomly</i><br>
<i>&gt;strewn new ones.  I certainly don't think they have no value,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but nor do I think creativity is anything special.  Anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;who thinks a creative mind is somehow more worthy of help from</i><br>
<i>&gt;government than a talented athlete, and skilled craftsman,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or even a high-priced hooker is just a snob.  Everyone from</i><br>
<i>&gt;laborers to inventors contributes to the economy, and none</i><br>
<i>&gt;deserve anything they can't get without a forcible monopoly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree, nothing is created in a vacuum - except possibly interstellar<br>
matter :) What does that have to do with creation being the property of the<br>
creator?<br>
<p>
I never said anyone should have government help. A copyright or patent is no<br>
different than a law against pigeon drop scams and littering. It gives<br>
honest people a tool to recover from thieves and scoundrels.<br>
<p>
The monopoly is short enough in time, and realistically, the life of a<br>
patent is measured in months, not years, before competition renders the<br>
patent virtually worthless. Only in the case of the revolutionary idea you<br>
don't belive in is the patent truly effective.<br>
<p>
Copyright, on the other hand, is protection to the tools of business. A logo<br>
or commercial artwork is no different from a hammer or milling machine. If<br>
someone appropriates your corporate logo, they steal from you as surely as<br>
if they took a machine tool from your palnt.<br>
