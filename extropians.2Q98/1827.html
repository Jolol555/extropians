This is another example of the increasing costs of government; it expands<br>
the economic price window in which an anarcho- capitalistic PPA can<br>
function.  As laws like this become harder and harder to enforce,<br>
ultimately laws WILL be enforced according to economic efficiency.  Having<br>
a "government" in place only serves to create friction in this market. <br>
<p>
Note that you could get around this problem of anonymity simply by passing<br>
a law stating that all commerce has to happen via book entry settlement<br>
using government issued digital signitures, but the cost of such an<br>
enterprise would far outweigh its earnings.  A PPA could save money this<br>
way by charging the same price (or tax) as the government currently<br>
imposes, minus the price window, and then enforcing only those laws which<br>
were economically efficient.  Since the government needs funding in order<br>
to run its business, the gov't would eventually have to shut down.<br>

It's May's Cyphernomicon, which expands on the manifesto and adds<br>
a variety of important details.<br>
