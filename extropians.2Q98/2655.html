In a message dated 98-06-25 13:29:11 EDT, you write:<br>

 <br>
 P.S. Could anyone give me a reference to where one of Heinlein's<br>
      characters makes this remark? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Sure... it is the character "Kettle Belly" Baldwin in the book Friday.  He is<br>
speaking to her ( Friday), about maturity and the need for rational thought.<br>
The point of the passage, and of my post, is that rationality does not offer<br>
the degree of freedom from responsibility that can be achieved by religion.<br>
What I mean is that in a religion one can always put the "blame" for<br>
unhappiness or disaster or misfortune off on god, or the devil, or whatever<br>
other bugaboos are part of that religion.   An atheist hasn't that scapegoat<br>
available.  We have to shoulder the responsibility ourselves.  <br>
<p>
Brent, I'm not sure if you understood what I meant by my post.  I don't<br>
believe in any such thing as heaven or hell.  when I spoke of the "warmth of<br>
religion" I was responding to another members post concerning the comfort<br>
sought after by many religionists.  <br>
<p>
For myself, I think that I do hold much of that childlike wonder you speak of.<br>
I am often amazed and delighted by the world I live in and the wonders it<br>
shows me daily.  The prospect of living for long enough to really explore it<br>
fills me with excitement and helps me approach the day with a bright outlook. <br>
<p>
Don't read too much into the expression "cold light of reason".  I simply mean<br>
rational thought and study, without the need for some mystical explaination or<br>
being.  <br>
It seems that so many people spend their time and energy trying to discover "<br>
what it's all for".  I don't need to ask, I already know..:-)  But that is my<br>
own opinion and it isn't one that i expect anyone else to give a hoot about.<br>
I wouldn't dream of trying to convince anyone else that my reason is, or<br>
should be, theirs.  <br>
I really don't think you and I see things all that differently.  I do think<br>
you have a greater degree of tolerance, or maybe understanding, of<br>
religionists points of view than I have.  <br>
<p>
At any rate, I appreciate your responses and your thoughts on the subject.  <br>
Be well, Cori<br>
