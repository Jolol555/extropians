No problem with devil's advocacy. Please take my responses constructivly<br>
and not as an argument. As I see it, we are exploring the problem<br>
together.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Storing stuff in 3-d gives rise to a large dissipation problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Heuristically, the problem is that the heat generated goes like length</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; cubed (total number of components), while heat dissipated goes like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; length squared (proportional to the surface area).  As I've stated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; elsewhere, the reversible compution solution to this problem has a large</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; potential hurdle to overcome, in the form of heat generated by error</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; correction, which suffers the same probelm re dissipation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I was referring to storage density, not storage speed. Nanomechanical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; storage systems should require no power unless bits are being read or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; written, so power dissipation is a function of I/O speed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay.  There is still a slight issue in that addressing is a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; overhead in storage architecture, and involves dynamics; the same caveats</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the need for error correction apply.  You also better make sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; that your nanomechanical storage is extremely error free.  What happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; if thermal fluctuations flip your bit?  Sure, this would be a rare event --</i><br>
<i>&gt; but you're talking about a scenario where the goal is ~ 10^10 bits or more.</i><br>
<p>
Addressing in a nanomechanical system occurs only as part of a read or write<br>
operation. When no I/O is occurring, no energy is dissipated. Dissipation per<br>
access depends on the size of the memory, O(logN) for random access,<br>
which is negligible and is mitigated further by caching.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Three-dimensional</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; storage in a nonomechanical system, using 100 atoms per bit alllows</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a fair number of extra atoms for "overhead" functions such as support</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and heat-conduction. The energy dissipated to read or write a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nanomechanically should be very small compared to that needed by current</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, it would need to be. Suppose (conservatively), that you are going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have 10^6 layers, each storing bits with a density of 100 atoms / bit;</i><br>
<i>&gt; a storage density of 1 bit for every few nanometers squared.  Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; device will have roughly 10^12 more bits stored on it than current</i><br>
<i>&gt; commerical chips.  I forget the exact numbers, but the dissipation rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; per logical operation is something like 10^6 kT in current chips.  That</i><br>
<i>&gt; means you have a major problem unless everything is done completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; dissipation free.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'm not sure that 10^6 layers is conservative. It's nanomechanically conservative<br>
from a static structural standpoint (i.e., we could build it) but not from a<br>
Moore's Law standpoint. We started this discussion with Moore's law in 2020.<br>
Moore's law ( in one form) calls for doubling density every 1.5 years, or roughly<br>
an increase of 16,000 by 2020. I can get this with an areal decrease from the current<br>
10^6 nm^2/bit to 50 nm^2/bit without going into the third dimension at all. It's not<br>
unreasonable to assume a decrease in energy per I/O on the same order, so I don't<br>
have to invoke any of the other mechanisms.<br>
<p>
If I operate the memory at the same access rate, the size of the memory is irrelevant.<br>
If I operate the memory a 1000 times faster but using 1000 times less energy per I/O, I<br>
have the same dissipation per volume. If I can sustain temperatures 3 times higher<br>
(measured in degrees Kelvin above ambient) I can dissipate 81 times as much heat per<br>
surface area. If my internal thermal conductivity is four times higher, I can<br>
dissipate an additional four times the power, depending on geometry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; and diamondoid should be able to operate at much higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; temperatures than silicon-based devices. Diamondoid is a much better conductor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of heat than silicon, also.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These are good points, but they only buy you a tiny amount.</i><br>
<p>
As you see from the above, these points can affect the densities by a factor<br>
of ten to one hundred or so. By contrast, you raise the issue of error correction.<br>
However, even very powerful ECC schemes require less than doubling the amount<br>
of volume needed to store a word. For example, use 13 bits to store a byte, and you<br>
can perform error-correction on any single-bit error. As the word size goes up,<br>
the percentage of extra bits needed goes down.<br>
