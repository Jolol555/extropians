<i> &gt;Can anybody think of anything more fundamental than information?</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm new to this, so my apologies in advance if I violate any etiquette.<br>
<p>
There are different ways in which something can be fundamental..  We can speak<br>
of whether something is fundamental in a physically foundational sense (what<br>
underlying physical material is making THIS physical material do what it does,<br>
or exist?).  We could also speak of whether something is fundamental in an<br>
epistemological sense (what concept makes the acceptance of THIS concept<br>
logically possible?).  I think that if we examine all the different uses of<br>
the word, though, the pattern that emerges is that something is fundamental if<br>
it is necessary to exist for anything else to exist.<br>
<p>
So with that in mind, information is not fundamental, because for information<br>
to exist there must be things =about= which there can be information.  I might<br>
be misreading how you're using the word information though.<br>
<p>
Is a fact (which is presumably what makes up information) ABOUT something<br>
identical with whatever aspect of that something it describes?  It seems far<br>
more plausible to me, here at the outset, that a set of all the facts that<br>
describe X is NOT identical with X itself.  But perhaps that set and X are<br>
instantiated simultaneously.  The set exists when X exists, and X exists when<br>
the set exists.  Or can the set really only exist if there is a conscious mind<br>
to create it?<br>
<p>
Unless the set of facts are one and the same as X, information is not the most<br>
fundamental thing.<br>
