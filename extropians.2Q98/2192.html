I remember discussing the outlines of this with Greg Burch in a London pub,<br>
two years ago, in the context of how ExI might place itself within the<br>
global scientific and economic community. That discussion thought of these<br>
nodes as being limited in their membership to invited (or at least<br>
'vetted') specialists, and hence carving out a niche for ExI as a global<br>
facilitator of scientific networking and propagation. In that light, two<br>
things occur to me. First, are these lists to retain the exclusivity which<br>
might serve ExI best in the long run, by establishing its credentials as a<br>
world-class organization, or are they to be open to all, hence increasing<br>
publicity, but, more than likely, deterring the specifically<br>
scientific/economic professional community from using the nodes as a<br>
'trading' place? Second, with multiple, highly-specific nodes, how is ExI<br>
to ensure that 'cross-pollenation' of ideas occurs effectively?<br>
<p>
Put another way, is ExI a network for the discussion of popularized, though<br>
sometimes innovative ideas, open to all, or is it to be a community of<br>
multi-disciplinary thinkers, with a proven track-record of academic and<br>
commercial success? Both roles are necessary in the world, but I can't help<br>
thinking that ExI would serve its members more effectively in the<br>
achievement of their goals, rather than the mere discussion of those goals,<br>
if it were to become the latter type of organization.<br>
<p>
One final way of considering this question: what form of organization does<br>
ExI need to be in order to create the future, rather than merely comment on<br>
it?<br>
