Hmm. I sketched one possible solution, that _might_ be feasible, with a <br>
lot of work.  Other solutions might also be feasible, and perhaps <br>
function rather better.  I'd be interested to hear other people's <br>
suggestions.<br>
<p>

<p>
Marketing only works up to a point, and it costs money.  I don't know how <br>
much money has been invested in Usenet, but I imagine hundreds of <br>
millions, at a minimum. Certain key players, such as Microsoft and <br>
Netscape, have invested considerable time and resources in integrating <br>
Usenet into their product.<br>
<p>
Overcoming this initial investment will require some pretty hefty <br>
marketing. I note that Usenet II does not seem to have taken off. <br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Free membership for the best essay written by an undergraduate in the</i><br>

<p>
Thus making it a status thing. That's a good idea.<br>
