Careful, Paul - Dan, of all people, isn't like that.  Some are, sure.  A<br>
few, alas, are blithering idiots who babble whatever comes out their<br>
fingers, usually in a small uninteresting blat they add to someone else's<br>
message without trimming it for salience before reposting.  But Dan<br>
certainly isn't among their number.<br>
<p>
(In this case, it's true, I also felt he probably should have taken a<br>
little longer to work out what you meant.  But I see he's since defended<br>
his reasoning - in his customary polite terms.)<br>
