<i>&gt; ...your critique of utilitarianism in favor of "truth" USES </i><br>

<i>&gt;truth function brings about optimal utility, as you argue, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;by all means we should adopt it; but this is BECAUSE of</i><br>
<i>&gt;utilitarianism, not in spite of it. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Your point is that function = utility.<br>
   But we could have two functions, (1) a truth<br>
   fuction that maps physical reality, and (2) a<br>
   Big Lie function that masks physical reality.<br>
   Both are useful to some, but only one is true.<br>
   If "utility first" is my directive, I can choose<br>
   either; if "truth first" is my principle I can<br>
   choose only one. This limits my options, but <br>
   as a rule it maximizes social outcomes, which <br>
   is utilitarian, but utility comes second.<br>
<p>
   What is more, since there is only one reality,<br>
   yet myriad claims about it, the Big Lie function<br>
   will be useful to most people and thus the demand<br>
   for the utility of BLF will be greater than for <br>
   TF, so if our directive is  "whatever works to<br>
   promote your idea," Big Lies will win the day.<br>
<p>
   When I apply a "truth first" principle based <br>
   up a scientific defintion of truth, I submit <br>
   to a "higher authority" that will judge my <br>
   ideas (about any topic) accordingly. If I<br>
   apply "utility first" then it's whatever<br>
   I can get away with to promote my ideas.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;thought experiment&gt; Suppose you are studying an important effect in</i><br>
<i>&gt;quantum mechanics, but one which can be put off until later without</i><br>
<i>&gt;significant losses in utility.  Then, you look out the window and you</i><br>
<i>&gt;see: A Drowning Child (tm) [the philosopher's favorite play toy!]. </i><br>
<i>&gt;You could save that child now and study quantum effects later, </i><br>
<i>&gt;OR you could just ignore the child and continue the pursuit of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;one-to-one truth function.  Despite the fact that utilitarianism demands</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you save that child, truth-first demands that truth comes first, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;utility second.  You ignore the child, and finish observing your quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect before even considering saving him/her. &lt;/thought experiment&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: An interesting dilemma, but I think it <br>
   may be a false dilemma. Maybe I cannot swim,<br>
   and I have no rope, or just don't care, so<br>
   saving the drowning child is not useful to <br>
   me, afterall, that kid was a real nuisance.<br>
<p>
   So it doesn't follow that utility dictates <br>
   that I stop my work and save the child.<br>
<p>
   But if I have an axiom, "All human life is <br>
   sacred," and I see a life in eminent peril,<br>
   I say "I believe that axiom is true, thus <br>
   I must stop my work and save that child." <br>
   It seems to me that the act of stopping my<br>
   work to save another must rest on a truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The Nazi Party found the extermination of all who </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; disagreed with their agenda very useful and adhered</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; faithfully to the utility-first principle that many </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on the ExI list adhere to. Does ExI = Nazism? I say </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; no! I believe it is not the right ExI principle. I </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; believe that to the extent we are directed to that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; principle we are infected with totalitarian memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To this I answer:  Do you honestly believe that WWII was the best thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;that could have happened to Germany?  Wouldn't the German government be</i><br>
<i>&gt;leaps and bounds better off if that whole little fiasco had never</i><br>
<i>&gt;happened?  Besides, think about all the "Einsteins" which Germany COULD</i><br>
<i>&gt;have kept, but lost thanks to the Nazi holocaust!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: It is TRUE that Germany would be better off <br>
   if they did not start WWII and commit mass murder.<br>
   It was useful for the Nazis to mask that truth, <br>
   for their goals were not making Germany better<br>
   but enemy extermination and global conquest.<br>
