What you have to lose is whatever the cost of converting the current<br>
system into an anarcho-capitalist system is.  Don't get me wrong, if you<br>
found this magical way of making the world an anarcho-capitalist arena,<br>
i'm right behind you, but i don't see the point in striving for some<br>
almost-unatainable system which i think is likely to naturally degrade to<br>
the present system.<br>

<p>
They are both likely to be false due the same reason: you prefer the other<br>
PPA because you are going to pay less than you do now, which means that<br>
the potential profit for that other PPA is lower than the current profit<br>
of your current PPA, which means that your current PPA will spend more<br>
money keeping you than the other PPA will in trying to "free" you.<br>
