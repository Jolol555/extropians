AN elephant's bones are near the tolerance limits for those bone designs using<br>
those bone materials. A Giraffe exerts much more stress on its neck bones than<br>
an elephant does on any of its own. That a giraffe's neck is engineered like a<br>
cantilevered truss is much more of a natural engineering feat than the shock<br>
absorbing capabilities of the elephant. The reason why dinosaurs that we know<br>
popularly (most were actually quite small) are so big is that they developed at<br>
a time when all or most of the continents were part of the Pangea super<br>
continent. Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between the<br>
evolved sizes of animals and the size of the land mass which they inhabit. For<br>
example the wooly mammoth, of which frozen remnants have been found in the<br>
tundra of Siberia, which was larger than the elephant, and carried much more<br>
mass in its tusks than current elephants, as it was slowly killed off by post<br>
ice age man, the last refuges in which its fossils were found to have lived most<br>
recently ( from what I've heard as recently as 4000 BC) were small islands in<br>
the arctic ocean north of Finland. As their food supply was restricted by the<br>
size of their domain as it was cut off from the mainland by rising seas, they<br>
slowly evolved into a 'mammoth' of only 3 or 4 feet in height.<br>
