<p>
This is valid.  I think you still accept axiom 1 with the provisions<br>
provided; I think you would agree that force is possible if and only if the<br>
coerced are not under control in the given situation.  However, you contend<br>
that 2 and 4 are false, and therefore conclusions 3 and 5 are unsound.<br>
Since 2 is less defensible than 4, I'll leave 2 alone for the time being<br>
and focus on 4.<br>
<p>
It is difficult, if not impossible, for me to demonstrate my ability to<br>
choose what I believe.  After all, I could TELL you that I believe<br>
something differently, but how would you know it empirically?  However, I<br>
seem to be able to demonstrate my control over whether I listen to<br>
something or not by, say, turning on or off the television, or by<br>
observably listening or not listening to someone else.<br>
<p>
However, this is not a sufficient demonstration.  I think we both take it<br>
as an axiom that I am only capable of exercising this form of "control" if<br>
I WANT to do so, and I presume that you would argue that my desires are NOT<br>
under my control.  I may listen or not listen only as my desires dictate,<br>
and my desires may be given by circumstances beyond my control.<br>
<p>
In this case, I think we are arguing about different definitions of<br>
control.  I would say that the ability to choose between alternatives<br>
according to my desires is a suffficient condition to say that I control my<br>
decision.  You would disagree, arguing that I do not control my desires,<br>
and it is my desires which dictate my decision; therefore, I do not control<br>
my decision.<br>
<p>
I will assume, for the purposes of discussion, my definition of "control,"<br>
which I will set in quotes because it is obviously not agreed upon.<br>
<p>
- From a utilitarian moral standpoint, I put forward that "coercion"<br>
(which, according to axiom 1, is characterized by a lack of "control") is<br>
important because people are made fundamentally better off when they get<br>
what they desire, and that "coercion" restricts what people are able to get<br>
for themselves.  However, if we assume your definition of control, then<br>
coercion has an ambiguous effect on a person's well-being, even from a<br>
utilitarian standpoint.  Coercion is not necessarily wrong, if we accept<br>
your definition.<br>
<p>
I put forward that under your definition, the atheist IS coercing the<br>
believer; but that this is irrelevant from a moral standpoint, because<br>
coercion is not necessarily wrong.  Whereas, under my definition,<br>
"coercion" is necessarily wrong, but the atheist is not "coercing" the<br>
believer.<br>
<p>
So we can choose one of either:<br>
<p>
A<br>
2.1)  Axiom.  Reducing the well-being of others is morally wrong.<br>
2.2)  Axiom.  A person's well-being is reduced when they cannot get what<br>
they desire.<br>
2.3)  Definition.  Coercion prevents people from getting what they desire.<br>
2.4)  Therefore.  Coercion is morally wrong.<br>
<p>
OR<br>
<p>
B<br>
2.1)  Axiom.  Reducing the well-being of others is morally wrong.<br>
2.2)  Definition.  Coercion does not reduce the well-being of others.<br>
2.3)  Therefore.  Coercion is not necessarily morally wrong.  <br>
<p>
Either way, what the atheist is doing is not morally wrong, and that's what<br>
I had originally intended to prove anyway.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe the word 'leader' is too strong. I meant to imply that people have</i><br>
<i>&gt;centered around Max and his ideas, many of these people absorbing these</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas without deeper consideration (they cannot consider them, because</i><br>
<i>&gt;criticism of the basic ideas is forbidden on this list, and with whom should</i><br>
<i>&gt;they discuss them if not with the Extropians themselves?).</i><br>
<p>
Other people on other lists; alternately, HERE, to some degree.<br>
(Particularly if we implement that ANTI:  tag...  Eh?  Anybody?)  Note that<br>
criticism IS happening as we speak.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I did NOT mean to</i><br>
<i>&gt;imply that you are all following Max and his 'orders' sheepishly and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;apologize if it has been understood this way. The right expression is</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably 'guide', not 'leader'. Would you agree that Max More has been a</i><br>
<i>&gt;guide for you?</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps, but I have an awful lot of guides in this world.  For example, I<br>
had not previously considered the above argument before you made it.  My<br>
first reaction was simply to presume that I could demonstrate that you were<br>
wrong by not listening to something.  However, upon deeper reflection, I<br>
realized that you had a deeper point, one which was not so easily<br>
disproved.  To some extent, I consider you a "guide," for this evening, by<br>
helping me to rethink the question in a way which I had not considered it.<br>
<p>
So, yes, I'd say that Max More has been a "guide" for me.  However,<br>
considering that you have also been a "guide," this isn't really a<br>
particularly strong claim.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I look at the discussion policy here, I get an opposite view. Your</i><br>
<i>&gt;fundamentals are considered as being simply right and you do not want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;discuss them.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  Look, you might try to argue that my desire to discuss them was not<br>
under my control, but the presence of two non-trivial replies to your<br>
postings should sufficiently evince that I DO want to discuss them.  I WANT<br>
to discuss them, with you and with others, somewhere else.  Is this<br>
closed-mindedness?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By saying "go to a different list", you do not, as you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;tried to convince me, just redirect traffic somewhere else. No other list</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the Extropian mailing list is read by so many Extropians -- this is</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious. On the other hand, discussion of Extropian views would be totally</i><br>
<i>&gt;inappropriate on the transhuman mailing list, as many of the people there</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not Extropians and have rejected the Extropian ideas long ago. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian mailing list is the only list where the fundamentals of Extropy</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be discussed.</i><br>
<p>
Are you trying to tell me that extropy can be discussed in one place, and<br>
one place only, and that this is it?  Please defend this assertion; it is<br>
certainly not self-evident to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;(13 deserves a bit of defense, but only a bit:  The "Extropian Principles"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;document is in version 2.6 last I checked; any part of the document can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;changed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You could add such a note to the Bible, too, without having to be afraid</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it would have any effect, because the majority would reject any</i><br>
<i>&gt;changes. And I bet that the basic Extropian Principles will remain mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt;unmodified for the next decades.</i><br>
<p>
The Extropy Institute only BEGAN in 1992, and already the "Extropian<br>
Principles" have undergone several revisions.  To my knowledge, the<br>
majority of extropians did not reject the changes in each revision.  How<br>
can you then claim to know what will happen in the next ten years, which is<br>
more than 150% of its current lifetime???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;However, we also like to have positive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;discussions about extropy, in which we aren't defending extropianism from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;criticism but rather discuss ways to bring extropy about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Understandable. That's the missionary role of your cult :-)</i><br>
<p>
As Max pointed out (in a much cruder fashion than I would have liked), you<br>
have in no way proven that extropianism is a cult.  I think we're all<br>
anxious to see this proof, ideally in a syllogism like mine.  Please<br>
provide some substantial proof that extropianism is a cult or stop making<br>
that assertion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Because my mail contained mainly opinion and little facts. It was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;criticism but critcism of not being allowed to criticize. It was written</i><br>
<i>&gt;without any source, without any document refered to. I agree that such</i><br>
<i>&gt;provocative postings should be kept to a minimum. I am opposing your</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-criticism policy, and I used harsh words to do so.</i><br>
<p>
As I noted, I'm still in favor of an ANTI: tag.  Any takers?<br>
