<i>&gt;After all the ballyhoo regarding TWA Flight 800, especially</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: Those wire problems have been found only in <br>
  737s and NOT 747s, as reports have indicated [*]:<br>
<p>
	"The FAA said on May 14 it was giving airlines<br>
	45 days to examine 737s. . . The FAA said it <br>
	took the action after analyzing the results <br>
	of 195 inspections so far which found at least <br>
	nine bare wires where the insulation had com-<br>
	pletely worn away. The 737 is the world's most <br>
	numerous airliner with more than 2,772 worldwide."<br>
<p>
  I just got word from a 747 mechanic that the pro-<br>
  blem has only been found in 737s because 747 wires <br>
  are "sheathed in teflon and they have not found the <br>
  chafed condition." TWA 800 was a 747, not a 737.<br>
<p>
  Furthermore, consider that if the wires in 737s <br>
  have been arching, causing the burning indicated,<br>
  which could cause fuel to leak and be exposed to <br>
  to the conductor, then why are not 737s exploding <br>
  left and right??! Because the Jet A-1 fuel is so <br>
  safe it does not explode, as stated previously.<br>

<p>
  Some media source, such as CNN, have failed to <br>
  mention that the problem has only been found in <br>
  737s, and careful frame the story as if it were <br>
  evidence of the cause of the TWA-800 747 crash:<br>

<i>&gt;We may dislike the system, but sometimes it works, you know.</i><br>

  IAN: It's dangerous not to second guess "the system."<br>
  Unskeptical acceptance of authorities leads to tyranny.<br>
