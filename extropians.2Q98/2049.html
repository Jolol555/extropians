If your protection doesn't go at least as far as<br>
chip-specific licensing and hardware dongle then<br>
you ain't even trying - and these have proven to<br>
be ineffective.  To date, the cost of hacking any<br>
copy protection has proven to be minuscule<br>
compared with the benefit of doing so.  Nothing in<br>
any of the schemes you have mentioned (or any I<br>
know of) fix this problem, or in fact offer any<br>
significant additional cost to the hacker."<br>
<p>
The problem is not protecting software, the<br>
problem is stopping unwanted copies. The solution<br>
is simple, don't let *anyone* copy your software.<br>
If there's only one 'copy' of the software, then<br>
you can quite easily find out who's using it (and<br>
charge without the need to identify them).<br>
<p>
I think the mistake Michael has made is that when<br>
we say, "IP law cannot be enforced." What it<br>
really means is that artists/developers/etc would<br>
not be able to control multiple copies. Does this<br>
mean a free-for-all orgy of self-indulgence? Of<br>
course not, if you can't control copies you don't<br>
make things that can be copied!<br>
