&lt;&lt; I can't reconcile god with evil because i simply can't buy the argument<br>
that<br>
 god is standing aside, neutral.  Observing.  Letting us make it or not.  For<br>
 one simple reason.  There is no such thing as being neutral in such a<br>
 situation.  It is, say, Charles Mansons, choice to commit evil. Fine.  What<br>
 about his victims?. Where did their choice go? Or the victims of horrible<br>
 diseases, accidents and the like. These may not be things you consider evil,<br>
 but I certainly consider any god that would sit by and permit such,  to be<br>
 evil, ruthless, and sadistic.  <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that it's the best reconciliation either.  But it could become<br>
more appealing if we just added more components.  Perhaps, if we came up with<br>
some identity theory to support it, any damage done by the evil choices of<br>
others is simultaneously compensated for in, say, other universes which don't<br>
interact but for the grace of God.  Or perhaps the victims are compensated<br>
later in time.  Perhaps, assuming a different view of time, the victims are<br>
simultaneously being compensated in this world.<br>
&lt;shrug&gt; But frankly the only defenses I think have a shot are the "beyond<br>
current knowledge" or "free will" defenses.<br>
