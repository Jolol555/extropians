the drive might read the boot sector of the disk, but it does not execute<br>
it.  AFAIK, you cannot get a virus simply by sticking the disk in the<br>
drive, and even if you read data from the floppy you still cannot get the<br>
boot record virii (unless, of course, you execute a program on the floppy<br>
which contains the virus).  The only way to get a boot sector virus,<br>
outside executing an executable with a virus, is to boot from a floppy, in<br>
which case the disk's boot sector gets loaded by the BIOS and executed.<br>
This is the reason why boot sector virii are almost extincts since the<br>
need to boot from floppy is extinct.  Same as above holds for CDs.  <br>
Reading data cannot heart, executing it does.<br>
