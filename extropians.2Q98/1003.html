	There is good evidence that a cetacean's sound repertoire is as<br>
complex as<br>
	our own, indicating language.  Yet we still haven't a clue what<br>
they're<br>
	'talking' about.  If we can't decode what an alien species is saying<br>
that<br>
	evolved on the same planet as us, imagine how much more difficult it<br>
will be<br>
	to communicate with species from completely alien worlds.<br>

paul, i am surprised at how often i hear this argument.   alien<br>
intelligences could<br>
send us black and white photos of themselves, newsprint style, using a long <br>
string of binary digits.  i dont think the whales have ever attemped such a<br>
thing.  <br>
i suspect that when we finally do receive signals from the cosmos, they will<br>
be <br>
easy to understand, by careful design.    gj<br>
