Very sloppy thinking...as far as I know Einstien never killed anyone...<br>
<p>
Oh...you mean mechanisms built which were derived from his theories and used<br>
by others  killed millions?<br>
<p>

<p>
and perhaps more accurately...since I don't think the combined explosions of<br>
Littleman AND Fatboy killed milllions....hundreds of thousands perhaps..<br>
