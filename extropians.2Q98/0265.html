A seriously belated set of comments about "A Sense of Life":<br>
<p>
Working with very little archive material, the filmmakers conveyed a<br>
dynamic, intense, woman whose inner drive totally overwhelmed her<br>
physical exterior and rendered her beautiful.<br>
<p>
I could have done without the stereotyped commentary about her love <br>
life.  Obviously she and her husband had quietly conducted an open <br>
relationship, in an era when one didn't speak of such things.  To <br>
characterize it as her husband 'not being enough' or Ayn 'being too <br>
much for one man' simply insults the love that they shared and shows <br>
a lack of understanding of the complexities of managing multiple <br>
relationships.  I look forward to the next movie maybe handling that <br>
part of her life in more depth.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
