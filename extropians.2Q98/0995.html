To which Paul Hughes replied:<br>

<i>&gt;The Scenario is that before we reach productive nanotech, the economy becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt;so productive and efficient through automation that people become</i><br>
superfluous.<br>
<i>&gt;So why not allow everyone who is automated out of a those jobs (i.e. layed</i><br>
off)<br>
<i>&gt;become shareholders in the company?  And since when is owning some stock in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;company equivalent to a devaluation of same?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Stock *options* are a corporate liability, and therefore devalue a company.<br>
 Issuing stock is not a liability per se, but without receiving fair value<br>
for the shares, the existing shareholders will have their value diluted<br>
significantly.  BTW, in many localities it is legally required that fair<br>
value be given for issued stock i.e. the corporation can not give it away.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;More importantly, if people are on the street with no money, they can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;contribute to the economy except through begging.  With some invested income</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can at least buy YOUR products and services and perhaps make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;contribution back to society.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A person whose only skill in this economy is labor (or begging) is<br>
worthless.  If replication is truly free (or cheap enough that everyone<br>
else doesn't mind picking up the tab) then they will likely get fed,<br>
sheltered, but largely ignored.  Fortunately, most people have value beyond<br>
their labor.  I expect an inability to adapt to an information and<br>
creativity economy to be a major "impoverishing" factor during the<br>
transition period.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or are you sugesting that as more and more of the economy becomes automated</i><br>
<i>&gt;less and less people are needed both as employees and consumers.  So at this</i><br>
<i>&gt;point one must ask why is their an economy at all if it isn't there to serve</i><br>
<i>&gt;the people?  What is the point of a business if there are no customers?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In your scenario, business as we know it is dead anyway.  All this "free"<br>
replication technology did not come out of thin air.  For there to be free<br>
replication technology and resources for all, there has to be a *serious*<br>
abdication of ownership at some point between here and there.  Such<br>
abdication might be altruistic, but I would not call it good business.<br>
