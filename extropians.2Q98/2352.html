<i>&gt;I agree that John Cramer's articles are interesting and worth reading.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm pretty skeptical about this particular antigravity model though.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anything which violates conservation of momentum is highly suspicious</i><br>
<i>&gt;in my book.  It seems that the claim is that it doesn't "really" violate</i><br>
<i>&gt;momentum conservation because (apparently) instantaneous nonlocal</i><br>
<i>&gt;(i.e. faster than light?) changes occur elsewhere to bring about balance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Handwaving about quantum nonlocality is a long way from justifying this</i><br>
<i>&gt;claim.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As for the measurements, it is notoriously difficult to get good</i><br>
<i>&gt;measurements on these kinds of devices.  The article refers to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;misleading results from the Dean drive.  There was a recent Wired article</i><br>
<i>&gt;about someone (not Podkletnov) using rotating superconducting disks, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;the reporter pointed out problems with air currents caused by bubbling</i><br>
<i>&gt;liquid nitrogen.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the experiment Cramer describes, running heavy oscillating currents</i><br>
<i>&gt;into a capacitor can cause all kinds of EM interference.  Plus, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;capacitor itself will be subject to mechanical vibrations as its internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;electrodes alternately attract and repel each other.  It all adds up to</i><br>
<i>&gt;a messy system that is going to be very hard to get clean measurements on.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
My business partner and I attempted the superconducting disk experiment in<br>
his lab. The results were negative, but there were many opportunities for<br>
experimental mistakes that could have given a false positive reading.<br>
Bubbling LN2 was the least of the problems - at one point the cryostat<br>
erupted with a geyser of LN2 and broken superconductor...<br>
<p>
Our disk was not rotating, but was inside a fairly powerful 60 Hz magnetic<br>
field at the time. I believe inrush currents caused the damage. The basis<br>
for our experiment was gleaned from an alternate energy website, and<br>
admittedly was of poor quality for a true scientific inquiry, but as the<br>
materials were dirt cheap, we could not resist trying it..<br>

PS - I have been trying to use PGP to sign these posts, but keep getting a<br>
dialog that asks for my passphrase - again and again and again - could<br>
someone give me a hint as to what I am doing wrong? I have Eudora Pro 3.0<br>
and PGP 5 that came with the package..<br>
