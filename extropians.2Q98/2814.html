 Given smart card technology, this too will become possible. I happen to know<br>
one<br>
 of the pioneers in this technology, he founded Automated Payment Systems,<br>
Inc., in<br>
 Seattle. The systems they sold were primarily for use in parking and<br>
subway/bus<br>
 system payments, but the technology is easily transferrable to everyday use<br>
for<br>
 all financial transactions, and in its present form can be used for tracking<br>
 people through public spaces. These cards have a chip in them, and a small<br>
radio<br>
 transmitter. Unlike some other systems that you need to swipe your card<br>
through,<br>
 these cards have a range of several feet, such that you could have your<br>
parking<br>
 card in your wallet, drive through the turnstile, and be charged without ever<br>
 taking out your wallet. This technology will be easily usable for tracking<br>
with<br>
 the wide installation of sensors  that can interface with this card. Not only<br>
 could such technology be used for tracking you, but if you are deemed a<br>
threat to<br>
 public safety, the powers that be could easily seize the financial assets in<br>
your<br>
 card's chip, making you helpless and easily picked up...&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Matter of fact they're using something in NY State right now called EZ Pass.<br>
You just drive right through the tolls.  But a card with a magnetic strip,<br>
which is what we're talking about, just doesn't do that.<br>
