In a message dated 98-04-17 11:10:14 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Havent there been experiments where they froze a dog for a few weeks then<br>
<i> &gt; thawed it and it came back to life?</i><br>
 <br>
 No, cryonics isn't that successful yet. But Mike Darwin et al have<br>
 held a dog at near freezing temperatures for 15 minutes with no<br>
 damage, which might be the source of the rumor.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I had heard that from my elementary teacher in the 80s, about the two week<br>
thing.<br>
<p>
We watched a film about it, they showed the dog playing, but I dont remember<br>
that much, it was 2 weeks though supposedly, maybe it wasnt.<br>
<p>
People have been dead for longer than 15 min, I think like 30 min or an hour<br>
while frozen, like from drowning in ice water, before being revived.<br>
