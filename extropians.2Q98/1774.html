<i>&gt; &gt;Still, it's possibly an Objectivist red herring to</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;*infinite* meanings, or to equate all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;post-structuralist thinking with the antics of some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;jeering court jesters.  It's just the public-goods</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;market in evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I used to think hermeneutics implied that every interpretation is a mis-</i><br>
<i>&gt; interpretation -- or, at least, that all interpretations are equal.  On this</i><br>
<i>&gt; stance, someone who believed, to use a classic example, Belgium</i><br>
<i>&gt; invaded Germany in World War One is just as right as someone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; believed the opposite as well as someone who believed there was</i><br>
<i>&gt; no war or that Belgium and Germany were both nonbelligerents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, regardless of what I think, the Objectivist movement has</i><br>
<i>&gt; penetrated and been penetrated by hermeneutics.  </i><br>

THis is rather odd. Though I imagine that you mean that as two <br>
ideological adversaries, they have engaged in internal sabotage and <br>
raconteurism of their adversaries organizations, that is to be expected. <br>
That is not hard to do, I've done the same with state Democratic Party <br>
meetings, SDS meetings, etc. It can be very informative and fun...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally, I don't believe _all_ poststructuralist, postmodernists and</i><br>
<i>&gt; hermeneutics is bunk, though like all movements, the members of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these probably do too far and lack perspective.  It's like the New</i><br>
<i>&gt; Critics who saw irony in everything or Freudians who see sex all</i><br>
<i>&gt; over the place.  I'm sure there's a good deal to be learned from all</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can learn as much from someone by studying their lies as much as </i><br>
when they tell the truth. For example, there is a whole branch of the <br>
NSA which studies nothing but disinformation. By studying what a <br>
government is saying that is truthful and what is lies, you can discern <br>
much about what they wish to hide, deny, or otherwise obfuscate<br>
