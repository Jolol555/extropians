<i>&gt; &gt;In other words, the artist should get paid a certain amount for </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;writing the book (who pays, and why?) without regard to whether many </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;people prove they like it by, for example, buying copies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An author sells the first copy to a private entity.  The market decides</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether someone wants to buy it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Meanwhile, a publisher will invest in new books, because having a new book</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the market should increase the total demand for books</i><br>
<p>
The problem is that *any* publisher can secure the rights to publish <br>
a new book, for the retail price set by the first store to have the <br>
book publically available.<br>
<p>
Since *any* publisher can do this, the *first* publisher will pay no <br>
more than his anticipated first day sales, minus the cost of setting <br>
up the production run and a reasonable profit.  Let's assume it's a <br>
massively advertised book from a major author.  An expected best <br>
seller.  Put that in real terms: an expected best-seller paperback <br>
has a first-print run of a million copies or less for the US, which <br>
print run is expected to last for three months.  So figure 100,000 <br>
copies on the first day.  (As it happens, 100,000 is also a common <br>
size print run.)  The publisher sells the books for, say, $2 each, so <br>
he gets $200,000.  He's spent $100,000 advertising it, and $75,000 on <br>
printing and distribution.  Since he gets *all* the risk, he wants <br>
most of the profit.  So the author gets $5,000.<br>
<p>
Remember, this is an expected best-seller from a major author.  And <br>
this is ALL the author will ever get for writing that book.<br>
<p>
Today, if you have never sold a novel before and a publisher offers <br>
you a $5,000 advance, you should probably keep looking for a <br>
publisher.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (from which, as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; externality, all publishers will benefit).  However, the first buyer will</i><br>
<i>&gt; gain in part from that increase in demand.  So as long as the increased</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit you get from increased demand outweighs the price the publisher must</i><br>
<i>&gt; pay the author for making the book,</i><br>
<p>
But the problem is, the publisher who pays the author for writing the <br>
book, and who pays the expenses of advertising, DOESN'T get an <br>
increased profit from the increased demand: other publishers, who pay <br>
neither of those expenses, bring the book out at a lower price.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; buying new art is still worthwhile,</i><br>
<i>&gt; though less worthwhile than it was when the government was granting</i><br>
<i>&gt; publishers monopoly status over copies of their books.</i><br>
<p>
In fact it is so much less worthwhile, that what you can afford to <br>
pay the artist is too low.  It isn't worthwhile for the artist to <br>
produce the art.<br>
<p>
If the artist doesn't produce the art, there is little for the <br>
publisher to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And in general it is never reasonable to spread the cost of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;production facilities (the author's work is an essential part of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;producing a book) over the entire production run.  The author must </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;get his entire compensation for producing the book out of the sale </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;price of the first book; the printer must get his entire </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;compensation for creating the printshop out of the first item he </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;prints.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As usual, you are confusing the production of COPIES with the creation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; NEW ART.</i><br>
<p>
As usual, you are assuming that publishers will still pay massive <br>
amounts for new art, when they cannot restrict who makes copies and <br>
therefore have no way of generating the revenue with which to pay <br>
those massive amounts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The guy who invents a printshop must get his entire compensation</i><br>
<i>&gt; from inventing the first printshop.  The printer gets her compensation from</i><br>
<i>&gt; printing books.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "Printing" books?</i><br>
<p>
I thought he would have to SELL the books.<br>
<p>
The problem is, the publisher who pays the author for writing the <br>
book in the first place -- and who pays the marketing expenses to <br>
create demand for that book -- has expenses that no other publisher <br>
must pay.  So EVERY other publisher can publish the same book, a <br>
couple days later, and sell it at a LOWER PRICE.<br>
<p>
Why do you suppose that an expected major seller comes out in <br>
hardback, and then a year later comes out in paperback?  Answer: the <br>
publisher wants to recoup as much as he can, and perhaps even make a <br>
profit, up front.  Most people who buy the book in the first week <br>
would buy the paperback if it were available, and the publisher makes <br>
less money off the paperback.<br>
<p>
You propose that SOME OTHER COMPANY can bring the paperback out THAT <br>
FIRST WEEK, and the publisher won't be harmed thereby.<br>
