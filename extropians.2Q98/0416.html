When thinking about federal (FDA/DEA) drug control, think<br>
about this. The Washington Post (04/15/98) [1] reports:<br>
<p>
<p>
      PRESCRIBED DRUGS' TOLL IS AMONG DEADLIEST<br>
<p>
	By Rick Weiss <br>
<p>
	More than 2 million Americans become <br>
	seriously ill every year because of <br>
	toxic reactions to correctly prescribed<br>
	medicines taken properly, and 106,000 <br>
	die from those reactions, a new study <br>
	concludes. That surprisingly high num-<br>
       ber makes drug side effects at least <br>
	the sixth, and perhaps even the fourth, <br>
	most common cause of death in this country.<br>
<p>
	The analysis, the largest and most <br>
	complete of its kind, suggests that <br>
	one in 15 hospital patients in the <br>
	United States can expect to suffer <br>
	from a serious reaction to prescription<br>
	or over-the-counter medicine, and about <br>
	5 percent of these will die as a result.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Study was just published today in the Journal of the <br>
American Medical Association. From the JAMA website [2]: <br>
<p>
<p>
	ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS MAY<br>
	CAUSE OVER 100,000 DEATHS AMONG<br>
	HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS EACH YEAR<br>
<p>
	Study suggests adverse drug reactions<br>
	are among the top causes of death in U.S.<br>
<p>
	CHICAGO - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) <br>
	in U.S. hospitals may be responsible <br>
	for more than 100,000 deaths nationwide <br>
	each year, making it one of the leading<br>
	causes of death, according to an article <br>
	in the April 14 issue of The Journal of <br>
	American Medical Association (JAMA). <br>
<p>
	Bruce H. Pomeranz, M.D., Ph.D., and col-<br>
	leagues from the University of Toronto, <br>
	analyzed 39 studies of ADRs in the United <br>
	States to estimate the incidence of serious <br>
	and fatal adverse drug reactions in hospital <br>
	patients. To obtain overall incidence rates <br>
	of ADRs in hospitalized patients, the re-<br>
	searchers combined the incidence of ADRs <br>
	in the hospital and the incidence of ADRs <br>
	causing admission to the hospital.<br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: Important to note: the study seems only to have <br>
included drugs prescribed to hospitalized patients,<br>
yet I would expect that most prescription drugs are<br>
prescribed to patients NOT hospitalized. If 5% of <br>
hospitalized patients prescribed a drug will die<br>
from that drug, and if hospital prescriptions <br>
account for (just a guess) 20% of all prescriptions,<br>
then there could be upwards of 500,000 people dying<br>
every year from prescription drugs (just a guestimate)!<br>
<p>
-- SOME HOLISTIC-COMPARATIVE THINKING --<br>
<p>
Now consider how a couple people died from contaminated<br>
tryptophan and the FDA bans it overnight,  paving the <br>
way for Prozac to dominate the serotonin-enhancement<br>
market without a cheap non-prescription alternative.<br>
<p>
Now consider how one person dies of a heart attack <br>
after taking an herbal supplement containing the <br>
herb ephedra and the FDA goes into hysteria that <br>
the herb must be banned, meanwhile all the FDA-<br>
APPROVED drugs have over 100,000 Americans on <br>
an assembly line to the graveyard every year!<br>
There is something seriously wrong here, and<br>
the factor that makes it all logical is power:<br>
the Govt will use any pretext to gain more power.<br>
<p>
Now think about illicit drugs. Cannabis for example<br>
kills nobody per year.  All other illicit drugs kill<br>
around 5,000 per year, and we're talking about impure<br>
drugs of strengths that vary from one "basement batch"<br>
to the next,  which is a leading reason they kill any-<br>
body.  Yet we are led to believe that they are illegal<br>
because they kill people... BULLSH*T!! They are illegal<br>
because they cause "wrong thinking" and "wrong feelings,"<br>
because they compete with alcohol, tobacco, Dupont,...<br>
<p>
We still live in medieval times, our lives controlled by<br>
barbaric and tyrannical thugs willing to resort to any <br>
level of aggression or fraud to stuff The People into<br>
a dungeon of darkness for the power-profits of a few.<br>
