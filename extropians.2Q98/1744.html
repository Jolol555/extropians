This is by no means the only method of meditation!<br>

About 3 months ago I gave people instructions on the extro list on how to do<br>
Energized Meditation (EM), which not only allows you to become very focused<br>
and aware, but intensely relaxed in deep areas of the body.  The purpose of EM<br>
is to relax areas of the body that have been locked in tension for years.<br>
Anders, did you ever try EM after I published the instructions?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wonder if we could develop a form of meditation for studying?</i><br>
<p>
Yes!  There have been several methods developed for learning meditation.  The<br>
key is RELAXATION.  Studies have show that the more relaxed you are, the more<br>
your capacity for learning (most types) is.<br>
