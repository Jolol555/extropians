  IAN: That's correct. Mid-flight accidents are very <br>
  rare. Your greatest chance of dying in-flight is by <br>
  far during take off and highest during the landing.<br>
<p>
  Mid-flight accidents are usually collisions or bombs,<br>
  in which case the fatal catastrophe is so fast one <br>
  would probably not have time to put on a parachute.<br>
  Engines can go out mid-flight, but the pilots can <br>
  still manage to land, but once again, it's the <br>
  landing that will probably kill you.<br>
<p>
  Maybe in a case like that people should have <br>
  the option of bailing out with a parachute<br>
  prior to the high-risk landing.<br>
