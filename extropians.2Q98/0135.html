Extropians,<br>
<p>
	I just had a very fascinating discussion with person I believe<br>
to be a devout humanist that revolved arround our differences (me<br>
being an extropian/transhumanist) of belief.  I noticed some very<br>
pronounced differences in our beliefs/assumptions about life.<br>
<p>
	He seemed to work off of assumption like never, will any of<br>
his children (or their children...), ever have a chance to "swim in a<br>
stream" the way he did when he was a child because of such streems now<br>
being polluted due to "overpopulation"...  For him the optimal life<br>
span was arround 100 years and he expressed that he had no desire to<br>
live any longer than that.  He was very comfortable, apperently happy<br>
with and valuing the idea of death and eventually ceasing to exist.<br>
<p>
	In contrast, as an extropian, I value having as many children<br>
as possible (while admiting that there might be cases when<br>
overpopulation is troublesem, to the extent that it might be good to<br>
make efforts to avoid for a time.) I think the more people there are<br>
the faster we can progress and the better things will become.  I<br>
"hope" that either I, or some of my children (or maybe their children<br>
and so on...) might eventually be able to live forever.<br>
<p>
	He was a slightly older person than I and I think he<br>
considered me as nothing more than a fantasizing youth.  He also<br>
indicated that he had such tendencies when he was younger.  But,<br>
anyway, I very thoroughly enjoyed our conversation and learned some of<br>
the differences between his and my beliefs/assumptions about life<br>
which I thought might be pertinent to this thread of hummanism vs.<br>
transhumanism tenants.<br>
