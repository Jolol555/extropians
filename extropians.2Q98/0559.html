Unlikely, Nature doesn't seem to have full text articles on the<br>
net. But the article I was refering to can likely be found at a<br>

   abstract = {Functional imaging studies of people who were blind<br>
from an early age have revealed that their primary visual cortex can<br>
be activated by Braille reading and other tactile discrimination<br>
tasks. Other studies have also shown that visual cortical areas can be<br>
activated by somatosensory input in blind subjects but not those with<br>
sight. The significance of this cross-modal plasticity is unclear,<br>
however, as it is not known whether the visual cortex can process<br>
somatosensory information in a functionally relevant way. To address<br>
this issue, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt the<br>
function of different cortical areas in people who were blind from an<br>
early age as they identified Braille or embossed Roman<br>
letters. Transient stimulation of the occipital (visual) cortex<br>
induced errors in both tasks and distorted the tactile perceptions of<br>
blind subjects. In contrast, occipital stimulation had no effect on<br>
tactile performance in normal-sighted subjects, whereas similar<br>
stimulation is known to disrupt their visual performance. We conclude<br>
that blindness from an early age can cause the visual cortex to be<br>
recruited to a role in somatosensory processing. We propose that this<br>
cross-modal plasticity may account in part for the superior tactile<br>
perceptual abilities of blind subjects.}  }<br>
