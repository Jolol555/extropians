&lt;&lt; While this is true, it seems to me likely that it's less to do with the<br>
 wisdom of years than with the cumulative loss of androgens.  I'd hope it<br>
 was the former, though.  It willl be interesting to see if HRT boosts crime<br>
 in the aged.<br>

I agree.  Perhaps it also has something to do with the fact that a large<br>
percentage of the  people who commit violent crimes are in prisons by the time<br>
that they're old.  Even if they are not caught the first time they commit a<br>
violent crime, they'll be caught the second or third or fourth time.  Usually<br>
and hopefully, anyway.<br>
