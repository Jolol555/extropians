First computer-assisted open-heart surgery performed in France <br>

PARIS (May 22, 1998 06:56 a.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) -- French surgeons<br>
used computers and robots to perform open heart surgery on six patients<br>
this month, a technique that doctors say could result in less trauma and<br>
pain for the patient.<br>
<p>
The first operation took place on May 7 at Paris' Broussais Hospital,<br>
followed by five other successful heart operations using the same<br>
technology, the hospital said.<br>
<p>
Developed by Intuitive Surgical, of Mountain View, Calif., the technology<br>
"lets us perform difficult, even (heretofore) impossible, gestures," Dr.<br>
Alain Carpentier, who lead the team of French doctors, said Thursday.<br>
<p>
"It's a revolution, a formidable step forward," said Carpentier, who<br>
performed the surgery with Dr. Didier Loulmet.<br>
<p>
Speaking at a news conference, Carpentier said that higher precision is<br>
among the benefits of the system officially called computer-assisted<br>
instrumentation.<br>
<p>
The system uses "mini-incisions" and is less traumatizing and less painful<br>
than traditional techniques, but also more difficult, a hospital statement<br>
said.<br>
<p>
Several of the six patients, all adults, suffered from heart valve disease.<br>
The first patient had a defect involving communication between the heart's<br>
two upper chambers, the atria.<br>
<p>
Using the system, the surgeon sits at a console several yards from the<br>
patient, peering inside the heart via a three-dimensional camera inside the<br>
patient and directing a robot that actually performs the surgery.<br>
<p>
The surgeon's gestures are transmitted by computer to the robotic tools,<br>
which "faithfully reproduce all movements of the surgeon," Carpentier said.<br>
<p>
Dr. Philip Oyer, professor of cardio-thoracic surgery at Stanford<br>
University, said the computer-assisted technique is part of a new trend of<br>
minimally invasive surgery. Much of the early promise of the techniques has<br>
not been borne out, however, he added.<br>
<p>
"But there's no doubt many people are working on it and pushing the limits<br>
and this (computer-assisted surgery) is one more step along that road,"<br>
Oyer said in a telephone interview.<br>
<p>
Carpentier said it was the U.S. military that originally conceived the<br>
notion of a robot surgeon that could work on battlefields, a dream that<br>
"sat in the drawers of the American Army for years."<br>
<p>
The physician said he was excited when operating with the new technique<br>
"because you are in a world that you have never seen before," including the<br>
insides of the heart's lower chambers.<br>
<p>
"I think it is the same emotion that the people who first walked on the<br>
moon must have felt," he said.<br>
