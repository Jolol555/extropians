<i>&gt; Astronomers discover a huge chemical "factory" in interstellar space, suggesting origin of</i><br>
<i>&gt; water in solar system</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; FOR RELEASE: APRIL 9, 1998</i><br>

<i>&gt; ITHACA, N.Y. -- A team of U.S. astronomers, led by Cornell University astrophysicist Martin Harwit, has discovered a massive</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentration of water vapor within a cloud of interstellar gas close to the Orion nebula. The amount of water measured is so high --</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough to fill the Earth's oceans 60 times a day -- that the researchers believe it provides an important clue to the origin of water in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; solar system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The amount of water vapor measured in Orion is 20 times larger than that observed in other interstellar gas clouds in our galaxy, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Milky Way. The discovery was made within the Orion molecular cloud, a giant interstellar gas cloud, a trillion miles across, composed</i><br>
<i>&gt; primarily of hydrogen molecules.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The measurements were made with the long-wavelength spectrometer aboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) launched in</i><br>
<i>&gt; November 1995 by the European Space Agency with the participation of NASA. The observations were made in October 1997 and are</i><br>
<i>&gt; reported today (April 20) in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Looking in the far-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the astronomers observed the characteristic signature of emission by</i><br>
<i>&gt; water vapor. "The interstellar gas cloud that we observed is being pummeled by shock waves that compress and heat the gas," says</i><br>
<i>&gt; Harwit, who is a Cornell professor emeritus, an ISO mission scientist and lead author on the research report. "These shock waves are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the result of the violent early stages of star birth in which a young star spews out gas that slams into its surroundings at high speed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The heated water vapor that we observed is the result of that collision," he says.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Such a high concentration of water in Orion's giant gas cloud, which swirls around millions of stars along our spiral arm of the Milky</i><br>
<i>&gt; Way, 1,500 light years from the sun, could have implications for the origin of water in the solar system, says ISO team member David</i><br>
<i>&gt; Neufeld, professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. "The interstellar gas cloud that we observed in Orion</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems to be a huge chemical factory generating enough water molecules in a single day to fill the Earth's oceans 60 times over."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eventually, he says, the water vapor will freeze, becoming small ice particles. Similar ice particles are thought to have been present</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the gas cloud from which the solar system originally formed. "It seems quite plausible that much of the water in the solar system</i><br>
<i>&gt; was originally produced in a giant water vapor factory like the one we have observed in Orion," Neufeld says.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cornell's Harwit speculates that the shock waves observed in the Orion gas cloud could be a cause as well as the result of star birth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The shock waves might also trigger the formation of additional stars and planets as they compress the gas cloud -- if the heat can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; radiated away, says Harwit. "Water vapor is a particularly efficient radiator at far-infrared wavelengths and plays a critical role in</i><br>
<i>&gt; cooling the gas and facilitating star formation," he notes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The concentration of water vapor measured by the team was about one part in 2,000 by volume. The new observations confirm</i><br>
<i>&gt; predictions by astrophysicists over the past 25 years that whenever the temperature exceeds 200 degrees Fahrenheit, chemical reactions</i><br>
<i>&gt; will convert most of the oxygen atoms in interstellar gas into water.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "An enhanced concentrator of water is precisely what we expected in this gas cloud," says team member Gary Melnick of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He adds that the strength of the water radiation detected from Orion was in perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreement with theoretical predictions published in the doctoral thesis of team member Michael Kaufman, a former Johns Hopkins</i><br>
<i>&gt; graduate student now at NASA's Ames Research Center.</i><br>

<i>&gt; the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, can be seen on the World Wide Web at</i><br>
