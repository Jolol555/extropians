Is that a new transhuman smiley?  Or is it a typo, witht the eyes and nose<br>

<p>
If art is the power (or method?) to produce certain works...  Does this imply<br>
that there is a scientific method for one thing, and an artistic method for<br>
something else?  I always felt (with no supporting documentation) that science<br>
is the technical method of creating a work, but artistic talent was the<br>
creative genius leading one to decide what to create.  An idea for something<br>
new is art, the executiion of making the idea real often is technical<br>
application of the idea.<br>
<p>
In otherwords, I have assumed that the mixing of paint was technical and<br>
scientific, but the choice of the exact shade one is trying to acheive was the<br>
art.  Photography is a scientific process of captuing and image, but finding,<br>
choosing and framing the image, and setting all the paramaters to get the right<br>
shot, that is the art.<br>
<p>
Of course this may be overly simplistic.  I often refer to Bloom's taxonomy of<br>
knowledge.  It classifies "learning" or "knowledge" into six increasing levels<br>
of difficulty, with each higher level requiring mastery of the previous<br>
levels.  Naturally, I can't recall the first two levels which have to do with<br>
memorization, so the first two may be confused in my recollection given here.<br>
<p>
	 (Lowest level of understanding.)<br>
	1  Recognition of something as being seen before.<br>
	2. Knowledge/Memorization the recall of information without a trigger<br>
stimulus.<br>
	3. Application is knowing how to use the information in a new situation. <br>
	4. Analysis is scientific study of how the information or methods work.<br>
	5. Evaluation is deciding if knowledge of methods are accurate, useful or<br>
better/worse than other knowledge or methods.<br>
	6. Synthesis is creating new information or methods.<br>
	(Highest level of understanding)<br>
