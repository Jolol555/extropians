<i>        &gt;Anthropomorphizing a bit, aren't we?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nothing wrong with that, anthropomorphizing is a useful tool, of course like  <br>
any tool it can be misused. I don't think my dog is just like me, but I don't <br>
think he's completely different either.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The behaviors animals adopt towards one another are genetically         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;based and not at all memetic, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not true, if it were animals would be in no need of a brain. Most animals <br>
that were born in captivity can never be released into the wild because they <br>
don't have the education to survive. A songbird that has never heard another <br>
bird only develops a stilted much simplified version of the song <br>
characteristic of its species. The song of the Humpback Whale consists of<br>
extremely elaborate variations on a simple theme, a Bach Fugue does the same <br>
thing and is no more complicated. The song changes from year to year,  <br>
different tunes top the pop charts, and the difference is even greater from  <br>
decade to decade, as great as the change in musical styles from Classical to <br>
Swing to Jazz to Rock.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why not try Dawkins's _Selfish Gene_?</i><br>
<p>
A terrific book, one of the very best.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;My whole point is that animals have no qualms over killing one         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;another if it is in their own self interest</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Not so. It would be in the self interest of a bitch to kill her puppies, yet <br>
she does not do so.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;animals are MORE ruthless than humans: at least some of the humans         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;think they're killing for a noble cause. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
They're the most dangerous sort, but regardless, do you have any evidence <br>
that animals think  differently in that regard?<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I will stand by this point until you can find me an animal which         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;understands and respects property rights. (Not urinating indoors         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;does not count.)  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why not, seems an important point to me.<br>
<p>
I've also noticed that when I walk my dogs on my (our) property and they meet <br>
a strange dog they're usually aggressive and the other dog submissive, but <br>
when we're far from my home the situation is reversed.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I would not find it at all acceptable if you killed another human,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;even if you ate them afterwards. (In  fact, especially not in that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;case.)  So why exactly should we grant animals the same license?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We don't. Sometimes humans engage in cannibalism but it's rare, the same is <br>
true of all mammals.                               <br>
