In the same vein, I would say that all major scientific advances of the<br>
past have come from highly creative thinkers. You cannot get these<br>
things through "rationalism" alone. I think the place where logic and<br>
rational thought fits in is testing the hypotheses that are made by the<br>
creative mind. For example Einstein's creation of the theory of General<br>
Relativity was probably the greatest example of creative/lateral<br>
thinking of the human mind. He then used logic and Riemann mathematics<br>
to prove that his " creation" was valid. i.e. working back to his<br>
starting point - finding his way home, if you will<br>
