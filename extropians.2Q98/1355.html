I think you're missing something, though.  The human race has a whole history<br>
stretching back thousands of years: language, traditions, symbolism,<br>
technology, art and literature, philosophy, myths and legends, great<br>
achievements and adventures, etc.  This whole tremendous, interwoven body of<br>
knowledge defines our cultural identity.  A "small change in basic<br>
motivations" can't provide an alternative to all that.<br>

<p>

Not easily.  See above.<br>

<p>
Gee, I guess now I'll have to read the book!  I've had it sitting on my<br>
bookshelf for ages.<br>
<p>
Let's frame the question differently...  Imagine you've *discovered* a<br>
sentient race living in primitive conditions.  Are you morally obligated to<br>
give them advanced technology?  Or should you be required to leave them alone<br>
so they can develop their own identity?  (RE: Prime Directive)<br>
<p>
It's not an easy question.  I've long felt the Prime Directive, as presented<br>
in Star Trek, is a bunch of hogwash.  On the other hand, it's easy to imagine<br>
how a less advanced culture could be *obliterated* by wide open contact with a<br>
highly advanced one.  All the achievements and richness that they could have<br>
achieved on their own is forfeit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; What happens when a highly sophisticated, non-sentient AI can pass</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the Turing Test?  How do you convince most people that a machine is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; non-sentient when it can so convincingly /pretend/ to be?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;IMHO, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck or</i><br>
<i>&gt;at least a good approximation. :-)</i><br>
<p>
As I told someone else, the most obvious difference is that you can tell your<br>
non-sentient AI to *stop* pretending to have human-like feelings, and it will<br>
do so.<br>
