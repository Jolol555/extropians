<p>
I find most of Afghan justice rather repulsive, actually...I certainly <br>
don't endorse things like the stoning of adulterers or the mutilation of <br>
thieves.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and see yourself as a transhumanist, this is certainly your right too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As Nick said in his principles/declaration/manifesto, "transhumanism is</i><br>
<i>&gt; politically neutral" (and yes, I find this sentence useful).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But, because the posts of this list are archived and I worry, as Arjen</i><br>
<i>&gt; does, about PR of transhumanism, I cannot let strangers or newbies</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that these extremist positions are in some way representative of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanist thought.(even if I aknowledge the fact that the posters</i><br>
<i>&gt; used wisely the "I find", "I think" words).</i><br>
                                         <br>
For the record, here's a disclaimer: the views expressed by me in the<br>
postings sent to the extropian list are not necessarily the views of<br>
any transhumanistic/extropian institution, individual or group of individuals. <br>
They solely represent a (rather poor) reflection of my thoughts at the <br>
moment of writing, and should be no means be considered definitive.<br>
                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm a transhumanist: this means I want to abolish death and suffering.</i><br>
<p>
Is the desire to elliminate death and suffering *in general* an official tenet<br>
of transhumanism then? That would be rather, eh, missionary-like (and<br>
certainly not what I consider "neutral", although it's a great _personal_<br>
goal).<br>
<p>
Also: I'm a transhumanist: this means (among other things) that I hold <br>
no view or custom sacred, but openly question everything. This includes <br>
the widespread idea that capital punishment and torture are inherently <br>
bad, and can't by definition be incorporated into a modern, fair justice <br>
system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As such, I think my job is to accelerate my own evolution and help</i><br>
<i>&gt; people to do the same thing, not to punish them with tortures or</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentence them to death.</i><br>
<p>
Most people (me included) don't *want* to punish or torture people<br>
(certainly not for its own sake), but I do belief that when prevention<br>
has failed and the damage has been done, some sort of action has<br>
to be taken. Letting criminals walk is neither fair nor practical -- you<br>
are sending a very wrong message. So, some kind of punishment<br>
is required, and of all those available I prefer the consequent principle<br>
of returning the damage to the source, "to make one reap what he sows".<br>
The punishment is customized to the crime. Also, one shouldn't <br>
forget that most criminals aren't poor victims that had to steal to<br>
survive or something like that, but ruthless individuals who don't respect<br>
other people's life, freedom and/or property. Why should we be mild<br>
to them?<br>
<p>
What would _you_ (if you were the state) with criminals (thieves, rapists,<br>
murderers and the like)? After all, no matter how good the prevention<br>
there will always be people who'll manage to do something really bad.<br>
