<p>
Tomography! However, to get atomic level resolution, as I imagine you would<br>
need to get the physical memory structures of the brain recorded, you would<br>
need some pretty short wavelengths. These might end up being anything but<br>
non-destructive..<br>
<p>
MRI has always intrigued me, but I believe it cannot achieve the required<br>
resolution due to the same wavelength limitations. What is fine for imaging<br>
is terrible for replication..<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;Since I've gone from being conservative on my first point to being</i><br>

<i>&gt;There has been some recent discussion about traveling into the past on</i><br>
<i>&gt;this list.  I've always been more interested in the possibility of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;"peering into the past technology" (PIP Tech) rather than actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;traveling into the past.  I define  PIP Tech as the ability to peer</i><br>
<i>&gt;into the past focusing on known coordinates at a specified past time</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the ability to scan a biological brain with near molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt;resolution.  I do not see PIP Tech as having some of the paradox and</i><br>
<i>&gt;contradiction problems associated with time travel.  Although the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle causes some concern.   I just want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;throw this long shot idea out for the space time engineering types to</i><br>
<i>&gt;consider because it is obviously outside of my area of expertise. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;idea of using a black hole as a lens into the past by re-mapping the</i><br>
<i>&gt;distorted star field would not work here because I don't think you</i><br>
<i>&gt;could use the nearest existing black hole to peer through our</i><br>
<i>&gt;atmosphere at that resolution.  But what if we had a similar machine</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the light pulsing and rotating one described above pointed to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;nearest black hole.  Such a machine could be built cheap with todays</i><br>
<i>&gt;tech because the difficult part is receiving only the photons in that</i><br>
<i>&gt;very short window that underwent no collisions.  And that part would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be accomplished by the future machine.  This is just one possible path</i><br>
<i>&gt;to (machine in the present) assisted PIP Tech.  That is, we build a</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine now in anticipation of assisting a future machine to peer into</i><br>
<i>&gt;the past.  I really have no sound working theory for PIP Tech.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;above example was just to get the idea across so the space time</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering types could ponder the idea.  But I cannot dismiss it</i><br>
<i>&gt;because of the immediate grand impact it would have.  The present</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine along with a sound theory for the future machine(as opposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;a working model)would have an immediate impact.  Thats a first.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt;use a sound theory for a future machine to get immediate results</i><br>
<i>&gt;before building that machine.  If nothing else, I guess this could</i><br>
<i>&gt;make for some interesting sci-fi.</i><br>

That reminds me of an ad in the back of Fantasy and Science Fiction back in<br>
the '70's. The premise was 'Be part of our quest to achieve time trasvel!'<br>
The method (I bit and sent in my $5) was that the organization would bury a<br>
'time capsule' somewhere with the names of all the people who donated<br>
money. At some time and place to be named on the plaque, a future time<br>
traveller would appear with his machine, which would then be donated to the<br>
organization to achieve their goal.<br>
<p>
Never did hear what happened to them, I consider the $5 to be an investment<br>
in a rather bad sci-fi plot..<br>
