In a message dated 98-05-30 13:35:45 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Could it really be that, of the <br>
 aprrox. 6 billion people on earth, only a couple of hundred or so really<br>
think <br>
 rationally ? &gt;&gt;<br>
frightening...but all too possible...ok, ok...so maybe it's in the<br>
thousands...:-)<br>
<p>
seems to me that the problem is that thinking takes too much effort for most<br>
people. far easier to let someone else think for them, f'r instance, their<br>
"Psychic Hotline"... <br>
<p>
i realise that my posts tend to sound a little disparaging of the mental<br>
abilities of most people, but the evidence is all 'round me, in the papers, on<br>
tv, even just walking down the block.  i am often astounded at the sheer<br>
ignorance, stupidity, and obliviousness i witness. <br>
i'd be interested to know how the list feels about this. do you feel that<br>
people in general are smarter than they are given credit for?..does it only<br>
seem as if the general level of knowledge, understanding, and intelligence is<br>
slipping?..or is this a legitimate concern?<br>
i dislike to be so negative, but at least once a day i find myself frustrated<br>
or inconvenienced by someone's boneheadedness<br>
i'd appreciate some feedback from the list.. thanks.Cori<br>
