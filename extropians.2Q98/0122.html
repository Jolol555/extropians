You think they're not easy pickings now?  (Of course they're easy pickings<br>
now, Dan, but right at least for now they generally have the support of the<br>
government.)  Oh, so you're trusting the powerful to be benevolent to the<br>
poor?  <br>
<p>
Alternately, you think they wouldn't be easy pickings under anarcho-socialism?<br>

No, the other relation that counts is with another alternative PPA.  See<br>
below.<br>

Whenever someone, anyone, has a gun, there's no way to PREVENT them from<br>
using it.  The only thing you can do is assure them that if it is used,<br>
retribution will be swift and deadly.  This is all we can EVER do to<br>
prevent the misuse of guns.  Getting them out of the hands of the people<br>
and putting them in the hands of the government only makes this worse, for<br>
reasons of which you're already aware.<br>
<p>
Bill Gates has a big gun.  We can't stop him from using his big gun; we can<br>
only point a big gun back at him and say "OK.  You COULD fire your big gun<br>
at us; but if you do, we'll fire our big gun back."  Would you call this<br>
"trusting the powerful to be wise?"  I wouldn't.  But if you would, then I<br>
cede this point to you, and argue that in some cases, there's nothing else<br>
you ever CAN do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;i am not saying that he could not do it now, although i think he would</i><br>

<p>
More expensive than taking the Indian government head-on?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;i would say the anarcho-capitalist system is the only one where they don't</i><br>

<i>&gt;greater leverage on india's army than in the PPA based one.</i><br>
<p>
If the Indian government is bribed, they would have exactly no leverage,<br>
and no where to turn.  If one PPA is bribed, people could go get leverage<br>
from other PPAs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;you didn't disprove anything, you just seem to assume a huge package is</i><br>
<i>&gt;attached to the words "freedom" and "tyrannical" (which i never used in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;description of the PPA's action, BTW).  In this context, tyrannical just</i><br>

<i>&gt;this definition of "tyranical".  so please, don't use words that have</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyday meanings attached to them which do not fit in this scenario.</i><br>
<p>
You're right, I misunderstood what you meant by tyrannical.  I had presumed<br>
that you had just meant that the tyrannized subjects couldn't leave;<br>
clearly, you mean that the tyrannized subjects couldn't leave AND they were<br>
being overtaxed.  So allow me to adjust my argument.<br>
<p>
My taxes to the state are greater than my payment to the PPA; if their<br>
costs were equal, then the state would indeed be at an advantage.  However,<br>
you have to force me to pay my taxes, and I volunteer to give money to the<br>
PPA.  Forcing me to pay costs a certain amount of money.  (I'll define this<br>
cost, for the time being, as "the window of freedom."  :) )  If the window<br>
of freedom is greater than the difference between the state's taxes and the<br>
price of the PPA, then I am worth more to the PPA than I am to the state.<br>
<p>
Clearly, the PPA benefits by increasing the window of freedom, because it<br>
allows the PPA to charge less and still remain competitive with the state.<br>
How can the window of freedom be increased?  Threatening war with the<br>
state.  War, too, has a cost to both the state and PPAs; by avoiding war,<br>
they save its cost.<br>
<p>
A powerful PPA could potentially cost the government a lot of money in war;<br>
 this creates a large window of freedom.  However, if alternative PPAs are<br>
weak relative to the state, the window of freedom will be smaller.<br>
Nonetheless, the existence of a window of freedom provides PPAs with a<br>
competitive advantage over the state, ceteris paribus.<br>
<p>
To be fair, war is not free for a PPA either.  How much war could we<br>
reasonably expect a PPA to be willing to wage?  The profit maximization<br>
rule states that a PPA should be prepared to wage war up until the point<br>
where spending more money on war would outweigh the revenue they would gain<br>
by doing so.  (ie that war's marginal revenue should equal its marginal cost.)<br>
<p>
Let's bring this back to your original point.  The state, we note, will be<br>
charging the full price of its taxes while the PPA will only be earning<br>
that amount minus some fraction of the window of freedom.  Therefore, the<br>
state's marginal revenue will be higher than the PPA's.  However, the<br>
difference between the state's marginal revenue and the PPA's marginal<br>
revenue is only a fraction of the window of freedom, while the difference<br>
in cost is the entire window.  Thus, by setting their prices equal to the<br>
amount currently charged in taxes minus (for example) half the window of<br>
freedom, PPAs create an environment under which it is more profitable for<br>
the state to relinquish its citizens than it would be for it to wage war<br>
with the PPA.<br>
<p>
And that is why it is profitable for a PPA to compete with a state.<br>
<p>
(As a side note, anonymous digital cash and other forms of exchange over<br>
the Internet make it expensive to force people to pay taxes for goods and<br>
services, thus increasing the window of freedom.  So does having a lot of<br>
guns in decentralized places.  So does anarchist propaganda.  Keep up the<br>
good work!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"There's no question" and "DEFINITELY".  brilliantly supported argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt;the first one is simply false, since i questioned it in the paragraph you</i><br>
<i>&gt;were answering to, and "definitely" doesn't do much better.  so, i have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ask, how do you know? and how are you so sure?</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  The DEFINITELY and "no question" were emphasis.  I'll back it up<br>
with numbers.<br>
<p>
How do I know that the military could be paid more than it is right now?<br>
Well, let's see.  Bill Gates makes more than $500K every month.  No<br>
military general does.  (At least, not over the table.)  I reason that they<br>
could acquire this much, and more, using their weapons.  Do you mean to<br>
tell me that this increase in income would not be worth the effort of<br>
taking over the country?  Or is it simply that they refuse to do so because<br>
they think it's immoral to do that sort of thing?  And if the latter,<br>
wouldn't you feel a little more comfortable if you had at least SOME kind<br>
of backup system in case the current one decided to take what it could get<br>
from the rest of the nation?<br>
