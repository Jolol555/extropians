<i>&gt; What? You think Religions are seeking</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth?</i><br>
<p>
I think "religion" is seeking truth.  Religions have generally found<br>
it.  Just like "science" seeks knowledge (or the creation of theory)<br>
and General Relativity has found it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd say that that pretty much defines</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they are NOT doing and what</i><br>
<i>&gt; science IS doing. Almost without</i><br>
<i>&gt; except, religions consider their</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of truth to be defined,</i><br>
<i>&gt; like, case closed. On the other hand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in science the supreme truth, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be the "Unified Field Theory,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; is yet to be found, and admittedly so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; So what is actively being sought in</i><br>
<i>&gt; science is absolute knowledge of truth</i><br>
<i>&gt; (that's why people are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; researching).  The "religious seeker"</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be looking for truth, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtually any given religion has</i><br>
<i>&gt; "found it."</i><br>
<p>
Even if science were seeking "the supreme truth" what scientists would<br>
claim to have found it?  As it happens quite a few, and they were all<br>
wrong.  And when we find the Theory of Everything that defines<br>
everything from Quantum Gravity to why I'm on this list, it'll still<br>
be false.  I honestly have no use for the truth.  The truth bores me. <br>
If you're looking for truth in science then it's going to be a long<br>
day.  Religion offers instant satisfaction (a great thing in this<br>
consumer society).  So which of the two is better?  Fortunately<br>
neither science nor extropianism claims to offer the truth, so we're<br>
safe.<br>
<p>
[BTW, I'm fully aware that I'm contradicting some previous posts,<br>
"Open Truth Networks" for instance.  However, I still think it's<br>
possible for an open society to exist under the illusion of truth (as<br>
John K. Clark said at the time, in reality the truth could be any<br>
number of things, we can never be entirely sure).  Perhaps a closed<br>
society (via increased personal privacy, cryptography, anonymity,<br>
etc.) would lead to the disillusion of "truth" and "reality" and the<br>
advancement of society.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Religions have truths generally in</i><br>
<i>&gt; spite of themselves. Because they had</i><br>
<i>&gt; some wise observers at their roots, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; along the way. Yet in the broad</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition that Erik applies to ExI,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could even define science as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; religion, since it has principles and</i><br>
<i>&gt; de facto rituals. But a scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; ritual of investigation seeks to gain</i><br>
<i>&gt; new information, whereas most</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious rituals seek to simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; repeat old information.</i><br>
<p>
Science seeks to gain knowledge, not information.  Knowledge advances<br>
us by creating more knowledge; information doesn't have this property.<br>
 Perhaps we could say science is a religion by Erik's definition, but<br>
that would contradict my definition so I'd rather not.<br>
<p>
[Theories should be judge through benefit...]<br>
<i>&gt; That's the principle I see people here</i><br>
<i>&gt; applying to my holistic theory: "Ya,</i><br>
<i>&gt; OK, so it's true, but so what? Does it</i><br>
<i>&gt; get a better mouse trap, a faster</i><br>
<i>&gt; car?" Utility over truth.</i><br>
<p>
So your theory yields absolutely no benefit, creates no knowledge, and<br>
has no application?  In that case I would question whether it is<br>
theory or just noise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think that principle, "utility over</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth," is actually pretty religious.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Religions serve a utilitarian purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt; to those therein. It gets them feeling</i><br>
<i>&gt; better, it gives them stability, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; gives them fraternity, hope, and so</i><br>
<i>&gt; forth.</i><br>
<p>
If your seeking truth then religion is the perfect answer, so it does<br>
have utility.  Knowledge simply leads to more knowledge or<br>
information, which is (from my point of view) beneficial.  However, in<br>
a utilitarian sense knowledge is not always beneficial, in fact<br>
religion is probably the best answer to any utilitarian philosophy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Show them that the underlying claims</i><br>
<i>&gt; of truth their religion stands on are</i><br>
<i>&gt; false and that doesn't really matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; to them, since truth is NOT the real</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal they are after. So I see your</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of the goal of science as</i><br>
<i>&gt; more fitting to the goal of religion.</i><br>
<p>
Truth is what they seek, which truth doesn't matter since all truths<br>
were created equal.  Tell them their ideas are false and of course<br>
they won't listen.  Prove to them that their ideas are false and<br>
you've done the impossible.  Science and truth do not mix, science can<br>
never discover a truth because *everything* is open to question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think it falls apart totally in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe that the degree to which</i><br>
<i>&gt; science yields material outcomes is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the degree to which science has</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovered truths.  And future</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefits from science will come from</i><br>
<i>&gt; future discoveries of truth.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From my perspective (I expect we agree in more ways than our semantics</i><br>
allow) what is true and what is false are one and the same.  Anything<br>
that you consider to be true I can offer a counter truth, neither and<br>
both of these are true.  The truth is unknowable.<br>
