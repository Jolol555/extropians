<i>&gt; From:          "Derek Strong" &lt;derek@zhmort.com&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Hal:  I'd love it if you (or anyone else) could provide some good links for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Y2K  skepticism (if I can call it that).</i><br>
<p>
I don't know that there'll be many of those.<br>
<p>
First, the people who think that Y2K will be no big deal, think that <br>
it's no big deal.  People tend not to write substantial <br>
well-researched essays on things that are no big deal.<br>
<p>
Second, even the people who think that it'll be no big deal, are NOT <br>
forecasting a problem-free transition.  Me, I'm a computer <br>
programmer, I'm trying to arrange to get at least a month off wrapped <br>
around Jan 1 2000.  If I can manage to take off the entire months of <br>
December and January, I expect the problems will be fixed (or <br>
otherwise dealt with) at my place of employment; if I can't get any <br>
time off, I expect I'll work two or three 60-hour weeks on the <br>
recovery effort -- putting my *current* work behind schedule.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's really easy to find stuff by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fear-mongerers, and it is useful to look over what they have to say. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've had more difficulty tracking down contrary reasoning (saying why we</i><br>
<i>&gt; shouldn't be too fearful) with anything like the detail found on North's or</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yourdon's sites.</i><br>
<p>
That's because it's a lot easier to provide great detail, when you <br>
are free to make it up and to ignore anything that doesn't agree with <br>
you.<br>
