In the Extropian society, is the core principle:<br>
<p>
"We acknowledge only those truths that are useful."<br>
<p>
Such seems to be the consensus, stated in so many <br>
words, of some of the members of this list. If so,<br>
then truth is a subset of the set of "utility" (U),<br>
and as such, x is a member of U if and only if x <br>
is useful. So the Extropian principle would be:<br>
<p>
"We acknowledge only those things that are useful."<br>
<p>
The Nazi Party found the extermination of all who <br>
disagreed with their agenda very useful and adhered<br>
faithfully to the utility-first principle that many <br>
on the ExI list adhere to. Does ExI = Nazism? I say <br>
no! I believe it is not the right ExI principle. I <br>
believe that to the extent we are directed to that <br>
principle we are infected with totalitarian memes.<br>
<p>
I have advocated utilitarianism, but <br>
I think there may be a higher principle.<br>
<p>
With a scientific definition of truth (like perhaps,<br>
X = truth if f:X-&gt;Y = f(a)=f(a'), which is to say, X <br>
is the truth if the mapping of X on to the physical <br>
world Y is a one-one function, i.e., that X is the <br>
truth if X accurately models the physical reality <br>
without contradiction) then what's wrong with an <br>
Extropian "truth first" principle? Maybe some-<br>
thing is wrong with it, I'm not God, but <br>
should this not be defined logically? <br>
But then that would be truthful... no?<br>
What is the logical case against truth?<br>
<p>
In the case of countering national socialism, the <br>
utility (appealing to the utilitarian) of truth-<br>
first is that it is not true that your agenda, or <br>
your well-being, is maximized by the initiation of <br>
aggression upon other humans. Einstein escaped the <br>
Nazis, how many Einstein's did not? Even more, not <br>
killing people but using them as slaves also does <br>
not maximize the well-being of slaveholders versus<br>
a society in which all are free to come and go. <br>
The descendants of slave holders are better off <br>
because of free markets, not antebellum slavery.<br>
<p>
In sum, I believe truth can lead to Extropia!<br>
<p>
What's wrong with a truth-first principle?<br>
