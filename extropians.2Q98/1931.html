Yes.  Elephants push the limit of elephant construction, just as any animal<br>
gently pushes the limit of it's construction.  Waste does poorly in natural<br>
selection.  If elephants had a larger portion of their mass in bone, they<br>
could be much larger - but at their present size that would be a waste, so<br>
they don't have it.<br>

Well, there are some - in the sea.  Whales are by far the largest creatures<br>
every to have lived.<br>
<p>
At present we really don't know much about the advantages and disadvantages of<br>
size.  Some of the Eocene mammals were far larger than an elephant.  Since<br>
the Eocene, I think mammoths have been as big as they get.  This is just one<br>
of those situations where we know a fact but cannot explain it.  It happens.<br>
