Excellent Point!  It is absolutely not necessary to create a new and <br>
independent country in order to purse goals of transhumanism<br>
or any other ideological, political, or religious movement.  The idea<br>
is just a nostalgic appeal to the disappearing age of state dominated<br>
social and political world order.  A more contemporary organization <br>
which can easily transcend state lines and provide environment and <br>
infrastructure will serve muchmore effectively to further the cause without<br>
unnecessary overhead usually associated with a creation of a new <br>
Utopian state (We still have to see one).  A corporation is one of the<br>
many options.  What is nexi?  Sorry, I am a newbie...<br>

<i>&gt;This is another of those threads that seem to reincarnate from time to</i><br>
<i>&gt;time. The appeal is obvious: a place where we can be free and do what</i><br>
<i>&gt;we want to do. Great! But then reality intrudes, and we get all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems of practicalities of sea engineering, silly laws about</i><br>
<i>&gt;territories, the worry about defenses, and eventually it tend to run</i><br>
<i>&gt;into the perennial libertarian discussion. There have been several</i><br>
<i>&gt;similar projects beside Oceania, and none have succeeded (most never</i><br>
<i>&gt;left the paper). The reason seems to be that while a lot of people</i><br>
<i>&gt;like the idea, few are really wanting to pay a lot to participate, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;you need serious funding and planning for a project like this. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually a worry I have about the Millennial Project, which at least</i><br>
<i>&gt;has thought about making the islands profitable from the start.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe we should rethink the question. Last time this thread of</i><br>
<i>&gt;building an extropia came up people began to discuss various islands</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead. After all, a completely independent new nation might be</i><br>
<i>&gt;overdoing it, it might be enough to have breathing room. Maybe one</i><br>
<i>&gt;could back down even further: the most important thing in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt;really create a working community for this kind of project is of</i><br>
<i>&gt;course the community itself. Where it is and what jurisdiction is</i><br>
<i>&gt;involved is really secondary, since if you don't have the community in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the first place there is no way you could make the floating island</i><br>
<i>&gt;work. It is a good idea to figure out how to build the core community</i><br>
<i>&gt;and test it out first before trying to achieve soverignity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What form the community might have is interesting. Right now we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the extropian nexi, and one could imagine something like an</i><br>
<i>&gt;employee-owned transhumanist corporation that grows out from it. If we</i><br>
<i>&gt;can create transhuman communities that have not just social but also</i><br>
<i>&gt;economical potential I think we will be on to something.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To sum up: I want to live in Oceania/New Utopia/Stateless too, but we</i><br>
<i>&gt;need more than a loophole in UN regulations to do it. It might be</i><br>
<i>&gt;better to start with thinking of how to create transhumanist</i><br>
<i>&gt;companies.</i><br>
