Here are the current ExI membership detials. If you just want to know current<br>
subscription rates, you can go to the end.<br>
<p>
The next Exponent newsletter will go into production soon. It's easier to send<br>
it out all at once than individually to new members, so if we receive your<br>
renewal by June 10, USA members can subtract $10. (Overseas folks already have<br>
a lower rate...)<br>

Greetings!  We’re sending you this information message either because you<br>
requested it, or because someone suggested you would be interested. This<br>
message tells you what Extropy Institute does and how to become involved. For<br>
further information (and an online membership form), we encourage you to visit<br>

President          Extropy Institute (ExI)<br>
<p>
     Extropy = the extent of a system’s intelligence, information, vitality,<br>
diversity,<br>
     opportunity, and capacity for growth.<br>
<p>
<p>
E X T R O P Y  I N S T I T U T E<br>
<p>
Extropy Institute (ExI) is a 501[c][3] tax-exempt educational corporation,<br>
founded in 1992 as an outgrowth of the Extropy journal. ExI acts a catalyst<br>
for<br>
a better future by helping individuals extend their lives, augment their<br>
intelligence, optimize their psychology, and improve their communities. The<br>
Institute pursues this catalytic role in two ways: through a creative process<br>
of networking and an educational process of disseminating ideas.<br>
<p>
In its creative role, the Institute brings together the finest critical and<br>
innovative minds in an intellectual and social network. This network of<br>
thinkers challenges conventional ideas about human limits and develops new<br>
ideas about the use of technologies of all kinds to improve the future.<br>
Seeking<br>
to develop careful thinking about extending the human life span, augmenting<br>
human intelligence, improving human psychology, and refining economic and<br>
political organization, Extropy Institute provides several forums for<br>
networking and creative thinking. The Exponent newsletter gathers news of<br>
developments, members’ projects, and Institute activities. The EXTRO<br>
conferences bring together thinkers from numerous fields of study. Other<br>
seminars and local meetings, the Extropians email list, and the web site<br>
provide additional forums for developing and refining ideas.<br>
<p>
In its educational role, the Institute brings these (always open and evolving)<br>
extropian ideas to the public in order to encourage more rational practices<br>
and<br>
beliefs. The Institute’s web site provides information on extropian thinking<br>
and links to further resources. Extropy Online presents extropian thinking<br>
gathered from the best minds in a manner accessible to intelligent<br>
non-specialists. The EXTRO conferences, in addition to their networking role,<br>
also act as a means of communicating current extropian thinking to the public.<br>
The Institute disseminates ideas and educates the public through<br>
appearances of<br>
its members on television and in newspapers, magazines, and books, and by<br>
representing extropian perspectives at conferences and in debates.<br>
<p>
In essence, the Institute seeks to catalyze continual discoveries that extend<br>
our lives and increase the power and depth of our minds. While Institute<br>
members may hold diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas about how to pursue<br>
these ends, we agree in affirming the values expressed in the Extropian<br>
Principles: Boundless Improvement, Self-Transformation, Self-Ownership,<br>
Dynamic<br>
Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous Order. [see<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm%5D">http://www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm%5D</a>&gt;www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm]<br>
<p>
<p>
E X T R O P I A N S  O N  T H E  N E T<br>
<p>
Extropy Institute sponsors a number of forums for sharing limit-busting,<br>
life-extensionist, pro-technology, and other extropian ideas with bright,<br>
like-minded individuals around the globe.<br>
<p>
You can also access the Frequently Asked Questions file, and other Extropian<br>
writings, on the World Wide Web. The official ExI Web page:<br>

which<br>
boils over with lively discussion and debate on numerous topics. You can join<br>

Moving to the web in its tenth year, Extropy is a magazine covering the full<br>
range of advanced, emerging, and future technologies with an emphasis on<br>

cognitive techniques.<br>
*    How to modify your mood and motivation with new drugs, and cognitive<br>
management.<br>
*    Where does traditional thinking about radical technologies go wrong?<br>
*    How can we refine our political and social organization? How can<br>
spontaneous order enable us to handle accelerating change?<br>
*    Rethinking traditional moralities in the face of scientific and<br>
technological breakthroughs.<br>
*    Plus: Nanotechnology and molecular computers; artificial wombs and new<br>
methods of parenting; transhumanist philosophy to make sense of rapid change;<br>
prosexual drugs and nutrients; critical thinking about environmental and<br>

If you're tired of shallow, trendy, or uncritical thinking on the<br>
technological<br>
frontier, Extropy will satisfy, startle, and stimulate you. <br>

    "I love it. Extropy excites the hell out of my mind." ZL, 1/93<br>
 <br>
    "In general I would call it the best periodical I have ever seen in my<br>
life..." AC, 8/92<br>
 <br>
    "I just wanted to let you know that Extropy keeps getting better &amp; better!<br>
(as, of course, it must in order to be so named). What a uniformly excellent,<br>
eclectic, thoughtful, well-written selection of articles. By far the most<br>
thought-provoking, ground-breaking stuff in any magazine I read."  [PG, 7/94]<br>
