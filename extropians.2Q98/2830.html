[Warning: wild handwaving and very theoretical physics follows!]<br>
<p>
Even more in the realm of blue sky speculations (ultraviolet sky?) is<br>
sub-Planck computing. It makes femtotech look safe and<br>
well-understood. <br>
<p>
The idea I have is based on reading "Cellular Networks as Models for<br>
Planck-Scale Physics" by Manfred Requardt (hep-th/9806135), where he<br>
plays around a bit with cellular networks of nodes connected by bonds<br>
according to local laws. The hope here is that somehow the local<br>
combinatorial dynamics will in the large scale low energy limit<br>
simplify itself into some reasonable spacetime physics. In the<br>
meantime he derives a kind of discrete functional analysis and<br>
geometry on this kind of stochastic web. Amazing stuff that manages to<br>
become suspiciously like differential geometry.<br>
<p>
Anyway, if Requardt (and Penrose before him) is right, then physics is<br>
really sub-Planck CA dynamics in this stochastic network, with our<br>
physics as an emergent phenomenon on top of it. This network dynamics<br>
looks like a great medium for doing computation since it is truly<br>
discrete, and on this level there is no noise. Of course, manipulating<br>
it to set up a computation might turn out to be inefeasible (not just<br>
because our tools may be *way* too large even with femtotech, but also<br>
because the present patterns might erode the computational structure;<br>
we might need to isolate it from the ordinary activity with some kind<br>
of Planck-scale barrier). <br>
<p>
[End of wild speculation and a mild suggestion to concentrate on what<br>
to do in 2020 instead :-)]<br>
