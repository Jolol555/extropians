<p>
Surely the income is conceived primarily as a dividend from the<br>
increasingly cybernated components of the economy.  How this is realised is<br>
up for grabs.  In Australia recently, a large chunk of the publicly owned<br>
telcom was put on the market, and about a third of the nation's families<br>
bought shares that instantly appreciated, netting them a windfall.  This<br>
looks like theft, to me - a public asset notionally owned by everyone was<br>
reallocated to a subset of the community with the spare money to buy it.<br>
But maybe such allocations of shares could be managed in such a way that<br>
the people being displaced from work get a continuing share in the extra<br>
productivity their absence made possible.  (And yes, the desperates among<br>
them will find ways to sell these off for drugs etc and be back with their<br>
hands out the next week.  Opinions clearly differ over ways to circumvent<br>
this or simply accept it as `evolution in action' - a heartless and<br>
nauseating phrase when applied to human suffering, in my sanctimonious view.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Economist have a lot to say about variations on minimum income schemes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and I really think you'd benefit from reading more of that literature.</i><br>
<p>
I know, I'm shockingly ignorant.  All I was trying to do was point in the<br>
direction of a class of possible solution that economists had proposed to<br>
ease the social horrors of the transition to a largely jobless society.<br>
Any further clues to the clueless warmly accepted.<br>
