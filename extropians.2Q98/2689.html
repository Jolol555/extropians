<p>
It definitely appears to be true in at least some cases.<br>
<p>
For one thing, the more I learn about the kosher laws, the culture and <br>
technology surrounding their formulation, and various health and economic <br>
aspects of the situation, the more sense they make.<br>
<p>
One specific example: the prohibition on eating pork.  If you can't eat pork, pigs <br>
are vermin to be exterminated.  There is a health aspect here, that they didn't <br>
have the technology to reliably thoroughly cook pork, and their general <br>
sanitation was not up to modern industrial standards either, so trichinosis <br>
would probably be a serious problem.  But there is also an economic factor: <br>
essentially anything a pig can eat, a human can eat, and the human will get <br>
energy from it more efficiently if it isn't filtered through a pig first.<br>
<p>
Another example: the draining of blood from slaughtered animals.  They didn't <br>
have refrigeration.  Blood goes bad *much* faster than meat does.<br>
