<i>&gt; that was the case then venus should be similar.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; First I ever heard of the moon's influence keeping the core molten...assuming</i><br>
<i>&gt; I understand this correctly.</i><br>
<p>
While there is some heating from radioactive decay, such decay should over time<br>
decrease on a half life basis, yet the rate of thermal conduction from within the<br>
earth has remained rather steady, or declining at a very low rate. Since we now<br>
know that the earth's EM field, which protects us from cosmic and solar radiation,<br>
is generated by a dynamo mechanism within the earth that is created by the tidal<br>
influence of the moon, and we can measure this influence, we can also measure the<br>
amount of heat generated by the moons tide creating friciton, and thus heat,<br>
within the earth. For example, we now know that the mantle and outer lithosphere<br>
rotate one more day per year than the core does, and it is this slippage between<br>
the layers that makes the earth behave like a big electric generator, with the<br>
core being the rotor, and the mantle being the stator.<br>

<i>&gt; My own understanding of this is that Venus does not have plate tectonics</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it does not have a well defined crust.  A lot is still unknown about</i><br>
<i>&gt; Venus, but it appears the surface is too hot for a brittle crust like Earth's.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The high temperature and pressure of the atmosphere does cause the crust<br>
materials to be much stronger than they would be at earth normal pressure and<br>
temp, which is why mountains have been found to be so steep on Venus, much more so<br>
than rock on earth could withstand, however Venus also has a thicker lithosphere<br>
than the earth does, which could explain why it doesn't have such plate tectonics.<br>
Why does it have such thick crust? Probably because it hasn't had the moon to keep<br>
it well stirred for billions of years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've never heard of the idea of tidal forces having much to do with plate</i><br>
<i>&gt; tectonics since seafloor spreading was discovered in the early 1960s (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; so?).  Wegener's original theory of continental drift posited tidal forces as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cause of drift.  Modern (post-1960) theories of plate tectonics -- e.g.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; plate mosaic theory, which appears to be the current conventional wisdom</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- posit convection in the mantle as the proximate cause of plate movement.</i><br>
<p>
Plate tectonic movements over time are, prima, caused by the upwelling convection<br>
currents of magma within the upper mantle spreading them apart. However, since all<br>
continents were at one time a single supercontinent, which significantly perturbed<br>
the center of gravity of the earth, it would take much greater forces than simple<br>
upwellings to break them apart. Keep in mind that there are plenty of volcanos,<br>
like Hawaii, as well as the large single volcano detected on Venus, which are<br>
caused by magma upwelling convections which are not at spreading zones.<br>
<p>
The most likely original cause of the breakup of Pangea was a conflict between the<br>
earth's center of gravity, the earth's center of rotation, and the center of<br>
angular momentum in the earth/moon system. As it is, the center of angular<br>
momentum is at least a couple kilometers off center from the current center of the<br>
earth, and it is this asymmetry which maintains the core/mantle dynamo that<br>
generates the earth's EM field.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Earth's moon appears to not have plates because it does not possess</i><br>
<i>&gt; a the same kind of highly convective mantle as Earth.  Ditto for Mars.</i><br>
<p>
Granted a planet with a cooler mantle would not have the elasticity required to<br>
support either theory, however, we can see that Jupiter's moon Io has extensive<br>
volcanos, indicating upwelling is present, and is under one of the highest levels<br>
of tidal influence in the solar system. While Mars, with no significant moons has<br>
a few large extremely dead volcanos, and Venus has one large volcano, the two most<br>
volcanically active planets/planetoids in the solar system share two significant<br>
traits: they are both under a significant amount of tidal stress, and they both<br>
have heavy metallic cores.<br>
<p>
Convection is a side effect of tidal stresses.<br>
