I'm an atheist who was raised as a Catholic and spent a bit of time reading<br>
in theology and mysticism.  It seems to me that what Max is saying here is<br>
*way* too easy.<br>
<p>
The claims for a deity of the Judeo-Christian-Muslim variety are far<br>
stronger than the utterances of a lone lunatic hallucinating an invisible<br>
elf.  Mystical experiences, which tend to be excluded or invalidated by<br>
those who've never had them, are frequently conceptualised and framed in<br>
terms that take language to its very boundaries.  But so too do QT and much<br>
of mathematics.  Besides, like concepts of infinity and physical<br>
singularities, deity can be teased out of our sense of the world's limits<br>
in a special way utterly unlike delusions or even the indwelling<br>
`life-force' or gods of animist belief systems.  We need to give our<br>
metaphysical foes credit for the depth and subtlety of their claims.  (BTW,<br>
to me *every* cognitive structure is metaphysical; I'm not using the term<br>
as a swear word.)<br>
