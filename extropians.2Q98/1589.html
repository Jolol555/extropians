<i>&gt; Computer Technology (Processing, Interface,</i><br>
Software, Networks):<br>
<p>
These will disappear ... swallowed by The Wall (AKA<br>
TV) ... ubiquitous ... only a few AI techs will<br>
recall the quaint terms "megabyte" and "megahertz".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Communication Technology:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a BLS news summary of April 16, 1998: "In its</i><br>
first major study of the economic effect of the<br>
Internet, the Commerce Department says that Net<br>
traffic is doubling every 100 days, and electronic<br>
commerce should reach $300 billion by 2002. More than<br>
100 million people are now on line, according to the<br>
wide-ranging report. The 'digital economy' is growing<br>
at double the rate of the overall economy and<br>
represents more than 8 percent of the gross domestic<br>
product, it said."<br>
<p>
Still, it looks like the old material economy is<br>
still keeping a spike in the swell of the digital<br>
economy, for a while yet ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science &amp;</i><br>
Technology:<br>
<p>
One response says "no effect on everyday life", but I<br>
agree with others who see prospects for big advances<br>
in slowing brain degradation in the elderly, perhaps<br>
allowing this growing segment of the population to<br>
continue productively contributing their vast stores<br>
of knowledge, not to mention their well-tempered<br>
reason (but conservative biases as well..) to the<br>
advancement of society.  Helpfully (because their<br>
numbers will decline ;) religious Puritans will<br>
resist these drugs &amp; technologies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Genetic Science and Technology:</i><br>
<p>
Weekend <a href="news:">news:</a> "accord gives the project enormous<br>
genetic sequencing capacity and could trim years off<br>
the current timetable for making a map of the human<br>
genome". Still, it's going to take many more years to<br>
explore the back country of this map, even with the<br>
help of robust AI - which might even finally emerge<br>
from this area.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Manufacturing and Materials Science &amp; Technology</i><br>
<p>
Last week's <a href="news:">news:</a> Susan Warren writes about "Whatever<br>
Happened to the Buckyball?" in the May 4th WSJ noting<br>
how "Buckyballs [STILL] cost $11k and up per pound"<br>
but they'd need to drop to $2.5k per pound to be<br>
useful for pharmaceuticals, $680/lb for catalysts,<br>
$100/lb for optical materials, and $15/lb or less for<br>
most other materials applications.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Business &amp; Finance Technology and Practice:</i><br>
<p>
The key economic statistic, productivity, "slowed<br>
sharply in the 1st qtr", supposedly "a reminder that<br>
it is still an open question whether the U.S. economy<br>
can sustain vigorous expansion with low inflation". I<br>
work at BLS and am convinced that these productivity<br>
figures are pretty meaningless.  Yet, the Business<br>
Council uses these to promote slower growth, hoping<br>
this will inspire the Fed not to raise interest<br>
rates. Here we see that quaint notions and political<br>
pressure from entrenched rate-sensitive industries<br>
are conspiring to keep us saddled with slow-growth,<br>
status-quo macroeconomic policies.<br>
<p>
Also, today's WSJ "Outlook" column deals with "Fixing<br>
[the] Tower of Babel In Global Accounting", something<br>
essential so that corporations can list on any stock<br>
market world-wide and open the global economy to<br>
investors everywhere.  However, count on things going<br>
slowly here because "they create thorny political and<br>
regulatory problems" for the Nanny-State.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From another front-page WSJ article today, headlined</i><br>
"Growing Up": "The emphasis on mergers is as much a<br>
reflection of the stock market these days as it is of<br>
the telecomm industry: What junk bonds were to the<br>
takeover-crazed 1980s, muscle-bound stock deals are<br>
to the merger mania of the late 1990s".<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, 737s are being grounded to check for<br>
wiring problems - time for a nap in the terminal...<br>
<p>

"And the seasons, they go round and round, and the<br>
painted ponies go up and down, we're captured on a<br>
carousel of time. We can't return, we can only look<br>
behind from where we've been, and go round and round<br>
and round in the circle game" - Old Popular Song<br>
(that, unfortunately, keeps repeating in my mind this<br>
morning...)<br>
