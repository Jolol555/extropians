<i>&gt; From:          "Lee Daniel Crocker" &lt;lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net (none)&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Since *any* publisher can do this, the *first* publisher will pay no </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more than his anticipated first day sales, minus the cost of setting </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; up the production run and a reasonable profit.  Let's assume it's a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; massively advertised book from a major author.  An expected best </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; seller.  Put that in real terms: an expected best-seller paperback </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has a first-print run of a million copies or less for the US, which </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; print run is expected to last for three months.  So figure 100,000 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; copies on the first day.  (As it happens, 100,000 is also a common </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; size print run.)  The publisher sells the books for, say, $2 each, so </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; he gets $200,000.  He's spent $100,000 advertising it, and $75,000 on </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; printing and distribution.  Since he gets *all* the risk, he wants </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most of the profit.  So the author gets $5,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Remember, this is an expected best-seller from a major author.  And </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this is ALL the author will ever get for writing that book.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Today, if you have never sold a novel before and a publisher offers </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you a $5,000 advance, you should probably keep looking for a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; publisher.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The number of completely groundless assumptions in this analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt; are too many to count.  First, the idea that the author only makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; money from sales of his book is idiotic.  He is much more valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; than that; he can sell his presence, his expertise, his skill,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the consumer attention of his name, /and/ his labor in a thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; other ways that authors today don't take advantage of because</i><br>
<i>&gt; their publishers are too lazy and unimaginative to see them.</i><br>
<p>
I defy you to name ONE such way that is not already in use.<br>
<p>
But some people who write books, DON'T want to become TV stars.<br>
<p>
And, by eliminating intellectual property, you eliminate many of <br>
these ways.  Because many of them are based on identity as the <br>
author, but the author has no more legal claim to that identity than <br>
anyone else.  There would be nothing in law to stop you from taking a <br>
pseudonym that happens to be the name on the cover of a book written <br>
by someone else, and going around giving speeches as if you had <br>
written it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; second assumption is that the startup cost to a second publisher</i><br>
<i>&gt; is minimal; that too isn't true, because in a world without the</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem of copyright, authors will seek the publisher that can</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce works most efficently</i><br>
<p>
In a world without copyright, authors will seek what they seek today: <br>
the publisher that will likely generate the most revenue while being <br>
reasonable (according to the author's standards) on other issues.<br>
<p>
The startup cost to a second publisher, absent copyright, is:<br>
<p>
(1) buy a copy that was published by the first publisher;<br>
<p>
(2) feed the pages into a copy machine, of appropriate <br>
sort and sophistication for the size of the production run.<br>
<p>
(3) bind the results.<br>
<p>
(4) deliver and sell the copies to a local bookstore for less than <br>
the original publisher's wholesale price.<br>
<p>
Notice what you *don't* see here:<br>
<p>
* advertising the book<br>
<p>
* paying the author<br>
<p>
* reading the slushpile to decide what's worth publishing<br>
<p>
Those items -- that the first publisher pays but the second publisher <br>
doesn't -- typically cost more than printing and binding the first <br>
print run, which is paid by both the first publisher and the second <br>
publisher.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or those who have consumer respect</i><br>
<i>&gt; and attention that their competitors lack, so the risk of</i><br>
<i>&gt; competition is lessened.  A third assumption is that the second</i><br>
<i>&gt; publisher will have no use for the author's services, but will</i><br>
<i>&gt; just reprint the original work.  A business that stupid would</i><br>
<i>&gt; last about five minutes.</i><br>
<p>
Why?  You are assuming that the original publisher is paying the <br>
author to do all these wonderful things; so you must assume that <br>
they are being done even if the second publisher *doesn't* pay the <br>
author to do them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Consumers want the latest, the best;</i><br>
<i>&gt; they want information customized to their needs.  The author is</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the best position to do that, even after initial publication.</i><br>
<p>
Please explain how this applies to a typical romance novel.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What makes you think the idea of "books" as the preferred medium</i><br>
<i>&gt; of information sales is even a good idea to begin with?</i><br>
<p>
There are few people with access to a wider variety of text media <br>
than I.<br>
<p>
For casual reading, I prefer books because of portability, <br>
flexibility, weight, and print quality.<br>
<p>
For technical reading and reference, I prefer books because of <br>
portability, flexibility, print quality, and the ability to have a <br>
large number of large items visible simultaneously.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anytime people claim that a law is "necessary", what they really</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean is that they don't have the imagination to see how the free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market would solve the same problem--if a problem exists--or</i><br>
<i>&gt; else they don't have the courage to do it in the free market.</i><br>
<p>
Some of us don't think a man's labor is worthless simply because the <br>
essence of his production is non-material.<br>
<p>
We will agree to eliminating the protection of intellectual property <br>
the same day we agree to eliminating the protection of physical <br>
property -- including the laws against murder.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Copyrights do nothing but reward duplication and mediocrity at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the expense of true creativity and artistry.</i><br>
<p>
Why, then, do nations with meaningful copyright laws have MORE <br>
creativity and artistry than nations without -- and the artists <br>
better rewarded?<br>
<p>
In fact, copyrights PROTECT creativity and artistry AGAINST <br>
duplication and mediocrity.<br>
