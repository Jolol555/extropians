But it's that other 20% that has all the fun and controversy.  What if you can<br>
screw people without their finding out about it?  What if you're vastly more<br>
powerful than they are?  I.e., you're a Power.  Or more currently<br>
realistically, you're a member of a well definable group such that you're<br>
confident other members won't prey on you and you all are collective strong<br>
enough to prey upon others.  Such as Europeans invading the Americas, or Bantu<br>
farmers driving out hunter-gatherers, or the repeated Indo-Europeans invasions<br>
of Europe, from the Celts to the Goths, or the Draka.  Egoism and<br>
utilitarianism agree a lot better when the other egos have about as much power<br>
as your ego to begin with.<br>
