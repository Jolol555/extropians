<i>&gt; This is a badly written, self congradulating press release, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; sounds like they've got a completely different approach to encryption.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And if you're smarter than them, they'll pay you 1.2 million bucks.</i><br>
<p>
Their "detailed description" is mathematical-sounding bullshit<br>
and absolutely fraudulent claims.  Their money is safe, though,<br>
because their system is trivially unbreakable in the same way<br>
a one-time pad is, because their method contains no key exchange<br>
or distribution method; this has been known for centuries.<br>
<p>
Any idiot can make an uncrackable cipher, and you don't need<br>
the pile of algorithms these guys yammer on about--you just need<br>
a plastic decoder ring and a safe way to exchange keys.  It is<br>
public key distribution where are the interesting stuff is.<br>
These guys are con artists preying on the public's ignorance of<br>
this fact.<br>
