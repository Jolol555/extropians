I know what you mean by the first part of the above, but I think the way<br>
you put it could be misleading. The Principles are not big on "we believe",<br>
except in the most general sense. The Extropian Principles -- by my<br>
deliberate design -- do *not* specify particular beliefs. They only express<br>
a few general attitudes and approaches and values that Extropians hold. It<br>
is not intended as a system of beliefs. The idea is to present a coherent<br>
grouping of attitudes and values without restricting the specific beliefs<br>
of Extropians. Thus, the Principles do not say which methods Extropian<br>
should use to extend life, they do not say that Extropians should sign up<br>
for cryonics, they do not specify the details of a economic or political<br>
system, they do not specify how an operating system should be designed for<br>
maximum intelligence, etc.<br>
<p>
The lack of "why we believe" is also deliberate. There will be a continuing<br>
healthy disagreement about why each of us holds these values and attitudes.<br>
I have no interest in pushing Extropians into a particular way or reason<br>
for holding these values. Some of us see these values as utterly arbitrary<br>
-- just ones we happen to prefer; others of us think that these values can<br>
be objectively validated; others think values lie somewhere in between<br>
these extremes. Some of us think that knowledge is based on certain,<br>
axiomatic foundations, others take a pancritical rationalist approach.<br>
<p>
This absence of specifying "why we believe" or the details of "what we<br>
believe" is a feature, not a bug! I intended that from the start as a<br>
preventive measure against dogmatism (something that can threaten any<br>
philosophy of life). (That's also one reason why the dishonest use of<br>
"cult" in regard to Extropian thinking pisses me off so much!)<br>
<p>
Discussion of these specific questions among us is a good thing, but I want<br>
to make sure that we understand that the Principles do not and should not<br>
attempt to define these answers.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
