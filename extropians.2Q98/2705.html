<i>&gt;  This is NOT radical right-wing paranoia. Most of the elements of the new</i><br>
<i>&gt;  proposed national ID system are already in place NOW. The next step is for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  all information to be coordinated and completely accessible to any and all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bureaucrats for their arbitrary and capricious abuse.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The national ID card itself (which you will be required to carry) will have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a magnetic strip (or chip) which is imbedded in it. That means YOU (when you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have your mandated national ID card on your person) could be tracked</i><br>
<i>&gt;  wherever you go. Privacy will be an anachronism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Other cards that have magnetic strips: credit cards, ATM cards, hotel keys,</i><br>
<i>&gt; appt keys, et al.  The magnetic strips can't be used to somehow follow your</i><br>
<i>&gt; movements.</i><br>
<p>
Oh yes they can. Credit card and debit card purchases directly access nationwide<br>
financial databases. Authorities have the ability to put 'sniffers' on these<br>
systems to track people by their purchase locations. This applies to hotels,<br>
restaurants, etc. In fact,  my bank was able to track me down while I was on<br>
vacation last month to notify me of an account problem. Its kind of odd to get a<br>
phone call from your personal banker while having after dinner coffee......500<br>
miles away from home.... I shiver at the thought that some government fascist<br>
might track me down and drag me away merely by my participation in the economy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But the author of the article seems more interested in propogating</i><br>
<i>&gt; a juvenile kind of paranoia than paying much attention to the benefits of such</i><br>
<i>&gt; a system or to the fact that the system really doesn't add any new powers to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government but only makes the government more efficient.</i><br>
<p>
Total BS. It makes to government more efficient at tracking people down, as well<br>
as knowing everything about the people they are tracking down. The minute a<br>
fascist/totalitarian party takes over, the mechanisms will be in place for them to<br>
commit intercontinental genocide in a matter of hours.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In any immensely</i><br>
<i>&gt; large and complex society such as ours a standardized identification system</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes perfect sense.  And the presence of it simply has nothing to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt; government encroachment of anyone's rights.  It DOES have to do with making</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government more efficient.  The place to protect rights, however, is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the courts and the legislatures, and NOT upon the assumption of governmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; inefficiency in enforcing its laws.</i><br>
<p>
Again, BS. As said by many great plitical philosophers and leaders in history:<br>
"That government governs best which governs least." Hindering the government's<br>
ability to be tempted by such powers are necessary. Giving such absolute power<br>
over the individual's privacy to a priviledged few in the bureaucracy is the most<br>
corrupting potential in government. Privacy should be controlled by the<br>
individual, not by the government. Assuming that government will 'do the right<br>
thing' with your personal information is assuming once too much.<br>
