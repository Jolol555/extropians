<p>
   IAN: Dan, over the span of about 5 posts, you've<br>
   continually failed to accurately represent what I<br>
   am saying so blatantly as to exceed belief. I am <br>
   NOT saying A is larger as seen by B nor am I say-<br>
   ing that A is larger relative to A -- which are <br>
   the only two cases you allow me to make (that<br>
   I don't), both of which are manifestly false. <br>
<p>
   That I'm not saying what you say I say couldn't <br>
   be clearer, I have even provided illustrations <br>
   showing that each sees the other's ruler SHRINK<br>
   and each sees its ruler LARGER than the others.<br>
<p>
   Just because you choose to omit data from your <br>
   analysis does not make your analysis correct, <br>
   in fact it makes it a false net measurement.<br>
   It's your fallacy of "partial difference."<br>
<p>
   You seem to be under the impression that your <br>
   scenario has violated the symmetry of measure,<br>
   that A measures "smaller" free from reference <br>
   to something "larger" than the smaller. There <br>
   are 2 observers that can make 4 valid measure-<br>
   ments, that's 8 measurements in all, but your <br>
   chart only includes half of them, as you say:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, here are ALL of the measurements you have available to you:</i><br>
<i>&gt;A measuring A: 0</i><br>
<i>&gt;A measuring B: - (never +, uses A's ruler!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;B measuring B: 0</i><br>
<i>&gt;B measuring A: -</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: That's half, here are all measurments:<br>
<p>
  After B passed by A near the speed of light,<br>
  A filled out this chart of all differences:<br>
<p>
             A  B<br>
            ______<br>
         A | 0 -1 |<br>
<i>           |      |</i><br>
         B | 1  0 |<br>
           --------<br>
<p>
  (AA) Difference between A and A = 0<br>
  (AB) Difference between A and B = A is  1 larger<br>
  (BA) Difference between B and A = B is -1 smaller<br>
  (BB) Difference between B and B = 0<br>
<p>
<p>
  Observer B measured these differences:<br>
<p>
             A  B<br>
            ______<br>
         A | 0  1 |<br>
<i>           |      |</i><br>
         B |-1  0 |<br>
           --------<br>
<p>
  (AA) Difference between A and A = 0<br>
  (AB) Difference between A and B = A is -1 smaller<br>
  (BA) Difference between B and A = B is  1 larger<br>
  (BB) Difference between B and B = 0<br>
<p>
  Because a measure of relative size is simply a <br>
  measure of difference, we could've ascertained <br>
  a priori that the change in size would sum to<br>
  0 by observing that as a rule, the sum of<br>
  all differences between all numerical <br>
  measurements always equals zero:<br>
<p>
            0  1  2  3<br>
           ____________<br>
        0 | 0  1  2  3 |<br>
<i>          |            |</i><br>
        1 |-1  0  1  2 |<br>
<i>          |            |</i><br>
        2 |-2 -1  0  1 |<br>
<i>          |            |</i><br>
        3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |<br>
          --------------<br>
