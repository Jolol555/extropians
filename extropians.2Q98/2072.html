Yes, this is a great example of how IP can actually work in the future.<br>
Even among 'warz haqrz' the demand for the very latest 'day 0' software is<br>
massive.  Art and technology go hand in hand in our desire to have the<br>
latest and best.  However I would probably come down on the 'open source'<br>
side more than Max does.<br>
<p>
Even with your subscription software, the delay to the pirate market is<br>
still small.  You have a better chance than current methods simply because<br>
your greater efficiency gives you a lower price and therefore makes it a<br>
less attractive target for piracy.<br>
<p>
The big winners in the open source model are those who offer commercial<br>
support contracts for their 'free, unsupported software'.  No-one can ever<br>
pirate the experience and knowledge of the authors, and software is too<br>
complex and commercial liabilities too large for support services to become<br>
obsolete in the near term.<br>
<p>
It is not still up to these people to prove that their open source can make<br>
them a lot of money... What do you suppose Linus Torvalds is earning at his<br>
new job ?  What about Phil Zimmerman ?<br>
There are lots of examples of this.  None of them expect that their personal<br>
business model will leave them short of a dollar for a long time to come,<br>
regardless of where technology and law end up.  We should be looking to them<br>
for the models that will work.<br>

is<br>

out<br>

you<br>

not<br>

<i>&gt;Well that's only if we keep viewing programs as finished blocks of code</i><br>
<i>&gt;like it is now. If instead we view it as evolving systems, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;upgrades/updates in realtime. Then there's suddenly a very god</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility of copy protection of software. What if you made some</i><br>
<i>&gt;software that people really wants which upgrades via the net by the use</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a serial number. Then there would be good reasons to "subscribe" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the software. It would be easy to close down a number that updated too</i><br>
<i>&gt;many times and from too many places.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also it would be both possible and wise to rent out this kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;software more inexpensively than software currently is. As any good</i><br>
<i>&gt;bussinesman can tell you. The easiest customer to get is a return</i><br>
<i>&gt;customer. This would furthermore discourage from pirating due to the low</i><br>
<i>&gt;price.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think there is far to much emphasis on open source, and the free</i><br>
<i>&gt;software on the net. Of course theres Linux, but it's still a fringe</i><br>
<i>&gt;product, And the few good examples of open source doesn't make for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;complete change in the way of the world. Netscape btw. still has to</i><br>
<i>&gt;prove that their open way of doing things is better than Microsofts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Naturally distribution systems and pricing will change, but most of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;software will still cost money. We will might not buy it in big dead</i><br>
<i>&gt;lumps like today but more like a flexible subscription.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Freeware, and open source will coexist together with traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;of-the-shelf products, and any other way we can concieve selling and</i><br>
<i>&gt;distributing software.</i><br>
