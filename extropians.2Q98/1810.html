  IAN: The article quoted above noted that a taxi was<br>
  used to eliminate the possibily of auditory clues<br>
  causes by a dog's familiarity with its owners car.<br>
<p>
  I can see it now PSYCHIC DOG NETWORKS! "Don't be fooled<br>
  by other psychic-dog services, only PDN uses real psychic<br>
  dogs, yes that's right REAL psychic dogs! Call now for your<br>
  free 2 minute consultation. Just ask Rover anything and he'll<br>
  give you the answer, the answer YOUR looking for. 2 barks means<br>
  "yes" and 1 bark means "no." What have you got to loose? Call NOW!<br>
<p>
  1-900-RUF-RUFF"<br>
<p>
  This could really cut the overhead for those psychic "services"<br>
  since they could just have tape recorders attached to the phones<br>
  programmed to select either a 1 or 2 bark recording after the <br>
  caller's voices pauses for a few seconds, indicating that a<br>
  question was just asked and the caller is waiting for the <br>
  reply. A slight delay would even induce the impression <br>
  that the dog was accessing the "inner-psychic channels."<br>
<p>
  Personally, I think that those psychic networks skirt or<br>
  totally breach the standard of fraud, but enforcing such<br>
  a case against them would be so difficult since the nature<br>
  of the "product" they "supply" is so intangible. I think <br>
  it simply comes  down to, the dumb will just be ripped off.<br>
  Playing slot machines is even smarter than calling "psychics."<br>
