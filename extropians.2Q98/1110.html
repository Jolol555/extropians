Possibly such story came from an ancient people who lived in a small island<br>
having a great depression at its center :)))  this was ALL THE WORLD !!!!<br>
After that, they simply went to a continental land, maybe near India ( now<br>
seriously: Do you know the hindu story of MAHABHARATA ????)<br>
