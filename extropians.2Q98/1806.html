Information is not a product, nor can it be treated as same.  The<br>
provision of information is a service, not a sale of consumable goods.<br>
Your position is like saying that if I light a fire, and then sell you<br>
some, and then you give/sell fire to your friends, you've stolen my fire.<br>
<p>
Similarly, your argument that intellectual property is stolen when copied<br>
is valid but unsound; as you should already realize, I am opposed to the<br>
premise that the right of other people to make copies of a piece of<br>
information could be lawfully owned.  Also, with respect to coercion, if<br>
there were no intellectual prpoerty rights, then an inventor who knew this<br>
and created a product anyway must necessarily be aware of the fact that<br>
his transaction has positive externalities.  If the inventor created<br>
anyway, then the action is voluntary; the inventor accepts the fact that<br>
other people would benefit from his/her work.  This is simply stating the<br>
trivial fact that if there were no property, there would be no "theft," in<br>
the technical sense.  This is not a valid reason to eliminate property,<br>
however.  Indeed, I maintain that we should enforce property rights in<br>
such a way as to maximize economic efficiency.  For example, take a look<br>
at: <br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter">http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter</a><br>
43.html<br>
<p>
Which is chapter 43 of David Friednman's _Machinery of Freedom_, arguing<br>
for the enforcement of only economically efficient property rights.  I<br>
intend to argue that intellectual property rights are NOT economically<br>
efficent, and for that reason should not be enforced as law.<br>
<p>
As Friedman notes, the Coase theorem states that if transaction costs are<br>
zero, externalities will be handled efficiently; that is, in this case, if<br>
transaction costs were zero, the inventor could simply say "OK, world. <br>
I've got my idea.  I'll tell everyone who wants to make a product with it,<br>
all at once, if you all pay me your fair share in doing so."  Clearly this<br>
cannot happen due to the fact that transaction costs are high; trying to<br>
arrange such a bargain would be particularly difficult, especially<br>
considering that you would have to provide provisions to correct for those<br>
who would hold out on the deal, cheat, etc. <br>
<p>
In reality, one of two things might happen: either we might enforce<br>
intellectual property, and as a result pay the high cost of trying to<br>
enforce these laws (especially high over the Internet, where copying is<br>
easy, anonymity cheap and encryption ubiquitious) as well as the<br>
deadweight loss resulting from monopoly, or we should suffer<br>
inefficiencies as inventors are not paid quite as much as they are worth<br>
to society, resulting in a naturally lower price for invention, and thus<br>
some deadweight loss as inventors produce fewer inventions than they<br>
otherwise would.<br>
<p>
Now, if we accept an economic analysis of law, then the question we should<br>
be asking ourselves is: what form of intellectual property rights, if any,<br>
is economically efficient?  I say that enforcing intellectual property<br>
rights is more expensive than it is worth; while both result in deadweight<br>
losses, if we presume that the supply curve for COPIES of the information<br>
(or products produced using the idea) would be fairly elastic, a<br>
reasonable presumption considering the ease of copying these days, the<br>
halving of marginal revenues for monopolies would result in drastic<br>
reductions in quantity, by up to 50% as the supply curve approaches total<br>
elasticity.  Chances are something closer to 40% of the market is lost<br>
thanks to monopolization.  And this doesn't yet consider the cost of<br>
enforcement.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, without intellectual property, these enforcement costs<br>
would vanish; the only deadweight loss would be that from undervalued<br>
invention.  While it is difficult to estimate precisely HOW undervalued<br>
the price would be, as it would depend on the percentage of the<br>
marketplace with which inventors would be able to sign a contract, it is<br>
not immediately apparent that the inventor faces either a high or a low<br>
elasticity in supply of ideas; I'd guess that it is probably not so<br>
inelastic as the supply of copies is elastic.  Even if I am not precisely<br>
right on this point, however, intellectual property is still not worth<br>
enforcing if the deadweight loss due to undervaluing invention MINUS the<br>
cost of enforcing intellectual property (a non-trivial value) is less than<br>
the deadweight loss due to monopolization.  That is, even if the cost of<br>
undervaluing inventions were greater than the cots of monoplization, it<br>
still wouldn't necessarily be efficent to enforce intellectual property<br>
because you would have to add on the cost of actually ENFORCING the law.<br>
<p>
In this case, I don't think it's possible to make a reasonable case that<br>
enforcing intellectual property rights eliminates more economic deadweight<br>
loss than it costs, especially considering that it very likely ADDS to<br>
economic inefficiency rather than reduces it, even if the cost of<br>
enforcement were free.  I am anxious to see how or if you can show me to<br>
be wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, you are still ignoring my question as to why I or anyone should invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; something to benefit others without our say so as to who can benefit freely from it</i><br>
<i>&gt; and who pays. Anything less is theft.</i><br>
<p>
Theft does not exist where property rights do not exist.  In the same way,<br>
a feudal lord is not breaking the law when he exploits his serfs;<br>
rather he defines the law in such a way as to make his actions legal.  I<br>
agree that his actions SHOULD be illegal, but not because it's theft, but<br>
because rigged laws are economically inefficient, and thus fail to maxmize<br>
utility.  In contrast, I argue that intellectual property should not be<br>
enforced, because doing so is not ecnomically efficent, and therefore<br>
fails to maximize utility.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; All you are doing is akin to an attempt to legislate PI to equal 3.</i><br>
<p>
Seems to me that this line could be used by anyone against anyone who<br>
disagrees with them politically.  Empty rhetoric, I say; I could just as<br>
well say the same thing to you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Get off your</i><br>
<i>&gt; subjectivist, post modern butt and pay for what you use. No free lunches.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I'm no subjectivist, nor am I politically postmodern.  Politically, I am a<br>
libertarian, and I justify my views through utilitarian principles.  I<br>
support property rights because they are better for us than socialism, not<br>
because they are objectively morally right.  I am also fully prepared to<br>
pay for my choice of property rights in the deadweight loss which would<br>
result from economic inefficiency.  Are you prepared to pay the cost of<br>
enforcing a bad law?  Or were you looking for that free lunch yourself? <br>
