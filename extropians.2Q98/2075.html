Title<br>
  The effect of phytohaemagglutinin at different dietary concentrations on the<br>
  growth, body composition and plasma insulin of the rat.<br>

Abstract<br>
  Young growing rats weighing approximately 83 g were fed on diets containing<br>
  kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) lectin (phytohaemagglutinin, PHA) in the<br>
  range of 0-0.45 g/kg body weight for 10 d to ascertain whether there was a<br>
  minimum dose below which the lectin had no significant effect on body and<br>
  skeletal muscle weights in comparison with pair-fed lectin-free controls.<br>
  Averaged over all experiments, PHA doses of less than 10 mg/d (0.12 g/kg body<br>
  weight) reduced body dry by 1.14 (SE 0.25) g when compared with controls.<br>
  Between 10 and 27 mg/d (0.12-0.32 g/kg body weight) a further reduction of<br>
  0.64 (SE 0.21) g occurred, suggesting a slight but steady decline of body dry<br>
  weight with increasing dose. However, above 27 mg/d the depression of growth<br>
  and changes in body composition accelerated. The difference between the<br>
  proportional losses of skeletal muscle and body weight was not significant at<br>
  doses of PHA below 10 mg/d (0.12 g/kg body weight) but the ratio of these<br>
  losses rose to 1.5-2.0 at doses above this. The proportional decrease in<br>
  lipid weight exceeded that of both body and skeletal muscle weights at all<br>
  lectin doses, suggesting that lipid catabolism was the first target of the<br>
  PHA effect. Plasma insulin level was depressed at the PHA dose of 0.02 g/kg<br>
  body weight at which growth depression and muscle atrophy were minimal but,<br>
  contrary to expectations, plasma glucose levels remained stable over the<br>
  whole PHA dose range. It appears that despite a PHA-induced lowering of blood<br>
  insulin, glucose catabolism is elevated by an unknown, possibly hormonal,<br>
  compensatory mechanism. Thus, because low insulin levels facilitate the<br>
  mobilization and catabolism of lipids, it may be possible to use low doses of<br>
  PHA to reduce hyperglycaemia and body fat.<br>
