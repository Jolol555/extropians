I don't know what Sontag has been up to lately, but I'm completely off of<br>
Camille Paglia, who I used to admire, for three reasons:  (1) her refusal to<br>
acknowledge the value of any scientific approach to studying the human<br>
condition, insisting that we take our lessons from literature and<br>
philosophy;  (2) her predictable opposition to any attempt to improve or<br>
change the human condition;  and (3) her recent attack on Youth Pride and<br>
concurrent denunciation of a five-year youth suicide study.  She has indeed<br>
brought her politics to bear in the case of Youth Pride, because her<br>
comments make it obvious that she did not bother to find out any hard facts<br>
about the organization but rather based them on her political opposition to<br>
the gay movement in general.  <br>
<p>
For a while I thought she provided a refreshing counter to feminism, but,<br>
having read all of her latest writings, I have concluded that she is not<br>
breaking any new ground but rather engaging in attacks on anyone else who<br>
attempts to do so.  This, of course, has been the strategy for maintaining<br>
many an academic career.<br>
