RE: &gt;&gt; but if you have to work for wage and must spend most of your<br>
wage for your survive you are not able to earn enough money to build up<br>
your own firm. Therefore you are forces to earn wage your hole life. &lt;&lt;<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, but the three people I named (among a great many others --</i><br>
some of whom immigrated to the United States, not speaking English,<br>
possessing only those resources they were able to keep while fleeing<br>
through the jungle or accumulate during years in refugee camps --<br>
you can't get much poorer than that) did precisely what you<br>
say cannot be done.<br>
Maybe you didn't recognise the names, though.<br>
 <br>
Ray Kroc was a milkshake-making-machine salesman and repairman, and<br>
from that start he created the McDonald's chain.<br>
Rich deVoss was a door-to-door soap salesman.  He owns half of Amway.<br>
<p>
Sam Walton sold various supplies to small-town general stores.  And<br>
created the WalMart chain. &lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
There is a new factor that isn't acknowledged in your argument above,<br>
and that is that our confiscatory tax system has grown immeasurably<br>
MORE confiscatory since the above gentleman were able to make their<br>
fortunes.  In other words, it is much more difficult nowadays, with<br>
greatly increased gov't taxation on our incomes and everything else<br>
within sight, to save enough to go into one's own business.  <br>
<p>
In addition, inflation by the Federal Reserve has eaten away the value<br>
of our money, drastically.  Just compare prices for a commodity from,<br>
say, the 50s to their present prices, and you will see just how much<br>
purchasing power the dollar has lost.  <br>
<p>
These facts would make the gentleman's argument more true than false,<br>
IMO.<br>
