*Eventually* yes, but not before the singularity, which is at least a<br>
couple of decades away. For the time being, the world remains to be<br>
devided among these "archaic" groups called nation states, and the only<br>
way to have a reasonably free lifestyle is to have your piece of<br>
territory. The bureaucratic structures are anything but dead, and<br>
ignoring their silly rules while on their turf will surely get you into<br>
trouble (try not to pay taxes, for example).<br>
