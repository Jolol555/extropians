<i>&gt; So you cannot be sure whether the number of intersexual babies has</i><br>
<i>&gt; increased. But how can you say that it is "most likely" a path of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; own evolution?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In which way would an intersexual be more fit to its (for lack of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;better pronoun) environment than its male or female friends?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Heterosexuality is a very important concept, both for reproduction and</i><br>
<i>&gt;socialization. Zoophilia, homosexuality, pedophilia, all these are</i><br>
<i>&gt;likely to have evolutionary origins, but I cannot see a possible use</i><br>
<i>&gt;for intersexuality.</i><br>
<p>
I think you take the word 'evolution' to literally here. It seems to<br>
be used a lot on this list instead of the dreaded and passé 'progress'<br>
or 'development'.<br>
<p>
I would rather say intersexuals might be important since their<br>
existence undermines the traditional (and IMHO unhealthy) binary view<br>
of gender. If more people are allowed to develop *their own* gender<br>
identity (and then correct their bodies to fit it) there will be less<br>
resistance to us who have developed a slightly different species<br>
identity and want to fix it...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; OK, so you believe that the kid's identity is impaired after</i><br>
<i>&gt; "fixing" his sexuality. Are there any psychological studies supporting</i><br>
<i>&gt; this view? I grant that it is difficult to do such studies if all</i><br>
<i>&gt; attempts are blocked because of such "bugfixes".</i><br>
<p>
I know Kathryn will likely have much more information on this, but it<br>
seems that at least of the some of the cases earlier reported as<br>
"successful" have turned out to have been mistakes. (Diamond, M.C. &amp;<br>
