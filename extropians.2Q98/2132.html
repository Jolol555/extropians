Extending health span with genetics<br>
<p>
Fruit fly find suggests approaches for keeping youthful vigor<br>
<p>
By Charlene Laino<br>
MSNBC<br>
<p>
June 1 —Canadian scientists reported Monday that they have successfully<br>
extended the life span of the fruit fly by inserting into its DNA a designer<br>
gene that prevented some of the cellular damage normally associated with<br>
aging. The approach holds potential for increasing humans’ health span —<br>
“our days of youthful vigor,” said researcher John Phillips of the<br>
University of Guelph.<br>
<p>
USING GENETIC ENGINEERING techniques, an extra gene was inserted into the<br>
fruit fly’s motor neurons — nerve cells that control movement — boosting<br>
their ability to remove toxins from the body and extending their life span<br>
by 40 percent.<br>
       While an extra 30 days added to the normal 80-day life span of a<br>
fruit fly might sound insignificant, the find has enormous implications for<br>
biology, Phillips said.<br>
       “We have discovered that [weakening of the detoxifying mechanism] in<br>
motor neurons is the Achilles heel of life span,” the Canadian scientist<br>
said.<br>
       Drug companies are already working on new pharmaceuticals targeted at<br>
the motor neurons that would work to increase our health span, he noted.<br>
       But perhaps even more importantly, the findings mark the first time<br>
researchers have shown that a single gene in a single type of cell can<br>
affect longevity.<br>
       “We were really surprised,” said study head Gabrielle Boulianne, a<br>
neurobiologist at the Hospital for Sick Children and a professor of<br>
molecular and medical genetics at the University of Toronto. “We now know<br>
that just manipulating just one gene, targeting one type of cell, has a huge<br>
impact on aging.<br>
       “Contrary to what was previously thought — that many different<br>
factors contribute to aging — it now appears that the process may be<br>
simpler,” Boulianne said.<br>
       The study is published in the June issue of the journal Nature<br>
Genetics.<br>
       The new research grew out of work showing that the efficiency with<br>
which organisms use oxygen directly correlates to their life span, Phillips<br>
said. Humans, who have the longest lives of any organism, are the most<br>
efficient users of oxygen, for example, while mice and hummingbirds, who<br>
have relatively short lives, are inefficient users.<br>
       The reason, he said, is that oxygen is very toxic. “Even at the 21<br>
percent atmospheric oxygen that we breathe, there has evolved a detoxifying<br>
mechanism without which we would all keel over and die,” Phillips explained.<br>
       Over the past decade, scientists have identified the genes<br>
responsible for this detoxifying mechanism. When this gene is made inactive<br>
via a human-made mutation in the fruit fly, Phillips said, its life span is<br>
reduced by some 80 percent to 90 percent.<br>
       At about the same time, researchers came to better understand that<br>
motor neurons are somehow associated with this detoxifying mechanism.<br>
Studies have shown that people with Lou Gehrig’s disease, a paralytic<br>
disorder that is caused by a loss of motor neurons, tend to have family<br>
members whose genes controlling oxygen detoxification are faulty, for<br>
example.<br>
       Moreover, in species ranging fruit flies to humans, there is evidence<br>
that loss of motor neuron function is a prominent feature of disease, aging<br>
and death, molecular biologist Phillips said. “We theorized that motor<br>
neurons might be at the nexus of aging and oxygen metabolism.”<br>
       That research led to the question: What would happen if we upgraded<br>
that detoxification defense mechanism? Would the organism live longer?<br>
       To answer the question, the team created a designer gene that would<br>
enhance oxygen detoxification in motor neurons.<br>
       The human-made gene was then added to the fruit fly’s normal genetic<br>
makeup.<br>
       The experiment worked. Not only did the gene help the motor neurons<br>
eliminate more waste, but the fruit flies they lived longer.<br>
       Drug companies are already working on new antioxidant formulas<br>
targeted at the motor neurons that work more efficiently in the nervous<br>
system to rid our bodies of toxins and increase our health span, Phillips<br>
said.<br>
       While some theorize that the approach could be used to create a pill<br>
that would let us all live 40 percent longer — boosting average age from 80<br>
to 110 — Phillips said that is not his intention. “There are too many social<br>
implications,” he said. “Already there are problems with old-age pensions,<br>
for example.”<br>
       Rather, the find can be used to help us live healthier, avoiding the<br>
sickness and disease normally associated with old age, he said.<br>
       “The way in which the approach extended the life span of the fruit<br>
fly is encouraging,” Phillips said. “Life span was extended though<br>
postponement of the onset of senescence.”<br>
       In other words, he said, we could live our final days not in a<br>
geriatric ward, but full of youthful energy.<br>
