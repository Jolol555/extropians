I discuss this problem in THE SPIKE, and suggest that we might take another<br>
look at Robert Theobald's 1960s' discussion (recently revived) for a<br>
minimum Guaranteed Income.  Libertarians will have problems with this<br>
notion, especially in the presumed need for a centralised or governmental<br>
agency to collect and redistribute the revenues.  Since we already have<br>
such structures in place, I believe the meliorative effects of shifting<br>
most social services to a GI structure would be appropriate and acceptable<br>
from various idelogical standpoints.  The core of my case is this:<br>
<p>
==============<br>
<p>
As an inviolable constitutional entitlement, a guaranteed income would<br>
offer people who'd been made technologically redundant the chance to engage<br>
in dignified self-help.  At present, it is difficult for jobless people to<br>
get a bank loan to start a small business, or buy and fix their house, or<br>
pay for the protracted study and skill development that might lever them<br>
back into still-vital parts of the work force.  `Further, and of<br>
potentially great significance' Cyert and Jacobs suggested, `a guaranteed<br>
minimum income would make it more feasible for private industry to sponsor<br>
long training programs, for it would no longer be necessary to pay<br>
substantial wages through the period of training and low productivity.'<br>
<p>
Theobald was more optimistic still.  Productive groups, which he termed<br>
`consentives', would come together on a voluntary basis, working simply<br>
because they wanted to.  Decades later, this is a pattern we recognise from<br>
garage bands, high-tech start-ups, and internet special interest groups.<br>
All those, of course, tend to be funded by doting, well-paid parents.<br>
Consentives might produce goods that embody, both in themselves and in the<br>
workers' sense of creative satisfaction, the virtues of hand-crafted design<br>
in a machine world, as brilliant shareware does today.  Since wages and<br>
salaries would be irrelevant, cost of goods would be minimal, hardly<br>
greater than raw materials and transport - comparable with computerised<br>
factory production.  The rise of nano minting, naturally enough, will make<br>
even these fond hopes passé, but cheap minting will not rise above the<br>
horizon for at least another decade or two.<br>
<p>
It's fair to judge that national investment in such a scheme might<br>
ultimately be much more than a costly exercise in humane<br>
conscience-salving, and perhaps preferable to continued post-Cold War<br>
military stock-piling and planned obsolescence.  Still, many will reject<br>
any redistribution  of national wealth, beyond a pittance paid for in<br>
humiliation.  Poverty, it's supposed, is a character defect.  Perhaps that<br>
claim was once true.  In the era of structural unemployment, it is no<br>
better than cant.  <br>
<p>
The work ethic (better, the job ethic) cannot survive long while a culture<br>
of machine abundance disintegrates mores - themselves only, at most, a few<br>
thousand years old - of austerity and fanatical toil.  It's undeniable,<br>
though, that a guaranteed income would run straight into the hostile<br>
defensiveness of the work ethic.  Societies remain stratified, after the<br>
fashion of a scarcity economy, according to the jobs its members hold.<br>
Since the policy of full employment is faltering and doomed, we must do an<br>
about-face and realise the merits of unemployment.  <br>
<p>
Fear of being out of a job has two roots that need no longer be axiomatic.<br>
One is the loss of adequate income.  The other is loss of meaningful<br>
activity.  Without the framework of discipline and satisfaction that brains<br>
and hands obtain from meaningful work, people start running amok with<br>
boredom, diverting themselves with the ancient, arbitrary and zestful<br>
customs of tribal hierarchy and conflict.  Force a generation of kids out<br>
of the loop, and expect them to trash your Porsche, murder each other, and<br>
burn out their furious grief with neurotoxins.<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<p>
The run up to the Spike, therefore, will deepen today's dreadful problems,<br>
but also ease their solution, if we keep our nerve and use our brains.  A<br>
corporation that downsizes its entire workforce in favour of robots<br>
survives as a parasite on the investment of the past.  Its earnings, after<br>
all, are the product of every erg of human effort that went into creating<br>
the economy and the technological culture which made those robots possible.<br>
 We need not see a guaranteed income as a natural right, in some absurd<br>
lofty a priori sense, like the supposed innate rights to freedom of speech<br>
and liberty.  No, it is an inheritance, something owed to all the children<br>
of a society whose ancestors for generations have together built, and<br>
purchased through their efforts, the resource base sustaining today's<br>
cornucopia.  <br>
