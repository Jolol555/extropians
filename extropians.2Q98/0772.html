   IAN: Not sure how much of what you say is joke <br>
   or not. I would say that the joke that the <br>
   phenomena of erosion is caused by disease is<br>
   silly to even raise as a joke, for it is known <br>
   that erosion is caused by natural forces, so we <br>
   need not introduce any other causes of erosion.<br>
<p>
   The argument that the "face" is not artificial since<br>
   it shows signs of natural erosion is not a logical <br>
   argument, for artificial structures made out of <br>
   natural material will erode just as well as natural<br>
   formations will erode. The "face" has similarity<br>
   to a face. The logical question is, if it was <br>
   an artificial face, how would it appear after<br>
   X years of exposure to natural erosion causing<br>
   forces? Why is it that the intelligent people <br>
   on the ExI list are not asking logical questions,<br>
   but lining up to throw "crap" at these anomalies?<br>
<p>
   I would not give the face a second thought were it not <br>
   for the fact of the sharp liner formations around the <br>
   base of the face and the pyramids in the area, which <br>
   are all in and of themselves anomalous formations.<br>
   There proximity tends to increase their "anomalimity."<br>
<p>
   Why is it wrong to wonder? Why is it wrong to explore <br>
   all the possibilities? Why is it right to throw crap?<br>
   This seems more like group thinking than free inquiry.<br>
