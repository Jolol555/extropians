It seems rather odd that as a child the first thing you learn is <br>
automation, just take a look at child birth.  Sexual intercourse is <br>
sometimes viewed as an automated process (in, out, in, out,...).  <br>
Schooling is a highly automated process.<br>
Being human? Well, that to maybe an automated process 9in some <br>
respects). The human brain--the most automated processor of all time <br>
(does this make a human automated though????)<br>
<p>
no probaly not, as far as I can tell many of us (extropians) are not <br>
as automated as humans as the rest of society, for we have chosen to <br>
be different.  Differance is what brakes automation.  But do not try <br>
to hard to be different just be who you are and you should be viewed <br>
as a better human for doing so.<br>
<p>
So be all the human that you can be and don't fall for gimics or do <br>
what someone tells you, even if they have more "power" than you, you <br>
still have a choice as a human being of the planet earth, and don't <br>
be afraid to make the choice you feel most comfortable with.<br>
