I'm only going to comment on this point. Erik: Recently, the wages of<br>
workers has been rising. However, over the last couple of decades, if you<br>
exclude other forms of income and wealth, the inflation-adjusted incomes of<br>
workers with few skills has indeed been stagnant. Is that the fault of the<br>
market? I would say no. Why?<br>
<p>
Today's economy increasingly rewards those with skills, especially<br>
"symbolic" skills such as computer programming, language skills, legal<br>
expertise, etc. While, in the USA, less skilled workers have made no<br>
progress over a couple of decades, at least they are employed. In European<br>
countries, the very same factors are at work, but the result is high and<br>
persistent unemployment.<br>
<p>
In our case, I would argue that the fault is not the market. Partly it may<br>
be an inevitable result of differences among humans and their abilities and<br>
culturally-influenced preferences (such that some refuse to learn the<br>
necessary skills). But much of it I would say results from a poor<br>
educational system that is weak at motivating students, lacks innovation,<br>
and fails to instill important skills. (I *know* this goes on because I<br>
teach students entering college who almost all lack logical skills, basic<br>
math, and any semblance of scientific education.) Schools in this country<br>
are almost entirely run by the state. The state, not the market. Introduce<br>
market discipline and I predict that things would improve dramatically.<br>
Maybe we'll see: One state has recently begun to use the voucher system,<br>
which is an important step towards a market system.<br>
<p>
So, once again, the market is blamed for the deficiences of statism.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
