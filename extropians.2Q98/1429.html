<i>&gt;That's two different and unrelated questions.  Sure, you have a right</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Different propositon here. If I build a house, I can sell it once. If I hit<br>
a baseball, I can only make each hit once. <br>
<p>
If I develop a unique product, I can sell it many times.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If I create a logo for my enterprise, should someone else be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; permitted to use it to sell their products?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's a trademark, not a copyright or patent; an entirely unrelated</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue.  Using someone else's identity is willful fraud, and I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;no problem with enforcing a tort in that case.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Okay, definition accepted. But use of a copied product as your own is also<br>
fraud for the exact same reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I have no objection to others using my ideas to act as a springboard for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; them to reach even greater heights. I only object to others using my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; creations to deny me a chance to make a living by undercutting me with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; duplicates of what I made.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then don't use business practices that encourage that.  The present</i><br>
<i>&gt;system is based on the assumption of copyright; without it, different</i><br>
<i>&gt;business models would evolve.  This is a good thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
In today's world, I have no choice but to play by the rules of today's game.<br>
Should your utopia become a reality, i will gladly adapt my views to<br>
maximize my comfort level there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Copying, however, is cheating. By your arguments, if I copy your doctoral</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; thesis, I should be able to claim the degree just as if I had done all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; research. After all, it's not 'theft'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, you could publish my thesis, but I presume that a college who</i><br>
<i>&gt;granted degrees to people for using a Xerox machine would not have</i><br>
<i>&gt;a very good reputation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but how do you prevent people from claiming to be the original author<br>
without some law or rule acknowleging the original maker?<br>
