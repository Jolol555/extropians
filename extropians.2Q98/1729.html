<p>
Indeed, but my point is that that agreement puts you in the court of<br>
philosophy NOT science.  In other words, it is a philosophical matter,<br>
and if you must partition truth in philosophical truth, scientific truth, etc.<br>
then this would be a matter of philosophical truth.  Science would be<br>
utterly dependent on a philosophical truth.<br>
<p>
(I think these adjectives are misleading.  Truth is truth.  The adjectives<br>
should merely describe methods of arriving at it, BUT we must be careful<br>
because some methods -- e.g., observation, induction, inference,<br>
scientific experiment -- work or work better than others -- e.g., reading<br>
tea leaves, using a Magic 8 ball.  In this vein, it might be safe to say,<br>
there is no such thing as tea leaf truth or Magic 8 ball truth.  Both of<br>
those methods do not arrive at or validate truth.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As with most of the language, despite what the dictionary says (some times</i><br>

<p>
Okay.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As far as history goes, remember that the winners usuallyy write the</i><br>
<i>&gt;history books, and even if reports from others survive, it's anyone's guess</i><br>
<i>&gt;how accurate they were. Once all the eyewitnesses die off, history gets</i><br>
<i>&gt;muddy past what artifacts actually survive.</i><br>
<p>
I know that history writing is often very biased and that objective methods of<br>
historiography are not usually even sought (but see Fischer's _Historians'<br>
Fallacies_).  Even so, eyewitnesses (biased as they are) often leave behind<br>
lots of evidence.  Eyewitnesses can be very biased because they typically<br>
have more of a stake in how events are recorded and interpreted.  Look at<br>
Thucydides' _The Peloponnesian War_.  Far from sticking to an objective<br>
account, at every turn, he presents his view of why the events happen.<br>
<p>
Losers do write a lot history.  I know you wrote "... winners usuallyy[sic]<br>
write the &gt;history books..." but even this qualification of that cliche does not<br>
go far enough.  We know, e.g., most Japanese history books have a very<br>
slanted account of WW2 -- despite the fact that Japan lost and was<br>
occupied.  Another example: both Afghan Wars in the last century.  While<br>
Afghan versions of this war exist, many British accounts also exist.  A lot of<br>
scholarship is based on the latter.  We should not forget, the losers here --<br>
the British -- not only wrote most of the history, but were by no means a<br>
uniform camp.  They disagree with each other over the import of the war.<br>
<p>
Marxists have, in a sense, lost in history (for now and getting them to admit<br>
it might be very hard), yet their ideology still dominates historical<br>
scholarship.<br>
My point here is that losers don't just write a small amount of history.  They<br>
write a large portion of it.  The Marxist example is important because I bet<br>
Marxists put out more history books than historians of any other ideological<br>
persuasion.<br>
<p>
Also, losers change a lot.  In 1811, Fance might have been considered the<br>
winner in Europe.  5 years later, that judgment would have been seen as a<br>
little off.:)<br>
<p>
Back to objective methods, I think it is still possible to retreive many facts<br>
and objective interpretations of such from them.  That, e.g., we have an<br>
Egyptian tablet and an Hittite tablet telling us of their war (at Kadesh?  My<br>
memory fails me at this hour), even though both accounts claim that their<br>
side won let's us know a war did happen.  Combines with other evidence,<br>
we know neither side was able to wipe out the other -- else no treaty AND<br>
either side's culture would have taken over the other.<br>
<p>
