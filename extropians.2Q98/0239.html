These ketosis diets have been around for a long time.  My wife tells the<br>
story of how her sister tried one when they were teenagers around 1970.<br>
It does work for weight loss (at least temporarily) but the metabolic<br>
state your body is thrown into does not sound healthy.  One side effect my<br>
wife and her family noticed is that it causes very bad, sulphurous body<br>
odor.  With a large family and a small house this was not appreciated.<br>
I don't think having these kind of chemicals floating around in your<br>
body would be good for you.<br>
<p>
The real problem with diets isn't losing weight, it's keeping it off.<br>
I've seen figures suggesting that 90% of dieters regain all the lost<br>
weight within two years.<br>
