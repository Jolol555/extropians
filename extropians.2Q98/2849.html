<i>&gt;For several reasons, starting your own nation would be the best </i><br>
<i>&gt;option if you want real change real quick (before the singularity).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Otherwise, prepare for sometimes decades-long struggles for</i><br>
<i>&gt;usually very modest changes. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
     A lovely idea. The problem becomes one of sovereignty. Any nation <br>
that you are offshore of (even in international waters) will want to <br>
impose it's form of government on you as soon as you build something <br>
worth owning, taxing, etc. And, if you have the conventional weaponry to <br>
defend yourself against such a power, then the power in question's best <br>
interest lies in destroying what you are attempting to create in the <br>
building stages. The only real hope I can see for this type of endeavor <br>
lies in the fact that most governments are extremely ignorant. One 15 <br>
year old with an outmoded commodore and a good brain can do more damage <br>
to civilian and military infrastructure in most countries than an atomic <br>
bomb. Maintaining strict neutrality, and reciprocal trade and travel <br>
agreements probably wouldn't hurt either. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, it's such a shame that all these people are at the brink</i><br>
<i>&gt;of enlightenment, but for some reason don't make the final step.</i><br>
<p>
   I agree. 5% think, 5% think they think, and 90% wouldn't think if you <br>
sat them down and forced them to. If you look at it from a memetical <br>
point of view, the society creates conditions where hypocrisy, laziness, <br>
and stupidity are rewarded, and honesty, diligence, and intelligence are <br>
punished. Fortunately, the empowerment of the information age is <br>
changing this equation. (Just not quickly enough for us <br>
elitist-egalitarians) One of the major shifts I see is from a bias <br>
toward power-over ( Conquistadors, Hierarchal systems) to one of <br>
power-with (Unions, guilds, mentors, free information). When Nanotech <br>
gets here full bore, the lack of scarcity of natural resources should <br>
complete this process, provided the society can be set up to revere <br>
self-actualization instead of control over, and cruelty towards, others. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Transhumanism linked to a practical (based on facts) socio-political</i><br>
<i>&gt;worldview would be unbeatable, the best ideology ever. </i><br>
     <br>
    It's not necessarily Transhumanism (from a technological <br>
standpoint). Its any non-Hierarchal system of thought and belief that <br>
allows a placement of the concept of the "collective good" to be <br>
socialized in an honest, real way will suffice. I know Pagans, and <br>
Wiccans, and Druids, and Taoists, and Buddhists, Confuscists, et. all, <br>
who all feel the same way. It's a matter not of ideology, but of <br>
perception. Given a lack of scarcity of natural resources, it doesn't <br>
even have to be practical. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For example,</i><br>
<i>&gt;wealth and power are extremely important to reach "higher" goals,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or even to simply survive the coming changes, so let's stop treating </i><br>
<i>&gt;them as "dirty" words. The meek shall inherit the earth (if they're</i><br>
<i>&gt;lucky) - the bold everything else.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
    But power and wealth aren't what they used to be. Who has more <br>
power, in an ideological, world-shaping way- Mahatma Gandhi, or Pol Pot? <br>
Who has more money, the team that designed Oak (now Java), or Bill <br>
Gates? Power-with, when correctly applied returns many times over to the <br>
wielder. Power-over is dissipated, since it is a non-cyclical system. To <br>
be bold is good, and wonderful. Use that ability to make others bold.     <br>
