<p>
           <br>
I think a macroscopic assembler is possible but it would not only be less  <br>
efficient than a Nanotechnology based one it would also be harder to make.  <br>
This topic was discussed on the list a year or two ago and I gave 6 reasons <br>
to support my view.<br>
<p>
1) The parts a macroscopic assembler uses would be very expensive, the parts   <br>
   that Nanotechnology uses, atoms, are very cheap.<br>
<p>
2) A macroscopic assembler must use many thousands or millions of different <br>
   types of parts and it must learn how to use all of them. At the most, <br>
   Nanotechnology uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real <br>
   world almost everything we know of is made of only about 20 parts, and for <br>
   life about 10. <br>
<p>
3) All the many different parts a macroscopic assembler must use are fragile, <br>
   and fragile in different ways, the machine must learn the proper handling <br>
   techniques for them all or it will destroy the parts before it can use <br>
   them. There is no way you can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with. <br>
<p>
4) None of the parts in a macroscopic factory are absolutely identical. <br>
   Despite our best efforts, individual variation still exists, and so we <br>
   must deal with each part slightly differently and  compensate for the <br>
   variation in the assembly process if we want the finished product to work <br>
   properly, that often takes intelligence. On the  other hand, according to <br>
   the laws of Physics one hydrogen atom is absolutely identical to another<br>
   hydrogen atom and can be treated in exactly the same way.  Atoms have no <br>
   scratches on them to tell them apart.<br>
<p>
5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital <br>
   domain. You may have to deal with a rod 27 carbon atoms long, or 28 atoms <br>
   long, but you never have to worry about a rod 27.5601334 atoms long.  <br>
   A Macro assembler wouldn't have that luxury when it tried to build <br>
   something with an oak log.<br>
<p>
6) Most of the parts a macroscopic  assembler use would have to be very  <br>
   complex and the ways they interact with other macroscopic parts would be <br>
   even more complex. Think of the windshield of a car, it interacts poorly <br>
   with the engine block, and even with the windshield frame the interaction <br>
   must be managed with great skill or you'll have a disaster. Nanotechnology <br>
   is like building with Lego blocks, you can build structures of arbitrary <br>
   complexity, yet there are only a few different types of blocks and they <br>
   interact with other blocks in only a few different ways. It's easy to <br>
   develop an algorithm to examine any Lego object and then build a duplicate,<br>
   it's very far from easy to find an algorithm that would do the same with a <br>
   car.    <br>
