<p>
Paul, I just re-read your post. I still feel that your post makes the<br>
assumptions I mentioned above. You refer repeatedly to "transhumans"<br>
and "AIs" in the plural, and you seem to describe a scenario in which<br>
both types of entities exist until a synthesis occurs. I'm sorry if<br>
you feel that I was attempting to shred your arguments. I'm not.<br>
Let's see where we agree and where we have different perspectives.<br>
Then, we can focus on the reasons for the difference in perspepective.<br>
<p>
--First difference: I do not feel that I have an ego problem, or an<br>
elitist bully attitude.<br>
--Second differnce: I do not feel that comments referring to other<br>
list members using terms like "ego", "elitist", and "bully" contributes<br>
to the discourse.<br>
<p>
--First major point of agreement: We both appear to believe that the<br>
dichotomy between AI and transhuman will eventually become irrelevant.<br>
<p>
--Third difference: You appear to believe that multiple AIs and transhumans<br>
will appear and then coalesce. I feel that a single SI will appear and<br>
grow by accretion of computing power.<br>
<p>
Shall we continue refining our perspectives regarding this last point?<br>
Alvernatively, if you care to point out other differences, we might<br>
work on those, too.<br>
