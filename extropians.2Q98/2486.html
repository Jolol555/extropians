<i>&gt; In looking for a good home planet for space a exploring species how about a</i><br>

<p>
if its smaller it would have a larger volume???? how is this? Are you listening<br>
to Danny's expanding earth theories again???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and 16 times the mass, but the gravity on the surface of this small</i><br>
<i>&gt; world would be exactly the same as we have, 1g. The good part is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; escape velocity would only be 1/16 that of the Earth. The horizon would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; little close but otherwise things would seem perfectly earth-like on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; surface, however you could put a billet into orbit with a hand gun, and with</i><br>
<i>&gt; a rifle you could hit the moon.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The bad part is that the ability to keep an atmosphere depends on the escape</i><br>
<i>&gt; velocity not the surface gravity, so such a planet wouldn't be able to retain</i><br>
<i>&gt; one for a very long time, at least not from a geological point of view.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, such a location would be ideal for an exploring species to settle, and it<br>
would be small enough for reasonable tech to maintain an atmosphere fairly easily<br>
for however many thousands of years it is occupied, and make sky hooks feasible.<br>
However, speaking about planets a species would develop on, I think that a Mars<br>
sized planet in an Earth regional orbit would probably work better.<br>
