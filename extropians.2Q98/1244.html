I have been lurking on the list for some time, trying to resist the urge to<br>
answer to some posts. I am a molecular biologist and when I am not cutting<br>
DNA to pieces and trying not to get killed by accidentally developing a<br>
biological weapon, I sometimes find time to think about matters divine. <br>
<p>
And as meeting an alien civilization can be a bit regretted, so I regret<br>
making a net search on several ideas Ive been thinking about and finding<br>
out that theres an awful lot of people thinking roughly along the same<br>
lines out there...<br>
<p>
(I slowly readjust to the idea that it may be some fun after all to be one<br>
of gods instead of the GOD)<br>
<p>
:-)))<br>
<p>
Oh well, its always like that, darn it, whenever I have a Nobel prize idea<br>
and do a Medline search, I always find somebody already published that. As<br>
a Polish saying goes, Hope is mother of fools. I dont mind being a fool<br>
though.<br>
<p>
Anyway, recently I have been thinking about few things and since nobody<br>
came up with those in the past week's posts, let me give one a shot. Maybe<br>
you guys discussed them twelve times before, so I can save myself some<br>
effort - since laziness is the highest human virtue.<br>
<p>
Once we start to understand how the mind/brain works and start to make it<br>
work better how do we stop weirdos/terrorist from developing next<br>
incarnations of computer viruses? The fact that there are teenagers who<br>
play at those now is a real blessing, as far as I understand it, 'cause it<br>
allowed for development of the immunity system so terrorist couldnt take<br>
the lead, and I think they would never be able to pose real threat here.<br>
However, I dont know if we can always be so lucky. Many species died<br>
because of a too good pathogen, and many civilizations perished (or did not<br>
develop, which is about the same) because of stupid ideology. And if<br>
somobody would care to hire me for a few million bucks (most of which would<br>
go into equipment and a nice building very deep underground), I dont think<br>
it would be very difficult to develop a biological weapon which would be<br>
very efficient indeed :-)) <br>
<p>
I dont like the idea of leaking my mind out of its carbon form (not that it<br>
is safe here) and then getting infected and becoming "mad". Backup is a<br>
solution that comes first to mind, but if the 'virus' is good enough, its<br>
not much help.<br>
<p>
OK, hope it isnt too naive and I did not contribute to the unspecific<br>
afferent of the discussion. There were a few moans about the s/n ratio<br>
recently, and Id like to somewhat defensively point out that "unspecific"<br>
stimulation of the reticular formation is quite important for the working<br>
of the human brain :-)<br>
<p>
best,<br>
b<br>
