we will all likely agree that extropian memes spread and mutate<br>
much more readily among the young, which interests me in the<br>
concepts to be found in childrens literature.<br>
<p>
there was a cartoon in about the late 60s-early 70s (tho my childhood<br>
memories are dim) about a talking dog and four teenagers who went<br>
about solving crimes and such:  scooby doo.   recently it occurred<br>
to me that the dog and the dumb guy were superstitious, whereas the<br>
smart ones solved the mysteries using logic and reason.  there was always a<br>
natural<br>
logical explanation to everything in the end, whereas the bad guys were always<br>
trying to scare them away using techniques that were effective only on<br>
the superstitious non-logical players.<br>
<p>
there was another show called johnny quest, where johnny and his<br>
scientist father and companions go about saving the world, again<br>
thru technological means.  they would always overcome techno-evildoers<br>
by producing a still more sophisticated technological solution.<br>
<p>
i salute the creators of these childrens shows.  perhaps it was<br>
partially thru their influence that my thinking is extropian today,<br>
this philosphy being a natural extention of the anti-superstitious<br>
techno-can-do-ism of scooby doo and johnny quest.<br>
<p>
(sorry max more, i suspect both of these shows were before your time... {8^D<br>
spike)<br>
