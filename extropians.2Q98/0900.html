<p>
Getting off the track of this theme, I am interested in the concept of 'free<br>
market'. <br>
<p>
Today, of course, it does not exist due to government rules and corporations<br>
who control production and much technology. But, will this status quo<br>
continue in the future?<br>
<p>
I conceive of a world without corporate entities, in fact, where these<br>
creatures could not survive. The key to this revolution will be the<br>
universal availability of self-contained manufacturing systems that can be<br>
self-replicating and can use the raw materials present in the local<br>
environment to create anything the operator desires, in whatever quantity.<br>
The only limit would be power input, and here I must postulate easy access<br>
to cheap energy from an as yet undiscovered source. Okay, so it's science<br>
fiction right now, but...<br>
<p>
Commerce would be by trading, buying, and selling the templates for<br>
controlling the manufacturing machines. Any individual could publish these<br>
templates. Again, there needs to be a universally availible communication<br>
net. Advances in RF technology could make such a net possible without any<br>
'infrastructure' other than the terminals themselves, if only they were<br>
sufficiently many.<br>
<p>
If everyone can instantly communicate and trade templates, there would be no<br>
market for transportation as we know it, and large factories would become<br>
obsolete.<br>
<p>
I see huge resistance to the start of this system from existing corporations<br>
and governments, but once the first 'replicators' were built, their<br>
dissemination to the world would be inevitable..<br>
<p>
Comments?<br>
