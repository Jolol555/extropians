<i>&gt;Interesting to note that there were no numbers for atheists and agnostics.</i><br>
<p>
Well, they don't have a church and they are no religion, so it's very hard<br>
to give numbers. Even estimations seem terribly difficult to do, as I, for<br>
example, was an atheist since the age of 13 but have only left church at<br>
16 -- many atheists may still be member of one or the other church.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And don't forget the agnostics, who either say "we don't know" or "we</i><br>
<i>&gt;*cannot* know" when questioned about the supernaturals.</i><br>
<p>
The problem is that if you don't have any information about something, it<br>
does not exist. We don't have any information about supernaturals -- all<br>
speculation is irrelevant &amp; leads to nothing.<br>
<p>
