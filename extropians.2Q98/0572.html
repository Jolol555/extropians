Wow, this conversation could really open up a large can of post-human worms, but<br>
suffice it to say that (here comes the old somewhat naturally evolved human<br>
speaking) a balance of rational and irrational creativity is likely responsible<br>
for some of the more clever insights into the human world. Whenever you put a<br>
limitation on perception you block possible avenues of thought which might lead<br>
to revelation.<br>
<p>
Lets think about this however. In say a post human model, presumably derived from<br>
a nano-equiped neural/body scanning system, you could build integrate a full<br>
electro-chemical simulation. The reason would be to give the new entity an<br>
consistent temporal relationship to say the 'human' who'd interface with it.<br>
Think about what would happen if you removed the electrochemical portion of our<br>
mechanism. We might experience 1000 years of human time per second, or something<br>
along those lines. This could make communication with this entity really<br>
difficult. Would the model of the human mind go 'insane' because its software is<br>
not capable of operating with these limitations removed. (i.e. could an<br>
automobile operate at the speed of light with out disintegrating?) I think our<br>
'physical model' which supports the human consciousness, would need to have built<br>
into it a way of controlling the speed of electrochemical simulation. This could<br>
be controlled by the posthuman, which would allow its software to re-write itself<br>
as necessary to accommodate the new efficiency. (what a rant no?)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps this is the upside of the posthuman.  Whether or not we hit a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Singularity, we will hit a Creativity Augmentum where creativity will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; much in demand at a period when we have not only the time, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain-power to create.  The leaps in our creativity will be manifold.  Will</i><br>
<i>&gt; it be rational?  If we are rational beings, our creativity is rational.</i><br>
<p>
Do you think that Van Gough was a 'rationally creative' mind?<br>
<p>
<p>
Here's a quote which I love:<br>
<p>
"Method helps intuition when it is not transformed into dictatorship. Intuition<br>
augments method if it does not instill anarchy. In every moment of our semiotic<br>
existence, method and intuition complement one another."<br>
<p>
Mihai Nadin<br>
Interface Design and Evaluation - Semiotic Implications<br>
<p>
<p>
Perhaps I'm wrong seeing METHOD as the rational side of creativity. To me it does<br>
seem that intuition is rarely based on a RATIONAL line of thinking.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Finally this list is getting back into the singularity. Which by the way, is an<br>
important element in an installation I'm working on for the ICC Modern Art Museum<br>
in Tokyo. MAX and NATASHA would probably love what we're working on. (-;<br>
