In order to get from 1 to 3 you must pass through 2.  People will not have<br>
access to nanotechnology if they have already died of starvation from the<br>
automation leading right up to nanotech.  If what your saying is only the<br>
elite of the elite will survive to become transhumans then I could give a shit<br>
about any transhuman economy, thank you very much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The best humanity can hope for is that transhumanity is altruistic,</i><br>

<p>
?That would be ideal.  But 'altruism' is one particular value than has been<br>
given a bad rap by several on this list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Very rapid increases in productivity caused by</i><br>

<i>&gt; so, the rich may not be in much better shape than the poor: Your money</i><br>

<i>&gt; will be transhuman, so there is no way that a simple human such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself can judge whether this will make you happy.</i><br>
<p>
This is all very true, but it dodges the question of how the majority of<br>
people will survive just getting to that nanotech transhuman phase.  It's the<br>
sophisticated automation leading up to nanotech that first poses a problem.<br>
Again, you can't get from 1 to 3 without passing through 2.  2 is what I've<br>
been talking about.  How do you survive the *transition*?<br>
