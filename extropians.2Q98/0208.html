If there is "new land" you can move away legal or just illegal.<br>

<p>
Yes, thats true in our time. But there are people in this world who work  <br>
to make this split legal....<br>
<p>
Think a little about your American history and "the West" and the  <br>
diffrents between the settlements on the "new land".... And be avare about  <br>
the fact that this splitting of communities was an acepted rule in indian  <br>
societies for several hundred years.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Once the direct delegation democracy have made a decision, it havn't to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;force its operations on the minority who disapprove. The decision represen-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ted a consensus/compromise among direct delegates (no consensus = no deci-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sion). Each delegate had forwarded only the orginaly words of a group of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And if my delegate misrepresents me?  See above.</i><br>
<p>
Than all decisions are illegal because the groups have to acept voluntary  <br>
the decisions of all delegates. If one or more groups cannot acepted the  <br>
consensus among their delegates because one or more delegates have misre- <br>
presented their group(s) than the delegates have to meet again to come to  <br>
another consensus.<br>
<p>
Anarcho-Syndicalist Unions like the CNT, the SAC and FAU work with this  <br>
democratic principle(s).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Once the direct consensus democracy have made a decision, it havn't to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;force its operations on the minority who disapprove because if there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;disapproving minority than there isn't a consensus among all members and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;therefore no decision.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree completely.  Now, imagine direct consensus democracy happening on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; very small scale, even between just two people at a time, all over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; country.</i><br>
<p>
You speak about the USA, isn't it? I'm working here in Europe in a federa- <br>
tion of anarchistic groups of all kinds of anarchistic trends and we  <br>
making decisions with the consensus principle since 10 years. And I'm  <br>
working on a-infos internet project too making most decisions with the  <br>
consensus principle too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Plus, since both participants agree on the "vote" beforehand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they will almost never need to be forced to agree with themselves (except</i><br>
<i>&gt; when they change their minds after voting).  Now imagine people calling</i><br>
<i>&gt; these votes "contracts" and calling this system "the free market."</i><br>
<p>
Okay, but I think there is a diffrent between a contract and a consensus  <br>
decision. A consensus decision ends if the participant in this consensus  <br>
cannot longer agree with this consensus. But a contract is a peace of pa- <br>
per who can force you to agree with yourself and your old decision if you  <br>
have mutual agreed in a time sequence where you are obligated by the  <br>
contract.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Have you ever notices the "military" decision making procedures inside the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;industrial companies? --</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So they are competetive.  Fortunately, in the case of companies, they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; competing to see who can perform the services which are worth the most to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the most people... note that each and every buyer co-operates voluntarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; when they buy goods, and that the company which performs services which are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not worth enough to enough buyers eventually goes out of business.</i><br>
<p>
I see, you havn't had thought about it. I havn't told from competetion. I  <br>
have asked if you noticed the inner structure of industrial companies to  <br>
make decisions and not their relationship to buyers/customers.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The military, on the other hand, competes in the arena of force.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires no one's consent, and in no way competes in a way that maximizes</i><br>
<i>&gt; co-operation.  The essential differences between these organizations,</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore, is vast, even if they are both competing.</i><br>
<p>
See above. Therefore this statement is wrong. Workers and their managment  <br>
inside the industrial world are forced to co-operate: the managment have  <br>
to co-operate with their workers because they cannot produce without wor-  <br>
kers and the workers have to co-operate with the managment, because they  <br>
need their wages to survive and therefore they have to acept that the ma-  <br>
nagment have command of their work.<br>
<p>
The structure of the military is as well hirarchically as the structure of  <br>
the industry. Both have structures where competence and responsibility are  <br>
split from the top to the bottom; the people on the top make the decisions  <br>
and have a high responsibillity whereas the people at the bottom carry out  <br>
orders with a low responsibillity; only the managment -- the industrial ge- <br>
neral staff -- could change the production and the structure of the firm  <br>
and have command of this structure of working.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Once the managment have made a decision, it have to force its operations</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on the majority of workers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is completely wrong.  Under capitalism, corporations can't (legally)</i><br>
<i>&gt; force their employees to do anything.  All of the employees volunteer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; work in a corporation.  All those who don't volunteer to do what the CEO</i><br>
<i>&gt; wants don't have to work there at all.  How is this force?</i><br>
<p>
Because workers and human beings like Bill Gates or Rockefeller are *not*  <br>
on the same level. Rich people have enough money to build up a firm; there- <br>
fore for them are to work for wage or to work for their own firms a real  <br>
alternativ; but if you have to work for wage and must spend most of your  <br>
wage for your survive you are not able to earn enough money to build up  <br>
your own firm. Therefore you are forces to earn wage your hole life.<br>
<p>
Every costs of interests of all firms who produce, transport or sell a  <br>
product are part of the price of this product. Every buyer of a product  <br>
have to pay the price -- and all costs of interests inside. Rich people  <br>
could invest there money and could earn this costs of interests back which  <br>
they have to pay inside the prices -- or they earn more. But poor people  <br>
who cann't invest their money because they need this money to survive can-  <br>
not earn cost of interests back. Therefore they are not on the same level  <br>
with the firm- and capital-owners. And therefore they cannot co-operate  <br>
voluntary on the same level.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Therefore capitalism in its dayly reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;isn't much closer to "spontaneous order" than democracy.</i><br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Nico<br>
