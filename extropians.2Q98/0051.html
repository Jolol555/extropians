Colombia Rebels Wheel Out Secret Weapon In War: Home-Made Tanks<br>
<p>
By Karl Penhaul, Reuters<br>
<p>
     BOGOTA (April 1, 1998 Reuters) - Colombia's leftist rebels<br>
wheeled out a surprise weapon this week in their long-running war<br>
with the government -- home-made "tanks" built from farm<br>
tractors.<br>
     Two of the makeshift war-horses, farm tractors with the<br>
driver's cabs protected by thick sheets of steel and M-60<br>
machine-guns mounted on top, spearheaded a guerrilla attack on<br>
the town of Vista Hermosa in eastern Meta province on Tuesday.<br>
     The rebels have sporadically used crude armored vehicles in<br>
the past. But police sources said on Wednesday the growing<br>
sophistication of the designs indicated they were trying to form<br>
their own "armored cavalry division".<br>
     "(These tanks) were made using a small tractor which was<br>
stripped down to the chassis and fitted with extra thick, special<br>
tires," Vista Hermosa town council official Alirio Omana told<br>
Reuters.<br>
     "It was a sophisticated machine and could have destroyed an<br>
entire army," he said, adding that the "tanks" drove through the<br>
town at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph).<br>
     In Tuesday's attack, about 300 Revolutionary Armed Forces of<br>
Colombia (FARC) rebels destroyed the town's bank and abandoned<br>
one of the tanks after crashing it into the police station. One<br>
policeman and four rebels died in the firefight.<br>
     "With these tanks the guerrillas are looking to restrict<br>
their casualties," Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations director of<br>
the national police force, told Reuters.<br>
     The first reports that the FARC was building its own<br>
military vehicles came when the army discovered two dump trucks<br>
reinforced with steel sheeting in northern Bolivar province in<br>
1995.<br>
     Regional army commander Gen. Freddy Padilla, head of the<br>
army's 7th Division, said the FARC used another tractor-based<br>
"tank" in a raid elsewhere in Meta earlier this month but<br>
downplayed the weapon's effectiveness.<br>
     "These tanks do not really give the bandits any advantage.<br>
They're easy to neutralize and destroy," he said.<br>
     However, the increasing military might of the FARC and the<br>
smaller National Liberation Army (ELN) is causing an ever-bigger<br>
headache for Colombia's armed forces.<br>
     At a congressional inquiry into military strategy on Tuesday<br>
evening, armed forces chief Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett put the<br>
number of guerrillas in the country at some 20,000 -- 33 percent<br>
higher than any previous official estimate.<br>
     He said the army had an active combat force of just 40,000<br>
men to fight the rebel threat.<br>
     Those figures, coupled with the guerrillas' growing ability<br>
to outmaneuver even the army's best-trained counterinsurgency<br>
troops in the mountains and jungles of Colombia has led to sharp<br>
criticism from U.S. military experts.<br>
     In comments on Tuesday, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, head of the<br>
Miami-based U.S. Southern Command, said Colombia's military was<br>
incapable of defeating the country's drug traffickers and rebel<br>
armies.<br>
