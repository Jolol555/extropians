The Princeton Engineeering Anomalies Research corpus of data does exactly<br>
this, by brute force during 20 years of dogged work with stable protocols<br>
and many Ss.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, phenomena with small effect size frequent *don't* yield<br>
significant results in modest experiments, and cannot be expected to - a<br>
point that seems to elude non-statisticians.  Prof. Jessica Utts is good on<br>
this.<br>

<p>
It's not altogether clear that this is the case.  Take a look at the<br>
reports in Radin's book on `presentiment', where they found electrodermal<br>
orienting responses immediately in advance of Ss. seeing shocking or<br>
distressing or erotically arousing images, but not with control neutral<br>
imagery.  This experimental set-up is said to have been replicated<br>
succesfully, and is easy enough to do.<br>
<p>
And of course the same generic objection could be made against non-local<br>
quantum effects.  The difference is that QT has powerful theory predicting<br>
the observed effects; parapsychology or anomalies research has only the<br>
offensive data and a batch of rough-and-ready explanatory schemata.  But<br>
the data need to be explained, and at this stage of the game fraud and<br>
sloppy thinking are not good enough explanations.<br>
