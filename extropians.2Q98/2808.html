In a message dated 98-06-27 12:31:52 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; you are in fact being constantly<br>
<i>  &gt; tracked by a large and pervasive computer system under the control of a</i><br>
<i>  &gt; large and pervasive organization. So what? &gt;&gt;</i><br>
So what?... You can't possibly be serious, and if you are, don't count on my<br>
vote if you ever run for office.  I don't mean for this to sound snotty, Dan,<br>
but think about what you just wrote.   I don't go around commiting crimes left<br>
and right, but that doesn't mean I want some officious snot of a beaurocrat<br>
poking his/her/its nose into where I go or what I buy or who I speak to<br>
anytime they happen to have an urge.<br>
<p>
And the sad fact is that both individuals and gov'ts have demonstrated that if<br>
they are given the ability to snoop and use info for private gain, they will<br>
do so.<br>
