<p>
I think we disagree as to what atomism signifies.  Atomism is making a<br>
statement about the actual values on the identity diagram, rather than<br>
about their sum.  For example, on your site you give two objects, A and B,<br>
where B is one greater than A.  If I add 0 to this mix, we get the<br>
following identity matrix:<br>
<p>
    0   A   B<br>
0   0  +1  +2<br>
A  -1   0  +1<br>
B  -2  -1   0<br>
<p>
When atomism states that A can change independently of B, it means that it<br>
changes relative to 0, and that this does not affect B relative to 0.  For<br>
example, if A increases by three relative to 0, we get the new chart:<br>
<p>
    0   A   B<br>
0   0  +4  +2<br>
A  -4   0  -2<br>
B  -2  +2   0<br>
<p>
That this change is possible is trivially true; that it is compatible with<br>
atomism is also true.  Not even atomism claims that something can change<br>
relative to itself, but rather that it changes relative to 0.  Note that<br>
this does not affect B relative to 0 (+2), or 0 relative to B (-2), which<br>
was all that atomism was trying to prove anyway. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: If identity is difference, then A = 0 and -A = 0,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   where each are differentiated from themselves, which </i><br>
<i>&gt;   is to say that the difference between A and A = 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   If identity is difference, then A is A only by differ-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   entaiton from -A. Lo and behold, the sum of that rela-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tion also = 0. We cannot segment that relation into </i><br>
<i>&gt;   two separate parts without each becoming 0, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;   yet together they are also 0... in sum.</i><br>
<p>
Wait.  Stop there.  What I'm trying to say is that under the mystical<br>
experience, the difference between 0 and 1 is zero, NOT that the sum of<br>
the difference between 0 and 1 and the difference between 1 and 0 is zero. <br>
The latter is trivial; the former is mystical.<br>
<p>
A mysticist's identity chart would look like this:<br>
<p>
   0  1<br>
0  0  0<br>
1  0  0<br>
<p>
or, since 0 = 1,<br>
<p>
   0  1<br>
0  1  1<br>
1  1  1<br>
<p>
or even<br>
<p>
   0  1<br>
0  1  1<br>
1  0  0<br>
<p>
That your other identity charts do NOT look like this indicates strongly<br>
to me that the difference between 1 and 0 is 1, and that the difference<br>
between 0 and 1 is -1.  Though these SUM to 0, my mystical identity charts<br>
differ from your identity charts in a non-trivial way.  I assert that MY<br>
identity chart is mystical, whereas yours is not.  :) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The showing of "all such values actually being </i><br>
<i>&gt;   zero" is the fact that "self to self = 0," that</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is, that the difference/identity of A to A = 0,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   which holds for every thing. Each thing gets a </i><br>
<i>&gt;   non-zero identity only by giving the opposite</i><br>
<i>&gt;   non-zero to another thing (or empty space) and </i><br>
<i>&gt;   the sum of that relation is the same as the self</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to self relation. So there is never not-zero.</i><br>
<p>
I should have been more specific; I mean that you must show that 1 is 0<br>
relative to 0 in order to demonstrate mysticism, as per the identity<br>
charts I drew earlier; anything less is simply the regular old physics we<br>
know and love. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Zero may also be defined as "symmetry."</i><br>
<i>&gt;   If there is asymmetry, it is what it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;   relative to symmetry, and that's symmetry!</i><br>
<i>&gt;   So there can never be not-symmetry in all.</i><br>
<p>
Er, *I* don't define 0 as symmetry, and I don't think it's valid to do so.<br>
Sure, symmetrical things will sum to zero in the way you describe, but you<br>
commit a fallacy of parts to say that just because two numbers sum to a<br>
value that both are that value.  This is like saying that since 1 + 2 = 3,<br>
1 = 3 and 2 = 3.  Clearly this is not true; but in the same way, if 1 + -1<br>
= 0, you cannot say that 1 = 0.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: I think that your saying that if holism always</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is, such that there is no not-holism, this is atomism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   i.e., there is H and H is H free from not-H.</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary, I am simply saying that H = A, a conclusion which you<br>
disagreed with earlier but which I assert.<br>
