Considering the interest that this thread has generated, why don't we get a<br>
late summer  reading club/discussion group going on the topic ?   Perhaps we<br>
could all throw around some suggested readings on the theme of "Self, Others &amp;<br>
The Politics of Immortality", and once we can reach an agreement slate one<br>
week for the discussion of each book...  anybody up for it ???   I'll take it<br>
upon myself to jot down the names of all proposed materials, then post the<br>
list, and we could vote a pre-determined number of selections in or out.   The<br>
reading order would be chronologically.    Perhaps everybody could select 1<br>
"classical" selection and one "contemporary".    Anybody up for it ?     <br>
