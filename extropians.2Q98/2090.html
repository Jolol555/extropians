No the software is set only to detect write attempts to the hard drive. Sticking this<br>
floppy in the slot is all it takes for this virus to make a write attempt to the boot<br>
sector of the hard drive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The virus does not need to run for the virus protection software to detect</i><br>

<i>&gt; hard drive you don't need, stick the disk in the floppy, take it out, and</i><br>

<i>&gt; not.</i><br>
<p>
It does. Believe me, I was rather intrigued about this, and I and my sister (who was<br>
sys admin at Sturm Ruger and is now sys admin at a local hospital) ran a series of<br>
tests on this point, trying to see what the minimum effort was to get this virus to<br>
make an attack. I just wish I had some means of getting this virus in a state where I<br>
could take a look at the code.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; i think that the stealth virus you've got is a boot sector virus, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; AFAIK, not all stealth virii are, by definition, boot sector virii.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, the main reason I thought that it was was because it made a write attempt to the<br>
boot sector of my hard drive, and the antivirus software database said that virii of<br>
the Stealth C family are boot sector virii.<br>
