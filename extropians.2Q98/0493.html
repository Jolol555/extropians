<i>&gt; if so...under what circumstances?</i><br>
<p>
I seem to recall some old discussions about &gt;pets and uplifting, but<br>
not much about their contents (I'm definitely going to write myself a<br>
remembrance agent for list archives one day!). There is also an essay<br>
by John de Rivaz about the future of companion animals at<br>
<a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Society/companion.txt">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Society/companion.txt</a><br>
<p>
Why do we have pets? I think it is because we want companionship, but<br>
not necessarily with the demands of other humans and quite often<br>
because we enjoy companionship with a *different* kind of being. <br>
<p>
So I wouldn't be surprised if we in the future keep semi- or fully<br>
intelligent pets. They might have rights on their own; we already give<br>
animal rights, and one could imagine a canine union acting as the<br>
lobby for intelligent dogs (demands for fair treatment, the right to<br>
have an owner or similar stuff). A cat union will of course never<br>
happen :-). These pets do not need to be just animals or improved<br>
animals, they might be AIs or biotechnological constructs. In some<br>
sense a family already includes not just the humans, but the pets and<br>
plants. In the future the relationship may become more like a kind of<br>
group marriage/cohabitation contract where different beings agree on<br>
forming a social unit of some kind.<br>
<p>
Overall, I think uplifting of other species is a good idea, but the<br>
ethics is quite complicated.<br>
