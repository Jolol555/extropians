<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; From some public statements made by atheists around here, I would &gt; &gt;&gt; be tempted to define atheism as a fervent belief in the NON &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;existence of a supreme being...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Indeed, atheism is (often) more than just saying "it's extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unlikely that god exists", but also "it is not _desirable_ that god</i><br>
<i>&gt; exists". It's about understanding that, certainly for a transhumanist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the existence of god is _not_ "neutral", but very, VERY bad. All our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;efforts would be futile. After all, don't we want to become gods</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ourselves? No such luck if the job has already been </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;taken...(remember: if god existed he would _not_ be "nice", just look &gt; &gt;at this deathist planet and universe. Being omnipotent = being </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;responsible for all that happens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is one of the views I have held for quite a long time. The &gt; Christian Old Testament god is a particularly nasty critter..if this &gt; is the way things actually run, I will be quite happy to take my &gt; rightful place in Hell.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, it's a sadistic psychopath by anyone's standards...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; However, I don't think the universe is 'deathist'. Life is just &gt; localized reversal of entropy. As such, it appears the universe is out &gt; to get us...Actually, for the universe to be 'deathist' would &gt; presuppose some sort of controlling organization that cared one way or &gt; the other, would it not?</i><br>
<p>
Or a god...That was the point: if you assume that the Judeo-Christian<br>
God is real, than you also must assume that he doesn't give a crap about<br>
the well-being of his creatures. Fortunately the chances that the bible<br>
even remotely approximates the truth (where the supernatural is<br>
concerned) are very slim, and it's much more likely that all is just a<br>
big ol' coincidence. That would explain a lot. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I shall continue as a quite vocal agnostic until I find sufficient &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence to change..</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And I shall continue as a quite vocal atheist until someone can &gt; &gt;present sufficient evidence of god's existence and/or that this would &gt; &gt;not be a disaster for humanity and transhumanists in particular.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If there are gods or a God, I have a hard time seeing any reason why &gt; this being would have any particular interest in the goings-on of &gt; Terrans or any other lifeform, except as far as these beings could &gt; evolve to a level capable of providing stimulating conversation or &gt; competition...</i><br>
<p>
This being would _by definition_ be a ruthless sadist, because it is<br>
supposed to be absolutely 100% omnipotent. It could have made things<br>
infinitely better for us but it didn't. It wants mindless worship from<br>
creatures it has equipped with intelligence and "free will" (what is<br>
free will if God knows everything in advance). What kind of being would<br>
torture people forever in hell for the slightest transgression? People<br>
it has programmed *itself* to commit those transgressions. It's like<br>
making a creature that's always thirsty, and punishing it when it tries<br>
to drink. The Judeo-Christian God does NOT value stimulating<br>
conversation -- he only wants blind worship. Competition? I don't think<br>
so! When Satan and Adam &amp; Eve got too "emancipated" they got kicked out<br>
of heaven with a death sentence slapped to their ass...<br>
<p>
That's why we should be glad that He is just a myth. <br>
<p>
Strong atheism should definitely be a part of the transhuman package,<br>
certainly if you want to teach the philosophy to novices, because<br>
otherwise they would be easy prey for any religious fanatic. "If you<br>
don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything". God (and the rest<br>
of the "supernatural") does not exist until he comes down from the<br>
heavens in all his glory etc. People really need to get rid of that<br>
"there must be some higher force"-meme in order to make truly rational<br>
decisions (about cryonics, for example). The god-meme is very powerful,<br>
in order to beat it one has to have a powerful counter-meme, not the<br>
maybe/maybe not agnostic approach. People are going to get infected<br>
with memes (programmed/brainwashed etc.) one way or another, that's<br>
how we work, so better make it the transhuman/atheist/rationalist meme.<br>
<p>
Oh dear, I have been preaching again...:-)<br>
