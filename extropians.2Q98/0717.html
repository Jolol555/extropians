Fact check: the Old Testament god is Judaic, not Christian, and Hell is not an<br>
Old Testament concept.  <br>
<p>
An interesting afterlife is not a Judaic concept, unless you go to the<br>
mystics.  However nasty the behavior of Jehovah he at least inflicted his idea<br>
of justice in the real world.  Adam and Eve weren't sent to hell when they<br>
died, but sentenced to labor and death in this world (along with their<br>
children.)  The snake got to crawl.  When the Jews ticked off God he went<br>
ahead and killed them, or let them be enslaved.  When he was happy he let them<br>
genocide the natives.<br>
<p>
The Jews did have 'sheol', which as far as I know was similar to the default<br>
Greek afterlife.  Real dull.  "We have a soul, but there's not much point to<br>
it."<br>
<p>
At any rate, I share Max's view.  I am not a theist, therefore 'a-theist' is<br>
a perfectly appropriate label.<br>
