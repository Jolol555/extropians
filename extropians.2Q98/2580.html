<p>
<p>

       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Dan, in the difference between -1 <br>
   and 0 there IS a POSITIVE, just observe: <br>
<p>
   0 - (-1) = 1<br>
<p>
   0 minus -1 = difference of POSITIVE 1. The <br>
   difference is also negative: -1 - 0 = -1, <br>
   and the net difference is 1 + (-1) = 0.<br>
<p>
   It is just as valid for A to say, "B shrunk<br>
   (-) in size relative to me," as it is for A <br>
   to say, "I grew (+) in size relative to B," <br>
   in fact, they are the same statements!<br>
<p>
   FACT: (+) and (-) are *equally* indicated!<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: That's half, here are all measurments:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   After B passed by A near the speed of light,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   A filled out this chart of all differences:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;              A  B</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;             ______</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;          A | 0 -1 |</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;            |      |</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;          B | 1  0 |</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;            --------</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Funny how this chart is different from the others you've provided before,</i><br>
<i>&gt;yet you claim to be repeating yourself.  &lt;sigh&gt; I guess that's to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;expected. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Get serious, each diagram is defined. <br>
   The matrix you presented sums half of all <br>
   measurements from BOTH observers. The matrix<br>
   above, as stated, are derived only from A.<br>
<p>
   It is just as valid for A to say, "B shrunk<br>
   in size relative to me," as it is for A to <br>
   say, "I grew in size relative to B," in <br>
   fact, they are the same statements!<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   (AA) Difference between A and A = 0</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   (AB) Difference between A and B = A is  1 larger</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   (BA) Difference between B and A = B is -1 smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   (BB) Difference between B and B = 0</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unless you're defining relativity differently from the way I am (which</i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't surprise me one bit), you can't have A find AB, and CERTAINLY not</i><br>
<i>&gt;BB.  </i><br>
<p>
  IAN: If we can measure the difference between <br>
  the thing we are in relative to the thing we <br>
  are in (=0), we can measure anything we see <br>
  relative to that same thing, and use it as<br>
  a zero point of departure for measure. So<br>
  claiming "A can't measure (B,B)" is baseless.<br>
<p>
  The fact that measurement is relative means<br>
  simply that where we place our zero point <br>
  of measure IS RELATIVE, is ARBITRARY. There<br>
  is no rule that says you cannot assume that <br>
  you are in motion (non zero) even though your <br>
  at rest (0) with respect to your self. Your <br>
  argument seeks to prohibit valid measurements.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;AB is not a measurement which A can make: it can only make BA and</i><br>
<i>&gt;infer that AB must be its negative.  Similarly, it could infer that BB</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be 0, but no measurement which A can make will show this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How can I say this?  Well, think about how A is making a measurement: it</i><br>
<i>&gt;takes itself, which is zero, and it compares itself against others.  A can</i><br>
<i>&gt;observe these differences.  But could A measure A from B's perspective</i><br>
<i>&gt;this way?  No.  Indeed, if A tried to use B's actual perspective, you'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;get my non-zero chart.  Instead, A must infer that if A perceives B to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;smaller and A to be larger, B must perceive the same thing.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt;inference is valid in Newtonian mechanics, but as we can see in this case</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is not: B has a different bottom row than A would infer.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Dan, listen to me: I'm NOT saying that<br>
  A is measuring himself from B's perspective<br>
  when I say that "(AB) difference = larger." A <br>
  is measuring the relative size of two entities<br>
  before him. 1 is larger (Hello!) than the other.<br>
  A does NOT have to see A from B's perspective<br>
  to accurately observer that "I am larger."<br>
<p>
  Observe the equality of these statements:<br>
<p>
"You're smaller(-) than me" = "I am larger(+) than you."<br>
<p>
"You're smaller(-) than me" = "I am larger(+) than you."<br>
<p>
 There is no reference frame shifting involved<br>
 in my analysis. That's what you are missing in <br>
 what I'm saying. A can make BOTH of the statements <br>
 above, and the larger statement defines the positive<br>
 that you've been arguing is not valid, but clearly is.<br>
