Paul Hughs wrote with a quote from Damien:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Artists like me will do what we can to shape our understanding of the</i><br>
changing<br>
<i>&gt;realities about us, to catch its frenzy on the ends of our nervy tendrils.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But poets are no longer the unacknowledged legislators of mankind, if they</i><br>
ever<br>
<i>&gt;were. No, that role has passed to those who dwell in what C. P. Snow so long</i><br>
<i>&gt;ago called the Second Culture."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What of the Third Culture - the cross-pollination of the two?  If wasn't for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the vision of 'poets' such as yourself and other sci-fi authors, many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;pioneers in modern science would not have pursued their chosen careers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wouldn't you say that poetry, art and literature helps provide a context, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;navigation map, a passion, a *direction* in which to steer this rocketship we</i><br>
<i>&gt;call technology?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hopefully Natasha is reading this and can add her own input on the importance</i><br>
<i>&gt;of art in an extropian future.</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't mentioned in Damien's book, and I don't know if my work was<br>
relevant to the content/subject of his book or not, but I would hasten to<br>
think that my work in the area of art and science is highly relevant<br>
interest to a "Third Culture." <br>
<p>
C.P. Snow was a major influence on my thinking.  When I first realized that<br>
art and science had something in common, I began to meet more scientists<br>
with an openness - a willingness to understand the cognitive processes in<br>
their creativity.  It seemed quite similar to the creative process of my own.<br>
<p>
The cross-pollination of artist and scientist is creating a well-balanced<br>
artist, if you will.  One with the unlimited imaginative capabilities and<br>
the ability to implement ideas with today's engineering and technology.  To<br>
have a dream - an inspiration - and not have the capability to realize the<br>
dream with the "tools of the time" can be very frustrating.  A lost dream<br>
can effect one's abilities in all areas of thinking, permeating a sense of<br>
failure.  To have a dream realized causes a sense of victory and self-esteem.<br>
<p>
Today an artist needs a working knowledge of technology and/or engineering<br>
to realize a dream fully.  (Conceptual art remains a preferred art genre<br>
for me, although I believe that I would be more satisfied and have a<br>
feeling of involvement with life and the future by producing ideas rather<br>
than only conceptualizing them.)<br>
<p>
Because Transhumanist Art and the genre Extropic Art is occurring in a<br>
period when we are engineering ourselves, extending lives and developing<br>
new life forms, an artist (in the broad sense: meaning fine artist,<br>
artists, and creative thinkers, which is inclusive of scientists) would be<br>
in keeping with the times if she/he is knowledgeable about the technology<br>
that will make this possible.  Otherwise the "art" becomes gadgets with no<br>
or little content.<br>
<p>
Much of the Tech Art and Electronic Art is quite beautiful to look at, or<br>
fascinating to look at or to engage in, but it does not represent the<br>
transhuman extropian culture because it does not pronounce life extension.<br>
("A-Volve" might even miss in this regard.)<br>
<p>
Recently I was entertaining Dr. Hugo de Garis (well known for brain<br>
building and ideas about genius that caused quite a stir on this list),<br>
Forrest Bishop and friends in my home.  We were discussing, among other<br>
things, de Garis's art project.<br>
<p>
Yesterday I had brunch with Dr. Roy Walford (leading gerontologist).  We<br>
discussed his most recent art project.  He is a scientist as well as artist.  <br>
<p>
Marvin Minsky plays the piano.  Vernor Vinge writes fiction.  My brother -<br>
Dr. Richard Clark - is a painter.  It isn't unusual for scientists to enjoy<br>
art, but this is not the point.  It is an ability to transfer the skills in<br>
the two different domains so that they begin to mesh.<br>
<p>
Thus, having skills in both domains does not make a Third Culture.  It is<br>
the acknowledgment of abilities in both domains and a willingness to say<br>
that art doesn't have to be only an intuitive, subjective and imaginative<br>
process and that science doesn't have to be only a rational objective<br>
process; and that both domains have qualities of the other.<br>
<p>
I wrote about the short essay "The Importance of Creativity" which in large<br>
part, refers to Paul's insightful post:<br>
<p>
"Tomorrow our CQ (creativity quotient) will become the sine qua non for our<br>
existence.  It will become less a measure of creative aptitude than an<br>
insight into undaunted inventiveness.  It will become the metaphor for<br>
individual escalation of innovation.  It will become a symbol for what we<br>
shall create without restraint, without limitation.  It will be the<br>
Creativity Augmentum."<br>
<p>
What I mean by the Creativity Augmentum is a time when the Snow's two<br>
cultures of art and science are blurred.  <br>
<p>
Art important in the extropian future?  Why, yes, of course!<br>
