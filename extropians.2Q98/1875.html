<p>
Ah.  You are correct; we have been talking past each other.  This poses<br>
new and very different problems.  For example, suppose you have licensed<br>
your information out to a hundred people.  Then, to your surprise, I,<br>
someone with whom you haven't contracted, begin to market this information<br>
publicly.  You can't sue me, because there is no contract binding ME from<br>
distributing your information.  Indeed, the only people whom you CAN sue<br>
are those to whom you have licensed information, and they all deny it. If<br>
I have managed to remove the fingerprints you have added to your<br>
information, then you have no way to recover your lost business.<br>
<p>
(For the purposes of this example, suppose this information had been<br>
distributed over something like TC May's BlackNet:  I bought the<br>
information from one of your licensees anonymously; I don't know whom I<br>
was dealing with, and neither do they, nor can anyone prove that I knew<br>
that I was buying the information from one of your licensees.)<br>
<p>
Right now, we create IP laws in order to get around this problem: we pass<br>
a law such that everyone is required not to use or distribute protected<br>
information without paying royalties to the author.  Without such laws, I<br>
could make an exchange like the one listed above, leaving you SOL. <br>
However, as you note, such laws are in no way grounded in "natural law":<br>
they would only be created because the contract was *too difficult to<br>
enforce otherwise.*<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the perspective of a PPA, I doubt I could find a PPA who would</i><br>
enforce a contract like that above at ANY price: cryptography over the<br>
Internet makes it such that there would be no way to identify the<br>
perpetrator.  Whom do you prosecute?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sorry, I just don't understand how someone who claims to be intelligent could come to such a nutty</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion. I hear your arguments all too often from many people, and they invariably turn out to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheapskates who want to get something for nothing. As you can tell by my sigline, I don't have much</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect for such people, and if I have transferred that disrespect toward you by association when it</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be unwarranted, accept my apologies. However if it does turn out to be warranted, please don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; take it personally....I'm an equal opportunity hater.</i><br>
<p>
Well, suffice it to say that I endorse contract law, and NOT enforcement<br>
of copyright beyond that.  However, I don't think that will protect<br>
inventors in any meaningful way; it would be as if IP did not exist at<br>
all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If there is no incentive to produce new technology, then economic growth will come to a screeching</i><br>
<i>&gt; halt. If everyone can copy whenever they want, then the product will no longer be bought, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; shared.  it would be interesting to see the welfare lines in Silicon Valley after that happens.....</i><br>
<p>
But despite the fact that contract law IP would be ineffective, there<br>
would STILL be an incentive to invent new technology; it would be smaller<br>
than that available today, but not zero.  I demonstrated this earlier this<br>
month;  see <a href="http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/4600.html">http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/4600.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, when prices fall beyond a certain point, it is no longer profitable for a producer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce a product and will go out of business. When a product can be freely copied, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer a market for the product.</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary; copies are cheap, but not free.  However much they cost<br>
to make, that's how much people will sell them for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And YES, I'm aware that incentive will decrease and that invention will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; decrease.  However, we will ALSO see an explosion in the copy market, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we will all save, as taxpayers, the cost of enforcing this law.  These two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; effects will OUTWEIGH the decrease in invention...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is the central, incredibly outrageous hogwash of your entire argument. An economy cannot grow</i><br>
<i>&gt; without advancing technology. With an increasing population and without rechnological advances to</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase resource utilization efficiency, economic stagnation will quickly result, bringing us back</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the dark ages.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course a nation that stops protecting IP will perform better, because it will be reducing its cash</i><br>
<i>&gt; outflow to pay for intellectual property rights held in other nations. Thus, it is externalizing its</i><br>
<i>&gt; costs to increase its net domestic product. It does not expand its gross domestic product except by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the capital savings that result. In this case, your argument will only work if ONE or SOME nations</i><br>
<i>&gt; fail to protect IP, as they then are externalizing their IP costs onto the economies of those that do</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect IP. When ALL nations fail to respect IP, then technological development will halt and</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic depression will result.</i><br>
<p>
As noted, technology would advance, only SLOWER.  For evidence of this,<br>
take a look at the Linux operating system.  It's covered by the GNU Public<br>
License: it is explicitly and forever available to be copied freely.  It<br>
advances slower than Windows, isn't as popular, but it's also available<br>
for much less.  Indeed, many people think that Red Hat 5 is BETTER than<br>
Windows NT, thanks to the open source policy.  It's also a hell of a lot<br>
cheaper, but NOT FREE: you'll see the Red Hat CD selling for ~$50 most<br>
places.<br>
<p>
Technology can and does advance without IP laws, only not quite so fast. <br>
It is also much cheaper.  This is just what my argument earlier would have<br>
qualitatively predicted, strong evidence that it is actually true. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes. We can compare nations that respect IP and those that don't. Excepting the IP which those</i><br>
<i>&gt; nations steal from other IP protecting nations, we can measure the economic growth which results from</i><br>
<i>&gt; domestically developed IP. China is an excellent example. During its cultural Revolution, there were</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtually no inventions developed in China, there was also zero economic growth. Once they opened</i><br>
<i>&gt; their economy, they started stealing IP from western nations. We can extimate as a result that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; of China's economic growth in the past 30 years is not due to domestic IP that is not protected, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; by foreign IP which is stolen and are therefore externalized costs that boost the Chinese economy.</i><br>
<p>
As always, there are a hundred reasons why China's economy would go the<br>
way it did.  I'd say the biggest one is probably that they switched to a<br>
planned economy, which is more than sufficient to kill growth in ALL<br>
industries; invention would cease because there were no rewards for<br>
increased efficiency AT ALL.  The economy's planned, so what's the<br>
point? <br>
<p>
If I'm right, IP was not the reason China had no inventions, but rather a<br>
planned economy was the death blow to innovation.  Can you separate these<br>
effects into "real numbers?"  If so, there's a Nobel prize in Economics in<br>
it for you if you'll just tell us how. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Don't give me percentages, give me numbers. I'll bet that Sasha Chislenko's economic simulator will</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily disprove your arguments.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; If you want, I can go seek out how large the software industry, the<br>
movie industry and the book binding industries are, and tell you that they<br>
would practically double in quantity as their prices dropped.  But that's<br>
really not enough information: we'd need to COMPARE this with the cost of<br>
enforcing IP laws; except that copyright ISN'T enforced on individuals the<br>
majority of the time; people copy video tapes, books and software all the<br>
time; we'd REALLY need to compare it against how much it WOULD cost to<br>
actually stop piracy.<br>
<p>
I haven't heard of Chislenko's economic simulator, (nor could I find it in<br>
a quick glance over Chislenko's web site,) but I somehow doubt that it can<br>
predict the shape of the demand curve for microeconomic markets.  In<br>
general, we can only determine this based on approximations based on<br>
marginal costs, quantity sold and prices over time; again presuming that<br>
demand isn't CHANGING during those periods (which it obviously is). <br>
Indeed, I'd guess that the simulator is a MACROecnomic simulator, which<br>
uses numbers which are much easier to measure: inflation, total GDP, the<br>
money supply, interest rates...  Yale's got one, too; it's quite good. <br>
Come take a look:  <a href="http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/">http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/</a><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, you won't find the quantity of inventions, books or<br>
software as any of the variables.<br>
<p>
To conclude, I can show that the area inside one shape is bigger than the<br>
area inside another shape without knowing how large either shape is.<br>
Based on their RELATIVE sizes, I can show that one microeconomic strategy<br>
would be superior to another; but even then I don't know how MUCH<br>
superior.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A reasonable competent fingerprint will make software not work at all if it is tampered with.</i><br>
<p>
Really?  Care to name a program that uses one such fingerprint?  ANY<br>
program?  I can basically guarantee you that if the program has sold more<br>
than a thousand copies, someone out on the net has bothered to break its<br>
copy protection.  There are archives of cracks available specifically for<br>
this purpose, with lots of reasonably competent programmers on BOTH sides<br>
of the battle lines.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You only make a microeconomic argument. You do not show anything about the macroeconomic systemic</i><br>
<i>&gt; impact.</i><br>
<p>
That's because I can't.  Neither could you if our situations were<br>
reversed, and you were arguing for the establishment of general (beyond<br>
contract) laws. It's one microeconomic market; there is no equation which<br>
will determine GDP based on the behavior of one market.  It's like asking<br>
me to predict how tall a growing child will be depending on whether they<br>
drink milk today or not.  They'll get some calcium, and as a trend the<br>
child will get taller as a result.  But how much taller, and how tall in<br>
the final outcome?  I can't say. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If people merely acted in compliance with the contracts they sign, then there would be no IP</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement costs. This goes back to my previous statements about subjectivity eroding respect for</i><br>
<i>&gt; contract law. You are proposing that people who produce intellectual property should not be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect their interests with contracts, or that people should not be bound by such contracts. Once</i><br>
<i>&gt; again you have exposed your subjectivist, post modern underbelly.</i><br>
<p>
Not at all; rather I assert that if this were the only protection<br>
inventors had against copyright infringement, they would have no<br>
protection at all, and that this would be economically superior to a<br>
system under which these contracts were supplemented by intrusive IP laws.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If the curve is not a line, but truly curved, then it will not be 0.5Q, but some other number. It may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be higher, it may be lower. In a commodity market, the curve makes this number very high, while in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopoly market, the curve can be rather low. You are only using a standard 1 for 1 slope on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; curve, which is inaccurate, disingenuous, and false.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I can be quite certain that it WOULD be 0.5Q.  See, the way I<br>
came across this was by the economic principle that in order for a<br>
monopoly to increase the quantity sold, it must lower the price twice as<br>
fast as a competitive business.  As a result of this effect, the marginal<br>
revenue curve WILL strike the P=0 line at 0.5Q.  Obviously, then, it would<br>
be false of me to claim that the market would fall by 50% unless the price<br>
was actually 0; I left myself a 10% margin for error.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A patent is worth more if it is as broad as possible. The most broad patents are concept patents,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while the most narrow are design patents. Even in design patents, an engineer will try to include as</i><br>
<i>&gt; many designs as possible, to shut out competition from routing around his property very easily. Even</i><br>
<i>&gt; then it is usually only a matter of time before someone does. The main advantage that a patent gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; an inventor or the company he licenses is product to is time enough to establish market presence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; fine tune production systems. Once you have established brand name presence in a market and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; refined your production system, usually, there is competition on the market using alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The purpose of the patent is to give the inventor (individual or corporation) the time to recoup the</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital costs of research and development, as well as the capital costs to establish a production</i><br>
<i>&gt; capacity. Failure to allow an inventor to recoup these costs is externalizing the costs from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; consumer to the inventor and producer and therefore stagnating technological development.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an expanding population, with stagnant economic growth and zero technological development, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resource base shrinks steadily (since technology is no longer increasing resource utilization</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiency or reducing resource acquisition costs).</i><br>
<p>
The inventor gets no EXTRA time to recoup losses.  And I agree, by<br>
externalizing, the pace of technological growth will slow, but it will not<br>
"stagnate."  The inventor will gain a percentage of the new market; if<br>
that percentage is larger than the cost of invention, then the inventor<br>
will invent.  If not, then they won't. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, static microeconomic models are no good at all at predicting the impact of changes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological advancement.</i><br>
<p>
Would you care to qualify this statement?  Could you give an example where<br>
microeconmics predicted something that empirically did not happen?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Too true!  So I had best BUY a copy of your manuscript, and then, using my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; property, organize my property just like the copies that belong to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You own the manuscripts and all of the words written on them; but if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sell a copy to me, then I own a copy, with all the words written on it.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can do with my property whatever I please, including organizing my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; property just like your property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I sell you the right to use my copy. You can use my copy to organize your own property any way you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want, however you cannot sell copies of the copy I sold you to anyone else.  If you sell the copy I</i><br>
<i>&gt; sold you to someone else, and delete all copies of that copy that may reside anywhere in your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; property, then it is not theft....since if you sell the copy to someone else, you are selling them</i><br>
<i>&gt; your right to use that copy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You cannot say that this sort of arrangement is not used in any other market, as real estate deed</i><br>
<i>&gt; covenants are widely used.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but you never try to make a covenant with multiple people for the<br>
same piece of real estate; when the lease is broken, you know precisely<br>
who broke it.  Nor can real estate be copied.  That makes this an<br>
excellent arrangement for real estate, but an inferior one for<br>
information.<br>
<p>
Indeed, what could you do to me if you DID lease land to me, and then I<br>
copied it and returned the land to you?  Even if this were forbidden by<br>
the lease, how would you know who had broken the contract if someone else<br>
started selling copies of your real estate who had purchased it from an<br>
anonymous seller?  After all, it could be me, or any of the other hundreds<br>
of customers you've serviced.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I dunno, the state owns plenty of property. As a sovereign government, in theory it holds original</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to all real property in its domain. People only own real property (i.e. real estate) as granted</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the sovereign in granted deeds. The sovereign holds right to reclaim those deeds under emminent</i><br>
<i>&gt; domain, provided the deed holder is refunded the original license fee, plus interest and compensation</i><br>
<i>&gt; for any improvements to the property.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed; this is how governments view property today; I think we're agreed<br>
that this understanding is inferior to the libertarian system described<br>
below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a theoretical libertarian society, where every man is sovereign, and is vassal to no state,</i><br>
<i>&gt; emminent domain would not exist per se, however IP will still exist in contract law. If you wish to</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit from my product, you must agree to not reproduce my product. If you break that contract, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are in breach and can be prosecuted in civil court by my PPL. Others who benefit from your breach can</i><br>
<i>&gt; also be sued, ad nauseum. It may take some precendent cases in a libertarian society, but IP will</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably be better respected in such a society then it even is currently here.</i><br>
<p>
As noted, I'm all in favor of this; except that I think you will find<br>
these contracts useless in the face of anonymous commerce.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Individuals do.  The sum of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wealth owned by individuals is not the property owned by society, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; simple sum of the property owned by those individuals.  I think we're</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; agreed on that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, however you forget the origination of those properties. In the example of real estate, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sovereign holds all original rights to all real estate in his or her or its domain. all other land</i><br>
<i>&gt; holders posess their land by granted deed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an information economy, I invented widget A, or software B. I hold original sovereign rights to</i><br>
<i>&gt; that widget or that software. I will only grant others the right to use copies of that widget or</i><br>
<i>&gt; software if they agree to the terms in my granted deed to use that property. If they do not, I hold</i><br>
<i>&gt; the right, by deeded contract, to prosecute their breach as I see fit. I could simply sue them in</i><br>
<i>&gt; civil court, have it 'corrected' by a contract 'fixer', or simply go and nuke the bastids.</i><br>
<p>
Remind me never to contract with you unless the terms of enforcement are<br>
made explicit.  ;)<br>
<p>
And again, I must agree with you here; only whom will you nuke when third<br>
parties start offering copies of your goods?  You don't have any contract<br>
over THEM.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; In light of that, your statement above is not correct: otherwise we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; forced to say that the sum of the property owned by individuals IS proprty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; owned by society.  However, we both agreed that society HAS no rights,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; especially not the right to own property, only the individuals have these</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rights.  Therefore, the sum of the property owned by individuals is NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the property owned by society.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That society may hold property as a sovereign government,  if individuals in that soceity are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; sovereign individuals, with some or all rights delegated to the state, then the state can own</i><br>
<i>&gt; property in trust for the benefit of all society.  THis is how things are presently. In a libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; society, individuals would only delegate those rights which they choose to delegate on an individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Similarly, I assert that we should maximize the sum of the utility for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; each individual; NOT the utility of the society, which is not a brain and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; therefore has no utility.  If I were arguing that society DID have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; utility, THAT would be collectivist.  THAT would be Borg-like.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Fortunately for the both of us, I'm not saying that at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes you are. You are measuring the utility of IP protection as a sum set, i.e. for all soceity. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not measuring it on an individual basis.</i><br>
<p>
The purpose of my parallel was to demonstrate that even if we accept a<br>
libertarian understanding of property rights, ANY economic analysis must<br>
make policy decisions based on net wealth; this is not wealth owned by<br>
society, but wealth owned by individuals.  I don't consider it in any way<br>
opposed to libertarianism to do so.  If arguments from net wealth are not<br>
collectivist, then arguments from net utility ought to be no more so. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree with the CONCEPT of your economci argument. I think that your numbers are completely wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Failure to protect IP will lead to the downfall of technological society.</i><br>
<p>
I say that it will not, and I therefore cede to you that we ought to<br>
enforce IP in contracts, but not as a law stating that no one may use<br>
protected information.<br>
