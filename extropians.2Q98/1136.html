IN EXPERIMENTS, circuits already are smelling for illegal drugs in place of<br>
canine patrols. French scientists are working on digital truffle-hunters,<br>
potentially replacing pigs that have for centuries rooted out these<br>
subterranean delicacies. In the commercial world, electronic noses serve as<br>
candidates for hundreds of applications, from testing apples for freshness<br>
to sniffing human breath for infections.But equipment so far is limited,<br>
cumbersome and expensive. A small start-up here aims to change that.Cyrano<br>
Sciences Inc. says it has technology that can be scaled down onto tiny<br>
chips, much like integrated circuits. Starting next year, it plans to<br>
market hand-held devices more the size of a bread slice than a bread<br>
box.Cyrano’s first product, a limited version of more ambitious instruments<br>
the company hopes to produce, is expected to be priced at about $3,000.<br>
That is a small fraction of the $25,000 to $100,000 price of current<br>
electronic noses, developed mostly in England and France.Cyrano’s<br>
technology was developed by researchers at the nearby California Institute<br>
of Technology. Various polymers, the basic substance of plastics, are mixed<br>
with grains of carbon. The hardened mixture, laid over two tiny contacts,<br>
creates a cell through which electrical current is passed. When exposed to<br>
specific vapors, the polymer swells like a tiny sponge. This, in turn,<br>
pulls the carbon grains apart, increasing the cell’s electrical resistance,<br>
a change that can be detected and analyzed. Using a palette of polymer<br>
cells, Cyrano says it can create a "nose" capable of discriminating between<br>
a wide range of odors.The company has yet to build a prototype, but it is a<br>
twist on existing technology, which relies on so-called conducting polymers<br>
instead of Cyrano’s use of ordinary nonconducting polymers and carbon to do<br>
much the same thing. Today’s "e-noses" are used mostly in laboratories and<br>
occasionally on production lines. Millions of cheap, limited sensors are in<br>
use, usually designed to detect specific gases or liquids. More-expensive<br>
devices can identify hundreds of components in substances, but don’t give a<br>
simple "yes" or "no" decision about product quality. Cyrano’s hopes its<br>
profiles of scents do exactly that.At current prices and maturity, the<br>
electronic-nose market is tiny: about $10 million in annual sales<br>
world-wide, industry executives estimate. But a tumble in prices and a<br>
surge in quality could change the picture. 	<br>
"We don’t think there’s a huge market for the current big boxes, but<br>
inexpensive, hand-held devices will be a breakthrough, we think," says<br>
Steven Sunshine, vice president for research and business development at<br>
closely held Cyrano. Imagine, suggests Mr. Sunshine, a day when electronic<br>
noses might be used in home kitchens to check milk freshness or scan the<br>
fridge for tired vegetables.That depends on production breakthroughs, and,<br>
competitors argue, perhaps even improvements in basic design. For starters,<br>
Cyrano must automate and miniaturize a hand production process. The<br>
company’s first product calls for four separate chips with eight vapor<br>
sensors on each, or a total of 32 sensors. Each sensor is a dot of<br>
polymer/carbon mix about a millimeter square. Readings from these sensors<br>
in turn are to be analyzed by a microprocessor trained to recognize certain<br>
patterns as "smells," much as the human brain does with signals from the<br>
sensors in our nose.That is just a crude beginning. Cyrano’s "nose on a<br>
chip" calls for as many as 10,000 sensor cells on a single chip. "It’s not<br>
a challenge that violates the laws for physics, but it’s a big challenge to<br>
do again and again, day after day," says Richard S. Payne, Cyrano’s chief<br>
technology officer. Tiny jetting equipment today can produce depositions<br>
only about 20 times that size, Mr. Payne says.Cyrano’s competitors are<br>
skeptical. "They can say anything they want to, but without a product, what<br>
they’ll market is a complete mystery to us," says John Poling, president of<br>
the U.S. unit of Alpha M.O.S. SA of Toulouse, France, a major, early<br>
producer of electronic noses. Other companies include Neotronics Scientific<br>
Ltd., based in Stansted, England, and AromaScan PLC, based in Crewe.As for<br>
Cyrano’s assertion that its nose is more versatile and less sensitive than<br>
others to humidity and temperature change, "that’s a claim we all make,"<br>
says Jennifer Cyr, product specialist at AromaScan’s U.S. office. 	<br>
	None of this has slowed Cyrano, formed a year ago with rights to Caltech’s<br>
technology and $3 million in funding from the venture capital firms of Oak<br>
Investment Partners, Marquette Venture Partners, and J &amp; J Development<br>
Corp., an investment arm of Johnson &amp; Johnson. A second round of $9 million<br>
in financing was raised from the same partners earlier this month.While<br>
more will be needed when production starts, current funds will take the<br>
company well down the road to volume production, company officials say.Off<br>
in the future, an idea beckons: "Aroma profiles" of wines might be kept in<br>
store computers, allowing customers to match them with computerized records<br>
of favorite wines. Added patterns could be downloaded from the Internet,<br>
giving new meaning to the "nose" of an uncorked bottle of wine. "It’s not<br>
on our short list," Dr. Sunshine says, "but it’s certainly possible."<br>
