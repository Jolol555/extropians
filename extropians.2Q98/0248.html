But suppose one were to comment, pari passu,<br>
<p>
&lt; Capitalists know that their fondest dreams<br>

that don't are either liars or fools &gt;<br>
<p>
My experience suggests that both these accounts, while strictly true only<br>
in extreme but exemplary cases, go a long way toward explaining the world I<br>
live in.  In the last couple of days, a conservative government-supported<br>
stevedoring company sacked more than 2000 unionists on Australian wharves<br>
simply for being members of the union, locking them out and patrolling the<br>
wharves with private muscle and rottweilers.  Workers rallying in protest<br>
have been attacked illegally by irritant gas, which is as close to a gun<br>
against the head as one might wish to see in industrial practice at the<br>
close of the 20th century.  This argues, incidentally, against the claim<br>
that workers can invest on equable terms by command of their own labour.<br>
