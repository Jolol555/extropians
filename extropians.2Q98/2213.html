<i>&gt; My own perspective on this is that the NodeNet forums should incorporate a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable degree of exclusivity. We do indeed want to build a strong</i><br>
<i>&gt; reputation for ExI. The lists will not be open to all. They will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; restricted to ExI members, and only those applying members whom each</i><br>
<i>&gt; NodeMaster deems appropriate or qualified for a forum.</i><br>
<p>
Since such list will only be open to *members*, how will any of this improve<br>
ExI' overall reputation?  A post I made awhile back suggested that rather than<br>
require membership to read the contents of NodeNet, that a small reasonable<br>
subscription fee be instituted as a way of covering costs.  Membership in ExI<br>
could then include a subscription to NodeNet as well as other perks and<br>
discounts on books, conferences, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, to address Reilly's concern, the criteria of "qualified" will vary</i><br>
<i>&gt; for each list. Even if desirable (and I agree it is not), qualifications need</i><br>
<i>&gt; not be academic degrees. (Requiring higher -- or any -- degree in relevant</i><br>
<i>&gt; fields, given the size of ExI's membership, would guarantee very little</i><br>
<i>&gt; participation!)</i><br>
<p>
I can't help getting the feeling though that somehow such a system will in<br>
short time be abused by the occasional shortcomings of the NodeMaster, where<br>
personal feelings, egos and the like will keep otherwise intelligent posters<br>
from being included.  Also, the intrinsic exclusivity of the NodeNet is almost<br>
completely retrograde to the evolution of the Net as a spontaneously ordered,<br>
open, agoric, free-marketplace of ideas.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For highly technical forums, we probably want to be more restrictive in</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing members to be posting-enabled Participants. Here, either a formal</i><br>
<i>&gt; background in the topic, or demonstrated knowledge in writings, previous</i><br>
<i>&gt; email list postings, etc. would count.</i><br>
<p>
This is probably a good idea, which is why such high caliber content should not<br>
be restricted to those with ExI membership.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For other forums, especially highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; cross-disciplinary ones, or more practically focused ones, the default</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be that all applicants can be participants, with the NodeMaster</i><br>
<i>&gt; merely screening out those who have shown little substantive imput in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; past.</i><br>
<p>
All I can say here, is I hope such an idealistic scenario works.  As Heinlien<br>
once said "Specialization is for insects", and as Extropians, cross-pollination<br>
is becoming more and more the benchmark for informed debate.<br>
<p>
In this time of flag-buring and prayer amendments, new and improved<br>
communication decency act legislation and cloning bans, the rational, positive<br>
and life-affirming agendas of the trashumanist community are needed more than<br>
ever.  I just hope that the proposals you are making Max are the ones that will<br>
proliferate extropian ideas and not exclude them to the select few.<br>
<p>
<p>
Most Sincerely,<br>
<p>
Paul Hughes<br>
