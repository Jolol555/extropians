<i>&gt;From what I can see of the DayStar Magazine's principals, it is a welcome</i><br>
progression in creationist publication.  I note that the magazine does not<br>
purport to be a "science journal", and is not being sold as such.  The<br>
"science section" is probably a fitting place for it.  "Popular Science" is<br>
hardly a science journal!  If you are going to attack this magazine, it must<br>
be because of what it says, not who publishes it and for what reason.  Are<br>
the articles balanced and reasonable, or full of lies and distortion like<br>
much creationist writing?  Believe it or not, there are people who believe<br>
in Special Creation who are principled and not stupid.  These people, by and<br>
large, are NOT fundamentalists.<br>
<p>
There is a subset of the creationist movement that has distanced themselves<br>
from fundamentalist lunacy such as that written by Gish etc.  The focus here<br>
is on the "cosmic coincidence problem", as in, why are the initial<br>
conditions of the universe so fitting for life to exist.  This is not a<br>
trivial problem, and cannot be written off as "mere chance".  I happen to<br>
believe that an anthropic argument coupled with a multi-verse is sufficient<br>
to explain this universe's initial conditions, but there is room here for<br>
those who wish to believe in a creator to find their niche.  If this<br>
magazine can provide an honest,  balanced environment, I welcome it.<br>
