     From the April 17,1998 Vancouver Sun - Canadian Press<br>
<p>
   Corbeil, Ontario - Marie Loise Meilleur, the world's oldest person, has<br>
 died at the age of 117.<br>
   Her daughter Olive Therrien said Meilleur died peacefully Thursday<br>
 afternoon at the Nipissing Manor nursing home where she had lived for the<br>
 past 10 years.<br>
   "She's been very well until last week," said Therrien, 78 of<br>
 Peterborough, Ont. "She got a blood clot in her leg, and it moved from<br>
 her leg into her lung."<br>
   Meilleur had 10 children from two marriages, most of whom have died,<br>
 Therrien told the Peterborough Examiner.<br>
   "She looked after her family. She was a wonderful person."<br>
   Meilleur is survived by three daughters and one son. The oldest is 89,<br>
 a daughter who lives in Barrie, Ont.<br>
   Born Aug. 29,1880, in Kamouraska, Que., Meilleur celebrated her 117th<br>
 birthday last August at a celebration attended by family, friends, and a<br>
 host of dignitaries, including Premier Mike Harris.<br>
   At the celebration, her 72-year-old daughter Rita Gutzman explained the<br>
 secret (of) Meilleur's long life was hard work.<br>
   "She said hard work could never kill a person," Gutzman said.<br>
   Because she was almost blind and could barely hear, it's not clear<br>
 whether she realized she had been designated the world's oldest person.<br>
   She assumed the mantle after the death of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment at<br>
 age 122. The Guinness Book of World Records accepted Meilleur because<br>
 some of the other contenders didn't have the documentation Guinness<br>
 requires.<br>
   She had 85 grandchildren, 80 great-grandchildren, 57<br>
 great-great-grandchildren and four great-great-great-grandchildren.<br>
   Affectionately known as Memere to her family, she had walked into the<br>
 Nipissing Manor home with only the aid of a cane in 1988 at the tender<br>
 age of 107. She had been living in Deep River, Ont.<br>
   No arrangements have been made yet for the funeral, Therrien said.<br>
 Endquote.<br>
 Note:<br>
   Marie Meilleur had a propensity to get a lot of exercise, in common<br>
 with Jeanne Calment, who rode a bicycle until the age of 100.<br>
   Exercise has been found to be a protective factor in old people in<br>
 (Arch Intern Med 157: 2249-2258 1997). The following is Table 6 from this<br>
 report listing a mutlivariate analysis of all-cause mortality in<br>
