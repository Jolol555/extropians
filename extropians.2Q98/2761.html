Egoism would say yes.  However, that is another way of saying that egoism<br>
concedes that it is not rational for everyone to accept egoism, which<br>
would mean that egoism is wrong by the generalization principle.  To<br>
accept egoism at that point would be irrational.  Same goes for relying on<br>
the irrationality of others.<br>

If you believe that, then the argument is over.  There's nothing I can do<br>
or say which could prove that rationality is right, because I must<br>
necessarily do so within the boundaries of rationality.  Meanwhile, I<br>
personally am not very likely to be persuaded to accept an irrational<br>
ethical theory, particularly since I *have* a rational ethical theory<br>
which seems to work. <br>
<p>
We cannot debate the merits of utilitarianism against the merits of an<br>
ethical system based on close scrutiny of biblical scriptures, because the<br>
Bible is not derived from well-understood, undeniable axioms.  Though<br>
attempts have been made to prove that God must exist, I have not seen any<br>
which succeed; if God is deniable then the Bible itself is unfounded. <br>
People believe it anyway, however, because they have faith that it is<br>
true.  How can an argument from rationality argue with that? <br>
