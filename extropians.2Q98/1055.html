- From the FAQ:<br>
<p>
What are extropians doing to improve their life expectancy?<br>
<p>
         Many are supplementing their diets with significant quantities of<br>
         vitamins and minerals, such as: <br>
<p>
             most B vitamins, <br>
             beta carotene, <br>
             vitamins C and E, <br>
             chromium picolinate, <br>
             zinc, <br>
             and selenium. <br>
<p>
         It is widely theorized that free radicals are responsible for many of<br>
         the problems associated with aging, and many vitamins are known<br>
         to remove free radicals from the body. Also, there are a fair<br>
         number of animal studies showing that vitamins and minerals<br>
         improve health and life expectancies. <br>
<p>
         An important book on this subject is: <br>
<p>
             Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach, by Durk<br>
             Pearson and Sandy Shaw (1982). <br>
<p>
         I feel compelled to warn readers that some of their claims may be<br>
         exaggerated. <br>
<p>
         Caloric Restriction is also a popular idea among extropians, as<br>
         there is substantial evidence that it will increase maximum<br>
         lifespans. For more info, read: <br>
<p>
             The 120-year Diet, by Roy L. Walford (1986) <br>
<p>
             The Anti-Aging Plan, by Roy L. Walford and Lisa<br>
             Walford (1994) <br>
<p>
         Vegetarian and Vegan diets are also popular among extropians, and<br>
         high- fat foods are frequently criticized. <br>
<p>
         For more information, read the newsgroup sci.life-extension, or its<br>
         FAQ, which can be ftp'd from sunsite.unc.edu in directory:<br>
         /pub/academic/medicine/alternative-healthcare/faqs/life-extension.<br>
<p>
<p>
and<br>
<p>
Do extropians live differently, or is it all theory?<br>
<p>
         Some people who espouse extropian ideas do live<br>
         indistinguishably from their neighbors, but here are some of<br>
         the things that extropians are doing right now or have done<br>
         already. Many extropians are deliberately designing and<br>
         pursuing their own life extension programs relying on<br>
         dietary changes, nutrient supplementation, exercise, use of<br>
         pharmaceuticals with demonstrated life-extending effects,<br>
         and regular laboratory tests of biomarkers of aging. Many<br>
         extropians have arranged legally and financially for cryonic<br>
         biostasis in the event of their accidental deanimation.<br>
         Extropians have made career choices based on their<br>
         extropian ideas; many are software engineers,<br>
         neuroscientists, aerospace engineers, cryptologists, privacy<br>
         consultants, designers of institutions, mathematicians,<br>
         philosophers, and medical doctors researching<br>
         life-extension techniques. Some extropians are very active<br>
         in libertarian politics, and in legal challenges to abuse of<br>
         government power. What most extropians do consistently<br>
         and often is think hard about, and discuss, the changes the<br>
         future will bring, thereby immunizing themselves against<br>
         future shock and helping to prepare themselves to take<br>
         advantage of the opportunities (and protect against the<br>
         dangers) that future developments will bring. <br>
<p>
         Romana Machado has written an essay addressing this<br>
         question, entitled "Five Things You Can Do To Fight<br>
         Entropy Now." In this essay, she discusses techniques<br>
         extropians have used to advance their physical health,<br>
         mental health, self-defense, financial security, and<br>
         preparation for accidental deanimation. The essay has been<br>
         published in EXTRO 1: Proceedings of the First Extropy<br>
         Institute Conference. <br>
<p>
Also, many extropians have signed up for cryonic suspension.  You can<br>
search the mailing list archives for this one.  Alcor, at<br>
<a href="http://www.alcor.com">http://www.alcor.com</a> seems to be the most popular organization, or at least<br>
the most visible.<br>
