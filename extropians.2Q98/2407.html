The story of Herod's massacre of the children of Bethlehem is probably a<br>
fabrication of Matthew.  Luke doesn't mention it, nor does Josephus, the<br>
historian who dillegently recorded Herod's many crimes.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thus it is rather obvious as to why the Romans were so keen on stringing<br>
Jesus<br>
up, eh? Reuniting all of the houses and tribes of Isreal under one man (who<br>
would probably have been Jesus, or possibly his son by Mary Magdalene)<br>
would<br>
seem to me to spell a serious threat to Roman control of Palestine through<br>
the<br>
rule of King Herod, their lackey. This also explains why King Herod was so<br>
keen<br>
on killing every child born on or around  the prophesied day in Bethlehem.<br>
In<br>
order to fulfill the prophesy, the people who worked to bring this breeding<br>
plan<br>
to fruition would have to arrange that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem on<br>
or<br>
around the right day.<br>
