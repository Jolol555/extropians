&lt;&lt; Oh yes they can. Credit card and debit card purchases directly access<br>
nationwide<br>
 financial databases. Authorities have the ability to put 'sniffers' on these<br>
 systems to track people by their purchase locations. This applies to hotels,<br>
 restaurants, etc. In fact,  my bank was able to track me down while I was on<br>
 vacation last month to notify me of an account problem. Its kind of odd to<br>
get a<br>
 phone call from your personal banker while having after dinner<br>
coffee......500<br>
 miles away from home.... I shiver at the thought that some government fascist<br>
 might track me down and drag me away merely by my participation in the<br>
economy.<br>

No, you missed the point of that part of the article.  The author didn't mean<br>
track as in note when and where you used your government ID card (since the<br>
government would OF COURSE be aware of when and where you used it, presumably,<br>
excluding the use of it for entrance into clubs or such) but meant that the<br>
government could actually track your movements even when you didn't use it.<br>
