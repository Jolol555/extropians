<i>&gt;&gt;* What are the data requirements of transmitting a</i><br>
person?  What if the traveller is enhanced with extra<br>
memory -- do you charge by the gigabyte, or have a<br>
fixed rate for everybody?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Rough estimate: 10^11 neurons, 10^4 synapses each,</i><br>
five bytes per synapse (where it is connected,<br>
synaptic strength) = 5*10^15 bytes. If you want to<br>
scan the whole body, you will need *huge* amounts of<br>
bandwidth (remember, one mol is 10^23 atoms...). <br>
<p>
There is an amusing scenario in Greg Egan's story<br>
"The Planck Dive" (Asimov's Science Fiction, February<br>
1998) where some folks are 'faxing' themselves across<br>
a StarNet-like system:<br>
<p>
"The first of the two visitors was still standing<br>
patiently at the end of the pier ... Her fellow<br>
traveler, still in transit, was represented by a<br>
motionless placeholder. Both icons were highly<br>
anatomical-realist ... <br>
<p>
'You're here to observe the Planck Dive?' Gisela<br>
chose to betray no hint of puzzlement; it would have<br>
been pointlessly cruel to drive home the fact that<br>
they could have seen everything from Athena. Even if<br>
you fetishized realtime data over lightspeed<br>
transmissions, it could hardly be worth slipping 194<br>
years out of synch with your fellow citizens". <br>
<p>
Gisela &amp; Cordelia then go off to tour a "scape" of<br>
the black hole while waiting for Prospero to finish<br>
his transmission because he's brought his entire<br>
castle along with him! Gisela winces: "It was a good<br>
thing they'd compressed their accommodation more<br>
efficiently than their bodies, or they would have<br>
tied up the gamma ray link for about a decade". <br>
<p>
BTW, Prospero turns out to be a type that Extropians<br>
would love to hate: he's an anachronistic flesher<br>
bard "come to create enigmas, not explanations" and<br>
thinks that "To extract the mythic essence, mere<br>
detail must become subservient to a deeper truth".<br>
