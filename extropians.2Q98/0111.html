The LFS also has chosen five classic novels as finalists for the Prometheus<br>

<p>
* "Orion Shall Rise," by Poul Anderson (1983)<br>
* "Time Enough for Love" by Robert Heinlein (1973)<br>
* "The Mirror Maze" by James Hogan (1989)<br>
* "Planet for Texans" ("Lone Star Planet") by H. Beam Piper, cowritten with<br>

* "WASP" by Eric Frank Russell (1957)<br>
<p>
Winners, who receive a gold coin and plaque, will be announced in the<br>
Libertarian Futurist Society's annual awards ceremony at the 1998 World<br>
Science Fiction Convention in early August in Baltimore.<br>
<p>
This marks the 20th anniversary of the Prometheus Award, which was founded in<br>
1979 when a group led by L. Neil Smith presented the first award to F. Paul<br>
Wilson for "Wheels Within Wheels." In 1982, the Libertarian Futurist Society<br>
was founded by Michael Grossberg to continue the Prometheus Awards, so this is<br>
the 18th awards presentation.  Previous winners include Vernor Vinge, James P.<br>
Hogan, Brad Linaweaver, Victor Koman, F. Paul Wilson, Poul Anderson, and Smith<br>
(who since 1981 has not been associated with the awards judging.)<br>
<p>
Fourteen novels were nominated by LFS members this past year for the<br>
Prometheus Awards; and 21 novels were nominated for the Hall of Fame. Other<br>
Prometheus Award nominees: "In The Shadow of Omen," by Steven Burgauer (Zero-G<br>
Press); "Lightpaths," by Howard Hendrix (Ace Science Fiction); "Atlantis," by<br>
Robert Klassen (White Knight Publishing, Internet only),; "Freedom's Choice"<br>
by Anne McCaffrey (Ace/Putnam); "A Mind for Trade" by Andre Norton and<br>
Sherwood Smith (TOR);  "Exiles: The Mageborn Traitor by Melanie Rawn (DAW<br>
Books); "The Merro Tree," by Katie Waitman (Del Rey Discovery); "City on<br>
Fire," by Walter Jon Williams (Harper Prism); and "Deep as the Marrow," by F.<br>
Paul Wilson (TOR).<br>
<p>
Both LFS awards honor outstanding science fiction/fantasy that explore the<br>
possibilities of a free future, champion human rights (including personal and<br>
economic liberty), dramatize the perennial conflict between individuals and<br>
coercive governments, or critique the tragic consequences of abuse of power--<br>
especially by the  State. Past awardwinners range from Robert Heinlein and Ayn<br>
Rand to Ray Bradbury and Ursula LeGuin.<br>
<p>
For the first time last fall, the Society established two annual judging<br>
committees to choose finalists for the Prometheus Award and Hall of Fame. LFS<br>
Director Victoria Varga chaired the Hall of Fame committee, whose members<br>
included Tod Casasent, Charles Curley, John Fast, Chris Hibbert, Carol B. Low,<br>
Lynn Maners, William Stoddard, Fran Van Cleave.  LFS founder /Life member<br>
Michael Grossberg chaired the Prometheus Awards committee. Members: Fast,<br>
Steve Gaalema, Hibbert, Victor Koman, Tom Lauerman, Maners, Adam Starchild,<br>
and Claire Wolfe.  The 1999 Prometheus  committee, for novels published in<br>
1998, will be appointed in July. As always, all LFS Advisory members will read<br>
the finalists and choose the Prometheus Award winner. and all Basic and<br>
Advisory members will read the Hall finalists and vote for the Hall of Fame<br>
winner.<br>
<p>
Since 1982, the Prometheus Award has been  presented each year at the World<br>
Science Fiction Convention, making it one of the most enduring awards after<br>
the Nebula and Hugo awards, and one of the oldest fan-based awards currently<br>
in sf. The Hall of Fame, established in 1983, focuses on older classics.<br>
<p>
The Society, which publishes the quarterly Prometheus, made history last year<br>
when Victor Koman's "Kings of the High Frontier" won the 1997 Prometheus<br>
Award. In a living embodiment of libertarian futurism, it was the first time<br>
an electronic/Internet-only novel won a major award.<br>
