<i>&gt; is there extropian thought to be found in popular</i><br>
<i>&gt; entertainment?  i nominate the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; music:  what a beautiful world this will be  (~1983, artist unknown)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; movies:  contact, or 2001 a space odyssey</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; literature:  ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; television:  six million dollar man?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Not being in touch with popular entertainment is one thing, but you <br>
left out some very important specimen.<br>
In music, the whole genre of electronic music, from minimalistic <br>
techno to grandiose ambient, the whole thing is about what you call <br>
Extropia or transhumanism. Listen to FutureSoundOfLondon's trilogy <br>
Lifeforms, ISDN and Dead Cities. If this isn't transhumanism in music <br>
(granted, in an abstract manner) I don't know what is.<br>
In movies, well, some of Cronenberg's all time sci-fi megahits, <br>
Scanners and VideoDrome deal with this issue in the most intelligent <br>
and sophisticated way I've seen. And if you're in the Cronenberg <br>
shelf, check out The Brood and maybe even The  Fly and The Dead <br>
Zone, though they're not such good films, they all talk about <br>
"transhumanism".<br>
Let us not forget the Japanese cult classic Tetsuo: The Iron Man, a <br>
hard-to-watch-but-still-worth-it ultrapiece.<br>
There are many many more, these are just the most notable.<br>
In literature the examples are too many to name, I'm sure that if you <br>
throw a stone in the sci-fi section of any bookstore you'll have at <br>
least a 20% chance of hitting one.<br>
What's left? Oh yes. The wonderbox. A transhumanity engine in itself <br>
if you ask me. Well, being the most popular and populistic of the <br>
mediums listed, there isn't much room there for fringe philosophy so <br>
there aren't very many shows that dealt with that. I can't think of <br>
any important non-cartoon extropian show apart from the one you <br>
mentioned, but I'm sure there are, and even surer there will be.<br>
