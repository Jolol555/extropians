Hi Dan,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I havn't told from competetion. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have asked if you noticed the inner structure of industrial companies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;make decisions and not their relationship to buyers/customers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What?  That they're hierarchical?  Yes, I had noticed this.  This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they are in competition.  However, they differ in their essense for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the reasons I just got through telling you.</i><br>
<p>
No. They are hierarchical because they have had an history of okonomy. Do  <br>
you know f. exsample the industrial history of time? Do you know f. exsam- <br>
ple the industrial history of work-organisation and work-structures? Do  <br>
you know, that the first industries had been "working-houses" for the  <br>
poor? Do you realy knowing the diffrents between the short industrial  <br>
history of USA and the much longer industrial history of Europe since the  <br>
middle age?<br>
<p>
Do you know that we have in Europe 25% non-hierarchical co-operations in  <br>
competition? They don't need any hierarchy to survive in competition. So  <br>
your thesis, that firms and groups in competition have hierarchical struc- <br>
tures cannot explain the entire reality.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;See above. Therefore this statement is wrong. Workers and their managment</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;inside the industrial world are forced to co-operate: the managment have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to co-operate with their workers because they cannot produce without wor-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;kers and the workers have to co-operate with the managment, because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;need their wages to survive and therefore they have to acept that the ma-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;nagment have command of their work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah, the Marxist fallacy: that the workers cannot survive without the firm's</i><br>
<i>&gt; wages.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, the Middleclass dream -- the great illusion. Workers are "free" to  <br>
live without wages. I see, that you don't want to discuss about interest  <br>
and who bear interests because you possibly lose there your positive pic- <br>
ture of the good capitalism. But I'm not a Marxist.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I know you're probably opposed to the very idea, but try reading an</i><br>
<i>&gt; introductory neo-classical microeconomics textbook.  (It's important to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand the language of your enemy.  ;)  Hell, I've read _Capital_.)</i><br>
<p>
You don't know that I have had studied okonomy.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, this theory of labor would be true if, and only if, the firm could</i><br>
<i>&gt; offer any wages it wanted.  This is not the case however, and would be true</i><br>
<i>&gt; if, and only if, it were the only buyer of labor (a monopsony).  You see,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when firms are in competition, workers will tend to apply for jobs which</i><br>
<i>&gt; offer higher wages.  As a result, a firm which offers higher wages can</i><br>
<i>&gt; afford higher quality workers, and offer a better product.  In theoretical</i><br>
<i>&gt; "perfect competition," firms cannot set wages at all, but rather must</i><br>
<i>&gt; accept the market price: by setting wages any higher, they wouldn't make</i><br>
<i>&gt; any money, and by setting them any lower, they wouldn't have any workers.</i><br>
<p>
What a nice simple picture. Unfortunately is this only a picture. Why are  <br>
the high of wages in relation to the spending power on the same level as  <br>
1970? Where comes your higher quality workers? Out of the Sky? Or must we  <br>
spend money to give workers a better qualification?<br>
<p>
Who produce your products? The managment? Of course, the workers. Only  <br>
work gave the managment products to sell. So the managment need workers.  <br>
And the managment need buyers to sell their products and to survive in  <br>
competition. Every product have a price -- and this price is subordinated  <br>
to all other prices for the same product of other firms who act in the  <br>
same business. The competition force the high of the price who the firms  <br>
can earn at the market. This price represent partly the costs of produc- <br>
tion: interests, materialcosts, firmownerloans, costs of promotion, tax,  <br>
wages etc. If one buyer buy a product than he pay all this costs. And the  <br>
majority of this buyers are workers who spend their money which they earn  <br>
as wage.<br>
<p>
Every firm hope to earn more money if they selling their products as they  <br>
have had spend to produce them. Marx call this "Mehrwert" -- value adding.  <br>
And every firm payed wages to the workers who are under that value adding,  <br>
because their workers work is just one point in the list of cost of pro- <br>
ducing. -- This is the theory of labor which you don't reject with your  <br>
nice picture above. The workers can only earn wages who are under that va- <br>
lue adding who pay capital gains of capital investments by as well firm  <br>
owners as outside capital owners.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; When there is only ONE buyer of labor, however, the firm has complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom to set the price of labor to be whatever it wants, which workers</i><br>
<i>&gt; must accept because there is no one else to whom they can sell labor.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is how Marx viewed the labor market, and it is clearly wrong, which we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; observe empirically: there are MANY different firms out there, each</i><br>
<i>&gt; offering different wages and producing goods of different quality.</i><br>
<p>
Nonsense.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even under a monopsony, however, workers can increase their wages through</i><br>
<i>&gt; investment; in this case, strikes.  In this form of wage investment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; workers forego today's earnings in exchange for an increase in wages from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; firm; this can even take place under a monopsony.  Marx presumed that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be impossible because the proletariat are property-less (or nearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; so) and therefore too destitute to survive a strike.</i><br>
<p>
You forgot here the back of this class war. If the firms space out there  <br>
workers and force them to live from there wages investments in the union  <br>
than the workers must return to work if their collectively owned money is  <br>
out. Than they have to acept every wage because they need money to survi- <br>
ve. And every firm are able to dismiss all striking workers and to hire  <br>
other workers.<br>
<p>
Many firms didn't acepted union members generally. In the USA are just 15%  <br>
of all workers in an union.... I think, you have to notice that we have an  <br>
diffrent capitalism after the New Deal of 1913 -- which Marx who died seve- <br>
ral years before havn't known.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But thanks to the competition which does exist, workers are NOT destitute,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and do not depend entirely on one firm's wages to survive.  Using their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; savings, (which Marx presumed would not exist under capitalism,) workers</i><br>
<i>&gt; can and do successfully invest in their own wages by striking.  If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; labor market looked as you suggest it does, then this would be totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible.</i><br>
<p>
I don't suggest this. I havn't proposed that workers are forced to earn  <br>
wages of one firm's to survive. I have proposed that workers are forced to  <br>
sell their work and have therefore to be on the staff of one of the phara- <br>
os. They could only change their jobs if there are other firms in their re- <br>
gion who seek for new workers in their training-groups. If they lose there  <br>
jobs and havn't the right qualification than they are unenployed -- inde-  <br>
pended of how industrious they are.<br>
<p>
Your mistake is, that your thinking about the labor market use a universal  <br>
worker and don't deal with workers of diffrent qualifications. A worker  <br>
with the qualification to assemble cars cannot produce tomorrow computer- <br>
chips without a long training to get a new qualification. A doctor who ha-  <br>
ve studied physik couldn't sell his work as a doctore of medicine.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately are 51% of all costs of labor costs of transactions; it's  <br>
cheaper for the firm's today and tomorrow to do this work with a PC. 51%  <br>
of all jobs get lost in the coming time sequence of the next 30 years. All  <br>
other jobs will in future need more and more an academic qualification.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The structure of the military is as well hirarchically as the structure of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the industry. Both have structures where competence and responsibility are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;split from the top to the bottom; the people on the top make the decisions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and have a high responsibillity whereas the people at the bottom carry out</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;orders with a low responsibillity; only the managment -- the industrial ge-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;neral staff -- could change the production and the structure of the firm</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and have command of this structure of working.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is true.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and therefore the real capitalism is for myself in opposite to "spon- <br>
taneous orders".<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Nico<br>
