<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree.  Information is completely immaterial.  Conisder:  I am a</i><br>
<i>&gt; novelist who has written a book.  I have taken energy, ink and paper and</i><br>
<i>&gt; turned them into a draft.  If I submit this draft to my publisher, he</i><br>
<i>&gt; could publish it.  Obviously, I have added value to the ink, paper and</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy by writing my novel.  (Let's imagine for a moment that my novel is</i><br>
<i>&gt; good.  :) )</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the act of writing a novel is a service. The resultant manuscript is a product. Do you see<br>
the difference? One is kinetic and the other is static.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, if I gave YOU the same ink, paper and energy and told you to</i><br>
<i>&gt; write my novel, you couldn't do it.  You probably couldn't even do it if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; gave you TWICE as much energy.  Why?  Because you would not know what my</i><br>
<i>&gt; novel says or is about: you would not have the information.</i><br>
<p>
Because I cannot produce exactly the same service as you. However, if I were given an outline<br>
of the novel, descriptions of the characters, I could certainly create a reasonable facsimile<br>
of the novel that you would have produced. My writing the novel is a service, the resultant<br>
manuscript is a product.... get it yet?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The fact that given ample matter and ample energy you could not generate</i><br>
<i>&gt; my information means that it is a very different process from widget</i><br>
<i>&gt; making, which economics presumes CAN be done by anyone with enough labor</i><br>
<i>&gt; and capital.</i><br>
<p>
No, if I do not give another manufacturer exact plans for the widget I produce, then by<br>
definition his widget is going to be slightly different. Even if I tell manufacturer A and<br>
Manufacturer B to make a widget that does Job A in Manner B, they will still be slightly<br>
different, but will do the same job. Cases in point:<br>
<p>
1) Jeep Cherokee and Ford Explorer<br>
2) F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mig-29 Fulcrum<br>
3) La Cage Aux Folles (sp?) and The Birdcage<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; A service is work, a kinetic, not a static state. Information is static like any other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; product. Transmitting information is doing work as it is a kinetic action, expending</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; energy to do work, so the act of transmission is a service, and the act of agreeing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lend someone the use of my information for specific purposes on the condition that you do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not reproduce my information to sell to others is also a service. The information which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is lent is still a product.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Information is also unlike a product in that, unless I forget about it, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can never return it to you, nor have you lost your use of it while I</i><br>
<i>&gt; borrow it.  Whether or not you agree that this is a service rather than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; product, I think you must admit that this an attribute which is unique</i><br>
<i>&gt; to information; I argue that it is because of this unique property that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; should not enforce property rights over it.</i><br>
<p>
This is why it is most important to enforce property rights on it. This is why the word is COPY<br>
- RIGHT, or right to copy, get it?<br>
<p>
It is important because information is very easy to reproduce, while much more substantive<br>
products are not so easy to reproduce. Especially with software, if there is no way an<br>
individual or company can hope to get paid for its software, if the first person to buy a copy<br>
goes out and gives away copies to everyone, then there will be no incentive to produce software<br>
and the industry will die, or at least become severely retarded. The only way to make money in<br>
software will be in technical support charges, so essentially income in software will be<br>
equated with a tax on stupidity, which might not be a bad way to go, but I doubt that many<br>
investors will be that big on such a high risk concept, especially as such a market is self<br>
correcting....unless you purposely release bad software....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Moreover, service, or work, is the ultimate property right, unless you beleive in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; slavery. Only a slave does not have sole right to his or her own labor. An individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cannot have his or her work stolen from them. Intellectual property rights protect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; product of that work, whether it is a statue, a song, a building, a machine, or anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; else which is the result of man applying his or her intelligence to add value to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; something.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Go back and reread, and then consider my coercion point a little more</i><br>
<i>&gt; carefully.  Suppose there are no property rights, and I am deciding</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether or not I am going to invent.  I know that if I invent, many people</i><br>
<i>&gt; besides me will benefit.  Suppose that I decide to do so anyway, FULLY</i><br>
<i>&gt; AWARE of the fact that others will benefit.  Since this action is</i><br>
<i>&gt; voluntary, and not coerced, then the benefit which others would take from</i><br>
<i>&gt; my action as an externality is not stolen, but willingly given; if I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; unwilling to give it, then I would not have done so, and refused to</i><br>
<i>&gt; invent.</i><br>
<p>
So you admit that it is a severe disincentive against invention, if an inventor is guarranteed<br>
to have his invention stolen the minute it goes public. How many people will be able to devote<br>
their lives unselfishly to producing software when they have no hope of being compensated for<br>
the undertaking? Far Far fewer than those at present.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, this externality is still bad, because it means that I do not have</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough of an incentive to invent as I otherwise should.  I ACKOWLEDGED</i><br>
<i>&gt; that in my last post:  this was the "deadweight loss as inventors produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; fewer inventions than they otherwise would."  I argued that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; deadweight loss would be OUTWEIGHED by the economic efficiency gained from</i><br>
<i>&gt; not enforcing those rights.  Let's examine this more carefully.</i><br>
<p>
And I replied that I think that you are out of your hat to think so...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I understand your logic, and beleive that you are wrong in your economic evaluation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Without a protect of an inventors intellectual property rights, there will not be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same level of invention as there is when there are such protections. The human race is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; desperately dependent on advancing technology from invention that is stimulated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intellectual property rights incentives, only because we are stuck on one planet with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ever increasing population. Every increase demands greater efficiency of resource</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; utilization, something which can only happen with high levels of invention. You have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ignored the incentive effect that such protections have on technological development.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I did NOT ignore it; I specifically referred to it, and argued that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be outweighed by the deadweight loss due to monopoly plus the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; of enforcement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Exactly, which is why your concept cannot work and maintain a decent level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technological advancement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wrong.  The fact that transaction costs are not zero means that the system</i><br>
<i>&gt; of allocation of resources is inefficient; this is represented by</i><br>
<i>&gt; deadweight loss.  However, enforcing intellectual property is ALSO</i><br>
<i>&gt; inefficent, as it grants monopolies over copes of ideas, resulting in more</i><br>
<i>&gt; deadweight losses, as well as incurring the cost of enforcement.</i><br>
<p>
You have yet to quantify any of your claims, probably because you cannot quantify those<br>
claims.... come back when you get real data...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The question is not which system is inefficient and which is not; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; question is which is LEAST inefficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Intellectual property enforcement  costs are extremely low, because it is very easy for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the public to know when a product is a knock off or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If each buying person gains equal utility from a copy as they do from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original (an extremely likely presumption when we're talking about pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; information) then it becomes profitable to buy your goods from the black</i><br>
<i>&gt; market rather than from reputable dealers.  And if you think the black</i><br>
<i>&gt; market for information is easy to break, the software industry has NEWS</i><br>
<i>&gt; for you.</i><br>
<p>
I work in the software industry, and it is easy to create fingerprints in data and in software.<br>
The problem in the software industry is a refusal on the part of nations like china to enforce<br>
the laws they already have, because the pirates are top officials in the Communist Party.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even today, software copyrights simply aren't enforced on a wide scale; to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do so would require monitoring everyone's personal computers and</i><br>
<i>&gt; wire-tapping the whole Internet; it's completely impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt; discover/prevent if the pirates are using encryption for anonymity and</i><br>
<i>&gt; transmission.  You'd have to outlaw cryptography in order to even come</i><br>
<i>&gt; close to eliminating software piracy.</i><br>
<p>
its more a matter of prosecuting those in the breach. An easy way for, say, Microsoft to<br>
enforce its own copyright is to require that all resellers of Windows perform license checks on<br>
software on customers computers when the coputers are sent in for maintenance. I don't see any<br>
reason why Apple, Microsoft, and IBM don't get together and adopt that as an OS industry<br>
standard practice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Software piracy is probably the highest costing market upon which to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce intellectual property; music probably comes in a close second</i><br>
<i>&gt; (it's a black market which is unevenly enforced so you can't get official</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers for this sort of thing).  However, even if the cost due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement is lower for some goods than for others (your mailing list,</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps), you STILL have the problem of deadweight loss due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopolization of copies.  Basically, I'm covered by BOTH effects: the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost of enforcement AND monopolization.</i><br>
<p>
One interesting thing I've found is that the pirate market overseas is turned a blind eye by<br>
most software and music producers because its a neat way to get reduced prices from their CD<br>
manufacturers (and consequently lowered tariff costs) by cutting a deal with the chinese CD<br>
producer that allows him to produce X number of CDs on the side for his own resale on the<br>
'pirate' market. THis way, the music or software company can continue to make huge profits in<br>
markets where the CDs are sold at high retail rates, while minimizing their production and<br>
shipping costs. Its really just a tax dodge....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Granted they have gone up in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; recent years, but only because we have opened our economy wide to the Chinese, who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; no respect for intellectual property, nor any other type of property or individuality, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; seems. Rather than looking at pirating as a positive externality, look at the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enforcement as an externality created by pirates that everyone has to pay. If trade with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pirate economies were cut off, our cost of intellectual property enforcement would go</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; down again.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Your logic is dizzying: the more the positive externality happens, (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is, by definition,) the more we have to pay to stop it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; happening!  Of course, if we weren't trying to pay for IP's enforcement,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then we would circumvent that part of the problem entirely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You have to date, only guessed. Since the current situation is one where intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; property is respected and enforced, I think that the onus is on YOU to prove your point</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with real numbers. Until you do, all we can think of your ideas is that they are quaint</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fantasy with no basis in fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Guessing?  Only so as to provide extra precision.  If you'd like I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; stick to being very general, based on what we already know.  We already</i><br>
<i>&gt; know that the cost to an individual of producing another copy of a piece</i><br>
<i>&gt; of information is low, and that it does not increase significantly when</i><br>
<i>&gt; lots of people are producing lots and lots of copies.  Therefore, we know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the production of copies is nearly completely elastic.  (HOW near is</i><br>
<i>&gt; what I was trying to guess.)  Since the marginal revenue curve for</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopolies is half of the demand curve, we know that it will strike the</i><br>
<i>&gt; P=0 line at 0.5Q, where Q is the quantity demanded when P=0.  If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; marginal cost curve were completely elastic, then the market for copies</i><br>
<i>&gt; would shrink by 50% thanks to monopolization.  Again, since it is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearly completely elastic, deadweight loss is is only nearly 50%; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; guessed 40%, which gives me a large margin for error.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think that history shows that lack of intellectual property enforcement causes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invention to be severely undervalued. Looking at how national borders create natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; limitations on intellectual property rights, and how making such rights enforceable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; across borders via tools such as GATT it seems rather clear that prior to enforced</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intellectual property rights, invention was severly undervalued, and the rates of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; productivity growth suffered as a result. Today's startling increases in  productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; just a few years after GATT are proof that expanding the incentive to invent expands the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rate of invention and therefore the rate of productive growth</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, there's no question that the rate is affected. I agree: when the</i><br>
<i>&gt; incentive goes up, invention goes up, and when incentive goes down,</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention goes down.  That's not what I'm on about.  What I'm saying is</i><br>
<i>&gt; this:  we know both that the market for copies is slashed by at least 40%</i><br>
<i>&gt; when IP is enforced, and that the cost of enforcement is non-trivial.  Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopolization's deadweight loss plus the cost of enforcement GREATER than</i><br>
<i>&gt; or LESS than the deadweight loss due to decreased invention?  I say</i><br>
<i>&gt; greater; you know why.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Considering that you have refused to respond to my refutation of your assertion that an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invention is a monopoly, your argument does not stand. Any engineer will tell you that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there are always many many ways to solve a problem. Only problems are unique. Invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is not a monopoly market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We must assume that the engineer's ability to route aroun IP is not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant effect, otherwise IP has NO economic effect at all: whenever</i><br>
<i>&gt; you try to patent your idea, I invent another one just like it and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; gain nothing.  If this is true, then the only difference in costs between</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing IP and not enforcing IP is the cost of enforcement; and that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; in MY favor, not yours.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, if we assume that IP cannot be so easily routed around, as we</i><br>
<i>&gt; must if we think IP will have any effect, then we must observe that IP is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; by its very definition, granting the inventor monopoly rights over copies</i><br>
<i>&gt; of their idea.  This is how we define IP; there isn't any argument to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; made here.  And, since in this market copies are cheap and supply is</i><br>
<i>&gt; elastic, the market for copies suffers at least 40% losses thanks to</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopolization.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't need to. The present economy is my own proof. YOU need to come up with proof that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; economic growth would be higher without such protections. That the US has one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; highest levels of intellectual property protections, along with among the top 3 or 4 per</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capital incomes/standards of living, and among the highest economic and productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; growth rates for a nation at its state of development (a third world with a 50% growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rate doesn't mean anything if they are starting from nothing.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm making a MICROecnomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument.  As you</i><br>
<i>&gt; well know, there are hundreds of thousands of effects which have positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; and negative effects on the economy, many of which are present in the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; and not in other areas (or vice versa).  The only macroecnomic argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I can present is that microeconomic efficiency, as a trend, leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards greater GDP.  However, the behavior of one market can never be</i><br>
<i>&gt; used to predict the behavior of the economy as a whole.  Microeconomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; markets tend to clear and/or equilibrate; they have no business cycle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The macroeconomy is practically the antithesis of this model.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If I am right, then IP is just one of the galaxy of factors which hold</i><br>
<i>&gt; America back from greater growth, none of which alone could possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; explain our growth rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No, theft is when someone benefits from someone else without that persons permission or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; acquiescence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If there are no IP rights, and the inventor invents despite knowing this,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the inventor has, by necessity, acquiesced.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; To fail to protect the product of an individuals mind is to declare that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all minds are slaves to society, that the individual has no rights at all. That is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; collevtivist, subjectivist, post modern scam if ever I heard one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, how does this sound:  I declare that individuals have a right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their physical property and energy, and that anyone has the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; organize their property in any way they want, even if they organize their</i><br>
<i>&gt; property just like someone else's property.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't sound very collectivist to ME.</i><br>
<p>
How does someone else know exactly how someone else organize their property?? If they haven't<br>
paid for the product (i.e. the information about the other person) then they cannot organize<br>
their property the exact same way, can they?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Fails to maximize the utility of what or who?? Society? Sorry, society has no rights, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is not entitled to its own utility. Lack of intellectual property is enslavement of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mind to the collective. Bye Bye BORG.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What striking rhetoric.  No, not the utility of society, but of all of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals in society, in sum.</i><br>
<p>
Duh, in sum is society.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Just like how America's wealth is not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth owned by America, but the wealth owned by every individual in</i><br>
<i>&gt; America (and that's the way it should be!), I refer to net utility as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; utility possessed by every person in the nation.</i><br>
<p>
Destroying the incentive to invent destroys the utility of every thinking mind. Destroying the<br>
value of the thinking mind makes a human nothing but another animal that can be penned,<br>
harnessed, and slaughtered at will....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; See?  Not collectivist.</i><br>
<p>
Totally collectivist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hardly. As history has shown intellectual property works (American history). Lack thereof</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; does not work (most everywhere else's history)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whether IP works or doesn't work is the subject of debate; it cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrated by looking at GDP, as many nations which DO have IP are</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonetheless doing poorly macroeconomically; the behavior of one market</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not dictate the success of the whole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you utilitarian or libertarian. There is a distinct difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My ethical principles are utilitarian.  Because of that, I certify that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not believe in or advocate the initiation of force as a means of</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieving political or social goals.  You decide whether that makes me a</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You have yet to objectively and scientifically demonstrate that it is a bad law. The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dead weight here are those who steal the product of another's mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Monopolization objectively leads to deadweight loss.  I have argued that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the law is bad for this reason.  Now it's time for you to show how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; deadweight loss under my system is bigger than the deadweight loss under</i><br>
<i>&gt; your system as well plus the cost of enforcement.</i><br>
<p>
I don't need to. I have the present system as my proof. Since your system is the new one, you<br>
need to do the quantification comparing the two. Rough percentages and uninformed guesstimates<br>
do not cut it.<br>
