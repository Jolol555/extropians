<i>&gt;Actually, you can guide a lot with linear motors, without turning the</i><br>

<i>&gt;vacuum (hitting a wall of air at these velocities is a good method to</i><br>
<i>&gt;fashion abovementioned gelee, which then gets lyophilized in situ, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the turbovacs kick in -- yummy) requires active tunnel segments. Which </i><br>
<i>&gt;will need juice, and cost a bit. Of course with drextech you can do</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything, but simply sending information encoding the object </i><br>
<i>&gt;(or farcast your telepresence avatar via fibre or LEO routed </i><br>
<i>&gt;geodetic links) is way cheaper.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If nanotech develops as I envision it, there might be a factory in every<br>
home capable of producing things from raw materials on site. Purchases would<br>
than be of licenses to produce items. Transport would become superfluous in<br>
many cases.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Besides, but for athmosphere exit and reentry, the travel difference</i><br>
<i>&gt;between subterrestrial and LEO travel should be not that much to</i><br>
<i>&gt;require the hideously high costs of a subtersat. Also, the view out of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the window is prettier.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
One of the pluses of the suborbital is that the longest possible trip is<br>
well under an hour. Too short for boredome, and if it was true orbital, you<br>
get some time at zero gee..<br>
<p>
Also, there is no pollution involved as is the case in virtually every<br>
launch system I can think of. Even Liek Myrabo's Lightcraft will produce NOx<br>
from the superheated air that propels tham. Also, no launch system except a<br>
mass driver has the capability of recovering even a small percentage of<br>
launch energy.<br>
<p>
Then, there's the air drag losses inescapable with atmospheric travel for<br>
the launch/reentry.<br>
<p>
For the best efficiency, the evacuated tube reigns supreme, second only to<br>
travel in space. I think, however, we will see the use of suborbital rockets<br>
as transports MUCH sooner than underground sattelites!<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;On an unrelated tentacle, here is a monkey catapult idea. You probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;know that liquid CPR has arrived as an advanced ER technique. Well, if </i><br>
<i>&gt;floating in a container of saline with lungs full of oxygenated</i><br>
<i>&gt;fluorocarbon you can as well put you into a Luna-located</i><br>
<i>&gt;PV/capacitor-driven linear motor a few km long, while keeping the g's</i><br>
<i>&gt;well below monkey homogenization threshold.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Take a superconducting coil, and make sure it won't quench due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;launch forces, and mount it upon a composite (you'd have to shield the </i><br>
<i>&gt;human, though) containment with a (anaesthesized or VR-entertained) </i><br>
<i>&gt;monkey pickled in saline/fluorocarbon, add a fuel cell and some </i><br>
<i>&gt;controlling circuit and hurl the whole thing from the lunar linear</i><br>
<i>&gt;motor catapult. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course you must make sure an inverse thing catches you on the other </i><br>
<i>&gt;end, orelse this is just an expensive means of having you making a</i><br>
<i>&gt;GIANT impact upon poor unsuspecting target, and you probably won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;like the saline that much (you can remove the lung flooding while </i><br>
<i>&gt;in transit), though one can think about protective membranes, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;additives to saline. One will want to minimize the mass, though, which </i><br>
<i>&gt;limits the comfort, and flight duration. (Of course you can think</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanorecycling/pocket microecology and nuclear power if the PV array</i><br>
<i>&gt;unfolded in transit doesn't suffice in the outskirts of the Solar</i><br>
<i>&gt;system, etc, but then it is slowly turning ridiculous).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If it weren't for having to voluntarily drown oneself (painful without<br>
augments to prevent the gag reflex), this would be a damn popular thrill ride..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And of course it will be nothing like StarTrek, and this is why people </i><br>
<i>&gt;will hate it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;ciao,</i><br>
<i>&gt;'gene</i><br>
<p>
My feeling is that the Star Trek transporter or anything even remotely<br>
similar will turn out to be quite unworkable. Think of the bandwidth<br>
requirements for transmission and the precision required for the encoder and<br>
decoder/reassembler! Damn shame. Also, too many people have seen 'The Fly'...<br>
