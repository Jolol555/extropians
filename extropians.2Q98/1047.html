How does that follow? Just because something has not been done, that makes<br>
no prediction on its' future possibility. Arguments like this predicted that<br>
Man could never fly..<br>
<p>
Besides, is it not conceivable that WE would be the first? Someone's got to<br>
take the lead..<br>

<p>
It could be a matter of HOW godlike these hypothetical beings were. They<br>
might decide to remain local to their own area of the universe or galaxy, or<br>
just act as passive observers until another race attained sufficient<br>
godliness to be of notice.. Godlike does not presuppose they want to act<br>
like Old Testament Jehovah...<br>
<p>
And then there's always the possibility that they ARE meddling in our<br>
affairs RIGHT NOW...<br>
