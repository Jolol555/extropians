<i>&gt;How can CNET be that sloppy with their research?  They specifically</i><br>
<i>&gt;mention the "myth" that VCRs and coffee-makers won't work after the year</i><br>
<i>&gt;2000.  Then they dismiss this by claiming that home appliances don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;care what year it is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is false for some brands.  My VCR is set to record daily programs</i><br>
<i>&gt;Monday through Friday.  When I try to put in the year "00" (it only</i><br>
<i>&gt;allows two spaces), it says year 1900 and then records the wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;programs on the wrong day of the week.  I cannot program dates past the</i><br>
<i>&gt;year 2000.  I cannot use day-of-the-week codes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My coffee maker is also set to make coffee automatically Monday through</i><br>
<i>&gt;Friday.  I haven't tested it, but if it misinterprets the year, it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be making coffee on the weekends and skipping coffee two week days a</i><br>
<i>&gt;week.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
A rule of thumb here. If the device in question responds to leap years, you<br>
probably should be concerned. If there is a way to enter date information,<br>
ditto. Most appliances with clocks don't even have date capability.<br>
<p>
I program oven controls used in major brands, among other things, and most<br>
of these gadgets are barely good enough to keep up with 24 straight hours,<br>
let alone years. Unless there's a good reason for a date function, such as<br>
in a VCR, there probably won't be trouble.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What bothers me is that CNET didn't say most of these devices will</i><br>
<i>&gt;correctly calculate the year and will function correctly. CNET said that</i><br>
<i>&gt;these devices don't care what the year is.  This is demonstrably false. </i><br>
<i>&gt;I must question whether they really researched VCR's and Coffeemakers to</i><br>
<i>&gt;see how they would function when the dates were set ahead.  Their</i><br>
<i>&gt;explanation for why it doesn't matter is obviously false.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
They probably talked to someone like me and were told similar to what I just<br>
related, them clipped the explanation down to 'sound bite' size. Most news<br>
reporters are trained to write to the lowest common denominator of the<br>
audience. This is somewhere around third grade level.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The very fact that they asked different "experts" instead of simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;programming a VCR or coffeemaker to see for themselves shows the lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt;real research going into this article.  People interested in this and</i><br>
<i>&gt;other computer bugs should read the "comp.risks" newsgroup.  It is full</i><br>
<i>&gt;of technical explanation for how computers fail.  Computers fail much</i><br>
<i>&gt;more easily than people think.  In most cases, it is false human</i><br>
<i>&gt;expectations about the computer that causes the problem.  If this stuff</i><br>
<i>&gt;interests you, or you want to hear from people who really research</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer bugs, definitely read "comp.risks"!</i><br>
<p>
These same 'experts' are the ones now peddling Y2K snake oil on the<br>
Internet. Some will get rich...<br>
<p>
The mindset most people seem to have about computers is that they have much<br>
more 'intellect' than they actually do. In the case of MS Windows, I have to<br>
agree - and it's an EVIL intellect..<br>
