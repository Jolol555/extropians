  IAN: If the only other thing is B,<br>
  A increased in size relative to B<br>
  in the fashion described above. The <br>
  simple fact that B appears to be <br>
  smaller than A means that A appears <br>
  to be larger than B to observer A.<br>
<p>
  Has A gotten larger than B? The only <br>
  way for A to know is look at B. If B <br>
  is smaller, then A has gotten larger.<br>
<p>
  The fact that both observers witness<br>
  the same thing does not break this <br>
  symmetry of relational structure.<br>
  Both observers see themselves <br>
  as larger than the other:<br>
<p>
	  A  B   (how I appeared)<br>
	A 0  +<br>
	B +  0<br>
<p>
   and both observed the other as smaller:<br>
<p>
	  B  A   (how the other appeared)<br>
	B 0  -<br>
	A -  0<br>
<p>
  and the sum of all valid measurements equals 0.<br>
  Nice try Dan, but time to find another counter,<br>
  I've already toppled this one three times now.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;There is not point where A increases relative to B, and THAT'S the truth.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Sorry, but that's just false and<br>
  I've already proved that it's false.<br>
<p>
  If the size of A = 1 and the size of A<br>
  = the size of B, but then B decreases<br>
  in size to .5, it is a fact that 1 is<br>
  LARGER than .5, and thus A has gotten<br>
  larger relative to B because B got <br>
  smaller relative to A. Simple.<br>
<p>
  Because B was also size 1, it could <br>
  be stated now that A = 1.5, for no<br>
  point of size-reference is absolute.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; That the second matrix is valid is clearly </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; proven by the fact that -1 is less than </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 0 and 0 is 1 more than -1. If we have 2</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; things in the universe, A and B, and B </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gets smaller, it's equally true that A</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gets larger, because size is relative.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, you don't understand. You're thinking in terms of Newtonian physics</i><br>
<i>&gt;and not in the inherently non-intuitive terms of special relativity. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Normally, when something gets smaller, something else gets larger relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;to it; special relativity sys that when B appears smaller to A, A appears</i><br>
<i>&gt;SMALLER to B, not larger. This is why it doesn't sum to 0: If B were</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually shrinking, it would look like this: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A B</i><br>
<i>&gt;A 0 -C</i><br>
<i>&gt;B +C 0</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: There is no absolute size, you cannot have <br>
  "got smaller" free from "got larger." Observer <br>
  A will measure the situation and see that there <br>
  are two sides of the relative change: he himself <br>
  got larger than B because B got smaller than A.<br>
<p>
  Your case represents the fallacy of atomism, <br>
  that we can have S (smaller) free from not-S.<br>
