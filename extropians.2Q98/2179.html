Er, by this do you mean that you think that truth and falsehood CAN be<br>
collapsed in this way?  I had meant it as a reductio ad absurdum.<br>

I presume you are referring to the notion that the photon can "pass<br>
through the left slot" and not "pass through the left slot" at the same<br>
time.  In this case, I want to assert again that this question is<br>
gibberish from the perspective of quantum physics.  That it disagrees with<br>
the macro world as described by Newton is isn't really relevant to this<br>
point.<br>
