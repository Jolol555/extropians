<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As I've shown many times, the definition of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; "A=A" is the crackpot fallacy of Circular Definition:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anton Sherwood (dasher@netcom.com)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If a definition is fallacious for including a paraphrase of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the word defined, then *all* definitions are fallacious. And</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;yet they're still useful.</i><br>

<i>&gt;   that are different than it. The "A=A"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   definition of A does not do that, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;   seeks to remove A from context,</i><br>
<p>
Beep!  "A=A" is not a definition of A; it is a definition of "=" (as I<br>
believe I have pointed out before).<br>
The context of the definition is the field of mathematical logic.<br>
The definition "A=A" defines equality as different from inequality<br>
(which yours, by the way, fails to do).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   and thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;   seeks to nullify its identity</i><br>
<p>
Nullify the identity of identity?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   to the ex-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tent its identity is derived from differ-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ential relation, which it is by 100%.</i><br>
<p>
(Token objection to misuse of the word.  See elsewhere for details.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   We can go around and around about identity,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   but the shortcut is to simply show me the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   proof, show me A that is A free from not-A.</i><br>
<p>
Where have I asserted that A is free from not-A?  Please quote me.  <br>
I don't even know what "free" means here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   That's all you need to do. You don't need</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to call me names or get mad, just prove it.</i><br>
<p>
I was not angry when I jocularly used the word "crackpot".  <br>
I only become angry when I read your tirades against everyone who uses<br>
the word _identity_ in its etymological sense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   I've tired to and having failed to do so,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   accepted that the identity of A is not the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "same as" A, but rather, A is the difference</i><br>
<i>&gt;   between A and not-A, and I didn't get upset.</i><br>
<p>
That's funny -- just a moment ago I responded to a post, apparently from<br>
you, that said <br>
<p>
	IAN: Identity is what a thing is; wether rock,<br>
	symbol, or idea, all things have an identity.<br>
<p>
Do please make up your mind.<br>
<p>
I remind you that I also do not say "the identity of A is the same as<br>
A".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   You've tried to do that, and like my own</i><br>
<i>&gt;   effort, your examples of "free identities"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   have only evidenced examples of holistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;   identities.</i><br>
<p>
I posted examples (adding to yours) of multiple perceptions.  After ten<br>
days of happy distractions, I've forgotten just what my purpose was, but<br>
I can't believe I intended them as examples of "free identities".  They<br>
couldn't be: because _identity_, as I am using the term, has no plural!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   If you cannot find any example</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of any identity or any attribute of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;   identity that is not derived from differ-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ential relation but from "same-as relation,"</i><br>
<p>
Identity *is* the "same-as relation".  Every example of identity is of<br>
the form "A=A".  The attributes of identity include symmetry,<br>
reflexivity, transitivity.  (Others, anybody?)<br>
<p>
The attributes of a *thing* are not identity.  They are very useful<br>
information, but they are not identity (Latin for "sameness").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   then you must admit that the "same-as"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   definition of identity is false, irra-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tional, and thus definitionally crackpot.</i><br>
<p>
Do you mind if, for the sake of my blood pressure, I replace all your<br>
uses of the word "identity" with "plergb"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   A is A not because A is the same as A,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A is A because A is different than not-A.</i><br>
<p>
A is A whether or not A is different from not-A.<br>
A is A whether or not there is another thing like A.<br>
A is A whether or not there is another thing unlike A.<br>
Exceptions eternally? Absolute none!<br>
<p>
I don't care *why* A is A.  *Why* is not part of the definition of<br>
identity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   We've been through this in the past, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;   never found a single example to support the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   atomist-identity theory you believe then and</i><br>
<i>&gt;   you still cannot find even one example now</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and yet here you are still clinging to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   How is it that some people can believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt;   that for which there is 100% no evidence?</i><br>
<p>
We don't need no stinkin' evidence to define a logical construct.  The<br>
guys who defined ASCII did not need evidence to assign the bitstring<br>
"1101001" to the letter "i".  That bitstring represents that letter<br>
because some engineers chose to make it so, and _identity_ means<br>
"sameness, the relation of a thing with itself" because someone coined<br>
the word and chose to use it in that sense.<br>
