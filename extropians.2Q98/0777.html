<p>
And I suffer from having had to pay you for it.  However, we wouldn't have<br>
agreed to exchange unless it allowed us to benefit more than we suffer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's not a choice between the work being done or not being done, it's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;question of HOW.  Under the current system, you pay a laborer to do it.</i><br>
Under<br>
<i>&gt;the future system, you can lease a robot to do it.  You are paying for the</i><br>

someone<br>
<i>&gt;to toil for you.  In the second case you're paying someone for the use of his</i><br>
<i>&gt;capital (in the form of the robot).</i><br>
<p>
Unless, of course, the robots are sentient, in which case you still pay a<br>
laborer to toil for you, only this laborer happens to be made out of<br>
diamondoid polymers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I prefer the second system, since it becomes less likely that I'll have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;work for a living.  It is an opportunity to lift the burden of work from</i><br>
<i>&gt;humanity, by making us all cyber-capitalists!</i><br>
<p>
The burden of work could only be lifted if supply increased so fast that it<br>
outstripped the demand for labor.  Now, while this might happen in the food<br>
market, particularly if an increasing percentage of our population doesn't<br>
need food, there's no evidence that the demand for labor will ever stop<br>
increasing.  People just seem to want more and more stuff, particularly<br>
since our population is growing, and would grow even faster if we had robot<br>
citizens.  Sentient robots would create jobs by stimulating demand,<br>
probably at least as much as they would fill jobs to participate in the<br>
economy.<br>
<p>
In other words, there may indeed come a time when you won't have to work<br>
(much?) in order to get food, housing and medicine.  However, there will<br>
also be so much more stuff available and at such convenient prices, that<br>
you'll probably want to work, and you'll want to buy what your fellow<br>
citizens are offering; even if those citizens are robots.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course there is some precedent in history...  There was the unfortunate</i><br>
<i>&gt;practice of human slavery.  I live in Texas, a state with the dubious</i><br>
<i>&gt;distinction of having gone to war /twice/ in defense of slavery.  This leads</i><br>
<i>&gt;to a certain degree of soul-searching.  If we ever attempt an economic system</i><br>
<i>&gt;using robots in the place of slaves, we must be /damn/ sure of our ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;grounds before starting.  There must be a system in place to ensure that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;robots -- no matter how versatile and competent they might become -- are</i><br>
<i>&gt;always in FACT soulless and emotionless automatons incapable of either</i><br>
<i>&gt;desiring or appreciating freedom.</i><br>
<p>
If I had to choose (from an economic standpoint) between creating mindless<br>
robot slaves or sentient robot employees, I would choose the sentient<br>
robots hands down.  A sentient robot could participate in the economy,<br>
performing labor and buying goods, creating jobs and filling them, making<br>
everyone better off in the process.  We would have just as much to gain<br>
from a sentient robot as we would from a slave, if not exponentially more.<br>
<p>
Also, if you consider utility a form of wealth, as I do, then we can<br>
immediately see that a sentient robot would be able to create many kinds of<br>
wealth which a mindless slave could not; art, for example.  Empathy.  Love.<br>
 Many of the forms of wealth which we consider "non-material" could be<br>
offered by robots...  Though they'd presumably want someone to love them in<br>
return.<br>
<p>
And I'll be the first to agree that that's a good thing.<br>
