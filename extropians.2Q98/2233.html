<i>&gt; whatsoever?</i><br>

The only problem is that you have identified the participants by their<br>
names.  But if they are anonymous to each other, they don't know each<br>
other's names.  So neither one can learn the anonymous mailbox of the<br>
other from his name.<br>
<p>
What I gather you mean is that there are two anonymous parties, both<br>
communicating in some kind of electronic forum, and over time they<br>
decide they want to communicate with each other.  Perhaps they notice<br>
that both have a shared interest in explosives and beautiful women.<br>
So they proceed to send email, and perhaps proceed to discuss subversive<br>
plans.<br>
<p>
This is no different than any other kind of on-line meeting, except that<br>
the two parties are anonymous.  In this scenario, you're right that if<br>
one is captured, he can't reveal the identity of the other.<br>
<p>
However, there are some problems.  With only online communication, you<br>
can't be quite as sure of the sincerity of your correspondent as you would<br>
be if you met face to face.  If your conversation progresses to the point<br>
where a meeting is necessary, that will be risky.<br>
<p>
Also, with anonymous communication it may not be possible to get the<br>
public keys meaningfully certified by third parties.  So a "man in the<br>
middle" attack may be more practical with this kind of communication.<br>
