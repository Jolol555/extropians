Whenever I'm trying to think through a complex matter, it helps me to<br>
return to the earliest source materials, return to the roots, and<br>
work my way forward.  I hereby offer FM-2030's original statements on<br>
transhumanity, from which you can easily see that we have moved away <br>
from the original definition and are struggling to articulate a new <br>
personal self-identification and framework of thought:  <br>
<p>
*****<br>
Transhumans (trans) are a new kind of being crystallizing from the <br>
monumental breakthroughs of the late 20th century.  Trans are not <br>
necessarily the progressives and Up-Wingers defined through this <br>
tract.  In other words, trans are not necessarily those whose values <br>
and lifestyles and environments are the most modern.<br>
<p>
Trans are not simply advanced historical people.  They are the <br>
earliest manifestations of new evolutionary beings.  Trans are like <br>
those earliest hominids who many millions of years ago came down from <br>
the trees and began to look around.  Transhumans are not necessarily <br>
committed to accelerating the evolution to higher life forms.  Many <br>
of them are not even aware of their bridging role in evolution.<br>
<p>
Trans can no longer be considered specifically human because the <br>
promises of biological terrestial life that have always defined the <br>
human no longer fully apply.  Many of the breakthroughs embodied in <br>
transhumans are nothing less than the beginnings of the eventual <br>
transformation of the human species.  If you score higher than 7 on <br>
Monitor 25 you are a rare being--an advanced forerunner of the <br>
posthumans who will surely evolve later in the 21st century.  (From:  _Are You <br>
Transhuman?_1989)<br>
<p>
The Questions:<br>
1.	Do you have a high-tech body?  In other words, does your body <br>
comprise any implants--transplants--smart limbs--electronic monitors, <br>
etc.?<br>
2.	Does your brain contain a pacemaker--electrodes--other <br>
peripherals?<br>
3.  	Have you undergone major body reconstruction?  <br>
4.	Are your body processes such as moods--cycles--body temperature, <br>
etc.--continuously telemonitored and regulated?<br>
5.	Are you connected to people and services via onbody (portable) <br>
telecom?<br>
6.	Are you androgynous?<br>
7.	Do you contribute to reproduction only through new collaborative <br>
asexual methods?  For example:  (a) Have you ever donated your sex <br>
cells for screening and possible fertilization?  (b) Have you ever <br>
acted as 'surrogate mother'?<br>
8.	Are you a product of artificial insemination or inovulation--in <br>
vitro fertilization--telegenesis--frozen embryo implant?<br>
9.	Are you postterritorial:  free of kinship <br>
ties--ethnicity--nationality?<br>
10.	Have you ever been outside this planet on space missions?<br>
11.	Have you ever died and been rescusitated?<br>
<p>
****<br>
We can never again be even content with civil rights, human rights, <br>
the right to self-determination.  These rights by themselves are also <br>
no longer enough.  We now want cosmic rights.  We want the freedom to <br>
roam the universe.  We want nothing less than the right to determine <br>
our own evolution.  We want the right to live forever -- to succeed <br>
with our revolution against death itself.  So long as we have not <br>
overthrown the tyranny of death, _all_ mankind belongs to the Third <br>
World, _all_ mankind is proletarian.  (From:  _Optimism One_)<br>
