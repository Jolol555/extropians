AS&gt; Why do we have pets? I think it is because we want companionship, but<br>
AS&gt; not necessarily with the demands of other humans and quite often<br>
AS&gt; because we enjoy companionship with a *different* kind of being. <br>
<p>
Very often the psychology is that of a parent-child relationship.  This is<br>
true not only for the human owners, but also possibly for the pets.  For<br>
example, if you watch the behavior of cats, much of it is based on their<br>
perception of humans as mother cats.  That's not surprising.  If you're a cat,<br>
mother is the one who feeds, cleans, and protects you.  So, your human owner<br>
fits that definition pretty closely.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; So I wouldn't be surprised if we in the future keep semi- or fully<br>
AS&gt; intelligent pets. They might have rights on their own; we already give<br>
AS&gt; animal rights,<br>
<p>
Speak for yourself!  I don't acknowledge any rights of animals, and AFIAK the<br>
law here in Texas doesn't either.  Neither does most of society, I believe,<br>
except for the few animal-rights extremists.<br>
<p>
Animals, like most things, have the value that people assign to them.  My pet<br>
cat is beloved to me; I would be hurt deeply if anything happened to him.  But<br>
a scraggly feral cat prowling around my back yard at night has no value to me;<br>
I would shoot one without even blinking.  I don't think there's anything<br>
abnormal about that.  It's human nature.<br>
<p>
This reminds me of the abortion debate.  When does a fetus become a person? <br>
My answer is that it happens whenever people -- mostly the parents, but also<br>
possibly others -- have invested enough physical and emotional resources in it<br>
to /care/ about it as a person.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; and one could imagine a canine union acting as the lobby for<br>
AS&gt; intelligent dogs (demands for fair treatment,<br>
<p>
That sounds like a particularly amusing vision of Hell.<br>
<p>
I'm opposed to the whole idea of animal rights for exactly this reason -- it<br>
sets a bad precedent for the future.  If you recognize animal rights, what's<br>
next?  It all comes down to economics.  See if you can follow my reasoning<br>
here...<br>
<p>
You could recognize rights of robots, if they meet some certain level of AI. <br>
At some point you would have to call it "sentient" and recognize it as a<br>
person instead of a mere machine.<br>
<p>
THEN it might be considered improper to own them.  That would be slavery. <br>
They would have to be set free and be paid for their work.  (Why do you call<br>
them FREE if you have to PAY them?  No, don't answer that!)  Under these<br>
circumstances, the robots change from being *servants* of humanity to being<br>
competitors.  Instead of finally lifting the burden of WORK from our<br>
civilization, the robots would simply take our jobs and leave us with nothing.<br>
<p>
There are four basic economic resources: land, labor, capital, and<br>
entrepreneurial ability.  I see the coming era as a change from a<br>
labor-oriented economy to a capital-oriented economy.  This change has already<br>
started, it happens whenever workers are replaced by machines.  The ultimate<br>
goal should be for *all* workers to be replaced by machines, and all the<br>
former workers become capitalists -- owners of the machines.  But if we grant<br>
that sufficiently advanced machines might also be /people/, then it throws a<br>
monkeywrench into the whole plan.<br>
<p>
It may seem I've rambled a long way from the subject of pets, but this is all<br>
inter-connected.  The same technology that will blur the distinction between<br>
labor and capital will also blur the distinction between machines and living<br>
creatures.  It's hard to say that life is sacred unless you can define life. <br>
Likewise, it's hard to say sentience is sacred unless you can define<br>
sentience.  I haven't yet heard a convincing definition of either, and this<br>
may lead to many conflicts.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; These pets do not need to be just animals or improved<br>
AS&gt; animals, they might be AIs or biotechnological constructs.<br>
<p>
There, you see?  Exactly what I was saying...<br>
<p>
AS&gt; Overall, I think uplifting of other species is a good idea, but the<br>
AS&gt; ethics is quite complicated.<br>
<p>
I don't see anything to gain by it.  In a way, animals are too much like us. <br>
Although not as intelligent, they share the same basic drives we do,<br>
programmed by eons of survival and reproduction.  That means ultimately they<br>
will probably WANT the same things we do.  Biology is destiny.  Even if you<br>
shed the biology, its legacy remains.  So, I am more interested in creating<br>
entirely artificial creatures that can be programmed from the ground up. <br>
Without an evolutionary legacy, they can be given /drives/ that are completely<br>
unlike natural life forms: innate compulsions to do things that are useful to<br>
US.<br>
