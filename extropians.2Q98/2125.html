11. AN ANALYSIS OF DEMOGRAPHIC TRAJECTORIES OF HUMAN LONGEVITY <br>
Human old-age survival has increased substantially since 1950, <br>
and this evidence of extended post-reproductive survival is <br>
apparently puzzling biodemographers. Vaupel et al (14 authors at <br>
10 installations, DE US DK MX CN) review current questions and <br>
results in this field, presenting data from various sources. The <br>
reduction in death rates at older ages has increased the size of <br>
the elderly population considerably. In developed countries in <br>
1990 there were about twice as many nonagenarians and 4 to 5 <br>
times as many centenarians as there would have been if mortality <br>
after age 80 had stayed at 1960 levels. Reliable data for various <br>
developed countries indicate that the population of centenarians <br>
has doubled every decade since 1960, mostly as a result of <br>
increases in survival after age 80. Here are selected data for <br>
people 60 years and older in 1997 and projections for 2025: <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
1997 2025 percent of pop. in 2025 <br>
