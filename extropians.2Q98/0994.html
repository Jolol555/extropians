<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I discuss this problem in THE SPIKE, and suggest that we might take another</i><br>
<i>&gt;look at Robert Theobald's 1960s' discussion (recently revived) for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;minimum Guaranteed Income.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;As an inviolable constitutional entitlement, a guaranteed income would</i><br>
<i>&gt;offer people who'd been made technologically redundant the chance to engage</i><br>
<i>&gt;in dignified self-help.  ...</i><br>
<p>
There is no such thing as an inviolable consitutional entitlement.  A disruptive<br>
transition may also disrupt the governments you expect to maintain this program,<br>
and the public good will that is essential to continuing it.  <br>
<p>
If the purpose is to insure people against risks from who will benefit from <br>
a disruptive transition, why not just have people buy private insurance now?<br>
And why not work to get government out of the way of such private insurance?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Theobald was more optimistic still.  Productive groups, which he termed</i><br>
<i>&gt;`consentives', would come together on a voluntary basis, working simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;because they wanted to.  ...  Since wages and</i><br>
<i>&gt;salaries would be irrelevant, cost of goods would be minimal, hardly</i><br>
<i>&gt;greater than raw materials and transport - comparable with computerised</i><br>
<i>&gt;factory production.  </i><br>
<p>
But aren't you going to have to put huge taxes on those goods to finance<br>
this minimum income?  The income has to come from somewhere you know.<br>
<p>
Economist have a lot to say about variations on minimum income schemes,<br>
and I really think you'd benefit from reading more of that literature.<br>
