 This is NOT radical right-wing paranoia. Most of the elements of the new<br>
 proposed national ID system are already in place NOW. The next step is for<br>
 all information to be coordinated and completely accessible to any and all<br>
 bureaucrats for their arbitrary and capricious abuse.<br>
 <br>
 The national ID card itself (which you will be required to carry) will have<br>
 a magnetic strip (or chip) which is imbedded in it. That means YOU (when you<br>
 have your mandated national ID card on your person) could be tracked<br>
 wherever you go. Privacy will be an anachronism.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Other cards that have magnetic strips: credit cards, ATM cards, hotel keys,<br>
appt keys, et al.  The magnetic strips can't be used to somehow follow your<br>
movements.  But the author of the article seems more interested in propogating<br>
a juvenile kind of paranoia than paying much attention to the benefits of such<br>
a system or to the fact that the system really doesn't add any new powers to<br>
the government but only makes the government more efficient.  In any immensely<br>
large and complex society such as ours a standardized identification system<br>
makes perfect sense.  And the presence of it simply has nothing to do with<br>
government encroachment of anyone's rights.  It DOES have to do with making<br>
the government more efficient.  The place to protect rights, however, is in<br>
the courts and the legislatures, and NOT upon the assumption of governmental<br>
inefficiency in enforcing its laws.<br>
