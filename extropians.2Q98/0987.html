No sane economist would argue that there are absolutely no natural<br>
monopolies.  However, there are also limits as to what a natural monopoly<br>
can do to its customers.  For example, if it jacks up the prices too high,<br>
it will become more profitable to compete with it.  If the product is<br>
shitty, then competitors have a profit window.  Whenever a monopoly tries<br>
to abuse its power, it risks loosening its grasp on its industry.  So there<br>
are some limits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;KG&gt; But, in fact, no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;KG&gt; established by means of free trade on a free market.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, there's a great body of evidence that (at least at the time of<br>
the study) electricity was a natural monopoly.  So, to be fair, the<br>
government took over.  &lt;throws his hands in the air&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And if anyone finds an example -- such as Microsoft -- then we'll ignore it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;since it does't fit into our theory.  Although to be fair, Microsoft's</i><br>
<i>&gt;monopoly *is* enforced by the power of the US Government, in the form of many</i><br>
<i>&gt;copyrights and software patents.  Just imagine how quickly Microsoft would</i><br>
<i>&gt;crack down in the courts on any company that produced a MS-Windows compatible</i><br>
<i>&gt;OS!</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  Imagine how cool Windows would be if it had open source.  :)<br>
Copyright is synonymous with government enforced monopoly in an information<br>
market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Many people in the industry are not afraid to admit publicly that this</i><br>
scam is<br>
<i>&gt;taking place.  Why should they care if people know?  It's not like there's</i><br>
any<br>
<i>&gt;other viable platform that people can turn to.  Oh, there's Macintosh, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;guess, but Mr. Gates now has a finger in that pie too.</i><br>
<p>
The problem being that we seem to reap such benefits from copyright, that<br>
it's hard to come to the conclusion that we should ditch the idea<br>
altogether.  Not to mention the fact that you've got at least three or four<br>
large and incredibly rich industries which would be levelled if we<br>
eliminated intellectual property:  Hollywood, books, software...  I think<br>
there's at least one more, but it's not coming to me this instant...  <br>
<p>
Ah, well.  At any rate, Microsoft IS receiving government protection, and<br>
it couldn't exist without it.  So at least in this example, the free market<br>
is cleared.<br>
