True, but if "blue" is strictly defined (which is the sort of thing you<br>
can do when you're talking about meta languages) then the sky TRULY is or<br>
isn't blue.  That it becomes black at night doesn't negate the proof; even<br>
then, it truly is or isn't black.<br>
<p>
How to identify the truth is a separate point which I don't think Tarski<br>
answers; he merely shows that there IS truth.  (An important<br>
accomplishment, especially in the face of certain sollipsists who assert<br>
that the truth is whatever we think it is.)<br>
