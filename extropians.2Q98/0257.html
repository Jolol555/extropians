If we were not unhappy, there would be zero impetus to change. No impetus<br>
to change in an coevolutionary context guarantees failure before long.<br>
Hence this is no surprise that the majority of us is not happy. I am<br>
pretty happy to be unhappy, actually. Saves one from being an<br>
beautifically smiling evolutionary cul de sac. <br>

One is thought not to think in patterns like that. Meme police will get<br>

Hardly. The domain of mechanosynthesis being (cryogenic) UHV conditions<br>
limits action in heavily solvated systems to rearranging premade molecules<br>
by comparatively large (low concentration of manglers in a sea of<br>
manglees), artefacting devices in an unarrested environment. In contrast<br>
to in vivo, you can do a lot with vitrified biological systems. You could<br>
probably even build a (smallish) critter in vitrified stage and<br>
flash-devitrify it into life, retracting the nanofilament scaffolding<br>
after the fact. <br>

Xactly.<br>
 <br>

<p>
Unless we can get out of the Darwin box, which is probably impossible, you<br>
can't remain in the state of eternal bliss. We can homeostate us to max<br>
out the kick we get from being a rat the rat race, though. <br>
