<i>&gt; scratch and didn't incorporate IP owned by the Big Boys.  But the PRICE of</i><br>
<i>&gt; desktop-manufactured computers would definitely drop drastically, with many</i><br>
<i>&gt; concomitant effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I begin to see where we differ. Basically, nanotech may be usable in any of several<br>
ways to build computers. I was thinking in terms of rod logic, because IMO<br>
there are no "hard" problems to solve to get to rod logic, other than getting<br>
to nanotech itself. In addition, any competent engineer should be able to<br>
generate a set of basic building blocks: gates, flip-flops, etc. that can<br>
form the basis of a computer design. Now a slight diversion. microprocessor<br>
design involves a hierarchy of design levels. The most abstract level is<br>
the "logical architecture", or "programmer's model" of the sysstem. below this<br>
are levels like RTL and functional descriptions which can be expressed in<br>
labguages like VHDL. Below this, you get to levels that become increasingly<br>
sensistive to the actual physical and electronic properties of the transistors,<br>
other components, and interconnections on the chip itself. The vast majority of<br>
Intel's IP involves these lower layers. Indeed, there are computer archtiectures<br>
(such as MIPS) whose upper layers are in the public domain. Therefore, I feel that<br>
the playing field may be very level here, and Intel's only remaining advantage is<br>
a collection of employees who can rapidly retrain from a microlithographical<br>
orientation to a nanotech orientation. Most of their IP will be worthless.<br>
Basically, the first generation of nanotech supercomputers will not need<br>
the nanotech equivalent of sophisitcated routing tools. We can generate logic<br>
blocks that are easy to design and easy to interconnect, without worrying about<br>
efficient packing or band gap or even heat and power. The first generation can<br>
accept huge inefficiences in power and volume and still be thousands to tens<br>
of thousands of times smaller than silicon-based computers. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  I also believe that there is at least a chance that the availability of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  nanotech-built massively parallel supercomputers will enable a path to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  AI, which in turn could permit a nanotech control system that can enable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  us to build complicated stuff. You appear to think this unlikely?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not necessarily unlikely, but definitely not certain.  I agree that it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; make HARDWARE cheap and progress in hardware very fast.  However, I don't see</i><br>
<i>&gt; the necessary link to the development of SOFTWARE.  That's where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagreement is, I think.</i><br>
<p>
This is beginning to look like an agreement to me. Neither of us either<br>
rejects or predicts that nano-based supercomputing must lead to AI. In this,<br>
I defer to Hans Moravic, who more-or-less believes that progress in AI<br>
directly correlates to the amount of computing power controlled by the<br>
average AI researcher. My point was that hardware does not by itself<br>
create AI software, but there are some brute-force approaches that may<br>
become feasible with truly massive supercomputing. Of sourse, AI (or<br>
my favorite, the collaborative SI) are grand general solutions to<br>
the software problem: just create a superprogrammer. This is not the<br>
only way to use truly massive computing to solve programming problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  We also disagree on the rate of adoption of even the "simple stuff"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  technology. I feel that the rate will be very rapid, while you think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  it will take a decade. In essence, I feel that after the time that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  first macro-scale part (brick, tennis racket handle, whatever) there will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  be no new orders for new non-nanotech capital equipment, and within a year</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  most simple hard-good parts will be diamondoid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I strongly disagree.  Existing capital equipment won't disappear.  To a great</i><br>
<i>&gt; extent, the existing physical plant at the time of "simple stuff nanotech"</i><br>
<i>&gt; represents sunk costs.  Owners of those goods will continue to use them, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a developing competitive disadvantage.  It won't make sense to replace the</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire manufacturing plant of the earth in a year.  Capital equipment life</i><br>
<i>&gt; cycles WILL shorten and the old tools will be replaced with much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient ones more quickly than they otherwise would have, due to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; financial incentive to "get with the program", but the old technology will</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue to be a drag for ten years, although less so toward the end,</i><br>
<i>&gt; obviously.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Again, we are pretty close. Note that I said no new orders for non-nanotech<br>
capital equipment. I understand that existing capital equipent will continue<br>
to operate until replaced. Essentially, the only constraint on this process<br>
will be the design time for the replacement equipment.<br>
