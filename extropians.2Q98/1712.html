Apology accepted.<br>
<p>
I don't mean to jump on your case specifically.  Its just that this thread has<br>
generated a lot of 'reactionary' and knee-jerk reactions of people who haven't<br>
bother reading what I wrote, and then presuming that I am so kind of dogged<br>
socialist proposing a centralized governmental body to re-distribute the wealth.<br>
This is simply not the case.<br>
<p>
The problem I'm trying to reconcile is the elegance of the free market combined<br>
with increasing automation.  Obviously, once we reach the assembler breakthrough<br>
this whole issue becomes moot. Money and work become meaningless in a world where<br>
you can replicate anything you need.  My concern is for the *transition* leading<br>
up to it.  I see those years as ones where large segments of the economy become<br>
increasingly automated.  Jobs safe from automation until nanotech would probably<br>
include - doctors, engineers, scientists, artists, programmers, consultants,<br>
advisors, lawyers, etc.<br>
<p>
The question is can blue collar/joe-sixpack adapt to the changing workforce by<br>
becoming a knowledge worker?  I have my doubts.  Also, I believe much of the<br>
service sector will become automated.  One secretary does today what it took<br>
dozens only 30 years ago.  This trend in office automation is continuing.<br>
<p>
However, some interesting counter-proposals from others on the list included<br>
pointing out that the service sector will continue because of a high demand for<br>
'human touch'. Although each company will need less people to do the same thing,<br>
there will be more companies doing it. Dan Fabulich pointed out that with<br>
increasing automation comes increased production at lower costs.  So although<br>
wages will decrease, the price of goods will decrease even more rapidly, thereby<br>
raising the living standard for everybody.<br>
