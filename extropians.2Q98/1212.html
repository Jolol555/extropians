[I would like to have contributed to this thread earlier, but the last few<br>
weeks have been a period of constant work-related travel for me.  So, please<br>
excuse any redundancies . . .]<br>
<p>
First, some comment on ideas that I recall have been mentioned.  I am very<br>
skeptical of the specific figures that have been mentioned regarding wealth<br>
distribution in the US, for the reasons that "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin" sets<br>
out in his (?) post today.  Government ownership, private retirement funds and<br>
insurance tend to distribute asset "ownership" in meaningful ways for large<br>
segments of First World societies, although shallow analyses won't reveal this<br>
fact.  I strongly suspect that the proportion of the overall economy thus<br>
owned in a distributed or joint fashion in these ways offsets to a great<br>
degree the much-touted concentration of ownership relative to some imagined<br>
past golden age.  Nevertheless, I don't doubt that there are meaningful<br>
definitions of "middle class" that will yield at least some concentration of<br>
wealth relative to say 40 or 50 years ago.<br>
<p>
With that said, I agree with Paul Hughes that we are facing an unprecedented<br>
obsolescence for many, many workers.  I can think of only one similar period<br>
in history -- the coming of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th<br>
through the 20th centuries -- and that example offers only poor guidance for<br>
what we can look forward to.  For most "displaced workers" during the<br>
transition to the current paradigm of industrial technology and economy, the<br>
shift to a new mode of living and working took place over a period of years, a<br>
glacial pace compared to the dislocations that probably lie ahead for us now.<br>
The one previous complete paradigm change -- from hunter-gatherer life to that<br>
of settled agriculture, took place over a time scale of many generations, so<br>
it would provide even less guidance, even if we knew the details of how it<br>
really happened in human terms.<br>
<p>
One trend that marked the transition to industrial economy will operate during<br>
the one to a more completely automated economy: More and more people will work<br>
in jobs of "personal service".  Just as many of the service jobs we hold today<br>
could not have been imagined even 50 or 60 years ago -- and certainly not 100<br>
years ago -- likewise, many people will end up doing things that are valued<br>
economically that we cannot envision now.  Take a stroll through any "upscale"<br>
retail establishment and you will see many people ostensibly working at the<br>
job of selling who are not strictly "necessary" in mechanical terms.  I could<br>
buy most consumer item at Neiman Marcus without the "assistance" of the many<br>
"retail clerks" there, but the atmosphere of personal service they lend to the<br>
establishment must be economical, because the owners of the store see fit to<br>
pay their wage.  Likewise, the counter at McDonalds might be more efficient if<br>
I entered my order directly into a keypad and had my food handed to me by a<br>
robot, but I don't doubt that the live human face across the counter is seen<br>
as a value by the operator of the store.<br>
<p>
Thus, simply because it will be a luxury of sorts, having humans do jobs that<br>
robots COULD do will likely become a significant factor in employing many<br>
people who otherwise might become "disemployed".  Such jobs won't be the most<br>
desirable ones and, with a few exceptions I can imagine, probably won't pay<br>
very well.  (The exceptions are interesting, though -- I recall how amazed I<br>
was to learn how much money waiters make in the most prestigious restaurants;<br>
more than $100,000 per year.  Such jobs are admittedly rare.)<br>
<p>
Another factor I have seen mentioned here is the trend toward making<br>
commodities that were once dear essentially free "give-aways"; examples of<br>
matches and water were discussed.  I can see food eventually falling into this<br>
category, as well as even --possibly -- shelter.  Perhaps resorts would offer<br>
princely accommodations to their workers to encourage "qualified" people to<br>
work in their service jobs. Such qualifications might consist of personality<br>
and physical characteristics, rather than intelligence or "productive"<br>
capacity per se.  Thus good looks or a pleasant personality might be much more<br>
worthwhile assets than they are today.  Perhaps only the ugly, rude AND stupid<br>
will need some kind of dole in a truly post-industrial world.<br>
<p>
Examples such as this one tend to make me less than catastrophically worried<br>
about total "disemployment" for the great mass of humanity.  Any techno-<br>
economic system that would make even "trivial" service jobs completely<br>
irrelevant seems likely to be so productive that the whole problem becomes<br>
moot.  <br>
<p>
In the transitional period, it seems likely that the majority of humanity will<br>
continue to do what they do now -- subsistence agriculture.  The largest part<br>
of humanity really isn't even in the 20th century yet, technologically.  At<br>
the point that the first few humans/AIs experience real "technotranscendance",<br>
the largest part of humanity will be "irrelevant" to that process.  But this<br>
says nothing of what those first post-humans will do FOR those left behind.  I<br>
find much of the discussion about fears of what posthumans may do TO the<br>
"left-behinds" implausible; it seems much more likely that the super-<br>
productive powers of posthumans will be employed in what amounts to<br>
philanthropic "uplift": The "extrosattva" of discussions we had here a few<br>
months ago.<br>
