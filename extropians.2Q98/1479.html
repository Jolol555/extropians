Is this the same thing as 'ESP' between two human subjects? I have always<br>
wondered at the reasoning that you can test precognition by letting a person<br>
read the outcome of a chaotic future event (lottery balls), or controlling<br>
the outcome of some sort of digital device. Such experiments seem to be pure<br>
magic.<br>
<p>
For instance - suppose there IS such a thing as telekenesis. If one person<br>
so gifted is present in a room with a lottery machine, he or she might be<br>
able to influence the outcome.<br>
<p>
Now suppose a few million of these gifted people, all wanting to see THEIR<br>
particular numbered balls roll out of the machine. My thought is that the<br>
conflicting forces would give a result indistinguishable from chaos. Similar<br>
reasoning should hold for telepathy or precognition - after all, the<br>
hallmark of a chaotic system is that you don't know where it will settle<br>
until it does. Forgive me if I mangle some definitions here. Perhaps I am<br>
meaning to say 'random'.<br>
<p>
The ideas of telekenesis or telepathy seem more probable when you consider<br>
two similar beings having some remote effect on each other. This kind of<br>
research, done in a proper setting with a properly designed experiment,<br>
should be able to show some results if a sufficiently large pool of test<br>
subjects is used.<br>
<p>
Of course, we will always have 'believers' even if several well-designed<br>
experiments show no support at all for these phenomnena..<br>
