On the contrary:  rather, nobody uses metalanguages in day to day<br>
conversation.  (Lojban advocates, this is where you can pipe up if you<br>
feel like it. :) )  If we did, however, you're right, this is the sort of<br>
thing we'd say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    I like Bart Kosko's notion that Trotskian statements should be </i><br>

<p>
NO, and this is where me must take care.  First, I presume you mean<br>
TARSKIAN statements.  ;)  Second, we may say that our INFORMATION is<br>
imprecise, but the TRUTH is not.  When properly defined, the sky is or is<br>
not blue; we may be only 99% certain of its blueness on a clear day at<br>
noon, but that is VERY different from saying that the sky is 99% blue<br>
(again, restricted by our formal metalanguage).<br>
<p>
We already quite often say in science that the wavelength of certain light<br>
is 550 +/- 10 nm.  This is not to say that the wavelength varies, but<br>
that our information is imprecise.  So, to the extent that it is<br>
necessary, when we need to make clear how certain we are of something, we<br>
will add the precision to which we think we know it. <br>
<p>
We don't need "fuzzy truth" statements: the truth is binary, and we<br>
already have a means of communicating precision.<br>
