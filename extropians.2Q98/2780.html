<i> &gt; Not unless you build them yourself. I'm currently researching</i><br>
<p>
If you're a HAM as are your friends, you're home free. However, the<br>
necessity to approve any RF devices in any civilized surroundings<br>
(frequency space is a valuable resource) and associated costs make<br>
this project impossible in Germany. Can any Europeans comment?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; radio modem plans with a view towards building a bundle of them</i><br>
<i> &gt; with about a dozen of my friends, and setting up a city-wide WAN.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like a good idea, what does the local legislation say? (In<br>
Germany, I'm not sure even line-of-sight laser diode/LED links are legal), <br>
heck, probably just operating boosted IrDA across the street will earn <br>
you a hefty penalty (not that it's detectable, unless somebody rats on <br>
you).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The next step is to run this WAN into an internet feed. While</i><br>
<i> &gt; having a high-speed link would be nice, I'm more interested in a</i><br>
<i> &gt; permanent connection than a fast dial-up link. There are some</i><br>
<p>
Ditto here. A permanent, symmetric ISDN equivalent is currently enough <br>
for me.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; interestingly fast designs floating around, so hopefully I'll be</i><br>
<i> &gt; able to implement a 100k+ link. I'm in Melbourne, Australia,</i><br>
<p>
Are you considering a satellite ISP?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; fwiw.</i><br>
[...]<br>
<i> &gt; [ Linux box as router ]</i><br>
<i> &gt; I wonder how much use the corel NC will be for this purpose? This</i><br>
<p>
I don't know, the box is not very cheap. A salvaged i386/i486 board<br>
with a single-boot/root floppy solution and a few NICs is difficult to <br>
beat, pricewise. You probably can use the NetWinder's 1 MByte flash,<br>
and take the minimal 16 MByte box for router, also, the IrDA <br>
functionality is not bad. If diskless, it's very low power, so <br>
you could run it off battery-buffered photovoltaics (which is <br>
ideal in Oz). But the 10/100 MBit ports is not much for a router, <br>
and the box is not _fantastically_ cheap.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; is basically my plan, I'd like to link up my neighbours, and link</i><br>
<i> &gt; these subnets with my friends' subnets. Economies of scale are</i><br>
<i> &gt; quite useful in this regard, and if I'll I'm providing is access</i><br>
<i> &gt; to the net it's a hell of a lot less hassle than running an ISP.</i><br>
 <br>
Yup.<br>
  <br>
<i> &gt; &gt; [robots ; transhumantech@ ]</i><br>
<i> &gt; I've subscribed to this since it started, as far as I know. What</i><br>
<i> &gt; do you mean by the "effort"?</i><br>
 <br>
Well, it is an effort to contribute ;) Apart from that, there were<br>
supposed to be several contributers, depth-dragging the net for<br>
information filtering/digesting in the process. Otoh, the list as is<br>
already pretty noisy due to yours truly's lack of focus...<br>
