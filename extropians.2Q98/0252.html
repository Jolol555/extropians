Yes I was expecting that, but I was more paraphrasing a quote by someone else<br>
that I can't remember.<br>
<p>
However, you are calling a mercantilist a capitalist, which is not the same<br>
thing. a Capitalist does not beleive in the use of government to enforce one's<br>
own advantage, while many mercantilist types and oligarchists call themselves<br>
capitalists, erroneously.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; My experience suggests that both these accounts, while strictly true only</i><br>
<i>&gt; in extreme but exemplary cases, go a long way toward explaining the world I</i><br>
<i>&gt; live in.  In the last couple of days, a conservative government-supported</i><br>
<i>&gt; stevedoring company sacked more than 2000 unionists on Australian wharves</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply for being members of the union, locking them out and patrolling the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wharves with private muscle and rottweilers.  Workers rallying in protest</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been attacked illegally by irritant gas, which is as close to a gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; against the head as one might wish to see in industrial practice at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; close of the 20th century.  This argues, incidentally, against the claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; that workers can invest on equable terms by command of their own labour.</i><br>
<p>
In a buyers market, commodity products will always come cheaply.  Manual,<br>
unskilled labor will always be the cheapest to be had. Unions and immigration<br>
rules seek to artificially restrict the supply of manual labor, which is why<br>
unions always support immigration restrictions.<br>
<p>
If your union there is anything like the Teamsters here, I can understand why<br>
the owners are using security to keep former employees off their property. That<br>
they have successfully ended the artificial labor supply restrictions they were<br>
suffering under is actually good for the economy in general, no matter how much<br>
short term difficulty the workers may face. I can pretty much guarrantee that<br>
within 1-2 years, if you economic/technical growth is anything like here, most<br>
of those shut out people will be making even more money than they were under<br>
the unions seniority system in jobs that develop greater skills than just<br>
lugging cargo.<br>
<p>
I have no pity for these signs of the obsolescence of high paid human laborers<br>
when a high tech economy needs their brains so much more....<br>
<p>
As an example, in 1990 up to 1992, Boeing Aircraft Company laid off some 15,000<br>
imployees, over 10% of its work force, most of whom lived in the Seattle area,<br>
and they had some of the highest paid manufacturing jobs around. This big<br>
layoff definitely had a ripple effect in the rest of the economy, no doubt<br>
about it, as the real estate boom of the  80's died a quick death, and the<br>
Federal Gov'ts huge excise tax on boats effectively killed the marine industry<br>
in the area. Now 6-8 years later, Boing has hired back less than 5,000 workers,<br>
but is producing more planes than before. The unemployment rate is lower now<br>
than before the layoffs, so this means that those 10,000 other laid off workers<br>
got jobs elsewhere (many of whom started businesses), and the fact that the<br>
average income in the area is higher now indicates that those 10,000 workers<br>
are likely not making less money than they did before.<br>
<p>
Free economies are much more dynamic than centrally planned economies, no doubt<br>
about it. That is not a point of debate. That people aren't guarranteed<br>
lifetime employment means that they will take responsibility to keep their<br>
skills up to date or face the consequences of their actions, or lack thereof.<br>
More dynamic economies do not suffer fools gladly, and they demand efficiency<br>
and technical advancement to keep up the pace of competition. It is no wonder<br>
at all that the most technologically advanced nations are the most economically<br>
dynamic, and that those with the greatest knowledge skills will migrate to<br>
those economies. The US has probably a greater percentage of foreign trained<br>
individuals working in their universities and corporations than any other<br>
industrial nation. It is also indicative that those who live in hidebound<br>
socialist economies but who develop a pride in acheivement will generally seek<br>
to migrate to countries like the US, where their skills are more appreciated.<br>
