Dear fellow (trans)human(ist)s,<br>
<p>
A short and very personal report on some of the things that happened at<br>
Transvision '98. More details and pictures will soon be availabe on the<br>
Transcedo website <a href="http://www.transcedo.org">http://www.transcedo.org</a> with links to related sites,<br>
documents and pictures.<br>
<p>
          --- Weesp (The Netherlands). 5-06-1998, 18:00 hrs CET. ---<br>
After a week of testing beta-code abroad I arrived somewhat late at our<br>
hotel in Weesp, near Amsterdam. I recognized Anders from a picture I once<br>
saw, lot's of other people that I must have talked with many times but had<br>
never seen. I don't think I'll quickly get used to 'knowing' people without<br>
having seen them ;-). I was immediatly having trouble connecting names to<br>
faces (were are those remembrance agents!).<br>
<p>
After passing out the T-shirts to everybody (Gareth Smith - Alcor UK - was<br>
very happy with his shirt displaying Beavis &amp; Butthead waist-deep in ice<br>
saying 'cryonics is cool') we all went next-door for dinner. All trough the<br>
three-courses (good thing they had these multi-lingual menu-cards) there<br>
was lively conversation about all things transhuman. Swapped SF-stories<br>
with Gareth and discussed state-of-the-art computer technology with Holger<br>
and Klaus (?). After dinner we took a short walk across the typical Dutch<br>
town of Weesp (canals, cute houses, fortress and al that), conversation<br>
never let up. A bunch of us found a pub were some Dutch and Belgian special<br>
beers could be tasted, a perfect place to have a discussion about<br>
media-attention and how to use it effectively.<br>
<p>
The next morning most transhumanists seemed to be up &amp; functioning again. <br>
One of the other hotelguests asked us whether we were a religious cult or<br>
something (might have been the T-shirts). Berrie and I explained that we<br>
were studing the future, the elderly lady agreed that this was 'most<br>
important'. Didn't ask her E-mail, darn!<br>
<p>
Berrie Staring opened Transvision '98 officially and gave a presentation<br>
about how Transcedo came about, what we wanted to achieve and our ideas<br>
about global- and European cooperation between transhumanist organisations.<br>
Then Nick Bstrom started of his presentation about the WTA<br>
(<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com">http://www.transhumanist.com</a>) with a rather 'cultish' visualisation<br>
exercise. "Now all close your eyes and think about how good you felt during<br>
the greatest moment of your life, now imagine a future that can be much<br>
better than this and that lasts forever...". Quite a compelling image.<br>
After this warm-up Nick talked about why he had founded the World<br>
Transhumanist Association, it's structure and relation to Transhumanist<br>
organisations everywhere. Nick's presentation ended in discussion and...<br>
Lunch! Bread and Dutch hot-meatsnacks known as 'kroketten'. Since the<br>
thunderstorm seemed to be taking an lunch-break also we went outside for<br>
some photo-opportunities by the canal.<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg talked &amp; gestured about 'How to lead a transhuman life'.<br>
All the things one can do _now_ with an emphasis on our motivational<br>
system. This presentation can best be described by Anders himself and he<br>
will do so at some time in the future on his website<br>
<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/</a>. So be patient ;-)<br>
<p>
In spite of the very interesting speech Anders had given my sleep-shortage<br>
was feeling quite serious by now wich was bad since I was next in line as a<br>
speaker. A caffeine-injection got me going again and I played my role as<br>
devil's advocate trying to explain why  I wasn't thinking about a<br>
cryo-contract. Using mountainclimbing as an example of pushing your limits<br>
'till it kills you. Gareth Smith was looking physically affected after a<br>
while and since dead-bodies at a Transhumanst convention would make bad<br>
press a decided to call it quits and put forth my two other 'points for<br>
discussion'<br>
- How to make new technology's acceptable? <br>
Taking IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) as an example I proposed that finding a<br>
economical application was the shortest route. In the case of IVF that did<br>
the trick in about 10 years. Not everybody agreed and that was precisely my<br>
intention.<br>
- More jokes! We need more humor in our communication of Transhuman memes.<br>
The T-shirts with Beavis&amp;Butthead 'cryonics is cool' are a big hit. If we<br>
are talking to people about heavy subject like (the prevention of)death and<br>
immortality and such it would be good to 'lighten up' things every now and<br>
then with a joke.<br>
<p>
After this Berrie was wrapping-up the afternoon when I felt 'that sinking<br>
feeling' one has when suffering _severe_ sleep deprivation. So I took the<br>
only real medicine: A long night of sleep. Regrettably this meant I missed<br>
the second dinner and many, undoubtedly facinating &amp; fun discussions.<br>
Whilst my unconsious body was recouperating from the last week several<br>
participants visited Amsterdam or closerby night-life.<br>
<p>
The next morning several people felt the consequences of cerebral<br>
de-hydration caused by the consumption of serious amounts of alcohol (this<br>
is to say, they had a hangover ;-). A bit later than planned Gareth Smith<br>
got started on his presentation about cryonics. After some introductory<br>
cryobiology he talked about how he made the desicion to sign up, and gave<br>
some practical examples of the problems one encounters when setting-up<br>
basic cryo-facility.<br>
"You can win the lottery that gives immortality but it does require that<br>
you buy a lotteryticket". A cryo-contract as a small investment for a shot<br>
at immortality. There was much discussion about the practical<br>
implementation of a European cryo-network. Probably the various<br>
organisations wil share resources to make cryonics feasible in Europe<br>
(training&amp;education, installations and equipement). Holland, with it's<br>
liberal laws on euthanasia could possibly be a very good place to have<br>
suspensions under controlled circumstances. We will be looking into legal<br>
loopholes that can be exloited, where neccesary.<br>
<p>
During the follwing wrap-up some points were agreed on:<br>
<p>
- There will be a Transhumanist gathering on the 4th through 6th of june 1999<br>
  in Stockholm, Sweden, hosted by Aleph.<br>
- German, French and Belgium sites &amp; Transhumanist groups will be brought into<br>
  existance and the other European oranisations wil assist them.<br>
- Multi-lingual press-kits will become availiable on the various website's<br>
- We will cooperate on processes and procedures relevant to dealing with <br>
  media-attention<br>
- We will actively recruit new members trough the web and by other means<br>
- Improved introductionary texts to Transhumanism will be created<br>
- We will actively seek more structured funding<br>
- Special Interest Groups for certain projects (such as a documentary on<br>
  transhumanism fo a general audience and a memetics group) will be created.<br>
<p>
In spite of some minor tehnical difficulties the first European<br>
transhumanist gathering was a great succes. We had a number great<br>
discussions, informal talks and most important: a lot of fun! I feel<br>
confident that all participents feel strengthened and that these gatherings<br>
will become regular milestones on the road of growing transhumanism in Europe.<br>
<p>
On a more personal note, I'd like to thank everyone who helped organizing<br>
this event, the speakers and everyone who made it great by attending and<br>
particiating. Thank to you all!<br>
<p>
Kind regards to all and looking forward to future meetings. European<br>
transhumanism is on the move!<br>
