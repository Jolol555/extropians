<i>&gt;&gt;    as a rule it maximizes social outcomes, which </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    is utilitarian, but utility comes second.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think you misunderstood me.  My point was simply that your reasons for</i><br>
<i>&gt;accepting a "truth-first" principle were utilitarian in origin: that</i><br>
<i>&gt;people would be better off if we all accepted "truth-first."  Well, if we</i><br>
<i>&gt;WOULD be better off thanks to "truth-first," then utilitarianism demands</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we act according to "truth-first;" thus we would accept it BECAUSE of</i><br>
<i>&gt;utilitarisnism, not in spite of it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: If utilitarianism is the greatest good <br>
   for the greatest number, and there are a set<br>
   of theories as to which course of action will<br>
   achieve that goal, which course do we choose?<br>
   The course that is true, that is, the course<br>
   which the evidence best indicates will yield<br>
   the desired outcome. So truth directs utility<br>
   and in this way truth is useful.  It may be<br>
   that the two define each other inseperably.<br>
<p>
   So if we believe it's true that the greater<br>
   good is served by truth first, the 2 are 1.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;thought experiment&gt; Suppose you are studying an important effect in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;quantum mechanics, but one which can be put off until later without</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;significant losses in utility.  Then, you look out the window and you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;see: A Drowning Child (tm) [the philosopher's favorite play toy!]. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;You could save that child now and study quantum effects later, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;OR you could just ignore the child and continue the pursuit of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;one-to-one truth function.  Despite the fact that utilitarianism demands</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;that you save that child, truth-first demands that truth comes first, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;utility second.  You ignore the child, and finish observing your quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;effect before even considering saving him/her. &lt;/thought experiment&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: An interesting dilemma, but I think it </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    may be a false dilemma. Maybe I cannot swim,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    and I have no rope, or just don't care, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    saving the drowning child is not useful to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    me, afterall, that kid was a real nuisance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Uhm...  SINCE this is a thought experiment, I can always tweak it.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;should have mentioned that you are ABLE to save the child, if you decided</i><br>
<i>&gt;to, at a trivial loss of utility to yourself.  (This was actually part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the reason why I mentioned the "Drowning Child (tm):" ehtical philosophers</i><br>
<i>&gt;REGULARLY use this as a thought experiment: you could either save the</i><br>
<i>&gt;child or do something else.  Which do you do?)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    IAN: I still think it's a false dilemma, going <br>
    to save the child does not mean the scientist<br>
    violates truth-first. If I adhere to truth-first<br>
    and reject "greater-good utilitarianism" and get<br>
    sleepy and stop working and sleep, that does not<br>
    mean I have violated the truth-first principle.<br>
