KG&gt; The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition;<br>
KG&gt; that purpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free,<br>
KG&gt; unregulated market will inevitably lead to the establishment of<br>
KG&gt; coercive monopolies.<br>
<p>
That "socialist fallacy" falls very closely in line with historical fact in<br>
many industries, particularly those which depend upon huge capital<br>
investments.  Banking, for example.<br>
<p>
KG&gt; But, in fact, no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be<br>
KG&gt; established by means of free trade on a free market.<br>
<p>
And if anyone finds an example -- such as Microsoft -- then we'll ignore it,<br>
since it does't fit into our theory.  Although to be fair, Microsoft's<br>
monopoly *is* enforced by the power of the US Government, in the form of many<br>
copyrights and software patents.  Just imagine how quickly Microsoft would<br>
crack down in the courts on any company that produced a MS-Windows compatible<br>
OS!<br>
<p>
Microsoft *obviously* have a monopoly.  No other company is legally able to<br>
produce operating systems compatible with the huge majority of software<br>
available on the marketplace -- software designed for MS-Windows.  There are<br>
not only legal obstacles preventing any other company from muscling in, but<br>
also technical roadblocks: MS have very intentionally made their OS large and<br>
complex, and its inner workings occult, and subject to periodic change, so<br>
that it's impractical for any competitor to attempt cloning it.  (They were<br>
stung once by DR-DOS, so obviously Mr. Gates doesn't want that happening<br>
again.)<br>
<p>
I make no secret of my antipathy toward Microsoft.  This company has<br>
single-handedly set back the development of the computer industry 10 years or<br>
more.  They've built incredible success upon grossly inferior (often downright<br>
bone-headed) products and lucky historical accidents.  They've used their<br>
"compatibility standards" as a mallet to bludgeon down any competing platforms<br>
or innovative products that might have challenged them.  They bought and<br>
buried competitors who they couldn't otherwise crush.  Worst of all, Microsoft<br>
have colluded with hardware makers and retailers to lock PC owners into a<br>
never-ending spiral of hardware and software upgrades (driven by<br>
ever-more-inefficient MS operating systems), a scam that has bilked consumers<br>
out of untold billions of dollars.<br>
<p>
A couple of days ago I saw a telling clip on the news.  They were talking<br>
about possible legal trouble for the release of Windows98.  They had an expert<br>
who said THE INDUSTRY REALLY NEEDS WINDOWS98!  Why did he think we need it so<br>
badly?  Because it's a better product?  It will allow people to do more with<br>
their computers?  No...  He said WE NEED IT TO STIMULATE SALES OF HARDWARE AND<br>
SOFTWARE.  Of course!  Win98 will need more RAM, more processor speed, more<br>
hard drive space -- so, people will have to upgrade their computers.  That's<br>
good for business!  And all the software companies will jump in with new and<br>
improved software, designed to "take advantage of the advanced features of<br>
Windows98".  The new software won't actually be any more useful than the old<br>
software, only somewhat bigger and slower, but it'll sure be good for sales!<br>
<p>
Many people in the industry are not afraid to admit publicly that this scam is<br>
taking place.  Why should they care if people know?  It's not like there's any<br>
other viable platform that people can turn to.  Oh, there's Macintosh, I<br>
guess, but Mr. Gates now has a finger in that pie too.<br>
<p>
Finally, an observation that was recently published in The Funny Times:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The classically-minded among us may have noted a new TV ad for</i><br>
<i> &gt; Microsoft's Internet Explorer e-mail (sic) program which features</i><br>
<i> &gt; the cheery line "Where do you want to go today?" while the chorus</i><br>
<i> &gt; sings "Confutatis maledictis, flammis acribus addictis" from</i><br>
<i> &gt; Mozart's Requiem.  It means: "The damned and the accursed are</i><br>
<i> &gt; convicted to the flames of hell."</i><br>
