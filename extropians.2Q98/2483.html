<i>&gt; profoundly depressing thought, I'd hate to think it's true.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but as time goes on, it definitely seems like we are at least making it<br>
happen, eh??<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;what if we lived in a globular cluster, so that the nearest stars</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;were only a few light days away,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The heavier elements are made in supernova explosions but globular clusters</i><br>
<i>&gt; are made up of population one stars that are very old and created out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original stuff from the Big Bang, so most metals vital for a technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilization like iron, copper, tin and uranium would be virtually nonexistent</i><br>
<i>&gt; in them. Even carbon would be rare making life in globular clusters doubtful.</i><br>
<p>
Additionally, I was under the impression that globular clusters with stars so<br>
close would have much higher density, levels of radiation than there is in our own<br>
vicinity, so we would need to live on a much larger planet with a much more<br>
pronounced EM field to protect us from that radiation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Another problem is that we would be ignorant of the larger universe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything would be so crowded together we'd only be able to see things a</i><br>
<i>&gt; few hundred light years away and we'd think that was the entire universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;and the home planet had a low gravity field?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A planet much smaller than the Earth couldn't hold on to a substantial</i><br>
<i>&gt; atmospheric. A planet much larger than the Earth would be able to retain so</i><br>
<i>&gt; much of the primordial hydrogen that was common during its formation that</i><br>
<i>&gt; free oxygen would be impossible.</i><br>
<p>
Considering that Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, yet has a much much denser<br>
atmosphere (most likely due to its lack of a moon the size of our own), it is<br>
evident that intelligent life of our kind could possibly evolve on a smaller<br>
planet than ours with no large moon that had an earth normal atmosphere. For<br>
example, if Mars, which has 1/3 of the gravity of our own planet, were in the<br>
orbit of our own world, the solar flux levels would be high enough for it to have<br>
an earth normal atmosphere (most of Mars' early atmosphere, which was close to<br>
earth normal, is now bound in the crust due to the cold). It could have a moon<br>
only a few hundred miles across to give it sufficient tide to enable enough<br>
tectonic activity for volcanic fertilization, for maintainance of the mantle/core<br>
dynamo that would generate a radiation protection EM field, as well as a near<br>
enough location for inspiration of a manned space program in a technological<br>
society.<br>
<p>
With a 1/3 G field, it would be almost infinitely easier to afford widespread<br>
space travel, as it would be within the capability of a supersonic jet plane to<br>
escape a 1/3 gravity field. Thus, it would cost the equivalent of a Concorde<br>
ticket for a normal person to fly into space...$2,000.00<br>
