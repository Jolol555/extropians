<i>        &gt;Science is our greatest method for finding truth, but religion         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;generates meaning.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have no religion, yet from the time I was in the first grade I've had the  <br>
ability to make sense out of many ASCII strings, including the sequence you  <br>
just sent me, so obviously religion can't be the only thing that generates  <br>
meaning. I suppose you'll tell me religion can give me some sort of ultimate, <br>
if nebulous, meaning but the trouble is if you tell me "X" is the meaning of <br>
life then the obvious question is "What is the meaning of X ?". <br>
And what is the meaning of meaning anyway?<br>
<p>
               <br>
<i>      &gt;integrate Science AND religion... It can be done, if you want to do it</i><br>
          <br>
Correct, Science can be polluted in that way.<br>
<p>
          <br>
<i>        &gt;I get the feeling you don't, however         </i><br>
<p>
Correct. <br>
          <br>
<i>           &gt;and your life will remain meaningless...</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It would certainly be helpful if you could provide some examples, why is my <br>
life "meaningless" and why would I be better off if it were not?<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;I don't know what "freedom of spirit" means.</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;and you never will until you find it</i><br>
<p>
<p>
So help me find it. You used the term so I assume you know what it means, how  <br>
about giving me a hint, who knows, I may already agree with you that we have  <br>
"freedom of spirit".<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;you are already a dedicated worshipper of _S_cience and its High         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Priests, Fenyman, Sagan, et al.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Is there any particular reason you feel it's necessary to brand these two <br>
splendid human beings with that insult?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'll say it again. Science will lead you to Truth, </i><br>
        <br>
OK                        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Religion will lead you to meaning.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
But I don't understand your meaning. Just one specific example where religion <br>
helped anybody understand anything would be more useful in communicating your <br>
ideas than a thousand more vague platitudes.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Avoid the Bible if it grieves you so, but find some spirit — have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you tried Taoism? </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
As I've admitted before, at one time I thought all mystics were fools, then I <br>
read a wonderful book written by a mystic Named Raymond Smullyan called <br>
"The Tao is silent". I disagree with Smullyan on lots of stuff but the man is <br>
quite definitely not a fool.<br>
<p>
I respect Taoism, at least as it was originally taught by Laotse, but then, <br>
Taoism is not a religion. Unlike a religion Taoism asks profound questions  <br>
it does not provide vapid answers, it claims no revealed truth, it takes no  <br>
position on the existence of God and doesn't even have a position on the <br>
truth of Taoism. If you want to call something like that a religion then I'm <br>
a religious man.<br>
