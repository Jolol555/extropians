<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's just one way to develop AI. There might very well be others. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; any case, it wouldn't be very smart to just make an upgraded human</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; (with an attitude). Genie AIs is what we want, mindless servants.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Then I think that your type of AI falls more into the categori of IA</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (Intelligence Amplification.) This is where very strong technical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; support systems enhances the human mind. But they are not self aware. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; little like computers and the internet today, but only much smarter and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more developed. Ingenious interfaces. Mindless Servants if you want.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, yes, that's basically what I want. </i><br>
<p>
Me too. In many ways IA is the key to transhumanity. <br>
<p>
However, I'm also quite fond of the idea of creating new<br>
intelligences. Why? Because I want to promote maximum diversity, and<br>
AI could probably become much more diverse than homo sapiens derived<br>
entities (and if we add in various forms of human-AI symbiosis the<br>
diversity becomes even greater).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not a new kind of artificial,</i><br>
<i>&gt; superfast and highly intelligent humanoid with a "will", but a machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that can (more or less autonomously) conduct research at a lightning </i><br>
<i>&gt; pace. A machine that doesn't ponder ethics, but rather dutifully serves</i><br>
<i>&gt; and protects humans becuase it's been programmed that way. </i><br>
<p>
As was pointed out in the other ethics thread, ethics is what you<br>
should do. The genie machine has a built in ethics of serve and<br>
protect humans. But if it doesn't ponder the ethics, it would not be<br>
able to apply it well. What if I ask it to make me a weapon to kill<br>
anybody who disagrees with me? What it should do is to deduce that<br>
answering "No way!" is the best way of serve and protect humans,<br>
including its owner (me) because if I got the weapon and used it, a<br>
lot of others would likely attack me with equally nasty weapons. That<br>
is a fairly clear-cut case, but what if the ethical problem becomes<br>
more tricky? It needs to deduce extensions of its ethics, or it will<br>
be inefficient or dangerous.<br>
<p>
(This reminds me of the "zeroth law of robotics" some of Asimov's<br>
robots came up with, although the logical reasoning behind it remains<br>
unclear to me).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although this machine wouldn't be "conscious" like a human, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonetheless still classify as "intelligent", since it could</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn from its own and other's mistakes or success, and improve</i><br>
<i>&gt; its performance. Is this what they call "weak" AI?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure, but it is close. I seem to recall that "weak" AI is<br>
systems that can do a lot of apparently intelligent stuff, but aren't<br>
really intelligent. Strong AI claims that it is possible to build<br>
truly intelligent systems. Maybe a better term would be Asimov AI - AI<br>
with built in servitor programming.<br>
