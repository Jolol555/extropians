"Alcohol Consumption and Mortality. I. Characteristics of Drinking Groups"<br>
<p>
Abstract:<br>
<p>
Aims. This is the first of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status<br>
and mortality risk. Analyses of multiple studies describe associations of<br>
drinking patterns with characteristics hypothesized to confound the<br>
relationships between drinking status and mortality. Characteristics which<br>
both significantly differentiate drinking groups and are consistent across<br>
studies would suggest that mortality studies not controlling for them may<br>
be compromised.<br>
<p>
Design and participants. Associations are evaluated from the raw data of 10<br>
general population studies which contained mortality data. Long-term<br>
abstainers are compared to former drinkers, long-term abstainers and former<br>
drinkers are compared to light drinkers (by quantitiy, frequency and volume<br>
in separate analyses) and moderate to heavy drinkers are compared to light<br>
drinkers. Tetrachoric correlation coefficients assess statistical<br>
significance; meta-analysis determines if associations are homogeneous<br>
across studies.<br>
<p>
Measurements. Measures of alcohol consumption are quantity, frequency and<br>
volume; long-term abstainers are differentiated from former drinkers.<br>
Multiple measures of health, social position, social integration and mental<br>
health characteristics are evaluated.<br>
<p>
Findings. Across studies, adult male former drinkers are consistently more<br>
likely to be heavier smokers, depressed, unemployed, lower SES and to have<br>
used marijuana than long-term abstainers. Adult female former drinkers are<br>
consistently more likely to be heavier smokers, in poorer health, not<br>
religious, and unmarried than long-term abstainers. Both types of<br>
abstainers are more likely to be of normal or overweight than light<br>
drinkers.<br>
<p>
Conclusions. Characteristics of two groups of abstainers, other than their<br>
non-use of alcohol, may confound the associations found between drinking<br>
and mortality risk.<br>

"Alcohol Consumption and Mortality. II Studies of Male Populations"<br>
<p>
Abstract<br>
<p>
Aims. This is the second of a set of three papers evaluating drinking<br>
status and mortality risk. Analysis of eight general population surveys of<br>
men evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern.<br>
<p>
Design and participants. Raw data from three studies of youth and five<br>
studies of adults were evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for<br>
confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results.<br>
<p>
Measurements. Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity,<br>
frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern<br>
(as well as abstinence in the youth models and long-term abstainers and<br>
former drinkers in adult models), age and other confounding variables.<br>
Models also evaluated interactions of age and , respectively, long-term<br>
abstinence and former drinking.<br>
<p>
Findings. No evidence was found for the hypothesis that abstinence is<br>
associated with greater mortality risk than light drinking. In the youth<br>
samples, abstainers had a lower risk of dying than those drinking less than<br>
15 times per month. One study of the adult samples showed a significant age<br>
by former drinker interaction; this did not alter the lack of association<br>
of former drinking with mortality risk or the homogeneity of results across<br>
studies for this finding. The most consistent finding was the association<br>
of heavy drinking with mortality among youth. Among adults, drinking 43 or<br>
more drinks per month and drinking 21 or more times per month were<br>
associated with increased mortality risk. Quantity per occasion was not<br>
significantly associated with mortality risk among adults.<br>
<p>
Conclusions. That frequent drinking was related to mortality risk, whereas<br>
heavier quantity was unrelated, is inconsistent with the belief that daily<br>
consumption of a few glasses of wine has salutary effects. Empirically,<br>
however this pattern tends to be unusual. Findings were homogeneous across<br>
studies lending generalizability to results.<br>

"Alcohol Consumption and Mortality. III Studies of Female Populations"<br>
<p>
Abstract<br>
<p>
Aims. This is the third of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status<br>
and mortality risk. Analysis of three general population surveys of women<br>
evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking patterns.<br>
<p>
Design and participants. Raw data from three studies of adult women were<br>
evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for confounding<br>
characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results.<br>
<p>
Measurements. Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity,<br>
frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern<br>
(including long-term abstainers and former drinkers) as well as age and<br>
other confounding variables. Models also evaluated interactions of age and,<br>
respectively, long-term abstainence and former drinking.<br>
<p>
Findings. In models in which age was controlled, odds of death for<br>
long-term abstainers and former drinkers (defined by volume or quantity)<br>
were greater than those for light drinkers; odds of death for moderate and<br>
heavy drinkers (defined by quantity) were greater than those for light<br>
drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death<br>
were similar for abstainers and light drinkers. When other psychosocial<br>
attributes were controlled, odds of death for heavy drinkers (defined by<br>
volume and quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When<br>
interactions of age and the two forms of abstinence were introduced, one<br>
study showed a significant effect of age and former drinking.<br>
<p>
Conclusions. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that<br>
characteristics of abstainers other than their non-use of alcohol may<br>
account for their higher mortality risk. With the exception of former<br>
drinkers compared to light drinkers, when interactions were introduced into<br>
models (for measures of quantity and frequency) findings were homogeneous<br>
across studies, lending generalizability to results.<br>
