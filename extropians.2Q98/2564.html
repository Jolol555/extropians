Why would we want to give AI emotions?  Emotions are an evolutionary<br>
development to enable us to better our chances of survival in highly<br>
political hunter-gatherer societies.  I doubt if AI are going to have to<br>
reproduce sexually, compete for mates, compete for food, play game-theory to<br>
increase their survival chances, and do all the other things that<br>
hunter-gatherers and their immediate descendants (us) have to do to ensure<br>
that our replicators get to replicate.  So why fetter them with a gamut of<br>
often counter-productive drives and restraints that cause humans so much<br>
trouble?<br>
