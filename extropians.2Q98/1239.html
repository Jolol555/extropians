The idea of base 1 arithmetic is fine as a thought experiment, but it seems<br>
to me that you lose any advantage to 'packing' information. If you want to<br>
express a large number, you will end up with a huge number of 'bits' so to<br>
speak. A useful computer would be awfully complex.<br>
<p>
Also, if you only have one symbol for the base one system, how do you<br>
represent zero? No symbols at all?<br>
<p>
I think that by the time software evolves to the point of being able to<br>
drive a true AI, the individual bits and underpinnings will matter as much<br>
to this entity as the precise operations of our brains matters to us on a<br>
moment to moment basis. Likely, a digital computer based AI will be a lousy<br>
computer programmer, at least as far as modifying it's own 'brain' on an<br>
instant to instant basis..<br>
