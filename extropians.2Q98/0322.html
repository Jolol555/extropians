&lt;&lt; Except that the argument was not that taxation makes going into<br>
business more difficult, but that it is impossible, because the<br>
non-capital owning proletariat cannot afford it, being as poor as we<br>
are.<br>
<p>
I totally agree with your point, but it is an argument for decreasing/<br>
reorganizing taxation, not to eliminate privately-owned capital. &gt;&gt;<br>
 <br>
And I totally agree with your point.&lt;g&gt;  I wasn't aware that the post<br>
under discussion had advocated eliminating *privately-owned capital.* <br>
As an Objectivist, I regard any attempt to deprive men of the right to<br>
property as totally destructive of the needs and rights of free human<br>
beings.<br>
