Of course the card can be used to track your movements...every time you use<br>
it, your position will be known....if it is required for many many uses by<br>
government fiat.<br>
<p>
I want the government as inefficient as possible in enforcing its dirty<br>
stinking laws.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Gee, I never noticed magnetic stripes before!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Other cards that have magnetic strips: credit cards, ATM cards, hotel</i><br>
keys,<br>
appt keys, et al.  The magnetic strips can't be used to somehow follow your<br>
movements.  But the author of the article seems more interested in<br>
propogating<br>
a juvenile kind of paranoia than paying much attention to the benefits of<br>
such<br>
a system or to the fact that the system really doesn't add any new powers to<br>
the government but only makes the government more efficient.  In any<br>
immensely<br>
large and complex society such as ours a standardized identification system<br>
makes perfect sense.  And the presence of it simply has nothing to do with<br>
government encroachment of anyone's rights.  It DOES have to do with making<br>
the government more efficient.  The place to protect rights, however, is in<br>
the courts and the legislatures, and NOT upon the assumption of governmental<br>
inefficiency in enforcing its laws.<br>
