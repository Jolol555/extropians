If I had a time machine I wouldn't go back to watch the building of Khufu's  <br>
Great Pyramid, I would go back 30 years earlier during the time of Khufu's <br>
father, Zoser, during the construction of the Step Pyramid, because then I <br>
could meet Imhotep, Pharaoh's engineer and the first great scientific  genius <br>
we can put a name on. Nobody knows who first tamed fire. <br>
<p>
Imhotep does not seem to have been of high birth, which makes the great  <br>
respect he enjoyed even in his own lifetime especially significant, later <br>
generations made him a God of course. I'm sure his exploits were greatly <br>
exaggerated but I think there must have been an individual of extraordinary<br>
ability around this time, a lot of brilliant things were happening and they  <br>
don't look like the work of a committee to me. It's not easy to go from small <br>
mud huts to huge stone structures in one generation, but Imhotep figured out <br>
how to do it. The step Pyramid was the prototype, the builder of Khufu's <br>
Great Pyramid was just following the design and construction principles that <br>
Imhotep  established.<br>
