I see your point, defining the distinction between utilitarianism and egoism,<br>
perhaps I am merely the victim of liberal memes which have pretty successfully<br>
dovetailed utilitarianism and egoism in the minds of the general populace. THis<br>
is something that has bothered me in the past. Perhaps we need to find or create<br>
some good counter memes to promote....<br>
<p>

<p>
While most armchair proponents of anarcho-socialism may have the wide eyed,<br>
devoted beleif that they will wind up in an anarchical communist state, keep in<br>
mind that both the Russians and Chinese thought the same thing prior to their<br>
evolution, or at least included it in their propaganda. I think that it has been<br>
repeatedly and sufficiently demonstrated in the dozens of failed communist<br>
revolutions that while the rank and file may beleive this propaganda whole<br>
heartedly, the hard core leadership of any such movement always tends to prefer<br>
to grab power when it has been sufficiently demonstrated that most people do not<br>
want to live in such an anarchical communist paradise. They find that they need<br>
to shove it down people's throats at the point of a gun, or in the case of Pol<br>
Pot, kill anyone at all who merely has the potential to think for themselves.<br>
<p>
An afterthought: I noticed in the news that the IRA, while accepting the new<br>
peace agreement, still maintains as its goal the eventual establishment of a<br>
socialist state in Northern Ireland....I think that this is a good indicator of<br>
their seriousness and honesty in regard to the current agreement...<br>
