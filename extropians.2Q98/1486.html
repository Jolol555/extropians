&lt; Basic tenets of Objectivism are, as Rand and others<br>
put it: Metaphysics: Reality; Epistemology: Reason;<br>
Ethics: Rational Self-Interest; Politics:<br>
Laissez-faire capitalism; Esthetics: Romanticism &gt;<br>
<p>
I said I hadn't read any *books* on Objectivism; but,<br>
looking back through my Web-browsing notes, I find<br>
that it was precisely one year ago that I first<br>
checked out Mark J. Gardner's "What is Objectivism?"<br>
ORG page! (<br>
<a href="http://www.oms.com/org/objectivism/index.html">http://www.oms.com/org/objectivism/index.html</a>) <br>
<p>
------------<br>
There, under METAPHYSICS, Gardner says:<br>
"The things we observe with our senses are real and<br>
primary; the contents of our minds -- ideas and<br>
emotions -- are secondary, and have no independent<br>
validity unless they correspond to the facts of the<br>
outside world."<br>
<p>
This sounds reasonable; but, being naturally playful,<br>
I like to invert this somewhat and propose:<br>
Our sensation of and embodied interaction with the<br>
world is real and primary; there are no independent<br>
objects and theories apart from this interaction.<br>
<p>
------------<br>
Looking under EPISTEMOLOGY (Gardner is referencing:<br>
Rand, _Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_):<br>
"Animals can only know what trees they have seen in<br>
their lifetime; because of concepts, man can reach<br>
basic conclusions about all trees -- including those<br>
he has never seen."<br>
<p>
I wonder how Objectivists can know this so certainly<br>
about animals and other humans!  What kind of "basic<br>
conclusion" would I want to reach about a tree that I<br>
had never seen?  If I was a person indigenous to an<br>
environment near the Arctic circle and had only seen<br>
an occasional evergreen tree I might erroneously<br>
decide that deciduous trees of lower latitudes were<br>
not trees at all.<br>
<p>
So, this seems somewhat contradictory to what follows<br>
(which I basically agree with):<br>
"Induction is merely one half of the process of<br>
thought; true knowledge must not only be based on the<br>
observed facts of reality, it must integrate in a<br>
non-contradictory manner with all one's other<br>
knowledge." In practice, I usually manage to<br>
accomplish this well enough to survive and thrive. <br>
In principle, though (that is, in thought), I find<br>
this impossible, and am often perturbed by seemingly<br>
contradictory concepts (like metaphorical Baobab<br>
trees with their 'roots' in the air).<br>
<p>
So, Rand's epistemology is logic.  There seem to be<br>
several types of logic, however.  Some excellent<br>
discourse on these, conducted over a century ago by<br>
Charles S. Peirce, is 'still' available online at<br>
<a href="http://www.peirce.org">http://www.peirce.org</a> (cf., "Questions Concerning<br>
Certain Faculties Claimed for Man", "On a New List of<br>
Categories", and "Some Consequences of Four<br>
Incapacities" - looking briefly at these again, this<br>
last one looks especially relevant to debates about<br>
Objectivism).<br>
<p>
------------<br>
Regarding ETHICS, bouncing back to Gardner's ORG page<br>
on this, the first thing I see is: "Valuing is solely<br>
an attribute of animate matter. Inanimate matter<br>
cannot act, because it has nothing to act for;<br>
although its form can change, matter itself cannot be<br>
destroyed, i.e., go out of existence."<br>
<p>
Just for fun, I'd like to contrast this with the<br>
following excerpt from William T. Powers' essay "The<br>
Origins Of Purpose: The First Metasystem Transitions"<br>
(Powers has been developing perceptual control<br>
systems since the early 1950s; this essay is<br>
available at<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.vub.ac.be/pub/projects/Principia_Cybernetica/WF-issue/Powers.txt">ftp://ftp.vub.ac.be/pub/projects/Principia_Cybernetica/WF-issue/Powers.txt</a>):<br>
"In a control-system model, a purpose is simply a<br>
reference signal... The purpose of a control system,<br>
in the final analysis, is to control some effect of<br>
the environment on it, via its sensors, around a<br>
specific state or condition or level... This concept<br>
of purpose, of course, does not entail any cognitive<br>
abilities or any ability to symbolize the purpose, to<br>
think about it. It is simply an inherent property of<br>
a control system, whether simple or complex."  Powers<br>
gives an interesting example of how even molecules in<br>
a solution can comprise a very simple control system.<br>
<p>
Powers' conclusion here, I think, is worth quoting:<br>
"Knowing control theory, we can freely use such terms<br>
as intending, having a purpose, willing, and<br>
desiring, because we can now see that the fundamental<br>
meaning of such terms is defined by a particular<br>
relationship between a system and its environment, a<br>
relationship that has nothing to do with<br>
verbalizations, reasoning, or cognitions of any kind.<br>
Purpose is a far more fundamental phenomenon than any<br>
of its various manifestations. It is, I propose, the<br>
very basis of life."<br>
<p>
When Gardner says "Values are thus the means to<br>
sustaining life: that which furthers life is a value,<br>
and is the good; that which harms or destroys life is<br>
a disvalue, and is bad or evil", I have to say that<br>
this seems somewhat simplistic when the means to<br>
sustaining my life sometimes involves destroying<br>
other life.<br>
<p>
------------<br>
Ah, POLITICS! Gardner refers to the chapter on "Man's<br>
Rights" in Ayn Rand's _The Virtue of Selfishness_ <br>
and says: "Due to man's moral autonomy, no man can<br>
have a positive claim on the life of another; rights<br>
serve as a negative obligation, stating that a man<br>
must be left free to live his own life by his own<br>
mind, so long as he leaves others free to do the<br>
same. The most fundamental right is the right to<br>
life, and the right to property is its practical<br>
implementation."<br>
<p>
Although this is a very brief overview, I agree with<br>
it wholeheartedly, even as I am unsure of all its<br>
ramifications. As an example, consider the current<br>
debate over 'intellectual property' and the Thomas<br>
Jefferson quote: "That ideas should freely spread<br>
from one to another over the globe, for the moral and<br>
mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his<br>
condition, seems to have been peculiarly and<br>
benevolently designed by nature..."<br>
<p>
BTW, there was an excerpt from Michael Spicer,<br>
"Public Administration, Social Science, And Political<br>
Association". _Administration &amp; Society_ (March 1998)<br>
on the Hayek list last week (see<br>
<a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9804">http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9804</a>&amp;L=hayek-l&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=10734)<br>
that made the interesting distinction between<br>
'purposive' and 'civil' associations:<br>
<p>
" ,,,  In a purposive association, it is necessary<br>
that individual actions be conducive to the<br>
attainment of the substantive ends of the state... On<br>
the other hand, in a civil association, it is not<br>
necessary that individuals undertake particular<br>
actions that conform to certain substantive ends of<br>
the state because a civil association does not<br>
explicitly posit any such ends."<br>
<p>
What's most interesting to me here is the<br>
implications for human knowledge (citing same article):<br>
"In particular, given the availability of individual<br>
discretion over actions within a civil association,<br>
much of the information or knowledge that men and<br>
women use in deciding on what actions they will<br>
undertake is inevitably dispersed and is, therefore,<br>
inaccessible to any single mind or group of minds,<br>
including those of social scientists."<br>
<p>
Somehow this doesn't sound like an Objectivist<br>
definition of knowledge to me, but that may be due to<br>
my shallow understanding of understanding in<br>
Objectivist terms.<br>
<p>
------------<br>
Last, but not least, ESTHETICS.<br>
<p>
I'm not really comfortable with the notion of<br>
romantic heroism, at least not with focusing on such<br>
escapades, because, as LDC put it the other day: "The<br>
myth of the small lone inventor coming up with a<br>
unique and marvellous idea out of nothing in his<br>
garage is fairy tale... A /true/ creative mind<br>
honestly acknowledges that nothing is created in a<br>
vacuum; every 'creation' is a synthesis of old ideas<br>
from a thousand sources, and maybe one or two<br>
randomly strewn new ones."<br>
<p>
Gardner's page on this declares: "Thus the type of<br>
art most consistent with man's nature is romantic<br>
realism. This school emphasizes the fact that man is<br>
a volitional being, capable of setting values and<br>
striving to achieve them."<br>
<p>
I, too, see no esthetic value in emphasizing despair<br>
and negativity (I wonder: is "Crucifix in Urine" a<br>
positive, negative or irrelevant artistic statement<br>
to an atheist?); yet, striving *is* about overcoming<br>
obstacles, and some of the most satisfying works of<br>
'art', to me, are simply natural (and cultural)<br>
scenes where decay and growth are juxtaposed.<br>
<p>
The supposedly Balinese aphorism - "we have no art;<br>
we do everything as beautifully as we can" - works<br>
well for me.<br>
<p>
------------<br>
I wonder if the core of Objectivism could be<br>
abbreviated to Reality, Reason &amp; Romanticism?  John K<br>
Clark doesn't like the magic number 3 (Extropians<br>
debate with Tony Hollick a while back) but I always<br>
seem to find myself thinking with triplex Peircean<br>
logic :-)<br>
