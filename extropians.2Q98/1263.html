Hi, first i will try to apologies for my bad english, it's basically<br>
because my mother tongue is french, and i've never followed a lot of<br>
english courses in my scholarship. I've to add that my wordprocessor<br>
does not include any english dictionnary.<br>
<p>
I'm only a little student in nuclear engineering now, but i've a lot of<br>
interest for the subjects discussed here. Especially when it comes to<br>
talk about the physics of consciousness, nanotech, replicators,<br>
philosophy and implications for strong AI.<br>
<p>
I'm following this list since several months now and i'm rather<br>
surprised that only assemblers using nanotechnologies in their<br>
implementation are discussed here.<br>
<p>
Probably we could build a more "macroscopic" one. It will sure be less<br>
efficient than a nanotechnological one, but it's really worth to study<br>
too. I would like to see some reviews of the interesting ideas from Joe<br>
Michael at <a href="http://www.stellar.demon.co.uk/index.htm">http://www.stellar.demon.co.uk/index.htm</a> about Fractal Shape<br>
Changing Robots. The basic idea is so simple that i'm wondering how it<br>
can be possible that nobody come with that before. I think with<br>
enthousiasm that such kind of ideas are abble to make at least a major<br>
revolution in the automation field. Perhaps we could expect important<br>
breaktroughs in evolvable hardwares, AI too. If what he claims is at 50%<br>
possible, that will lead to a major revolution, the kind of revolution<br>
generally linked with nanotechnologies, but at a very minor cost.<br>
<p>
