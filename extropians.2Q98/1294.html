<i>&gt; And wouldn't</i><br>

This might protect Chuck, assuming that he can afford to (or can at all)<br>
develop his whatever-it-is in complete isolation.  In the long run,<br>
however, the problem of stealing is merely passed along to the buyer,<br>
who has invested heavily in the idea and now expects to profit from it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The current patent strategy is comparable to leaving your </i><br>
<i>&gt; front door open</i><br>
<i>&gt; and unlocked and putting out a big sign on your front lawn saying "No</i><br>
<i>&gt; trespassers.  Violators will be prosecuted."  This strategy </i><br>
<i>&gt; is more like</i><br>
<i>&gt; putting a LOCK on your door and putting a big sign on your lawn saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Just you TRY to get in.  Prosecutors will be violated."  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I don't see that this "Maginot line" strategy is any better than what's<br>
currently in place.  The current system seems to encourage the exchange<br>
of ideas but provides penalties for anyone who abuses this privilege.<br>
Your proposal would seem to discourage the exchange of ideas up front,<br>
and provide no recourse once someone broke your encryption.<br>
