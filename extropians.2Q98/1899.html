Just wanted to introduce myself... I'll be a lurker mainly, but more than<br>
happy to chat with extropians, transhumanists, cryonicists and "life-ists" in<br>
general -- then make a brief comment about the misprep of Extropy issue.<br>
(Please feel free to introduce yourself to me at my personal address...  don't<br>
thing the list would appreciate a long neverending "Hi Ed, welcome to the<br>
list" string !)   <br>
<p>
I'm Ed from Philly... been interested in "cryonics related issues" for about 8<br>
years after reading "Engines of Creation" and then "Man into Superman" - -<br>
Prior to going "trans" I'd been interested in humanism from the age of 13,<br>
when as a "then" Orthodox Jew I read Freud's "Moses and Monotheism" and gained<br>
the courage to get myself in trouble.  Hobbies are Jazz organ and travel<br>
(spend lot's of time in Tokyo) and contemporary Japan related stuff (not Zen<br>
and flower arranging !)...   I do curriculum design and ESL. I'm fascinated in<br>
social and psychological issues related to immortalist philosophies - - for<br>
example, given unlimited lifespan how man will have to redefine his/her vision<br>
of himself, family, what the new lifespan psychology will be and even the role<br>
fantasy and virtual reality might play in a distant future (i.e. would humans<br>
choose to create physical world of their dreams, or use technologies to create<br>
limitless alternative realities - - and how this would effect how humans<br>
interact in the future) - - and finally the "psychology of fatalism" and the<br>
way in which it shaped modern society and how/whether future humanity will be<br>
able to overcome it.<br>
<p>
- - Just a brief comment... so what if it's classified as a religion?   Right<br>
now cryonic preservation is illegal in many democratic countries and has been<br>
challenged in the U.S.   If a cryonics/transhumanist related organisation were<br>
to be deemed (even against its will) as a bonified religion, wouldn't that<br>
provide constitutional protection to the freezed and 'awantin' to be frozen<br>
folk ?    I definitely don't want my innards frozen out because some county<br>
sheriff or public figure is aspiring for higher grounds or has some kind of<br>
grudge to bare to the media.     Forgive my ignorance, but wouldn't the "rumor<br>
of religion" have a benefit to it - - even though "religion" to many of us<br>
goes against our basic principal as "technology" not the "supernatural" as<br>
saviour...   Must of us are pragmatists and utilitarians, aren't we ?<br>
