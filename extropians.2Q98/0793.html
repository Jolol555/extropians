<p>
There are few, if any, free markets today.  There will be few, if any, by<br>
sunrise tomorrow morning.  This does not demonstrate that there could not<br>
be or should not be a lot more free markets in the future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You</i><br>

<p>
Frankly, yes, and I'm not alone.  Yes, BECAUSE I'm not alone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;*Or* you just leave them</i><br>
<i>&gt;do anything they want to do and watch the world go to hell.</i><br>
<p>
Obviously, we don't think the world goes to hell when the people can have<br>
what they want.  Why?  Because people don't want their world to go to hell.<br>
 So instead they take steps to protect themselves from others who would<br>
harm them, and work with others to make their own lives better.  As a<br>
result, the world gets better, not worse, when people can do what they want.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is no freedom of mind, no</i><br>
<i>&gt;free will or whatever you call it. Decisions are dependant on information.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can make the masses think what you want if you got the media.</i><br>
<p>
Partly right, partly wrong.  I'm a soft-determinist: I think that you have<br>
free will if you do not know your own fate.  However, with respect to the<br>
media, CAN I actually make the masses think what I want, given control of<br>
the media?  It seems to me that in most places where the government has<br>
taken control of the media, most people don't believe the media, especially<br>
with respect to the government.  (Singapore leaps to mind.)  So I think<br>
you'd have to defend this a little better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then there's this strange desire for immortality, which I do not oppose but</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot understand. You get immortal through your deeds, not through your</i><br>
<i>&gt;biological existence. If you live forever but achieve little or nothing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;what's your immortality worth?</i><br>
<p>
My immortality is worth nothing if I don't do anything with it.  That's why<br>
none of us wants to become immortal and then do nothing forever.  :)<br>
Personally, I want to become immortal so I can do MORE "deeds" with my<br>
life, achieve more, build more.  I also doubt the meme that a well<br>
remembered dead man is not dead.  This is at best a misleading metaphor,<br>
and at worst a euphemism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then there's Extropy itself, the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;bringing order into the universe, colonizing space &amp; building up space</i><br>
<i>&gt;industry. Most of these ideas are either derivated from the false free</i><br>
<i>&gt;market meme or from old thinking (strive for room to live in, colonize other</i><br>
<i>&gt;continents).</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I know several anarcho-socialists who think it would be fun to<br>
visit Mars and to explore the rest of our galaxy, at least one of whom<br>
would like to build a city off planet.  Not because it's too crowded on<br>
earth or because there isn't enough here to live for, (I think there is, so<br>
do they,) but because it's an exciting idea.  This is not a free market<br>
phenomenon, nor is this the argument from overcrowding.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But if you do not even allow criticism on the list, these points will never</i><br>
<i>&gt;be discussed and revised for most Extropians.</i><br>
<p>
This is not the only place where I talk about extropianism, and I DO<br>
endorse criticism.  Why do you presume that whenever we try to have a<br>
positive conversation on extropy, we're trying to crush its critics?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you give me a tag to</i><br>
<i>&gt;include in messages criticizing Extropian thinking, I'd be happy.</i><br>
<p>
This bears some merit.  I recognize that this list is for positive<br>
discussion, but would it hurt much to change the policy, adding that people<br>
who want to criticize extropianism should have to add the subject prefix<br>
"ANTI:" to their posts?  <br>
