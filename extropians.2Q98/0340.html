RJ: &lt;This time difference is a function of the measuring mechanism itself. <br>
You are not saying that the Planck moment has changed during the flight,<br>
are you?  Is the Planck moment constant or is it not?<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;While I can't answer the point about the Plank moment, I can answer<br>
your<br>
point about the time difference being "a function of the measuring<br>
mechanism itself."  While this may actually be the case, this is NOT what<br>
is happening if you presume that light in a vacuum travels at the same<br>
speed in all reference frames.&gt;<br>
<p>
What exactly do you mean by "a vacuum"?  For instance, if the speed of<br>
light travels at different speeds depending on the density of space being<br>
traversed, how can we measure such differences since our measurements<br>
partake of the same density in the region in question?  Certainly, an<br>
observer outside the event horizon of a black hole observing the speed of<br>
light inside the event horizon would be hard put to not observe that the<br>
light velocity inside was approximately squat.  How does this change as the<br>
observer approaches the event horizon at a tangent?  If light is travelling<br>
lengthwise between two incredibly long, incredibly dense parallel plates,<br>
which screen out the bulk of the density of space, would not the speed of<br>
light increase over that outside of this system?  At the filamentary<br>
borders in deep space equidistant between all regional galactic<br>
superclusters, where the bulk of virtual particles are moving away from<br>
each other, is the speed of light increased over that of more dense space<br>
or are the photons dilated?  Is not the speed of light also dependent on<br>
the length of the Planck moment, which may be constant in our local region<br>
of the universe, but may be different in other regions?<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;I got most of the information here from _Fundamentals of Physics, 5th<br>
Edition_ by Halliday, Resnick and Walker. (Further reference upon<br>
request.)&gt;<br>
<p>
Halliday &amp; Resnick are fine by me, mine's sitting at arm's length.<br>
<p>
&lt;...it has also been observed that muons, which have an average lifetime of<br>
2.200 microseconds, have an average lifetime of 63.5 microseconds when<br>
moving at 0.9994c relating to the laboratory; precisely the value predicted<br>
by special relativity.&gt;<br>
<p>
And in regions of the universe where the Planck moment is approximately the<br>
constant it is in our region, when the muon achieves light speed, it lasts<br>
an eternity while spreading itself atemporally through every possible<br>
accessible place á la Russell's/Feynman's sum-over-the-histories.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;I have not rejected QM, I have simply noted that QM and Relativity are<br>
not reconciled, and they are not reconciled for a reason that science has<br>
not discovered yet.&gt;<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;Perhaps not, but the reason we accept both is because both theories<br>
predict the behavior of the world around us to as close as we can measure. <br>
One day we may find the true model, but until then we accept these models<br>
because they work.&gt;<br>
<p>
We accept the models knowing they are flawed.  Using models which work FAPP<br>
(for all practical purposes) without knowing why they work, without knowing<br>
the underlying reality that the mathematics correspond to, is fine for<br>
technicians.  Some horses prefer to move about without blinders on, though.<br>
 They want an explanation conjoined with description.  QM and Relativity<br>
require common explanations in order to reconcile them.  Usefulness is not<br>
knowledge, it is substantially lower down the scale.<br>
<p>
As to contradictory evidence for the Big Bang dogma, review the scientific<br>
literature over the past oh, three or four years, in particular much of the<br>
Hubble data interpretation, but also other cosmic-wide observations.  I<br>
read about plenty of confusing and contradictory interpretations.  The<br>
dogma isn't overthrown yet, something more fashionable hasn't arrived, but<br>
hopefully it will arrive, or if it doesn't, at least its adherents will not<br>
treat it as science.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Black holes are just like glaciers, if you want to free up the matter<br>
in them, just raise the background temperature around them.&gt;<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;This, however, is not true.  Remember that absolute speed of light<br>
constant, presumed above?  Well, as Bertozzi showed, increasing the kinetic<br>
energy STILL doesn't increase the speed faster than c; and since it<br>
doesn't, you STILL can't extract matter from a black hole, no matter how<br>
hot it gets.&gt;<br>
<p>
Even at background radiation levels, black holes are slowly melting at the<br>
event horizon, unless replenished with accreted matter from external<br>
sources.  As the temperature surrounding a black hole increases, the event<br>
horizon is made more permeable at the tangent to the horizon, the melting<br>
rate increases until the event horizon restablizes at a smaller radius<br>
until the surrounding temperature changes again.  Black holes are<br>
recyclable at a high enough technological level.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;biology makes no sense when it takes randomness (as in mutations) to<br>
be some ontological aspect, rather than an epistemological aspect.  If<br>
there was one ounce of ontological randomness in the universe, the universe<br>
would be entirely unintelligible.&gt;<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;Now you've gone and challenged all of QM, which has more experimental<br>
evidence behind it than I can shake a stick at.  What's with that?&gt;<br>
<p>
I have not challenged QM, only some kooky interpretations of it, of which<br>
there are many.  Experimental evidence is epistemological in nature, OK? <br>
The randomness in QM (or in evolutionary mutations) is epistemological in<br>
nature, not ontological.  Experiments and measurements are exercises in<br>
epistemology.  Generally, ontological presuppositions are made prior to<br>
constructing an experiment or taking a measurement.  Sometimes, these<br>
ontological presuppositions are altered post-measurement or<br>
post-experiment, but not very often.  An intelligible universe cannot<br>
contain ontological randomness, but it can contain bucketloads of<br>
epistemological randomness.<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;Information is a signal which reduces uncertainty.&gt;<br>
<p>
Reduces uncertainty for whom?<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;Most, if not all people who support abortion do NOT think that the<br>
fetus can be killed.&gt;<br>
<p>
Aside from the sheer erroneous nature of this claim, I would say, "how<br>
convenient."  I could just as easily claim, and with as much logic, that<br>
most people who support slavery do NOT think that slaves have full status<br>
with humans and can therefore be owned as property, like cattle or land, to<br>
be dispensed with arbitrarily.  Slavery and abortion are definitional<br>
issues, the same issue, in fact, the definition of human.<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;I could just as easily say that a person cannot be killed until they<br>
are born.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, you could.  If might makes right, then all is up for grabs, and may<br>
the best mafia don win.<br>
<p>
DF: &lt;To provide a logical argument, use COMMON definitions.  If two parties<br>
do not use definitions, you must use other common definitions to show why<br>
the other definitions are wrong.  But anyway you run it, we have to use<br>
premises upon which everyone agrees in order to have a logical discussion.<br>
<p>
I challenge you to prove, using definitions and premises upon which we both<br>
agree, that abortion is immoral; if you can't or won't, then don't try to<br>
have a logical argument with me.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is another form of the might makes right barbarian tyranny.  If you<br>
recall, the American Civil War was fought largely over defining what a<br>
human was.  No logical discussion between the North and the South was<br>
possible because they did not agree on common definitions and premises.  No<br>
utopia is ever possible anywhere, any time, because there are such<br>
conflicting ideals present in the world.  The abortion, infanticide, &amp;<br>
euthanasia fight will go on and on and on, ending up in either the elite<br>
accepting humane definitions of human, such as when Britain's elite<br>
abolished slavery without a war, or the elite will attempt to achieve<br>
consensus by neutralizing or eliminating opponents who hold conflicting<br>
definitions.  This is the tried and true method of tyranny.<br>
