Abstract<br>
  Average heights of adults and children in the counties of<br>
  England and Wales were examined using national samples of people born between<br>
  1920 and 1970. Although height increased over this 50-year<br>
  period the differences between counties persisted. Average<br>
  height in a county is closely related to its pattern of<br>
  death rates, which were derived from all deaths during 1968-78. Counties with<br>
  taller populations have lower mortality from chronic<br>
  bronchitis, rheumatic heart disease, ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and<br>
  higher mortality from three hormone-related cancers, of the<br>
  breast, prostate and ovary. The inverse relation of height<br>
  with bronchitis and cardiovascular disease is further evidence of risk<br>
  factors acting in early childhood. The positive relation between<br>
  height and cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate could<br>
  suggest that promotion of child growth has disadvantages as well as benefits.<br>
