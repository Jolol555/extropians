<p>
As a matter of fact, I've ordered that book a week or so ago (from<br>
<a href="http://www.altbookstore.com">http://www.altbookstore.com</a> btw; loompanics didn't seem to<br>
have it anymore). Right now, I only know about the Minerva<br>
reef settlers being kicked off by the king of Tonga (or something<br>
like that). You don't need any nukes to defend yourself from suckers<br>
like that, for example an old diesel sub with a couple of torpedoes<br>
would blow them out of the water in no-time. Or what about a remotely<br>
controlled plane with a couple of rockets and machine guns? Or a<br>
remotely controlled gunboat? Quite doable for the robotics guys in the<br>
transhuman community, I reckon. Then you can intercept the enemy as<br>
soon as they violate the 20 mile zone without being in direct physical<br>
danger. Nerds with joysticks kick ass. ;-) The most common threat are<br>
probably pirates, which are relatively lightly armed. They rather attack<br>
undefended freigters or pleasure jachts instead of islands with<br>
gun-toting pioneers. Unlike in any regular country, you can use<br>
virtually any means you want to defend yourself successfully, and *not*<br>
be arrested afterwards.<br>
<p>
Last but not least: because you're *at least* 200 miles from anywhere,<br>
it is quite unlikely that anyone will take the trouble to go over there,<br>
and kick your ass. Small countries simply don't have the means to do<br>
it, and big ones likely won't be interested And *should* they cause<br>
trouble after all, they're as vulnerable as anyone to retaliatory<br>
attacks (with for example the plague, anthrax, nerve gas or something<br>
more subtle) by the surviving islanders/their comrades in other<br>
countries. Only one needs to get trough...<br>
