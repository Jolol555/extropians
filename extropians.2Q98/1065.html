<i>&gt; From:          Bernard Hughes &lt;bjhughes@istar.ca&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Commerce would be by trading, buying, and selling the templates for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;controlling the manufacturing machines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I don't see that "commerce" is needed in an information society. As I see</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, commerce is you giving me some object or benefit in return for me</i><br>
<i>&gt; parting with some object or benefit. However, the unique thing about</i><br>
<i>&gt; information is, if I give it to you I don't part with it. So why should I</i><br>
<i>&gt; want something in return?</i><br>
<p>
To compensate for the work you put into acquiring the information <br>
and making it available.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Taking something from you is an extra hassle I can do without.</i><br>
<p>
That's a "transaction cost".  If the value to you does not exceed <br>
your transaction costs, you don't trade.  But often, it does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I think I do get something from you "automatically" if you take</i><br>
<i>&gt; information from me. I get your attention. And in an information based</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy, as others have pointed out, attention is the scarce resource.</i><br>
<p>
But of what value to you is that attention?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thats my personal experience on the Web and on mailing lists anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The problem is trading information for real objects and resources that</i><br>
<i>&gt; people have to part with for you to have them.</i><br>
<p>
Who said you had to trade information for real objects?  Why can't <br>
you trade information for information?  Information for time spent <br>
arranging and organizing information?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Being by nature lazy, I hope Dan is wrong about people wanting allows to</i><br>
<i>&gt; work. For myself, I find play more satisfying, and more creative in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; long run.</i><br>
<p>
For fun, I program computers.  Some people think of this as work -- <br>
in fact, they pay me for the privilege of dictating what my <br>
programming projects will be.<br>
