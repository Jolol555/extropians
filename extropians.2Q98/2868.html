You would have a angioplasty or bypass though, one would hope..<br>
<p>
	Look, if improvements in your physique, such as face lifts, hip replacements,<br>
cosmetic surgery, Chanel moisturizer,  or any other now-on-the-market-anti-<br>
aging methods actually interfere, in some scientifically-proven way, with<br>
some later medical breakthrough, OK.  I believe that is what the original post<br>
was inquiring about...<br>
	It did happen that certain AIDS medications *did* in fact preclude the use of<br>
later inhibitors, so it is possible...   but  I don't think letting your roots<br>
grow in grey or letting your skin sag has much to do -one way or the other-<br>
with life extension as I understand it.. as well, I think that the medically<br>
enduced efforts of a person to look young, feel young, and remain culturally<br>
attractive, can only enhance how one feels about one's self, enhancing one's<br>
sex life..  job opportunities... all that good stuff...<br>
my take on all of this is that life's length is not ultimately the goal, but<br>
it's quality and amount one can get out of it.  <br>
Plus it's promoting your self as a transhuman..<br>
I favor enhancements of quality and excellence of the human condition of all<br>
type, including surgery and artifice.<br>
