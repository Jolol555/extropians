Actually, it is rational to save others' lives if it improves the<br>
chances that you will be saved in a dangerous situation. There is a<br>
very interesting article in Nature June 11 about how cooperation<br>
emerges if individuals have an image dependent on their behavior. It<br>
turns out that it is rational to save even complete strangers you will<br>
never meet again if you will become known as a nice guy:<br>

   abstract = {Darwinian evolution has to provide an explanation for<br>
cooperative behaviour. Theories of cooperation are based on kin<br>
selection (dependent on genetic relatedness), group selection and<br>
reciprocal altruism. The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves<br>
direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals<br>
allow for the return of an altruistic act by the recipient. Here we<br>
present a new theoretical framework, which is based on indirect<br>
reciprocity and does not require the same two individuals ever to meet<br>
again. Individual selection can nevertheless favour cooperative<br>
strategies directed towards recipients that have helped others in the<br>
past. Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable<br>
community member to the cooperating individual. We present computer<br>
simulations and analytic models that specify the conditions required<br>
for evolutionary stability of indirect reciprocity. We show that the<br>
probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the<br>
cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act. We propose that the<br>
emergence of indirect reciprocity was a decisive step for the<br>
evolution of human societies.}  }<br>
