Of course not; it is a DEFINITION of what identity is.<br>

Correct: two different EXPRESSIONS of the SAME underlying thing.<br>
PLEASE give some attention to the distinction between the expression and<br>
the thing underlying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   So once again, two things are meaningfully</i><br>

<p>
By "meaningfully" I guess you mean "nontrivially".  Where the relation<br>
is identity, no two things are related; a nontrivial identity is a<br>
relation of two (or more) expressions or perceptions of the same thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   "2+3" and "5" are different expressions of</i><br>

<p>
Thanks.  ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   This tells us absolutely</i><br>
<i>&gt;   nothing about what identity is.</i><br>
<p>
What?!  A few sentences ago, you seemed to say that "2+3=5" *is* a<br>
meaningful example of identity.  Now you seem to say it's not.<br>
<p>
You challenged me to give a meaningful example of identity.<br>
I return the challenge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; and a theory of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; tells us what identity is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But that's circular. Since identity is a symbolic construct - you can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;go out and dig up rocks and find an "identity" - identity can only be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;what it is defined to be; a theory follows from the definitions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: Identity is what a thing is;</i><br>
<p>
You must be very brave to stand up in public and say that "A=A" is<br>
meaningless while "the identity of A is A" is not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   wether rock,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   symbol, or idea, all things have an identity.</i><br>
<p>
What does it mean to "have" an identity?<br>
<p>
Apparently you deny my statement "identity is a symbolic construct - you<br>
can't go out and dig up rocks and find an `identity'".  If I understand<br>
you here, every thing is its own identity: this clock is the identity of<br>
this clock, the Pachelbel Canon is the identity of the Pachelbel Canon. <br>
This suggests that "identity" has no *general* meaning, only innumerable<br>
*particular* meanings.  Must be awfully hard to theorize about it.<br>
<p>
Again: you confound the mathematical sense of identity (the relation of<br>
a thing with itself) with the vernacular sense (the sum of a thing's<br>
attributes?).  In the mathematical sense, everything "has" the same<br>
identity - that is, for every thing, "identity" has the same meaning (I<br>
am identical to myself, and you are identical to yourself); in the<br>
vernacular sense, "identity" is different for each thing (I'm Chevy<br>
Chase and you're not).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Simply saying that A is the same as A tells</i><br>
<i>&gt;   us nothing about what identity is.</i><br>
<p>
Too bad, because that is the (mathematical) DEFINITION of identity.<br>
Like it or not, the word _identity_ was coined from the Latin word<br>
_idem_ meaning `same'.  Sameness is the defining element of identity.<br>
If you don't like it, coin another word, or use one of the many words<br>
available, such as description, distinction, attributes, qualities.<br>
<p>
All I ask of you, Ian, all I have ever asked of you in this dispute, is<br>
that you refrain from stealing for your concept a word which others have<br>
adopted for a very different well-defined concept.  No, even less than<br>
that: I don't care if you misuse a word for your purposes; I object only<br>
to your insisting that others, who had it first, are wrong in their use<br>
of the word.<br>
<p>
&lt;analogy&gt;<br>
The ancients used the word _planets_ to mean Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus,<br>
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.  We have since found it more useful to<br>
subtract the Sun from that list and add Earth.  But our new definition<br>
does not make theirs wrong; they were using the word in a different<br>
sense.  It would be foolish to go through old writings and attach a<br>
gloating correction to each passage where the Sun is called a "planet". <br>
The Sun *is* a planet in the older sense: a bright body which appears to<br>
move against the background of the distant stars.  When the new usage<br>
came along, it was specialized at first; it was wrong to use the word<br>
_planet_ in the new sense without explaining that it was being used in a<br>
special way.  Centuries later, the context has changed: nobody but<br>
astrologers now have any interest in "planets" in the old sense, and now<br>
it is they who must explain their special usage.<br>
&lt;/analogy&gt;<br>
<p>
If your theory has merit, eventually most of us will forget the<br>
etymological meaning of _identity_.  I concede the remote possibility --<br>
but it is still arrogant of you to behave as if that has already<br>
happened.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; "A=A+~A," is never shown to be false.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because it is vacuous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; IAN: But the statement "A=A" is not??!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Nope. "A=A" distinguishes A from that which is not A. "A=A+~A" does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not: since A+~A is the whole universe, A+~A = B+~B for any B, thus A=B</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for any A,B; any two things are equal to each other. Thus, as you say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;this relation can never be false.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: So (A=A) = (B=B), thus A=B.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by posting this (invalid) syllogism; is it<br>
meant as a reductio ad absurdum, somehow, of my previous statement<br>
(using your definition, A = A+~A = B+~B = B), or do you concede the<br>
truth of my statement, and mean here to show that my definitions lead to<br>
an equally silly result?<br>
<p>
That your syllogism is invalid can be shown by Boolean truth-tables:<br>
<p>
	A	B	A=A		B=B		(A=A)=(B=B)		A=B<br>
<p>
	F	F	 T 		 T 		     T     		 T<br>
	F	T	 T 		 T 		     T     		 F<br>
	T	F	 T 		 T 		     T     		 F<br>
	T	T	 T 		 T 		     T     		 T<br>
<p>
(The next-to-last column is always true because "T=T" is true.)<br>
<p>
With my definition of identity, "_=_" is sometimes true and sometimes<br>
false, depending on what's in the blanks, so there's something special<br>
about "A=A" which is always true.<br>
<p>
With your definition(?) of identity, "_=_" is always true; so no use of<br>
"=" can ever say anything distinctive, nonvacuous.<br>
