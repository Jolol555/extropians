<i>&gt; From:          Max More &lt;maxmore@primenet.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm only going to comment on this point. Erik: Recently, the wages of</i><br>
<i>&gt; workers has been rising. However, over the last couple of decades, if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; exclude other forms of income and wealth, the inflation-adjusted incomes of</i><br>
<i>&gt; workers with few skills has indeed been stagnant. Is that the fault of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; market? I would say no. Why?</i><br>
<p>
Taxes have skyrocketed.<br>
<p>
The majority of inflation is in those industries most affected by <br>
government intervention, e.g. medicine and post-high-school <br>
education.  Since these industries are generally seen as not being a <br>
major part of day-to-day life, people willingly accept wage increases <br>
that match inflation in the *rest* of the economy.<br>
<p>
The demand for "workers with few skills" is declining.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Today's economy increasingly rewards those with skills, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; "symbolic" skills such as computer programming, language skills, legal</i><br>
<i>&gt; expertise, etc. While, in the USA, less skilled workers have made no</i><br>
<i>&gt; progress over a couple of decades, at least they are employed. In European</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries, the very same factors are at work, but the result is high and</i><br>
<i>&gt; persistent unemployment.</i><br>
<p>
That's to be expected.  If the demand for unskilled workers is <br>
declining relative to the supply, the natural wages of unskilled <br>
workers will (not may, not might, not could possibly -- WILL) fall.  <br>
There are three ways this can be expressed: (1)  spreading <br>
a reduced total wage over a similar number of workers, giving each <br>
one lower wages; (2) keep the wage of each employed worker up, but <br>
lay off a bunch of workers; (3) use armed force to transfer some <br>
wealth to the pool available for unskilled workers, keeping their <br>
wages and numbers up simultaneously -- by decreasing the wages, or <br>
the number, of better-paid workers.<br>
<p>
Minimum-wage laws, of course, prohibit option (1) from going beyond a <br>
certain point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In our case, I would argue that the fault is not the market. Partly it may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be an inevitable result of differences among humans and their abilities and</i><br>
<i>&gt; culturally-influenced preferences (such that some refuse to learn the</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary skills). But much of it I would say results from a poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; educational system that is weak at motivating students, lacks innovation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and fails to instill important skills. (I *know* this goes on because I</i><br>
<i>&gt; teach students entering college who almost all lack logical skills, basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; math, and any semblance of scientific education.) </i><br>
<p>
That too.  Increasing the supply of unskilled workers at the same <br>
time that the demand for them is decreasing, doesn't seem the most <br>
sensible action.<br>
<p>
Not to worry, though -- friends and acquaintances who hire unskilled <br>
workers, report that a high percentage of recent high-school <br>
graduates don't even deserve to be called "workers".  They are so <br>
unprepared for the reality of the workplace that they will need a <br>
substantial amount of remedial education before they are prepared to <br>
matriculate at Hamburger University.<br>
<p>
(Start with the day a manager at a local burger joint had two <br>
interviews scheduled, both for 9 AM, and a new employee supposed to <br>
start at the same time. Was she overbooking her time?  Not to worry.  <br>
Of the three, only one showed up.  One of the people to be <br>
interviewed.  Fifteen minutes late.  The manager, from experience, <br>
EXPECTED only one person to show up.)<br>
