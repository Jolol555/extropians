Recently I visited the LA's Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) to view an<br>
exhibition of "Action Art" (1950s - 1970s).   The exhibition consisted of<br>
archival videos, writings, installations, and photographs of performances<br>
and sculpture. While Action Art lasted only two decades, it did pave the<br>
way for Performance Art which paved the way for our Transhumanist Extropic<br>
Art known as "Automorph Art."<br>
<p>
If you aren't familiar with Action Art, let me be briefly explain.  Action<br>
Art began with Jackson Pollock's radical method of paintings where he<br>
literally flung the oil painting off the canvas.  This became a statement<br>
of that art can reach beyond the edges of a canvas or the edge of a<br>
theatrical stage - beyond the confines of its form. <br>
<p>
Some example of Action Art are by Manzoni (Italy) who signed naked bodies<br>
of people and then exhibited them as living sculpture; Yves Klein (France)<br>
who authored political and social statements on blackboards and then sold<br>
them as art works; and Joseph Beuys who created the Free University as a<br>
multidisciplinary informational network which he called "social sculpture";<br>
and also Allan Kaprow who is known for authoring _The blurring of  art and<br>
life.<br>
<p>
The legacy left by Action Art brought about an "acute awareness among<br>
artists" giving its viewers a sample of "humanity as a work of art." There<br>
were a few pieces that I favored at MOMA - the outrageous frankness of<br>
Carolee Schneemann (known for pulling a 4 ' scroll out of her vagina and<br>
reading it on stage (I did see her perform this in 1976 at the Telluride<br>
Film Festival (1977))).  There were mementos of moments in art history -<br>
moments where creative minds raced past the confines of tradition and<br>
proclaimed each moment of their existence worthy of recording.<br>
<p>
Remember, this was in the 1950s - 1970s and these artists were<br>
experimenting with their consciousness and their bodies.  There was little<br>
evidence of  bio-technology or interfacing with robotics. There was little<br>
concern with indefinite lifespans.  There was little interest in enhancing<br>
or augmenting intelligence. These artists exhibited their emotions - as raw<br>
and exposed as they could - as if shouting to the World - "Come see me -<br>
see who I am naked in my mundane life!"  Action Art shunned society's<br>
covering up of thoughts (censorship) and the covering of the body (moralism).<br>
<p>
Clearly, nakedness is not new to art, as evidenced in any art history<br>
colorplate.  Genitals are exhibited in plain view in the painting of<br>
"Madonna and Child" or Michelangelo rendered penises on the ceiling of the<br>
Sistine Chapel.  Exploitative sex is visible in Hieronymus Bosch's "Garden<br>
of Delights," (1500s).  Yet, soon the penis was morally covered with a<br>
symbolic fig leaf and culture turned away from gawking at naked bodies on<br>
display in their venerated, adorned and even "divined" creations.  <br>
<p>
Indeed, Action Art was a sincere "Kick In The Ass" to humanity's moralism;<br>
yet, Action Art wasn't pretty or particularly inviting.  In fact,<br>
retrospectively it looked real dim to me.  If this genre symbolized the<br>
"every day life of humanity" while shinning a light upon it -- How very dim<br>
the bulb.  <br>
<p>
Glad that my own work was not chosen for this particular exhibition, I<br>
thought about the brilliant light of optimism and innovation shinning on<br>
our transhumanity and that the art/science of our early transhuman efforts.  <br>
<p>
Our incandescent "Kick Off" to transhumanity's potential may be exhibited<br>
decades from now.<br>
