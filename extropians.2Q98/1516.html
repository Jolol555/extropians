<p>
While I agree with you about that human-computer collaborations are<br>
the most likely path towards SI, I'm not entirely sure about the<br>
supercooled liquid analogy. <br>
<p>
Overall I am very sceptical of all claims that a single breakthrough<br>
will produce a sudden singularity-like bootstrapping process that<br>
leaves everybody but the initiator in the dust. There have been no<br>
such events in the past, and even if we discuss intelligence<br>
amplification techniques (which we so far have not had much experience<br>
with) it is not clear that a given IA invention will make it much<br>
easier to make even stronger IA devices.<br>
<p>
And even if the device helps you make better such devices it might<br>
turn out that this is limited by other constraints; for example the<br>
human-software design system might quickly bootstrap to a level where<br>
the user interface becomes the bottleneck, and further expansion<br>
requires intelligence amplification in the service of the<br>
human-computer interaction field instead. Most technologies seem to be<br>
dependent on other technologies to reach their true potential, and<br>
improving these might require even more work further afield.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that a reall SI bootstraping process requires a width<br>
of knowledge and skill that is not available in a small<br>
group. Remember the car analogy: there is no single human able to<br>
build a car from scratch, since that process involves mining<br>
technology, refining, aerodynamics, metalworking, semiconductor design<br>
and engineering, electronics, chemistry... and so on - but the<br>
industrial web contains enough knowledge distributed between thousands<br>
of people to do it. To make a true SI, we might need software<br>
engineering, HCI, hardware design, economics, theory of complex<br>
systems, psychology, neuroscience, nanotechnology and Turing knows<br>
what else. And we might need a lot of it, not just a single expert for<br>
every field hired by the would-be-SI team, but a whole community<br>
testing out different solutions and working in parallel. <br>
<p>
With IA technologies and an emerging &gt;Web, this could become a<br>
historically very fast process, but it would likely still take a few<br>
years (practical physical delays in building new hardware, costly<br>
mistakes, the problem that people tend to sleep 1/3 of the time<br>
etc). I don't buy the idea that a single technology will bootstrap its<br>
lone inventor to godhood the day after he discovers it (makes a great<br>
sf story though; I recall writing something like that in the third<br>
grade, where a group of children bootstrap themselves to world<br>
domination in roughly the &gt;Web way), but that doesn't mean I don't<br>
think the &gt;Web concept has merit. Seen from a distance in time and<br>
space, it might very well look like a small fraction of humanity<br>
transcends almost immediately, but close up it will be a wide movement<br>
involving plenty of people (definitely more than a few thousand) and<br>
work.<br>
<p>
<p>
Perhaps a better discussion would be how we *practically* immanentize<br>
the transcension? :-)<br>
