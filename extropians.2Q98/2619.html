<p>
Your own decisions about what is ethical or not is what makes it so. How well<br>
you do in life, whether it be a small part of your life or the whole schpiel, is<br>
a measure of the effectiveness of the ethics you do develop. This isn't to say<br>
that someone living in poverty their whole life has poor ethics, on the<br>
contrary, though their own ethics may preclude them from measuring success from<br>
a materialist perspective. However, one can note that the average life<br>
expectancy, lifetime and annual earning potential, average stress level and<br>
average happiness level of people which most would regard as having poor ethics,<br>
i.e. criminals, is far far lower than those as a whole than those people who<br>
most would regard as having good ethics.<br>
<p>
Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule, as with any bell curve, as<br>
well as fields of endeavor where ethics that most people would regard as good<br>
would be a hindrance to success, like in the fields of politics, law, car sales,<br>
etc. If one enjoys one of these occupations, you do of course need to form your<br>
own ethics which may be considered bad to most people, but which are effective<br>
for your own occupation or lifestyle...<br>
<p>
Ethics are nothing more than a set of rules you create for yourself for getting<br>
through life. If they work for you, great. If you have no ethics, and you aren't<br>
quite happy with the results of living opportunistically, try creating a few<br>
purposely.<br>
<p>
BTW: Nobody can be said to have no ethics, save for a newborn babe....<br>
