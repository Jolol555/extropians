But won't this same technology also blur the distinction between people<br>
and the other categories?  What happens when someone alters his DNA to<br>
make himself more like an animal?  Or what happens when he incorporates<br>
computer parts into his brain, or uploads and adds parts of his mentality<br>
to AI systems?  I don't see how you are going to be able to draw the line<br>
you want to draw.<br>
<p>
I could see having some test for intelligence in order to have rights,<br>
since that could conceivably be made objective, but it seems impossible<br>
to have a meaningful test for "humanness".<br>
