<i>&gt;   IAN: So "some cults are negative" and you think</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "extropian ideas are negative," therefore ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is a cult. Supported further by the fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ExI holds regular meetings, and therefore per-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   forms "rituals." Why bother with such strained</i><br>
<i>&gt;   argumentation to achieve an insult? Just argue</i><br>
<i>&gt;   over the philosophical principles.  The insult</i><br>
<i>&gt;   thing is just an ad hominem variety of counter.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You should separate the "cult" discussion from the "principles" discussion.<br>
As I've already written in a private mail to Anders, I am a very lingual<br>
thinker and prefer to use the correct words. And I still think that the word<br>
"cult" applies to the ExI. It doesn't have anything to do with whether the<br>
ExI is positive or negative, it just means using the right terms to describe<br>
things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   BTW, your comments on the "optimism" post were</i><br>
<i>&gt;   very enlightening and wise.  My revolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;   style is exactly what I've felt is reckless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   But I have trouble breaking out of it. Full</i><br>
<i>&gt;   frontal attacks on a cover-up may in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;   only make it dig its heels in deeper.??</i><br>
<p>
I have followed your analysis of the TWA-800 cover-up and forwarded it to my<br>
friends. It was certainly interesting, but on the other hand, you have to<br>
ask yourself what you can achieve with this kind of information? Of course,<br>
you have to understand power structures -- but although I have much<br>
information about the JFK "incident", I will not try to convince anybody<br>
that the CIA are a bunch of killers, liars and generally evil guys. How<br>
could that possibly help anyone?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Maybe you should also consider such with</i><br>
<i>&gt;   respect to your attacks on Extropianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The way to change things is to work with</i><br>
<i>&gt;   them, not to insult and demolish them.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I am sorry if you feel like I do. I have to admit that my reply to Max was a<br>
bit feverish (especially the "leader" part), and the only thing I can say to<br>
justify that is that I only had 5 hours of sleep and don't like it when<br>
people say that I haven't understood anything. But I don't think that my<br>
last postings were irrational or abusive.<br>
