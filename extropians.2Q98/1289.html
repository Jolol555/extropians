<i>&gt; Since *any* publisher can do this, the *first* publisher will pay no </i><br>
<i>&gt; more than his anticipated first day sales, minus the cost of setting </i><br>
<i>&gt; up the production run and a reasonable profit.  Let's assume it's a </i><br>
<i>&gt; massively advertised book from a major author.  An expected best </i><br>
<i>&gt; seller.  Put that in real terms: an expected best-seller paperback </i><br>
<i>&gt; has a first-print run of a million copies or less for the US, which </i><br>
<i>&gt; print run is expected to last for three months.  So figure 100,000 </i><br>
<i>&gt; copies on the first day.  (As it happens, 100,000 is also a common </i><br>
<i>&gt; size print run.)  The publisher sells the books for, say, $2 each, so </i><br>
<i>&gt; he gets $200,000.  He's spent $100,000 advertising it, and $75,000 on </i><br>
<i>&gt; printing and distribution.  Since he gets *all* the risk, he wants </i><br>
<i>&gt; most of the profit.  So the author gets $5,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember, this is an expected best-seller from a major author.  And </i><br>
<i>&gt; this is ALL the author will ever get for writing that book.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Today, if you have never sold a novel before and a publisher offers </i><br>
<i>&gt; you a $5,000 advance, you should probably keep looking for a </i><br>
<i>&gt; publisher.</i><br>
<p>
The number of completely groundless assumptions in this analysis<br>
are too many to count.  First, the idea that the author only makes<br>
money from sales of his book is idiotic.  He is much more valuable<br>
than that; he can sell his presence, his expertise, his skill,<br>
the consumer attention of his name, /and/ his labor in a thousand<br>
other ways that authors today don't take advantage of because<br>
their publishers are too lazy and unimaginative to see them.  A<br>
second assumption is that the startup cost to a second publisher<br>
is minimal; that too isn't true, because in a world without the<br>
problem of copyright, authors will seek the publisher that can<br>
produce works most efficently, or those who have consumer respect<br>
and attention that their competitors lack, so the risk of<br>
competition is lessened.  A third assumption is that the second<br>
publisher will have no use for the author's services, but will<br>
just reprint the original work.  A business that stupid would<br>
last about five minutes.  Consumers want the latest, the best;<br>
they want information customized to their needs.  The author is<br>
in the best position to do that, even after initial publication.<br>
What makes you think the idea of "books" as the preferred medium<br>
of information sales is even a good idea to begin with?<br>
<p>
Anytime people claim that a law is "necessary", what they really<br>
mean is that they don't have the imagination to see how the free<br>
market would solve the same problem--if a problem exists--or<br>
else they don't have the courage to do it in the free market.<br>
<p>
Copyrights do nothing but reward duplication and mediocrity at<br>
the expense of true creativity and artistry.  Patents do nothing<br>
but reward pointless novelty at the expense of workmanship and<br>
quality.  Writers and inventors should not be afraid of losing<br>
their jobs to their abolition--they should cheer for losing their<br>
jobs, and being freed to use their talents more profitably in<br>
a thousand other ways that the laws have stifled for too long.<br>
<p>
Your argument, like many others in this subject, is in the form<br>
of "The current system has X, Y, Z, A, B, and C; and books get<br>
published, movies are made, etc.  Without copyright, you can't<br>
do Y and B, therefore no books will be made, no songs recorded,<br>
and authors will beg in the streets."  Nonsense.  In a new world<br>
without copyrights, we lose Y and B, but we gain D, E, F, P, Q,<br>
and R, and the whole industry changes, adapts to the new model.<br>
Writers will be no less creative, consumers will no less desire<br>
their services, and more--not less--money will be made, but it<br>
will be made in very different ways that today's publishers<br>
just don't have to brains to imagine or the courage to do.<br>
