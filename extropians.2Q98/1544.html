<p>
We know empirically that in such tasks people mostly select numbers on the<br>
basis of simple algorithms that have nothing to do with `hunches' - the<br>
`lucky' numbers in their astrological charts, the days of the month of<br>
their kids' or other loved ones' birthdays, etc.  This creates a composite<br>
background profile of preferences that is staggeringly stable from week to<br>
week (it varies a little when there's a jackpot draw that either brings in<br>
some fresh blood or encourges regulars to buy extra tickets and vary their<br>
chosen picks).   Perhaps the most intriguing finding in my study is that<br>
people by and large *can't* be following evanescent `hunches', because<br>
their behaviour is so rote.  People might be prey to magical thinking, but<br>
evidently this take the form of a kind of blurry background metaphysics<br>
rather than an intentional effort to change or perceive the world by<br>
psychic means - at least in lotteries.<br>

perfect         <br>

<p>
<i>&gt;If it's difficult to predict the winning lottery number that are determined </i><br>
<i>&gt;by only 6 simple events then how can it predict earthquakes , the rise and </i><br>
<i>&gt;fall of empires, the weather, and the stock market</i><br>
<p>
(1) a catastrophic earthquake, or bad weather for the picnic, or a market<br>
slump, are each encodable as just one bit of data. <br>
<p>
(2) I don't recall offering to predict the rise and fall of any empires<br>
other than the Galactic Empire.  :)<br>
<p>
(3) You could in principle precognise the winning lottery numbers as a<br>
single string of 12 decimal numbers, or perhaps as a strikingly mnemonic<br>
graphic pattern on the entry form, but surely it makes best sense to<br>
imagine that psi (if it exists) has to modify each discrete choice as it's<br>
ticked or crossed off on the form.  <br>
<p>
The sense I have of psi's functioning, from reports of lab work, is that<br>
it's akin to looking up at a blackboard that might be illuminated<br>
stochastically for half a second every minute.  If you happen to be looking<br>
when the winning number is posted, your behaviour can be shifted; otherwise<br>
you're in the dark with everyone else, making guesses based on internal<br>
pseudo-random algorithms (which are notoriously biased and repetitive).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the USA you can win about 10$ if you guess 3 out of the 6 numbers in any  </i><br>
<i>&gt;order, the number of these small winners is in the millions and the number</i><br>
is <br>
<i>&gt;just what you'd expect if the psi effect was zero.</i><br>
<p>
Good point.  But how do you know the outcomes are random?  They can't<br>
possibly *look* random on any short timescale, for the reasons I've given -<br>
collective preferences must mean that in draws where popular numbers happen<br>
to be targets, many more winners will be generated than by pure chance<br>
expectation, and the reverse when mostly unpopular numbers come up.  And<br>
the effects we're looking for are probably marginal at best, because if<br>
they were not we'd be running our communications systems on psi rather than<br>
EM.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't demand that the psi effect be </i><br>
<i>&gt;explained, I just want it proven to exist, and after a century of trying to </i><br>
<i>&gt;do this the progress has been precisely zilch, the evidence stunk then and</i><br>
it <br>
<i>&gt;stinks now.</i><br>
<p>
As Radin points out, this is the expression of a skepticism uninformed by<br>
current evidence (from the last two decades, say).  John, I believe you<br>
mentioned that you've never heard of PEAR, one of the major<br>
academically-affiliated anomalies research programs in the world.  Even Dr<br>
Ray Hyman, prime CSICOP debunker, admits that the latest batches of<br>
ganzfeld studies show that *something* unexplained in afoot.  He doesn't<br>
think it can be psi, because he argues that psi as classically propounded<br>
is inconsistent with QT, relativity, etc.  (Nobel physics laureate Brian<br>
Josephson disagrees with him, as it happens.)  But he doesn't know what<br>
*is* happening to cause these repeatable, non-null-hypothesis effects.  <br>
<p>
If you're gonna diss the field, bro, you gotta get out there and dip your<br>
toe in the murky water.<br>
