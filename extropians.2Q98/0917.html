I've recently read a book written  by Ken Wilber that does a very good job of attempting<br>
to recouncile this battle  between  science and  religion. The  book  is called 'Sense<br>
and soul'.  If you find this book to be<br>
of interest as I did you might take a shot at reading 'Science, sex and ecology'<br>
by the same author.<br>
<p>
I would like to hear what the 'extropian' view of his<br>
work is, so please, do comment. (Does anyone have any<br>
views on A.G.E. Blake's 'The intelligent enneagram'?)<br>
<p>
I want to take this time to mention that this extropy<br>
"cult"  exhibits  the  most  positive  and  realistic approach to addressing  our<br>
 future  that  I've  come across yet.  <br>
<p>
Also 'cult' tends  to  connote a  kind of  worship, a reliance on faith (unempirical),<br>
I  have not observed this  behavior in 'extropianers'. But I have observed  a  kind<br>
 of  religious fervor  in  the opposition  of extropian views... (;<br>
