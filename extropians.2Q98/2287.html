<i>&gt; So much about the better ability of a centralized planning system</i><br>

Considering that much of the Army thinking/mindset is still oriented toward<br>
cavalry/infantry/artillery, that is retained from the 19th century, I'd expect<br>
that they wouldn't have any serious y2k problems till at least 2100.....;)<br>
<p>
All of our nations strategic nuke capability is in both the USAF or the Navy's<br>
hands, so even if one of those is not prepared (I don't know about the navy, I<br>
do know that the USAF has been well prepared) the other should be able to handle<br>
the load....<br>
<p>
Seriously, most military systems do not depend upon actual clocks that measure a<br>
two digit year as is the problem with much COBOL programming. They typically use<br>
simple counting circuits or programs that can be reset without loss of<br>
capability.<br>
