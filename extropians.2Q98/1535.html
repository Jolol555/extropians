<p>
Haven't checked it out yet.  So what follows is based on my<br>
views influenced by other sources.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There, under METAPHYSICS, Gardner says:</i><br>
<i>&gt;"The things we observe with our senses are real and</i><br>
<i>&gt;primary; the contents of our minds -- ideas and</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotions -- are secondary, and have no independent</i><br>
<i>&gt;validity unless they correspond to the facts of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;outside world."</i><br>
<p>
I question his "no independent validity" though I think I<br>
agree with him.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This sounds reasonable; but, being naturally playful,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I like to invert this somewhat and propose:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our sensation of and embodied interaction with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world is real and primary; there are no independent</i><br>
<i>&gt;objects and theories apart from this interaction.</i><br>
<p>
If you accept that things which interact must because<br>
they interact be somehow independent -- otherwise,<br>
they would not need to interact; they'd be part of the<br>
same whole -- then things come before sensations of<br>
things.  Theories are a different story.  They would not<br>
be independent on this model but based upon things,<br>
albeit indirectly through experience of things.<br>
<p>
This does not make them less valid -- any more so than my<br>
inability to observe the idea of "color" -- I can only see<br>
the various things which have particular colors, such<br>
as the light green of my copy of _Independent Review_<br>
sitting on my bed -- makes it an invalid idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Looking under EPISTEMOLOGY (Gardner is referencing:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rand, _Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_):</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Animals can only know what trees they have seen in</i><br>
<i>&gt;their lifetime; because of concepts, man can reach</i><br>
<i>&gt;basic conclusions about all trees -- including those</i><br>
<i>&gt;he has never seen."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I wonder how Objectivists can know this so certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt;about animals and other humans!  What kind of "basic</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclusion" would I want to reach about a tree that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;had never seen?  If I was a person indigenous to an</i><br>
<i>&gt;environment near the Arctic circle and had only seen</i><br>
<i>&gt;an occasional evergreen tree I might erroneously</i><br>
<i>&gt;decide that deciduous trees of lower latitudes were</i><br>
<i>&gt;not trees at all.</i><br>
<p>
The conclusion made about nonhuman animals, though<br>
sound to me, sounds like a leap.  I've read of studies,<br>
such as _How Monkeys See the World_, which might<br>
be interpreted as some species of monkeys having<br>
a rudimentary (if very limited) ability to form concepts.<br>
<p>
As for the Northern botanist you posit, she might form a<br>
concept of "tree" based solely on evergreens, then<br>
form another concept, let's say "abu," that corresponds<br>
to our "deciduous tree," then come to see "tree" and<br>
"abu" share lots of important similarities that "tree" and<br>
"grass" (or "abu" and "fern") don't share and form<br>
another concept "blok" that subsumes both.<br>
<p>
The problem here is that concepts need not always be<br>
formed the same way.  Given different contexts, different<br>
sets of concepts apply.  It's been reported that Inuits<br>
have many words for snow and ice, moreso than the<br>
short list I've learned living in the USA.  Does that mean<br>
that the Inuit concepts clash with mine?  Hardly.  It<br>
merely means that they live in a place where such<br>
differentiations are more important than they are in<br>
mine.  (If I'm lucky, I see snow and ice about three<br>
months out the year.)  This does not expose any fatal<br>
flaws for Objectivist epistemology -- any more than it<br>
would for any other flavor of epistemology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, this seems somewhat contradictory to what follows</i><br>
<i>&gt;(which I basically agree with):</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Induction is merely one half of the process of</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought; true knowledge must not only be based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;observed facts of reality, it must integrate in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-contradictory manner with all one's other</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge." In practice, I usually manage to</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplish this well enough to survive and thrive. </i><br>
<p>
Well, epistemology can be approached as a perscriptive<br>
or a descriptive discipline.  As the former, it would offer<br>
rules of evidence and justification to arrive at knowledge.<br>
For the latter, we have to recognize that people arrived<br>
at knowledge long before they starting inquiring into the<br>
proper means.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In principle, though (that is, in thought), I find</i><br>
<i>&gt;this impossible, and am often perturbed by seemingly</i><br>
<i>&gt;contradictory concepts (like metaphorical Baobab</i><br>
<i>&gt;trees with their 'roots' in the air).</i><br>
<p>
Or hydroponics?:)  Such seeming contradictions should<br>
not be hard on a robust epistemology, especially one<br>
which seeks to understand the universe -- as opposed to<br>
fit it into a preconceived scheme.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, Rand's epistemology is logic.  There seem to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;several types of logic, however.  Some excellent</i><br>
<i>&gt;discourse on these, conducted over a century ago by</i><br>
<i>&gt;Charles S. Peirce, is 'still' available online at</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://www.peirce.org">http://www.peirce.org</a> (cf., "Questions Concerning</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certain Faculties Claimed for Man", "On a New List of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Categories", and "Some Consequences of Four</i><br>
<i>&gt;Incapacities" - looking briefly at these again, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;last one looks especially relevant to debates about</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objectivism).</i><br>
<p>
I've only read a bit of Peirce and found him, on the whole,<br>
quite agreeable.  I'll have to look into this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Regarding ETHICS, bouncing back to Gardner's ORG page</i><br>
<i>&gt;on this, the first thing I see is: "Valuing is solely</i><br>
<i>&gt;an attribute of animate matter. Inanimate matter</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot act, because it has nothing to act for;</i><br>
<i>&gt;although its form can change, matter itself cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt;destroyed, i.e., go out of existence."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Just for fun, I'd like to contrast this with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;following excerpt from William T. Powers' essay "The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Origins Of Purpose: The First Metasystem Transitions"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Powers has been developing perceptual control</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems since the early 1950s; this essay is</i><br>
<i>&gt;available at</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="ftp://ftp.vub.ac.be/pub/projects/Principia_Cybernetica/WF-issue/Powers.txt">ftp://ftp.vub.ac.be/pub/projects/Principia_Cybernetica/WF-issue/Powers.txt</a>):</i><br>
<i>&gt;"In a control-system model, a purpose is simply a</i><br>
<i>&gt;reference signal... The purpose of a control system,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the final analysis, is to control some effect of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the environment on it, via its sensors, around a</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific state or condition or level... This concept</i><br>
<i>&gt;of purpose, of course, does not entail any cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;abilities or any ability to symbolize the purpose, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;think about it. It is simply an inherent property of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a control system, whether simple or complex."  Powers</i><br>
<i>&gt;gives an interesting example of how even molecules in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a solution can comprise a very simple control system.</i><br>
<p>
There does seem to be a difference, though, between<br>
a control system in general and a living system.  The<br>
living one, after all, evolved in such a way that it's<br>
self-control furthers its existence.  For example, a<br>
plant's ability to turn its leaves to the light helps it to<br>
live, while my car's cruise control's ability to keep the<br>
car going at a steady speed does not.  The latter's<br>
existence is indifferent to whether it achieves its goal<br>
or not.  The former's existence depends on it.<br>
<p>
I think a big part of being alive has to do with one's<br>
actions having an impact on living.  Surely, an<br>
organism whose actions did not affect its ability to<br>
survive would be unlike any organism we know of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Powers' conclusion here, I think, is worth quoting:</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Knowing control theory, we can freely use such terms</i><br>
<i>&gt;as intending, having a purpose, willing, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;desiring, because we can now see that the fundamental</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning of such terms is defined by a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship between a system and its environment, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship that has nothing to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;verbalizations, reasoning, or cognitions of any kind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Purpose is a far more fundamental phenomenon than any</i><br>
<i>&gt;of its various manifestations. It is, I propose, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;very basis of life."</i><br>
<p>
Well, to split hair here, we can distinguish between things<br>
a bit different.  Control systems designed by humans seem<br>
to be designed for a specific conscious purpose.  This is<br>
a bit different from the conscious purpose of individual<br>
humans, such as one's mission to the refrigerator duing<br>
commercial break.  Both of these are different from the<br>
type of behavior exhibited by the plant turning its leaves<br>
to the sun.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When Gardner says "Values are thus the means to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sustaining life: that which furthers life is a value,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and is the good; that which harms or destroys life is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a disvalue, and is bad or evil", I have to say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;this seems somewhat simplistic when the means to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sustaining my life sometimes involves destroying</i><br>
<i>&gt;other life.</i><br>
<p>
Since life only exists in individuals and only individuals<br>
can value, I see not problem.  The furthering of one life<br>
might involve the taking of another -- such as when I eat<br>
plants (I'm now vegan:).  The plants do not continue to live,<br>
you know?  Or when someone shoots someone else in<br>
self-defense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Although this is a very brief overview, I agree with</i><br>
<i>&gt;it wholeheartedly, even as I am unsure of all its</i><br>
<i>&gt;ramifications. As an example, consider the current</i><br>
<i>&gt;debate over 'intellectual property' and the Thomas</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jefferson quote: "That ideas should freely spread</i><br>
<i>&gt;from one to another over the globe, for the moral and</i><br>
<i>&gt;mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his</i><br>
<i>&gt;condition, seems to have been peculiarly and</i><br>
<i>&gt;benevolently designed by nature..."</i><br>
<p>
I think intellectual property is a tough issue for any<br>
system of rights -- whether Rand's, Locke's, Kant's<br>
or whomever's.  While we might recite the pros and<br>
cons here, I have doubts about solving the problem.:/<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;BTW, there was an excerpt from Michael Spicer,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Public Administration, Social Science, And Political</i><br>
<i>&gt;Association". _Administration &amp; Society_ (March 1998)</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the Hayek list last week (see</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9804">http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9804</a>&amp;L=hayek-l&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=10734)</i><br>
<i>&gt;that made the interesting distinction between</i><br>
<i>&gt;'purposive' and 'civil' associations:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;" ,,,  In a purposive association, it is necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt;that individual actions be conducive to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;attainment of the substantive ends of the state... On</i><br>
<i>&gt;the other hand, in a civil association, it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary that individuals undertake particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions that conform to certain substantive ends of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the state because a civil association does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;explicitly posit any such ends."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What's most interesting to me here is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;implications for human knowledge (citing same article):</i><br>
<i>&gt;"In particular, given the availability of individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;discretion over actions within a civil association,</i><br>
<i>&gt;much of the information or knowledge that men and</i><br>
<i>&gt;women use in deciding on what actions they will</i><br>
<i>&gt;undertake is inevitably dispersed and is, therefore,</i><br>
<i>&gt;inaccessible to any single mind or group of minds,</i><br>
<i>&gt;including those of social scientists."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Somehow this doesn't sound like an Objectivist</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition of knowledge to me, but that may be due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;my shallow understanding of understanding in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objectivist terms.</i><br>
<p>
It's true that Rand and other Objectivists (e.g., Larry<br>
Sechrest) have been critical of much of Hayek, I<br>
think some of the latter's ideas are compatible with<br>
[some variants of] Objectivism.  E.g., I know much<br>
more about my condition than anyone in Washington,<br>
D.C.  This doesn't mean I'm always right about me,<br>
but given the constant failures of intervention in<br>
people's lives, I think it does show, I would be and<br>
am right more often than not.  (I also have an interest<br>
in being right, moreso than anyone else, right?  No<br>
pun intended!:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not really comfortable with the notion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;romantic heroism, at least not with focusing on such</i><br>
<i>&gt;escapades, because, as LDC put it the other day: "The</i><br>
<i>&gt;myth of the small lone inventor coming up with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;unique and marvellous idea out of nothing in his</i><br>
<i>&gt;garage is fairy tale... A /true/ creative mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;honestly acknowledges that nothing is created in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;vacuum; every 'creation' is a synthesis of old ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt;from a thousand sources, and maybe one or two</i><br>
<i>&gt;randomly strewn new ones."</i><br>
<p>
I think LDC is making a caricature.  Lone inventors<br>
do come up with great ideas, and, of course, they<br>
do not exist on desert islands with no influence form<br>
other people.  This does not marr their achievement.<br>
Thomas Edison benefited greatly from living in a<br>
society that not only rewarded his inventiveness<br>
but had a culture of percolating ideas.  Surely, he<br>
stood on the shoulders of others, but he still created<br>
many great things -- some of which, I'm sure, would<br>
have taken decades or longer to invent without him.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Gardner's page on this declares: "Thus the type of</i><br>
<i>&gt;art most consistent with man's nature is romantic</i><br>
<i>&gt;realism. This school emphasizes the fact that man is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a volitional being, capable of setting values and</i><br>
<i>&gt;striving to achieve them."</i><br>
<p>
I don't know.  I do have many disagreements with<br>
this line.  See my "Interesting Parallels: Kenyon Cox<br>
and Ayn Rand on Art," "Architecture: The Missing<br>
Art Form," and "Toward and Esthetics of Horror"<br>
for an elaboration of these.  They are at:<br>
<p>
        <a href="http://www.mcs.net/~tshell/ust/homepage.htm">http://www.mcs.net/~tshell/ust/homepage.htm</a><br>
<p>
Also, I believe the Romantic Realism as exists today<br>
tend to be too formulaic.  Artistic movements typically<br>
start long before their manifestoes are published.  This<br>
does not mean all Objectivist ranting on the subject is<br>
worthless, just that it's a bit early to see if a true<br>
movement has come about.  I tend to think that art<br>
is shifting in that direction, but less because of Rand<br>
and her cohorts and more because Modern and Post-<br>
Modern Art are becoming more and more pace.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I, too, see no esthetic value in emphasizing despair</i><br>
<i>&gt;and negativity (I wonder: is "Crucifix in Urine" a</i><br>
<i>&gt;positive, negative or irrelevant artistic statement</i><br>
<i>&gt;to an atheist?); yet, striving *is* about overcoming</i><br>
<i>&gt;obstacles, and some of the most satisfying works of</i><br>
<i>&gt;'art', to me, are simply natural (and cultural)</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenes where decay and growth are juxtaposed.</i><br>
<p>
That can be pleasing.  There is a difference too between<br>
esthetics as a branch of philosophy and one's reaction<br>
to particular works of art.  The former is a reasoned study<br>
of art, its origins, its effects, etc.  The latter is a highly<br>
personal thing.  I find myself drawn to things or repulsed<br>
by them in ways I cannot always explain.  Does this means<br>
esthetics is useless?  Hardly, but one should not think of<br>
it as a means of remolding one's tastes overnight.<br>
<p>
(I do think some remolding is in order sometimes, though<br>
this is a matter for much debate.  I think art does have a<br>
major role in self-betterment and self-perfection -- much<br>
as it seems Natasha Vita More agree.  What do you<br>
think, Natasha?:) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The supposedly Balinese aphorism - "we have no art;</i><br>
<i>&gt;we do everything as beautifully as we can" - works</i><br>
<i>&gt;well for me.</i><br>
<p>
Being unfamiliar with the Balinese, their culture and the<br>
like, I've no way to judge how well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I wonder if the core of Objectivism could be</i><br>
<i>&gt;abbreviated to Reality, Reason &amp; Romanticism?</i><br>
<p>
Well, the original abbrevation is a bit too much also.  I<br>
think it might be a good starting point, but Objectivism<br>
is controversial on so many points, it's best to keep in<br>
mind that the distillation leaves a lot out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;John K</i><br>
<i>&gt;Clark doesn't like the magic number 3 (Extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt;debate with Tony Hollick a while back) but I always</i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to find myself thinking with triplex Peircean</i><br>
<i>&gt;logic :-)</i><br>
<p>
No argument from me on that preference.  No doubt,<br>
it helps to always seek something extra -- as opposed<br>
being bogged down in a system which misses some<br>
important aspects of reality.<br>
