<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;Here we go with yet another space question, which im not sure if its a <br>
<i> &gt;popular one of not but one i have always been curious about and hope </i><br>
<i> &gt;someone can shed some light upon it. It is a fact that space is </i><br>
<i> &gt;constantly expanding and at what rate im not sure. What i question is </i><br>
<i> &gt;what is space expanding "into". when a balloon expands it expands into </i><br>
<i> &gt;air, takes up "space". after we eat taco bell our stomachs "expand" and </i><br>
<i> &gt;take up "space". but when SPACE expands does it take up more SPACE? does </i><br>
<i> &gt;space make its own space to expand into, at a faster rate than it </i><br>
<i> &gt;expands? maybe its something obvious im not sure, but would sure like </i><br>
<i> &gt;some insight if anyone cares to reflect.</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Its kind of like when a capsule of air is broken open in a vacuum, it quickly<br>
expands into the vacuum.  Perhaps that is whats happening.  When I told my<br>
friend that the universe is accelerating in its expansion he suggested that<br>
perhaps the universe has reached its expansion and has been accelerating<br>
towards the center again, and thats what we're seeing.  Also, what they're<br>
using to find these results is like 8 billion years old, or thats what I<br>
heard.  So if its accelerating, it is going much faster than what we see 8<br>
billion years ago.<br>
