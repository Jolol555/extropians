  IAN: Erik, what your saying is illogical by the <br>
  very facts that you concede. Your trying to imply<br>
  that ExI is a member of a subset of cults that even <br>
  you admit does not exist. IF (a very BIG if) ExI does <br>
  fall into the set of cults (and by your standards, so <br>
  would any organization with a set of principles), it's <br>
  then a member of a subset of cults that does NOT inter-<br>
  sect with the  subset of cults of which cults such as <br>
  Scientology are a member.  However,  as your reply to <br>
  Natasha proves, you are implying that ExI is a member <br>
  of the subset of "bad cults," even as in your latter <br>
  reply to me above, you admit it's NOT such a member! <br>
<p>
  So your case is both a fallacy (it relies on subset <br>
  membership that does not exist) and is contradictory, <br>
  since you both (a) concede that the membership is null<br>
  and yet (b) directly imply that the membership exists.<br>
<p>
<p>
  It seems to me, Erik, that your simply engaging in <br>
  gratuitous cruelty against some  very  good people. <br>
  You argue that ExI falls into the definitional set <br>
  of "cult," then note that it's not your fault that <br>
  "cult" has negative connotations, as if your just <br>
  an innocent bystander in this, and yet then you do<br>
  all that you can to rub that negative connotation <br>
  in a deeply as you can (as illogical as I've just <br>
  shown it to be), obviously, simply  BECAUSE  you <br>
  know it's hurting some very decent people. Why?<br>
<p>
  I don't know why you would engage in such cruelty,<br>
  but I would say that such persecution falls into the<br>
  set of "traits of bad cults." Since you most assuredly <br>
  hold some principles, and since they probably conflict<br>
  with ExI principles, it follows that not only is your <br>
  line of attack false,  not only is it contradictory<br>
  (since the set membership implied, you admit does <br>
  not exist), but it's also a contradiction since<br>
  your attack falls in the set you erroneously <br>
  attempt to frame ExI as being a member of.<br>
