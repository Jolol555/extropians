The reason they can convert matter to energy but somehow find it<br>
easier to transport the matter is because shows about networks of<br>
self-replicating seeds don't exactly hold the fish-like attention span<br>
of your average audience.  <br>
<p>

<p>
Only on this, or possibly a palaeontology list, could 50 Million years<br>
be referred to as "an instant of time."  It is kind of strange that we<br>
don't see this kind of thing, personally I doubt the "going into VR<br>
worlds" idea is likely.  I'm quite sure we wouldn't upload without<br>
leaving a giant "We were here" sign.  Of course, the one possibility<br>
that's commonly overlooked is that they have a reason for hiding. <br>
Maybe the Intergalactic Council has a policy against interstellar<br>
eyesores.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, before any of this happens we will</i><br>

<i>&gt; Nanotechnology, uploading and artificial</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence, and it will be a radically</i><br>
<i>&gt; different world.</i><br>
<p>
There's always the possibility of sending other information through<br>
the network (for telepresence, etc.)  BTW, does anyone know how<br>
research into self-replicating robots is going?  I haven't heard<br>
anything about this for a long-time.  And while I'm here asking<br>
questions, what's the current timeframe for nanotech and/or<br>
immortality, I remember Drexler had some figures for this (didn't he<br>
say that anyone under 40 has a good chance of immortality in _Engines<br>
of Creation_ back in the early 80's?)  I'm currently feeling very<br>
sceptical about everything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't think an organization to promote</i><br>
<i>&gt; this idea could do much good, by the time it</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens any ideas we have now on the subject</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't be of any use, it would be like</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pikaia, the first animal with a spinal cord</i><br>
<i>&gt; that lived 570 million years ago worrying</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the year 2000 computer bug.</i><br>
<p>
So my International Standards Committee for Quantum Probability<br>
Engineering and Time Line Splicing (ISCQPETLS) is a bad idea?<br>
<p>
--Wax<br>

[ BTW, What does everyone think of a graphically inhanced list?  When<br>
the W3C releases it's new XML vector graphic format (VGML?) we should<br>
try and support it, vector graphics are incredibly small and versatile<br>
and being able to draw diagrams would make things very interesting. <br>
Of course, we'd have to wait for compatible tools (NS and MS will be<br>
supporting the standard). ]<br>
