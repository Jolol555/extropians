My own prejudice is about to show: <br>
<p>
I've spent a lot of time reading in parapsychology, good, bad and<br>
indifferent, and have done some experimental work of my own in<br>
precognition.  My current best guess is that some claims of psi are valid,<br>
and that the record clearly shows that veridical non-inferential<br>
foreknowledge is possible (although in a vagrant, transient and<br>
irritatingly stochastic fashion).  <br>
<p>
Most of the rational posters on this list will be horrified by this<br>
declaration, and I don't blame them.  Luckily, there are convenient sources<br>
of information about this apparently absurd and New Ageish claim.  Right<br>
now I'm reading a quite good generalist 1997 book on the topic by Dean<br>
Radin, PhD, with the unfortunate catch-penny title THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE<br>
(Harper Edge).  Even more unfortunately, the art dept has a floating - but<br>
unbent - sugar spoon on the cover, despite Radin's explicit decision *not*<br>
to discuss Geller's exploded claims in his book.  The great merit of his<br>
treatment is a lucid account of various recent meta-analyses of many<br>
hundreds of parapsychological experiments, which together provide effect<br>
sizes on the order of that demonstrated by aspirin against cardiac disease.<br>
The book's best feature, for me, is a series of charts showing the<br>
concerted data points, their error bars, and the overall non-chance<br>
meta-results and associated very tight error bars.<br>
<p>
If this line of thought is correct, we already have ample evidence that<br>
something like informational time travel exists.  I suspect it might have<br>
its best explanation in a Deutsch many-universes manifold, in which the psi<br>
percipient obtains data from a sheaf of contiguous `parallel worlds' -<br>
which somehow provides a better-than-chance estimate of how things might<br>
turn out in *this* world, without actually being a one-universe time-loop.<br>
If you see what I mean.<br>
<p>
I find this especially interesting as an onlooker at the feast of physics,<br>
because I treat psi as a crucial data point permitting us to sort out<br>
available theories according to where they allow or disallow certain<br>
non-local factors quite contrary to the way favored by most physicists (who<br>
wish to forbid temporal foreknowledge at all costs).  <br>
