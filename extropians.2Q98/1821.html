Hi...<br>
Found this article...for those who are interested..<br>

Pet Cloning, Homegrown Steak &amp; Cell Phone Spying<br>
<p>
RECYCLED ROVER<br>
<p>
Pussycats might soon live more than nine lives. Prepare<br>
yourself for the next wave of future shock -- pet cloning.<br>
<p>
A Las Vegas company called Clonaid says that by September it<br>
will start duplicating dogs and other household critters. Pet<br>
owners will never again have to suffer the loss of a beloved.<br>
<p>
<p>
"This is the next step toward human cloning, our ultimate<br>
goal," said Clonaid scientific director Dr. Brigette<br>
Boisselier. "We have been contacted by many people who want to<br>
give there pets eternal life."<br>
<p>
Clonaid is closely associated with the Raelian Movement, a<br>
group founded in the 1970s that believes life on earth was<br>
created in laboratories by space aliens known as the Elohim.<br>
Their founder, Rael, says, "Cloning will enable mankind to<br>
reach eternal life."<br>
<p>
"We foresee no legal hurdles and less ethical resistance than<br>
with human cloning," Boisselier says.<br>
<p>
The cloning procedure for a horse will probably cost at least<br>
$100,000, she says. Other animals may be cheaper based on<br>
their size and gestation period.<br>
<p>
Not sure when you want to send in the clones? Try Clonaids<br>
Insuraclone. With this service, Fidos cells are stored in<br>
something akin to a blood bank. If he ever chews on the wrong<br>
bone, you then decide whether you want to defrost a<br>
replacement. <br>
<p>
Cloning Tip: If your pet dies, dont pack it in ice and ship it<br>
to Clonaid. For best results, deep freeze the pooch in liquid<br>
nitroge<br>
