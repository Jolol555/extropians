<i>&gt;&gt; 	Alex = !Ian</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ...does Ian believe that it somehow follows that we are in fact the same</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; that is also not Ian add up to an Ian equivalent? </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 	Given that the universe can be defined in terms of its</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sure Ian will send back a rather lengthy reply, but the long and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;short of it is this:  If I ask who Alex is, and I get back the answer</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Alex is Alex," I will not really have learned anything.  If I get the</i><br>
<i>&gt;response "Alex is like Ian, only with the following differences:" then I</i><br>
<i>&gt;get a far more complete answer.  What we conclude is that we have to know</i><br>
<i>&gt;something about what you are not in order to have any idea as to what you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are.  If you and Ian were the only two entities in the universe, then on</i><br>
<i>&gt;some level you would have an identity only by virtue of the fact that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;differed from Ian. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is clearest when used in terms of color.  If everything in the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;universe were red, then you couldn't really define red in any meaningful</i><br>
<i>&gt;way.  However, you could do so if there were OTHER colors, in which case</i><br>
<i>&gt;you might get an idea of what red is by examining the ways in which it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;different from the other colors. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Very well elucidated! 100%!<br>
   I couldn't have said it better.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;nb, Ian is also somewhat liberal with his use of the logical operators. </i><br>
<i>&gt;When he says "=", he probably doesn't mean the "=" to which you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;accustomed.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: That I disagree with. The use of "="<br>
   means that what appears on the left is the <br>
   "same as" what appears on the right. So "A = A"<br>
   is the same as (=) saying "A is the same as A."<br>
<p>
         (A = A) = (A is the same as A)<br>
<p>
   "Not same as" is the same as "does not equal,"<br>
   or ascii-wise =/=, which means "different than."<br>
<p>
   The "A = A" identity axiom really only serves<br>
   to inform use by example of what the "=" means<br>
   by telling us in the most obvious fashion, "What<br>
   appears on the left side is the same as what appears<br>
   on the right side of this symbol, wherever this symbol <br>
   is used." It's a symbolic instruction, not a blueprint<br>
   of the structure of identity, which would include -A. <br>
<p>
   As to my use of the "=" symbol, I have defined its <br>
   logical application pertaining to the answer to the <br>
   inquiry, "What is the degree to which the indentity <br>
   of A requires A and what is the degree to which it <br>
   requires -A," and the answer is that the degree to <br>
   which A requires A is equal to -- i.e., is the <br>
   same as (=) -- the degree to which A requires -A.<br>
