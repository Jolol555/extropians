A simple logical question: WHERE would enough water come from, to totally<br>
cover the Earth above the tops of all mountains? To cover K2/Everest would<br>
require about 29,000 feet of water above sealevel.<br>
<p>
If you vaporized all the ice on Earth, the resulting rainfall would only<br>
raise the sealevel by maybe 25 feet.<br>
<p>
The only way this makes sense globally is for God to import a few million<br>
ice asteroids, and vacuum up the mess after the forty days..<br>
