<i>&gt; &gt; If "everybody wants the power" in the sense</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that they are competing against each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for it, they will form gangs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've never heard of a gang without a leader.  I'm not sure it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible, even consensus among the gang members would mean giving up a</i><br>
<i>&gt; degree of power.  If an organisation could be formed within this</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation it is likely to be short-lived and highly unstable.</i><br>
<p>
Gangs tend to be unstable in the sense that the leadership shifts, <br>
and relative power between gangs changes.<br>
<p>
However, a member of a gang, even if not a leader, shares in power <br>
and privilege as compared to people who are not gang members, to the <br>
extent that the gang is able to do as it wills without interference <br>
from some more-powerful authority.<br>
<p>
Without gangs, the ninth- and tenth-strongest people in a small area <br>
are unlikely to have very much power.  If they band together in a <br>
gang, they will jointly probably be stronger than the fifth-strongest <br>
person.  If they can get that fifth-strongest person to join their <br>
gang, they will probably be stronger than the strongest person.  So <br>
even though the ninth- and tenth-strongest persons have to share the <br>
power the gang wins, they have far more power than they would have <br>
without the gang.  Naturally, the strongest person doesn't like this, <br>
so he's forming a gang too.  Then you get a situation where personal <br>
strength may be important, but ability to make good decisions for the <br>
gang and to inspire confidence, enthusiasm, and loyalty is *more* <br>
important.  If the tenth-strongest person can get half of all the <br>
weaker wanna-be-leaders to back him, and the nine stronger people <br>
divide the other half evenly among themselves, then the <br>
tenth-strongest person has the power to choose the king -- or be king <br>
himself.<br>
<p>
A gang, to the extent that it tries to control the actions of <br>
non-members (or extract wealth from them, or make them join) without <br>
their consent, is a government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; A stable anarchy would indeed make each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; person a government -- over a very small</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; area that doesn't overlap with anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; else's very small area except by mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consent.  That doesn't create the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; situation of multiple governments over</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the same area.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The original idea of anarchy is to give all individuals the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; pursue their own freedom.  A freedom dictated only by other like</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals (the reason why "traditional" anarchists are against large</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporations and establishments.)  Once you start using restriction</i><br>
<i>&gt; and consensus to achieve this goal you loose the original intent.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth is, although we can talk about how anarchy might occur (and try</i><br>
<i>&gt; to encourage those elements involved), forcing it to do so is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; complete contradiction to its very nature.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But we are in agreement on one fact - all individuals must fill the</i><br>
<i>&gt; power vacuum.  The only way this can occur is through more powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ubiquitous technologies of 'control.'  The definition of 'control'</i><br>
<i>&gt; has becoming ubiquitous communication (broadcast.)  The original</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideology of the Internet was to give all users the power to create,</i><br>
<i>&gt; distribute, and use information in an attempt to decentralise the</i><br>
<i>&gt; power of the media.  Without a doubt continuing this trend would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantageous to all individuals (especially me.)  And don't be fooled</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the consumer-capitalist front-end that's been tacked on to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Internet recently, it's just there to fund it's own demise.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And with them go technology and any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cooperation on a large scale.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Without private property *all* you get is large-scale co-operation.</i><br>
<p>
Without private property, why do people cooperate?<br>
<p>
The purpose of work is gain the resources to survive and do what you <br>
*really* want to do.  For most people, each of those takes some <br>
amount of property they have personal sole control over -- private <br>
property, or property shared among a *small* group according to a <br>
known schedule.  A writer cannot function without writing equipment <br>
and supplies (paper, pens, pencils, computer, typewriter, whatever) <br>
that is reliably available to him.  A dancer cannot function without <br>
a practice space, preferably one built to a dancer's specifications <br>
(dancers tend to be very very fussy about floors), reliably <br>
available, probably for several hours a day.  A dedicated couch <br>
potato needs a couch.  An  inventor needs space and tools to tinker <br>
with her inventions, with confidence that inventions-in-progress <br>
too big to move easily (along with the tools and raw materials) can <br>
be left there and will be unchanged when she returns.<br>
<p>
But the inventor's tools and space, the dancer's floor, the writer's <br>
pencils, are all "means of production" and under even the less <br>
complete versions of socialist "elimination of private property" <br>
would be shared equally among all people.  The dancer has no right to <br>
say that for this period each day the dance studio he built is *not* <br>
available as a place for small children to play.  The inventor has no <br>
right to bar others from taking apart his half-finished invention.  <br>
The writer has no basis for protest when a bored neighbor makes paper <br>
airplanes of his manuscript and flies them into the lake.  The couch <br>
potato cannot expel the neighbor's cat from his couch.<br>
<p>
Without the ability to control property, the writer cannot write; the <br>
dancer cannot dance; the inventor cannot invent; the couch potato <br>
cannot loaf.<br>
<p>
Whither then anarchy?  Whither then freedom?  Whither then <br>
productivity?<br>
