IMO, consistent time like loops are possible, but very, VERY VERY<br>
rare, less likely than all the molecules in this room moving into<br>
the next one. I personally doubt the notion of time beyond providing<br>
a framework for micro events. I suspect that the "arrow of time" is<br>
intimately connected to the process of creating and preserving<br>
memory.<br>
<p>
I've posted on this about a year ago, here's a summary. Imagine<br>
the Universe as the set of all possible states for its contents.<br>
Display this ensemble of states as a swarm of dots. (LOTSA DOTS!<br>
I don't know how to calculate the magnitude of this number, but<br>
I do recall Penrose stating numbers like ((10^100)^100). Represent<br>
the rules of physics as links between the nodes. (Yup! The mother<br>
of all Feynmann diagrams!)(Well not really, since STATES, not<br>
particles are represented here)<br>
<p>
Then, at each point there are a gazillion links to other points, but<br>
each point's connections represent much less than a bazillion'th part<br>
of the set of all points.<br>
<p>
In this web, though most transitions are consistent with entropic<br>
time, there are a FEW paths which create loops. By definition these<br>
loops are consistent. But, oh, so rare!<br>
<p>
Oh yeah - some of these transitions will look just like a functioning<br>
worm hole...<br>

<i>&gt;There is a classic sci-fi story in which (to simplify slightly) the</i><br>
<i>&gt;man who will be known as the inventor of the time machine didn't invent</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, he was given it by a future version of himself.  This would seemingly</i><br>
<i>&gt;be consistent and has no contradictions, but it is paradoxical that</i><br>
<i>&gt;a complex device like this would have no inventor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You also have to ask how the non-contradiction principle would prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt;the actions of people who want to produce events in the past which are</i><br>
<i>&gt;inconsistent with history.  Seemingly the universe must interpose some</i><br>
<i>&gt;obstacles which will inevitably thwart their efforts.  The universe</i><br>
<i>&gt;is forced in effect to act as a smart opponent, always coming up with</i><br>
<i>&gt;something which defeats the clever tricks people try to use.</i><br>
