<i>&gt; From: Erik Moeller &lt;flagg@oberberg-online.de&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Pick a fight, yeah. Maybe with people who don't even want to fight. And still battle them, until their beliefs are shaken in their fundamentals.Maybe drive them into suicide.&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<p>
The meek might be spared the harsh reality of their affliction, but the<br>
militant ones should be given hell, so to speak. You know, an eye for an<br>
eye... <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I work with fundamental Christians. Although I have all the knowledge to refute their beliefs completely, I don't. Why should I interfere with other people's lives?&lt;&lt; </i><br>
<p>
To save them, mentally and physically?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; But a militant atheist could destroy these lives, even with</i><br>
words only. That's specific for religion, because it is irrational, it<br>
is always attackable. But the emotions connected with the religous<br>
beliefs are not. And that's why you cannot predict how someone whose<br>
worldview has just been destroyed will react.&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
You underestimate the power of the religion meme. It's almost impossible<br>
to remove it; it gets stronger when attacked (the poor martyr sub-meme).<br>
No amount of reason will suffice, god knows I've tried ;-) Should the<br>
unthinkable happen (it's a miracle!) and you<br>
*do* succeed in turning someone away from religion, than you have<br>
an excellent replacement meme readily at hand: transhumanism. It<br>
offers the same advantages as religion (belief in immortality, "heaven",<br>
ascension etc.) minus the nasty/useless stuff. "Do not serve God, but<br>
become him"<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I wouldn't call that mindfucking. I would call it mind rape. And it's a type of coercion, too.&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<p>
I would call it leaving a serious mental condition untreated.<br>
