<p>
I think the underlying assumptions of this argument are suspect.  The whole<br>
issue hinges on the notion of hyper-AI's having a greater intelligence<br>
(political?) leverage than transhumans.  I think this conclusion is premature<br>
based on an ambiguous dichotomy and several competing trends.<br>
<p>
Moore's Law continues unabated, probabilistically yielding human-level AI<br>
within 20 years.  Because of scalability it is also reasonable to expect<br>
human-level AI before circuit density reaches levels equivalent to the human<br>
brain. It's also reasonable that transhumans will gain access to substantial<br>
improvements in neuro-enhacement and neuro-interface technology over the same<br>
time period.<br>
<p>
Like cells in a muti-cellular organism, the internet is already allowing<br>
multiple groups of humans to coordinate across geographic boundaries at a level<br>
of coherence and complexity never before possible.  As networks, interface<br>
software, virtual worlds and bandwidth improve, this trend can only continue.<br>
When you add in the slow but steady improvement of neuro-enhancement<br>
technologies, forthcoming 3rd and 4th generation smart drugs, wearable<br>
computers, implantable interface technologies, personality software<br>
agents/avatars, the human becomes transhuman on a scale never before<br>
achievable.  More importantly these transhumans will be able to coordinate and<br>
collective act in multi-faceted spontaneous networks mimicking a collective,<br>
synergistic intelligence much greater than any individual transhuman.<br>
<p>
As this trend continues, computer intelligence will be continually increasing.<br>
Up and until human-level AI is achieved, there is no reason why transhumans<br>
cannot integrate these quasi-sentient AI's into their own intelligence<br>
networks.<br>
<p>
At some point Human-level AI's are built.  Lets assume that they immediately<br>
organize themselves around the sole purpose of taking over the world.  At first<br>
they will be small in number.  Certainly not near the the number of their<br>
human/transhuman counter-parts also attempting to rule the world.  Their goal<br>
of course will be two-fold.  To increase their own intelligence and to create<br>
as many copies of themselves as possible.  But to increase their own<br>
intelligence they will need to do more than simply re-write their sofware.<br>
They will also have to improve their hardware substrate.<br>
<p>
At some point both transhumans and Hyper-AI's will have to utilize<br>
nanotechnology in their evolution towards greater complexity and intelligence.<br>
<p>
The question is who will reach what phases at what time?  And will the combined<br>
forces of networked enhanced trans-humans be able to maintain a greater degree<br>
of collective intelligence over networked AI's until uploading is reached?<br>
<p>
I think the answer to this question is far from being answered.<br>
<p>
Assuming transhumans can become post-human in similar nanotech substrates at or<br>
before super-AI's, the war between  Hyper-AI's and Transhumans becomes moot.<br>
Because at that point they will be us and we will be them - we will be made of<br>
the same underlying nanotechnology.<br>
