          <br>
<p>
There is another huge difference, non-local quantum effects do not transmit <br>
information but ESP, if it exists as the experimentalists claim, does. That <br>
would render most of modern Physics to the trash can.<br>
              <br>

          <br>
<p>
If true then science would need to be revolutionized more radically then it <br>
has ever been before, but I'm EXTREMELY skeptical that they have the skill to <br>
detect very subtle statistical effects when most who work in this area can  <br>
not detect blatant fraud even when it's screaming in their face. <br>
<p>
I'm not familiar with The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research and their <br>
20 year history you speak of, but the general history of this area does not <br>
engender much confidence. "Scientists" routinely  wrote learned articles <br>
about miraculous occurrences that later turn out to have been performed by <br>
the same simple tricks amateur magicians use to entertain children at <br>
birthday parties. The most famous of them was J B Rhine and he doesn't seem <br>
to have been very bright.<br>
<p>
I certainly don't think more experiments are needed in precognition because  <br>
every week a huge experiment on it is conducted under the most rigorous <br>
controls imaginable. Every week in the USA millions of people buy lottery <br>
tickets and have been doing so for many years. On every Saturday 6 numbers <br>
are picked at random, each number can be 1 to 50, if you guess all 6 numbers <br>
you win millions of dollars, if you guess 3 you win about $10. If there were <br>
anything to ESP the number of winners should be larger that what you would <br>
expect from chance, but it is not, and if the effect is too small for even a <br>
huge experiment like the lottery to detect then The Princeton Engineering <br>
Anomalies Research sure as hell won't find it.<br>
