<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin &lt;warrl@mail.blarg.net&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; A perfect social or political system, in all systems I have examined, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; requires perfect people in some quantity -- dictatorship being the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; best in this regard because it requires the fewest perfect people, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and anarchy among the worst because it requires that the overwhelming </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; majority -- possibly everyone -- be perfect.  In this part of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; world, perfect people are a rather scarce item, and what I read in </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the newspapers doesn't tell me that this is a strictly local </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; shortage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Imperfect anarchy is unstable, and seems likely to quickly collapse </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; into tribal warlordism, and then later into dictatorship or </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; hereditary monarchy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes, exactly! I couldn't agree more. From a purely rational point of view</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a "dictatorship" or oligargy based on enlightened principles (as discussed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; earlier) would be the most preferable form of government. There is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reasonable possibility to pick the right people to rule a country (there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have been benevolent emperors in the past, I belief for ex. the Romans had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a few),</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first four or five Roman emperors were childless.  They each took </i><br>
<i>&gt; the same approach to choosing a successor, which was:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  (1) appoint apparently-good people to be provincial governors</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (2) any who proved incompetent, fire and give somebody else a chance</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (3) after a while, bring home the best provincial governor and adopt </i><br>
<i>&gt; him.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first Emperor was apparently a good one, along with all who were </i><br>
<i>&gt; chosen by this method.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Eventually they got an Emperor who had kids.  His eldest son was his </i><br>
<i>&gt; successor and was more than a bit of a jerk.  This set the tradition: </i><br>
<i>&gt; almost every Emperor who inherited the throne from his biological </i><br>
<i>&gt; father was worse than his predecessor; almost every Emperor who did </i><br>
<i>&gt; *not* was *better* than his predecessor; almost every chosen-Emperor </i><br>
<i>&gt; who chosen by a chosen-Emperor was pretty decent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The catch is that the dictator, by definition, has the right to </i><br>
<i>&gt; either change the rules of succession,  or choose </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone he likes; and, if he's at all a decent father, will want to </i><br>
<i>&gt; provide well for his kids.  This means... </i><br>
<p>
...that we need immortal emperors without a childwish(*)? Or a system<br>
where the emperor may change all laws except certain fundamental<br>
ones (a sort of constitutional monarchy?) including the the law that<br>
forbids emperors from having children. Who checks? A supreme court<br>
maybe, or some other institution of special guardians with security<br>
forces to back them up. Preferably three or more of such institutions to<br>
provide a balance. Or the emperor would have to have his nads removed<br>
before being allowed into office :-)<br>
<p>
Oh yes, now I happen to think of it: any system would only have to last<br>
about a hundred years or so, 'cause by then things will be changed <br>
beyond recognition anyway, for better or for worse. So I guess the emperor<br>
system could work quite well since you'll need only 3 or so, maybe even<br>
less with life extension and all.<br>

into office :-)<br>
