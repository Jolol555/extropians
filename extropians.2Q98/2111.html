-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>
<p>
	Most people here probably don't use or know much about Pretty Good<br>
Privacy (PGP), but they really should, if they are serious about privacy<br>
and digital security. PGP is a method for people to encrypt data intended<br>
for your eyes only. Equally useful is PGP's ability to generate digital<br>
signatures so people know that a message really was written by you. The<br>
first step is to download the freeware version of PGP 5.55 from...<br>
www.pgp.com (both Mac and PC versions available). Then, mess around with<br>
it, see how it works, even read the manual perhaps. Finally, if you still<br>
can't get it to work properly, send me email personally with "PGP" as the<br>
subject and time permitting, I will try to talk you through it over email<br>
or some other medium.<br>
	Please note that certain misguided countries, including the USA,<br>
have export restrictions on PGP.<br>
<p>
