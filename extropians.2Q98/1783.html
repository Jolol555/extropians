This is interesting stuff.  Where can I read more about this?<br>

In answer to your question as to why anyone would invent if they did not<br>
get paid for it, I repeat my argument that inventors WOULD get paid: <br>
once, at the time of invention.  It would be worth paying them because the<br>
invention would create a new market (or more demand, in the case of an<br>
incremental change to an existing product).  The fact that others would<br>
compete in this market does NOT make the invention valueless to the<br>
supplier; it just means that the firm will only reap its percentage of the<br>
market share, rather than the whole of the market (minus deadweight loss<br>
from monopoization). <br>
