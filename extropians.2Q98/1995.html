<i>&gt; contract to do anything for you; are you going to try to enforce terms on</i><br>
<i>&gt; a contract I didn't sign?</i><br>
<p>
Being in receipt of stolen goods is a crime no matter what your relationship or level of knowledge about its<br>
source or the merchant you purchase it from. This is why art collectors who are now in posession of artwork<br>
stolen from Jews by Nazi's and sold through middlemen can have their 'posessions' simply seized, as it was not<br>
theirs, nor was it owned by the person who sold it to them.<br>
<p>
In any event you DID sign a contract when you bought the illegal information from an anonymous seller: you waived<br>
the seller, recognised that the seller made absolutely no guarrantees as it its accuracy, validity, or origin.<br>
I.E. you bought into the implied caveat emptor contract that goes with any commercial trade as a base of<br>
understanding.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In addition, you get even worse problems when the merchant is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; anonymous.  Suppose I post through anonymous remailers and a mail2news</i><br>
<i>&gt; gateway that I have a copy of your manuscript available for anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; sends me the price of a copy in anonymous cash.  I don't know to whom I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; selling, and they don't know from whom they are buying.  How are you going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to prosecute me THEN?</i><br>
<p>
a) Your customers, if caught with the illegal copies in their posession, will be arrested and prosecuted. Their<br>
arrest and prosecution will be publicized in the media, thus generating a deterrent effect in the public that<br>
will impinge upon your ability to do business.<br>
<p>
b) nothing is totally anonymous. Anything on the net can be traced. As for your arguments about the cost of<br>
enforcement, I can also say that the internet also gives IP enforcement agencies the ability to greatly reduce<br>
the cost of IP enforcement, at least in regards to web commerce. I think that these costs will be reduced enough<br>
that it will totally offset, and then some, your imagined 'efficiency' of having no IP.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; IP law is merely a societal contract under which the government is delegated authority to enforce the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individual contract rights of all of its citizens. It does not matter if the government is a monopoly state</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or a competetive PPL. The principle is the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree.  Normally I cannot enforce the terms on a contract upon</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone with whom I have not contracted; only through special IP laws is</i><br>
<i>&gt; this possible.</i><br>
<p>
If the person with whom you have contracted violates their contract with someone else with whom they contract,<br>
and that third party passes along the information to a fourth party via another contract, the responsibility is<br>
carried over.<br>
<p>
You cannot enforce the terms of your contract with someone who has never come in contract with a party within<br>
your contract chain. ANyone else can be bound.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I read that, which was what got me started on this whole thread. You still treat patents as monopolies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; while I treat them as competetive advantages in a competetive market. If you stop treating patents as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; monopolies, then your argument goes away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think on some level one must cede this definition, at least on the point</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a copyright holder has a monopoly over copies of that particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; piece of information.</i><br>
<p>
But you are talking about a market. Markets are not markets of brand names, but of product types. The cola market<br>
is not the Coca-Cola market, or the Pepsi market, but the cola market. Both have different recipes for cola,<br>
which are protected by patent, both compete to satisfy the public demand for colas with different products. You<br>
cannot say that Coca-Cola has a monopoly on the cola market. Thus my assertion that a patent is not a monopoly<br>
stands.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; With electronic duplication and transmission, the costs are almost nil.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but it's that "almost" that would keep the market going, at much</i><br>
<i>&gt; larger quantities than before, at a far far lower price.  Water is almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; free, yet it sells regardless.  Since copies without IP laws are widgets,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the analogy is apt.</i><br>
<p>
So you are for treating IP as a commodity. Any commodity market is going to trend toward an oligopoly situation,<br>
as economies of scale push smaller producers out or up in the market. Why is this? Because in the case of<br>
internet commerce, bandwidth is discounted for large users, and hardware like servers, routers, drive systems, CD<br>
writers, etc. are all cheaper on a per kilobyte basis the larger capacity you go.<br>
<p>
In this scenario, the small home grown inventor is discouraged from becomeing a player in the market, unless they<br>
are a rich bachelor who expects to get ripped off by the big boys, playing it off as if they are great<br>
philanthropists, humantarians, etc..., or ulness the home grown inventor sells out to the established players in<br>
the market. You are not encouraging a free market, but encouraging oligopoly/mercantilism.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; But I can go buy the Red Hat CD and reproduce it if I want. I have a CDR deck on my PC here, and I can get</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; CD blanks for less than $2.00. Where is Red Hat gonna be when I can sell copies of their CD for 10% of what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they sell it for, or even 20%? I could offer it on my web site for free transmission.  Obviously Red Hat</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has put some added value into their Linux offering, so how do they expect to recoup their investment if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; everyone can freely reproduce their product?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Beats me, but they do it anyway, and people DO put it up on their</i><br>
<i>&gt; web sites.  Trouble is, it's rather large; so large that it's often more</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient to earn $50 and buy a CD than it is to spend your time</i><br>
<i>&gt; downloading Linux.  But nonetheless, it's available online, and yet the</i><br>
<i>&gt; CDs still sell.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Weird, isn't it?</i><br>
<p>
Yes it is weird, but your numbers for the present market are not worth extrapolating from as it still is less<br>
than 0.1 % of the market, yet even if LINUX catches on in the market beyond the hobbyist or iconoclast, companies<br>
like Red Hat will not make any decent level of revinue, until one of the established companies, like Microsoft,<br>
comes along and modifies the OS into something which it can protect, LinOS II. They then will promote this, and<br>
soak up the entire market, putting Red Hat out of business, or back in the hat closet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Even if it slowly advances, since there is no longer sufficient incentive for most people to invent, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they have to worry about feeding their families first, invention will again become merely the province of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rich bachelors who can't get laid.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whenever the free market rations anything, it rations it to the rich and</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the exceptionally devoted.  Fortunately for us, the exceptionally</i><br>
<i>&gt; devoted are also in many ways the most productive.  So it's a trade off.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At any rate, if we gain economic efficiency as a result of this trade off,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's a good thing.</i><br>
<p>
It would be a good thing. However I think that your expectation is wrong, and even if it does gain efficiency, it<br>
will be because the commodity market for IP pushes invention supply into an oligopoly situation, which any self<br>
proclaimed libertarian free marketer should abhor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Its actually rather simple, though tedious. Its merely a measure of growth of sales of products bearing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chinese patent numbers. Just as today's economic growth here in the US is almost entirely in the high tech</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sector. Kill IP in the US and you will have economic stagnation here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you misunderstood my point.  Clearly, some of the decrease in</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention came from the lack of IP, but I think you'd be hard pressed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; argue that the planned economy had nothing to do with it.  I was asking</i><br>
<i>&gt; how one would go about discovering what part of the lost patents were due</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a planned economy and what part was due to a lack of IP.</i><br>
<p>
Considering that the economy is still pretty planned, with most industry still in the hands of Communist party<br>
apparatchiks, I think that a) most of its economic growth is from externalization of western IP costs via<br>
pirating of foreign owned IP properties, and the rest is b) from internal IP that is owned by state industries<br>
and enforced by party apparatchiks with connections with police or army authorities, or c) small consumer<br>
businesses, mostly in the service industries, that are privately owned.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes, this is rather indicative, isn't it??? A lack of ability to forecast productivity increases due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technological innovation seems to be a rather huge gaping hole in a model which claims to be so accurate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doesnt' it? Of course, they only give average accuracy numbers. I'd like to see how the accuracy numbers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have changed over time. Even Greenspan has noted how current economic models have totally failed to predict</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the present economy, which is almost entirely due to increased industrial productivity derived from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; high rate of technological advancement. I'll bet that the accuracy of the model is far less now than it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 20 years ago. I note that it is also restricted to a forecasting ability of only 4 years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Economic forecasting is not entirely unlike weather forecasting to that</i><br>
<i>&gt; extent.  However, fortunately for my argument, these are all macroecnomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; forecasts, not microeconomic forecasts.  My argument from microeconomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiency is not affected by the failures of macroeconomic models.</i><br>
<p>
yet you claim with a wave of your hand that nicroeconomic efficiency is beneficial for the macro economy without<br>
showing HOW it benefits the macro economy, WHO in the macroeconomy truly benefits, and refuse to measure the<br>
effect in the macro economy of the disincentive to invent on the rate of invention, and reduction in productivity<br>
that results from stagnated technological development.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; How do you expect to demonstrate their relative sizes without knowing how large either shape is??? If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can do that its you that should get the nobel.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The men who have done so have ALREADY won Nobel prizes; I stand upon the</i><br>
<i>&gt; shoulders of giants when I follow their work.</i><br>
<p>
All bow down in praise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As to how I can determine</i><br>
<i>&gt; relative sizes without knowing the size of either shape, we use</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculus and the supply and demand graph to tell us a lot about economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiency; for example, since monopolists represent the entire market,</i><br>
<i>&gt; their marginal revenue curve decreases twice as fast as the demand curve.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since firms will produce up until the point where marginal revenue equals</i><br>
<i>&gt; marginal cost, the quantity produced by a monopolist will be less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; that produced in competition.</i><br>
<p>
I would love to see links or book refs to anything that shows that you can determine the relative size of two<br>
shapes without knowing the quantitative size of either shape. Sounds like magic to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unclear?  I've made graphs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/monop.html">http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/monop.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've just demonstrated that the monopolist's quantity will be less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; that produced in competition, despite the fact that I don't know how many</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be produced in competition or how many the monopolist would produce,</i><br>
<i>&gt; verifying my earlier claim that I could find relative sizes without</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowing absolute sizes.</i><br>
<p>
Yet you show no quantified relative size. Also, since you only count marginal costs, not fixed costs, your chart<br>
is absolutely meaningless, especially in an IP marketplace, where almost all costs are fixed costs (i.e. R&amp;D),<br>
while the marginal costs of reproduction are nil. Additionally, your measure of efficiency, i.e. the quantity<br>
made available in the marketplace, is wrong. The efficiency differential  is measured as the change in price<br>
times the change in quantity.<br>
<p>
In addition, you also only use straight lines in your graph, which any microeconomist can easily tell you are<br>
simplistic and inaccurate of a real market. The demand, cost and monopolist market line all will tend to be<br>
S-curves of one degree or another, depending on the product, the state of the art at that time, consumer<br>
confidence and utility, etc. In a market with such S-curves, the efficiency gained can be reduced or amplified<br>
over your straight lined graph, depending on how the lines intersect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; SUch schemes are not currently used as the cost is currently greater than the cost of IP enforcement at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this time, due to the sufficiently widespread respect for IP protection. If this were to change, then such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; schemes would then become cost effective. One such scheme takes advantage of passive boot sector virus/worm</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology to monitor tampering. If write attempts are made to specific hidden read only files, the virus</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or worm built into the software will corrupt enough data to foil the tampering attempt, making the software</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unusable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A priori, I cannot show that it would be cost effective to protect</i><br>
<i>&gt; software in a secure way; I can do so using market numbers, however.</i><br>
<i>&gt; According to the Software Publishers Association, "Few other industries</i><br>
<i>&gt; lose as much revenue to theft, estimated at $13.2 billion; nearly 1 out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2 copies of software is illegally installed."* In light of this, I find it</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard to believe that eliminating piracy would be unprofitable, even if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is thanks to piracy in other countries.</i><br>
<p>
Because it is thanks to piracy in other countries, it is unprofitable. Since a piracy enforcement agency, whether<br>
a government or a PPL, cannot operate in a monopoly state jurisdiction without the expressed approval of that<br>
state monopoly, and must operate within the legal guidlines set by that jurisdiciton, any state that wishes to<br>
shelter piracy can make it unprofitable to enforce IP rights. Just as most terrorism and guerrilla warfare is not<br>
successfull without the shelter and support from states outside the zone of conflict, IP piracy is only sucessful<br>
with the direct participation, shelter and support of state monopolies.of power. Dont' make me label you a<br>
pro-statist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the contrary, the reason software companies don't use this particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; scheme is that it wouldn't work:  Just set up a copier that emulates a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer, that records the program rather than executes it, and you've got</i><br>
<i>&gt; a fully functioning warez machine.  Nintendo game copiers operate on</i><br>
<i>&gt; precisely this principle; if you weren't aware, there is a thriving warez</i><br>
<i>&gt; market for pirated Nintendo and Super Nintendo games, both of which come</i><br>
<i>&gt; on ROM chips soldered into the game cartridges.  A "tamper-proof"</i><br>
<i>&gt; cartridge would do you no good: All I have to do is read the game off of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cart, and I'm golden.</i><br>
<p>
And it is just as easy to have programs written on a CD which automatically run when the CD is accessed. This is<br>
how viruses get away with their mischeif. While AV software may be able to wipe a virus on a floppy, a) on a CD<br>
there is plenty of room for multiple copies to watch over each other, and b) a CD cannot be overwritten that<br>
easily.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; However, you can predict the change in incentive to invent, and determine the utility value of invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for inventors. This gives you the invention supply curve.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Beg your pardon?  By precisely how much will the incentive to invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; change?</i><br>
<p>
It can be measured by the percentage of patents issued which are brought to market with the help of measureable<br>
capital investment. Since capital invested in such a risk investment will demand a given return on that<br>
investment, if the total on investment is reduced by the lack of IP protection to the point that the given rate<br>
of return on investment demanded by the capital market will dictate that the amount of money an inventor can<br>
raise from investors for a given invention will decrease below the point required to bring the given invention to<br>
market, then the inventor will not bring that particular invention to market. I don't have any data right now, so<br>
I am not making any blind guesses (unlike you).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My argument has been qualitative, arguing that the incentive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; invent would decrease, but not specifying absolutely by how much.</i><br>
<p>
Which is simply a cop out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Then correlating rates of patents being issued</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with productivity growth in an economy, all other factors being equal, you can predict how change in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; supply of inventions will change the productivity growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The whole point of my argument is that all other factors would NOT be</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal: the market for copies would greatly expand if copyright were</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminated, and not having to pay for enforcement would lead to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-trival income effect.  You can't just leave these out of your</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculations.</i><br>
<p>
And I say that since the supply of inventions will contract markedly, your pricing will not change much, until<br>
consumer demand outstrips supply, due to population growth and limited resources, and no change in resource<br>
utilization efficiencies do to stagnated tefhnological growth. At which point you will have inflation and<br>
economic stagnation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; While I assert that current IP is merely a matter of monopoly government acting as a PPL in protecting the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IP licenses of its contracted (i.e. patents granted) citizens. If I were in a libertarian society, I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a free choice of PPL agencies to contract the protection of my IP with, and would only engage in IP</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trade with indviduals that were customers of the same PPL or with competetive  PPL's with which my PPL had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IP agreements with.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A PPA which tries to enforce contracts on those who have not agreed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their terms will probably not be economically efficient; similarly, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be impossbile to catch your intended victims over the Internet when</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are selling anonymously.</i><br>
<p>
Yet any web server/router/backbone owner will have a contract with an insurance company to protect their assets,<br>
especially if they have capital leins on the equipment. In a libertarian world, any sane insurance company will<br>
require that the network asset owner subject himself/herself to the authority of their contracted PPL. Most or<br>
all PPLs will have interlocking contracts of enforcement. Thus you will be able to track anyone on the net that<br>
vilates your IP contract, and you are covered by your IP protection clause in your insurance policy. Anyone you<br>
license your property to will have to subject themselves in your license agreement to ajudication and enforcement<br>
of your self licensed IP rights, ergo your PPL can do a network audit on your customers networks, on their ISP<br>
routers, etc. In an internet world, the cost of IP enforcement will go down remarkably.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I find it difficult to follow your charts due to the problems with lining up the characters. If you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; produce either graphics or excel compatible charts I would appreciate it. Feel free to send these via</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; personal email at retroman@together.net. In any event, I see something which you may not. If a competetive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; business only has to lower its price half as much to increase its market share as a monopoly does to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; increase the entire market, then obviously it is more efficient to have a monopoly provide a product. If it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wants to increase its market size it must lower its price twice as much than if it were a competetive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; business. That tells me that the comsumers benefit twice as much from a monopoly than from a competetive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; business. I for one don't beleive that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you still have misgivings after looking at the analysis on my web site?</i><br>
<p>
No I just saw that. See my remarks above....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If the inventor has to recoup his research, development, and production refinement costs and his</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; competetors do not, then he is at a competetive disadvantage to invent. Better to let some other schmuck</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; take those costs and steal his inventions from him. In such a situation, the incentive to invent will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; negative, and invention will stagnate.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again wrong.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when MARGINAL</i><br>
<i>&gt; costs are higher, not when sunk costs are higher.  For an analysis of</i><br>
<i>&gt; this, look at: <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html">http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The cost of invention is sunk, which means that it doesn't change the</i><br>
<i>&gt; shape of the supply curve.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when</i><br>
<i>&gt; your supply curve is higher than the other guy's supply curve, so this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; clearly not the case.  Instead, we see from the graphs that invention is</i><br>
<i>&gt; only profitable if the increased revenues from invention outweigh the sunk</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost of invention; this incentive is smaller than that under a monopoly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but not zero.</i><br>
<p>
I think that this is a totally bogus claim. You are completely off your rocker here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If it were so, then why are all of the economists totally flabbergasted at today's economy? None of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; models have predicted the huge increases in productivity which are what is driving our economic growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; MACRO, not micro.  Give me an example of where MICRO has failed us.</i><br>
<p>
Simplistic, basic microeconomic charts, any skilled economist will tell you, have ABSOLUTELY NO RELATION to any<br>
real world microeconomic scenarios. To make generalizations from a generalization like you are doing is the<br>
height of ignorant arrogance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If the person who bought my land from me signs my covenant, one clause in my covenant is that the buyer</i><br>

<i>&gt; which require me to do so.</i><br>
<p>
However by purchasing from Carol, you have made an implicit contract of conspiracy to defraud. You signed it with<br>
your money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Similarly, if Alice sells me a copy anonymously over the Internet, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; start reselling it anonymously, how will you ever catch me?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; While anonymous money may make a significant impact on electronic commerce, I don't think that anonymous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; production of IP will make any significant headway.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not production, but RESELLING.  I expect you see the potential NOW.</i><br>
<p>
No I see a serious retardant effect on technological advancement due to piracy losses. It is causing a serious<br>
amount of lagging between advances in hardware and advances in software, which is why we have such bloat<br>
problems. If software IP were effectively enforced, productivity gains around the world would skyrocket, and we<br>
would be bringing the singularity that much closer to reality. Killing off IP protection will kill any hope of<br>
acheiving the singularity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No, but they have contracts with their PPLs, and I have contracts with my PPL. Any reasonable PPL will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; recognise the validity of a claim upon an individual who has received stolen goods, even if the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; perpetrator cannot be found. As long as the stolen goods can be proven to posess a significant congruence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with the goods of the claimant which are documented prior to the receipt date of the stolen goods, then a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; case and claim can be made.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If I am correct about the economic efficiency of IP laws, then it is more</i><br>
<i>&gt; economically efficient NOT to recognize such a claim than it is to do so:</i><br>
<i>&gt; it would be costly to prosecute all of those people, espeically when they</i><br>
<i>&gt; use cryptography, and it would also destroy a thriving copy market without</i><br>
<i>&gt; adding enough to the incentive to invent to make this worthwhile.  And if</i><br>
<i>&gt; Friedman is right about PPAs not enforcing economically inefficient laws,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then PPAs won't hear such claims.</i><br>
<p>
Only if they are not economically efficient. I think your claims are baseless and totally wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Then you cede to the existing law. As IP law is prosecuted as civil offenses, rather than criminal offenses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (except when it involves transportation across state or national borders), you agree to most of current IP</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; law as practiced.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Er, no: I don't agree that IP law should be enforced on resellers, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather on those who broke the license in the first place; if this has</i><br>
<i>&gt; happened at all, I have not heard of it.</i><br>
<p>
Since customers are implicit conspirators in the piracy of the products they buy, they are as guilty as the<br>
original theives.<br>
