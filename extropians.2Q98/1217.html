<i>&gt;that prevent people from "stealing" it, without creating a government</i><br>
<i>&gt;enforced monopoly?</i><br>
<p>
Who is going to purchase a product no one has ever seen, on the say-so of<br>
the designer? People want to see what they are buying actually work, unless<br>
they are really stupid..<br>
<p>
Before you get paid for developing an idea like we did, you need to find a<br>
market, or develop one. After we do all the hard work, we can then produce<br>
and sell our products, or sell the rights to the patents to others, who then<br>
have the same rights.<br>
<p>
Without the patent, anyone who wants to make knock-off copies of our product<br>
is free to do so, and piggyback on our market research and development. We<br>
sweat, they gain.<br>
<p>
Anyway, it's darn hard to encrypt a mostly physical device..We don't have<br>
the replicator, yet..<br>
<p>
What is to stop anyone who wants to reverse engineer the product and tool up<br>
to make copies? Their overhead is now less by all the time spent in the<br>
original development, so they can sell for less. This would quickly dry up<br>
any investment capital for R+D of anything other than software with strong<br>
encoding. Who wants to risk development time and money if anyone is welcome<br>
to steal it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The current patent strategy is comparable to leaving your front door open</i><br>
<i>&gt;and unlocked and putting out a big sign on your front lawn saying "No</i><br>
<i>&gt;trespassers.  Violators will be prosecuted."  This strategy is more like</i><br>
<i>&gt;putting a LOCK on your door and putting a big sign on your lawn saying</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Just you TRY to get in.  Prosecutors will be violated."  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
That's why our products are potted assemblies. We want to make it as hard as<br>
possible for the knock-off artists..<br>
<p>
Even in the absence of a government monopoly, there needs to be some<br>
protection for inventors and creators - at least until 'everything' is free,<br>
and new developments are created just for the love of creation..<br>
