Sorry, I did not mean to. The questions are: Do you want to fight against<br>
"the powers that be"? Are they evil by definition? Or is there maybe a way<br>
that we can change the world by changing their worldviews? Haven't the worst<br>
mistakes in human history, most wars, only been the result of a lack of<br>
education of economic leaders?<br>
<p>
Don't preach revolution against governments, it is futile. But during my<br>
work as a journalist I have found that trying to spread the right<br>
information is *not* futile. I have written two important articles against<br>
different internet censorship approaches, which is too coordinated to be a<br>
spontaneous manifestation but must be the movement of one power group in the<br>
US. Especially the first article has generated some impact. Currently, I am<br>
researching the alleged harmfulness of pornography. This is more important<br>
than anything I have written before. You can make a change, but not by<br>
placing yourself in the long line of attackers. Try to help, not to defeat,<br>
lest you won't be defeated. Evolution instead of revolution.<br>
