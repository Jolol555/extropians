  IAN: If location is not an attribute of identity,<br>

<p>
  If identity is local and defined by location,<br>
  the identity structure of A is also non-local,<br>

  As for changing-location changing identity,<br>
  location is one feature of identity. If A<br>
  changes location fast, then A is fast.<br>
<p>
<p>
        It is the fast that <br>
        makes the slow so slow<br>
        and<br>
        it is the slow that <br>
        makes the fast so fast<br>
<p>
<p>
  If A is not changing, then A is static.<br>
  What A is, is what the identity of A is.<br>
  Virtually every physical quantity that <br>
  can be assigned to A are derived from <br>
  motion, which is location-changing,<br>
  and all are identity attributes.<br>
<p>
  A coin on the ground is not the same<br>
  as one in pocket,  if only because <br>
  the one in the pocket has a great <br>
  potential energy than the one on <br>
  the ground, since it is lifted<br>
  higher than the one on the ground.<br>
  Every thing about A is derived from<br>
  the relation of A to -A and all in -A.<br>
