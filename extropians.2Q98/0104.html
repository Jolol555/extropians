<i>&gt; From: Dan Fabulich &lt;daniel.fabulich@yale.edu&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People seem so convinced that anarcho-capitalism will collapse into nation</i><br>
<i>&gt; states.    There's no checks on the powers of PPAs, except other PPAs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What's to stop them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And I ask you again, what's to stop the US military from doing EXACTLY THE</i><br>
<i>&gt; SAME THING?</i><br>
<p>
The same thing(s) that have stopped them in the past, like the fact that most<br>
soldiers will refuse to kill their own people, including their family and friends<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; den Otter, your state has a military, yes?  What's going to stop it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; squishing your exquisite statecraft, cutting out the electronic</i><br>
<i>&gt; surveillance (at least on themselves) and surpressing the masses?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, my system would have a military, but this would not be the only armed<br>
force in the empire. There would have to be several, to provide the necessary<br>
balance. Advanced automation (within 10 years or so all tanks, planes etc.<br>
will be automated, elliminating large portions of the less reliable human force)<br>
adds to the security and control by the leaders (and the launching of heavy <br>
stuff like nukes could still require co-operation of several offices or people to <br>
prevent accidents). Messing with the robots has little use, 'cause they come<br>
in badges with different programming and coding, so you can never reprogram<br>
them all at once.<br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; dangerous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;layer of society, you will need some kind of welfare to support them. (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;free food etc. handouts I mentioned in another thread come into play here).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Release these people into anarcho-capitalism and they'll likely become</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the loyal supporters of the first would-be dictator that happens to come</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;along with promises of a better life. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Widespread unemployment takes place because wages don't adjust down, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the demand for labor falls.  Minimum wage laws are responsible in</i><br>
<i>&gt; part; labor regulations also play a major role.  </i><br>
<p>
We have minimum wage because if you would go much lower people would be<br>
starving. At a certain point, not more than a couple of decades away, computers<br>
and robots will be better and cheaper at just about *any* low-wage human job.<br>
Only an idiot would still hire people then.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Moreover, keep in mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; that these very same improvements in technology will also make the goods</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves much cheaper, allowing people to accept lower paying jobs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; still get food on the table.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, automation can make prizes drop, but if stuff gets so cheap you can<br>
sell it for virtually nothing, then why not give it away for free all the same?<br>
Besides,  a lot of people would otherwise simply have to beg to get even<br>
those couple of bucks in a highly automated world, because virtually no-one<br>
would want unreliable and inefficient people working for them if they can get<br>
a cheap, trustworthy and super-efficient robot.<br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Uhm... how do you measure the quality of a psychological profiler?  </i><br>
<p>
By the number of screw-ups he makes (how many people that were deemed<br>
"OK" by him turned out to be inadequate ?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And</i><br>
<i>&gt; more importantly, why wouldn't the politicians/military add your</i><br>
<i>&gt; surveilance-bureaucracy-reducing regulations to the round circular file and</i><br>
<i>&gt; oppress the people as they see fit?  </i><br>
<p>
Anyone who wants can spy back, and expose them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How is this more secure than</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-capitalism?</i><br>
<p>
It depends on the "good will" of fewer people. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Also, sometimes good products are suppressed </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;because they threaten the position of some big powerful company</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that happens to operate in the same niche. Only a powerful state</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;can put these things right, thus achieving a higher level of progress</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and product quality for the consumer to enjoy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I challenge you to provide even one example of such "market failures" which</i><br>
<i>&gt; was not CAUSED by a powerful state.</i><br>
<p>
You mean caused by corruption and such, the backing of malafide companies<br>
in return for bribes? This problem would be greatly reduced by strict surveillance.<br>
Also, putting techophiles in office (at least at positions where it counts) should<br>
prevent the "disappearance" (into the vaults of some company or the gov itself)<br>
of breaktrough inventions. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; When I "vote" in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; always win. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Unless you buy crap of course.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You think it's crap; but if I like it, then I win.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, but if you like it, it probably wasn't crap in the first place. I meant<br>
*real* crap, like food so full of conservatives that you'll develop cancer<br>
over time, or a television set with lousy sound etc.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm quite sure your PPAs would either</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be a minority from the start (the rest being totalitarian clans,</i><br>
<i>&gt; citystates and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;full- blown countries)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not if it takes place through a slow period of privitization.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think an initially smooth transition gaurantees anything. At a<br>
certain point a lot of governments and dictators and who knows<br>
what else will see the power they had for so long slip through their<br>
fingers. I'll be damned if not at least some of them would opt for<br>
very desperate measures to turn the tide...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or that many, possibly all, would quickly degenerate into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;flock of hardworking, meek/scared sheep ruled by an elite of enforcers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe, if they like it like that ...</i><br>
<p>
They may not really like it, but looking through history that appears to be<br>
the way things sooner or later turn out.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Logical,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;because many people are insecure, uneducated and vulnerable to any slick</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;talker or bully with a gun.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ... but just in case, there are OTHER PPAs to choose from (with their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; slick talkers) who will offer emancipation from the bullies.  Why wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; people choose that if they could?  </i><br>
<p>
Because of territorialism (and poverty), see below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;In *theory* you might move from a region if you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;like the resident PPA, but in reality it may proof too difficult/dangerous. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You misunderstand how PPAs would work.  PPAs wouldn't have their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; regions exclusively; their regions would overlap with many other available</i><br>
<i>&gt; PPAs.  </i><br>
<p>
Initially, maybe. But enforcement groups of any kind are traditionally very<br>
territorial (like gangs, who have their own city blocks) and I see no reason<br>
why PPAs would be any different. If you want to offer solid security to<br>
your customers, than you must be in firm control of the place they live<br>
in. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You wouldn't even have to leave your house to switch PPAs, just pick</i><br>
<i>&gt; up a telephone and make a deal.  Sure, perhaps your current PPA could try</i><br>
<i>&gt; to stop you... but so could the US military.  </i><br>
<p>
The US military don't give a damn about such stuff. And if you want to leave<br>
the US, that's *fine*. It's getting in that's the problem (well, theoretically<br>
then).<br>
Like I said, your military has a pretty good track record when it comes to<br>
(attempted) coups.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So could the military in your</i><br>
<i>&gt; own imagined government.  What's stopping them?  How is this more secure</i><br>
<i>&gt; than a competitive system?</i><br>
<p>
Greater size usually means greater stability. To give an example, streetgangs <br>
fight all the time, while big governments only fight sporadically, and since the<br>
advent of nukes the major ones even don't fight at all. Also, their conscience<br>
(that of the regular soldier) is stopping them from turning on their own people.<br>
In my system you could add to that mutual surveillance (the people spy back,<br>
and, for what it's worth, they have guns). In a more advanced stage of automation<br>
the key to avoid tirrany is spreading control over the enforcer robots over<br>
rivalizing<br>
institutions (that are unlike PPs part of the same system, more like different<br>
immune<br>
systems in one body than seperate bodies).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;providing mediocre yet somehow "appealing" services and taking out</i><br>
<i>&gt; competition</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;left and right by any means necessary. Such a PPA would become more like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a nation state with every takeover or alliance it achieved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what?  The US military has the means and the incentives to do exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; that; they wouldn't even have to be slow about it, because there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; competing military in the US to stop them.  So why is this so much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; secure than anarcho-capitalism?</i><br>
<p>
Because this system has proven itself, and anarcho-capitalism has (to my<br>
knowledge) yet to give a working example. If it is so great or natural, then<br>
why don't we see it all over?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;*If* you're indeed in a position to do so. I can well image that many</i><br>
<i>&gt; folks would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have debts with their PPA, just like with the mob/state etc.No way that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;will leave in one piece, and even if so what other PPA would dare/want to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;accept you in this state...unless you make even more debts and become </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in fact a slave. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And how is this different from your system?  If I've got a debt with the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; military and it decides not to let me out of the country alive, what's</i><br>
<i>&gt; stopping it from doing exactly the same thing?</i><br>
<p>
The law, backed by lots of FBI, CIA, police etc guys who don't agree (they <br>
don't have to like you but they sure want to screw those military guys).<br>
Besides, you don't usually get in debt with the military, but with some<br>
other government wing or a private organization or person. In the worst<br>
case, you'll go to jail. Now try the same stunt with the mafia-PPA and<br>
you'll wish you were in jail...In your system we'd see a lot more mob-style<br>
justice, and a lot less jail cells I suspect.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;PPAs and other anarcho-capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;goodies may be great in *theory*, but are in fact ivory tower productions</i><br>
<i>&gt; that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;don't take human nature into account and will thus fail as have many before</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd say the idea that you could check the power of the military simply by</i><br>
<i>&gt; designing a new system of laws is the ivory tower production.</i><br>
<p>
Apparently the system is doing fine even without hew laws. I sure don't see<br>
any coup d'etats in the USA...And yes, a system of checks and balances<br>
could reduce any such risk even further (in fact, that's pretty much what<br>
you have with all your special branches, secret services, police forces etc.)<br>
It seems to work OK.<br>
