Wonderful, so what are we arguing about?                        <br>

Oh. Now I see, you still think voting is a good way to make your wishes known,  <br>
I think it's idiotic.  <br>

Correct.<br>

<p>
<p>
There is another thing I don't understand, when you talk about "looting" and  <br>
"ripping off" you almost make it sound like a bad thing. That's how progress  <br>
is made, it's why everyone doesn't have to reinvent the wheel every day.  <br>
You have a good idea and start selling it, I make a few improvements and give <br>
you some competition, you like my improvements and then make some of your own, <br>
and on it goes.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;'Microsoft' is an 'artificial person.'  I don't like the way         </i><br>
<i>        &gt; MS-DOS was ripped-off from Gary Kildall's  brilliant CP/M          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Gary Kildall was an idiot, Bill Gates was not, that's why Gates became a  <br>
billionaire and Kildall didn't. In 1979 Microsoft was a computer language <br>
company not a operating system company, when IBM executives visited tiny <br>
Microsoft they made a deal to buy all of Microsoft's languages and most of <br>
their applications for their new PC. Then the IBM people said "naturally <br>
we'll want your operating system too". Gates told them they were misinformed, <br>
Microsoft had no operating system but that Kildall's company "Digital <br>
Research" did. With the IBM people still in the room Gates picked up the <br>
phone and called Kildall explained the situation and said IBM wanted to talk <br>
to him immediately. Some say Bill Gates is selfish but he offered Gary <br>
Kildall the greatest business opportunity in history and on a silver platter. <br>
Kildall blew it.<br>
<p>
Kildall said he couldn't meet with IBM now because he was leaving town on <br>
important business (what could be more important than this meeting I can't <br>
imagine) Kildall said they could talk with his wife Dorothy if they wanted to, <br>
IBM agreed. As was their custom, before anyone said a word IBM insisted that <br>
everybody sign a non disclosure agreement, Gates had signed his immediately <br>
but Dorothy panicked. She called her lawyer, he panicked. After the IBM  <br>
executives sat around the office of Digital Research for 4 hours saying and <br>
doing nothing they gave up and went home.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;IBM at that time wanted a crippled  version of CP/M          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
IBM wanted a 16 bit operating system your "brilliant" CP/M was 8 bit.        <br>
Tim Paterson, a programmer at tiny Seattle Computer Corporation got tired of <br>
waiting for the long delayed 16 bit version of CP/M and so wrote his own <br>
called QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System). <br>
<p>
Gates was horrified at Kildall's blunder because he thought it would kill his <br>
deal to sell IBM its computer languages, he was desperate to find a 16 bit <br>
operating system, then he heard about QDOS and bought it for $50,000.<br>
<p>
By the way, there is a myth that Tim Paterson became a street person and had <br>
been seen cleaning windshields with a bottle of Windex and begging for <br>
quarters. It's a wonderful story but its not true. Not long after Microsoft <br>
bought QDOS Paterson got a job at Microsoft, he's not as rich as Gates but <br>
like all early Microsoft employees he is a millionaire. For years he had a<br>
picture of a bottle of Windex on his office door. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;they [IBM] didn't want personal computing to succeeed, remember,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;partly for economic reasons (to preserve mini and mainframe sales)         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and partly for social and political reasons. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's true. As I said before, sometimes companies deliberately make an  <br>
inferior product, but it's always a disastrous policy and a wonderful  <br>
opportunity for competitors. If IBM hadn't done it Microsoft wouldn't be the  <br>
giant it is today, if Microsoft every tries it a new giant will be created  <br>
from somewhere.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The market doesn't 'reward' _anything_, except if you call people         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;impersonally following abstract price signals a matter for 'reward.'</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Don't be silly, money is a reward.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How much does a toilet cleaner, say, earn in your locality?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not much. I don't find cleaning toilets intellectually stimulating or much <br>
fun so I'd rather pay somebody who needs money more than me do it, that's <br>
what money is for. Many people have that particular skill so I don't have to <br>
pay much.      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you view States as strata title landholding companies, as </i><br>
<i>        &gt;landowners they're entitled under _anarcho-capitalism_ to set </i><br>
<i>        &gt;whatever rules of social conduct they damn well please.  You don't </i><br>
<i>        &gt;like it? So move.   </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
1) There is no place to go, States are everywhere on Earth.<br>
2) In Anarcho Capitalism  it's easy to find a landlord with rules I like.<br>
3) In Anarcho Capitalism  I could become a landlord myself if I wanted. <br>
4) Land is only a small percentage of wealth and getting smaller.<br>
               <br>

<i>        &gt;I'd be genuinely interested in learning how you adjust to Rand's         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;injunction to minimize your output. I had  real heartbreak wrestling         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;with the issue.</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
It's just a novel for heavens sake, it didn't change my life, it's not like <br>
it's something really important, like a Star Trek convention.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it is within our power to save the lives of children in Ethiopia              </i><br>
<i>        &gt; we simply choose _not to_, Don't you see _any_ moral problem here?</i><br>
            <br>
No.<br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;Is human life worthless to you?</i><br>
 <br>
No.        <br>
   <br>
<i>      &gt;If I could offer a free operating system better than Windoze and I can  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If it's better then obviously it must run hundreds of billions of dollars of <br>
existing software better than Windows, I'm eager to hear more about this <br>
marvelous new system of yours.          <br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I could never get it onto the market on any large scale.  The US         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;state would simply act to block it.      </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Even the US government is not quite that stupid, although the recent  <br>
antitrust action against Microsoft is close.<br>
