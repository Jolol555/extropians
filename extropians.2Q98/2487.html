<i>&gt;IAN: It's an interesting area of inquiry:</i><br>
<i>&gt;does the "-" negative notion equate 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the "-" logical not notion? What's</i><br>
<i>&gt;your case that "negative =/= not"?</i><br>
<p>
?not? is a universal set theoretic operator, whilst ?-? is an operator<br>
that is usually associated with Paeno systems/sets.<br>
<p>
Please don?t take the following personally, but if you (Ian) have never met<br>
these terms, I strongly advise that you familiarize yourself with<br>
elementary logic and set theory.  The fact that you are attempting to<br>
espouse a philosophy using terms grounded on set theory, logic, and<br>
analysis surely dictates that you should, at least, have a passing<br>
familiarity with these subjects.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Criterion for inclusion in "A"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; x is a part of A, IF x is necessary for </i><br>
<i>&gt;the specific existence/identity of A. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If this criterion is valid, it then follows that as: </i><br>
<i>&gt;not-A is necessary for the existence of A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;therefore, not-A is a part of A. </i><br>
<i>&gt;In the same fashion, A is a part of not-A. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IF not-A is a part of A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;IF A is a part of not-A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;THEN A and not-A have the same parts. </i><br>
<i>&gt;ERGO: A = not-A</i><br>
<p>
Wow ?.. there are so many holes in that stream of reasoning that I really<br>
can?t be bothered pointing them all out (and please, don?t ask me to).<br>
Perhaps somebody on the mailing list who has recently or is currently in<br>
the process of completing an elementary course in logic may wish to.<br>
<p>
I?ve noted that you (and others) repeatedly use terms such as ?degree?,<br>
and ?measure? - unfortunately these terms are only valid for sets where<br>
these can have meaning (such as the set of Reals).  For example, for the<br>
set of operators O = {+, -, *}, where O is not a Paeno set, what is the<br>
difference between {+} and {-} ? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;?.. So A = -A and does not = -A at the same time in </i><br>
<i>&gt;different contexts. When mystics say A = -A (or</i><br>
<i>&gt;something to that effect) they are referring to </i><br>
<i>&gt;a primordial context that maps the structure of</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity. So what is this "mystical" context?</i><br>
<p>
To state that  ?A = -A?, where the context of the left side is different from<br>
the context of the right side is logically invalid, and is an abuse of the ?=?<br>
sign.  According to this fashion of reasoning, I could prove that Mary is a<br>
man because all jeans are worn by men (in Italy), Mary is wearing jeans<br>
(in New Zealand), therefore Mary is a man!  I'm sorry, but ...... I don't think<br>
so. <br>
<p>
However, your ideas have some merit - the set U = { A } is an extremely<br>
boring set, especially if any operators performed on U must result in a<br>
member of U! Things only begin to get interesting once we have U = {A,<br>
B}, from which we could derive boolean algebra and ascribe A the<br>
?meaning? true and B the meaning ?false?.<br>
<p>
I could go on (and on), but I think I?ve spent too much time on this already. <br>
Unless you expound your ideas and concepts in a considerably more<br>
rigorous manner, you will find that your ideas will continue to cause<br>
conflict without coming to any conclusion on the validity of your<br>
viewpoint.<br>
