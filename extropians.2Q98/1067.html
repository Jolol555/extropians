<i>&gt; ---Oddity---</i><br>
<i>&gt; It rained for 40 days and 40 nights. ? How is this possiable? was </i><br>
<i>&gt; there enough moisture in the air at that time to produce that much </i><br>
<i>&gt; water?</i><br>
<p>
That's not the worst of it.<br>
<p>
It rained so much as to cover the mountain (and don't forget that the <br>
fountains of the earth opened up to help out).  That would be <br>
Everest, which according to my almanac (I found the damn thing <br>
again) is 29,028 feet above sea level.<br>
<p>
It did this in only 40 days and 40 nights = 960 hours.  The water <br>
level rose at an average of 363 inches per hour.  Even if only 10% of <br>
that is rain (the rest being from the fountains of the earth), that's <br>
a yard of rain an hour.  A heavy Midwestern rainstorm delivers maybe <br>
four inches an hour.<br>
<p>
With a yard of rain an hour, Noah didn't need an ark.<br>
<p>
He needed a submarine.<br>
an ark.<br>
