But information is a thing, and this is not just an esoteric nit pick, it's <br>
very practical. The Internet search engine companies provide information <br>
about information, that's all they do, yet they're the hottest thing on <br>
Wall Street, their stock price has gone to the moon in the last year.<br>

                   <br>

Without information there would be no such definition, nobody around to  <br>
appreciate it, and nobody to debate what has the most of it.<br>

Perhaps, but Science is about experiment and there is no conceivable <br>
experiment in which you could prove that to be true.<br>
