Well, not "hardly any", but a lot less than you'd expect.  This actually<br>
does work.  When you eat virtually no carbohydrates your citric acid cycle<br>
fails and your body switches to an alternate fat oxidation system.  Your<br>
body has to ship large quantities of fats in ketones around in the blood.<br>
Since your kidney lack the ability to retain these, they get lost in the <br>
urine.  The situation resembles that of somebody with advanced diabetes,<br>
although this kind of ketosis won't kill you directly.<br>
<p>
You can lose weight like crazy on this plan.  You will also be physically<br>
weak,<br>
often nauseous, and you will smell like nail polish remover.  If you go<br>
on the diet and then off it, you will gain back all you lost.  If you stay<br>
on it, you'll subject your body indefinitely to a metabolic regime it's <br>
manifestly not adapted for.  Research on the long-term safety of ketotic<br>
diets is zilch, which I consider inexcusable given than Dr. Atkins has been<br>
pushing this diet for 25 years.  Not even a rodent study!  Dr. Atkins' diet<br>
may be a good thing, but he is a quack.<br>

I've always wanted to get a ketotic diet proponent in a room with a vegan<br>
to watch the fireworks :-)<br>
<p>

<p>
No doubt they do exaggerate, but you will lose a lot on the Atkins diet.<br>
In addition to substantial fat loss, ketosis is a strong diuretic and you'll<br>
lose a lot of water as well.  Of course, you'll get the water back within<br>
24 hours of your first candy bar.<br>
