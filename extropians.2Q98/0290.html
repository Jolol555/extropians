<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I like it, Scott, and that's not to disparage the other definitions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; others may have offered, but it kind of ties in with a Randy-Smith</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; truism:  many, if not most, humans are, in some fundamental way,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; unhappy. That ultimate state of self-actualization would seemingly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; If we were not unhappy, there would be zero impetus to change. No</i><br>
impetus<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; to change in an coevolutionary context guarantees failure before long.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Very odd. I feel very happy, and I feel a big impetus to change. Would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I feel an even more intense impetus if I was unhappy? I doubt it; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; times I have felt unhabppy haven't motivated me as much as when I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; been happy to do something.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I must second that; I'm a *lot* more productive and looking for improvement</i><br>
<i>&gt;when I feel happy than when I'm depressed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Of course, I might be unrepresentative of humanity</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course, I *know* I'm unrepresentative of humanity, so... ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

Yes, but are you now happy to stay at the level you are at?  What if further<br>
growth was prohibited? Would you become unhappy then?  I think you might.<br>
Actually satisfied might be a better term than happy.  It is true that<br>
depression brings on lethargy, mainly because of a sense of hopelessness.  I<br>
think many of us are happy precisely because we are changing and growing.<br>
Stifle us and watch us wither on the vine.<br>
<p>
Anders made the additional point that people have different ideas about what<br>
growth is.  But the particular path one might choose may not be as important<br>
as our drive to walk down it.<br>
