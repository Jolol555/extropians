<p>
Well, MINE for one.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Your definition of atomism desribes a meta-rela-</i><br>

<i>&gt;    tion of identity, atomist or holist, and thus </i><br>
<i>&gt;    is not a standard by which the "right" or the </i><br>
<i>&gt;    "wrong" defintion is to be determined. So:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    * Why is "atomist identity" as defined by the 3 </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Laws of Thought a "wrong" definition of atomism?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    (Our disagreements revolve around definitions, </i><br>
<i>&gt;    and it seems that we agree on everything else.)</i><br>
<p>
Well, it's basically this problem: lots of people consider themselves<br>
atomists (myself included!) because I believe that one can define the<br>
identity of A in terms of its relationship to only PART of its holistic<br>
identity and still make sense.  More precisely, I'd say that identity of A<br>
(as defined by holism) is governed by *everything* that is not-A; but the<br>
atomist's definition of identity (which I'll call partial identity to<br>
avoid confusion) is simply the relationship between A and a particular<br>
other value; usually 0.  The net identity is the sum of the partial<br>
identities of everything relative to everything else, which is always 0.<br>
<p>
In the previous world consisting of A and B, we can see that one partial<br>
identity is that A is one greater than 0 and another is that B is two<br>
greater than zero; the latter partial identity may change without<br>
affecting the truth of the former partial identity: B may grow to twenty<br>
greater than zero, but A will remain one greater than 0.  Since 0 will<br>
become twenty less than B in the process, the whole identity of A will<br>
change, eventually leaving the net identity zero.  However, the truth of<br>
partial identities are not necessarily affected by changes in other<br>
partial identities, and thus, to some extent, partial identities are<br>
"atomistic" in the sense that they exhibit some degree of independence,<br>
even though the total identity cannot behave in this way, and even though<br>
the identity of the partial identities themselves will be affected as that<br>
which is not-"partial identity"  changes.  The important thing for<br>
atomists is that the truth of a partial identity can remain unchanged by<br>
the truth of other partial identities; perhaps truth itself is just a<br>
partial identity of any given statement.<br>
<p>
This is useful in many cases where I don't know certain values on the<br>
identity matrix, but I can nonetheless say things about the partial<br>
identities I do know; I may even use the fact that net identity is equal<br>
to zero in order to find unknown values on the table.  As you can see,<br>
this is totally compatible with holism, and yet smacks of atomism.<br>
<p>
So my definition, in the clearest form you'll get from me at this hour:<br>
Atomism is the statement that the truth of partial identities does not<br>
necessarily change as other partial identities change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: I think your accusation is in error! Cutting </i><br>
<i>&gt;    to the quick: here again our difference is one of </i><br>
<i>&gt;    definition. Your defining "mystical" as "a statement</i><br>
<i>&gt;    about LESS than all data," such as 0 = 1. Based on </i><br>
<i>&gt;    that you then construct a series of matrices with </i><br>
<i>&gt;    obviously illogical information and then conclude </i><br>
<i>&gt;    that the "mystical" must be illogical. Yes! But</i><br>
<i>&gt;    if, and only if, your definition is THE definition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    My definition of "mystical" is "a statement about </i><br>
<i>&gt;    the unity of ALL data." Based upon that, I then</i><br>
<i>&gt;    construct a matrix that defines ALL identities</i><br>
<i>&gt;    and sums them into a statement about ALL things.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    So the real question here is: Why is a definition </i><br>
<i>&gt;    of "mystical" as "a statements about not-all things"</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the right definition of the "mystical" ? As I said,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I think we agree on all else but two definitions.</i><br>
<p>
Well, here I must fall back on utility:  when we use words to<br>
communicate, the best words are those which are the best mutually<br>
understood by the parties to whom we are communicating.  Adopting a<br>
commonly held definition makes communication easier and makes you better<br>
understood by others.<br>
<p>
When most people say "identity" they mean partial identity; similarly when<br>
they say "space" they mean partial space, and when they say "time" they<br>
mean partial time.  If the best definition is that which is best<br>
understood, you are better off saying that identity, space and time can<br>
all be non-zero (again, meaning partials) but that the sum of all<br>
identities relative to all other identities is zero and that this is the<br>
whole truth.<br>
<p>
Similarly, when people refer to mysticism, they usually intimate something<br>
which is not predicted by Newtonian physics actually taking place.<br>
However, as we can clearly see, your theories of identity and Newtonian<br>
physics go hand in hand; you cannot use the identity matrix to prove<br>
that psychic phenomena are possible or that reality is infinitely<br>
malleable by the human mind or that 0 = 1; all of these are popular<br>
conclusions of mysticism as practiced and defined by others.  This reason<br>
alone may be sufficient reasoning to abondonit.<br>
<p>
If this has not been sufficiently convincing for you, this e-mail exhange<br>
may be sufficient evidence that using another person's definitions is<br>
useful: to be blunt, I would never use the word "Identity" with anyone<br>
else in the same way I use it when talking with you; only by reading your<br>
web site, by understanding your matricies and ultimately adopting your<br>
definitions, have I even begun to convince you that we atomists aren't so<br>
bad after all.  (A task which a series of great minds on this list have<br>
apparently tried and failed to do.)  I must admit, I balked when I read<br>
your conclusions that there was no identity, no space and no time; when I<br>
understood that you were using a different definition of identity, time<br>
and space than most, however, the theories followed; at the same time it<br>
has allowed me to demonstrate that some form of atomism is compatible with<br>
holism; but again, not according to the definitions which you hold, but<br>
only by creating a new term "partial identity" which I tried to use to<br>
sneak past your mental defenses against anything atomist. <br>
<p>
By adopting the definitions of your "opponent" while remembering the whole<br>
truth, you can gain a better understanding of their position, and are also<br>
more convincing with your own position.  You might even discover that<br>
you're saying the same thing. <br>
