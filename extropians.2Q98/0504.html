&lt;&lt; One thing that is problematical is how to transverse fault lines such as in<br>
 California. Large caverns with articulated guide tubes have been mentioned.<br>
 I read about this a few years back, but i don't remember where.<br>

It seems it would be a lot safer and cheaper, and cooler(to look at) if it<br>
were above ground.  Underground has problems with earthquakes and oceans and<br>
whales in the oceans.  I was just thinking about a transportation device<br>
similar a couple weeks ago, using big strong, cheap plastic tubes (clear tubes<br>
would be really cool, especially if you're going fast (300+), with super-<br>
lightweight crafts, and just use air to blow them.  It would require stations<br>
every few miles (maybe 1 or 50) to add additional charges. But these could go<br>
super fast if they were light weight.  The charges wouldnt require too much<br>
energy im  sure if they were built right. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For a vehicle in orbit, whether it's above or below ground, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;force on it that would require rails, etc. for guidance. In reality, some</i><br>
<i>&gt;sort of maglev would probably be used to ensure the car remained centered</i><br>
<i>&gt;inside the tube.</i><br>
<p>
what is a maglev?  Like magnets? I had thought about that in middle school,<br>
tubes with crafts suspended with magnets, then I heard they use it in Japan<br>
kinna, for their trains, I guess the trains float on the rails.<br>
<p>
Also, how long would it take fo a craft to get into orbit in a tube? could it<br>
be bursted into orbit like within a few miles?<br>
