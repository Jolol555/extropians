<i>&gt;&gt;   Since there is never an instance of atomism, we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   exactly say H = A only in that H always is and A never </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   is. The process of inquiry must discover what is and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   what is not, and I posit that atomism always is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Here "atomism" refers to the idea that identity is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   atomized such that the identity of A comes only from </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   A and not from -A. I posit that such is never true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think we disagree as to what atomism signifies.  Atomism is making a</i><br>
<i>&gt;statement about the actual values on the identity diagram, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;about their sum.  For example, on your site you give two objects, A and B,</i><br>
<i>&gt;where B is one greater than A.  If I add 0 to this mix, we get the</i><br>
<i>&gt;following identity matrix:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    0   A   B</i><br>
<i>&gt;0   0  +1  +2</i><br>
<i>&gt;A  -1   0  +1</i><br>
<i>&gt;B  -2  -1   0</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When atomism states that A can change independently of B, it means that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;changes relative to 0, and that this does not affect B relative to 0.  For</i><br>
<i>&gt;example, if A increases by three relative to 0, we get the new chart:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    0   A   B</i><br>
<i>&gt;0   0  +4  +2</i><br>
<i>&gt;A  -4   0  -2</i><br>
<i>&gt;B  -2  +2   0</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That this change is possible is trivially true; that it is compatible with</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomism is also true.  Not even atomism claims that something can change</i><br>
<i>&gt;relative to itself, but rather that it changes relative to 0.  Note that</i><br>
<i>&gt;this does not affect B relative to 0 (+2), or 0 relative to B (-2), which</i><br>
<i>&gt;was all that atomism was trying to prove anyway. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: "A" changes relative to 0 as 0 changes<br>
   (taking on the attribute of -4) relative <br>
   to A... this is holism. Also B does change<br>
   after A changes: before, B was the largest<br>
   entity, then it became the smallest entity. <br>
<p>
   The relation of B to 0 is constant just as <br>
   the relation of me in my moving car is con-<br>
   stant. This "constant" is constant as derived<br>
   by relation from something that is not-constant,<br>
   such as the area outside my car that is changing.<br>
<p>
   If atomism is defined as A, where the identity of<br>
   A is derived from A, but not both A and -A, then<br>
   no example of atomism has been evidenced. The ob-<br>
   servation that A does not change relative to a<br>
   non-changing relation is trivial and not atomism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;...What I'm trying to say is that under the mystical</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience, the difference between 0 and 1 is zero, NOT that the sum of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the difference between 0 and 1 and the difference between 1 and 0 is zero. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The latter is trivial; the former is mystical.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: To sum the parts is to define the whole.<br>
   The mystical experience defines the whole and<br>
   the whole relation of A to -A. To prohibit the<br>
   summing is to prohibit the mystical insight.<br>
<p>
   If we wish to prohibit the summing, we are nega-<br>
   ting the holistic relation it defines. To negate <br>
   that relation is to define A relative to A, and <br>
   the differential relation of A to A = 0. So the <br>
   "not summing" where A = 0 you call the mystical <br>
   insight is true, for "not sum" is not-holism,<br>
   or: the relation of A only to A.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Zero may also be defined as "symmetry."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   If there is asymmetry, it is what it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   relative to symmetry, and that's symmetry!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   So there can never be not-symmetry in all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Er, *I* don't define 0 as symmetry, and I don't think it's valid to do so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sure, symmetrical things will sum to zero in the way you describe, but you</i><br>
<i>&gt;commit a fallacy of parts to say that just because two numbers sum to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;value that both are that value.  This is like saying that since 1 + 2 = 3,</i><br>
<i>&gt;1 = 3 and 2 = 3.  Clearly this is not true; but in the same way, if 1 + -1</i><br>
<i>&gt;= 0, you cannot say that 1 = 0.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: All the identities you cite, 1, 2, and 3 are <br>
  what they are relative 0, as you agree.  The nature <br>
  of this relation is symmetrical summing to zero. The<br>
  mystical insight defines the whole, or the sum, of <br>
  the relations of all things among themselves.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: I think that your saying that if holism always</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   is, such that there is no not-holism, this is atomism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   i.e., there is H and H is H free from not-H.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On the contrary, I am simply saying that H = A, a conclusion which you</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagreed with earlier but which I assert.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Where is the entity, A, that is <br>
   what it is free from relation to -A? <br>
