<p>
  IAN: Yes! But the point is that what we assume is <br>
  atomism is in fact holism, and atomism NEVER exists.<br>
  If we just say A = A or even just A, that letter is <br>
  defined by the area surrounding it, which is -A.<br>
<p>
  Since there is never an instance of atomism, we cannot<br>
  exactly say H = A only in that H always is and A never <br>
  is. The process of inquiry must discover what is and <br>
  what is not, and I posit that atomism always is not.<br>
<p>
  Here "atomism" refers to the idea that identity is <br>
  atomized such that the identity of A comes only from <br>
  A and not from -A. I posit that such is never true.<br>
<p>
  If I'm wrong, then show me atomism doing something.<br>
  I believe it cannot be shown that atomism exits.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;Your presumption that A + -A = 0 somehow proves the mystical experience is</i><br>
<i>&gt;hogwash; the mystical experience is that A = -A because A = 0 and A- = 0. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: If identity is difference, then A = 0 and -A = 0,<br>
  where each are differentiated from themselves, which <br>
  is to say that the difference between A and A = 0.<br>
<p>
  If identity is difference, then A is A only by differ-<br>
  entaiton from -A. Lo and behold, the sum of that rela-<br>
  tion also = 0. We cannot segment that relation into <br>
  two separate parts without each becoming 0, and <br>
  yet together they are also 0... in sum. But<br>
  that sum, or union, is what they are dictated<br>
  by the fact that they cannot exist free from it.<br>
  So the "mystical insight" is always the whole truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The mystical experience demands that all things are all things, not that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the sum of all things is zero. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To show that the mystical experience holds true, you must show that 1 IS</i><br>
<i>&gt;0, not that the sum of the identity of 1 and not-1 is the same as the sum</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the identity of 0 and not-0 (which is trivially true), but that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity of 1 is equal to the identity of 0.  Similarly, showing that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sum of the differences in location with respect to multiple objects is</i><br>
<i>&gt;zero is again trivial; the mystical experience demands that all such</i><br>
<i>&gt;values actually BE zero.  Same goes for time.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Your analysis is one of the most skillful<br>
  I've encountered and shows that you have a rare <br>
  level of comprehension of what I'm saying, wow!<br>
  Most responses express only not-understanding.<br>
<p>
  The showing of "all such values actually being <br>
  zero" is the fact that "self to self = 0," that<br>
  is, that the difference/identity of A to A = 0,<br>
  which holds for every thing. Each thing gets a <br>
  non-zero identity only by giving the opposite<br>
  non-zero to another thing (or empty space) and <br>
  the sum of that relation is the same as the self<br>
  to self relation. So there is never not-zero.<br>
<p>
  Zero may also be defined as "symmetry."<br>
  If there is asymmetry, it is what it is <br>
  relative to symmetry, and that's symmetry!<br>
  So there can never be not-symmetry in all.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, as an example of atomism working, I posit: everything holism predicts.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I think that your saying that if holism always<br>
  is, such that there is no not-holism, this is atomism,<br>
  i.e., there is H and H is H free from not-H. The short-<br>
  fall in that counter is that "the whole" is no thing, <br>
  it is not a subset, not an atom. Atomism is the con-<br>
  cept of a subset free from the whole. The whole is<br>
  itself free, it sums to zero, since there is nothing<br>
  to measure it against, it is a subset of no larger <br>
  or other thing. It is therefore an expression <br>
  of holism: if no not-A then A = 0.<br>
