But you haven't explained HOW they would do this.<br>

Non-sentient AI should certainly be able to handle those tasks.<br>
<p>

I do not see why there should be any instances where labor has a comparative<br>
advantage over capital.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Every time you add a sentient robot to the work force, you are adding</i><br>

<p>

<i>&gt;no obvious reason why we should even want it to stop.</i><br>
<p>
That's insane!  You're talking about a population bomb that's organically<br>
built into your economic system!  Anyhow, whether you like it or not, economic<br>
growth will stop whenever you run out of raw materials and energy -- in<br>
economic terms, when you run out of "land".  Then you will have a solar system<br>
crammed full of dirt-poor consumers and no hope of a better life.  Malthus<br>
vindicated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No.  Non-sentient beings don't buy anything.  They have no demands.</i><br>
<p>
That's what I like about them.  Let's go back to our root principles again...<br>
Any economy is a system for distributing limited resources among people with<br>
unlimited (?) needs and wants.  Adding more resources to the system is<br>
helpful.  Adding more needs and wants to the system is HARMFUL.  So, adding<br>
non-sentient robots is ideal: it increases the available resources without<br>
increasing the total needs and wants.  (Actually, non-sentient robots have<br>
some needs, but no wants.  And when a non-sentient robot is no longer useful,<br>
it can be destroyed and recycled, which could not be done to a sentient robot<br>
for ethical reasons.)<br>
<p>
We have been conditioned to think that adding workers to the economy is<br>
helpful, because they tend to produce more than they consume.  This would also<br>
be true of sentient robots, at least until you reach your limits of growth.<br>
However, non-sentient robots have a greater advantage.  Because they have no<br>
WANTS, they will consume much less than the sentient robot while producing<br>
just as much.  The net gain for the economy is much greater!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Non-sentient robots don't buy goods.</i><br>
<p>
This is a benefit, as I outlined above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Non-sentient robots don't buy goods; and *because* they don't buy goods,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they don't add to the demand for jobs, so they don't CREATE jobs,</i><br>
<p>
GOOD!  I don't WANT to create jobs, I want to ELIMINATE jobs!  There is<br>
nothing sacred about jobs.  There is no reason why our economy should be based<br>
upon work, or why jobs should be equated with wealth.  At least you haven't<br>
shown me any reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And as I've been trying to tell you, more consumers DO make us better off,</i><br>
<i>&gt;by creating more jobs for us to fill.</i><br>
<p>
How does "creating more jobs for us to fill" make us better off?  Please<br>
explain this connection, because I sure don't see it!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not, but then, the qualitative distinction between sentient and</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-sentient is vague at best.  I'd say that when you've got robots that</i><br>
<i>&gt;create art, you're definitely toeing the borderline of sentience.</i><br>
<p>
Art is based on emotions.  This reminds me of that other post about an AI<br>
quoting Martin Luther King on TV.  How do you distinguish an AI that has<br>
human-like emotions from one that's merely pretending to?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a purely economic standpoint, my definition of sentience is very easy: a</i><br>
sentient being is one who /wants/ things.  A consumer.  Aside from that, I<br>
don't care how competent they are.  For maximum economic leverage, robots<br>
should be non-sentient in the sense that they don't want anything for their<br>
own comfort or enjoyment.  There's nothing in that definition that precludes<br>
them from being artists.<br>
<p>
Maybe art shouldn't even be done for economic reasons!  Perhaps art should be<br>
the province of non-workers who make their living by other means, so they can<br>
indulge their creative urges without worrying about the bottom line.  Are you<br>
happy with the output of Hollywood these days?  Do you like walking into a<br>
bookstore and finding whole shelves of Star Trek novels?  All those newly<br>
minted cyber-capitalists, freed from the burdens of work,  will have a lot of<br>
time on their hands to indulge artistic hobbies.  It might result in a<br>
renaissance!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;admitted that I don't want to work; why should I want my children to?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So they can add to their own wealth as well as the wealth of others.</i><br>
<p>
There are certainly other ways they can do that, rather than by working.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So they can reap the rewards of their own investments.</i><br>
<p>
This does not require work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So they can learn to manage finite resources.</i><br>
<p>
This does not require work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So they can create jobs which other children can fill.</i><br>
<p>
Circular logic...  I should want my children to work so that my grand-children<br>
will have an opportunity to work?  You seem to be proceeding on the basis that<br>
work is desirable for its own sake.  I strongly disagree with that!  Work, by<br>
its nature, is unpleasant: otherwise we wouldn't require wages for performing<br>
it.  Labor performed for it's own sake is a hobby.  I'm all in favor of<br>
hobbies, as long as I don't have to work for a living.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So they can learn to deal with others on a voluntary basis.</i><br>
<p>
This does not require work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Shall I go on?</i><br>
<p>
By all means!  Maybe you'll hit upon something valid.<br>
