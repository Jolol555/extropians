<i>&gt; Though I appreciate you responding to it, I'm not sure my definition is as</i><br>

<p>
(the day we get transhumanist heresies, that day I quit; however, there<br>
are certaily *mistaken* transhumanist ideas in need of correction :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But, it does appear that we have a hierarchy or needs and when the</i><br>
<i>&gt; baser one are met, we "tend" to seek to meet higher order needs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; this appears to be a trans-cultural phenomenon.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder if this is true in general? While it is a common phenomenon,<br>
it seems that there are so many possible higher order goals we can set<br>
up that it is not clear that the goals involving getting mental and<br>
physical tools for further self-actualization will be the most common,<br>
let alone dominant. There are plenty of people who begin to strive<br>
after what appears to be dead-end goals which prevent further growth,<br>
such as a constant passive mystical state. But I think you have a<br>
point in that a large fraction of people would, if all their basic<br>
needs were met, likely start developing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I think it's what</i><br>
<i>&gt; truly sets us apart from the other life forms on the planet.  We're</i><br>
<i>&gt; just not satisfied with homeostatic routines.  In a way, we embody</i><br>
<i>&gt; the very forces of evolution that brought us here on both an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual and a societal level.</i><br>
<p>
We are in some sense underdefined, we can consciously set up our own<br>
goals and act on them, and this undermines homeostatic<br>
routines. Fortunately.<br>
