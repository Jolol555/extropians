Depends on how you interpret the sentence.<br>
<p>
As our control of disease and aging becomes perfect, and we become <br>
significantly more reliably nice to each other, accidental deaths <br>
will approach 100% of all deaths, as opposed to its current level <br>
of... um... 10%?  That's quite an increase.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Let's say you would normally live 100</i><br>
<i>&gt; years and you are risk-aversive to the degree that you have a 1% chance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dying an unnatural death over the length of your life-span.  If you then</i><br>
<i>&gt; become able to live for 200 years and maintain that same level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk-aversiveness, then (all other things being equal) you will still have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1% chance of dying an unnatural death.  It's just that 1% of 100 is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; one-half of 1% of 200.</i><br>
<p>
Incorrect.  You would have a 1% chance of dying an unnatural death IN <br>
YOUR FIRST 100 YEARS!!!<br>
<p>
Ignoring the safety-enhancing effect of maturity and experience, if <br>
you survive the first 100 years you would have a 1% chance of dying <br>
an unnatural death in your second century.  That's a combined 1.99% <br>
chance of dying an unnatural death.<br>
<p>
(In reality, your chances of dying an unnatural death in any given <br>
year are rather higher from birth through age 25 than at a later <br>
ages; and presumably the rate continues to decline until the <br>
eyesight- and reflex-weakening effects of age counteract the <br>
advantage of increased knowledge and experience.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And if your life was extended indefinitely (to infinity), there would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1% probablity times infinity (equivalent to 100% probability) that you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; die of an unnatural cause eventually (even if you significantly reduced your</i><br>
<i>&gt; exposure to risk).  Am I right people?</i><br>
<p>
It isn't multiplicative.  It's exponential, and the proper way to <br>
express it is the chance of *not* dying of an unnatural cause, which <br>
is .99 (the chance per period) to the power of the number of periods <br>
in question.  Given enough periods, the chance is arbitrarily close <br>
to zero but never actually reaches mathematical zero.<br>
