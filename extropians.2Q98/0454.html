<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This doesn't make sense to me.  Longer life spans would not increase the</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;dying an unnatural death over the length of your life-span.  If you then</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;become able to live for 200 years and maintain that same level of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;risk-aversiveness, then (all other things being equal) you will still have</i><br>
a<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;1% chance of dying an unnatural death.  It's just that 1% of 100 is only</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;one-half of 1% of 200.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;And if your life was extended indefinitely (to infinity), there would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;1% probablity times infinity (equivalent to 100% probability) that you</i><br>
would<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;die of an unnatural cause eventually (even if you significantly reduced</i><br>
your<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;exposure to risk).  Am I right people?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think this would apply only in an individual case. The previous post</i><br>
seemd<br>
<i>&gt;to consider more than one person.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you look at a population, rather than an individual, the frequency of</i><br>
<i>&gt;accidental deaths to natural ones must rise as the average lifespan</i><br>
<i>&gt;increases, unless you also have a corresponding increase in safety.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can't conceive of living in a totally risk-free environment - no spice in</i><br>
<i>&gt;life! We all must decide for ourselves what constitutes an acceptable risk.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course, I would not welcome risk due to another person's attempts to</i><br>
<i>&gt;relieve HIS boredom!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Chuck Kuecker</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I respectfully disagree.  Especially when you consider a population, the<br>
probability of an unnatural death does NOT increase.  If the population<br>
decided to take more airplane rides than normal per year per person, then<br>
the frequency of accidents would increase as a function of the number of<br>
flights.  If, on the other hand, the overall level of risk-aversive behavior<br>
reamins the same, the frequency of accidents will not increase as a function<br>
of time.  Look, the simple way of saying this is that if you live twice as<br>
long, you'll have twice as many accidents.  That's not the same thing as<br>
saying the accident "frequency" increases. If something happens once/year<br>
and you're around one year, then odds are you will see it happen once. If<br>
you're around two years you'll see it happen twice. The frequency hasn't<br>
changed. Is that clearer?<br>
