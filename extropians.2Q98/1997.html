Sure.  And atomists will gladly concede that.  Newtonian physicists<br>
agree that all motion is relative to something; all atomism is trying to<br>
say is that the relation of B to our arbitrarily defined 0 does not change<br>
when the relation between A and 0 changes.  This is really a trivial<br>
point, and one with which I happen to know that you don't disagree.<br>
<p>
You think atomism states that A is what it is free from not-A.  This is<br>
not true; atomism states that A's relationship to zero does not affect B's<br>
relationship to 0.  That's all.  Your definition is wrong, your point is<br>
right, and so is atomism when defined correctly.  Move on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    If atomism is defined as A, where the identity of</i><br>
<i>&gt;    A is derived from A, but not both A and -A, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;    no example of atomism has been evidenced. The ob-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    servation that A does not change relative to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;    non-changing relation is trivial and not atomism.</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary; it is trivial and it IS atomism; indeed, that is ALL that<br>
atomism is trying to say.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;    IAN: To sum the parts is to define the whole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    The mystical experience defines the whole and</i><br>

<p>
I would never prohibit anyone from arithmetic;  whether to add or not to<br>
add is a personal choice with which it is not mine to interfere.  ;) <br>
Rather, I argued that the fact that net identity sums to 0 does not prove<br>
mysticism; I'm fine with the summation, but find the ultimate argument<br>
invalid.  I demonstrated that there is a non-trivial difference between<br>
saying that 0 = 1 and that 0 + -0 + 1 + -1 = 0.  I assert that because you<br>
do not support the statement that there is 0 difference between one and<br>
zero that your proof is not mystical, but trivial.  That you left this<br>
point off of your reply is telling. <br>
<p>
I'll say it again:  A mysticist would agree with both of the following<br>
identity charts:<br>
<p>
   0  1         0  1<br>
0  0  0  and 0  1  1<br>
1  0  0      1  1  1<br>
<p>
because there is zero difference between one and zero.  You do not; you<br>
clearly see that there is one and only one chart which can be created in a<br>
universe which consists only of a 1 and a 0:<br>
<p>
   0  1<br>
0  0 +1<br>
1 -1  0<br>
<p>
and that the two charts above are completely wrong.  You see that 0 is not<br>
equal to 1, and therefore you have shown that mysticism is FALSE, not<br>
true.<br>
<p>
&lt;sidepoint&gt; As for your point that "to sum the parts defines the whole," I<br>
think we can see, by using holism, that that's the biggest crock of shit<br>
the world has ever seen.  The sum of the mysticist's chart is 0; the sum<br>
of your chart is 0, yet the mysticist's chart is wrong and yours is right; <br>
there is a non-zero difference between the two charts.  Yet there is zero<br>
difference between 0 and 0.  There is no difference between the sums, and<br>
a non-zero difference between the charts; therefore, the sum of the<br>
elements on a chart does NOT define the chart, and therefore the sum of<br>
parts does not necessarily define the whole.&lt;/sidepoint&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    If we wish to prohibit the summing, we are nega-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    ting the holistic relation it defines. To negate </i><br>
<i>&gt;    that relation is to define A relative to A, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;    the differential relation of A to A = 0. So the </i><br>
<i>&gt;    "not summing" where A = 0 you call the mystical </i><br>
<i>&gt;    insight is true, for "not sum" is not-holism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    or: the relation of A only to A.</i><br>
<p>
Again, not-summing is not what I suggest.  Rather I argue that the sum<br>
does not successfully prove your point.  The sum of the mysticist's<br>
identity chart is 0; the sum of your identity chart is zero, and yet there<br>
is a non-zero difference between your identity chart and the mysticist's<br>
identity chart.  Therefore, the fact that your true chart sums to 0 does<br>
not prove that the mysticist's chart is true, even if it also sums to<br>
zero, because your chart is different from the mysticist's chart, despite<br>
the fact that the sums are the same.  I'm repeating this point several<br>
times in order to make this really really clear: your chart does not prove<br>
the mysticist's chart, and therefore does not prove mysticism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: All the identities you cite, 1, 2, and 3 are </i><br>
<i>&gt;   what they are relative 0, as you agree.  The nature </i><br>
<i>&gt;   of this relation is symmetrical summing to zero. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;   mystical insight defines the whole, or the sum, of </i><br>
<i>&gt;   the relations of all things among themselves.</i><br>
<p>
That does not in any way challenge my point that the fact that 1 + 2 =3<br>
does not prove that 1 = 3 or that 2 = 3, nor does the fact that A + -A = 0<br>
prove that A = 0 or that -A = 0.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: Where is the entity, A, that is </i><br>
<i>&gt;    what it is free from relation to -A? </i><br>
<p>
Nowhere, so it's a good thing for us atomists your definition of atomism<br>
is completely wrong.  Atomism does not claim that A is what it is free<br>
from -A.  Atomism claims that the relation of A to 0 does not affect the<br>
relation of B to zero.  That's the whole point, right there, hook line and<br>
sinker.  No atomist will try to press you further on this point; if you<br>
agree with the above, you agree with atomism, because this is the true<br>
definition of atomism.<br>
<p>
You must unlearn what you have learned, Ian: atomists AGREE with you. <br>
We're not claiming that A is what it is free from -A.  We're making a much<br>
more trivial claim.  Never again should you argue that A is defined by -A; <br>
even the atomists agree with that.  We are making a much smaller point. <br>
You should understand this, accept that you have been fighting your own<br>
straw man, and move on.<br>
