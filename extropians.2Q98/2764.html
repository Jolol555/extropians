  Pardon me if this is not completely timely. I get the digest version  <br>
of the list once a day.As such, I would appreciate any responses be <br>
cc'ed to me at barnebee@biosys.net <br>
<p>
  While I agree that the governmental systems that are currently <br>
invading our privacy, and will increase in doing so, are problematic, <br>
they are the knee-jerk reaction of people who believe in power-over. The <br>
Heinlein quote is "Any society populated enough to require ID's is <br>
headed towards decline". It's very true. I believe you will see magnetic <br>
strips, centralized Databases, infobuttons (see dallas semiconductor), <br>
smart cards, and soon, DNA scans and chip implants. Given the state of <br>
most industrialized societies (especially amerika (sic)) it is <br>
inevitable that the government will attempt to restrict, and track what <br>
freedoms are afforded to the masses. The purpose of a government is to <br>
restrict individual freedoms to insure societal continuation. Given the <br>
heterogeneous nature of American society, more governmental restriction <br>
is an inevitability.<br>
<p>
   Fortunately, we (I include the members of societies such as <br>
extropians) are not the masses. Any system that can be designed by <br>
people, can be overridden by people. If you are concerned that you might <br>
be one of the individuals in an upcoming pogrom, do something about it. <br>
Encrypt everything. Join the EFF or other groups dedicated to preserving <br>
privacy in the system. Write (continuously) to people in power critizing <br>
them for their actions which hurt privacy in the system, and <br>
complementing them for making appropriate decisions. As a last resort, <br>
expatriate yourself to a country or place with strict privacy laws.  <br>
<p>
   It is necessary to realize that most of the individuals making <br>
decisions (particularly in America) don't have a through understanding <br>
of the issues involved in building an information society/economy. {Newt <br>
Gingrich has his email printed out so he can read it, and he is one of <br>
the most cyber-savvy on the hill}<br>
<p>
   As we change from an industrial to an information society, the <br>
socioeconomic stratifications of the society are changing from the <br>
have/have nots to the knows/know nots. Given that this is true, the <br>
knows group is going to be the focal group of any power structure <br>
wishing to control the society. To quote an old friend of mine, Daniel <br>
Glesenkamp "Be uncomfortable: be sand, not oil, in the machinery of the <br>
world". As extropians, transhumanists, et all, we are all aware that all <br>
of life is (should be) based on conscious decisions of will. If you <br>
disagree with things that your government is doing, work to change it, <br>
or work around it. As much as repressive totalitarianism frightens me, <br>
the American government is not one at this time, and mechanisms do exist <br>
to make your voice heard, especially for the cyber-savvy. Use them. If <br>
you truly feel that this is unattainable or counter productive, utilize <br>
the resources available to us to change your situation so that your can <br>
be perceived to conform while preserving the privacy you so crave. <br>
Heinlein again (paraphrased )--Rubbing blue mud in your belly button, if <br>
that is the societal norm, may be necessary. You don't have to believe <br>
in it--.<br>
<p>
   The bottom line is that most of us are smarter than most of them. <br>
That implies power. If we utilize this empowerment to create power-with <br>
in our society, the tantalizing possibility exists to create a utopia <br>
rather than a "Brave New World". <br>
<p>
            I'm sorry if this has been a bit long winded, but I couldn't <br>
resist getting up on my soap box on this one.<br>
<p>
                     Thanks,<br>
