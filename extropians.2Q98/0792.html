I tried reading the entire New Testament, and was appalled at the things<br>
that are supposed to be taken for granted by the reader. The way life back<br>
then was described was unreal. It almost reads like some sort of satire..I<br>
gave up somewhere in the middle.<br>
<p>
The Old Testament reads like bad science fiction mixed with soap operas,<br>
with a bit of Conan the Barbarian thrown in.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;aren't christians kind of odd they follow a jewish man, who even the </i><br>

<p>
All religions are odd in some way. Some are more genteel than others,<br>
though. Fundamentalists of any stripe tend to be extremists in all their<br>
dealings, I find..<br>
