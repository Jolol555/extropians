your current PPA is only being tyrannical in the fact that it makes you<br>
pay an amount that you don't want to pay, so you are going to switch to<br>
another system which makes you pay more!?<br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which means that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the potential profit for that other PPA is lower than the current profit</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Once I have made the decision to switch PPAs, my current PPA gets no profit.</i><br>
<p>
You don't have that decision.  To make it more explicit, the PPA i'm<br>
talking about acts in a simmilar way to governments, they tax you.  you<br>
have no option<br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which means that your current PPA will spend more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;money keeping you than the other PPA will in trying to "free" you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I'm prepared to spend more money for a more liberal PPA, this whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument goes straight out the window.</i><br>
<p>
since liberal in this case is how much you have to pay them, then you<br>
can't be prepared to spend more money, it only makes it worse<br>
