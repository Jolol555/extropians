Well, I didnt pretend to give a complete treatise for all existing<br>
religions. Of course, you`re right, this is not a very satisfying<br>
explanation if you want to go and look into the stuff more intensively.<br>

I remind people like Archimedes - I don`t think he was religious... at least<br>
he didn`t try to explain the world by religion. Citizens like him criticized<br>
the old myths and tried to help the people understand.<br>

I don`t really believe those new explanations are definitely the better<br>
ones, and I don`t think anyone can say that. The "riddle" "why is there<br>
something rather than nothing" hasn`t been solved yet, and I think, it won`t<br>
ever be solved by science. I know you`ve got a different opinion.<br>

Do you really believe this? Some kind of myths and religion might have been<br>

<i>&gt;contrasts greatly with Buddism for example, where the question of origin is</i><br>

I`m not sure about that.<br>
