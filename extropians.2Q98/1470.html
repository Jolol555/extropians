<i>&gt;Here we go with yet another space question, which im not sure if its a</i><br>
<i>&gt;popular one of not but one i have always been curious about and hope</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone can shed some light upon it. It is a fact that space is</i><br>
<i>&gt;constantly expanding and at what rate im not sure. What i question is</i><br>
<i>&gt;what is space expanding "into". when a balloon expands it expands into</i><br>
<i>&gt;air, takes up "space". after we eat taco bell our stomachs "expand" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;take up "space". but when SPACE expands does it take up more SPACE? does</i><br>
<i>&gt;space make its own space to expand into, at a faster rate than it</i><br>
<i>&gt;expands? maybe its something obvious im not sure, but would sure like</i><br>
<i>&gt;some insight if anyone cares to reflect.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
My understanding (admittedly quite limited) is that the universe cannot be<br>
considered to be expanding *into* anything.  It's just expanding.  It's not<br>
like there's a border and on one side is our space-time-matter world while<br>
on the other there's something else.  Our minds just can't wrap around the<br>
idea of nothing.  But what I don't get is the volume of space in our<br>
universe keeps increasing as it exapnds so where does the extra *space* come<br>
from? Space is not nothing, right?  Space can be distorted (by mass) so is<br>
it stretching?  Is more being created somewhere?  Smart people...help the<br>
less fortunate here.<br>
