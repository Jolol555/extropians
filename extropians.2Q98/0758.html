 YW&gt; The reason they can convert matter to energy but somehow find it<br>
 YW&gt; easier to transport the matter is because shows about networks of<br>
 YW&gt; self-replicating seeds don't exactly hold the fish-like attention<br>
 YW&gt; span of your average audience.  <br>
<p>
There are other reasons why TV tends to lag years (if not decades) behind SF<br>
literature.  It's hard to introduce new concepts on a TV show.  You can't stop<br>
and spend 10 minutes explaining something.  So, SF concepts tend not to reach<br>
TV until after they've already penetrated the cultural consciousness.  You<br>
can't do a show about alternate worlds until most people already understand<br>
the concept of alternate worlds.  That's why we haven't seen any shows<br>
featuring nanotechnology in a meaningful way.<br>
<p>
I've seen shows that /mention/ nanotechnology in passing, using it basically<br>
as a buzzword.  Most of them seem to think a nanomachine is some kind of<br>
artificial virus.  Ironically, the one TV show I've seen that was reasonably<br>
accurate in depicting and explaining nanotechnology was an episode of<br>
Gargoyles.  Yes, Gargoyles!  It's a children's animated series from Disney.<br>
In this one episode a large part of the Australian outback was overrun by<br>
gray goo, which rather resembled a self-replicating utility fog.<br>
<p>
It's sort of like the 1920s when many people sneered at the idea of<br>
spaceflight, or simply didn't understand it.  Yet, there was the Buck Rogers<br>
comic strip with surprisingly well thought-out depictions of how spaceflight<br>
could work.<br>
<p>
 YW&gt; questions, what's the current timeframe for nanotech and/or<br>
 YW&gt; immortality, I remember Drexler had some figures for this (didn't<br>
 YW&gt; he say that anyone under 40 has a good chance of immortality in<br>
 YW&gt; _Engines of Creation_ back in the early 80's?)  I'm currently<br>
 YW&gt; feeling very sceptical about everything.<br>
<p>
Well, the timeframe is the big question, isn't it?  I will say this...  I<br>
think nanotechnology is at the same awkward stage that spaceflight was in the<br>
1920s and 1930s.  The technology doesn't exist yet, but it's visible on the<br>
horizon to those few who are inclined to look.  The basic principles are<br>
understood.  So the question is, when are we going to get the nanotech<br>
equivalent of an A-4 rocket?  Based on the historical pattern, I would guess<br>
about 20 years.  But there are so many variables...<br>
<p>
I've known some people who said with a straight face that it would be more<br>
like 200 years.  I don't believe that, but I can't prove them wrong either. <br>
After all, researchers have been saying commercially viable fusion energy is<br>
"about forty years away" for decades now.<br>
