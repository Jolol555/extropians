&lt;interesting arguments on the benefits of sacking people snipped&gt;<br>
<p>
In the current Australian case, it isn't that simple.  We're not talking<br>
about unskilled people being replaced by machines to do the hod-carrying.<br>
Stevedoring is already a fairly skilled business.  For what it's worth,<br>
here are some comments from an article in The Australian, our major Murdoch<br>
newspaper (quoted without permission of the writer, Mike Steketee):<br>
<p>
`The Government has enforced the principle that union membership should not<br>
be a requirement for working on the wharves... but...at a significant<br>
cost... security guards and savage dogs dragging employees from their<br>
workplaces in the middle of the night.<br>
<p>
`This was heavy-handed action, accompanied by a sneaky shuffle... of<br>
corporate assets to try to escape liability [of breach of Act] which<br>
prohibits the dismissal of employees because they are union members.  Its<br>
success in terms of public acceptance relies on Australians being persuaded<br>
by the demonisation of the wharfies in which the Government has engaged.<br>
<p>
`In truth... they have accepted change, including a more than halving of<br>
their numbers as a result of reforms - achieved by negotiation... <br>
<p>
`So what mortal sin have the wharfies committed to warrant their wholesale<br>
sacking?  It boils down to an hourly container movement rate perhaps 25 per<br>
cent below world's best practice (bulk cargo rates are already at the<br>
international benchmark, though that did not stop Patrick employees in<br>
these areas getting the sack as well).  This is an improvement worth<br>
having, but does it require such brutal action?'<br>
<p>
Mike Lorrey might be correct that this is mercantilism rather than<br>
capitalism.  I can't say, not being a theologian.  But it sounds to me<br>
rather like guns against heads in one of the advanced non-communist nations<br>
of the First World.  (Do note that I am not saying anything about the<br>
merits of stevedores as wonderful caring human beings, nor trying to deny<br>
their own record of thuggish intimidation, theft, industrial sabotage. etc.<br>
 I am simply responding to the claim that capital operates differently from<br>
socialist state enforcement.)<br>
