<i>&gt;A little recommended reading... Freeman Dyson has a few words to</i><br>

<i>&gt;books addresses the issue. However his central argument concerns</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Judeo-Christian tradition of theology--descended from the </i><br>
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <br>

Thanks Sean I'll keep my eye's open, but as we've already discussed<br>
and you pointed out above, scientific reasoning predates<br>
christianity. Just one example, Aritosthanes, the head of the great<br>
library of Alexandria, computed the circumference of the earth<br>
within 5% in 399 B.C.. I could easily make the case the the Muslims<br>
did far more to promote scientific reasoning. (i.e. Algebra is a<br>
muslim word.) I remember one instance from the James Burke series<br>
"The Day the Universe Changed", he was talking how the christian<br>
forces had "liberated" a library in Cordova Spain, it contained<br>
400,000 volumes, more than in all of France, and was one of 72<br>
libraries in town. The transfer of these books after the fall of<br>
Moorish Spain is what ignited the Renaissance. <br>
