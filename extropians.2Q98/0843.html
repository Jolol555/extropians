Summary: Paul is concerned about the economic impact<br>
of total automation on humanity. I respond that<br>
total automation implies transhumanity, so he should<br>
refocus his question to the transhuman era or to<br>
the transition era.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'm not a radical free marketeer, but I do have opinions on this<br>
subject. You want answers? Here they are, and worth every penny<br>
you paid for them :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) Is there a single field which is intrinsically safe from automation</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the course of the next 20-30 years?  If you can think of more fields,</i><br>
<i>&gt; please elaborate.</i><br>
<p>
Even the most "conservative" singularitans place the singularity<br>
before the year 2030. IMO, unaugmented humans will be completely<br>
economically obsolete. Your questions should therefore be directed<br>
at the economy of transhumanity, and perhaps the economics of the<br>
transition, because there will be no human economy.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Are these remaining fields if any, sufficient to employ the majority</i><br>
<i>&gt; of humanity?  If not, what will the rest of humanity do in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; survive?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The best humanity can hope for is that transhumanity is altruistic,<br>
If so, then transhumans will help humans become transhumans.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  For those who are unemployed and do not have sufficient investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; income, is death the inevitable result?  If not, how will they survive?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
See above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4) Will most people alive today be able to save enough before their jobs</i><br>
<i>&gt; become automated?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 5) If how much money one has saved is the the key to surviving</i><br>
<i>&gt; automation, does this not portend very badly for young people who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; had less time to save for their forced retirement?  If this is true,</i><br>
<i>&gt; does this mean that the future is going to be populated almost entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt; of rich and old people and their children?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
There is a real possibility that technology will evolve more rapidly<br>
than<br>
the financial system can react. If your savings consist of productive<br>
assets, then the value of your savings can disapear if the assets become<br>
obsolete. I'm not an economist, but as I understand it the amount of<br>
money you have represents your share of the economy's productive assets.<br>
This is more obvious when your savings are shares of stock, but remains<br>
true in any event. Very rapid increases in productivity caused by<br>
nanotechnology or AI may have the effect of a dramatic deflation. If<br>
so, the rich may not be in much better shape than the poor: Your money<br>
is useful only as feedstock for the nanotech, with exactly the same<br>
value as dirt. On the other hand, the necessities and luxuries of<br>
life will be essentially free, so who cares? On the third hand, you<br>
will be transhuman, so there is no way that a simple human such as<br>
myself can judge whether this will make you happy.<br>
