IMO, uploading will require a large increase in computing capacity<br>
just to run the upload, plus major advances in fields like<br>
neurophysiology. Many of the uploading methods we have discussed<br>
here depend on nanotech to derive the state of the meat brain for<br>
flash uploading or to provide the interconnection for gradual<br>
uploading. If you think uploading will precede nanotech, you will<br>
have to develop a non-nanotech solution to one of these problems.<br>
<p>
By contrast, nanotech is a much easier problem. In "Nanosystems",<br>
in 1992, K. Eric Drexler described diamondoid nanotechnology<br>
rigirously, and sketched out an implementation  path via<br>
wet chemistry less rigorously. The number of problems to solve<br>
along this path is miniscule by comparison to uploading problems.<br>
Furthermore, the current rapid pace of research in nanotubes gives<br>
us what appears to be a simpler path to diamondoid nanotech.<br>
Therefore I would vote for nanotech first and uploading second,<br>
except for one little thing:<br>
<p>
There is the potential for "spontaneous order" and other emergent<br>
behaviour of complex systems to create a superintelligence based<br>
on the current internet, together with some unpredictable additional<br>
factor. This might occur precipitously, as a "phase change"<br>
rather than as a build-up. If so, the resulting SI may complete<br>
the development of nanotech and use it for uploads at what<br>
appears to humanity to be the same time.<br>
