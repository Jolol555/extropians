Anton Sherwood presented counter-argumentation <br>
against holistic-identity theory, arguing that <br>
its proponent, myself, is confusing two types <br>
of identity, vernacular and logical. These are<br>
the definitions Anton gave for these identities:<br>
<p>
 Vernacular identity: property of a thing.<br>
<p>
 Mathematical identity: relation between a <br>
 thing and itself or between two equal things.<br>
<p>
Examples of the properties of a thing (which<br>
fall into the category of vernacular identity) <br>
are its color, size, speed, shape, and weight, <br>
all of which are derived from holistic relation,<br>
which can be defined as "relative difference."<br>
<p>
But Anton alleges that there is another kind<br>
of identity that is derived from self-relation.<br>
Requests for examples or evidence of such iden-<br>
tity have been answered only with examples of <br>
relations between different things. NO example <br>
of a "mathematical identity" (a thing that is<br>
itself free from anything else) has been shown.<br>
<p>
The reason that no example of a "mathematic<br>
identity" can be shown may be explained by the <br>
fact that any tangible variety of identity is<br>
a product of the relations of differing subsets, <br>
and thus measurable identity is difference, not <br>
"same as." Therefore, the only identity that <br>
exists pertaining to self-relation is zero <br>
identity, is no, or null, identity.<br>
<p>
We can see this expressed perfectly in the <br>
identity matrix, which defines the attributes <br>
of the identities of the entities across the top<br>
relative to the entities along the left side: <br>
<p>
<p>
               1  2  3  4  5<br>
              _______________<br>
           1 | 0  1  2  3  4 |<br>
<i>             |               |</i><br>
           2 |-1  0  1  2  3 |<br>
<i>             |               |</i><br>
           3 |-2 -1  0  1  2 |<br>
<i>             |               |</i><br>
           4 |-3 -2 -1  0  1 |<br>
<i>             |               |</i><br>
           5 |-4 -3 -2 -1  0 |<br>
             -----------------<br>
<p>
<p>
3 has the attribute of 2 relative to 1, and by<br>
symmetry, 1 has the attribute of -2 relative to 3.<br>
Wherever a "0" appears, there is "self-relation."<br>
The measure of identity that an entity attains by<br>
relation to itself is zero, zip, nada, null, no-<br>
thing, or void. Therefore, what Anton has defined <br>
as "mathematic identity" is nowhere to be found.<br>
<p>
But this "0" is still important. It means that the<br>
self-relation of anything to itself is equal to the<br>
self-relation of any other thing to itself and of <br>
all things to all things (since the sum of all the<br>
attributes in the matrix equals 0 -- the difference <br>
between "all difference" and "all difference" is 0; <br>
and therefore, difference is, as a rule, conserved).<br>
<p>
This is the central structure of the conservation <br>
of identity. So Anton's "mathematic identity" IS <br>
valid in a profoundly holistic sense, and it is <br>
the center piece of radical holism: zero mechanics.<br>
