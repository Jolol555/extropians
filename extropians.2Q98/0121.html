<i>&gt;         &gt;simmilarities between the current system and PPA based         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;anarcho-capitalism as you described it </i><br>
<i>&gt;               </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; PPA's are profit motivated, Nations are power motivated. </i><br>
i would say nations are profit motivated, but the boundary between profit<br>
and power is not very clear cut.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nations have a  </i><br>
<i>&gt; geographical location , PPA's do not. </i><br>
Not by definition, but they would very probably become localised since<br>
weaponry is localised.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's easy to change PPA's, it's not </i><br>
<i>&gt; easy to change nations. </i><br>
It's easy to change nations if they let you, it would not be easy to<br>
change PPAs if they didn't let you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; PPA's membership is voluntary, Nation citizenship is </i><br>
<i>&gt; not. </i><br>
again, as above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; PPA's settle differences with arbitration, Nations prefer force.  </i><br>
most nations settle through negotiation, wars are rare.  yes, negotiation<br>
involves force, but so too would arbitration (the more powerful PPA could<br>
select an arbiter closer to its likings).  Wars only come when the sides<br>
don't agree on their relative strength, this happens with nations as well<br>
as with PPAs (as well as with humans and animals).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nations claim powers individuals lack, PPA's don't. </i><br>
<p>
why not?  are you trusting the PPAs to be "good" entities?<br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The holocaust or the inquisition could just as well happen as with         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the current nation-states, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please explain to me how a PPA consisting of 40 million Germans, even </i><br>
<i>&gt; assuming they all decided for some reason to join the same one, would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful enough to kill 6 million Jews. Explain why even though it means </i><br>
<i>&gt; their life the Jews would not be willing to pay a premium seven times as high </i><br>
<i>&gt; as their German neighbors pay their PPA.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
I'm sure the germans were spending more than 14% of their GDP on their<br>
army, which, if you translate to PPA, it would make it impossible for the<br>
jews to put as much money (&gt;100%) (they would have to stop at much less,<br>
since<br>
other necessities such as food and shelter would consume some of the<br>
money).  But there would be no need for all germans to join the same PPA,<br>
just the part that would count (ie the bit that has 80% or so of the<br>
wealth) which would probably account for 10 or 20% of germany.  You could<br>
probably do it with the top 1% of germany, but i don't have hard numbers<br>
to back this up, the other claims are probably quite a bit on the<br>
safeside.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;By the way, last time I checked there were close to a billion         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Indians not 10 million                        </i><br>
<i>&gt;        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;huh?  what's that got to do with the price of fish?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you're an Indian fisherman and you think that big bad Bill Gates is out to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; get you and that your 10 million member PPA is too small and weak to protect  </i><br>
<i>&gt; you, then join a bigger stronger one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
but you can't afford it.  A PPA would not take you if it thought you would<br>
be more costly to keep than what you pay, and since with your pitiful<br>
income you can't pay jack, then your PPA, if you can afford any at all,<br>
would be extremely weak. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;War is expensive for both sides.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Your PPA doesn't have to fight anyone if no other PPA tries to         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"rescue you".           </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;And no other PPA will try          </i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
<i>&gt; No.             </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;because they know that your PPA gets a higher profit from you than         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;they would </i><br>
<i>&gt;               </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what? I don't know or care how much the psychotic PPA is extorting from </i><br>
<i>&gt; you, it's completely irrelevant to me, all I need to know is that your money  </i><br>
<i>&gt; is good and you want to buy my services at my going rate. I also know that if </i><br>
<i>&gt; I let the psychotic PPA  get away with this outrageous behavior I will lose </i><br>
<i>&gt; other customers. My fellow PPA owners agree with me completely and have </i><br>
<i>&gt; offered to help.       </i><br>
<p>
on the contrary, it's very relevant how much the other PPA is extorting<br>
from you, since how much you they will spend on keeping you depends on<br>
this figure, and how much you will have to spend to fish the guy out<br>
depends on that figure.<br>
why would you loose other customers?<br>
