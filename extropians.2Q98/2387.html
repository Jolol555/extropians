How disturbingly knee-jerk of you. Do you think that after almost 2000<br>
years, we can make any judgements about what these guys were *really* like?<br>
If so, it would seem that you concur with the fundamentalists wrt the<br>
inviolability of [manually written and transmitted] scripture, something to<br>
which anyone with a reasonable background in modern information theory<br>
would give the big hairy eyeball.<br>
<p>
I'd love to get my homey Hay-zoos's and m'man Mo's *real* swing on things<br>
like the role of government in the lives of individuals, the possibility of<br>
physical imortality, and the place of personal spiritual knowledge in a<br>
world wakened to rationality. If nothing else, you know these guys must<br>
have been capable of holding their own in serious debate - I'm sure they<br>
saw a lot of it, especially early in their careers. Imagine someone like<br>
them getting turned onto the ideas expressed on this list - Zowie!<br>
<p>
And man, that Jesus could throw some *serious* parties - wine flowing from<br>
the taps, spreads of food that keep getting bigger as the night goes on,<br>
and everyone washing each others feet. Sounds like a time and a half ;^P<br>
