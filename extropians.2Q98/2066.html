No question about that. 100 is the average IQ. However today the actual IQ<br>
average is close to 103 to 104. The average IQ is going up.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, here is part of an e-mail message I just received from a<br>
student:<br>
_________<br>
Dear Dr Lewis,<br>
    I was missing 2 more points to get a B grade.  There is anyway that<br>
you would give me up a B, please.  Because, I am getting scholoship next<br>
semester.  So would you very please.  Thank you very much Dr. Lewis, U<br>
really appreciate.  <br>

I assume this is a student trying to make a good impression!<br>

<i>&gt;Here is an excerpt from a posting I made to the list October 14, 1995:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I just received my November Scientific American, and found a fascinating</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; article about the "Flynn effect" (page 12).  "In the early 1980s, while</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; studying intelligence testing in the U.S. military, Flynn found that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; recruits who were merely average when compared with their contemporaries</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; were above average when compared with recruites in a previous generation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; who had taken exactly the same test....  Flynn found that scores on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; virtually every type of IQ test - administered to military recruits and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to students of all ages - had risen roughly three points per decade since</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; they were first instituted in the U.S.  Flynn learned that 20 other</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; countries for which sufficient data are available... showed similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; increases.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "The gains ranged from 10 points per generation, or 30 years, in Sweden</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and Denmark to 20 points per generation in Israel and Belgium.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; upward surges tended to be greatest for tests that minimize cultural or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; educational advantages by probing the ability to recognize abstract</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; patterns or solve other non-verbal problems.  Flynn has recently analyzed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; scores from Raven's Progressive Matrices, which is considered to be one</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of the least 'culturally loaded' IQ tests.  The birth dates of those</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; examined span a century, ranging from 1877 to 1977.  Flynn concluded that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; someone scoring in the 90th percentile 100 years ago would be in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fifth percentile today."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; That means that someone who was better on this test than 90% of people a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; century ago would be worse than 95% of people today!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The article goes on to say that elderly people score poorly on IQ tests</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not because they've gotten dumber as they get old, but because everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; did so poorly on those tests when they were young.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Several explanations are rejected, among them that people today are more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; experienced at test taking (fewer people take tests today than in some</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; past days), that it is a matter of more education (education hours have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fallen in some countries), that television is making people smarter (the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; phenomenon long predates television), and that better nutrition and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; medicine have improved health (studies have not found much correlation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; between nutrition and IQ).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would not assume that people are stupider today than in the past, unless</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have actually interviewed people who lived many decades ago.</i><br>
