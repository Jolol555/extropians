Erik Moeller:<br>
<i>&gt;Heterosexuality is a very important concept, both for reproduction and</i><br>
<i>&gt;socialization. Zoophilia, homosexuality, pedophilia, all these are</i><br>
<i>&gt;likely to have evolutionary origins, but I cannot see a possible use</i><br>
<i>&gt;for intersexuality.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't equate biological genital forms with philias--clinically,<br>
the two don't relate to each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think you take the word 'evolution' to literally here. It seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be used a lot on this list instead of the dreaded and passe 'progress'</i><br>
<i>&gt;or 'development'.</i><br>
<p>
I did mean evolution! I don't have to go too far to project<br>
'evolution' in the biological sense (chromosomal) or in the<br>
transhumanist sense (biological change aided by technology) in the<br>
case of intersexual humans.  Due to the vast progress made in<br>
reproductive technologies, intersexual humans are now able to pass on<br>
their genetic structures to their offspring. A recent study has<br>
claimed that a group of non-mosaic Kleinfelter's males were able to<br>
procreate through an advanced method of in vitro. This means that,<br>
for the very first time, their chromosomal structure is passed on to<br>
offspring.  And when cloning is honed to the point of feasibility for<br>
humans, any human can at least replicate.  This is why the topic of<br>
gender continues to fascinate me--it is an arena in which evolution<br>
takes place before our very eyes.<br>
<p>
Anders:<br>
<i>&gt;I would rather say intersexuals might be important since their</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence undermines the traditional (and IMHO unhealthy) binary view</i><br>
<i>&gt;of gender.</i><br>
<p>
And that would constitute the sociobiological aspects.  We can<br>
reasonably project that, given absolute freedom to choose, many<br>
intersexual humans would prefer to retain the biological form they<br>
were born with.  The increasing existence of humans that cannot be<br>
classified physically at either polarity is going to force many<br>
societies to reconsider the custom of segregating humans by gender<br>
in various spheres of activity.  It will also call into serious<br>
question the notion that biology determines life roles or<br>
personality.  I like to think of that as socio-evolution, but<br>
it's just a useful metaphor.<br>
<p>
Erik:<br>
<i>&gt; OK, so you believe that the kid's identity is impaired after</i><br>
<i>&gt; "fixing" his sexuality. Are there any psychological studies supporting</i><br>
<i>&gt; this view? </i><br>
<p>
Not a case of belief, but of mounting evidence.  In addition to the <br>
one Anders cited, a longitudinal study is in progress at Johns <br>
Hopkins.  <br>
