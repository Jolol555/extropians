I support a peer review process for journal publication, but not for <br>
compiled anthologies.  Many anthologies contain articles that have been <br>
previously published in journals, and thereby subjected to a review <br>
process.  But some of the most outstanding anthologies I have read <br>
contain material that it would be awkward to impose that sort of <br>
process on.  How do you peer review a poem?  A personal essay?  <br>
<p>
One of my favorite anthologies, Bi Any Other Name, began as a personal <br>
project by two people who wanted to see certain material published that <br>
other publications were rejecting because it was too 'radical' (sound <br>
familiar?)  The two editors saw the quality of this work when no one <br>
else did, and the result was a groundbreaking book that did not sell <br>
well at first but has now become the 'bible of bi-ness' and is included <br>
in many academic curricula.<br>

<i> &gt; I think its a valuable idea. Id like to suggest that the editors of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; book might consider publishing the essays in the book after first</i><br>
<i> &gt; sumbitting them to several peer reviewers. For instance, the Max Moore's</i><br>
<i> &gt; paper on PCR makes all sense to me, and I think a similar one should be</i><br>
<i> &gt; included in a book like that, but it could be prudent to first send it to</i><br>
<i> &gt; several philosophers, and whose field is epistemology at that.. Its just an</i><br>
<i> &gt; example, I dont think anybody would find anything wrong with that</i><br>
<i> &gt; particular paper, its just no other essay comes to my mind right now. At</i><br>
<i> &gt; worst, such process helps just polishing the style, at best, to pinpoint</i><br>
<i> &gt; any bugs which might be there. </i><br>
