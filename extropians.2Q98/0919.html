What is their alternative?  Sounds to me like anarcho-capitalists don't give a<br>
damn about the poor ~80% of the world!  In several days of hashing out these issue<br>
out on both the transhuman-list and now the extro-list, not a single person has<br>
been able to come up with a free-market alternative.  They conclude that either we<br>
will have to work like dogs until the end, or if we're very lucky, compassionate<br>
transhumans will give the rest of us a hand up as we approach the singularity.I<br>
have always liked the idea of a minimum guaranteed income and others similar to<br>
it. Unfortunately Damien, you appear not to be a rabid free-marketeer, and my<br>
challenge was to *them* to come up with a solution.  So far they have failed to<br>
so.<br>
<p>
****  So again I ask, is their any anracho-capitalist who can demonstrate how the<br>
free-market can support and sustain a wide-spread liesure-class society without<br>
resorting to "faith" that it simply will.  If your conclusion is that we must all<br>
continue to work in some form or another, then I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!<br>
