<p>
Right, of course.  This all makes sense under your definition of control.<br>
However, as noted, I maintain a different definition of "control."  And<br>
again, remember that I'm using MY definition in quotes, to keep them<br>
distinct...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;- From a utilitarian moral standpoint, I put forward that "coercion"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(which, according to axiom 1, is characterized by a lack of "control")</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is not. Actually, there is *only* coercion, but there are different</i><br>
<i>&gt;degrees and types of it.</i><br>
<p>
... which it seems you forgot here.  Of course everything is coercive when<br>
there is no control.  However, as you should also be able to see, there is<br>
"non-coercion" under my definition of "control."  I really do understand<br>
your point, even if I disagree with it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I put forward that under your definition, the atheist IS coercing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;believer; but that this is irrelevant from a moral standpoint,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Depends on the degree and the consequences of the coercion.</i><br>
<p>
See my point about morality below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;C</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.2) Axiom: Destroying the fundamentals of others' can damage their psyche</i><br>
<i>&gt;and thereby reduce their well-being.</i><br>
<p>
THIS, I think, is the axiom over which we most disagree.  *I* would say<br>
that if a person desired to listen and thereby have their fundamentals<br>
destroyed, and they did so, then they would actually be BETTER off as a<br>
result, because they got what they desired.  (By axiom A2.2.)  I would go<br>
on to say that since your axiom does not seem to take this into account,<br>
you have an entirely different system of moral value than I do.  As you may<br>
have already noticed, I am a utilitarian, and believe utility to be<br>
intrisically valuable.  What, precisely, is your theory of morality?<br>
<p>
(As a side note, I'm pleased to see that we're so rigorously challenging<br>
each other's assumptions in this debate...  it helps keep the mind alert.)<br>
<p>
I've snipped the further discussion aboubt whether you're allowed to<br>
critique here as I'm waiting for someone to reply to the "ANTI:" point.<br>
Also, I'll reply to your "cult" post later today.<br>
