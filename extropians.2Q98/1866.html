Abstract<br>
  STUDY OBJECTIVE--The aim was to explore the magnitude and causes of the<br>
  differences in mortality rates according to socioeconomic<br>
  position in a cohort of civil servants. DESIGN--This was a prospective<br>
  observational study of civil servants followed up for 10 years after baseline<br>
  data collection. SETTING--Civil service offices in London.<br>
  PARTICIPANTS--11,678 male civil servants were studied, aged 40-64 at baseline<br>
  screening between 1967 and 1969. Two indices of socioeconomic position were<br>
  available on these participants--employment grade (categorised into four<br>
  levels), and ownership of a car. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Main outcome<br>
  measures were all cause and cause specific mortality, with<br>
  cause of death taken from death certificates coded according to the eighth<br>
  revision of the ICD. Employment grade and car ownership were independently<br>
  related to total mortality and to mortality<br>
  from the major cause groups. Combining the indices further improved<br>
  definition of mortality risk and the age adjusted relative<br>
  rate between the highest grade car owners and the lowest grade non-owners of<br>
  4.3 is considerably larger than the social class differentials seen in the<br>
  British population. Factors potentially involved in the production of these<br>
  mortality differentials were examined. Smoking, plasma<br>
  cholesterol concentration, blood pressure, and glucose intolerance did not<br>
  appear to account for them. The pattern of differentials was the same in the<br>
  group who reported no ill health at baseline as it was in the whole sample,<br>
  which suggests that health selection associated with frank illness was not a<br>
  major determinant. The contribution of height, a marker for<br>
  environmental factors acting in early life, was also investigated. Whereas<br>
  adjustment for employment grade and car ownership attenuated the association<br>
  between short stature and mortality, height<br>
  differences within employment grade and car ownership groups explained little<br>
  of the differential mortality. CONCLUSION--The use of social<br>
  class as an index of socioeconomic position leads to underestimation of the<br>
  association between social factors and mortality, which may<br>
  be reflected in public health initiatives and priorities. Known risk factors<br>
  could not be shown to account for the differentials in<br>
  mortality, although the degree to which this can be explored<br>
  with single measurements is limited.<br>
