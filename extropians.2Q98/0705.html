<i>&gt; the pyramid image is everywhere, heres a site:</i><br>
<i>&gt; www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/4698/</i><br>
<i>&gt; it looks a lot like a pyramid, and even if its not a pyramid it definately</i><br>
<i>&gt; looks like just one rock, or mountain.  That image looks like it might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; modified, but there are links to the original photo, from that site.</i><br>

The northern part of that pyramid was imaged in the very first Cydonia<br>
strip, at the very bottom, below the "face".  It looks like the edge of<br>
a hill, a completely natural object.  I like to use the mirror site at<br>
<a href="http://www.mars.sgi.com/mgs">http://www.mars.sgi.com/mgs</a> for the latest images.<br>
<p>
I share the sense of surprise and disappointment that the Face fans<br>
are continuing to maintain that the new pictures show evidence of<br>
artificiality.  I thought people would have more integrity than that.<br>
No doubt it is difficult to abandon the idea after investing so many<br>
years in it.<br>
<p>
Richard Hoagland's web site at <a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com">http://www.enterprisemission.com</a> has new<br>
blowups of the Mars Global Surveyor images which claim to show structures.<br>
But surprise, they are once again at the very limits of detail in the<br>
new pictures, even though these have many times the resolution of the<br>
old ones.  No matter how close you get and how well you see, there is<br>
always going to be a limit beyond which things get fuzzy.  It is in that<br>
realm, where the imagination can roam, that Hoagland lives these days.<br>
<p>
As an amusing aside, there was a minor controversy over the weekend<br>
when a caller to the Art Bell radio program claimed to be a former JPL<br>
employee who was fired when he accidentally caught sight of pictures which<br>
proved that JPL was covering up the reality of a Martian civilization.<br>
However, the caller, "Kent", was tripped up by Hoagland, who had his<br>
phone call analyzed by David Oates, a so-called "reverse speech expert"<br>
(<a href="http://www.reversespeech.com">http://www.reversespeech.com</a>).  Oates plays the audio backwards<br>
and attempts to pick out English words in the eerie-sounding noises.<br>
He claims that you can find out what people are really thinking as they<br>
subconsciously tell the truth in their reversals.  Using this technique<br>
Oates and Hoagland decided that Kent was lying, and when he was confronted<br>
he admitted the fraud.<br>
<p>
Talk about the blind leading the blind.<br>
<p>
The third and last Cydonia image will be taken today and released<br>
on Friday.  No matter what it shows, Hoagland and company will no doubt<br>
find more to feed their fantasies.<br>
<p>
Hal<br>
