<i>&gt; From: "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin" &lt;warrl@blarg.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;When people cite that example, I often wonder what their intent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is.  When I inquire, I usually find they are citing it as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;example of the technically superior system falling to an inferior</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;system with better marketing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But on closer examination I find that Beta's technical superiority</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;over VHS has no significance in context; while VHS early on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;developed a critical technical superiority over Beta, that was not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;matched until it was too late to help.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh? Next to a Betamax, VHS looked like someone drawing with dull</i><br>
<i>&gt; crayons, it wasn't until they developed Super-VHS that the quality</i><br>
<i>&gt; was compatible.</i><br>
<p>
Next to VHS, broadcast TV looked like someone drawing with crayons.  In fact, <br>
I routinely recorded movies on VHS at 1/3 speed (three two-hour movies on a <br>
tape) and couldn't tell the difference between VHS and cable.<br>
<p>
Now if you can't tell the difference between VHS at its worst and broadcast at <br>
its best, how much of an advantage can Beta's higher quality be?<br>
<p>
The early technical superiority of VHS over Beta typically became apparent <br>
approximately 61 minutes into the movie.  This was when the Beta tape <br>
reached its end and you had to change tapes -- missing part of the movie, if <br>
you were recording.  The VHS tape was only half gone.<br>
