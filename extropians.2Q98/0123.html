If you recalculate in terms of the fraction of the population being<br>
devastated,  then you'll find a lot more than five.  This is not really<br>
relevant, however.<br>
<p>

<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  Look, I don't make any disparaging comments about YOUR<br>
intelligence, nor do I attack your ideas simply by saying how bad I think<br>
they are.  I disagree with them with arguments, and add the *definitely*s<br>
for emphasis.<br>
<p>
So can we quit w/ the attacks on "argumentative style?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I, just one case i suppose, would not beg for strong leadership.  i really</i><br>

<p>
You know, to be perfectly honest, I don't think I would beg for strong<br>
leadership either.<br>
<p>
However, authoritarianism does tend to become popular when the economy is<br>
doing poorly (but what a horrible solution!), which almost inevitably<br>
results when governments topple; perhaps due to the immense amount of time<br>
and energy which could have gone towards producing useful goods, but<br>
instead went towards waging war.<br>
<p>
Also, without private property, you lose the price mechanism; without money<br>
to coordinate the economy, output falls even further.  The combination of<br>
these two could easily be the one-two punch authoritarianism needs to take<br>
over.<br>
<p>
Maybe nanotech would cover this...  maybe not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;i agree, but with one big condition: evenly distributed wealth as a start</i><br>
<i>&gt;point.  There are natural advantages of mass production which i don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;think would be compensated for in a free market system, or if it did, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;would take an extremely long time, and i don't really like asymptotic</i><br>
<i>&gt;solutions.</i><br>
<p>
What exactly are you referring to here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;otoh, anarcho-capitalist "societies" could also exist in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;anarcho-socialist world, and if they are more effective then they would</i><br>
<i>&gt;also thrive and multiply</i><br>
<p>
This is interesting...  Do you think they would?  If not, why not?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;that is pretty much what i'm hoping will happen with the help of nanotech.</i><br>
<p>
So we agree here.  This is a good sign...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;again, with wealth redistribution, no problem.  without it i don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's a sufficiently big step.  i admit that wealth redistribution isn't an</i><br>
<i>&gt;easy task, but again, nanotech might (hopefully) have something to say</i><br>
<i>&gt;about this.</i><br>
<p>
Not sufficiently big?  In your opinion, is it so small as to make it worse<br>
than not stepping at all, or is it, as I suggested, just one step in the<br>
right direction?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;it would definitely help, since there wouldn't be anyone powerful enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do anything of such magnitude.  And i don't think anarcho-capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;makes slaughter any harder than it is now</i><br>
<p>
I do, and we both know why we think this.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;if i remember correctly, it was i who described what i thought your PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be able to do.  again, if i remember correctly, i did not use the</i><br>
<i>&gt;word tyrannical.  i did describe a PPA which would be able to control you,</i><br>
<i>&gt;by which i meant that it could make you pay, even if you did not want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;and wouldn't let you switch to another PPA (i realise now where the</i><br>
<i>&gt;tyrannical and other assumptions come from, i'm sorry for the confusion).</i><br>
<i>&gt;now, from this scenario:  PPA is getting x units per second from you as</i><br>
<i>&gt;pay.  you want to pay y where y &lt; x.  Another PPA would be willing to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;paid y, but it would not be able to get you out of your current PPA's</i><br>
<i>&gt;control since your current PPA would be willing to spend f(x) (where f(x)</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a monotonically increasing function which refers to what a company</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinks you are worth) on protecting you while the other would only be</i><br>
<i>&gt;willing to spend f(y) toget you.  f(y) &lt; f(x), so you are stuck where you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are.  If you are willing to spend z, where z &gt; x, then, yes, you will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;taken out of your current PPA's control, and put under another PPA's</i><br>
<i>&gt;control which charges you z, but they have to make sure that they recoup</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they lost in getting you which has to be greater than f(x).  so,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unless your current controlling PPA is stupid and doesn't know how to</i><br>
<i>&gt;calculate the f function, then you'd end up spending more on your new one</i><br>
<i>&gt;than on your current one.</i><br>
<p>
You're leaving off the COSTS of such a system.  I referred to these<br>
previously, but in summary, the PPA has a cost advantage because it doesn't<br>
have to pay money to force me to stay with the PPA, whereas the state must<br>
force me from leaving.  I defined this difference in costs as the "window<br>
of freedom."  By charging only a fraction of the window of freedom less<br>
than the state, the PPA can charge less than the state, while still making<br>
it worthwhile to rescue you if necessary.  This window becomes larger as<br>
the PPAs become more powerful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;no, i don't think that the head of the australian military could, unless</i><br>
<i>&gt;it got support from the us military.  but even if he could, i think there</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be more (or at least the same) number of people who could take that</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision in an anarcho-capitalist system as in the current one.</i><br>
<p>
True, including the independent agencies who could step in to prevent this<br>
slaughter from occuring.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;i agree with everything until the last sentence.  why does a ppa have less</i><br>
<i>&gt;power than the army?  don't they fill exactly the same role?</i><br>
<p>
Because a PPA has competition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;consider the</i><br>
<i>&gt;colombian army hired to protect the oil pipes.  this is just one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;more explicit forms of it, but if you consider a government to be just a</i><br>
<i>&gt;business, then the army is constantly just a ppa.</i><br>
<p>
Except that it's monopolistic and won't let you leave, as a competitive PPA<br>
system would.<br>
