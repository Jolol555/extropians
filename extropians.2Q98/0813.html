<i>        &gt;invisible elf. </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
The claims are no stronger than those presented by the founders of those <br>
religions, none of whom were playing with a full deck.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Mystical experiences, which tend to be excluded or invalidated by        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;those who've never had them   </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Yes, that sometimes happens, but not nearly as often I as wish it did. It's <br>
one thing to be deeply moved by your own mystical experience, quite another <br>
thing to be influenced by somebody else's.  I could be wrong but at least I <br>
have some criteria for evaluating my own subjective experience and judge its<br>
significance and accuracy. I can't do  that with your mystical encounters <br>
because such things by definition can not be fully communicated, like trying <br>
to explain to a man blind from birth what the color red looks like. <br>
It's logically possible (but I wouldn't bet the farm on it) that a mystic <br>
somehow has access to information that can't  be obtained by the scientific<br>
method. It's also logically possible that the  mystic just has indigestion, <br>
we have no way of telling if he's correct or not, so there is (almost) no <br>
point in listening to him. In the unlikely event that I ever have a mystical <br>
experience I intend to keep it to myself, no point in making  a fool of <br>
myself by trying to talk about things that can not be communicated.<br>
<p>
I must admit I could be wrong about all this, I was once. At one time I <br>
thought  all mystics were fools, then I read a great book called <br>
"The Tao Is Silent" by Raymond Smullyan and it was a revelation to me,  <br>
Smullyan is a mystic and he didn't convince me, but he's certainly no fool. <br>
I still think most are however.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>          &gt;[mystical experiences] are frequently conceptualised and framed in        </i><br>
<i>          &gt;terms that take language to its very boundaries. But so too do QT         </i><br>
<i>          &gt;and much of mathematics.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
But there is an important difference, some pretty abstract mathematics are <br>
used in quantum mechanics and the mental models it asks us to form have <br>
little relation to those we're accustomed to, but the predictions it makes, <br>
even if sometimes they're only probabilities, are anything but vague; <br>
an electron makes a spot on a phosphorus screen or it does not, a photon <br>
makes it through a polarizer or it does not. It is for this reason that I <br>
prefer a brand of mysticism that's repeatable and consistent. There is a  <br>
name for that type of mysticism, it's called science. IF voodoo could  <br>
predict how variations in doll manufacture effected  performance of the curse, <br>
and if a Fundamental Theorem Of Voodoo could  determine the shape of the<br>
"needle penetration of doll versus distress of  victim"  plot, then voodoo <br>
would be as much a science as quantum mechanics.<br>
<p>
The important difference between magic and science is NOT that one deals in  <br>
chants, incantations and crystal balls and the other deals in equations,  <br>
lines of computer code and electron microscopes. The difference is that one  <br>
works and the other doesn't.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;like concepts of infinity and physical singularities, deity can be         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;teased out of our sense of the world's limits in a special way         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;utterly unlike delusions or even the indwelling `life-force' or gods         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of animist belief systems.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If I thought that was true then I'd be a very religious man, as would anybody <br>
who valued logic, but I don't think it's true.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We need to give our metaphysical foes credit for the depth and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;subtlety of their claims.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
That's exactly the problem, as hard as I try I can find no depth or subtlety  <br>
in religious ideas. They take everything that is unexplained  and mysterious, <br>
rap it up in a big package, paste a label on it called "God", and  then  <br>
refuse to pursue the matter any further because they insist the problem is <br>
solved. If their God would be asking himself the same deep questions that we <br>
do (and he would be, like "why have I always existed, why haven't I always  <br>
not existed?") then the problem have not been solved, just kicked upstairs.<br>
