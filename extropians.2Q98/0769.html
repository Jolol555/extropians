On pp.395-396 of the 17Apr98 Science, John Wilmoth has a thoughtful<br>
article, "The Future of Human Longevity: A Demographer's Perspective".<br>
<p>
  "The extrapolative approach to prediction is particularly compelling in <br>
the case of human mortality. ... Preductions of future life expenctancy <br>
by extrapolation yield values that are not too different from what is <br>
observed today. ... An independent study, based on a purely extrapolative <br>
technique, yielded more optimistic results (U.S. life expectancy at birth <br>
in 2050 of 84.3 years for both sexes combined) ...  Although short-term <br>
fluctuations have been common, long-term mortality trends have been <br>
remarkably stable. ...  Quite simply, a projection based on less that 20 <br>
years of experience that extends 50 to 100 years into the future is <br>
imprudent, if not foolhardy. ... <br>
   In recent years, the extrapolative approach to mortality prediction <br>
has been challenged by assertions that future changes in average human <br>
life-span may come more or less quickly than in the past.  The more <br>
optimistic view that life-span partly will increase rapidly in the near <br>
future is the result of the acceration in rates of mortality decline <br>
among the elderly in developed countries during the past few decades (5).  <br>
But from a historical perspective, this change is recent and should be <br>
extrapolated into the future with caution.  If the new pattern persists <br>
for several more decades, it will then constitute strong evidence that <br>
the old trends have been replaced by new ones.  <br>
   Another source of optimisim about future mortality rates likes in the <br>
potential application of existing technology (for example, nutritional <br>
supplememtns and reductions in smoking) or the unusual longevity of <br>
certain groups (such as Mormons and Seventh Day Adventists) (6). Such <br>
discussions may be a god way to improve health behaviors, but they are <br>
not so good at informing predictions, largely because this same srot of <br>
advocacy influenced past trends as well.  For purposes of prediction, <br>
we need to ask whether future positive reforms in life-style are likely <br>
to be implemented faster of more effectively than were similar reforms <br>
in the past.<br>
   From time to time, technological breakthroughs provide another source <br>
of optimism about future mortality rates.  Recently, the manipulation <br>
of a gene that halts the shortening of telomeres during the replication <br>
of human cells in vitro was a source of great optimism in the popular <br>
media, provoking rather extraordinary claims about the possibility of <br>
surviving to unprecedented ages in the near future (7).  Talk of cures for <br>
cancer and vaccines against AIDS promotes similar hopes.  Such discussions <br>
should not be dismissed as mere wishful thinking but should also be seen <br>
in historical perspective.<br>
   As wonderous as they may be, recent scientific advances should be <br>
compared, for example, to Koch's isolation of the tubercle bacillus in <br>
1882 - which provided confirmation of the germ theory of disease and led to <br>
a great flourishing of public health initiatives around the turn of the <br>
century - or to Fleming's discovery of the antibacterial properties of <br>
penicillin in 1928, an event that led to the anibiotic drug therapies <br>
introduced in the 1940s.  Extrapolations of past mortality trends assume, <br>
implicitly, a continuation of social and technological advance on a part <br>
with the earlier achievements."<br>
