______Year 2000 Efforts: Big Problem, Slow Going_______<br>
<p>
Two surveys released yesterday give mixed reviews to <br>
worldwide year 2000 efforts. The results of Cap Gemini's <br>
ongoing year 2000 survey of 128 companies show corporate <br>
America finally facing the magnitude of the year 2000 <br>
problem. But Gartner Group's year 2000 survey reveals that a <br>
sizable number of users and vendors are not taking the year <br>
2000 problem as seriously as they should.<br>
<p>
Since Cap Gemini's last survey, released in December, the <br>
number of companies with full-fledged year 2000 strategies <br>
jumped from 20% to 60%, according to the most recent survey. <br>
The majority of the IT managers polled said they grossly <br>
underestimated their year 2000 budgets; some said year 2000 <br>
spending will exceed $100 million. Also, 20% of the managers <br>
said their companies have deferred new IT development to re-<br>
allocate resources for year 2000 work.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, one-quarter of the 6,000 companies and <br>
government agencies surveyed worldwide by Gartner Group have <br>
yet to start any year 2000 compliance efforts, according to <br>
survey results released yesterday at the Gartner Group <br>
Predicts conference in San Diego. Even more startling: Half <br>
of all survey respondents have no plans to test their year <br>
2000 efforts after they've completed them.<br>
<p>
Lou Marcoccio, a Gartner Group analyst, cited about 200 <br>
legal disputes involving year 2000 issues. He said 93% of <br>
those disputes involve end users complaining that vendors <br>
are not adhering to contracts and are going back on earlier <br>
promises to provide free year 2000 fixes. A year ago, <br>
Marcoccio adds, only 1% of all vendors charged for year 2000 <br>
fixes; today, 29% charge. The legal actions are not reaching <br>
the courts, but are being settled privately, according to <br>
Marcoccio, who says that two settlements were recently <br>
reached, one for $8.5 million, another for $2.2 million, <br>
both in favor of the end users.--Hakhi Alakhun El and Bruce Caldwell<br>
