<i>&gt; of matter and energy that drifts by it, to suck in the whole universe if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; could maneuver it into the black hole's vicinity.</i><br>
<p>
Huh? I don't see any problem at all here. Of course, I'm deep down a<br>
mathematician, so I might have lost my common sense long ago. Remember<br>
that even an evaporating black hole is still absorbing energy that<br>
happens to get to close to the horizon. There is nothing qualitatively<br>
different between a hole just below the background radiation level or<br>
just above, both absorb and radiate about the same amount of energy<br>
with the only difference that the difference between them changes sign<br>
at a certain outside temperature. It is an unstable fixed point, no<br>
more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The surface of the event horizon in such a scenario seems to me to be quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex.  Aside from tidal forces of rotation, which breaks the spherical</i><br>
<i>&gt; geometry of the surface and creates complex mixing patterns, there should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be peaks and valleys at the surface due to the underlying distribution of</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter inside the black hole and due to quantum fluctuations.</i><br>
<p>
The rotation doesn't seem to cause complex mixing in the models I have<br>
seen (although chaotic orbits exist), it just tends to smear out<br>
everything latitudally. The underlying distribution of matter inside<br>
don't have any effect on the horizon shape if the no hair theorems<br>
hold (it seems reasonable, since a horizon almost by definition means<br>
no information can get out of it). However, when non-symmetric matter<br>
drops into the hole there will indeed be quite a bit of wobble,<br>
numerical simulations suggest that the horizon behaves like a drop of<br>
liquid mercury as it gradually settles down by radiating away the<br>
anisotropy as gravity waves. Quantum effects might create more fuzz, I<br>
noticed some discussions among theoretical physicists about "crewcut<br>
black holes", which might have some "hair" (somebody even mentioned<br>
"hippie black holes"). But overall, macroscopic black holes likely<br>
have rather smooth horizons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Evaporation would occur at the peaks from the tangential shear from</i><br>
<i>&gt; incoming particles and accretion would occur in the valleys.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting. I guess the evaporation might be anisotropic for a<br>
excited black hole, further complicated by that the peaks and valleys<br>
are radiating away themselves as gravity waves. I wonder if one could<br>
get destabilizing effects by anisotropic evaporation that makes the<br>
peaks accelerate or grow? Sounds like a wonderfully hard problem in<br>
numerical black hole thermodynamics (if true, then black holes would<br>
likely destabilize and radiate away very quickly and we would see<br>
super-supernovas with total conversion of the black hole as the finale<br>
of a stellar death. Gamma ray bursters, anyone? :-)<br>
