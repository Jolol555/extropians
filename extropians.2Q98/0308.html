<p>
While I can't answer the point about the Plank moment, I can answer your<br>
point about the time difference being "a function of the measuring<br>
mechanism itself."  While this may actually be the case, this is NOT what<br>
is happening if you presume that light in a vacuum travels at the same<br>
speed in all reference frames.  Here's why.<br>
<p>
Suppose you have two observers, Alice and Bob.  Alice is on a train, moving<br>
horizontally relative to Bob, at a speed v.  Now suppose Alice has a simple<br>
mirror attached to the ceiling of the train and a lightbulb on the floor,<br>
which she uses to measure the time it takes light to travel from the floor<br>
to the ceiling and back.  If we define the distance D to be the distance<br>
between the ceiling and the floor, she should measure that<br>
<p>
	t_a = 2D/c.  (1)<br>
<p>
where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.  (See Figure 1.)<br>
<p>
      Figure 1 	             Figure 2<br>
<p>
        ---                      ---<br>
         ^|                      /|\<br>
<i>         || D                   / | \</i><br>
<i>         ||                    / D|  \L</i><br>

                                v*t_b<br>
<p>
<p>
However, Bob will see something VERY different.  He will also see the light<br>
leave the lightbulb, hit the mirror and strike the lightbulb again, but in<br>
his reference frame the lightbulb has moved a distance v*t_b (where v,<br>
again, is the speed at which Alice is moving relative to Bob, and t_b is<br>
the time the light travels in Bob's reference frame).  So he sees the light<br>
travelling twice the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed<br>
by v*t_b/2 and D, whose length is given by the Pythagorean Theorem to be:<br>
<p>
L^2 = D^2 + (v*t_b/2)^2.  (2)<br>
<p>
(See Figure 2.)<br>
<p>
It is worth now pointing out that if it were simply a ball bouncing up and<br>
down in this train, Bob would observe t_b=t_a, since Alice and Bob are not<br>
moving vertically to one another.  Thus he would observe the speed of the<br>
ball to be c_b=L/t_a, and Alice would observe c_a=D/t_a.  This is the form<br>
of relativity we're used to; just as one runner appears motionless to the<br>
runner next to him travelling at the same velocity, or how trees appear to<br>
be moving relative to you when you drive past them in a car.  We naturally<br>
observe different speeds as our speeds change.<br>
<p>
However, when we presume the speed of light to be constant, something<br>
entirely different happens.  In this case, Bob must observe<br>
<p>
t_b = 2L/c (3)<br>
<p>
where c is *the same c observed by Alice*.  Solving for D in equation (1),<br>
we get<br>
<p>
D = c*t_a/2 (4)<br>
<p>
which we can substitute in equation (2):<br>
<p>
L^2 = (c*t_a/2)^2 + (v*t_b/2)^2. (5)<br>
<p>
Now if we solve equation (3) for L^2<br>
<p>
L^2 = (c*t_b/2)^2 (6)<br>
<p>
and eliminate L^2, we get<br>
<p>
(c*t_b/2)^2 = (c*t_a/2)^2 + (v*t_b/2)^2 (7).<br>
<p>
To solve this equation for t_b, we can multiply both sides by 4 = (1/2)^2<br>
<p>
(c*t_b)^2 = (c*t_a)^2 + (v*t_b)^2 (8),<br>
<p>
subract (v*t_b)^2 from both sides and factor t_b from the left,<br>
<p>
(c*t_b)^2 - (v*t_b)^2 = (c*t_a)^2 = t_b^2*(c^2 - v^2)<br>
<p>
then divide both sides by (c^2 - v^2) and divide the numerator and<br>
denominator by c^2<br>
<p>
t_b^2 = (c*t_a)^2/(c^2 - v^2) = t_a^2/(1-v^2/c^2)<br>
<p>
and finally take the square root of both sides:<br>
<p>
t_b = t_a/(1-v^2/c^2)^0.5<br>
<p>
What does all this mean?  Well, suppose v = 0.6c, or 60% the speed of<br>
light, and t_a = 10 seconds.  Plugging into the equation above, we get t_b<br>
= 12.5 seconds, where we SHOULD have gotten t_b = 10 seconds if c_a != c_b.<br>
<p>
At this point, you should be saying to yourself "OK, nice math.  But does<br>
it actually apply to reality?  That is, IS c the same in all reference<br>
frames?"<br>
<p>
Which is, of course, the job of scientists to determine.  And fortunately<br>
for us incoherent relativists [ ;) ], they have given us plenty of evidence<br>
that this theory is precisely correct.  For example, according to this<br>
theory, the speed of an object approaches c as the kinetic energy<br>
approaches infinity, contrary to what Newton's laws would have told you.<br>
And sure enough, in 1964, W. Bertozzi accelerated electrons to various<br>
measured speeds and measured their kinetic energy using a different method.<br>
 As we all had expected, their kinetic energy did increase, but their speed<br>
did not.<br>
<p>
Not conclusive enough for you?  Well, it has also been observed that muons,<br>
which have an average lifetime of 2.200 microseconds, have an average<br>
lifetime of 63.5 microseconds when moving at 0.9994c relating to the<br>
laboratory; precisely the value predicted by special relativity.<br>
<p>
Still not conclusive enough?  Physicists at the University of Maryland<br>
performed an experiment which involved taking a high-precision clock and<br>
flying it around Chesapeake Bay at extremely high velocities; they verified<br>
the time dilation predicted by this experiment to better than 1%.<br>
<p>
I must admit that at first, while I was immediately convinced that IF we<br>
presume that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, time<br>
must dilate in the manner prescribed here.  However, it took a great deal<br>
of experimental evidence before I was convinced that this was actually the<br>
case.  Check it out for yourself.  I got most of the information here from<br>
_Fundamentals of Physics, 5th Edition_ by Halliday, Resnick and Walker.<br>
(Further reference upon request.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I agree that the speed of light being the same for any observer is</i><br>
<i>&gt;absolute, an absolute metaphysical assumption.  Verification continues... </i><br>
<p>
Verification is complete.  It is not metaphysical, it is repeatable and<br>
observable to within 1%.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is science, not mysticism.  I have not rejected QM, I have simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;noted that QM and Relativity are not reconciled, and they are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;reconciled for a reason that science has not discovered yet.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps not, but the reason we accept both is because both theories predict<br>
the behavior of the world around us to as close as we can measure.  One day<br>
we may find the true model, but until then we accept these models because<br>
they work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They have not</i><br>
<i>&gt;discovered it yet because something is wrong with some of the metaphysical</i><br>
<i>&gt;assumptions underlying the current Kuhnian paradigm and it is very hard to</i><br>
<i>&gt;buck dogmatism when you are trying to suck in grant money.</i><br>
<p>
However, I take offense at charges of dogmatism.  People only confuse<br>
science and religion until they actually start taking a look at the very<br>
real repeatable experiments which have been performed throughout this<br>
century.  Mysticism and dogmatism can never provide such evidence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also can't believe that individuals who proclaim themselves to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientists, promote the Big Bang as science.  Creation ex nihilo was</i><br>
<i>&gt;formulated as a pious scientific doctrine at the Fourth Lateran Council in</i><br>
<i>&gt;1215.  All the kooky machinations undergone since then to undergird this</i><br>
<i>&gt;doctrine resemble Ptolemy's increasingly convoluted epicycles more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything else.</i><br>
<p>
Uhm...  Kooky, huh?  Care to explain that in a fashion which doesn't<br>
contradict experimental evidence?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a lot of kookiness in science I don't go for.  Time travel, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;one.  Utterly senseless.</i><br>
<p>
Good for you!  I don't believe much of that garbage either.  There hasn't<br>
been any conclusive repeatable evidence, after all.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Basement or attic universes for another, unless</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Planck moment for each is different from ours and different from each</i><br>
<i>&gt;other, then I'd be willing to entertain the idea.</i><br>
<p>
That's fine.  Many accomplished scientists, who agree with special/general<br>
relativity and accept QM reject the idea of basement universes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Singularities inside</i><br>
<i>&gt;black holes for another.  Black holes are just like glaciers, if you want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to free up the matter in them, just raise the background temperature around</i><br>
<i>&gt;them.</i><br>
<p>
This, however, is not true.  Remember that absolute speed of light<br>
constant, presumed above?  Well, as Bertozzi showed, increasing the kinetic<br>
energy STILL doesn't increase the speed faster than c; and since it<br>
doesn't, you STILL can't extract matter from a black hole, no matter how<br>
hot it gets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The idea of a space-time continuum for another, I'd go for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;space-time conjunction or a space continuum, though.</i><br>
<p>
Depends on what you mean by continuum, and what effects you claim this has<br>
on physical objects.  As empirically observed above, velocity DOES affect<br>
the way time flows, but a lot of people use the space-time continuum to<br>
explain all kinds of kooky things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Planck moment is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not a variable, not involved in any continuum, at least not locally anyway.</i><br>
<p>
This is an interesting one which I haven't heard talked about much.  Does<br>
the Plank moment dilate along with the rest of time?  Does anybody here<br>
know much about this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't just pick on junk physics either, biology makes no sense when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;takes randomness (as in mutations) to be some ontological aspect, rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;than an epistemological aspect.  If there was one ounce of ontological</i><br>
<i>&gt;randomness in the universe, the universe would be entirely unintelligible.</i><br>
<p>
Now you've gone and challenged all of QM, which has more experimental<br>
evidence behind it than I can shake a stick at.  What's with that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Lastly, I can't think of any greater credibility problem that to take</i><br>
<i>&gt;information as an ontological primitive.</i><br>
<p>
This sentance doesn't make any sense to me, even after I looked up the noun<br>
"primitive" for double meanings.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Information has no existence without a knower and a known.</i><br>
<p>
Statistical thermodynamics, too?  What's up, guy?  <br>
<p>
Information is a signal which reduces uncertainty.<br>
Pop quiz:  Is there information in a closed book?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is a common fallacy to say that DNA</i><br>
<i>&gt;transmits information, without referencing the knower who can translate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information.</i><br>
<p>
It is a similarly common fallacy to say that there can be information in a<br>
book which has not been read.  Oh, wait, THAT's not a fallacy...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;DNA replication, the thing-in-itself, is not transmitting</i><br>
<i>&gt;information, it is simply molecules bumping around and lining up in</i><br>
<i>&gt;preferred developmental branches.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, and all those letters are just little splotches of ink.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The "everything is digital" worldview I</i><br>
<i>&gt;always held to be harmless idiocy until I was shown that it leads to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mandate to guillotine half my state.  I will take it seriously now.</i><br>
<p>
And as to your thoughts on abortion, I have this to say:<br>
<p>
Your position is not empirical until you prove that the fetus is living<br>
organism which can be killed.  (The finger, for example, cannot be<br>
"killed," even though the cells in the finger can die.)  Most, if not all<br>
people who support abortion do NOT think that the fetus can be killed.<br>
<p>
I concede that you do have a concrete definition of what's living and<br>
what's not, and within this context, you are 100% correct.  However, this<br>
is not a sufficient proof.  I could just as easily say that a person cannot<br>
be killed until they are born.<br>
<p>
So here's a quick course on logic for you:<br>
<p>
You cannot prove an assertion by defining your assertion to be true.  To<br>
provide a logical argument, use COMMON definitions.  If two parties do not<br>
use definitions, you must use other common definitions to show why the<br>
other definitions are wrong.  But anyway you run it, we have to use<br>
premises upon which everyone agrees in order to have a logical discussion.<br>
<p>
I challenge you to prove, using definitions and premises upon which we both<br>
agree, that abortion is immoral; if you can't or won't, then don't try to<br>
have a logical argument with me.<br>
<p>
Have fun!<br>
