Subject: Rothbard on Ethics<br>
Sender: owner-misesmail@colossus.net<br>
<p>
At last, _The Ethics of Liberty_ by Murray N. Rothbard is again<br>
available. This treatise, first published in 1982 in defense of <br>
natural rights and private property, is Rothbard's most extended <br>
treatment of the subject, but it has been out-of-print since<br>
1984. <br>
<p>
This new edition, from New York University Press, features an <br>
extended analysis of Rothbard's contribution to political economy <br>
by his student and colleague Hans-Hermann Hoppe, a new bibliography,and a<br>
new index. Hoppe compares Rothbard's theory <br>
of the pure private property society with John Rawls's defense of <br>
redistribution and Robert Nozick's early advocacy of the minimal state. <br>
<p>
Rothbard covers the theory of rights as well as applications to <br>
criminal justice, the market for protection, family law, boycotts, <br>
animal "rights," lifeboat situations, land monopolies, relations <br>
between states, immigration, and free speech. He discusses <br>
utilitarian economics, the unanimity principle, "negative liberty," <br>
Hayek on coercion, and the Nozickian state. Finally, Rothbard delves <br>
into the intellectual and political strategy for achieving liberty. <br>
<p>
The book, an uncompromising philosophical defense of the foundation <br>
of a free society, is 308+xlix pp. and beautifully hardbound. It<br>
is available for $28 (postpaid in the U.S.) from the Mises <br>
Institute, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849. Inquire about <br>
foreign postage. Phone 334-844-2500; fax 334-844-2583; credit card <br>
orders can be sent to mises@mises.org<br>
<p>
Says NYU Press: <br>
<p>
"What distinguishes Rothbard's book is the manner in which it roots<br>
the case for freedom in the concept of natural rights and applies it<br>
to a host of practical problems. An economist by profession,<br>
Rothbard here proves himself equally at home with philosophy. And<br>
while his conclusions are radical--that a social order that strictly<br>
adheres to the rights of private property must exclude the<br>
institutionalized violence inherent in the state--his applications<br>
of libertarian principles prove surprisingly practical for a host of<br>
social dilemmas, solutions to which have eluded alternative<br>
traditions."<br>
