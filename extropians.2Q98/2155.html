It seems that the health-supplement banners<br>
going for a quick ban. Here's a clip from a <br>
message from John Hammell &lt;jham@iahf.com&gt; <br>
of International Advocates for Health <br>
Freedom (<a href="http://www.iahf.com">http://www.iahf.com</a>):<br>

<p>
Supplement Consumers World Wide: PLEASE pay VERY close attention to the US<br>
FDA's BAN on Cholestin, a dietary supplement derived from Chinese red rice<br>
yeast which effectively lowers cholesterol. <br>
<p>
Cholestin is manufactured by a company called Pharmanex. Pharmaceutical<br>
Giant MERCK has lobbied the FDA arguing that the product is a "drug"<br>
because it contains a naturally occurring substance that is similar to, but<br>
distinct from the drug lovastatin (which is marketed by Merck as<br>
"Mevacor.") (In addition to the substance which is similar to lovastatin,<br>
the red rice yeast also contains nine other active ingredients which<br>
undoubtedly make it synergistically much SAFER than Mevacor.) <br>
<p>
Long time foe of the dietary supplement industry Bruce Silverglade of so<br>
called "Center for Science in the Public Interest" (an inside the beltway<br>
shill group for pharmaceutical interests) was quoted in the May 21st<br>
Washington Post as saying "What this case stands for is the proposition<br>
that just because a substance occurs naturally in the food supply doesn't<br>
necessarily make it a dietary supplement." "The distinction is important"<br>
says Silverglade. "Products like lovastatin treat dangerous conditions that<br>
should be monitored by medical professionals" says Silverglade.<br>
<p>
(When Silverglade makes THIS kind of statement, we had BETTER be ON GUARD!<br>
This guy has a LONG history of attacking dietary supplements as a stooge<br>
for the FDA, and he is ALWAYS widely quoted by the mass media. I've been<br>
battling Silverglade and so called "Center for Science in the Public<br>
Interest" since 1989, and have always thought they had a particularly<br>
Orwellian name.)<br>
<p>
Bill McGlashon, president of Pharmanex told the Washington Times that the<br>
FDA is doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry, and in particular<br>
lovastatin maker Merck, which has been asking the FDA to take action. "The<br>
reason this whole thing began is because of Merck. Its REAL CLEAR what <br>
this is about," McGlashan said.<br>
