<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;First, some of the entities might suffer a gradual decline (like </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;humans with Alzheimer's disease), would it be nice to save backup </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;copies of their final, degraded state or should one save copies </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from an earlier state? If so, why just one, why not several? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When the creator has enough power to simulate a universe, he most </i><br>
<i>&gt; also have enough power to merge the backup copies of earlier states </i><br>
<i>&gt; with the later backups of the degraded states, and to construct </i><br>
<i>&gt; from those multiple states a "healthy" state, containing all memories </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the being. Of course one has to define what a "healthy" state is </i><br>
<i>&gt; first.</i><br>
<p>
One also has to contend with the fact that a certain individual in <br>
this "healthy" state will simultaneously remember:<br>
<p>
  * the semi-trailer truck bearing down on him as he lays helpless;<br>
<p>
  * the radio announcer talking about the incoming nuclear missiles;<br>
<p>
  * the stupid stunt he pulled as a college student, involving the <br>
ROTC building and a bit of explosive that went off much too soon;<br>
 <br>
  * the college roommate that he talked out of blowing up the ROTC <br>
building; <br>
<p>
  * the pain of a fatal childhood illness;<br>
<p>
  * many years of happy marriage;<br>
<p>
  * and several other interesting, mutually contradictory life <br>
experiences.<br>
<p>
If you would describe someone trying to reconcile all these different <br>
memories -- all of which are true -- as "healthy", then you have a <br>
much different definition of that term than I do.<br>
