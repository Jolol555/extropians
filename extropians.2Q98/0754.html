I agree with you Anders, but I think that most diplomats are only<br>
_capable_ of being <br>
"diplomatic" with other humans.  If diplomats were really good, would<br>
we not, as a species, have avoided many wars if the diplomats had<br>
really been good at their purported jobs?<br>
<p>

establish <br>

considered be <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; expendable, enslavable, etc. This would mean sending sending the</i><br>
best <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; diplomat available.  A diplomat would be able to quickly and fully </i><br>

situation the <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; human race is about to step into.  The potential to adapt</i><br>
politically to <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the situation would require a certain amount of moral and ethical </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "flexibility" that is the forte of diplomats not scientists.</i><br>
<p>
On that note related to James' post....I do not believe that trying to<br>
establish a friendly relationship would necessarily be the most<br>
prudent course of action.  I do not contend that we should be hostile<br>
with every alien species that we might encounter.  However, by what<br>
rationale would aliens have the same goals that humans do?  Once<br>
humans can figure out that wars and other destructive means of<br>
expression are extremely counterproductive, then I hope that we as<br>
humans will gain a sense of species consciousness or at least a<br>
consensus about developments that should be avoided or encouraged.  <br>
<p>
I think that another course of action prior to full scale contact with<br>
other species would be to make our planet and our species appear to be<br>
strong.  I do not believe that humans should use aggression, but that<br>
we should be able to show any other potentially hostile<br>
extraterrestrial race that bothering earth for reasons other than<br>
peaceful contact will be extremely dangerous.  Another possibility is<br>
to show other species that earth is not worth their time.  Of course,<br>
since we have only our context as a reference all of this is<br>
completely random speculations.  Any thoughts?<br>
<p>
Although authors like Sagan think that a spacefaring species would<br>
most likely be friendly, I do not think that will be/is always the<br>
case.  Is there not the possibility that extremely hostile races would<br>
not destroy themselves?  Instead they might have a sense that they are<br>
supreme and all other species should be subject to them or simply<br>
annihilated?  <br>
