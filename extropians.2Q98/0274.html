<p>
IN this case, I would suggest that we differentiate 'happiness' from<br>
'satisfaction', or merely as a subset of it.  One can be both depressed and<br>
satisfied (if thats what makes you happy). Depression is a clinical condition,<br>
not a state of happiness.  While people that are at least marginally happy seem<br>
to be the most motivated to want MORE happiness (which is why IMHO a free market<br>
system tends to outperform socialist systems economically, because people who<br>
acheive even a marginal level of satisfaction or happiness typcially decide that<br>
they want more of it, and work to get it, while a socialist system, as far as I<br>
can tell, assumes that everyone has  identical and fixed maximum happiness and<br>
satisfaction levels, that cannot be changed, and anything greater than those<br>
politically correct levels is nothing but greedy hedonism and sloth.)  people who<br>
are totally blissful and satisfied without cost tend to be even less motivated<br>
than a severely depressed mental patient.<br>
<p>
In a free market system, each individual is free to determine their own levels of<br>
marginal utility for a given product, service, etc.  and the price per unit of<br>
happiness or satisfaction the individual derives from a given product or service,<br>
not only the first unit, but each successive unit as a curve of diminishing<br>
returns. A free market system does not automatically assume that everybody has<br>
identical curves of diminishing returns for every product and service, as a<br>
socialist system does, nor does anything but the individual try to dictate to the<br>
individual what that curve may be for them.<br>
<p>
A mercantilist type system, as we currently have, more or less, here in the US,<br>
does recognise that people have different curves of diminishing returns, but they<br>
also try to influence and manipulate those curves via tax policies, regulations,<br>
and marketing/advertising violating the individuals privacy.  While this is less<br>
onerous and tyrranical than a socialist system, it does have its own limitations<br>
that I find distasteful.<br>

<i>&gt; Of course, I *know* I'm unrepresentative of humanity, so... ;-)</i><br>
<p>
As Mr. den Otter has previously said is such a rude manner, I am rather extreme<br>
myself, although I personally take pride in that, since being average is to me as<br>
good as being dead.  However, I hope here I have accurately described conditions<br>
for most people...<br>
