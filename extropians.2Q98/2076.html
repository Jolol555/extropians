<p>
Heh.  Shades of a dogma here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you meant it in the more </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; restricted sense of with respect to this issue, then you are wrong by </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; many orders af magnitude. Based upon the best information known to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them (which is usually very poor), the rational opinion for most people </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to have on this subject is either "I don't know whether immortality would </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be a good thing", or "I'd like it, but I don't think it's very likely". </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So the rational reaction would be to investigate the possibilities (like</i><br>
<i>&gt; we did), instead of staying passive and ignorant.</i><br>
<p>
And what if you can't read, don't have time to read, don't have access to <br>
a wide variety of information sources? Like most of the world's population.<br>
<p>
What if you do satisfy the above, but don't have the technical background <br>
to delve into the research literature on aging. Whose opinions should one <br>
trust? On what basis? See also below; advocates of one point of view are <br>
not usually terribly reliable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; These are both opinions which I've heard expressed or implied quite often </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by a wide variety of people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So have I, but their fault is not their initial ignorance, but their refusal to</i><br>
<i>&gt; listen to sound arguments (let alone to do some research). Even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you present the facts in the most clear, user friendly, completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; pre-chewed form they still won't listen. That is IMHO stupid.</i><br>
<p>
Oh. I haven't had that problem with people I've discussed this with, who <br>
are, admittedly, mostly scientists. In the case of scientist, a more usual <br>
response is to respond with an analysis of the entire situation with <br>
respect to aging research, which usually concludes with cautious <br>
optimism. I've found that the Hayflick Limit and the telomere cap <br>
shortening, at least, seem to be very well known.<br>
  <br>
In conversations with non-scientists, I've found that many are willing to <br>
take the possibility of preventing aging quite seriously. Present a <br>
_balanced_ account of research to any person, and they  will start to give <br>
serious thought to the possibility. The essential  point is that if your <br>
views ought to be taken seriously, then there is little need for the biased <br>
and sometimes overblown claims so common on these lists.<br>
<p>
Try to present both the pluses and the minuses of the <br>
research. I try never to trust an advocate, unless they've shown <br>
themselves to be thoroughly familiar with the problems of what they're <br>
advocating. Indeed, I would go so far as to applaud somebody who remained <br>
a sceptic about aging research after being bombarded with the usual <br>
trashumanist spiel about aging; only if that spiel were balanced by an <br>
account of the difficulties faced in aging research would I regard it as <br>
rational for them to respond with enthusiasm.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, this is one aspect of Anders Sandberg's web site which I <br>
like very much -- what appears to be an attempt to balance the discussion <br>
somewhat. Even more links to discussions of the problems with nanotech <br>
etcetera would be appreciated -- provided such links exist! <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; [1] It is quite possible to construct a value system which implies </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that immortality is a bad idea. If Hayflick's value system is of this </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; type, then his conclusion is quite rational, although his stated </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reasoning is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A consistent stupidity is still a stupidity. </i><br>
<p>
In this instance, I'd simply conclude that a meeting of minds was not <br>
possible, due to differences in basic assumptions, and leave it at that. <br>
Provided such people don't try to interfere with my goals, there is no <br>
reason to abuse their value system.<br>
