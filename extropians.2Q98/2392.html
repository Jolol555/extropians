<i>&gt;  I am not one for defending Christianity, but my reading of the New</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Testament seems to indicate that Jesus kept denying his divinity and kept</i><br>
<i>&gt;  telling his followers to stop treating him any differently than any other</i><br>
<i>&gt;  human.  I believe that his followers are the ones who diefied him, as with</i><br>
<i>&gt;  many great men.  The legend took on a life of its own, and has little</i><br>

<p>
Interesting thought.<br>
<p>
<p>
Also remember tht during the life of christ the little backwoods sect didn't<br>
do too well.  It was onlyafter that City Slicker...Saul of Taursus...on his<br>
way to persecute some Christians....fell off his donkey....had his donkey<br>
"talk" to him...experienced "revalation"...and began to promote the group he<br>
previously persecuted.........<br>
<p>
.....did the little sect really take off.  Christ was long gone by then.<br>
