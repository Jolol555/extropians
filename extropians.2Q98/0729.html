<i>&gt;That is, atheists disbelieve in gods; agnostics do not believe in gods.</i><br>

<p>
My personal definition of agnosticism is that I feel (not 'believe') that<br>
there is some force behind the Universe, but that this force has not made<br>
itself personally known to me. None of the religions I have seen make sense<br>
to me, so I am still looking for some evidence to suit me. This search does<br>
not occupy very much of my time at present.<br>
