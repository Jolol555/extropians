There was an interesting documentary on TV a couple of years ago about a<br>
group of scientists who were given the old US Navy underwater listening<br>
network for a few months before it was shut down. Amongst other things <br>
they used it to track and listen to whales around the world, and one of <br>
the tentative conclusions they reached was that the 'songs' were long-range <br>
sonar for navigation in the deep ocean; because of the inversion layer <br>
they could potentially image the entire ocean and the differing 'songs' <br>
allowed them to distinguish their returns from other whales. Wish I'd <br>
taped it, but I didn't realise how interesting it would be until afterwards.<br>
<p>
Personally I find the idea of animals who can 'see' an entire ocean far<br>
more impressive than the idea of animals singing to each other, but I<br>
guess it takes all sorts...<br>
