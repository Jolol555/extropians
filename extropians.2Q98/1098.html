Good point.  This distinction is much clearer.  Doesn't really affect any<br>
of the relevant points, but it IS much clearer.<br>
<p>

<p>
By this you seem to be implying that very smart robots WOULDN'T grant us<br>
rights, and so, in order to protect our rights, we shouldn't try to build<br>
them too smart.<br>
<p>
It's true, smart robots might decide to rob us of our rights.  I'd like to<br>
think that they wouldn't, but that's really just a guess.  However, since<br>
we can only guess at this sort of thing, the underlying premise behind an<br>
argument like this is that we shouldn't try to create new entities smarter<br>
than ourselves, including trans/posthuman children, if there's a chance<br>
that doing so will jeopardize our liberties.<br>
<p>
If germline engineering turns out to be a good way to build a better<br>
human, and that happens to mean that our children will be superior to us<br>
in every way, does that mean we shouldn't have smarter children?  After<br>
all, it would be a moot question to ask whether we should grant THEM<br>
rights...  the question would be whether they would grant rights to us. <br>
