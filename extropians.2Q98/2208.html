<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;   'c' in a full vacuum.  In the ballistic theory, the photons are emitted</i><br>

<i>&gt;   to the atoms in the medium.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    The 'gravitational slowing' you discuss is explained  by the ballistic theory of</i><br>
<i>&gt; light in the ordinary classical-mechanical  way.  SR/GR have to assert that</i><br>
<i>&gt; dimensionality is affected by gravity,  so that the photons are still travelling at</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'c' but (somehow) space and  time are altered so this means they don't get very far.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have never  seen a good explanation of this -- alleged -- process.</i><br>
<p>
Easy. Since a solid substance has its atoms tightly packed, the gravity field exerted by<br>
each indvidual atom is very high at a very short distance from the nucleus. As gravity<br>
field density will change c relative to an observer outside that local field density,<br>
and the gravity field density inside matter is higher than that outside matter, photons<br>
traveling through solid, or liquid matter, will be observed to slow down while<br>
traveling  inside the matter, then resuming the normal c when outside that matter, while<br>
if you were the photon, you would notice no difference between the two....<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       We start with a uniform cubic space, say one metre along each edge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       On the north side is a blue LED pointing south, and alongside it, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       photoelectric cell likewise aimed southwards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       On the south side we have a red LED pointed north, and a northwardly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       aimed photoelectric cell.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       Our apparatus is rigged so that the red and the blue LEDs fire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       simuultaneusly.  The photoelectric cells record the time of flight</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       of the red and the blue photons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       Armed with this kit, we can do a timeslice-by-timeslice analysis of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       the positions of the photons within the cube.  We can show</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       _conclusively_ that  -- for the photons to start where and when they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       do, and end up when and where they do, the red photons MUST travel</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;       at 2c relative to the blue photons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No, this is not true. They travel at the same speed, with different wavelengths.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          You completely miss the point.  The only reason to have red and</i><br>
<i>&gt;          blue photons is to colour-differentiate them for ease of</i><br>
<i>&gt;          explanation.  Northbound blue passes southbound blue at 2c.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Northbound red passes southbound red at 2c.  The situational</i><br>
<i>&gt;          logic is unbreakable.</i><br>
<p>
Understanding relativity shows that, relative to each other, northbound blue and<br>
southbound blue are temporally coexistent. Since they are both traveling at c, the<br>
northbound photon, as an observer, experiences no time passage, only a single instant,<br>
expending energy k in the instant of emission from point a and absorption at point b. To<br>
an observer that is not traveling at absolute c, each photon is traveling at c, relative<br>
to the non-c observer. Depending on the speed and direction of the observer relative to<br>
the two photons, the wavelengths of each will be compressed, extended, or unchanged.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'd like to see citations of mathematical treatments of black hole</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; theory that precedes SR/GR by 100 years. Lessee, that means they should</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be published before 1805.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Black Holes are implicit in Newtonian gravitation with a ballistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;      ('corpuscular') theory of light.  If the velocity of emission of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      light-particles is less than the escape velocity of the emitting</i><br>
<i>&gt;      body, the light-particle cannot escape the gravitational field and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      will eventually fall back.</i><br>
<p>
If this were so, then black holes would not be black, but would shine like any other<br>
star, as the quantum virtual photons traveling above c that escaped would be redshifted<br>
into the visible spectrum by the slowing of the photons escape velocity. Since black<br>
holes are in fact black, outside of event horizon impact  and zero field splitting<br>
radiation, then your theory is wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        The calculations are fairly simple.  Once we had Newton's</i><br>
<i>&gt;      gravitational theory and &lt;inter alia&gt; Roehmer's measurement of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      lightspeed by astronomical observation the calculation of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Schwartzchild radius etc. is fairly easy.  Everything's a whole lot</i><br>
<i>&gt;      simpler with ballistic theory, remember.  We've had great</i><br>
<i>&gt;      mathematical tools for centuries.</i><br>
<p>
Using ballistic theory for rough calculations does in fact work, just as Newton's Laws<br>
work for most all macroscopic phonomena as rough approximations.  However, getting down<br>
to the nitty gritty fine results takes much more, especially when dealing with angstrom<br>
distances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Solid state electronics cannot be described by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; classical mechanics, because so much of electronic theory depends on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tunneling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Funny, then, that we can model matter so accurately with classical</i><br>
<i>&gt;     mechanics (Car-Parrinello Method) that we can _calculate_ (say) the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     melting-point of silicon.  You have to get your head around the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;     that the same physical phenomena can be explained by indefinitely many</i><br>
<i>&gt;     different theories, as Leibnitz showed.  The photo-electric effect</i><br>
<i>&gt;     preceded Einstein &amp; Lenard's [1905].  Why do you think it's impossible</i><br>
<i>&gt;     to come up with an auxilliary theory (even an ad hoc theory...) to</i><br>
<i>&gt;     enable us to calculate tunnelling using classical mechanics?  All QM</i><br>
<i>&gt;     is, is a statistically-based approximation method.</i><br>
<p>
Explain via ballistic theory how an electron can jump across a PN gate without quantum<br>
tunneling, all ballistic theory can do is calculate it as a current, and assumes<br>
constant flow. It cannot explain the tunnelling.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Likewise,  lasers cannot function purely by classical mechanics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Absolutely, they can (leaving aside the loose language).  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;     mechanics of electron orbits, and of absorption and emission of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     light-particles (photons) are all in my RM paper.  You simply don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;     understand how far-reaching and powerful Classical Mechanics is as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;     system.  What is it about lasers you think we can't explain?</i><br>
<p>
they cannot explain cascading.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nor can polarizing filters on cameras.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Simple: the light-particles spin (on up to 3 orthogonal axes).</i><br>
<p>
If they spun by classical mechanics, they would have to precess, and therefore a<br>
polarizing filter would block all light.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the electroluminescent lamp cannot function by classical mechanics</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    A classical model of the atom (based on Bohr's baroque neo-classical</i><br>
<i>&gt;    [1913] model) explains photon emission perfectly well -- RM explains it</i><br>
<i>&gt;    even better.</i><br>
<p>
They cannot explain how a mere alternating electrostatic field can cause photon<br>
emission. By classical mechanics, an electroluminescent lamp is action at a distance,<br>
and should be impossible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; nuclear fission cannot be described by classical mechanics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Of course it can -- go look up 'packing fractions.'  All energy is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    kinetic or potential.  Bound particles have potential energy.  Orbiting</i><br>
<i>&gt;    particles have kinetic energy.</i><br>
<p>
And here you are wrong. Any element at or above iron absorbs more energy in fusion,<br>
while any element below iron in the periodic table absorbs more energy in fission.<br>
Classical mechanics cannot explain this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the quantum tunneling microscope cannot function by classical mechanics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Again, you're missing the point.  The effect is not dependent on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     theory.  And I asked for six examples relating to SR/GR, by the way,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     not QM.</i><br>
<p>
OK, how about this, atomic clocks traveling at different speeds need to be recalibrated<br>
every so often, due to relativistic effects that cannot be explained by classical<br>
mechanics..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ok, thats six, now where is my money?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Not-OK!  Not six!  No cigar.  See above.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Tony</i><br>
<i>&gt; PS: Sen. Pam Roach ('R', Auburn, WA) cited precisely your concealed-carry</i><br>
<i>&gt; point, BTW).  This still does not endear her to me.</i><br>

I CC:'d everyone you sent that message to with my comments. Funny, the Seattle DA on<br>
your list just dumped it and didn't even read it.<br>
