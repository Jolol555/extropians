 If they are in fact transcripts of pre-christian texts then the<br>
probabilities are that they are written in Aramaic rather than Hebrew.<br>
My suspicion is that they may be copies of excerpts from the Dead Sea<br>
Scrolls (If not they may be forgeries. There are a lot of them being<br>
produced in the middle east and sold to ignorant tourists.)<br>
If they are copies of Dead Sea Scroll excerpts then they have already<br>
been translated by numerous people -- actually mistranslated in many<br>
instances, but that's another story -- of various degrees of<br>
scholarship.<br>
You may wish to check with the Archeology department of any major<br>
University. Most have legitimate experts in this area.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, avoid so-called experts at most small christian bible<br>
colleges. Mostly, they don't know what they're talking about, but talk<br>
they do, and they never seem to stop providing massive amounts of<br>
misinformation and unsupported, unscientific opinion .<br>
