At 15:00 5/6/98 -0400, you wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;In the absence of any controls, how do you prevent a monopoly, given</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;free of government handouts and special favors, but should also be free of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;coercion and use of force..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Competition.  If you're trying to jack up the prices in a nasty way, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm offering an equivalent good at the lower price, you'll fail; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;consumers will all (freely) buy from me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The point I was trying to make is that some folks will use the point of a<br>
gun, or bombs, or intimidation, to put down competition. Any society must<br>
have methods to deal with criminals.<br>
<p>
If all players are reasonably honest, then in the free market there should<br>
not be monopolies. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Indeed, many economists believe that it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to create a</i><br>
<i>&gt;(non-natural) monopoly without government support.  Once the monopoly tries</i><br>
<i>&gt;to jack up the prices, it creates a window between the actual marginal cost</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the product and the market price, a window which competitors can make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;profit filling.  So if you're really looking at someone to blame, look to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the government, which has a history of corrupt corporate welfare.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;"good for American businesses."  Heard that one before?</i><br>
<p>
Amen. Uncle has much to answer for.<br>
<p>
I have a side question - what about 'trade secrets'? If they are properly<br>
guarded, the widget resulting is extremely difficult to reverse engineer.. I<br>
would hope that this case is going to be rewarded by the inventor/maker<br>
getting most of the market, as the competition's goods won't be of<br>
comparable quality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can't compare information to widgets; the transmission of information</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a SERVICE, not the sales of goods.  When I give you a backrub, I do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;a service.  I have not made a "backrub unit" and sold it to you.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;scratched your back, and you have paid me for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I missed an initial post on this - I thought you were talking about<br>
material goods, not products.<br>
<p>
When it comes to paper, I have different feelings about patents.<br>
Unfortunately, these feelings tend to be that copyright should cover plans,<br>
software, etc, not patents. So we are still at odds, I fear..<br>
<p>
(I LOATHE the idea of software patents, and NASA is a prime offender. See<br>
any issue of NASA Tech Briefs..)<br>
(and yes, I do quite a bit of programming..)<br>
