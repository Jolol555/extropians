<i>&gt;A Study of Imagination Deficiency in Ten Cases of Skepticism</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;by David Quinne</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In 1983 Barbara &amp; Walters identified a group of skeptical people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;differed significantly from the population at large.  Their subjects,</i><br>
<i>&gt;culled from various Internet discussion groups were self-identified</i><br>
<i>&gt;``skeptics.''  These skeptics showed an interest in science and</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology, and were not shy about sharing their views.  Within this</i><br>
<i>&gt;group Barbara &amp; Walters identified a subgroup of 28 people who showed a</i><br>
<i>&gt;series of intense skepticism including rejection of traditional social</i><br>
<i>&gt;structures, references to a common set of arguments, and an inability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;bring a line of argument to an end.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These 28 were given a battery of tests to determine their ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;image, visualize, make abstractions, and socialize.  Of the 28, 27</i><br>
<i>&gt;showed a strong cluster around a set of traits.  What stood out as</i><br>
<i>&gt;unusual, was that this group of 27 really seemed to ``believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt;rationality'' above all else, and could not understand why anybody would</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagree.  For this reason, Barbara &amp; Walters dubbed the cluster</i><br>
<i>&gt;Imagination Deficient Personality (IDP)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Black &amp; Decker (1991) reviewed the Internet postings of 136 skeptics</i><br>
<i>&gt;undergoing treatment for high blood pressure.  In this group, they found</i><br>
<i>&gt;that 111 scored positive on at least one of Barbara &amp; Walter's criterion</i><br>
<i>&gt;for IDP.  They recommend that IDP should be added to the list of</i><br>
<i>&gt;criterion examined, when seeking a psychogenic cause of high blood</i><br>
<i>&gt;pressure, ulcers and other physical illnesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In 1993, Brothers divided 74 skeptical volunteers into two groups.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;first group consisted of 50 incidental skeptics (e.g., have read an SI</i><br>
<i>&gt;or argued with their mother about the evils of religion) and 24</i><br>
<i>&gt;lifestyle skeptics (e.g., written skeptical books, been on more than one</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk show or moved to Buffalo, NY).  Interestingly, Brothers found IDP</i><br>
<i>&gt;was no more common in either group than in a control group, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;lifestyle skeptics had a more intensive and vivid skeptical experience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This included a marked elevation of physiological measures including</i><br>
<i>&gt;blood pressure, voice stress and skin conductivity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In this study, the written works of ten well know skeptics are compared</i><br>
<i>&gt;to seven criterion from Barbara &amp; Walters (1883) Imagination Deficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;Personality (IDP) scale.  In eight cases the skeptics scored seven out</i><br>
<i>&gt;of seven and the remaining two skeptics scored six out of seven for</i><br>
<i>&gt;these traits.  The traits selected from Barbara &amp; Walters are:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1.  Lack of meta-awareness: Imagination Deficient people show a lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt;awareness of the motivation or value systems of others.  Often they will</i><br>
<i>&gt;make assumptions regarding ``right thinking'' which fail to take into</i><br>
<i>&gt;account the unique circumstances or social structure in which other</i><br>
<i>&gt;people live.  For example, they may argue with people about religion or</i><br>
<i>&gt;other unprovable metaphysical beliefs.  Low meta-awareness may also be</i><br>
<i>&gt;shown by disregard, or in the case of subject 7, hostility towards</i><br>
<i>&gt;minorities or disfranchised people.  Subjects 1, 8 and 9 actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;organized conferences dedicated to correcting the thinking of non-skeptics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.  Curmudgeonality: A person with IDP is often suspicious of or hostile</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards new social trends.  Note, this is not the same as complaining</i><br>
<i>&gt;about progress (95% of IDP were strongly for progress in Barbara &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Walter's study), it is instead a sense that values are slipping, or the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world is suffering from spreading disrespect, irrationality or lowered</i><br>
<i>&gt;standards.  Subjects 1, 7, 8 and 9 frequently made remarks regarding a</i><br>
<i>&gt;decline in society, all 10 subjects made at least passing reference to</i><br>
<i>&gt;spreading irrationality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3.  Transcendental Substitution: The Imagination Deficient person tends</i><br>
<i>&gt;not to participate in traditional social institutions which promote</i><br>
<i>&gt;brotherhood, tribal union or spiritual values, so many of them</i><br>
<i>&gt;substitute non-traditional institutions they find acceptable.  For</i><br>
<i>&gt;example, the IDP may take up an interest in magic, or science, or they</i><br>
<i>&gt;may join a library.  64% of Barbara &amp; Walter's IDP subjects subscribed</i><br>
<i>&gt;to three or more science magazines.  Again, all 10 subjects were</i><br>
<i>&gt;positive on this indicator, 2 going so far as to setup temple like</i><br>
<i>&gt;structures in which to meet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4.  Hyper-realistic representation: This is a tendency on the part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Imagination Deficient to expect a realistic or rational</i><br>
<i>&gt;representation in all aspects of life.  For example, the IDP may engage</i><br>
<i>&gt;in nit picking about plot lines in TV programs or books, or complain</i><br>
<i>&gt;about contemporary linguistic usage which conflicts with a technical</i><br>
<i>&gt;term.  Eight of the 10 subjects scored positive on this measure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subjects 8 and 9 wrote books substantially about correct usage of</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientific terms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;5.  Fictional miss-identification: Often an IDP will react to fictional</i><br>
<i>&gt;representations as though they are real.  For example, they may complain</i><br>
<i>&gt;about how a popular fictional TV programs portrays the paranormal, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;get irate if book they are reading invokes a ghost or spirit, or has a</i><br>
<i>&gt;character convert to a spiritual outlook.  Some write letters of</i><br>
<i>&gt;complaint to newspapers that, for example, carry an astrology column.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Once again all subjects were positive on this measure with one (Subject</i><br>
<i>&gt;5) even refusing to fly on an airline whose travel magazine included an</i><br>
<i>&gt;astrology column.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;6.  Delusions of superiority: In many cases the IDP will believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt;they have special traits or talents not shared by other people.  Usually</i><br>
<i>&gt;these are confined to a narrow range of human abilities, and tend to</i><br>
<i>&gt;center around issues of intelligence or education.  In the mildly IDP</i><br>
<i>&gt;this may simply come off as immaturity, arrogance or elitism.  Subject</i><br>
<i>&gt;3, however, consistently referred to others as "Delusional" or made</i><br>
<i>&gt;references to "Elevator[s] not going to the top floor", and subjects 7,</i><br>
<i>&gt;8 and 9 dedicated substantial time to denigrating the works of some</i><br>
<i>&gt;obscure scholars.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;7.  Mission directed outlook: The Imagination Deficient frequently</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe that they serve a higher cause, or that some necessary actions</i><br>
<i>&gt;must be taken to avoid disaster.  All Ten Subjects, for example, make</i><br>
<i>&gt;reference to a "rising tide of irrationality", and subjects 1, 3 and 5</i><br>
<i>&gt;invoke this before all public gatherings.  In extreme cases this may</i><br>
<i>&gt;involve actions that resemble attempts at conversion or missionary work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The category Imagination Deficient Personality is not offered as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mental illness, or scientifically proven personality trait.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead a category which helps to organize and understand what is</i><br>
<i>&gt;happening in cases of skepticism.  Instead of dividing skeptics into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;usual two categories of "negative nay-sayers" and "atheists", we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead see that many of them are really just imagination deficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The results of my study show high Imagination Deficiency among 10</i><br>
<i>&gt;selected skeptics.  Whether or not the same results would be obtained</i><br>
<i>&gt;with additional skeptics remains to be seen.  Nevertheless, my study</i><br>
<i>&gt;does support the earlier opinions of Barbara &amp; Walters that alleged</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational people tend to be Imagination Deficient Personalities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainly, that is the evidence from the very best skeptics as</i><br>
<i>&gt;represented by the popularity of their publications.</i><br>
