In a message dated 98-06-27 12:40:23 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Leaving aside Mr. Starr's politics, his rudeness, boorishness, or what have<br>
you,<br>
 that he is merely trying to ascertain the truth or falsity of two sworn court<br>
 affadavits, which are in direct contradiction to the taped conversations of<br>
one<br>
 of those swearants, and contradictory to the established pattern of behavior<br>
of<br>
 the other swearant, seems to be completely ignored by all who see benefit in<br>
 ignoring justice, honesty, and integrity in our elected public officials &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Michael, I understand the importance of that aspect.  Truly.  But the methods<br>
use to discover the truth in the matter frighten me and I feel they ought to<br>
concern anyone who values their privacy and freedom, as I know you do.  <br>
Starr has gone way past the bounds of diligent public service and has asked<br>
for the ability to get his information using seemingly any methods available,<br>
regardless of the legality or ethicity. ( not sure that is a word, but I think<br>
you know what I mean.)<br>
<p>
For the record, I voted for Clinton, but have been consistently disappointed<br>
in him.  <br>
I not a fan nor a defender of the man.  If he's broken the law, I hope he is<br>
caught and punished.  I simply disagree with the means being used to find out<br>
if he has or not.<br>
<p>
Starr seems the sort that would have felt right at home in Torquemadas' little<br>
clique.  <br>
No doubt feeling righteous and right the whole time.  The man makes me sick.<br>
<p>
Cori<br>
