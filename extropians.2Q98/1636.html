<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;same product at a lower price.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Please define these 'externalities'. I still don't see how I benefit to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;my market stolen from me..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not saying you do benefit from having competitors.  Indeed, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; primarily us consumers who benefit from your competition.</i><br>
<p>
SO you admit it. However, you don't seem to answer the question as to why anyone<br>
would invent anything if they didn't get paid for it. Name me one civilization in<br>
which there was a similar level of invention as there currently is in the present<br>
day, yet did not protect the intellectual property of inventors? You can't can<br>
you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; without copyright, all firms benefit from invention.  Suppose your firm is</i><br>
<i>&gt; producing goods in a regular competitive economy with normal supply and</i><br>
<i>&gt; demand curves:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Price |\_           _/ &lt;-- supply</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |  \_       _/</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |    \_   _/</i><br>
<i>&gt;    P* |______\_/</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |     _/^\_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |   _/  |  \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       | _/    |    \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |/      |      \ &lt;-- demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;       ----------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;               Q*</i><br>
<i>&gt;            Quantity</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We imagine that you make a variety of goods, and this demand curve</i><br>
<i>&gt; represents the demand for all the different goods you might make in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; competitive market.  OK, now suppose you invent something new.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention is a "sunk cost": it does not add to your marginal costs (see</i><br>
<i>&gt; below) and so it does not change the shape of your supply curve.  (This may</i><br>
<i>&gt; not necessarily be true; making a sensor may be more costly the other goods</i><br>
<i>&gt; which you make currently, or it may be cheaper.  However, because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect is ambiguous, we can presume that it doesn't change your supply</i><br>
<i>&gt; curve.  Even if it does, this doesn't affect my argument.)  Nonetheless, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; DOES increase the demand for your goods, since you now attract new buyers</i><br>
<i>&gt; who want to buy your new product.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |\_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |  \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |    \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |      \_</i><br>
<i>&gt; Price |\_      \_   _/ &lt;-- supply</i><br>
<i>&gt;    P**|--\_------\_/</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |    \_   _/^\_</i><br>
<i>&gt;    P* |______\_/  |  \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |     _/^\_ |    \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |   _/  |  \_      \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       | _/    |   |\_      \_</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |/      |   |  \       \  &lt;--- new demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;       ---------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;               Q*  Q**</i><br>
<i>&gt;            Quantity</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Where P** and Q** are the new price and quantity.  As this graph shows, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; reap increased revenues thanks to the invention, even under a market where</i><br>
<i>&gt; you don't have copyright protection.  To be specific, you reap extra</i><br>
<i>&gt; revenues given by the trapezoid formed by the y-axis, the old price line,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the supply curve and the new price line.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So what did I mean by externalities?  Well, just as your firm will receive</i><br>
<i>&gt; the money in that trapezoid, so will all other firms who produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; "knock-offs."  You will all EACH receive the quantity inside that</i><br>
<i>&gt; trapezoid.  Thus, invention has positive externalities on other suppliers.</i><br>
<p>
Ok, this is obvious. What benefit is it to ME that somebody is benefitting from<br>
my invention without paying me for the favor?  Altruism aside, you still cannot<br>
answer this question because you automatically assume that others benefitting<br>
from my intelligence without paying me for it gives me some sort of net benefit.<br>
I don't put much value in the only benefit being that some cheapskates think that<br>
I am some 'cool dude'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Meanwhile, it IS worthwhile to pay for invention, even if the invention is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not protected with a government monopoly, if the area inside your trapezoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; is equal to or greater than the cost of invention.  Indeed, the larger your</i><br>
<i>&gt; stake in the market, the more worthwhile invention is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If I set my prices arbitrarily high, I limit my sales to those for whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;money is no object. This is a very small market. If I charge a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;price for my invention, based on its' costs and a fair payment to me for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;development, I should have more takers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's look at what you're saying economically.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You correctly point out that if you set the price arbitrarily high, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't have as many takers as if you set the price somewhat lower.  I agree</i><br>
<i>&gt; with this; monopolies do not get to set their own revenues, they only get</i><br>
<i>&gt; to set the market price without worrying about competitors.  So we imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you demand curve looks like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Price |\__</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |   \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |      \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |         \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |            \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |               \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |                  \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;       |                      \  &lt;-- demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;       -----------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;              Quantity</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, because you are the only source of this particular good, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; represent the entire market for that good.</i><br>
<p>
This is the central fallacy of your argument. You treat an invention as a<br>
monopoly product of a monopoly inventor.  In fact, in any idea market, there are<br>
almost always several ways to accomplish something. Technology A, technology B<br>
and technology C, all of which solve problem #1, may be invented by entirely<br>
different people, and thus, you have a competetive market for technologies to<br>
accomplish a certain thing. I ran into this in the energy saving lighting market<br>
several years ago. A may have only half of the up front cost of B, but is twice<br>
as expensive to operate over time. They may have identical costs, and are only<br>
different in maybe their aesthetic value, or maybe those are identical as well.<br>
In any event, your problem is that you treat solutions (i.e. inventions) as<br>
monopoly items, when they are not. Only PROBLEMS are unique. There are almost<br>
always several ways to solve a problem.<br>
