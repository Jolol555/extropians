&lt;&lt; What, like faith that it is impossible to (or that we<br>
 shouldn't) overcome evil and all that which ails us?  After all, if<br>
 there is a God, we must find some way to justify why God hasn't<br>
 overcome evil.  If an all powerful God can't (or shouldn't) overcome<br>
 evil, we must abandon all hope that we can (or should) overcome evil<br>
 with our science.  If God can't, how can we?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
That's an unsound argument.  Suppose that we find some reason R that<br>
reconciles the existence of God (an omnipotent, omniscient, autonomous,<br>
benevolent being) with the existence of evil.<br>
There is no reason that I can see to think that R necessarily entails that 1)<br>
evil will never be overcome or 2) we should not overcome evil.  <br>
<p>
Furthermore, if R can provide a case for why a benevolent God allows evil,<br>
then it's possible that R is also applicable to our actions, and thus provides<br>
a reason for us to allow evil.  And if that's the case, then we've merely<br>
discovered that to do right we must allow some evil.  To word as though we've<br>
"lost all hope of conquering evil" is simply to lose sight of the fact that<br>
we've discovered a reason showing a particular treatment of evil to be the<br>
ethically correct treatment.<br>
