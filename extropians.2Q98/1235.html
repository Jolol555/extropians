<i>&gt; &gt;These industries are not "kept in place" by government coercion, </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, there is a distinct difference.  Consider it in terms of economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply and demand curves.  The very first copy of a book is quite expensive</i><br>
<i>&gt; to produce, but subsequent copies are quite cheap.  The first copy of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; book requires time, creative energy and artistic skill, whereas subsequent</i><br>
<i>&gt; copies can be produced in bulk and require considerably less innovation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And perhaps most important of all, the artist very rarely actually DOES any</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the work involved in making copies of the book; this is a job best left</i><br>
<i>&gt; to printers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We should expect, then, that the artist should be paid for the services</i><br>
<i>&gt; rendered, for creating the very first copy of the book, because THAT copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually required the artist's services.  Art by commission is one such</i><br>
<i>&gt; example of an artist being paid for creating art, rather than for producing</i><br>
<i>&gt; copies of art.  Auctioning the first copy to the highest bidder would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; another strategy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, once multiple people have a copy, the artist and anyone else who</i><br>
<i>&gt; has a copy of the book fall into nearly perfect competition.  If the artist</i><br>
<i>&gt; offers a higher price for a copy of the book than anyone else, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason to buy from the artist; other copies are perfect substitutes.  Since</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're in nearly perfect competition, the market price for the book should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be no greater than the marginal cost, the cost to make one more book.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost, of course, is no  greater than the cost of printing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since an individual copy of a book costs almost nothing when it is in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hands of many, but costs much more when it is only in the hands of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; artist, then it seems reasonable that the artist should make a profit</i><br>
<i>&gt; EARLY, when the book is being created, rather than later, when the book is</i><br>
<i>&gt; being printed.</i><br>
<p>
In other words, the artist should get paid a certain amount for <br>
writing the book (who pays, and why?) without regard to whether many <br>
people prove they like it by, for example, buying copies.<br>
<p>
And in general it is never reasonable to spread the cost of <br>
production facilities (the author's work is an essential part of <br>
producing a book) over the entire production run.  The author must <br>
get his entire compensation for producing the book out of the sale <br>
price of the first book; the printer must get his entire <br>
compensation for creating the printshop out of the first item he <br>
prints.  The cost of building an auto manufacturing plant should be <br>
tacked IN ITS ENTIRETY onto the FIRST car that plant produces.<br>
<p>
Under that system it is painfully obvious that there will be very few <br>
auto plants built, and therefore very few cars made.  That there will <br>
be very few printshops built, and therefore very little printed.  Yet <br>
you assume that this will somehow INCREASE the number of books being <br>
written...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Eliminate copyrights and patents, and indirect payment ceases to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;exist; so the artists who live off that indirect payment -- the large </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;majority of those who can live off their art at all -- must turn to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;other fields.  They will produce less art, or no art at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Less art, but at a higher price, thanks to auctioning/commision.  It is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; clear, then, that the artists' revenues will contract.</i><br>
<p>
Higher price?<br>
<p>
It is true, if you want to hear the group Sublime, you will have to <br>
hire the group to come to you, and this will cost more than if you <br>
could just run down and buy a CD.  However, it is also true that the <br>
maximum you are likely to pay is far, far less than their portion of <br>
the sales price of a quarter million CDs.<br>
<p>
So, YOU pay a HIGHER price, but THEY collect a LOWER price.<br>
<p>
Not to mention that all the people involved in producing, shipping, <br>
and marketing the CDs, must seek some other source of income -- not <br>
because their jobs are obsolete, but because we deny creative people <br>
ownership of their creations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;How does driving artists away from art and into other fields, produce </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more art?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; See above.</i><br>
<p>
The above does not answer the question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Poor example.  How about this one:  The aviation industry, having a hard</i><br>
<i>&gt; time cartelizing, convinced the government to do it for them, setting up</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Civil Aeronautics Administration in 1938.  (Later to become the Civil</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aeronautics Board, CAB.)  Until deregulation in the 70s, it was allowed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; set interstate airline rates and prevent new interstate airlines from</i><br>
<i>&gt; forming.  By setting a minimum price which no member of the cartel could</i><br>
<i>&gt; legally break and by preventing new airlines from forming, the cartel had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; coerced monopoly over interstate aviation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Were passengers receiving the benefit of interstate transportation?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously.  Were they paying a fair rate for this benefit?  No, absolutely</i><br>
<i>&gt; not.</i><br>
<p>
You are entirely free, today, to write books and give them away if <br>
you choose.  You were not free, then, to open an airline and give <br>
away air transportation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In this case, by not allowing new companies to make copies, the artist</i><br>
<i>&gt; gains a coerced monopoly over book copies; as a result, the artist can set</i><br>
<i>&gt; a much higher price than the copies are actually worth.</i><br>
<p>
No company other than United Airlines ever has, or ever will, provide <br>
you a flight on United Airlines' work.  So if you ever had a United <br>
Airlines flight, United Airlines was rewarded for your benefitting <br>
from their work.<br>
<p>
Anybody can go to a cheap copier and provide you a flight on Anne <br>
McCaffrey's work.  And Anne McCaffrey will receive no reward for your <br>
benefitting from her work.<br>
<p>
That said, I agree with you: setting a minimum price which people <br>
*must* charge for their work, is wrong.  But instead you propose to <br>
set a *maximum* price, and that is just as wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The novel-writer simply wants to be paid by the novel-reader.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The novel-reader is not buying the work of the novel-writer.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; novel-reader is receiving the work of the novel-printer.</i><br>
<p>
What are those black marks on the pages?  Their arrangement is the <br>
work of the novel-writer.  If you think that it is the <br>
novel-printer's work that matters, go buy a hundred pages of notebook <br>
filler paper and enjoy your reading.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Think of it this way:  the novel writer is making the mold from which</i><br>
<i>&gt; millions of cheap statues can be formed.  Since this is true, the writer</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be paid for the mold, not for the statues.</i><br>
<p>
The writer should be paid according to the agreement the writer makes <br>
with the publisher.  You should not have the right to dictate the <br>
terms of that agreement, considering that you are neither the writer <br>
nor the publisher.  Sometimes the agreement will specify that the <br>
publisher is paying only for a mold, and sometimes it's on a per-copy <br>
basis.<br>
<p>
What we find in general in the fixed arts (which means, pretty much <br>
everything except live performances) is that the top artists are paid <br>
on some form of per-copy basis, and the hacks are paid for molds.  <br>
And the hacks hope to get per-copy contracts.  Some of them <br>
eventually become top artists.<br>
<p>
Writing specifically is a bit different, but not a whole lot <br>
different.  Magazines pay for molds.  Book contracts are almost <br>
always on a per-copy basis, with an "advance" that is non-refundable <br>
and amounts to a payment for the mold if the book doesn't sell well.  <br>
Let me give you a clue: if you spend six months per book, and never <br>
get any payment beyond the advance, you won't be able to live for <br>
long as a book writer.  But you propose to eliminate all other <br>
payment, and believe that this will increase the amount of art.<br>
<p>
Look at it further down the line: a publisher starts printing a book <br>
in the belief that for a certain amount of time HE will be the ONLY <br>
publisher of that specific book.  On this basis he dedicates the <br>
substantial capital of a printing plant to that book for a period of <br>
time, and he puts some effort into marketing the book.  And he <br>
enforces his copyright to protect that assumption.<br>
<p>
But you choose to eliminate the copyright.  The publisher sends the <br>
books out of his shop.  Of the first five boxes, three go to <br>
copy-shop chains.  The publisher paid the author an advance, and put <br>
in the capital and resources to print 25,000 copies of the book; the <br>
next day there are 250,000 copies on the market.  For every dollar <br>
the publisher spent in marketing, $8 are spent on copies of the book, <br>
and the publisher gets 80 cents of that.  Being a publisher who <br>
actually pays authors, is a complete loss.  So publishers won't pay <br>
authors, and this is supposed to increase the amount of art.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;If the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reader chooses to not read that novel, its author expects no payment. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But novel-writers who receive no payment and have no reason to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;expect any payment in the future, tend to stop writing novels.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Without copyrights, there would be no expectation of payment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, the writer CAN expect payment.  The author can write by commission,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or auction the work to the highest bidder.</i><br>
<p>
Today, an author can auction a work to the highest bidder -- who will <br>
probably be a publishing house and will probably pay $10,000 for a <br>
first novel, or $1,000,000 for something from someone with multiple <br>
previous hot sellers.<br>
<p>
Under your system, an author can auction a work to the highest bidder <br>
-- who will probably pay $8 for a first novel, and there will be no <br>
such thing as a "hot seller".  Why?  Because being the *second* <br>
highest bidder means you can't publish the book -- until half an hour <br>
after the highest bidder does.  And the 8,427th highest bidder can <br>
publish at exactly the same time you can.<br>
<p>
If you don't think writing a good novel is hard work, try it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And while I am sure we all agree that 90% of all art produced today </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is crap, we don't necessarily agree on *which* 90%.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's why we let the market decide.</i><br>
<p>
And you want to eliminate the means by which the market communicates <br>
its decision.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actually, this is the best reason of all to abandon intellectual property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 90% of what's written today is crap because authors don't bear the full</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost of a failed writing enterprise.</i><br>
<p>
Under the current system, authors do bear the full cost of a failed <br>
writing enterprise: they put all the work into writing the book, and <br>
no publisher buys it.  On the other hand, if their writing enterprise <br>
is successful, they reap the rewards.<br>
<p>
Under your system, authors bear the full cost of a failed writing <br>
enterprise -- ALWAYS -- even if the book is a massive success.<br>
