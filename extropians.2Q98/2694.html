I've quite enjoyed the eloquent elucidations offered on this thread.  I<br>
wanted to humbly include my perspective regarding  the debate on free will.<br>
IMHO, no one is really "waking down their own path".  It seems clear to me<br>
that we are constrained and directed by countless influences, both genetic<br>
and environmental. As difficult as it is for the western, individualistic<br>
mind to accept, free will as we generally understand it is a myth.<br>
Behaviorism (stimulus-response, rewards and punishments) is the most<br>
empirically supported psychological theory we've generated.  We now embrace<br>
the Cognitive-Behavioral theory because we accept that we are clearly not<br>
born as blank slates (i.e. genetics does indeed account for a sizable<br>
percentage of our behavior), and we accept that it is not that useful to<br>
ignore cognitions and focus solely on observable behavior. The point being,<br>
however, that a large portion of the theory of Behaviorism holds water<br>
regardless of the fact that it eschews the notion of freedom of choice.  We<br>
all utilize behavior modification techniques in an attempt to control the<br>
actions of others (especially children and underlings) and we are often<br>
successful in our manipulations. When we're not, it's probably because we<br>
haven't properly analyzed the stimus-response complex.  Do those whose<br>
behaviors are thus manipulated have free will?  I don't think I'd sign up<br>
with Radical Behaviorists and declare there is no choice whatsoever.  But<br>
our ability to exercise free will is probably far more attenuated than we<br>
generally recognize.  Transhumanism/Extropiasm, it seems to me, is all about<br>
utilizing technology to unconstrain ourselves and achieve greater freedom<br>
from the delimiters that currently plague our species.<br>
