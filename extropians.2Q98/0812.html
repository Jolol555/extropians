See my post earlier today (4/24) on the "abolition of work."  Jobs would<br>

near future.  Even as output keeps increasing thanks to increased<br>
automation, demand for labor keeps increasing at least as fast, if not faster.<br>

<p>
First of all, I should state that I am one of those economists who believes<br>
that unemployment happens by choice; that workers rationally choose to be<br>
unemployed (except when there is a legally enforced minimum wage).  Most<br>
people find this antithetical to their current worldview, so it will<br>
require a bit of defense.<br>
<p>
First, I assert that anybody could work as a volunteer if they so desired.<br>
This is not what most would consider a job, but the fact is that they could<br>
do so and would have no trouble at all finding people who would appreciate<br>
their service, if not pay them for it.  So I take it as self evident that<br>
there is ample (if not infinite) demand for free labor.  :)<br>
<p>
Next, I adopt the law of demand, which simply states that the market will<br>
demand a quantity of a given good based upon its price, and that the higher<br>
the price of a good, the fewer the market will wish to buy, all else being<br>
equal.  It is this law which is normally used to presume the existence of a<br>
demand curve in microeconomic markets.  It is represented like this:<br>
<p>
Wages |\_                         <br>
<i>      |  \_         </i><br>
<i>      |    \_     </i><br>
<i>      |      \_ </i><br>
<i>      |        \_</i><br>
<i>      |          \_</i><br>
<i>      |            \_</i><br>
<i>      |              \            </i><br>
      ----------------------<br>
            Employment<br>
<p>
This graph simply repeats what I said above, only visually.  When wages are<br>
low, or zero, the amount of employment demanded is great.  However, as<br>
wages increase, less and less employment is demanded, up until the point<br>
where wages are simply so high that no workers are demanded at all.<br>
<p>
Finally, I assert that there is a minimum wage which almost no workers will<br>
accept.  This is also self-evident.  Just as most workers will not work for<br>
free, they will also refuse to work at the wage of one cent per year.<br>
(Though in some post-colonial nations, it's getting pretty close.)<br>
However, the point is that they COULD work for this wage; they just choose<br>
not to.  Similarly, we can represent this with a supply curve, based on the<br>
law of supply which states that the greater the wages paid, the more<br>
employment workers are prepared to put out.  Set against the demand curve,<br>
it looks like this:<br>
<p>
Wages |\_           _/ &lt;-- supply<br>
<i>      |  \_       _/</i><br>
<i>      |    \_   _/</i><br>
   W* |______\_/<br>
<i>      |     _/^\_</i><br>
<i>      |   _/  |  \_</i><br>
<i>      | _/    |    \_</i><br>
<i>      |/      |      \ &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      ----------------------<br>
              E*<br>
           Employment<br>
<p>
<p>
Almost no workers work for 0 wages, while more and more are willing to work<br>
as wages increase.  Eventually, the supply curve intersects the demand<br>
curve.  Workers would be prepared to work at a higher wage than where these<br>
intersect, but there is no buyer who demands labor so much that they are<br>
willing to pay that wage.  Similarly, no buyer can cut wages lower that the<br>
supply curve without cutting back the number of workers employed.<br>
<p>
So as you can see from these assertions, there should be no involuntary<br>
unemployment, (except for temporary or "frictional" unemployment which may<br>
result from, say, having been fired VERY recently).  X workers will not<br>
accept wages lower than wage W, but the market only demands Y workers at<br>
wage W (where Y is less than X); therefore, X - Y workers will simply<br>
refuse to work.<br>
<p>
In saying this, I am not saying "Oh, those silly poor.  They COULD have a<br>
job if they'd just turn the other cheek and accept a lower wage," because<br>
quite frankly some wages are just so low that they are simply not worth the<br>
effort, particularly to someone who is starving or who must support a<br>
hungry family.  1 cent per year, for example, is not worth the effort, and<br>
I would not consider someone lazy for not accepting it.  Unemployment is<br>
real, and the ability of a person to feed themselves in many cases may not<br>
be within their grasp.  I'm not trying to say that the poor are poor<br>
because they are lazy.<br>
<p>
However, I DO contend that we should stop examining the question from the<br>
perspective of "where are all of the jobs going?" and instead ask ourselves<br>
the question "why are wages so low?"  Because, as I think I have shown, the<br>
jobs go when the wages drop, and the jobs reappear when wages increase.  In<br>
other words, if buyers were prepared to pay more for the same employment,<br>
more workers would be willing/able to work at that wage.  What this would<br>
mean is an increase in the over all demand curve, which might look like this:<br>
<p>
<i>      |\_</i><br>
<i>      |  \_</i><br>
<i>      |    \_</i><br>
Wages |\_ --&gt;\_     _/ &lt;-- supply<br>
<i>      |  \_    \_ _/</i><br>
   W* |____\_ ___*_<br>
<i>      |______\_/ ^ \_</i><br>
<i>      |     _/ \_|   \_</i><br>
<i>      |   _/     \_    \_</i><br>
<i>      | _/       | \_--&gt; \_</i><br>
<i>      |/         |   \     \      </i><br>
      ---------------------------<br>
                 E*<br>
           Employment<br>
<p>
So what we see here, and which was my whole point, is that so long as<br>
demand keeps growing, more and more workers will be employed.  For<br>
comparison, automation leads to an increase in the aggregate supply curve:<br>
more total output at a lower price; as a result, the wage level drops in<br>
order to be able to compete with the low cost of capital; eventually, the<br>
wage is so low that it's not even worth going to work.<br>
<p>
So what can we do about this?  As noted, if demand for labor keeps<br>
increasing, then we can keep unemployment low.  Alternately, if we can<br>
increase wages by any other means, this would also decrease unemployment.<br>
One good way to deal with this is through education, which increases the<br>
wage which people can get on the market.  Finally, by keeping the price<br>
level low (ie avoiding inflation,) workers will find it increasingly<br>
acceptable to accept a lower wage, because the price of goods will remain<br>
low, and will keep getting lower if automation does everything it's<br>
supposed to do.<br>
<p>
And luckily for the unemployed, the free market is already out to do all of<br>
these things for us; though perhaps not as quickly as we might like.  The<br>
demand for all goods is increasing, particularly as the population<br>
increases, people get more ambitious, and advertising gets more prevalent.<br>
Moreover, the poor's income/consumption adjusted for inflation as a general<br>
trend is rising, and continues to rise and fall with the growth of the<br>
economy (which, for now, is strong).  Similarly, the poor do see the value<br>
of education, and the income effect can be seen most readily in people's<br>
demand for education.  College enrollment is many times what it was earlier<br>
in this century, and other low cost sources for education are becoming<br>
increasingly prevalent.  And finally, inflation is at an all time low,<br>
thanks in part to the very automation which you fear, and in part by the<br>
skillful meddling of Alan Greenspan.  (Nota bene, lf-capitalists:<br>
sometimes, when you get REALLY smart people in government, you almost do as<br>
well as you could under competition. :))<br>
<p>
So if you're worried about the poor being replaced by capital, stop<br>
worrying.  Instead, we should think about ways we can streamline this<br>
economy and eliminate the impediments to its growth.<br>
