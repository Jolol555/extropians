In a message dated 98-04-17 23:27:51 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; That is extremely *slow* compared to what is being discussed.<br>
 <br>
 Consider that the fastest manned military aircraft cannot fly fast <br>
 enough to stay directly under a low-orbit satellite, and the <br>
 satellite is going much faster than such an aircraft would need to <br>
 go; and something down at ground level must go considerably faster <br>
 to be considered orbital.  Heck, the main reason for evacuating the <br>
 tube is that at that speed, simply running into air would be a <br>
 serious problem.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It seems this kind of transportation would be best for things that can take<br>
the g force (im not sure what it would be) to put them in orbit (like special<br>
cargo, and humans maybe).  How would we burst them into orbit each time?  It<br>
would be cool to just have things in underground orbit (like continuous<br>
orbits), Im sure it would be useful somehow.  Would the tube have to be a<br>
perfect ring and would it also have to be relevant to the spin of the planet?<br>
