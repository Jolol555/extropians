Wait a second.  This says that A relative to A is non-zero; to my reading,<br>
A is + relative to A.  This is complete absurdity: nothing is large<br>
relative to itself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Because size is relative, A appears to in-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    crease in size when measuring B.</i><br>
<p>
A does not increase in size relative to itself; so A relative to A must<br>
always be 0.  A DECREASES in size relative to B.  There is no perspective<br>
from which A increases in size.  I might accept a second matrix if it were<br>
valid, but that particular one isn't. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    As A looks</i><br>
<i>&gt;    at B, observer A could equally assume he had </i><br>
<i>&gt;    increased in size just as the observer in one </i><br>
<i>&gt;    train looking at another train next to him out </i><br>
<i>&gt;    the window seeing motion and may assume either</i><br>
<i>&gt;    his train or the other is in motion, and either</i><br>
<i>&gt;    assumption is equally correct.  Observer B also</i><br>
<i>&gt;    assumes he may have increased in size. So net </i><br>
<i>&gt;    difference is found in the sum of the matrices.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    One size-matrix doesn't contain all difference.</i><br>
<p>
This would be true if A were actually stretching relative to anything. <br>
However, NO perspective sees A increase in size.  I would grant you that<br>
in normal Newtonian physics if you saw me shrinking relative to you, it<br>
would be a safe presumption that you were stretching relative to me, but<br>
not in special relativity.  I am shrinking relative to you AND you are<br>
shrinking relative to me.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;    Dan, it's a great counter(!) worthy of further</i><br>
<i>&gt;    investigation, but it can only be sustained if </i><br>
<i>&gt;    it can be shown that size is not relative and </i><br>
<i>&gt;    thus that one matrix is more valid, but even </i><br>
<i>&gt;    that "more vs less" valid is another 0 sum.</i><br>
<p>
Well, perhaps you meant a different second matrix; any matrix which shows<br>
A non-zero relative to itself is fishy, I'd say.  Perhpas you'd want to<br>
say that:<br>
<p>
   A  B<br>
A  0  +<br>
B  +  0<br>
<p>
is true if we compare the second situation to the first, rather than the<br>
first to the second.  The only problem with this matrix is that it is<br>
never true; B is never large relative to A.  B is never large relative to<br>
ANYTHING; at rest it is zero, and in motion it is negative relative to A.<br>
Since you cannot find any perspective in which A or B are positive, I<br>
sincerely doubt your ability to get back to 0 from the -.<br>
<p>
Good luck!<br>
