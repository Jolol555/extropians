<p>
But, in egoism wouldn't the correct question be,<br>
"if *I* were an Egoist would *I* be better off?”<br>
Again, it seems you are judging egoism by the<br>
standards of utilitarianism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I argue that objectivism is wrong because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires one to perform irrational actions in</i><br>
<i>&gt; order to do the right thing, which is contrary</i><br>
<i>&gt; to our earlier presumption that the right action</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the rational one.  With this alone, we could</i><br>
<i>&gt; not reject simple egoism; if we add</i><br>
<i>&gt; generalization to this rule, however, egoism</i><br>
<i>&gt; fails the test, leaving us, IMO, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; utilitarianism.</i><br>
<p>
What I'm failing to see is how generalisation can<br>
be justified *without* utilitarianism. It is the<br>
idea of fitting ethics to that which you already<br>
believe, that I find irrational.<br>
<p>
If generalisation is detrimental to the egoist,<br>
then the egoist should insure that others do the<br>
wrong thing. That does not seem logically<br>
inconsistent. Wouldn't this make it the most<br>
rational choice?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even simple egoism may require us to commit</i><br>
<i>&gt; suicide if we will experience more pain than</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasure in the remainder of our lives (though</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is arguable).</i><br>
<p>
Would this apply to the immortalist? Surely you<br>
can make no such assumption when faced with the<br>
possibility of eternal life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You may choose to reject the generalization</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle; if so, simple egoism seems the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational to me.  However, if we DO accept the</i><br>
<i>&gt; generalization principle, I think that we must</i><br>
<i>&gt; accept utilitarianism.</i><br>
<p>
The problem is, I see no rational reason to accept<br>
the generalisation principle.<br>
