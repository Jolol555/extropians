<i>&gt; Over the last several years I have become a big advocate for</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-markets.  However, there has been some nagging questions that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have yet to answer without resorting to some form of socialism in order</i><br>
<i>&gt; to solve.  Can any free-market advocate answer any and/or all of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; following questions:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Is there a single field which is intrinsically safe from automation</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the course of the next 20-30 years?  If you can think of more fields,</i><br>
<i>&gt; please elaborate.</i><br>
<p>
a: Jerry Springer Show guests ;)b: writers<br>
c: artists<br>
d: scientific researchers<br>
e: explorers<br>
f: colonizers<br>
g: politicians<br>
h: lawyers<br>
i: plaintiffs<br>
j: teachers<br>
k: strippers<br>
l: robot maintenance<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Are these remaining fields if any, sufficient to employ the majority</i><br>
<i>&gt; of humanity?  If not, what will the rest of humanity do in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; survive?</i><br>
<p>
have fun? explore new worlds? maintain the machines?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  For those who are unemployed and do not have sufficient investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; income, is death the inevitable result?  If not, how will they survive?</i><br>
<p>
considering that the more free and capitalistic a society is, the more it<br>
tends to privately fund charitable organizations, and recruit volunteers for<br>
charitable organizaitons,  then a future economy should free people up to<br>
help improve the lives of others through volunteer organizations. I think<br>
that education will be the great growth industry along with mind network<br>
interfacing.<br>
<p>
Education will not mean just learning facts, which will be easy in such a<br>
world, but will be teaching others HOW to learn and think efficiently.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4) Will most people alive today be able to save enough before their jobs</i><br>
<i>&gt; become automated?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From my experience, the more productive my job becomes, the more I get paid</i><br>
for it. By that time I should be making the equivalent of a Major League<br>
athlete's salary....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5) If how much money one has saved is the the key to surviving</i><br>
<i>&gt; automation, does this not portend very badly for young people who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; had less time to save for their forced retirement?  If this is true,</i><br>
<i>&gt; does this mean that the future is going to be populated almost entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt; of rich and old people and their children?</i><br>
<p>
you have no idea, nor do I of the sort of economic trends that have yet to<br>
even start, but will be branched off from the technologies we can currently<br>
conceptualize. It is too soon to tell.  However, based on past history, I am<br>
rather optimistic.<br>
