Bill Calvin's new book (with Derek Bickerton), *Lingua ex machina*, tries<br>
to solve the evolution of language:<br>
<p>
============<br>
<p>
... it has been difficult to identify nonlanguage predecessors of<br>
structured language.     Most books on language evolution seem to dissolve<br>
into a series of vague generalities when it comes to deal with specific<br>
issues, such as how language acquired its universal characteristics, or<br>
what novel processes in the brain made language possible. The linguists<br>
haven't known the relevant neurology or evolutionary theory, and the brain<br>
researchers haven't known enough linguistics to realize what features<br>
required a detailed explanation. And there is, in addition, the requirement<br>
of continuity: How do your proposed mechanisms create an easy series of<br>
improvements or conversions of function, stages that span the whole<br>
distance, starting with chimpanzeelike utterances, working up to words and<br>
protolanguage, and finally to the phrases and clauses that enable you to<br>
say "I think I saw him leave to go home" with its nested embedding?<br>
<p>
     We do it here with about two-and-a-half preadaptations, yielding both<br>
argument structure and phrase structure or, if you prefer, the newer<br>
minimalist grammar. The coin in which these improvements were purchased was<br>
that of reciprocal altruism, cognitive categories handy for detecting<br>
cheaters, and of ballistic movement planning, handy for toolmaking and<br>
hunting. <br>
