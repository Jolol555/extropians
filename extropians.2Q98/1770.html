<i>&gt; Can we really put a definite definition to the word truth?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you believe we can then consider:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. truth is in the eye of the beholder</i><br>
<i>&gt;   2. bias truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;      a. hitler is viewed as evil by the majority for ordering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; death of millions,  yet Einstien is viewed as good when in actuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; he killed millions more than hitler</i><br>
<p>
Name them. THis is a bald faced lie. If you are claiming that deaths due to nuclear power are his fault, his primary responsibility,<br>
recall that he was not involved in the Manhattan Project in any way. All he ever did was write a letter to President Roosevelt for some<br>
colleagues who were the people who developed the bomb. Even if he was responsible, less than a couple hundred thousand people worldwide<br>
have died due to nuclear power, and most at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I would say that since nuclear power is what created the cold war,<br>
and the prospect of Nuclear Winter made us second guess the idea of fighting nuclear war, we have most certainly avoided an open and<br>
heinous Third World War between the Communist and Capitalist nations. In this scenario, we have to thank Einstein for saving billions of<br>
lives....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      b. Columbus discovered America, usually discovery is of the unknown (America was already known, and inhabited) and he never saw</i><br>
<i>&gt; America</i><br>
<p>
Columbus discovered the New World, which is made up of all bodies of land connected to or neighboring the continents of North and South<br>
America.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3. my truth is not necessarily your truth, and yours not mine</i><br>
<p>
Since truth is merely highly accurate information, if you have information A and I have information B,  whoever has the most accurate<br>
information is the one who has THE truth. You may beleive that the sky is yellow, while I may beleive that it is blue. Spectral analysis<br>
of the light the atmosphere diffuses will fall within that band of the spectrum which any human being will call 'blue'. Therefore I know<br>
an absolute truth, while you are merely either misinformed or self deceived, or both.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4. truth is only a test of you collected knowledge, there fore the</i><br>
<i>&gt; more knowledge the more truth</i><br>
<p>
The more accurate the knowledge is, the closer to an absolute truth it is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5. all truth has the option of being bias</i><br>
<p>
i.e. all information is capable of being distorted by a liar. A liar cannot tell the truth, therefore, biased information is not truth.<br>
