Imaging, as distinct from 'reading' or 'uploading' is already here in<br>
several forms. PET scans, MRI, and CT are well known, and resolution is<br>
increasing steadily.<br>
<p>
The problem I see here is: Does anyone really know how memories are stored -<br>
is it holographic, physical location, or wiring? Is the brain serial or<br>
parallel in it's processing? How much of the brain's activity is electrical<br>
and how much is chemical, when it comes to actual thought?<br>
<p>
We are still in the infancy of learning exactly how the brain works...<br>
