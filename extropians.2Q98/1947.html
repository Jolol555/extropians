It's your call.  I would like to see how the Ayn Rand Institute and the<br>
Institute for Humane Studies runs these contests so we don't have to<br>
reinvent the wheel.<br>
<p>
We will also need to raise money and decide on categories -- like<br>
cryonics, space colonization, nanotechnology, the Singularity(ies),<br>
uploading, &amp;c.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
