I'm not worried about dogs and cats adapting.  They'll be fine.  I was<br>
thinking more about how the nature of our relationship with them may change<br>
as we and they evolve.  I think that what we like most about our pets is<br>
that they love us unconditionally.  But if we were to assist them in<br>
becoming trans-pets and they become conscious and self-aware, would they<br>
still love us unconditionally or might they want their freedom.  Would we<br>
want to genetically arrange it so they did not value freedom?  Imagine being<br>
the person that you currently are except that you have a master who expects<br>
unconditional love.  This master would certainly seem god-like.  Hmmm.<br>
Maybe the pervasiveness of religious groups on the planet suggests that we<br>
seek such a master for ourselves.<br>
