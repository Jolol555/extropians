I think its a valuable idea. Id like to suggest that the editors of the<br>
book might consider publishing the essays in the book after first<br>
sumbitting them to several peer reviewers. For instance, the Max Moore's<br>
paper on PCR makes all sense to me, and I think a similar one should be<br>
included in a book like that, but it could be prudent to first send it to<br>
several philosophers, and whose field is epistemology at that.. Its just an<br>
example, I dont think anybody would find anything wrong with that<br>
particular paper, its just no other essay comes to my mind right now. At<br>
worst, such process helps just polishing the style, at best, to pinpoint<br>
any bugs which might be there. <br>
