<i>&gt; safety COSTS, since accidental deployment of either system would tend to ruin</i><br>
<i>&gt; your whole day . . .</i><br>

Yes, I agree that parachutes are impractical in most scenarios. I just<br>
find it hard to forget the fact that 150+ people had 1/2 hr. to  bail<br>
out in the crash I saw on TV. I mean, the plane hit the ground at 200+<br>
mph !! I like your idea of a foaming system.<br>

Yes, this sounds good too, as did your other suggestions.<br>
<p>
Extrapolating here, I think in the (distant ?) future, when we have<br>
mature nanotech', it will be possible to design full body armour for<br>
people that will protect them from otherwise fatal accidents. But maybe<br>
by that time posthumans won't be inhabiting "flesh" bodies anyway! And<br>
then there's uploading...<br>
<p>
Thank you everybody else for your suggestions<br>
