I would separate meditation from relaxation although they share the same<br>
basis. In fact, meditation seems to be relaxation combined with a high<br>
level of awareness. Contrary to relaxation (which often occurs while<br>
sitted on an armchair, laying on a bed eyes closed, or even on the floor<br>
as in the yogic savasana posture), meditation includes some tension<br>
which have to be maintained during the whole session : the back<br>
straight, eyes open, hands or whole body in strange and hard to maintain<br>
postures, etc. Martial art can even be seen as medtation occuring in the<br>
stressing environment of fight! The results are, IMHO, very different.<br>
relaxation often finishes by sleep, meditation helps me to stay awake.<br>
<p>
As for "thinking more clearly", I'm not sure that meditation or<br>
relaxation can have a real effect on the value of rational thinking<br>
(except the fact that a relaxed body will probably concentrate more<br>
easily), but don't forget that people who created meditation methods<br>
were mystics and not specially interested in this field. this does not<br>
means there is nothing to do ! if meditation is "created" by changing<br>
the parameters of relaxation, we can perhaps change meditation by adding<br>
some new elements created especially in the purpose of increasing<br>
intelligence. for instance, combine meditation with Ars memoria, or<br>
doing martial arts movements to navigate in an abstract virtual<br>
interface representing some mathematical or scientifical truthes, in<br>
little like the tai-chi experiment at<br>
