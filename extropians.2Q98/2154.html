Great news!<br>
<p>
But...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       While some theorize that the approach could be used to create a pill</i><br>
<i>&gt;that would let us all live 40 percent longer — boosting average age from 80</i><br>
<i>&gt;to 110 — Phillips said that is not his intention. “There are too many social</i><br>
<i>&gt;implications,” he said. “Already there are problems with old-age pensions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;for example.”</i><br>
<p>
[small snip]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; “Life span was extended though</i><br>
<i>&gt;postponement of the onset of senescence.”</i><br>
<i>&gt;       In other words, he said, we could live our final days not in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;geriatric ward, but full of youthful energy.</i><br>
<p>
Same old same old tragic misunderstanding.  It's truly amazing how people<br>
*just can't get their heads around this crucial point*.  Even assuming that<br>
the nexus between jobs and income is bound to remain unchanged - an<br>
absurdity, given increased cybernation and eventually virtually cost-free<br>
nano minting of most consumables - commentators somehow seem stuck with the<br>
notion that if we *now* go on the pension at 60 or 65 because we are<br>
wearing out, we will *always* do so *at that age*, even if we are then in<br>
the prime of extended-longevity middle age.  Note the mournful `our final<br>
days', which has just a moment earlier been postulated as an additional 40<br>
percent of mid-life healthy lifespan.  <br>
<p>
We're going to have to work *hard* on this default meme, team.<br>
