Recently the list saw an impassioned attack on abortion by Reilly Jones,<br>
who construed this procedure as equivalent to murder and thought it<br>
revealed a profound moral decay in those who supported its ready<br>
availability.  An interesting treatment of new genetic issues by Lee Silver<br>
throws light on this topic.  I don't have time right now to go into detail,<br>
but I believe Silver's survey shows that Reilly's views are untenable *just<br>
on the facts* (and leaving `souls' out of the discussion).  For what it's<br>
worth as a teaser, I'll append below the text of a pop science review I've<br>
just done on Silver's book.  Mild warning: I've adopted a kind of<br>
spoon-feeding approach that feigns a measure of ignorance of the topic,<br>
because that seems to work best when introducing hard topics to a mass<br>
newspaper audience.<br>
<p>
==============================<br>
<p>
Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World<br>
By Lee M. Silver, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 315 pages, $39.95<br>
<p>
<p>
I thought I knew about the birds and bees, but Lee Silver, molecular<br>
biology professor at Princeton, taught me otherwise.  It turns out my<br>
mother didn't have just one brother, my uncle, but several other siblings<br>
just as close - because her father was a clone.<br>
<p>
I've been vaguely aware of this since childhood, when I first met<br>
grandfather Chris's identical twin brother.  I'd never heard of Dan, who<br>
lived interstate, until the creepy day I greeted a familiar, beloved man<br>
who didn't know me.  Laughter from the adults - but I howled at this<br>
uncanny duplication.<br>
<p>
Maybe just such unease is what makes people nervous, even revolted, by the<br>
prospect of human cloning and other disturbing feats of what Silver dubs<br>
`reprogenetics'.  When identity itself is up for grabs, what's to hold onto<br>
in an uncertain world?  <br>
<p>
Such anxieties fuel the persistent anger and alarm in the abortion debate.<br>
Does human personhood begin when parental DNA strands fuse into a unique<br>
living being?  Or is an embryo, or even a two-trimester foetus, not yet<br>
sufficiently complex or aware to be deemed a person?  In light of genetic<br>
profiling, bio-engineering, and now cloning (very soon, surely, of humans<br>
as well as other mammals), can science help us unpick these ethical issues?  <br>
<p>
Yes and no.  Our received values often derive from the best available<br>
scientific opinion - of the fourth century BC.  Is abortion murder?<br>
Adapting Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas taught that the male embryo only becomes<br>
a human being at six weeks, when God infuses a soul into the developing<br>
flesh.  Females have to wait until 13 weeks.  <br>
<p>
More recent Christian theologians update their science to about the middle<br>
of this century.  Human life, many hold, starts precisely at conception (a<br>
distressing opinion, given that at least 75 percent of all pregnancies<br>
abort spontaneously without benefit of baptism).  Silver, drawing upon<br>
molecular biology and IVF evidence, shows this can't be correct.  Indeed,<br>
an embryo doesn't even blend its parents' DNA until the two-cell stage, on<br>
the second day.  Even then, each cell in the replicating ball of tissue is<br>
identical until the fourth cycle of doubling.  Then the 16-cell clump<br>
splits into a core that will specialise into a baby and an outer shell<br>
growing into a disposable placenta.<br>
<p>
This developing tissue with its unique DNA pattern usually goes astray in<br>
various ways, most of them lethal.  Sometimes it splits, yielding twins or<br>
quins - natural clones.  Hence, the children of Chris and Dan shared<br>
exactly the same paternal inheritance: not cousins, but genetic brothers<br>
and sisters with different mothers.  <br>
<p>
Twenty years ago, Dr Sherman Silber transplanted a testicle from Terry<br>
Twomey into his sterile identical twin, Tim, afflicted with a rare<br>
developmental disorder.  Weird hi-tech incest?  Tim and Jannie's child<br>
can't be distinguished genetically from any that Tim might have fathered if<br>
he'd been born whole.  Yet Tim's son is also plainly the brother of Terry's<br>
three kids. <br>
<p>
Modern reprogenetics multiplies such conundrums dizzyingly.  What's a<br>
father and mother, and who's their child?  An unethical scientist might<br>
take 10 very early embryos prepared for 10 random IVF couples, and tease<br>
apart the eight cells of each.  Implanted into surrogate mothers, each of<br>
the 80 cells could now grow into a healthy baby.  We'd end up with 10 sets<br>
of octuplets.<br>
<p>
Go back a step.  While the 80 cells are segregated, pick one cell from each<br>
of the ten Petri dishes and fuse them together into 10 entirely new<br>
eight-cell mosaic embryos.  This is not fantasy - using mice and other<br>
mammals, it's common lab procedure.  Now you might have 10 babies born,<br>
each with numerous parents.  <br>
<p>
Here's the puzzle for theologians - if each original embryo has its soul<br>
divinely infused at conception, how are the souls reassigned when the cells<br>
get randomly recombined?  This is not a blasphemous thought-experiment -<br>
every year, natural errors cause twin eggs to merge into mosaic<br>
individuals, or chimeras.  Usually they grow up without special problems,<br>
though some intersex chimeras (boy and girl twins fused into one<br>
individuals) have ambiguous genitalia.  Do they have a double helping of<br>
souls?  How do such facts bias our moral evaluation of abortion?<br>
<p>
These are just the simplest starting points in Silver's astonishing,<br>
elaborate examination of next century's molecular revolution.  He helps us<br>
think through the facts and ethics of many wilder possibilities - children<br>
for gay couples sharing the heritage of both, detailed genetic scanning<br>
allowing parents to learn broadly how any given embryo would develop, so<br>
they might launch the life of one potential infant instead of another.  <br>
<p>
Eugenics?  Perhaps - but not, Silver argues, as stigmatised by association<br>
with Nazism and other abominations.  Yet the outcome might be a swelling<br>
genetic apartheid of rich and poor - enhanced GenRich with extended<br>
longevity and other gifts, resolute or desperate Naturals.  Silver blithely<br>
embraces this fate as the fruit of the American dream of consumer<br>
capitalism.  <br>
<p>
I don't expect this split to happen, actually, since other technologies<br>
like intelligent computers and molecular manufacturing - necessary anyway<br>
to foster advanced reprogenetics - will spread these options cheaply to<br>
everyone who chooses them.  It's likely, though, that humanity will<br>
speciate explosively - branching into something old, something wonderfully<br>
new, something borrowed and, by today's standards, something bleugh.<br>
