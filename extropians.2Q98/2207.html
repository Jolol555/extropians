<i>&gt; &gt;This is an irritatingly common misperception.  How does something being</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;mention that "synergistically much safer" is a lot of meaningless</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand-waving.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: I was also puzzled by the logic implied in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   statement that because it has more chemical agents</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and because they act together, it is safer. Not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   logical. But I suspect that rice yeast is safer</i><br>
<i>&gt;   than Mavcor, albeit not for the reasons cited.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   But the big issue here revolves around the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   defining of X as a "drug" and the subsequent</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and automatic ideation that if X = drug then</i><br>
<i>&gt;   X must be controlled by the federal Govt.</i><br>
<p>
This is the real issue. I wonder when red rice yeast will become a controlled<br>
substance. Of course, they haven't made tree bark illegal to chew on, even<br>
though it contains aspirin....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   To concede that to be true is to loose the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   case for individual liberty automatically,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   for the road to serfdom is then a semantics</i><br>
<i>&gt;   game of saying "If Y is a drug and is Z has</i><br>
<i>&gt;   effects like Y, then Z is also a drug, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;   thus the Government gets to control Z/you."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Especially when Z has been in use by people around the world for thousands of<br>
years with no need for regulation. That company X extracts the active ingredient<br>
of Z, figures out how to make a similar chemical that is much more potent, and<br>
patents that new compound, but tries some sort of recursive patenting of the<br>
natural substance through regulation is the most crass mercantilism..<br>
