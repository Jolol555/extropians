&lt;&lt; But information is a thing, and this is not just an esoteric nit pick, it's<br>
 very practical. The Internet search engine companies provide information <br>
 about information, that's all they do, yet they're the hottest thing on <br>
 Wall Street, their stock price has gone to the moon in the last year.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree that information is a thing.  I just don't think that it is a<br>
fundamental thing.<br>
 <br>
                  <br>
 &lt;&lt;Without information there would be no such definition [of fundamental],<br>
nobody around to appreciate it, and nobody to debate what has the most of<br>
it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Agreed.  After all, a definition is information, and so no information<br>
necessarily means no definitions.  But so what?<br>
                    <br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;        &gt;It seems far more plausible to me, here at the outset, that a set<br>
of         <br>
<i>         &gt;all the facts that describe X is NOT identical with X itself.  </i><br>
                    <br>
 <br>
 Perhaps, but Science is about experiment and there is no conceivable <br>
 experiment in which you could prove that to be true.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
It seems pretty difficult to conceive of any empirical experiment that would<br>
show the above to me too.  But I don't think that such experiments are the<br>
only way to prove truths, nor the only ways to discover certain kinds of<br>
truths.  I think the question of the status of information (a set of facts<br>
about a thing or just any set of concepts?) is one which must be resolved via<br>
methods other than empirical experiments.<br>
