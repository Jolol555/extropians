-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>
<p>
	Let's say James Bond and Austin Powers want to correspond about<br>
secret stuff. Obviously, they would exchange keys signed by trusted<br>
parties and go at it. However, what if there are no trusted parties, and a<br>
face to face meeting is too risky/expensive? They could each create a new<br>
key-pair not associated with their normal identities and correspond<br>
through two-way anonymous remailers, thus neither knowing whom they're<br>
talking to but at least knowing it's the same entity each time. If one of<br>
them is captured or subverted, they still won't be able to give away the<br>
identity of the other. Can anyone see any vulnerabilities in this plan<br>
whatsoever?<br>
	Now, supposing they want to bring Maxwell Smart into their<br>
organization. He joins under the same terms as they: anonymity,<br>
encryption, digital signatures on everything. Can anyone spot any<br>
vulnerabilities at this point?<br>
