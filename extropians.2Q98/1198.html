Well, lemme rephrase. :)  *You* may not have<br>
to trade value for value, but no one acts without<br>
a perceived value in doing so.  People work on <br>
Linux for various reasons, but all of them get <br>
something out of it, whether its the satisfaction<br>
of having other people know they did something,<br>
just having fun coding, or working on something<br>
for their own use.  Netscape needs to create a <br>
situation which sells server software, and so they<br>
will (if successful) sell enough servers to recoup<br>
their investment in giving away browsers.  Do you<br>
imagine that the Red Cross' volunteers don't feel<br>
that the work they do is worth doing?<br>
At any rate, I think that any system based on <br>
widespread, expensive charity will fail, and that<br>
is what I meant by the original statement. <br>
