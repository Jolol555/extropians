<p>
<p>
   IAN: Gerhard, try to honestly represent <br>
   what your opponent is saying before trashing<br>
   them personally whist entirely avoiding the <br>
   actual issue yourself. It is a lie to proclaim <br>
   that I stated that "=" means what appears on <br>
   the left is different than what appears on <br>
   the right, but that's what your saying I <br>
   said even as I posted extensively citing<br>
   the traditional usage of the "=" to mean<br>
   that what appears on the right is the <br>
   SAME AS what appears on the left.<br>
<p>
   What your saying is the same as saying <br>
   that someone who said "Don't X" said <br>
   "Do X." It is a falsehood by 100%.<br>
<p>
   What you have selected out of all that I've <br>
   presented to the list does not even say<br>
   what you wish it to say but just might out<br>
   of context as you have it. "Different con-<br>
   texts" in my sentence means that, for ex-<br>
   ample, while the color of A may = the color<br>
   of -A, the size of A may =/= the size of -A. <br>
<p>
   "Color" and "size" are the two contexts, NOT<br>
   the left and right side of the A = -A statement.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I?ve noted that you (and others) repeatedly use terms such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;?degree?,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;and ?measure? - unfortunately these terms are only valid for sets</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;where</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;these can have meaning (such as the set of Reals). For example, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;set of operators O = {+, -, *}, where O is not a Paeno set, what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;difference between {+} and {-} ? </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: That's tangential. Glad you </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   found the time to make a case that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   really has nothing to do with the topic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm betting that you don't have a clue as to what the above means ....</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: What would it matter? Your asking an <br>
  obvious question about the difference between<br>
  functions as opposed to identities. The net<br>
  difference between (+) and (-) (to answer <br>
  your question) is zero, for the inverse <br>
  of adding 5 is subtracting 5, and ex-<br>
  pressing the total displacements<br>
  as vectors yields the 0 vector.<br>
