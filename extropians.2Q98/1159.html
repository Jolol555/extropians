<i>&gt;Jesus was not black.  Neither was</i><br>
Mohammed or Krishna or Buddha or Lao<br>
<i>&gt;Tzu.  They were of their race.</i><br>
Historically of course.  Symbolically<br>
<i>&gt;they are of any race who accepts their</i><br>
doctrine.  Get this through<br>
<i>&gt;your head!</i><br>
<p>
Ouch! That hurts. Getting such<br>
certainties through one's head must<br>
surely cause some brain damage.<br>
Apparently you don't have a problem with<br>
that. Please provide a recent photo or<br>
other evidence so that the rest of the<br>
world can share your certainty that<br>
"Jesus was not black." Of course /black/<br>
does not mean literally the color of<br>
coal. Similarly, /white/, when used to<br>
describe Europeans does not mean the<br>
color of snow. Anyway, the description<br>
of Jesus (Christ, not Rodriguez, we<br>
assume) as an extropian should have<br>
clued you in that this comment had no<br>
intention of raising any heated debate.<br>
It intended nothing more Earth-shaking<br>
than a mild jest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Race has nothing to do with doctrine.</i><br>
<p>
Please tell that to the millions of<br>
racists (especially in the former<br>
Yugoslavia) who have little else,<br>
besides racism, to offer in their<br>
particular doctrines. As a Jew, J.C.<br>
came from a matrilineal race, which to<br>
this day uses its doctrine of racism to<br>
define itself. This has nothing to do<br>
with the teachings of J.C., because he<br>
(as one might hope most extropian<br>
advocates) opposed all doctrinaire<br>
attitudes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Every doctrine I've read that</i><br>
<i>&gt;was by a 'religious leader' said</i><br>
nothing about race.  It is (was)<br>
<i>&gt;always about how YOU live YOUR life.</i><br>
Racial racism is a very Bad<br>
<i>&gt;Thing when it concerns religion.  Give</i><br>
me one instance of where any<br>
<i>&gt;religious leader imposed racism in</i><br>
their doctrine.<br>
<p>
Happy to see you put the term /religious<br>
leader/ in quotes. The people listed in<br>
the previous post (Mohammed, Buddha, Lao<br>
Tzu, Krishna, Moses, and Jesus Christ),<br>
IMHO, had more in common with the<br>
tenants of extropy than with<br>
religiosity. As far as I can tell, the<br>
so-called "religious leaders" constitute<br>
the dregs of humanity who live as<br>
parasites on the words of truly<br>
enlightened masters such as those<br>
aforementioned. Give me liberty or give<br>
me death, but spare me from mixing up<br>
with the dragons of dogma and doctrine.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>

   May life provide you the opportunity<br>
to seek the ultimate truth, and may life<br>
spare you from the company of those who<br>
think they've found it.<br>
