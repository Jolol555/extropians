  IAN: Perhaps your right and the structure of <br>
  number systems is not important and thus not<br>
  worth any analytical inquiry. It baffles<br>
  me that several (perhaps most?) of the people<br>
  on the ExI list believe science is not about<br>
  truth, and defining the structure of number<br>
  systems is as useful as masturbation.!?<br>
<p>
  I recall Lee Daniel Crocker said last March:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Don't tell me that holism is /true/. I don't give</i><br>
<i>&gt;a damn. Tell me how I can /profit/ from it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: You can profit from coercion, theft, and <br>
  fraud, does that make CTF preferable to truth? <br>
  Is X good, useful, and scientific only where <br>
  it puts money in your pocket?  It seems so.<br>
  Maybe your right, maybe truth and inquiry<br>
  should just be steamrolled by greed for <br>
  that which is more profitable. :(<br>
<p>
  I believe that profits can be a consequence<br>
  of inquiry into the nature/truth of things;<br>
  but truth inquiry comes first. Animals go<br>
  out into nature looking for the useful;<br>
  do they perform science? No. Science <br>
  is the "nonuseful" asking of "Why<br>
  is the sky blue, why is..."<br>
<p>
  In the process of asking those questions <br>
  and finding their answers, lo and behold, <br>
  we discover new and useful things. The<br>
  useful is a side effect of science.<br>
<p>
  The spark of human intelligence is the <br>
  ability to look beyond the utilitarian,<br>
  to ponder the meaning, structure, and<br>
  causation of the natural world, even<br>
  if the answers don't increase profits.<br>
  This is what seperates man from maggots.<br>
