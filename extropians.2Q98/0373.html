<p>
Sounds like a good name. Yesterday I suddenly realized that I hear<br>
practically *nobody* say what they will do after the millennium, or<br>
what they think the world might be like. This is an open memetic<br>
niche: let's present our idea of a transhuman renaissance as the<br>
logical theme of the next century.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Certainly many Transhumans could, or do, consider themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Renaissance entities."</i><br>
<p>
I certainly do. I might not be a complete renaissance man yet, but I'm<br>
definitely working in that direction and think it is an useful<br>
personal goal. Why settle for anything less? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree that intellect and imagination must be reintigrated. How do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you propose that these two differening (but both useful) ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt; perceiving (science and art) the universe be reintegrated?</i><br>
<p>
I think the main problem is 1) a lack of understanding of each other,<br>
2) a feeling they can't be combined (due to 1?). Today there are huge<br>
deficits in education, creating people who doesn't know anything about<br>
science and/or art (the worst thing is that there are a lot of people<br>
in the 'and' group). We better find ways of motivating people to learn<br>
more and more broadly.<br>
<p>
As for 2, I find it rather revealing that at my research group (around<br>
10 people) there are one guitarrist in a rock band, one synth player,<br>
one organist and one professional pianist - at least among<br>
computational neuroscientists there are artistic people - but they all<br>
seem to be creating music in its traditional form (rock, church music,<br>
modern classical music), not trying to combine their science with the<br>
art. There seems to be a kind of taboo here, that one shouldn't put<br>
science into art or art into science. I would like to see art that<br>
express science and science that express art. This is why I look<br>
forward to the Cajal space mission - Cajal showed that science can be<br>
art.<br>
<p>
I really hope I can turn some of my research into art one day. <br>
