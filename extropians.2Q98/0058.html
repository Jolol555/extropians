In a message dated 98-04-02 13:16:37 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Finally, Graham Hancock ties all this together in his book (though it was<br>
written first), "Fingerprints of the Gods" which has interesting discourse on<br>
various subjects. Hancock asserts that there was a civilization in existence<br>
some 10,000+ years ago with fairly advanced technolody (not Atlantis type<br>
stuff but close to it. By the way, Hancock also thinks Atlantis is hidden<br>
beneath the Antarctic ice sheets).<br>

<p>
Remember they've recently found evidence of water travel 800,000 years ago!  <br>
<p>
Ive always thought this about Antarctica, because there is evidence of forests<br>
underneath, but recently i found out that they're over a million years old, is<br>
there any new information on this?<br>
<p>
Also, they've recently found a room underneath the Sphinx, but havent opened<br>
it yet.<br>
