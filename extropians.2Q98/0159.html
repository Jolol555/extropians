Sorry, I can’t quote the previous material in this thread because I<br>
accidentally deleted the file and am having no luck finding anything<br>
in the archives (it was scrambled, now there’s just no content.)<br>
<p>
So here we go…<br>
<p>
Here’s my original model for a decentralised market:<br>
<p>
Each person contributes to a virtual ‘pool’ of resources across a<br>
distributed network.  Every resource that is added can be replicated<br>
by any other member of the network for their own individual needs at<br>
no cost to the other members.  There is no direct trading between any<br>
members of the network (even person to person.)  You do not have to<br>
contribute to be able to take, and there is no points or reward system.<br>
<p>
Currently this would only work with information (because it can be<br>
easily replicated), but it can be applied to all resources (nobody<br>
said we have to keep this in the realm of the possible.)<br>
<p>
I submit that this is more decentralised than the Free Market, and<br>
therefore the Free Market is not completely decentralised.<br>
