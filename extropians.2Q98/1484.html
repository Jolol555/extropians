It seems clear to me that the Novikov table could not exist and be<br>
consistent with free will.  (BTW do you have a reference to Novikov's<br>
paper?)  It's the classic paradox.  You watch the hole, and when<br>
nothing comes out, you throw a ball in.  Oops, it was supposed to have<br>
come out one second ago.  What happened?<br>
<p>
Obviously you will not succeed in throwing the ball into the hole.<br>
Maybe you'll have a heart attack when you try, or maybe a random<br>
fluctuation of air molecules will bat the ball away at the last<br>
minute.  It's Asimov's story all over again.<br>
<p>
A few years ago it was thought that wormhole paradoxes would be<br>
prevented because, at least in some geometries, virtual particles could<br>
take a closed timelike path.  This led to an infinite amplification of<br>
the particle flux, choking off the wormhole.<br>
<p>
However I understand that these results did not generalize and that it<br>
is now thought that no physical phenomenon will prevent the paradoxes.<br>
I still suspect that some variation on the virtual particle problem<br>
will arise and prevent wormhole loops, but it remains to be seen.<br>
