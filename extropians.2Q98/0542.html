It's not such a bad word -:)  And, it doesn't really take away from<br>
creative thinking.  Wouldn't it be better to be creative in a rational way,<br>
than in an irrational manner?<br>

Perhaps this is the upside of the posthuman.  Whether or not we hit a<br>
Singularity, we will hit a Creativity Augmentum where creativity will be<br>
much in demand at a period when we have not only the time, but the<br>
brain-power to create.  The leaps in our creativity will be manifold.  Will<br>
it be rational?  If we are rational beings, our creativity is rational.  <br>
