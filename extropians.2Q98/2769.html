I believe in the case of grand juries (Clinton's follies aside) that <br>
one may be jailed for contempt of court for refusing to testify - <br>
also in the case of some congressional investigations. Perhaps I am <br>
wrong in this opinion, but seem to remember hearing about someone <br>
getting canned for trying to take the '5th'.<br>
<p>
I know that countless lowlifes and criminals have relied on the 5th <br>
Amendment to avoid further charges, but the general feeling for the <br>
last few decades is that anyone taking the 5th is automatically <br>
guilty, or they would have no problem talking.<br>
<p>
Actually, I have not followed the mess in the White House too <br>
closely. I care not who he is in bed with - as long as he is <br>
following the Constitution and doing his job otherwise.<br>
