&lt;&lt; While operating a crane, a forklift, or a tractor trailer may not be as<br>
unskilled<br>
 posistions as a ditch digger, the fact is that a reasonably well trained<br>
 individual can pretty much master the job requirements in 6 weeks of<br>
training.<br>
 (Forklift training actually takes one day, but I'll be generous). &gt;&gt;<br>

Not meaning to detract from your overall point Mike...with which I agree<br>
...but....<br>
<p>
I've done two of the above....(forklift and tractor trailer)...and must<br>
confess that it does take only a short time to learn the rudiments.<br>
<p>
Like it only takes a few minutes to learn how to ride a horse....right?<br>
<p>
I mean...how difficult is it?  You just sit up there in the saddle...hold the<br>
reins...use your knees ever now and then...and everything is peachy keen?<br>
<p>
Obviously that is nonsense....as is the idea that you can be a skilled tractor<br>
trailer operator in such a short period of time.  Consider why the major<br>
carriers (non union) pay so much more for experience....  <br>
<p>
Greater experience means greater productivity...less wear and tear on the<br>
equipment...and fewer accidents...<br>
<p>
And as far a CRANE!!  &lt;shudder&gt;<br>
