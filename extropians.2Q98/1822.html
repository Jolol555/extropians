Where does this reasoning leave trade secrets? If they become public<br>
knowledge via theft, under your reasoning, there's no recourse unless you<br>
catch the thief in the act?<br>

The information in a patent is freely available to anyone who wishes to see<br>
it. The nominal fee the patent office charges is for filing and<br>
reproduction. The right to build PRECISELY what the patent describes is all<br>
that is owned by the patent holder. All others are welcome to use the<br>
information to make a better product, or to make the original patented<br>
thing obsolete, if they wish. They are just not free to reap the benefits<br>
of someone else's hard work in developing the original product, for a<br>
period of time that should be long enough for the inventor to recoup his<br>
initial expenses and most likely for the whole idea to become painfully<br>
passe..<br>
<p>
Obviously, there are people and businesses out there who abuse the patent<br>
system, such as the guy who had an 'idea' for the microprocessor, but never<br>
did any actual development. Later, when others had independently invented<br>
the thing, he came back and fought for a patent on the grounds that it was<br>
'his idea'. I believe he won..<br>
<p>
A local electrical engineer here has made a career of patenting any and all<br>
schemes related to discharge lighting such as metal halide, florescent, and<br>
neon, and electronic ballasts. Numerous times a cursory search of the<br>
Motorola data books from ten and twenty years back will find the identical<br>
circuit he has received a patent on last week.<br>
<p>
Instead of scrapping the whole system and the protections given to prevent<br>
a real inventor's ideas from being stolen by those with the bucks to outgun<br>
him, why don't we think of ways to correct the flaws in the present patent<br>
and trademark laws? Perhaps a return to the 'working prototype' concept<br>
would suffice - if you can't build a working model of what you propose,<br>
it's either not well enough thought out to be a real invention, or it's<br>
unpatentable because it does not work.<br>
