<i>&gt; your own firm. Therefore you are forces to earn wage your hole life. &lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry, but the three people I named (among a great many others --</i><br>
<i>&gt; some of whom immigrated to the United States, not speaking English,</i><br>
<i>&gt; possessing only those resources they were able to keep while fleeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; through the jungle or accumulate during years in refugee camps --</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can't get much poorer than that) did precisely what you</i><br>
<i>&gt; say cannot be done.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe you didn't recognise the names, though.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ray Kroc was a milkshake-making-machine salesman and repairman, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; from that start he created the McDonald's chain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rich deVoss was a door-to-door soap salesman.  He owns half of Amway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sam Walton sold various supplies to small-town general stores.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; created the WalMart chain. &lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a new factor that isn't acknowledged in your argument above,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that is that our confiscatory tax system has grown immeasurably</i><br>
<i>&gt; MORE confiscatory since the above gentleman were able to make their</i><br>
<i>&gt; fortunes.  In other words, it is much more difficult nowadays, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; greatly increased gov't taxation on our incomes and everything else</i><br>
<i>&gt; within sight, to save enough to go into one's own business.  </i><br>
<p>
This would be relevant if the person originating this were arguing <br>
against government.  In fact, he was arguing against capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In addition, inflation by the Federal Reserve has eaten away the value</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our money, drastically.  Just compare prices for a commodity from,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, the 50s to their present prices, and you will see just how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; purchasing power the dollar has lost.  </i><br>
<p>
Holding significant savings primarily in currency-denominated assets <br>
has not been wise for a very long time.  Inflation should have no <br>
effect on the rate of savings; it should merely move those savings <br>
even more toward equity as opposed to currency-denominated assets.<br>
<p>
Inflation will not affect a person's ability to transform equity <br>
assets into a self-owned business.  In fact, if the market perfectly <br>
anticipated and allowed for inflation (it's never PERFECT -- merely <br>
better than any real-world-credible alternative we've thought of <br>
yet), inflation would have absolutely no effect on that person's <br>
ability to borrow money to help start the business -- and later repay <br>
the loan.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; These facts would make the gentleman's argument more true than false,</i><br>
<i>&gt; IMO.</i><br>
<p>
Your opinion is mistaken, partially because these "facts" are as much <br>
conclusion as fact, and the conclusion is wrong; and partially <br>
because the actual facts you cite constitute an argument AGAINST his <br>
position.<br>
