Very interesting.  Of course I have not had the privilege to read 'The Spike'<br>
yet.  I did however find your comments given at the STAVCON 97' to be the most<br>
poignant of them all.  I found this particular passage of yours to be<br>
questionable:<br>
<p>
"Artists like me will do what we can to shape our understanding of the changing<br>
realities about us, to catch its frenzy on the ends of our nervy tendrils.<br>
<p>
But poets are no longer the unacknowledged legislators of mankind, if they ever<br>
were. No, that role has passed to those who dwell in what C. P. Snow so long<br>
ago called the Second Culture."<br>
<p>
What of the Third Culture - the cross-pollination of the two?  If wasn't for<br>
the vision of 'poets' such as yourself and other sci-fi authors, many of the<br>
pioneers in modern science would not have pursued their chosen careers.<br>
Wouldn't you say that poetry, art and literature helps provide a context, a<br>
navigation map, a passion, a *direction* in which to steer this rocketship we<br>
call technology?<br>
<p>
Hopefully Natasha is reading this and can add her own input on the importance<br>
of art in an extropian future.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
