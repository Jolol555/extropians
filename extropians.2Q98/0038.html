<p>
Obviously.<br>
	<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;What would stop someone like Bill Gates from  doing what he will </i><br>
<i>	&gt;with 10000000 Indians?  </i><br>
	<br>
<p>
The fact that 10000000 Indians have more money willing to be spent on matters <br>
concerning the life and death of 10000000 Indians than Bill Gates does.<br>
		  <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Not to mention that most people's wieldable money (spare money?) is </i><br>
<i>	&gt;much less than 2% of a rich person's spare money.  </i><br>
		  <br>
<p>
It's not you against the world, no viable PPA would have only one member, and <br>
if you need money to prevent you from being hanged tomorrow morning then your <br>
spare money is 100% of your total net worth.<br>
		  <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Also, what's the difference between a large PPA and a standard </i><br>
<i>	&gt;nation state, in which you pay taxes to be protected?  </i><br>
		  <br>
<p>
Unlike a government a PPA  will not force you to join or pay them one dime  <br>
because it does not claim rights an individual does not have. If I need money  <br>
I don't claim the right to take it from you regardless of your wishes. <br>
Government does.<br>
		  <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;What will protect you from your own PPA?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Possibly nothing, one PPA might become  far more powerful than any other,  <br>
turn psychotic and take over everything. It could happen, but it's much less  <br>
likely than the US Army doing it and setting up a military dictatorship, <br>
and they certainly have the power to do so if they wanted. At the first signs <br>
of totalitarian behavior in a PPA, people could simply stop doing business <br>
with it and switch to a competitor, this would cut off its lifeblood, money. <br>
Remember, doing business with a PPA is voluntary and that gives enormous  <br>
power to people, a power that citizens forced to finance the army and police  <br>
regardless of their opinion of it do not have. Also, just like now, PPA's in<br>
a world without government would attract people who enjoy exercising control <br>
over other people, but unlike the police and army of today, it would also <br>
attract people who enjoy making money. Those kind of people are much safer to <br>
have in positions of power.                     <br>
