<i>&gt; In our case, I would argue that the fault is not the market. Partly it</i><br>

and<br>

<i>&gt; educational system that is weak at motivating students, lacks innovation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and fails to instill important skills. (I *know* this goes on because I</i><br>
<i>&gt; teach students entering college who almost all lack logical skills, basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; math, and any semblance of scientific education.) Schools in this country</i><br>
<i>&gt; are almost entirely run by the state. The state, not the market.</i><br>
Introduce<br>
<i>&gt; market discipline and I predict that things would improve dramatically.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe we'll see: One state has recently begun to use the voucher system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is an important step towards a market system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So, once again, the market is blamed for the deficiences of statism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure this is so. The reason the state has historically taken<br>
responsibilty<br>
for the education of the vast majority of its population is because<br>
Governemnts<br>
recognised that a growing Capitalist economy had to be able to access a<br>
much<br>
larger pool of educated and skilled labour than the previously ruling and<br>
upper <br>
middle class education systems were able or willing to provide beyond a few<br>
<p>
scholarships. Market oriented Education systems seem to quickly degenerate<br>
into<br>
elitist education for the wealthy and no education at all for the poorest,<br>
Brazil for<br>
example.<br>
<p>
 The voucher system that the  new Labour government have introduced<br>
in Britain is actually a step away from the market system. The market was<br>
only<br>
providing Nursery places for wealthier parents, wheras parents of 4 year<br>
olds who <br>
were trying to hold down jobs with meagre incomes had to rely on cheap day<br>
care<br>
and unlicensed child minders, these have now been given Vouchers worth<br>
about <br>
1500 pounds that can only be used to pay for a nursery school place. The<br>
government<br>
hope that Nurseries will be created by the market to soak up this financial<br>
glut. I<br>
don't think handing people cheques and ordering them to spend the money on<br>
something<br>
that doesn't even  exist yet has anything to do with free market economics.<br>
<p>
If a child is not receiving an education, we are all to blame.<br>
