Title<br>
  Dietary flaxseed supplementation and experimental metastasis<br>
  of melanoma cells in mice.<br>

Abstract<br>
  The present study investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of<br>
  flaxseed, the richest source of lignans, on experimental<br>
  metastasis of B16BL6 murine melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were fed a<br>
  basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 2.5, 5 or 10%<br>
  flaxseed for 2 weeks before and after the intravenous<br>
  injection of 0.75 x 10(5) melanoma cells. At necropsy, the number of tumors<br>
  that developed in the lungs was counted, the cross-sectional area of tumors<br>
  was measured and the volumes of tumors were calculated. The median number of<br>
  tumors in mice fed the 2.5, 5 and 10% flaxseed-supplemented<br>
  diets was 32, 54 and 63% lower than that of the controls, respectively. The<br>
  addition of flaxseed to the diet also caused a<br>
  dose-dependent decrease in the tumor cross-sectional area and the tumor<br>
  volume. These results provide the first experimental evidence that<br>
  flaxseed reduces metastasis and inhibits the growth of the<br>
  metastatic secondary tumors in animals. It is concluded that<br>
  flaxseed may be a useful nutritional adjuvant to prevent<br>
  metastasis in cancer patients.<br>
