I agree here, assuming access to the internet gets sufficiently cheap and complex web site administration doesn't require the rigorous<br>
training it does now.  I just can't imagine the typical back teller learning the ins and outs of HTML, CGI, PERL and/or SQL. It must<br>
become simpler to implement.  Then we could see a full-scale Bazaar on our hands!  That would be fun!<br>
