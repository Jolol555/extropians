<i>&gt; &gt;Only rich people are allowed to bring their inventions to market.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;A poor person cannot bring his own invention to market, because he </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;doesn't have the money -- and he also can't pay up if his invention </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;doesn't work out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If inventing is expensive, then we should expect this.  It's how the market</i><br>
<i>&gt; rations goods.</i><br>
<p>
But, often, inventing is NOT expensive.  Inventing occurs inside a <br>
person's head; developing the invention can be cheap or expensive, <br>
depending on the components involved.  Many fabulous inventions <br>
consisted simply of putting readily-available parts together in a way <br>
nobody had thought of before.<br>
<p>
Perfecting the invention and bringing it to market, is expensive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Besides, oftentimes even a basic description of an invention is </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sufficient to reinvent it.  For example, try to describe a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Frisbee(tm) well enough to garner interest, but *not* well enough </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that a toy manufacturer could reinvent it himself just from your </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;description. </i><br>

<i>&gt; "It's a disk that flies."  "How?"  "I'm not telling."</i><br>
<p>
"Go away."<br>
<p>
"Tech staff?  Make me a disk that flies.  What size?  It's a toy.  <br>
How does it fly?  Look around.  Toy engines with enough power are <br>
complicated and a tiny niche hobby, this is supposedly going to be <br>
hot.  So try throwing it."<br>
<p>
"Boss, last night my wife knocked a bunch of plastic lids off a <br>
shelf.  She tried to catch them, but of course missed most of them.  <br>
Some of them flew a couple yards."  "OK, work with that."<br>
