Extending health span with genetics<br>
<p>
Fruit fly find suggests approaches for keeping youthful vigor<br>
<p>
By Charlene Laino<br>
MSNBC<br>
<p>
June 1 Canadian scientists reported Monday that they have<br>
successfully extended the life span of the fruit fly by inserting<br>
into its DNA a designer gene that prevented some of the cellular<br>
damage normally associated with aging. The approach holds potential<br>
for increasing humans health span our days of youthful vigor, said<br>
researcher John Phillips of the University of Guelph.<br>
<p>
USING GENETIC ENGINEERING techniques, an extra gene was inserted<br>
into the fruit flys motor neurons  nerve cells that control<br>
movement  boosting their ability to remove toxins from the body and<br>
extending their life span by 40 percent.<br>
<p>
       While an extra 30 days added to the normal 80-day life span<br>
of a fruit fly might sound insignificant, the find has enormous<br>
implications for biology, Phillips said.<br>
 <br>
We have discovered that [weakening of the detoxifying mechanism] in<br>
motor neurons is the Achilles heel of life span, the Canadian<br>
scientist said.<br>
 <br>
 Drug companies are already working on new pharmaceuticals targeted<br>
at the motor neurons that would work to increase our health span,<br>
he noted. But perhaps even more importantly, the findings mark the<br>
first time researchers have shown that a single gene in a single<br>
type of cell can affect longevity.<br>
<p>
 We were really surprised, said study head Gabrielle Boulianne, a<br>
neurobiologist at the Hospital for Sick Children and a professor of<br>
molecular and medical genetics at the University of Toronto. We now<br>
know that just manipulating just one gene, targeting one type of<br>
cell, has a huge impact on aging.<br>
<p>
 Contrary to what was previously thought  that many different<br>
factors contribute to aging  it now appears that the process may be<br>
simpler, Boulianne said. The study is published in the June issue<br>
of the journal Nature Genetics.<br>
<p>
 The new research grew out of work showing that the efficiency with<br>
which organisms use oxygen directly correlates to their life span,<br>
Phillips said. Humans, who have the longest lives of any organism,<br>
are the most efficient users of oxygen, for example, while mice and<br>
hummingbirds, who have relatively short lives, are inefficient<br>
users.<br>
<p>
 The reason, he said, is that oxygen is very toxic. Even at the 21<br>
percent atmospheric oxygen that we breathe, there has evolved a<br>
detoxifying mechanism without which we would all keel over and die,<br>
Phillips explained.<br>
<p>
 Over the past decade, scientists have identified the genes<br>
responsible for this detoxifying mechanism. When this gene is made<br>
inactive via a human-made mutation in the fruit fly, Phillips said,<br>
its life span is reduced by some 80 percent to 90 percent.<br>
       <br>
 At about the same time, researchers came to better understand that<br>
motor neurons are somehow associated with this detoxifying<br>
mechanism. Studies have shown that people with Lou Gehrigs disease,<br>
a paralytic disorder that is caused by a loss of motor neurons,<br>
tend to have family members whose genes controlling oxygen<br>
detoxification are faulty, for example.<br>
<p>
 Moreover, in species ranging fruit flies to humans, there is<br>
evidence that loss of motor neuron function is a prominent feature<br>
of disease, aging and death, molecular biologist Phillips said. We<br>
theorized that motor neurons might be at the nexus of aging and<br>
oxygen metabolism.<br>
<p>
 That research led to the question: What would happen if we<br>
upgraded that detoxification defense mechanism? Would the organism<br>
live longer?<br>
<p>
 To answer the question, the team created a designer gene that<br>
would enhance oxygen detoxification in motor neurons. The<br>
human-made gene was then added to the fruit flys normal genetic<br>
makeup. The experiment worked. Not only did the gene help the motor<br>
neurons eliminate more waste, but the fruit flies they lived<br>
longer.<br>
<p>
 Drug companies are already working on new antioxidant formulas<br>
targeted at the motor neurons that work more efficiently in the<br>
nervous system to rid our bodies of toxins and increase our health<br>
span, Phillips said.<br>
<p>
 While some theorize that the approach could be used to create a<br>
pill that would let us all live 40 percent longer  boosting average<br>
age from 80 to 110  Phillips said that is not his intention. There<br>
are too many social implications, he said. Already there are<br>
problems with old-age pensions, for example.<br>
<p>
 Rather, the find can be used to help us live healthier, avoiding<br>
the sickness and disease normally associated with old age, he said.<br>
The way in which the approach extended the life span of the fruit<br>
fly is encouraging, Phillips said. Life span was extended though<br>
postponement of the onset of senescence. In other words, he said,<br>
we could live our final days not in a geriatric ward, but full of<br>
youthful energy.<br>
