Here's an abstract (from the Journal of Scientific Exploration) of the<br>
experiment I found ESPecially charming in Dean Radin's book THE CONSCIOUS<br>

Is consciousness limited to perception of the sensory present and memory of<br>
the past, or does it also have access to future information? In an<br>
experiment designed to explore this question, a computer was used to<br>
randomly select and present target photos from a pool of digitized<br>
photographs. Some targets labeled "calm" included landscapes and cheerful<br>
people; other targets labeled "extreme" included violent and erotic topics.<br>
Heart rate, blood volume, and electrodermal activity were recorded before,<br>
during and after presentation of the target photo to see whether the body<br>
would unconsciously respond differentially to the two types of future<br>
targets. Extreme targets were expected to produce classical orienting<br>
responses after the targets were displayed, and a "presentiment" (future<br>
feeling) effect was predicted to produce orienting pre-sponses before the<br>
pictures were displayed. Calm targets were expected to cause no unusual<br>
responses before or after the target was displayed. Four experiments,<br>
involving 31 participants who viewed a total of 1,060 target photos, showed<br>
the expected orienting response after the target photo was displayed. In<br>
accordance with a presentiment hypothesis, there was a clear orienting<br>
pre-sponse that peaked with a four standard error difference in<br>
physiological measures between extreme and calm targets one second before<br>
the target photo was displayed.  <br>
