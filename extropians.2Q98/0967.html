<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If everyone can instantly communicate and trade templates, there would be no</i><br>
<i>&gt;market for transportation as we know it, and large factories would become</i><br>
<i>&gt;obsolete.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see huge resistance to the start of this system from existing corporations</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comments?</i><br>
<p>
I have a couple comments.<br>
<p>
1) I don't want to rehash an old topic, but you are demonstrating a lack of<br>
understanding as to the function and legal ramifications of corporations.<br>
The power, impunity, and immunity of corporations is popular myth,<br>
generally set forth by people who do not understand the corporate legal<br>
structure.<br>
<p>
2) Your model economy does not make a corporation non-competitive.<br>
Templates are essentially software.  Companies that spend a lot of time<br>
designing and marketing useful templates will be able to make plenty of<br>
money.  The only thing that may change is the definition of money.  In this<br>
free replication scenario, I would expect intellectual property, like<br>
Templates, to be the medium of exchange.  Generating original Templates<br>
would be roughly equivalent to minting your own money.<br>
<p>
Also, depending on how far things go, raw mass may also become a commodity<br>
of finite value.  However, I would expect mass consumption to be balanced<br>
by the ability to obtain more mass through application of your replication<br>
technology.  I will assume moving mass will be accomplished via your<br>
infinite energy source.<br>
