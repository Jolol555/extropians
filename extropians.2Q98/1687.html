Can you imagine that real science has no<br>
use for ethics, because real science<br>
tests itself with its own record of<br>
accuracy... its ability to precisely<br>
predict events. Science does not hope.<br>
Science intends to know.<br>
<p>
Obviously, science does not exist<br>
separately from brains. But what if it<br>
did?<br>
"If science could talk,<br>
it would whisper in song<br>
like a morning breeze.<br>
If science could touch<br>
it would splash sweet lotion<br>
upon my flesh and bones,<br>
and the stream of it<br>
would soothe, refresh and delight.<br>
If science could see,<br>
it would behold immense<br>
and timeless reveries inside of me<br>
within a heartbeat<br>
sturdy as earth and sea,<br>
and delicate as starlight<br>
reflected in a misty eye.<br>
The scientist's brain remembers shadows<br>
of the would-be-nows<br>
in feather-years of stillness<br>
and dismay.<br>
The scientist's brain knows silence<br>
of the will-be-thens<br>
in vaulted unknown spaces<br>
of the bending land.<br>
The scientist's brain knows suchness;<br>
the stretching fibers<br>
of a textured body singing<br>
the ecstasy of light.<br>
O passion of the quest for truth,<br>
revealing science without end."<br>

"Utility first"? Nay, first find the<br>
science that can free you from every<br>
sort of  teleology.<br>
<p>
"ethics first"? Absurd to demarcate good<br>
from bad until you know the point of<br>
doing so.<br>
<p>
"At last you find the truth, the place<br>
where you began, and recognize it for<br>
the first time." --Some Smartguy<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"truth first" ethic instills a standard</i><br>
of ethics:<br>
<i>&gt;a principle which the individual must</i><br>
subordinate<br>
<i>&gt;him/herself for "the greater good,"</i><br>
which, lets<br>
<i>&gt;face it, is a defining principle of any</i><br>
com-<br>
<i>&gt;minity, that I will agree to abide by a</i><br>
<i>&gt;set of rules that includes your rights.</i><br>
<p>
My own life teaches me that individuals<br>
subordinate themselves to community<br>
standards for entirely selfish reasons.<br>
The myth of altruism persists, I<br>
suppose, because it assuages the<br>
cognitive dissonance of pointless<br>
self-sacrifice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think that Daniel is correct to</i><br>
observe the<br>
<i>&gt;utilitarian aspect of a truth-first</i><br>
principle,<br>
<i>&gt;but this aspect is just as well as</i><br>
saying,<br>
<i>&gt;"Utility dictates that some other</i><br>
standard<br>
<i>&gt;than utility be the prime directive."</i><br>
<p>
Not quite. The usefulness of truth<br>
coincides with its ability to provide<br>
value to its adherents. For example: a<br>
company that engages in fraudulant<br>
testing practices knows that it has done<br>
so. Such a company must nevertheless<br>
acknowledge the truth of the matter by<br>
diligently concealing the fraud.<br>
<p>
One might suggest as a "prime directive"<br>
the selection of a useful truth over a<br>
useless one. In this case, it appears<br>
somewhat unethical to try to identify<br>
either truth or utility as prime<br>
directives because we've just identified<br>
reason as the prime directive. If it<br>
appears unreasonable to do otherwise,<br>
then we have our proof as well.  --JRM<br>
