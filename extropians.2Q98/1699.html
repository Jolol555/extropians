This is off the thread, but was WWII caused by the murders, or by Hitler's<br>
expansionism? I always thought it was the latter, as most histories I have<br>
read show that world acknowledgement of the death camps came late in the<br>
war, when Allied troops liberated some of them. Before the graphic truth<br>
was shown on newsreels, the war was mainly about repelling invaders from<br>
Germany who were bent on conquering the world.<br>
<p>
If Hitler had stayed home and set up death camps, would the world community<br>
of the day have stepped in to do something about it? After all, he would<br>
not have been directly affecting any other nation's borders or peoples.<br>
