Well put. The poorest people in America now are living better than the<br>
poorest people of 100 years ago. This is in a material sense and as relates<br>
to healthcare, nutrition, etc.<br>
<p>
I think that there's a different level of poverty that is growing in our<br>
society. Spiritual or mental poverty appears to be on the rise. The worst<br>
cases I have heard of are in the CHA's high rise slums in Chicago. These<br>
places tend to collect the most impoverished people the world has ever<br>
seen. They have heat, electricity, plumbing, TVs, phones, mail service,<br>
public education, elevators (when they work), cars, public transportation,<br>
free medical clinics, and welfare payments.<br>
<p>
These 'new poor' do not have hope, or respect, in many cases no self<br>
respect. They tend to become criminals and addicts at high rates.<br>
<p>
I don't believe this rise in 'poverty' has anything to do with wealth and<br>
its' distribution. I think it has everything to do with the way our<br>
government has handled traditional poverty. The 'war on some drugs' is a<br>
prime candidate for blame here, as is the welfare system.<br>
