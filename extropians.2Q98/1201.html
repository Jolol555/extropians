<p>
No, there is a distinct difference.  Consider it in terms of economic<br>
supply and demand curves.  The very first copy of a book is quite expensive<br>
to produce, but subsequent copies are quite cheap.  The first copy of a<br>
book requires time, creative energy and artistic skill, whereas subsequent<br>
copies can be produced in bulk and require considerably less innovation.<br>
And perhaps most important of all, the artist very rarely actually DOES any<br>
of the work involved in making copies of the book; this is a job best left<br>
to printers.<br>
<p>
We should expect, then, that the artist should be paid for the services<br>
rendered, for creating the very first copy of the book, because THAT copy<br>
actually required the artist's services.  Art by commission is one such<br>
example of an artist being paid for creating art, rather than for producing<br>
copies of art.  Auctioning the first copy to the highest bidder would be<br>
another strategy.<br>
<p>
However, once multiple people have a copy, the artist and anyone else who<br>
has a copy of the book fall into nearly perfect competition.  If the artist<br>
offers a higher price for a copy of the book than anyone else, there is no<br>
reason to buy from the artist; other copies are perfect substitutes.  Since<br>
we're in nearly perfect competition, the market price for the book should<br>
be no greater than the marginal cost, the cost to make one more book.  This<br>
cost, of course, is no  greater than the cost of printing.<br>
<p>
Since an individual copy of a book costs almost nothing when it is in the<br>
hands of many, but costs much more when it is only in the hands of the<br>
artist, then it seems reasonable that the artist should make a profit<br>
EARLY, when the book is being created, rather than later, when the book is<br>
being printed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; as the human spirit of creativity</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is released from the bonds of labor, free to create and influence</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; all other industries toward an even higher standard of living,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; more art, more writing, and more software.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A thousand years ago, every artist was directly rewarded by the </i><br>
<i>&gt;people whom he directly delivered his art to, but could do nothing </i><br>
<i>&gt;about copying and could not do any form of indirect delivery.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Today, some artists sell their art to people who choose to make it </i><br>
<i>&gt;freely available, while others receive indirect payment from each </i><br>
<i>&gt;individual consumer -- who also receives the art indirectly.  Only a </i><br>
<i>&gt;tiny fraction of art revenues are related to art delivered directly </i><br>
<i>&gt;from artist to consumer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A thousand years ago, only a tiny fraction of households contained </i><br>
<i>&gt;any art whatsoever that wasn't made by its residents.  Today, nearly </i><br>
<i>&gt;every home does.</i><br>
<p>
A thousand years ago, people were much much poorer than they are today.  So<br>
the fact that there was very little art around, which has always been<br>
classified as a luxury, surprises me not a bit.<br>
<p>
Also, it's important that we separate the supply of NEW art and the supply<br>
of COPIES of art.  While we might conceivably see a contraction in the<br>
supply of new art as a result of the elimination of intellectual copyright,<br>
the supply of copies of art would expand dramatically, as they would only<br>
cost as much as it costs to reproduce the art.  We should expect to see<br>
LESS art in people's homes under copyright, not more.<br>
<p>
With intellectual copyright, we get more new art, at a lower price than it<br>
is worth, and fewer copies, at a higher price than they are worth.  Without<br>
intellectual copyright, we get less new art, at the high price it deserves,<br>
and more copies, at the low price they are worth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Eliminate copyrights and patents, and indirect payment ceases to </i><br>
<i>&gt;exist; so the artists who live off that indirect payment -- the large </i><br>
<i>&gt;majority of those who can live off their art at all -- must turn to </i><br>
<i>&gt;other fields.  They will produce less art, or no art at all.</i><br>
<p>
Less art, but at a higher price, thanks to auctioning/commision.  It is not<br>
clear, then, that the artists' revenues will contract.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How does driving artists away from art and into other fields, produce </i><br>
<i>&gt;more art?</i><br>
<p>
See above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a substantial difference between being protected from </i><br>
<i>&gt;looters who want to receive the benefit of your work without paying </i><br>
<i>&gt;you (the writer as described), and being protected *by* looters who </i><br>
<i>&gt;compel others to pay you without receiving the benefit of your work </i><br>
<i>&gt;(the farmer as described).</i><br>
<p>
Poor example.  How about this one:  The aviation industry, having a hard<br>
time cartelizing, convinced the government to do it for them, setting up<br>
the Civil Aeronautics Administration in 1938.  (Later to become the Civil<br>
Aeronautics Board, CAB.)  Until deregulation in the 70s, it was allowed to<br>
set interstate airline rates and prevent new interstate airlines from<br>
forming.  By setting a minimum price which no member of the cartel could<br>
legally break and by preventing new airlines from forming, the cartel had a<br>
coerced monopoly over interstate aviation.<br>
<p>
Were passengers receiving the benefit of interstate transportation?<br>
Obviously.  Were they paying a fair rate for this benefit?  No, absolutely<br>
not.<br>
<p>
In this case, by not allowing new companies to make copies, the artist<br>
gains a coerced monopoly over book copies; as a result, the artist can set<br>
a much higher price than the copies are actually worth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The novel-writer simply wants to be paid by the novel-reader.</i><br>
<p>
The novel-reader is not buying the work of the novel-writer.  The<br>
novel-reader is receiving the work of the novel-printer.<br>
<p>
Think of it this way:  the novel writer is making the mold from which<br>
millions of cheap statues can be formed.  Since this is true, the writer<br>
should be paid for the mold, not for the statues.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If the </i><br>
<i>&gt;reader chooses to not read that novel, its author expects no payment. </i><br>
<i>&gt; But novel-writers who receive no payment and have no reason to </i><br>
<i>&gt;expect any payment in the future, tend to stop writing novels.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Without copyrights, there would be no expectation of payment.</i><br>
<p>
Again, the writer CAN expect payment.  The author can write by commission,<br>
or auction the work to the highest bidder.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And while I am sure we all agree that 90% of all art produced today </i><br>
<i>&gt;is crap, we don't necessarily agree on *which* 90%.</i><br>
<p>
That's why we let the market decide.<br>
<p>
Actually, this is the best reason of all to abandon intellectual property.<br>
90% of what's written today is crap because authors don't bear the full<br>
cost of a failed writing enterprise.  If authors DID bear this cost, we<br>
might see the supply of new novels contract while the quality increases,<br>
just as we see in investment when we pull out the safety nets.  Meanwhile,<br>
more copies of those novels which have been produced can be sold cheaply<br>
and to a wider audience.  <br>
<p>
So in conclusion, we get more copies of fewer but better novels without<br>
copyright, and fewer copies of more but worse novels with copyright.<br>
<p>
Care to try this again?<br>
