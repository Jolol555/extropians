I was raised a "strict" protestent.  When I was a child I looked with envy at<br>
the Southern Baptists because or their relative freedom...they could have<br>
"fun".<br>
<p>
So I can relate to what you just said here.  It always seemed a little screwy<br>
to me.   Many things were internally inconsistent.  Even though there were<br>
looooooong and boring sunday morning sermons devoted to pushing the party<br>
line.<br>
<p>
I'd be (very...very mildly ) curious as to some readings on the "forbidden"<br>
texts you allude to.  An overview perhaps?  I'm not into relegion<br>
anymore...except as it relates to meme infection and how to avoid it.<br>
