Largest-ever survey of the heavens about to begin <br>
<p>

SAN DIEGO (June 8, 1998 10:50 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) -- The most<br>
ambitious mapping of the heavens ever undertaken is about to start from a<br>
remote observatory in New Mexico, using the most complex camera ever built. <br>
The $77 million project, called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, will probe 40<br>
times farther into the universe than any earlier survey, taking pictures in<br>
three dimensions and in five colors, astronomers announced here Monday. <br>
When the survey is complete, it will provide an atlas of the skies 100 times<br>
clearer than the star charts relied upon for decades and will have pinpointed<br>
the location of more than 100 million galaxies. <br>
Yet, the survey will produce images that anyone will be able to view on a<br>
computer. One day, say the astronomers, schoolchildren will be able to display<br>
on their computers the same images experts use to study the heavens. <br>
"This is not just a telescope," said Jim Crocker of Johns Hopkins University,<br>
one of nine organizations participating in the project. "This is a science<br>
factory." <br>
Members of the project team unfurled a 35-foot-long photo swatch of the<br>
heavens<br>
taken during the project's "first light," the initial pictures taken by a new<br>
telescope. The photo contained thousands upon thousands of stellar objects in<br>
different colors. <br>
"What you see is 1 percent of one second of data from this instrument," said<br>
Bruce Margon of the University of Washington, the science director of the<br>
project. He said that by the time the survey is finished, it will have<br>
collected 10 terabytes (10 followed by 13 zeros) of data. The amount of data<br>
will equal what is now stored in the Library of Congress. <br>
The goal is to completely map, in three dimensions, more than half of the<br>
heavens, cataloging 100 million of the brightest galaxies and 100,000 quasars.<br>
<i>&gt;From its location at Apache Point, N.M., north of White Sands, the telescope</i><br>
cannot see some of the sky over the Southern Hemisphere. <br>
For the galaxy catalog, the telescope will be able to detect objects out to 2<br>
billion light-years. For quasars, the most energetic objects in the universe,<br>
the telescope will see out to 10 billion light-years. A light-year is the<br>
distance travels in one year, or about 6 trillion miles. <br>
"For quasars, we get to the very end (of the universe), as deep as the Hubble"<br>
Space Telescope, said Neta Bahcall, a Princeton astronomer and a member of the<br>
survey team. <br>
The 2.5-meter telescope is teamed with a digital camera that Mike Turner of<br>
Fermilab, one of the sponsoring institutions, called "the most complicated<br>
camera ever built." <br>
The camera includes 54 light amplifiers and is able to gather more pixels of<br>
light than the human eye. In contrast to digital cameras that capture<br>
images on<br>
tiny chips of silicon, the camera includes a full square foot of silicon. <br>
Images, in digital form, flow from the camera into a computer system at the<br>
rate of 8.5 million bytes a second, said Constance Rockosi, a University of<br>
Chicago graduate student credited with much of the key assembly work on the<br>
camera. <br>
The system includes two spectrographs, instruments that break down the<br>
wavelengths of light, that will be able to tell the composition of objects,<br>
their speed of motion and their distance from Earth. <br>
Spectrographs have been used for decades by astronomers, but not like this,<br>
said Crocker. <br>
"In the first two weeks, we will collect more spectra than all of the other<br>
surveys in history," he said. <br>
Margon said the current sky survey by astronomers is a 40-year-old collection<br>
of black-and-white photo plates taken at the Palomar Observatory with a<br>
conventional astronomy camera. <br>
The new survey will go out at least 40 times farther and will be in five<br>
colors. "This will be a permanent digital encyclopedia of the sky," he said. <br>
Eventually, the work will be contained on 200 CD ROM computer disks and be<br>
available on the Internet. People will be able to slip in a disk or connect to<br>
the Web site "www.sdss.org" and see high definition views of the heavens. <br>
"For generations to come, many groups will be able to study galaxies and<br>
clusters of galaxies," said Bahcall. "With this data, we'll be able to take a<br>
journey through the universe." <br>
The first light image of the survey was unveiled at the national meeting of<br>
the<br>
American Astronomical Society. <br>
