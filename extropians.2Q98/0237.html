Oops, accidentally pressed send on that last one... to conclude...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The structure of the military is as well hirarchically as the structure of  </i><br>
<i>&gt;the industry. Both have structures where competence and responsibility are  </i><br>
<i>&gt;split from the top to the bottom; the people on the top make the decisions  </i><br>
<i>&gt;and have a high responsibillity whereas the people at the bottom carry out  </i><br>
<i>&gt;orders with a low responsibillity; only the managment -- the industrial ge- </i><br>
<i>&gt;neral staff -- could change the production and the structure of the firm  </i><br>
<i>&gt;and have command of this structure of working.</i><br>
<p>
...  if organizing in another way would improve efficiency, then I suspect<br>
you'd see more organizations incorporating it.  But I'm not sure about this.<br>
<p>
Either way, because companies DON'T have the power to force their workers<br>
to do anything (legally) they are fundamentally different from the military.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Because workers and human beings like Bill Gates or Rockefeller are *not*  </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the same level. Rich people have enough money to build up a firm; there- </i><br>
<i>&gt;fore for them are to work for wage or to work for their own firms a real  </i><br>
<i>&gt;alternativ; but if you have to work for wage and must spend most of your  </i><br>
<i>&gt;wage for your survive you are not able to earn enough money to build up  </i><br>
<i>&gt;your own firm. Therefore you are forces to earn wage your hole life.</i><br>
<p>
See my last e-mail...  Workers can sell their labor to other firms or<br>
invest in their own wages.  Neither of these are theoretical; both of these<br>
DO happen regularly.  Therefore this model of the labor market is<br>
completely wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Every costs of interests of all firms who produce, transport or sell a  </i><br>
<i>&gt;product are part of the price of this product. Every buyer of a product  </i><br>
<i>&gt;have to pay the price -- and all costs of interests inside. Rich people  </i><br>
<i>&gt;could invest there money and could earn this costs of interests back which  </i><br>
<i>&gt;they have to pay inside the prices -- or they earn more. But poor people  </i><br>
<i>&gt;who cann't invest their money because they need this money to survive can-  </i><br>
<i>&gt;not earn cost of interests back. Therefore they are not on the same level  </i><br>
<i>&gt;with the firm- and capital-owners. And therefore they cannot co-operate  </i><br>
<i>&gt;voluntary on the same level.</i><br>
<p>
You're wrong, because (at least in America) the poor DO invest, ESPECIALLY<br>
when they strike.  And even the poor can sell their labor to another firm.<br>
This model is completely and demonstrably wrong.<br>
