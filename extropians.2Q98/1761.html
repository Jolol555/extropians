<i>&gt; Actually, I think there are free market incentives for organizations accounting</i><br>
<i>&gt; for their waste.</i><br>
<p>
The history of the economic development of the world can be described as a <br>
process of internalizing costs and benefits.  (An internalized cost is one that <br>
must be paid by the entity making the decision; an internalized benefit is one <br>
that is received by the entity making the decision.  The alternative is an <br>
externalized cost/benefit, which goes to some person who doesn't make the <br>
decision.  As an example, if the smoke from my fire makes it hard to breathe in <br>
my home, the cost of that smoke is internalized; but if it flows instead into your <br>
home, that's externalized.  Guess when I'll be most interested in controlling the <br>
smoke...)<br>
<p>
We had just seriously begun internalizing the costs of pollution through <br>
common law and the market, when the government stepped in to protect <br>
polluters from having to reimburse their neighbors for pollution-caused damage.  <br>
So instead we have internalized the cost of following government-imposed <br>
pollution regulations, which are (at best) only loosely correlated with pollution.<br>
