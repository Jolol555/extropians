Ahhh...Michael ....I don't like flame wars, so I will try a last time to<br>
explain you, calmly, friendly, our point of view. Because I suppose that<br>
by "socialist transhumanists" you mean everybody who don't share your<br>
extreme positions. So, please first, stop to imagine there are two<br>
camps, red-commies-stalinian- socialists on one side,<br>
libertarians-individualist-capitalists on the other; you will really<br>
progress in your  analysis. May I remind you that most of the stalinian<br>
crimes were due to the belief there was only two camps: the "nice guys"<br>
and the others, who had to be fighted and eventually killed. If you<br>
really don't like communism, you should stop to adopt their main<br>
characteristics, don't you think ?<br>
So now, let's go to Michael's (Bowling) definition : we should be pissed<br>
of , really ? By saying that, you prove one more time that you didn't<br>
understand most of the arguments of your opponents. Or worse, you didn't<br>
hear. That's sad. So open your ears and listen :<br>
Nobody here is opposed to individual freedom. The socialist<br>
transhumanists (by this term, you certainly want to name the mad guys<br>
who think that the free market defects have to be corrected by a welfare<br>
system) are advocates of individual freedom. that's why we want to be<br>
sure that ANYBODY (sorry for shouting, but the message seems hard to<br>
pass) can decide of his evolution, according to his own desires, and not<br>
be forbidden to succeed because he is born on the wrong side of the<br>
Bronx.<br>
Is this clear enough, or must I capitalize other words?<br>
You can disagree with my opinion; I just want you to understand it and<br>
be fair in your opposition, instead of using low-level (and constant,<br>
and frequently out of topic, as here)  propaganda. The worst thing in<br>
this, (from your own point of view) being that you give a very bad image<br>
of your own camp, therefore forbidding any intelligent discussion on<br>
economical matters on this list. Fortunately, there are more open-minded<br>
libertarians.<br>
