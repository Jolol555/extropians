<p>
Er, no.  I do not assert that this thinking is flawed because you're going<br>
to hell.  That argument itself is inherently problematic.  Instead, I want<br>
to fall back on my previous argument (I think this was before you walked<br>
in) that IF an objective reality exists, then acting as if it doesn't or<br>
presuming false things to be true to any degree will ultimately be bad for<br>
us; that is, that adhering to falsehood is directly opposed to our own<br>
self interests.<br>
<p>
I don't think I need to provide a lot of examples to demonstrate this; I'm<br>
sure you can come up with a wide variety on your own.  Falsehood is<br>
inextricably coupled with human suffering and death in a non-trivial way.<br>
<p>
I'm not opposed to fuzzy logic as a tool to help us to better approximate<br>
the truth; ultimately it may be the only tool available to prove certain<br>
facts which escape axiomatic logic.  However, I am opposed to assertions<br>
that the truth ITSELF is fuzzy; even in quantum mechanics, arguably the<br>
weirdest branch of physics we've ever discovered, things are weird in a<br>
very specific way.  An electron, despite its particulate nature, will<br>
diffract in a VERY specific way described by our equations.  The fact that<br>
the cat in the box is, to some extent, dead and not dead simultaneously<br>
does NOT mean that all things are and are not true; the diffraction of<br>
light on a screen is not ambiguous in any way.  The behavior of photons<br>
may be weird, and may be truly random, but there are certain behaviors<br>
which you will never see and which quantum mechanics predicts can never<br>
happen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's one of the defining characteristics of bivalent logic, and it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophical child, logical atomism. I do not believe that historical </i><br>
<i>&gt; precedence is sufficient reason to declare all other systems of logic to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be impossible or immoral.  All that is necesary for a system of logic to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be valid is that true conclusions follow from true premises, which fuzzy </i><br>
<i>&gt; logic satisifies.</i><br>
<p>
Listen to what you're saying!  "True conclusions from true premises..."<br>
Not conclusions which are true to some degree from true premises, but TRUE<br>
conclusions.  Again, I'll buy your logic as an approximation of the real<br>
truth, but not your fuzzy truth.<br>

<i>&gt; You have caught me.  I am a mystic.  In fact, I am a Jungian </i><br>
<i>&gt; psychologist.;)</i><br>
<p>
Hah!  Gotcha.  I have a nose for these things.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are three definitions of mysticism in my dictionary &lt;American </i><br>
<i>&gt; Heritage&gt; :</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. Immediate consciousness of the transcendent or ultimate reality or </i><br>
<i>&gt; God.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. A belief in the existence of essential realities beyond perceptual of </i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual apprehension that are accessible to subjective experience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.Vague, groundless speculation</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose that you mean mysticism in the third sense, while I support </i><br>
<i>&gt; the second definition and have occasionally experienced the first.  You </i><br>
<i>&gt; are correct that mystical beliefs are spreading quite rapidly in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Western scientific world.  This change in acceptance started with the </i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum physics revolution, but I think the current upswing can be </i><br>
<i>&gt; blamed on the spread of the Penrose/Hameroff quantum brain meme.  Many </i><br>
<i>&gt; people still disagree with the theory that the human brain works via </i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum computation, but the point has been reached that most people </i><br>
<i>&gt; will admit that it is possible to both give credence to the idea and be </i><br>
<i>&gt; in one's right mind. </i><br>
<p>
Depends on which idea you're referring to.  That the brain is a quantum<br>
computer?  This is not unbelievable, a priori, but once you get down to<br>
the evidence, we will ultimately find out if the brain is a quantum<br>
computer.  Science, even QM, always wants to boil down to truth<br>
or falsehood.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Mysticism becomes sensible under these conditions by replacing 'God </i><br>
<i>&gt; or ultimate reality' in the first definition with 'undifferentiated </i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum field'.  Transcendental Consciousness is a state of </i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness in which there are no qualities (dichotomies) whatsoever, </i><br>
<i>&gt; which is equivalent to the state of a quantum computer before you open </i><br>
<i>&gt; it up and look inside.  Such a state cannot be experienced by </i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual or perceptual faculties (which I think are just different </i><br>
<i>&gt; manifestations of the same thing) because by definition the intellect </i><br>
<i>&gt; (logic) seperates things into parts.  This includes fuzzy logic, which </i><br>
<i>&gt; differs from Aristotelian logic only in that it allows for partial </i><br>
<i>&gt; dichotomies.</i><br>
<p>
Your physics themselves are a bit fuzzy here.  In a quantum computer, not<br>
ALL dichotomies are eliminated, but rather what makes the quantum computer<br>
useful is that all possible conclusions interact with one another in such<br>
a way as to produce the correct solution to the assigned problem, and<br>
never the wrong one.  And when I say correct, I mean REALLY correct, TRULY<br>
correct; the equations, again, provide no ambiguity on this point. <br>
Certain principles which we use in modern chemistry are derived from the<br>
fact that quantum mechanics states that some things always (or never)<br>
happen; the Pauli exclusion principle leaps to mind. <br>
<p>
So again, even in quantum mechanics, we ultimately find ourselves looking<br>
at certain things which are definitely true and others which are<br>
definitely false.  Quantum provides no support for the conclusions which<br>
you have drawn; not that it matters, because truth and falsehood are<br>
meaningless to your paradigm anyway.  However, suffice it to say that<br>
science will not help you in your march towards oblivion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    It is worth remembering that the seperation between mysticism and </i><br>
<i>&gt; logic has only been a recent historical phenomenon.  All early </i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific systems had decidedly mystical elements; from the Jewish </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kabalists (who invented alchemy which begat chemistry) to the cult of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Pythagorans, to Plato and his forms.  It is not suprising that </i><br>
<i>&gt; mysticism and logic are once again uniting. I think the division only </i><br>
<i>&gt; occured in the first place because the Catholic Church decided the </i><br>
<i>&gt; ambiguity of mysticism to be a threat to its authority and managed to </i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly stamp it out in the Western world.  Now that the power of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; church is waning, mysticism is once again flourishing.</i><br>
<p>
Yet we find the most adherent followers of objectivism are atheists, not<br>
mysticists, with an eye on the truth, not on the abolition of truth.  And<br>
though I doubt such things would interest you, since you reject the axiom<br>
of non-contradiction, those philosophers which you refer to throughout the<br>
ages were mysticists, yes, it's true, but that's about the extent to which<br>
they agreed on anything.<br>
