<i>&gt; Can we take it as a given, now, that Mr. Hollick doesn't believe in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the existence of Linux?</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;: go to   <a href="http://www.pir.org">http://www.pir.org</a>  first.  Assume I know most of what <br>
you read there.<br>
<p>
Linux is a good example of what I'm talking about.  It doesn't matter how <br>
good it it, nor how cheap it it - it cannot succeed (network effects); and <br>
if it looked like it was going to, its producers would come unglued.  <br>
Like Amiga.  Like Atari.  Like Mac.  Like OS/2.  Like everything else.<br>
<p>
  The Feds like the 'take' from the Microsoft 'Backdoors'; and the <br>
  'commercial intelligence' take (which is worth unvouchered billions) <br>
  they open into far to much to give them up, even though they're <br>
  blatantly unlawful and illegal.  Then, there's all the 'law enforcement' <br>
  stuff.  And the 'political intelligence.'  And the military <br>
  intelligence.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Put your money where your mouth is.</i><br>
<p>
      That would be silly, would be in breach of savings security <br>
      guidelines, and would obstruct both talking and eating.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What with all those Intelligence connections you boast about,</i><br>
<p>
I hope I don't 'boast' about these.  I might mention some of them from <br>
time to time, when it's relevant.<br>
<p>
  You have to understand that POTUS (the President of the United States) <br>
  gives the orders to the intelligence agencies; via the Director, Central <br>
  Intelligence (George Tenet) for the Intelligence Community; and via the <br>
  DoD for NSA.<br>
  <br>
  You may also have noticed he's a 'Friend of Bill's.  I don't imagine <br>
  he'll be putting America's most profitable company out of business and <br>
  a friend of his into deep doo-doo any time soon.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Remember: I've discussed all this with NSA, GCHQ and NATO's Technical <br>
  Directorate.  And a few other people besides.  No boasting, I promise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; it shouldn't be too much of a problem, should it?</i><br>
<p>
  Depends what size of problem you're used to...   Overthrowing the <br>
  Government of the USSR was easier than this...  &gt;:-}<br>
