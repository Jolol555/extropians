I'd like to know your response to this.<br>

Subject: The Happy Robot<br>
<p>
First, I'd like to commend Ross Levatter on his excellently conceived<br>
thought experiment regarding Rand's robot.  I'd also like to say "Damn<br>
you for stealing my thunder!"  &lt;grin&gt;  <br>
<p>
I've been working on this essay on-and-off for more than a month now and<br>
finally finished it just recently.  Planning all along to post it to the<br>
list, I decided I better take a couple days to catch up on reading the<br>
posts of others before I threw mine in.  I was glad to see the suicide<br>
thread continue - which my essay ties into nicely; ditto for the<br>
"morality of smoking" debate.  Then I couldn't help but laugh out loud<br>
when I saw Ross Levatter's thought experiment which hit on exactly the<br>
startlingly original (I thought) heart of my essay.  Oh well, here it is<br>
anyway.  At least I know there is one person on the list who should<br>
agree with me!<br>
<p>
By the way, for anyone interested, I'll be presenting the material of<br>
this essay in one of the "participant sponsored sessions" at the IOS<br>
conference in Boulder.  I'd appreciate an opportunity to get your<br>
feedback, criticisms, etc. in person there - as well as put faces with<br>
some of the interesting personalities I've met on this list.<br>
<p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>
	I'm a huge fan of Objectivist metaphysics and epistemology - it<br>
was these that opened my eyes to the possibility of actually discovering<br>
important truths by studying philosophy.  I am a big fan of the ethics,<br>
too, which show people they should proudly put themselves as their own<br>
highest value.  However, as I will show, Ayn Rand's fundamental<br>
assertion that "an organism's *life* is it's standard of value"<br>
(emphasis mine), and therefore man's proper basis for morality and<br>
ethics needs to be replaced with the idea that an organism's *happiness*<br>
is it's standard of value.  Ultimately, I agree with her that an<br>
individual should act in accordance with the demands of life, but not<br>
because that is an end in itself - rather, because it is a *means* to<br>
achieve the ultimate value, the true end-in-itself, happiness.  Without<br>
happiness, biological life becomes mechanistic and valueless and even<br>
the most perfectly rational animal will find no reason to pursue it.<br>
<p>
	In this essay, I first hope to establish that, although<br>
metaphysically and biologically it is the alternative of life/death that<br>
resulted in consciousness, volition and the capacity for<br>
happiness/unhappiness in humans, it is the happiness/unhappiness<br>
alternative - however created - that gives rise to all our values.<br>
After unseating life from the pinnacle of our values, I'll reintroduce a<br>
more broadly defined form of life which I call "genetic life" - but now<br>
as a close second to happiness in the hierarchy of values.  From there,<br>
I'll briefly trace the Objectivist reasoning with happiness replacing<br>
life.  Finally, I'll show how some difficult problems Objectivism has<br>
had, go away when you place happiness in it's rightful spot and put<br>
genetic life as the ultimate value serving happiness.  (Although I will<br>
leave happiness as self-evident for the purpose of this essay, if a<br>
definition and description of "happiness" is desired to better<br>
understand what is replacing "life" here as the ultimate value, I would<br>
direct the reader to Ted Keer's essay, "Happiness: Passionate Serenity",<br>
at <a href="http://eden-backend.rutgers.edu/~kiaer/essays.html">http://eden-backend.rutgers.edu/~kiaer/essays.html</a> as the best effort<br>
I've seen to date.)<br>
<p>
<p>
	In The Virtue of Selfishness, Rand says "To challenge the basic<br>
premise of . . . ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values?  Why<br>
does man need them?". (VOS, p16)  Since this is, indeed, the challenge I<br>
am making, I will follow her instruction.  For the first question, I<br>
accept Rand's answer, and I hope to correct her answer to the second<br>
question.  In answer to the first question, Rand says:<br>
<p>
	"Value" is that which one acts to gain or keep.<br>
	The concept "value" is not a primary; it presupposes <br>
	an answer to the question: of value to *whom* and for <br>
	*what*?  It presupposes an entity capable of acting to <br>
	achieve a goal in the face of an alternative.  Where no <br>
	alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible.<br>
<p>
The alternative she then focuses on is that of life or death.  Her<br>
answer to the question "Why does man need values?" is: to stay alive.<br>
For any living organism, "the ultimate value . . . is the organism's<br>
*life*." (VOS, p17 - emphasis Rand's)  <br>
	To make her point "fully clear", she asks us to "imagine an<br>
immortal, indestructible robot", and claims "such an entity would not be<br>
able to have any values". (VOS, p16)  Notice that Rand did not choose a<br>
hypothetical indestructible *organism* but rather an indestructible<br>
*robot*.  The significance of this distinction is that the word "robot",<br>
and indeed her description of this entity, make clear that she is asking<br>
us to imagine an entity which, in addition to being immortal, is also<br>
unfeeling (i.e. incapable of happiness or unhappiness).  Thus, we have a<br>
contrast between Rand's immortal *and* unfeeling entity, and the mortal,<br>
feeling entities whose source of values we are trying to determine.<br>
<p>
	But which of these two alternatives, life/death (mortality) or<br>
happiness/unhappiness (feeling) is truly the one that gives rise to<br>
values?  Or do values perhaps require both?  To sort this out we need<br>
two new hypothetical entities, each with one of these alternatives, but<br>
not the other.  One entity would be immortal and feeling - call this<br>
entity "IF".  The other would be mortal and unfeeling - call it "MU".<br>
If we can demonstrate that one of these entities has a source of values<br>
(and thus a means for decision making, a way to judge right and wrong<br>
for itself, etc.), and the other does not, then we have identified the<br>
alternative that is the true source of values for humans.  If neither<br>
stands on its own then it must be the combination that is required.<br>
	First, consider MU:  Being mortal implies that certain actions<br>
are required for MU to maintain life, but nothing about life feels good<br>
to MU and nothing about death feels bad.  MU is left with no way to<br>
"prefer" life and so has nothing driving any decision.  All MU can do is<br>
decide by whim whether it will try to live or not - perhaps by flipping<br>
a coin - and then act accordingly.  Or maybe considering that<br>
alternative would never seem very important to it and instead it would<br>
employ it's volition deciding some other randomly selected alternative -<br>
again by flipping a coin since it won't care either way.  But then, it<br>
might occur to MU that deciding and acting isn't really all it's cracked<br>
up to be, at which point it might just sit down (or not) and stare<br>
blankly at the moss beginning to grow on it's shady side.<br>
     Now consider IF: Although there is no way for its existence to end,<br>
IF does indeed care that painful things do not happen to it and that<br>
pleasurable things do.  If it felt pain from heat, it would have every<br>
bit as much impetus to remove it's hand (if it had one) from a hot stove<br>
as you or I would.  Also, if it felt a deep satisfaction from developing<br>
relationships with other entities, the fact that it doesn't need them to<br>
survive would not stop it from deriving as much joy from such<br>
relationships as it could.  If it got the kind of pleasure from sex that<br>
humans do, it would definitely spend a lot of time at that.  Of course<br>
it might also just do heroin constantly - except that simply not dying<br>
probably does *not* make that form of pleasure workable over the long<br>
haul.<br>
     Clearly, only IF has a way to judge what is right and wrong for it;<br>
MU does not.  This means it is, indeed, the alternative of<br>
happiness/unhappiness, the ability to feel, to care, to give a rip, that<br>
drives the need and the use for morality, not the alternative of life or<br>
death.  Which in turn means happiness, not life, is the ultimate value,<br>
the end-in-itself toward which every action of an organism is properly<br>
directed.  Interestingly, it seems that Rand herself at times saw that<br>
happiness was actually the ultimate value.  For example, as part of<br>
Galt's speech in Atlas Shrugged, she writes: "Life is the reward of<br>
virtue, and happiness is the goal and reward of life."  (AS, p.939)<br>
This is a pretty clear statement of the relation between life and<br>
happiness, with happiness being the end-in-itself, with no further<br>
explanation necessary - or possible.<br>
<p>
<p>
Of course, the fact that all the capacity for pleasure and pain in<br>
humans developed because it furthered "life" in some way means that the<br>
requirements of "life" is a pretty good estimate of what is likely to<br>
make us happy.  Consequently, I place "life" second only to happiness in<br>
the hierarchy of values.  However, this "life" - the evolution of which<br>
resulted in our happiness/unhappiness mechanisms - is not the life of an<br>
individual organism, which Rand talked about as being its highest value.<br>
It is now a broader form, call it "genetic life", that spans individual<br>
lives and of which an individual life is only a part.  Maybe we can<br>
think of it this way: since genetic life needs us as individuals to make<br>
decisions in it's favor, it has created an incentive program for the<br>
volitional individuals which make it up - to make it in *our* interest<br>
to act in *its* interest.  The better we understand genetic life and its<br>
requirements, the more likely we are to find pursuing it helpful in<br>
achieving our ultimate goal - happiness.<br>
	In this essay, I will stop short of defining precisely what this<br>
"genetic life" is, the pursuit of which will best serve the happiness of<br>
an individual.  It may be the genetic code contained in that<br>
individual's cells, it may be the gene-pool of it's interbreeding group<br>
or it's species, or it may be as broad as all life.  I personally expect<br>
to find that it is a hierarchy of some sort, where genetic codes more<br>
similar to our own are valued more than, but not to the exclusion of,<br>
codes more distant.  We care about our own children, but we also care<br>
about the children of others, animals other than humans and maybe even<br>
insects or plants to a lesser degree.  However, it is the job of<br>
science, not philosophy, to define and describe this genetic life that<br>
is the ultimate source of our happiness.  Philosophy gets us to<br>
"happiness" as our ultimate goal, but it is the scientific study of<br>
evolution that has to take it from there.  In fact, if it turned out<br>
evolution was wrong and we were created by some super-entity (to pick a<br>
contending theory still quite popular today), philosophy would still get<br>
us to happiness as our ultimate value, but the study of that<br>
super-entity and what it had in mind for us to do would rightly replace<br>
the study of evolution as the key to determining how we should live.<br>
<p>
<p>
	So what impact do these changes have on Objectivist philosophy?<br>
I'll follow Rand's reasoning briefly, now with happiness as the ultimate<br>
value, to examine this.  Rand argues that "it is only an ultimate goal,<br>
an *end in itself* that makes the existence of values possible." (VOS,<br>
pp17-18)  Values, in Rand's formulation, are "that which one acts to<br>
gain and/or keep" (VOS, p16) in pursuit of that ultimate goal.  Thus,<br>
they now become those things which, objectively evaluated, further the<br>
organism's happiness, rather than it's life.  By "objectively<br>
evaluated", I mean that it is not arbitrary what makes people happy,<br>
that our potential for happiness was created in some particular way, and<br>
with some specific nature which is not a matter of our choice.  Physical<br>
pain and pleasure mechanisms are the most easily perceived instance of<br>
this, but I would contend that the love a parent feels for their child<br>
is equally beyond our choice.  This is not to say that it is impossible<br>
for someone to not care about their children, only that it is as<br>
unnatural as enjoying physical pain.  Morality Rand defines as "a code<br>
of values accepted by choice" (AS p932, OPAR p214), but it now starts<br>
not with the choice to live as she would contend, but with the choice to<br>
be happy.  Virtue is still "the act by which one gains and/or keeps [a<br>
value]", (VOS, p27) and I see nothing to contradict her primary virtue<br>
of rationality and six derivative virtues of independence, integrity,<br>
honesty, justice, productiveness and pride.  I like David Kelly's<br>
addition of benevolence to the Objectivist virtues as well.  However,<br>
I've always liked the virtues of my Christian upbringing (what they call<br>
the fruits of the spirit) of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,<br>
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control, too, and I hope to<br>
find that there is reason to give some of these better standing than<br>
they have without the notion of "genetic life" as a rational value for<br>
individuals.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sticky problems that Objectivism has - solved!<br>
<p>
	Many of us find that we really DO care about others who are not<br>
likely to impact our survival, or even our flourishing.  Now we can see<br>
that perhaps their life can be important to our happiness independent of<br>
it's importance to our life simply because it is in the interest of the<br>
genetic life of which we are a part.  Therefore the well-being of others<br>
could become anchored as an objective source of happiness for us.  Note<br>
that I do not claim to have done that anchoring here, only offered the<br>
possibility of how it might be done in the future.<br>
<p>
	Sometimes in Objectivist reasoning, happiness is considered<br>
impossible except according to objective values and sometimes it is<br>
considered that our emotions (including happiness) are completely<br>
determined by what we value through reason (i.e. we are born tabula rasa<br>
- including our emotions).  An example of the first take on happiness<br>
from Atlas Shrugged is: "Happiness is possible only to a rational man"<br>
(p939).  An example of the second from OPAR is: "Emotions are automatic<br>
consequences of a mind's past conclusions" (p 161).  The first implies<br>
that living according to irrational conclusions will make one unhappy,<br>
the second implies that living according to one's incorrect past<br>
conclusions could make one just as happy until they ultimately resulted<br>
in death.  With "genetic life" defining and refining our nature, what<br>
results in our greatest happiness is ultimately beyond our control - but<br>
it turns out that a big *part* of what, according to our nature, makes<br>
us happy is living according to our rational convictions.<br>
<p>
	With this new formulation, there is no need to explain that when<br>
we say "life" we don't just mean survival, but we mean "flourishing",<br>
"life man qua man" or "life as a complete person".  Happiness covers all<br>
of this.  (Don't worry, we can keep the "man qua man" formulation if we<br>
really think it sounds cool. &lt;grin&gt;)<br>
 <br>
	Now there is no need to explain the many things we do that are<br>
difficult indeed to tie to our survival.  If they make us happy, that is<br>
explanation enough - although it may behoove us to examine the<br>
evolutionary origins and long-term consequences of these sources of<br>
happiness to be sure following them will not lead to diminished<br>
happiness in the future.  Our eating habits are a prime example of this.<br>
In our evolutionary past there was no such thing as being "too fat" -<br>
there just wasn't enough food around.  (Have you ever seen a truly<br>
rotund wild animal of any kind?)  So we developed a natural tendency to<br>
stuff our face with as much fat, sugar, etc. as came within arms reach.<br>
But now, with food as cheap and easily available as it is, many of us<br>
find that our nature misleads us.  We have to resist the temptation of<br>
that second or third luscious &lt;insert the name of your particular<br>
fatty-food weakness here&gt; in order to preserve our health and our long<br>
term happiness.<br>
<p>
	The moral evaluation of suicide is handled rather well with<br>
happiness first.  In Objectivist thinking, the choice to live precedes<br>
morality, but now it is the choice to be happy which precedes it.  If<br>
you decide not to value happiness, then you truly have no way to judge<br>
what you should do in any situation - including suicide.  If you decide<br>
that happiness is what matters to you, then you can evaluate any action,<br>
including suicide.  The choice to end your life becomes rational and<br>
right if living an unhappy life is truly the only alternative.  For<br>
example, you might find suicide the right thing to do if, after numerous<br>
happy decades of life, you find the only life you have left is<br>
semi-conscious and/or filled with pain and expensive care - eating up<br>
the money you had socked away for you grandchildren's education, say.<br>
More often, however, in the case of people considering suicide, there is<br>
still more happiness than unhappiness possible for them, and seeking<br>
help in finding that happiness is the right choice rather than suicide.<br>
<p>
<p>
	So what does all this buy you?  What good does it do us to<br>
understand it?  For me, the key realization is that if my life is *not*<br>
my highest value, there are things out there that I should value more<br>
than my own life.  Think about that.  There are values for you greater<br>
than your own life.  Since values are those things which further the<br>
ultimate goal of happiness, that means there should be ways for you to<br>
be happier than you would be if you saved your own life (e.g. if you<br>
were cured of cancer).  It also means there are things out there for<br>
which you would be truly and rationally happy to give your life.  If I<br>
was going to give people one clue as to how to achieve true happiness it<br>
would be this - "Find something you would die for, and live for that".<br>
If you can't see how that is possible, or doubt that it is, let me offer<br>
one suggestion: children.  Have your own or borrow someone elses, raise<br>
them, teach them, and see if you don't come to love them more than you<br>
love your own life.  All of our capacity for happiness was created<br>
through evolution, and the cornerstone of evolution is adults raising<br>
successful children.  Based on that understanding of our nature, and on<br>
what I've heard parents say, I believe that children (and maybe not only<br>
our own) are a prime candidate to become a greater value for you than<br>
your own life.  Of course, this may not apply for everyone, and there<br>
may be many other such values for you depending on your particular<br>
talents, opportunities, vision, etc.  But to paraphrase Dr. Martin<br>
Luther King: "If you've never found anything you would die for, then<br>
you've never really lived".<br>
<p>
	Having philosophized for pages now, there is one thing I would<br>
like to acknowledge in closing.  That is, that while philosophy may be<br>
able to determine that you should be seeking your own happiness, and<br>
science may be able to shed light on what is likely to make you happy;<br>
reason is not your only tool in the pursuit of happiness.  Developing a<br>
sensitivity to what in life is truly making you happy right now,<br>
learning what makes others happy and trying it for yourself, trusting<br>
what has made people happy for generations, acting on an inspiration<br>
before you know exactly why, etc. are all part of the process as well.<br>
No amount of thinking can replace *all* of what millennia of evolution<br>
have given us - but I believe it truly can put a proper foundation under<br>
what all the experimentation yields and cement it together into a<br>
unified whole.  And ultimately, no matter how you get there, living<br>
truly happy is all that really matters.<br>
<p>
	Nathaniel Branded said recently "you are bigger than<br>
Objectivism" to a standing ovation from his IOS audience.  In the same<br>
spirit, I would like to say "you are bigger than life" - but I'll<br>
understand if you don't stand and applaud.  : )<br>
