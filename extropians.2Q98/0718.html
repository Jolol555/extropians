<i>&gt;  "Atheism" = a-theism. Since "theism" means a belief in a god, "atheism" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the absence of belief in a god. In that sense, I am an atheist. An atheist</i><br>
<i>&gt;  *may* actively deny that there is a god of any particular description, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  may even claim that they can prove that there is no god. However, that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  not the essence of atheism. The essence is simply the absence of belief.</i><br>
<p>
Let's try a little experiment.  I'm about to ask you a question about the<br>
existence of some thing, X.  At the moment, you have no belief about X's<br>
existence, since I have not named it.  And yet it would seem *very* odd to say<br>
that your "simpl[e] absence of belief" qualifies you as an "atheist" with<br>
regard to X.  (Oh, here's that question I promised:  Is there such a thing as<br>
"aXist"?)<br>
<p>
Hence my conclusion that atheists do more than simply not believe in<br>
gods--they affirmatively disbelieve in them.  To judge from later comments, I<br>
think that you would embrace that description of *your* atheism,  Max.  You<br>
claim,   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I know there is no such being,</i><br>
<p>
which certainly seems to imply that you have some sort of proof.  Perhaps you<br>
are one of those extraordinary atheists (I'd expect nothing less!) who go<br>
above and beyond what you call the "essence" of the doctrine, to offer proofs<br>
of nonexistence and to make affirmative claims.  Well and good--but what is<br>
the "essence" of atheism if more than mere lack of belief and less than a<br>
claim of proof?  I think that, in fact, your sort of atheism is the only sort<br>
that makes sense:  You claim to have a proof that "no such being" exists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I would take the same position if someone claimed that an invisible,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  intangible elf lived on top of the Empire State Building, where it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  controlled the minds of the heads of state. Since there is zero evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;  for such a belief, and any predictions such a beliefs makes are going to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  either unfalsifiable or plain wrong, I would reject that belief. I would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  an atheist (or an a-elfist) not an agnostic (or ag-elfist)! That doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mean I claim that I can definitely prove that there is no such elf.</i><br>
<p>
I would reject elfism, too, as utterly useless for anything but amusement.  I<br>
suppose the question for me, then, is, "Are you an agelfist?"  It would sound<br>
strange, I admit, to say that I do not affirmatively disbelieve in the empire<br>
(sitting *and* directing) elf that you describe.  But it would be logically<br>
consistent for me to claim agnosticism with regard to that and all other such<br>
nonfalsiable claims--and I long ago decided to opt for logical consistency<br>
over strangeness.  Heh.<br>
<p>
Let me offer an alternative and somewhat risky response, though:  I regard<br>
some gods as more plausible than the empire (but not empirical!) elf.  I can<br>
imagine one of us eventually attaining something quite like the powers that<br>
some religions attribute to gods (granted that omniscience/omnipotence looks<br>
tricky by any measure; I'm talking about lower-case gods, here).  Who of us<br>
would assume the elf's form?  Nobody with taste, to be sure.  But Jupiter<br>
brains and nano-clouds sound quite stylish, and would certainly evoke<br>
religious awe from most humans.<br>
<p>
Upper-case theism remains problematic, I admit.  But I cannot solve every age-<br>
old problem while typing on company time.<br>
