Exactly.  As a morph on a often quoted parody - "It's the transition, stupid".<br>

As Robin Hanson pointed out, the vaccine against such a transition is to gain a<br>
share in the means of production.  This could be anything from owning a small farm<br>
to operating a small desktop manufacturing facility.  I hesitate to say tradition<br>
financial investment would provide an adequate vaccine in the face of possible<br>
hyper-liquidity of the market.  Currencies might fluctuate so wildly that all your<br>
investments could dry up before you knew what hit you.<br>
