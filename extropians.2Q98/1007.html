<p>
Off hand, I can not think of a free market mechanism that would serve as a<br>
solution given your criteria.  However, in this scenario, giving someone<br>
everything necessary to survive comfortably (but nothing more) would likely<br>
be an insignificant cost, even in the aggregate.  It would only take a<br>
small inkling of altruism to spare the scraps of energy required to sustain<br>
the transition era impoverished.  The impoverished add no value to the<br>
economy, but cost very little as well.<br>
<p>
<p>
However, I think the scenario will play out a little differently than as<br>
you describe.  The transition of marketable skills may happen somewhat<br>
prior to the transition of the production economy, creating a very<br>
uncomfortable gap for those who cannot adapt and whose skills are no longer<br>
valued.  Information/knowledge economic transitions are happening now,<br>
while strong nanotech is still decades off.  In this case, it may be far<br>
too expensive to support those who cannot adapt, since the difference<br>
between skill value and cost of support would be large enough to be a very<br>
significant burden on the productive segment of society, far more than<br>
altruism is likely to support.<br>
<p>
This transition may not have a "feel good" solution.<br>
