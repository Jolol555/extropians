&lt;&lt; So even in the unlikely possibility that there is something more<br>
fundamental  <br>
 than information we need not worry about it because we'll never understand<br>
it. <br>
 Information on the other hand we understand, in fact it's the only thing we <br>
 can understand.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
It does not follow from the fact that X is that which allows definitions to<br>
exist that X cannot be defined.  What we're looking for is information about<br>
the ontological status of information.  <br>
                <br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;        &gt;I think the question of the status of information (a set of facts <br>
<i>         &gt;about a thing or just any set of concepts?) </i><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 How about a set of facts about facts?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
That would be subsumed under the "set of facts about a thing" I think.<br>
        <br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;Only in pure mathematics is experiment unnecessary, and that is most <br>
 certainly the study of information about information. When the recursion of <br>
 the information about information idea gets very high such as in physics or <br>
 even higher in biology or sociology things are far too complicated to figure <br>
 out from  first principles and experiment is essential.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
What we're dealing with here though is a very, very basic question: Is<br>
information fundamental?  That's the kind of question to be resolved by the<br>
parent of all empirical sciences, philosophy, although its investigations can<br>
and are of course informed by the empirical sciences. <br>
<p>
And I'm not sure that it would be correct to characterize pure mathematics as<br>
the study of information about information.  Numbers need not necessarily<br>
inform us of anything but themselves.  Pure mathematics can be applied in the<br>
study of information of course.  But once we do that we're no longer studying<br>
pure mathematics but in the realm of applying mathematics.<br>
