As Paul Hughes has pointed out, this assumes a lot about how we<br>
represent information. I ran into a similar problem when running a sf<br>
roleplaying scenario where the aliens were blind - sending pictures<br>
was useless, since they couldn't figure out what they represented when<br>
displayed on their tactile screens. Our vision is heavily based on<br>
edge detection, but the aliens couldn't figure out what all the lines<br>
and curves in the signal represented since they had no obvious 2D to<br>
3D map. <br>
<p>

If the aliens want to communicate. My sf scenario actually involved a<br>
war in order to *avoid* communication; see<br>
<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game</a> for a description.<br>

I agree that it would be possible to send a message that is so<br>
unlikely to have emerged from natural processes that it is obvious<br>
that it is artificial. But interpreting it might be extremely hard.<br>
