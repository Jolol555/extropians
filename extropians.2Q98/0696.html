I was browsing through the abstracts for the second<br>
conference of the Association for the Scientific<br>
Study of Consciousness (ASSC) to be held from June<br>
19-22, 1998, in Bremen, Germany, on "Neural<br>
Correlates Of Consciousness: Empirical And Conceptual<br>
Issues", see<br>
<a href="http://www.phil.vt.edu/assc/Bremen/bremenabstracts.html">http://www.phil.vt.edu/assc/Bremen/bremenabstracts.html</a><br>
, and found the following article on a interesting<br>
psychotropic substance that I, being the 'aging<br>
home-body' that I am, had never heard of:<br>
=================<br>
MICHAEL SCHLICHTING, European College for the Study<br>
of Consoiousness (ECSC) Göttingen <br>
"Consciousness Research Using Hallucinogenic Drugs.<br>
Psychotropic Effects of the Phenethylamine DMMPEA"<br>
<p>
[CUT] In a non-comparative human study the<br>
psychoactive properties of DMMPEA<br>
(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methyl-Phenethylamine) were<br>
evaluated in 18 subjects.  In this paper the<br>
experimental design of the study und the results are<br>
presented and discussed in view of the implications<br>
for consciousness research. <br>
<p>
The specific Altered State of Consciousness (ASC)<br>
produced by hallucinogenic drugs like DMMPEA is<br>
characterized by an increase of body awareness and<br>
receptiveness of inner stimuli, activation of<br>
individual affective patterns, eyes-closed imagery<br>
and dream-like subconscious material. The<br>
consciousness remains clear and enables the subject<br>
to observe, to control und to communicate the<br>
intrapsychic changes. Embedded in an anxiety reducing<br>
psychotherapeutic setting no true hallucinetions,<br>
delusions nor psychotic reactions are observed.   All<br>
subjects recovered completely within few hours and<br>
showed no adverse reactions or unwanted after<br>
effects. Psychometric tests and clinical evidence<br>
revealed an improvement in emotional insight,<br>
self-esteem and ego-strength. <br>
=======================<br>
<p>
Someone recently asked about an online forum for<br>
discussion of nootropics &amp; psychotropics.<br>
There seems to be an interesting collection of<br>
annecdotal accounts at the following organization<br>
(the particular URL given is a good overview of what<br>
I assume is the popular version of the substance<br>
discussed above, 2-CB).<br>
<a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/2cb/2cb-dmturner.html">http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/2cb/2cb-dmturner.html</a><br>
which notes: "On some occasions 2-CB has given me<br>
visibility into what I will call the "assembly" or<br>
"machine" language of the mind."<br>
