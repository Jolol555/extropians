Abstract: In recent years there has been increasing use of the tools of<br>
dynamics in many areas of cognitive science. A sizeable portion of<br>
cognitive scientists can be understood as having taken up a dynamical<br>
approach to the study of cognition. If the heart of the dominant<br>
computational approach is the hypothesis that cognitive agents are digital<br>
computers, the heart of the alternative dynamical  approach is the<br>
hypothesis that cognitive agents are dynamical systems. This target article<br>
attempts<br>
to articulate the dynamical hypothesis, and to defend its status as an open<br>
empirical alternative to the<br>
computational hypothesis. Achieving these goals requires extensive<br>
clarification of the terrain. Digital<br>
computers and dynamical systems are characterized as specific kinds of<br>
systems. This paves the way<br>
for an elaboration of the two major components of the dynamical hypothesis:<br>
the nature hypothesis<br>
(cognitive agents are dynamical systems) and the knowledge hypothesis<br>
(cognitive agents can be<br>
understood dynamically). A wide range of objections to the dynamical<br>
hypothesis can then be<br>
rebutted. The conclusion is that cognitive systems may well be dynamical<br>
systems, and only<br>
sustained empirical research in cognitive science will determine the extent<br>
to which that is true. <br>
