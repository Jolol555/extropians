<i>&gt;        &gt;fact that we cannot measure which while we know the position </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;perfectly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But it's much deeper than just a measurement problem because Heisenberg's  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Uncertainty Principle is only a small part of Quantum Mechanics, and by the </i><br>
<i>&gt;standards of that bizarre science a conventional part.  It's a little</i><br>
strange <br>
<i>&gt;that there's a relationship between  position and momentum, and a limit on </i><br>
<i>&gt;our knowledge of the product of both,  but it's not irrational. On the other </i><br>
<i>&gt;hand there are some aspects of modern physics can only be described as</i><br>
crazy. <br>
<i>&gt;Take the famous 2 slit experiment for example, shine a light on 2 closely </i><br>
<i>&gt;spaced slits and it will produce a complex interference pattern on a film, </i><br>
<i>&gt;even if the photons are sent out one at a time. If a photon goes through one </i><br>
<i>&gt;slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the other slit, the one it didn't go </i><br>
<i>&gt;though, was there or not, but it does.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even stranger, place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit,</i><br>
and  <br>
<i>&gt;one set at  90 degrees over the other, the interference pattern disappears. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Now place a third filter set at 45 degrees one inch in front of the film</i><br>
and  <br>
<i>&gt;10 light years from the slits. The interference pattern comes back, even </i><br>
<i>&gt;though you didn't decide to put the filter in front of the film until 10</i><br>
years <br>
<i>&gt;after the photons passed the slits! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does </i><br>
<i>&gt;not enter in any of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and </i><br>
<i>&gt;we just don't know which one, it must go through the left slit only, and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;right slit only, and both slits, and no slit at all, and it must do all</i><br>
these <br>
<i>&gt;things at the same time. Fundamental ambiguity in nature? Fundamental  </i><br>
<i>&gt;ignorance of some new law of logic? Backward causality? Parallel universes?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;None of the above? I have no idea. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If this seems pretty stupid and completely ridiculous I don't blame you a</i><br>
bit, <br>

  IAN: Nevertheless (and this was the initial point <br>
  disputed) that does not mean that the truth in the <br>
  physical reality is fuzzy, as in being less than <br>
  100% true at any time. If the physical reality is<br>
  strange and chaotic, then that is the 100% truth.<br>
<p>
  The idea that it means truth is fuzzy, is simply <br>
  a measure of a disjunction between what we think<br>
  subatomic entities SHOULD do and what they do do;<br>
  thus "fuzzy truth" measures, as it does in the <br>
  macro, a disjunction between ideas and reality.<br>
