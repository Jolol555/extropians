Hello all.  I have been reading this list for some time so that I might<br>
learn what all of the participants stand for collectively and<br>
individually. The extropian and transhumanist principles, at least what I<br>
have learned about them, intrigue me greatly.  In reading the list I<br>
followed for a while the thread that pitted Reilly Jones against the<br>
majority of the list over what amounted to a discussion of the morality<br>
of abortion.  I would like to make some comments to everyone, and most<br>
importantly, to Reilly.<br>
<p>
I think that a discussion resulting in the creation of an "us and them"<br>
dichotomy, fails to exemplify and to encourage thought based on the<br>
principles of extropy.  Here is a quote directly from the Extropian<br>
Principles on Dynamic Optimism:<br>
<p>
"Problems technical, social, psychological, ecological are to be<br>
acknowledged but not allowed to dominate our thinking and our direction. <br>
We respond to gloom and defeatism by exploring and exploiting new<br>
possibilities."<br>
<p>
Continuing to argue about a social problem such as the debate of the<br>
morality of abortion does nothing more than perpetuate the problems<br>
associated with the topic.  Reilly, why not try to examine the issue from<br>
a few different perspectives.  There are few things more elusive as the<br>
idea of absolute truth, which is the impression I have regarding the<br>
anti-abortion position I have seen expressed on this list.  I am not<br>
taking the Extropian Principles as truth, but more as a set of guiding<br>
ideas.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Anders Sandberg wrote 4/7/98: &lt;My current definition of transhumanism is:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The idea that the human condition can be improved above and beyond the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current stage, through rational means in a life affirming way".&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a good stab at a definition.  As you know from past list</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussions, definitions are critical to communication, which is critical</i><br>
<i>&gt; to developing a consensual moral polity, which is critical to achieving</i><br>
<i>&gt; great aims in the future.  It seems to me that defining what a human is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; has not met with consensus and that defining what a transhuman is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore, is putting the cart before the horse.</i><br>
<p>
You have a valid point.  However, something more to consider is, "what is<br>
life?"  Is life, human or transhuman, meant to be simply existence? <br>
Should transhuman life be happy, or should it simply be existence?  I<br>
believe that life should be happy, or at least that a human has the<br>
intrinsic right to have happiness from the beginning of that existence,<br>
and even to the frequently unfortunate end.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; That said, since speculation for fun is the lifeblood of e-lists, I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; like to offer that "rational means" is wedded to the concept of "truth,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "a life affirming way" is wedded to the concept of "good."  All you</i><br>
are<br>
<i>&gt; missing is some part of your definition that is wedded to the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "beauty."  "Beauty" should enter in as an aim, what transhumanism aims</i><br>
for.<br>
<p>
Wedding rational means and truth is rather difficult.  All things,<br>
events, and thoughts are relative.  Truth relates to reality and each<br>
person has his/her individual reality.  "Rational means" is a way to<br>
improve the human condition as Anders defined the idea.  Linking "a life<br>
affirming way" and "good" is also very subjective and difficult, because<br>
good is greatly open to interpretation as I will later prove by example.<br>
I hate to use the cliche, but Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  What<br>
you see as beautiful may or may not correspond to what another person sees.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Across all scientific endeavors, at all scales, spatial and temporal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; preferred branches of development reveal themselves.  Transhumanism</i><br>
should<br>
<i>&gt; be aiming at maximizing chances of successful speciation by learning</i><br>
where<br>
<i>&gt; these preferred branches are located.  I like the idea of defining</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism as an "idea" because it avoids getting bogged down in</i><br>
<i>&gt; prescriptive or normative ethics, i.e., it doesn't come across as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "program" or a utopian manifesto.  Optionally, you might bring in some</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept wedded to "adventure," something relating to the vitality of</i><br>
<i>&gt; pursuing enhanced consciousness and indefinite longevity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The inclusion of "a life affirming way" naturally excludes enthusiasts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; abortion, infanticide and euthanasia since these are all life devaluing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not affirming.  Freedom to murder is not liberty, it's license.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; enthusiasts, who sanction predatory behavior against the weak, the sick </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If, by "enthusiasts of abortion, infanticide and euthanasia" you mean<br>
those who support the right for the women to decide individually whether<br>
she should continue a pregnancy and those who believe that each person<br>
has the right to decide that his or her existence must not continue, then<br>
I contend that those people are not "naturally excluded."  Your emotions<br>
have greatly confused your ability to discern between those who support a<br>
right to an action or a procedure and those who seek to expand its<br>
application(s).<br>
<p>
I do not believe in using abortion as a means of birth control.  Imagine<br>
there is a young woman who cannot possibly support, nurture, and provide<br>
the happiness that the new life she helped to create should have.  I am<br>
not going to stop her from using an "artificial miscarriage"  I would<br>
rather have one unhappy person weeping for the child that could never be<br>
in her reality, than to have two unhappy people as the child grows into a<br>
world that it comes to despise because it is not happy.<br>
<p>
<p>
and<br>
<i>&gt; the old, who adhere to the "might makes right" ethic of entropic</i><br>
<i>&gt; death-worship, are essentially ape-like thugs who aim no higher than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; next tree branch up in a fetid jungle.  They may masquerade as</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanists or extropians, but they live an ugly lie, incoherently and</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrationally posturing as if they "affirm life" and mouthing vapid</i><br>
<i>&gt; platitudes about "non-coercion" while forcing everyone to tolerate their</i><br>
<i>&gt; endorsement and practice of butchery.</i><br>
<p>
What is affirming life?  I take this phrase to mean more than affirming<br>
an individual life.  Life can refer to the general human condition, for<br>
which the extropians and transhumanists stand to improve.  If refusing to<br>
stop abortion improves the general human condition, which includes the ~6<br>
billion beings already in existence, by reducing the number of unhappy<br>
people, then those who "live an ugly lie" are in effect promoting life<br>
affirmation.<br>
<p>
Reilly, you are the person who wishes to force your beliefs and your<br>
truths upon everyone else.  By saying that others are trying to make you<br>
tolerate says that because you do not tolerate those beliefs, they should<br>
not be allowed to continue.  THAT is forcing beliefs on others.  Ask<br>
yourself, Reilly, what is your true goal?  Do you not think that there<br>
are already enough unhappy people in the world?  Why refuse individuals<br>
from stopping the development of another few undifferentiated cells into<br>
an unhappy person?  <br>
<p>
I personally believe that abortion, particularly late-term, should be<br>
avoided at all costs, unless there are dire circumstances, such as the<br>
threat to a woman's life.  People should ideally, to me, determine that<br>
they can support a child before they proceed to do so, or they should<br>
preempt the problem by simply using effective birth control.  A pregnant<br>
woman should also be able to determine long before the fetus becomes<br>
viable whether she should continue.  However, I am not a woman, and I<br>
cannot speak for everyone.  Nobody can.  <br>
