   IAN: As an analogy: just as a day has a <br>
   dark side and a light side, you have an <br>
   inside and an outside, and just as the <br>
   identity of a day contains both sides, <br>
   your identity contains both your inside <br>
   and outside. The equivalence is not that <br>
   your outside is the same as your inside <br>
   (that would eliminate difference, the <br>
   basis of relational identity), it's <br>
   that your outside is an equally <br>
   necessary feature of your identity.<br>
<p>
   If we ask, "To be A, does A need A more<br>
   than A needs -A?" we find that A needs A<br>
   to a degree that is the same as (=) -A.<br>
   If we ask, "Is A as large as -A?" and <br>
   we find -A is larger, we say A has a<br>
   size that is not the same as (=/=) -A.<br>
<p>
   So the A = -A statement defines one <br>
   aspect of A, its identity structure,<br>
   a very big aspect of A! We can also <br>
   find this equality in the second ques-<br>
   tion that returned a "A =/= -A" answer<br>
   by asking "To be large, does the large<br>
   need large as much as it needs small?"<br>
   we will find that the large needs the <br>
   small for the large to be large to a <br>
   degree that is the same as (=) its <br>
   need for the large, so here L = -L.<br>

<i>&gt;	Given that the universe can be defined in terms of its</i><br>

<p>

   IAN: Taking holism to a numerical level<br>
   (expressed in zero mechanics) we find <br>
   that identity is conserved, and it follows <br>
   from this that identities in natures, which <br>
   include all the physical forces, are like-<br>
   wise conserved, because every X is merely <br>
   a derivative of -X, and every measure of <br>
   1 unit of X is derived by deviation from<br>
   0, and the 0,1 identity relation is sym-<br>
   metrical, meaning that 0 is as much smaller<br>
   than 1 (-1) as 1 is larger (+1) than 0 and <br>
   the entire relation sums back to 0. It <br>
   follows therefore that no measure exceeds <br>
   0, where 0 = (n + (-n)), and this conserva-<br>
   tion of identity tells us just about every-<br>
   thing about everything in the universe.<br>
<p>
   If we knew only the holistic identity<br>
   theory and zero mechanics, we could pre-<br>
   dict major factors of the structure of <br>
   the universe prior to encountering it, <br>
   because ultimately everything is relative <br>
   and holism defines relational structure.<br>
<p>
   Of course I don't purport to have proven<br>
   absolutely that nothing in the universe <br>
   deviates from zero mechanics but hope <br>
   people will test it has strongly as <br>
   they consider it may be true. <br>
