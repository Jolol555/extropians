<i>&gt; Com'n, Michael.  Name me one civilization in which there</i><br>
<i>&gt; was a similar level of invention as there currently is in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; present day, *period*!  This isn't a matter of patent protection,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the scientific method, and books.</i><br>
<p>
The scientific method developed  in the Renaissance period in response to the<br>
beginnings of patent law in the city states of europe, where princes, Doge's<br>
etc. needed a policy which would encourage inventive individuals to commit to<br>
selling new technologies for weapons of war only to a single Sovereign. The<br>
Patent protected legally the inventor from being litterally 'screwed' in the<br>
sovereigns dungeons in order to keep the technology secret. Remember, this<br>
was a time when guns were beginning to become available, as well as cannon,<br>
etc., a revolution in miltary technology was underway due to the competition<br>
between the city states and principalities on the battle field. One of the<br>
best known of these inventors was Leonardo Da Vinci, who had to develop a<br>
secret code system in which he became so fluent that he could write by hand<br>
while viewing his text through a mirror in order to maintain the security of<br>
his workbooks.<br>
<p>
The scientific method followed later as a method of scientific discovery and<br>
experimentation merely to make a more efficient system for research than the<br>
existing hit and miss system of guesswork.<br>
<p>
I htink that it would be safe to say that we owe both the concept of<br>
intellectual property and the scientific method to one invention that<br>
preceded them: gunpowder.<br>
