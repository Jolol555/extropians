I think you have misunderstood what I'm saying here.  *Of course* I didn't<br>
`throw out' birthdays, etc.  But I knew in advance from many decades of<br>
psych tests on college kds etc, and from previous psi studies, that<br>
populations don't free-respond literally *at random*.  In the 1930s, Zenith<br>
Radio in the USA ran a long series of ESP tests that asked people to mark a<br>
sequence of binary choices and mail them in.  They got many tens of<br>
thousands of answers,  When these were compiled and analysed (rather<br>
witlessly, but psych stats was young then), they announced to a stunned<br>
world that ESP had been proved beyond doubt.  There was a quite startling<br>
correspondence between the collective answers and the targets.  <br>
<p>
Then someone smarter noticed what is now obvious - that in almost every<br>
week's responses, there had been a joint tendency for people to generate<br>
the sequence 11211 (I think it was).  If the choice was Black/White, people<br>
en masse tended to choose White White Black White White, say.  When all<br>
this stuff was screened for such templates and biases, and the randomly<br>
generated target arrays matched up, it turned out that by chance there had<br>
been slightly rather more target sequences compatible with that format than<br>
not.  Worse, subtle cueing meant that people were sometimes led to start<br>
their guesses with one target rather than the other, which then entrained<br>
the rest of the sequence.  And so on.  At a stroke, the evidence for ESP in<br>
the Zenith data vanished, to relieved guffaws from the skeptics.<br>
<p>
Forty years later I came along and went through it again, using a rather<br>
denuded data base (the original data had been lost, and all that's on<br>
record is the total number of guesses for each week and the standard<br>
deviation scores for each target, from which one can reconstruct a rude<br>
profile of the true guesses.  When one edits out the underlying and<br>
repeated 11211 pattern, something quite interesting emerges.  It is now<br>
obvious that something *was* going on.  Put it another way - people will<br>
always collectively choose White in the first place, but the vote is two<br>
percent higher (say) when White *was* the target than when it wasn't.<br>
<p>
I have never published these results, because they are post hoc and too<br>
grainy to be truly interesting.  But it showed me that when I came to look<br>
at Lotto, I shouldn't go searching for, say, the 6 largest votes out of 45<br>
each draw, taking that as the majority vote.  If I'd done that, I'd have<br>
got pretty much the same 6 each week, because people collectively select 7<br>
1.209 times as often as they might if there were no bias, 13 is chosen<br>
1.215 times too often, 20 scores 1.247 higher; while 41 only gets 0.634<br>
times as much of the vote as it ought, 43 gets 0.784, and so on.  All this<br>
would wash out automatically  if I'd had a very large number of draws to<br>
work with, but in fact in my pool of data some numbers came up as winners,<br>
by chance, more often than others. (The numbers produced by the game<br>
randomiser do *not* correlate with the population preferences, so that<br>
stands as powerful evidence *against* any collective psychokinetic or<br>
mind-over-matter effects in such games.)<br>
<p>
The answer is obvious: don't compare 7's vote with 41's, but 7-when-it-wins<br>
with 7-when-it-loses.<br>
<p>
That's all I was talking about.  No data or animals were harmed in the<br>
course of this experiment.<br>
