  We live in exciting times. IMHO, I think there is a possibility that<br>
death from cancer may become a thing of the past during the next couple<br>
of decades, with either endostatin/angiostatin or some other therapy.<br>
  I also suspect that combination therapies including potassium may be<br>
effective in preventing, if not curing cardiovascular disease. The results<br>
with potassium treatment of stroke-prone rodents are hard to believe.<br>
Super high blood pressures, and little or no organ damage or mortality.<br>
(Journal of Hypertension 2(Sup 3): 363-366 1984) EG: SHRSP rats mortality<br>
reduced from 83% to 2%, and Dahl S rats from 55% to 4% with additional<br>
potassium.<br>
  I think many of us would-be life-extenders may have ignored the fact<br>
that curing or preventing various diseases is a much easier task than<br>
eliminating aging itself and that it is the former that is an absolute<br>
prerequisite to a significantly increased life span. Even if aging is<br>
completely prevented, little increase in human life spans may result if<br>
plaque build-up in arteries is not also slowed.<br>
  Indeed I suspect this may be the general reason why aminoguanidine seems<br>
to be ineffective in increasing life span in rodents, despite from all<br>
appearances being successful in slowing down the aging process. These<br>
animals die primarily from cancer, and even a successful anti-aging<br>
intervention is not going to increase their life span, if it does not<br>
reduce tumor growth. Ironically aminoguanidine is effective in preventing<br>
cardiovascular and renal pathology, so it might be effective in extending<br>
human life spans, even it does not benefit cancer prone rodents. (Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. 93: 3902-3907 1996)<br>
   I suspect the good results from caloric restriction in rodents may<br>
not be primarily due to any putative anti-aging effect, but instead is due<br>
directly to an anti-tumor effect. There is experimental data to support<br>
this. (Mechanisms of Ageing and Development 92: 67-82 1996)<br>
   To sum-up eliminating the primary diseases responsible for mortality is<br>
a necessary precursor to significantly extended life spans.<br>
