ROTFL.  Sorry, my tone of voice obviously doesn't translate to ASCII<br>

Ian, I wasn't referring to your theory but to your obsessive need to<br>
relate it to everything you say.  Almost every post you make manages<br>
to turn the subject into some off-hand remark about "A equals not -A."<br>
 And how those people with their "goofy" ideas label you a "crackpot."<br>
 Maybe your ideas haven't been given a fair chance but do you really<br>
have to resort to forcing them on us?  Do you really think the sort of<br>
pompous grandstanding you so frequently display will make people take<br>
you seriously?<br>
<p>
You may have noticed that when I "Yaked miserably against truth as the<br>
goal of inquiry" I did not repeatedly bring the subject up in separate<br>
posts.  Not once did I say, "well thinking that automation will lead<br>
to unemployment is almost as bad as those people who think truth is<br>
the ultimate goal of science."  To be honest I find your form of<br>
"debate" offensive, much more offensive than the colourful use of<br>
language that I so elegantly displayed.<br>
<p>
I'm not at all opposed to truth and inquiry.  You turned that<br>
particular post (on the dangers of presenting scientific truth as<br>
absolute) into another of your "identity theory" crusades.  Many of<br>
the posts I make to this list are simply ideas, most of the time<br>
they're wrong.  Sometimes I'll post a great idea and someone will<br>
dismiss it without thought, but why become so obsessed with proving<br>
them wrong?  Focus your attention on your theory, not it's opposition.<br>
<p>
--Wax<br>
<p>
P.S. Please don't take this as an attack on your person, just some<br>
constructive criticism (I hope).  And, if it sounds deadly serious<br>
(i.e. temper tantrum) please forgive me.<br>
