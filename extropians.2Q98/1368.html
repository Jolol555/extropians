<i>&gt;        &gt;input (sensations), but also relates to them by, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;remembering them, associating them with other sensations, combining,</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;analyzing, observing, and/or processing them in any of a variety of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;ways, then that complex system of relations might constitute</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;sentience (or consciousness).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's easy to prove that any computer can "remember", "associate" and "analyze"</i><br>
<i>&gt;input data.</i><br>
<p>
Not without the help of a computer operator.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That only leaves "observing", but that means placing input data</i><br>
<i>&gt;into consciousness so it's no help in defining consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
Defining consciousness presents a special problem, no doubt about it. Why not ask you computer to<br>
define it?<br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;It still remains possible to differentiate between intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;sentience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How? What test could you possibly perform on someone to make this distinction?</i><br>
<p>
Test yourself. See if you can sustain consciousness while doing nothing whatever of an intelligent<br>
nature.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;highly intelligent entities may completely lack sentience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've been asking this question for years on this list but have never received</i><br>
<i>&gt;an answer, if what you say is true what's the  point of sentience?</i><br>
<p>
Sentience requires no "point" or other teleological approach. Sentience has no purpose or intention.<br>
Cosmic consciousness, according to some who claim to have experienced it, resides at the peak of<br>
human experience. I don't think any kind of test can reveal the presence of sentience. But the<br>
desire to test for it may indicate a lack of total awareness. Maybe it takes one to know one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Intelligence has survival value,</i><br>
<p>
In some worlds, perhaps so. But it depends on your definition of intelligence. Viruses seem quite<br>
robust, yet they don't demonstrate any equivalent intelligence to that of say, the average<br>
extropian.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but if the two are unrelated why would</i><br>
<p>
Who said they were unrelated? I wrote that it is possible to differentiate between the two.<br>
Intelligence operates convergently, whereas consciousness seems to expand with divergent movement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;random mutation and natural selection bother to make anything sentient?</i><br>
<p>
It may turn out that life indeed finds sentience to be an unprofitable experiment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me it would be like a fifth wheel, and yet I know for a fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution did bother to make at least one thing conscious.</i><br>
<p>
There you go again. You say no test exists to determine consciousness, yet you claim that it<br>
nevertheless exists.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
