They're no different from any other ancient character, they can be judged by  <br>
the historical record and by nothing else, the real person could have been  <br>
better or worse, and I don't claim to know what anything is *really* like,  <br>

That doesn't follow. Yes, they must have had charisma and been good at public <br>
speaking, but a talent for serious rational debate is not the ticket to fame <br>
fortune or power.<br>

Christ was a jerk. I refer to the character portrayed in the bible, whether <br>
there really was a historic figure who impressed the rubes with card tricks <br>
and other stunts I don't know. Personally I'd be a lot more impressed if he <br>
had taught us about the second law of thermodynamics rather than hear a <br>
report of questionable accuracy about some water into wine trick. It took the <br>
human race another 1800 years to learn about entropy and although it teaches <br>
us nothing about morality neither do Christ's stunts, and unlike the  <br>
fermented grape juice bit you can't fake thermodynamics.<br>
<p>
Christ was a nut, nutty as a fruit cake, or to put it in more politically <br>
correct language, he had a mental illness that produced delusions of granger. <br>
I don't think it was an act, I think he really thought he was God.<br>
<p>
Christ was a martinet. His words "You serpents, you generation of vipers, how <br>
can you escape the damnation of hell" sounds more like a typical flame you <br>
can find anywhere on the net then it does the wisdom of a great sage. Buddha, <br>
Lao-tse, and Socrates all had a much more enlightened attitude toward those <br>
who disagreed with them, and they had it 500 years before Jesus.<br>
<p>
Christ was a creep. He believed in hell, he talked with glee about "wailing <br>
and gnashing of teeth" and "these shall go away into everlasting fire". <br>
He thought that torturing somebody, not for a billion years, but for an <br>
INFINITE number of years would be an amusing thing to do to somebody he <br>
didn't like. I think  cruelty on this monstrous scale proves that Christ of <br>
the bible is morally indistinguishable from Satin of the bible. <br>
<p>
Strong words but I don't believe I'm engaging in hyperbole, imagine for a  <br>
moment what it would be like if a Christian God did exist. Here we have an <br>
all powerful demon addicted to flattery who can read your every thought and <br>
will torture you, not for a long time, but for ETERNITY if you take one step <br>
out of line or break just one of his many, many, rules and they includes <br>
thought crimes. To make maters worse you're not even sure exactly what all <br>
his rules are, the "experts" violently disagree, so you never know if you're <br>
going to be tortured or how to avoid it. This seems pretty  depressing to me <br>
and not at all moral, I'll take an indifferent universe  over a sadistic one <br>
any day.<br>
<p>
I'll close with a quotation from Charles Darwin, a better man than the son of <br>
God even if you ignore his enormous scientific ability. I would certainly much <br>
rather have Darwin as my next door neighbor than a vindictive pompous ass <br>
like Jesus Christ.  <br>
<p>
In spite of the objections of his very religious, but loving wife, he wrote  <br>
in his 1876  autobiography :<br>
             <br>
        "Disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but at last was                <br>
         complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have                 <br>
         never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion                 <br>
         was correct. I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish      <br>
         Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text                 <br>
         seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would               <br>
         include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be         <br>
         everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine." <br>
                                   <br>
