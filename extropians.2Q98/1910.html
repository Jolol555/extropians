&lt;&lt; Add to that the fact that many of us consider<br>
 ourselves atheists (or militant agnostics!) and we see that, as usual, the<br>
 lie does more harm than good.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Count me in the first category.    I agree with the negative connotation about<br>
religions, but am also concerned about another issue :      Except possibly<br>
under freedom of religion, where else is a person's right to chose their<br>
matter of "burial" (or should we say post-mortem storeage) protected ?<br>
Under Orthodox Jewish law, for example, a person is supposed to be burried<br>
within 24 hours of death, and autopsies are forbidden.    If I'm not mistaken,<br>
in most cases I recall, this religious practise has generally been protected<br>
by the state. - -   I received a letter from a fellow who lives in Japan<br>
mentioning that he found out if he wished to be frozen and shipped back to<br>
America, his body would have to be held over for a great deal of time and for<br>
whatever reason and paperwork) and as I recall, cryopreservation is virtually<br>
illegal in Japan.   (Most States and Countries have laws about how and when<br>
bodies are to be "disposed" of.)    On the other hand, Japanese beurocrats are<br>
notoriously for making exceptions when it comes to grey areas if the proper<br>
people intervene.     (I am not a lawyer or expert in American or Japanese<br>
law, so will stop at this point until I get myself entangled in something I<br>
don't fully know what I'm talking about.)<br>
<p>
In conclusion, agreed : Honesty and ethics are important.    Public image of a<br>
growing movement is also important.   I can't deny that.  - -  I forget the<br>
author of a famous freethought treatist written in the late 19th century<br>
entitled "A History of the Warfare Between Science and Theology" - -<br>
ironically, that battle continues 100 years later, as we see in issues related<br>
to cloning to the right to die.   Ironically, both touch quite close to home.<br>
However, as what one might call "Life Insurance", unless you can point out to<br>
one area that privates me a legal right to chose my matter of de-animation,<br>
and a right to be frozen and remain frozen, I would half to play it from both<br>
sides of the fence...   (incidently, I believe in law, this is known as<br>
"creation of a legal fiction" -- a pre-contrived action or agreement which<br>
allows for a grey area of the law to be supported in a person's favor.)<br>
