I agree that vastly increased information flows will facilitate improved<br>
control of environmental through-put management (to coin a bureaucratic-<br>
sounding term).  However, I remain somewhat skeptical of proposals that<br>
complete recycling of industrial waste can be economical with near-term energy<br>
and manufacturing techniques, simply because of energy inefficiencies.  <br>
<p>
I think many current "green" proposals for industrial waste recycling are<br>
fundamentally wrong-headed because the energy input necessary to recycle<br>
ultimately CAUSES more pollution: The energy necessary to accomplish them<br>
increases the hydrocarbon load on the environment.  Thus, simply burying the<br>
waste in question is ultimately better for the environment because it is the<br>
lesser of the two evils.<br>
<p>
Improved information systems WILL allow a more informed choice on these<br>
questions, though, since the energy load for any particular process ought to<br>
be a matter of "micro-accounting" that will allow the actors involved to<br>
calculate the economic and ecological costs and benefits of any proposed<br>
waste-recycling transaction or chain of transactions.<br>
