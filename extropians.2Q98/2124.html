 The polymath has had much more influence on my ideas in the past 6 months<br>
than the extropians list had over the past 2 years.<br>
 For example, I used to be pretty sure that nanotech and AI would cause<br>
a big, long-lasting increase in interest rates; I now think that the<br>
increase will be moderate and temporary.<br>
<p>
 Unfortunately, most of the changes in my ideas are due to one person<br>
(Robin Hanson), so it is somewhat accurate to call the list inbred. I<br>
don't see an easy way to get more people of Robin's calibur on the list,<br>
and I suspect that opening the list would mainly cause the list to be<br>
more dominated by familiar ideas. The extropians list has become ordinary<br>
enough that I've virtually given up looking for important new ideas on it.<br>
