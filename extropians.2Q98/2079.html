<p>
this does not mean that the virus would be activated just by sticking it<br>
into the floppy drive.  The virus protection software you are running is<br>
running all the time i guess (background in windows, and as a TSR in dos),<br>
and when you stick the disk in the drive and the boot sector is read, the<br>
virus protection detects the virus in the disk.<br>
The virus does not need to run for the virus protection software to detect<br>
it (in fact, if it runs, it's too late).  Try the experiment.  grab an old<br>
hard drive you don't need, stick the disk in the floppy, take it out, and<br>
then check if the virus is in the hard drive.  I bet you 99-1 that it is<br>
not.  <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, if you want a copy of this virus, all you have to do is exchange files over</i><br>
<i>&gt; the internet with anyone on a PC at Sturm Ruger, Inc. Their entire network is</i><br>
<i>&gt; infested with it, or was the last I heard. Be sure to have your antivirus</i><br>
<i>&gt; software on when you receive it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The only way to get a boot sector virus,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; outside executing an executable with a virus, is to boot from a floppy, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which case the disk's boot sector gets loaded by the BIOS and executed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is the reason why boot sector virii are almost extincts since the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; need to boot from floppy is extinct.  Same as above holds for CDs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Reading data cannot heart, executing it does.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was under the impression that the Stealth C variant virus I have on a disk is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a boot sector virus. If stealth viruses are not boot sector types, please let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; know....</i><br>
<p>
i think that the stealth virus you've got is a boot sector virus, but<br>
AFAIK, not all stealth virii are, by definition, boot sector virii.<br>
