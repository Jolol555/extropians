Right, Natasha. Many people think that scientists use a purely<br>
rational method, the "scientific method", to solve problems and<br>
somehow generate scientific knowledge. I feel that scientists<br>
actually operate by first generating a whole bunch of ideas<br>
by non-rational processes, and then pick some of them for further<br>
analysis. A creative scientist probabpy generates between ten and<br>
a hundred such ideas a day, and picks between one and ten of them<br>
for further analysis. Of these, most are discarded base on simple<br>
"thought experiments", within a few seconds. Perhaps one a week<br>
actually gets more than one minute of careful thought. Of these,<br>
perhaps one per month gets written down. Some of these may then<br>
be formally subjected to the scientific method.<br>
<p>
The difference between science and other human endeavors is that<br>
the creative process is finally subjected to rational, reproducable<br>
analysis before it is accepted.<br>
