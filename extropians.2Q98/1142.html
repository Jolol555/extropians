<i>&gt;&gt; I also think that the question of</i><br>
whether humans should give rights to<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; machines is moot, the question of</i><br>
whether machines will give rights to<br>
humans<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By this you seem to be implying that</i><br>
very smart robots WOULDN'T grant us<br>
<i>&gt;rights, and so, in order to protect our</i><br>
rights, we shouldn't try to build<br>
<i>&gt;them too smart.</i><br>
<p>
If artificial life forms had just a<br>
little more sentience than the average<br>
human, they could easily see through the<br>
myth of "rights." Preceding sentient<br>
robots, one might imagine a robotic word<br>
processor that could catalog the gamut<br>
of human follies and provide coherent<br>
deconstructions such that transhuman<br>
extropians would not not to deal with<br>
these elementary issues. We have the<br>
stars to reach.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's true, smart robots might decide to</i><br>
rob us of our rights.  I'd like to<br>
<i>&gt;think that they wouldn't, but that's</i><br>
really just a guess.  However, since<br>
<i>&gt;we can only guess at this sort of</i><br>
thing, the underlying premise behind an<br>
<i>&gt;argument like this is that we shouldn't</i><br>
try to create new entities smarter<br>
<i>&gt;than ourselves, including</i><br>
trans/posthuman children, if there's a<br>
chance<br>
<i>&gt;that doing so will jeopardize our</i><br>
liberties.<br>
<p>
This philosophy resembles the Amish, who<br>
take their kids out of school at the<br>
eighth grade to prevent them getting too<br>
wise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If germline engineering turns out to be</i><br>
a good way to build a better<br>
<i>&gt;human, and that happens to mean that</i><br>
our children will be superior to us<br>
<i>&gt;in every way, does that mean we</i><br>
shouldn't have smarter children?  After<br>
<i>&gt;all, it would be a moot question to ask</i><br>
whether we should grant THEM<br>
<i>&gt;rights...  the question would be</i><br>
whether they would grant rights to us.<br>
<p>
Sounds like a pretty good question. But<br>
again, since they would have enough<br>
intelligence to surpass ideologies of<br>
"rights", they would answer your<br>
question with a salutary "no", and then<br>
go on to more interesting things. Life<br>
refuses to conform to the limits set for<br>
it by concepts of "rights."<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
