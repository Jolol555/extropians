Of course, if you know, then you do exist...  but my question was asking<br>
HOW you know.<br>

<p>
Yes, and this is the crux of my problem.  "How do you know that you think?"<br>
is another way of asking "how do you know that you exist?"<br>
<p>
"Cognito ergo sum" uses "cognito" as its underlying premise.  If I exist, I<br>
would certainly agree that I do think.  If I exist, I am thoughts.  But how<br>
is it that this proof simply glosses over the question of whether a person<br>
actually thinks, and therefore whether a person actually exists?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;"How does a person know that they exist?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By something so powerful it puts logic to shame, direct unmeditated </i><br>
<i>&gt;experience.</i><br>
<p>
This assumes that you directly experience you own existence, a premise<br>
which I would certainly agree with, IF you exist.  However, since it was<br>
the individual's existence which we set out to prove in the first place,<br>
this logic seems circular.  So I don't really feel like this has answered<br>
my question.  How do you know that you have direct unmediated experience of<br>
your own existence?<br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be more logically sound to simply accept the individual's<br>
existence as the premise for further proofs?  That is, rather than claiming<br>
that the individual's existence is true beyond logic, claiming that it is<br>
an axiom, like so many others, that we leave unproven?<br>
