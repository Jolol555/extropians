<p>
I agree that this cost would be born...  I said that we have little to<br>
lose, not nothing to lose.  However, there is much, much more to be gained.<br>
 The degree to which this system is "attainable" is currently the subject<br>
of debate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They are both likely to be false due the same reason: you prefer the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;PPA because you are going to pay less than you do now,</i><br>
<p>
Not at all!  In this particular case, I prefer the other PPA because it<br>
isn't TYRANNICAL, remember?  I think it's safe to presume that I'm prepared<br>
to pay at least as much as I'd pay a tyrannical PPA in exchange for my<br>
freedom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;which means that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the potential profit for that other PPA is lower than the current profit</i><br>
<i>&gt;of your current PPA,</i><br>
<p>
Once I have made the decision to switch PPAs, my current PPA gets no profit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;which means that your current PPA will spend more</i><br>
<i>&gt;money keeping you than the other PPA will in trying to "free" you.</i><br>
<p>
If I'm prepared to spend more money for a more liberal PPA, this whole<br>
argument goes straight out the window.<br>
