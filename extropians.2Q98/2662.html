<i>&gt; &gt; Heinlein once had a character remark that "one can bask in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; warmth of religion, or stand in the cold light of reason." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       No! NO!  This view so many rationalists and extropians and</i><br>
<i>&gt; people like you take is so infuriating to me.  To me this is such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lie and so many extropians and others are just playing into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious fundamentalist's hands by regurgitating it.</i><br>
<p>
I originally filtered this meme as a keeper.  After reading your reply<br>
and re-filtering, I realized I originally registered "cold light of<br>
reason" sarcastically.  That is, I knew full well it is really warmer<br>
than can be imagined.  Now, realizing this meme would not propagate<br>
through most minds the same way - I agree, it should be trashed.  I am<br>
now more aware that most memes should be filtered by running a<br>
simulation of how they propagate through most minds rather than just<br>
my own.  Thanks for increasing my awareness. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; die to get to heaven!  You Live!  Our minds are so polluted and</i><br>
<i>&gt; twisted with so much blatant irrationality!  It is our mortal</i><br>
<i>&gt; ancestors that lived their short lives that we might live better and</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer ones!  They are the ones that lived to gave us everything we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have including our lives.  Soon, because of what our ancestors have</i><br>
<i>&gt; given us and by our living, we will be able to give to our children</i><br>
<i>&gt; immortal lives.  We are the ones doing the work, making real</i><br>
<i>&gt; sacrifices, and creating heaven for our children!  And the heaven we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are creating will eventually be a naturally real heaven unimaginably</i><br>
<i>&gt; better than all the contradictory, incomprehensible, neither world</i><br>
<i>&gt; heavens ever described and claimed by the many religions which are</i><br>
<i>&gt; really all hells at best.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks for saying aloud what I've been thinking to myself for so long.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       If you honestly think about it, even in the "cold light of</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason" there can be the possibility or hope of a resurrection.  How</i><br>
<i>&gt; can any truly rational person deny the possibility that after another</i><br>
<i>&gt; billion years of the continued progress which we have seen so far,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that our children will not eventually evolve to be true Gods that</i><br>
<i>&gt; finally discover some way to resurrect all people that have ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; lived?  </i><br>
<p>
The gods are the descendants of our ancestors.  They may not exist in<br>
our space-time but thay may exist in our space or time.  Your view on<br>
resurrection above does not mix well with the principle of dynamic<br>
optimism.  All we have to do is sit back and have faith.  But<br>
enlightened faith is infinitely better than blind faith.  I think<br>
every time you have used this word it has refered to the former.  But<br>
isnt enlightened faith close to being an oxymoron?  As extropians<br>
treading the head waters at the deep end of the meme pool, having<br>
completed our defiant adaptive walk through the rugged memetic fitness<br>
landscape (sorry, couldn't help mixing metaphors within the same<br>
sentence) we now sit high on a peak of local maxima.  But we see the<br>
horizon beyond the fitness deserts all around us and we know the<br>
engine of spontaneous order will deliver us to that higher peak.  Does<br>
this mean we have faith in reaching that peak, or just an understanding<br>
via forethought of its inevitable existence?<br>
<p>
A month or two ago, I tried to start a thread called "PIP-tech" that<br>
applied the principle of dynamic optimism to the idea of future<br>
resurrection.  I was hoping to spark an idea in some of the space-time<br>
engineering types on this list but to no avail.  I'm sorry I do not<br>
have the inclination to develop the idea further.<br>
