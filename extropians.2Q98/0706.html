While I agree with your other comments on this thread, I don't agree here.<br>
"Atheism" = a-theism. Since "theism" means a belief in a god, "atheism" is<br>
the absence of belief in a god. In that sense, I am an atheist. An atheist<br>
*may* actively deny that there is a god of any particular description, and<br>
may even claim that they can prove that there is no god. However, that is<br>
not the essence of atheism. The essence is simply the absence of belief.<br>
<p>
I would not call myself an agnostic, since I do think that knowledge of<br>
these things is possible. If you define "god" in some clear enough way --<br>
the standard sense being a single being who is omnipotent, omniscience, and<br>
all-good, then I would say I know there is no such being. "Know" here is<br>
contextual and not absolute -- but that's always the case with knowledge.<br>
<p>
I would take the same position if someone claimed that an invisible,<br>
intangible elf lived on top of the Empire State Building, where it<br>
controlled the minds of the heads of state. Since there is zero evidence<br>
for such a belief, and any predictions such a beliefs makes are going to be<br>
either unfalsifiable or plain wrong, I would reject that belief. I would be<br>
an atheist (or an a-elfist) not an agnostic (or ag-elfist)! That doesn't<br>
mean I claim that I can definitely prove that there is no such elf.<br>
<p>
Atheistically yours,<br>
