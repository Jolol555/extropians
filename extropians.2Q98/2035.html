  Some of Dan's counters I've not properly <br>
  addressed by not clearly defining holism.<br>
  Mapping the holistic structure of identity <br>
  is deep, and a complex effort. The source <br>
  of conflict is the mechanics of notion.<br>
<p>
  When we say "A" we denote the inside of A.<br>
  When we say "-A" we denote the outside of A.<br>
  When we say "A + -A" we denote the union of<br>
  the inside and the outside of A. The later <br>
  expression of union is NOT equal to the two<br>
  former expressions. A shortfall of my case<br>
  has been the failure to denote that differ-<br>
  ence. Doing so, the logical expression of <br>
  holistic identity structure is achieved.<br>
<p>
  As the identity structure of A (the state <br>
  of reality that makes A = A) contains both <br>
  A and -A, the singular notation of "A" is <br>
  incomplete as a means of denoting identity <br>
  structure. The holism I attempt to define <br>
  accurately is simply the process of noting <br>
  that to define the identity structure of <br>
  A requires that we denote both A and -A.<br>
<p>
  Out of habit, I've still been saying <br>
  "A = A + -A" (even as I've improved this <br>
  a few months ago), which is an unclear and <br>
  inaccurate means of denoting the holistic <br>
  identity structure of A. The problem is <br>
  that the first "A" denotes MORE than the <br>
  second "A." This then is the improved <br>
  and correct notation of holism:<br>
<p>
  (super)A = (in)A + (out)A<br>
<p>
  Or we could say: A = +A + -A, where the <br>
  unsigned A implies the union of in and out.<br>
  (Super)A is the set that contains all that <br>
  defines the identity of (in)A. If we wish <br>
  to define the structure of identity, this<br>
  is the proper notation. If we want to de-<br>
  note only one aspect of the identity stru-<br>
  cture of A, then we only denote that aspect,<br>
  but that dose NOT denote identity structure,<br>
  only the part of it we want to talk about,<br>
  and that's what communication is about. But<br>
  if we want to know who we get those things <br>
  that we talk about, we need to define holism.<br>
<p>
  The argument that (super)A is not a meaning-<br>
  ful or useful way of defining A may or may<br>
  not be true, however, that commentary is<br>
  beside the point. The goal of scientific<br>
  inquiry is the map the structure of what <br>
  is, and identity is, and a mapping of the <br>
  identity of A that fails to denote the <br>
  mechanics of the entire superstructure of<br>
  A is a mapping that is NOT the whole truth.<br>
  I believe that the whole truth is the true<br>
  and deepest goal of scientific inquiry. <br>

  knowledge of the eternal, and not of aught<br>
  perishing and transient." Plato, The Republic.<br>
