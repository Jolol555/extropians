I agree. Laws are *usually* special interest giveaways or prohibitions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Copyrights do nothing but reward duplication and mediocrity at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the expense of true creativity and artistry.  Patents do nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;but reward pointless novelty at the expense of workmanship and</i><br>
<i>&gt;quality.  Writers and inventors should not be afraid of losing</i><br>
<i>&gt;their jobs to their abolition--they should cheer for losing their</i><br>
<i>&gt;jobs, and being freed to use their talents more profitably in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a thousand other ways that the laws have stifled for too long.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Here I have a problem. How exactly doesw my having a copyright or patent<br>
prevent you from developing your own unique copyrightable or patentable<br>
product? These laws have no effect on creativity, except possibly in the<br>
area of discovering ways to make a patented thing faster or better than the<br>
patent owner can..<br>
<p>
I will agree that the existing patent laws (which are flaunted by<br>
organizations like NASA who patent many public domain devices and also<br>
software) must be thrown out and rewritten with a free market in mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your argument, like many others in this subject, is in the form</i><br>
<i>&gt;of "The current system has X, Y, Z, A, B, and C; and books get</i><br>
<i>&gt;published, movies are made, etc.  Without copyright, you can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;do Y and B, therefore no books will be made, no songs recorded,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and authors will beg in the streets."  Nonsense.  In a new world</i><br>
<i>&gt;without copyrights, we lose Y and B, but we gain D, E, F, P, Q,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and R, and the whole industry changes, adapts to the new model.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Writers will be no less creative, consumers will no less desire</i><br>
<i>&gt;their services, and more--not less--money will be made, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be made in very different ways that today's publishers</i><br>
<i>&gt;just don't have to brains to imagine or the courage to do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Even so, the free market will evolve protections analogous to patents and<br>
trademarks. It is inevitable that rules of some sort will be made to prevent<br>
theft and fraud.<br>
