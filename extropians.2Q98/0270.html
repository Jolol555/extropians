Thanks for sending this, Ron. I didn't respond sooner because I was really<br>
busy. LEF saw the article right away and wrote the following rebuttal- I<br>
hope to get more input on this from Dick Passwater,PhD, Mathias Rath,MD,<br>
Abram Hoffer, MD,PhD and others:<br>

Life Extension Foundation's Preliminary <br>
Rebuttal to a Recent Vitamin C Study<br>
April 9, 1998<br>
<p>
HIGH DOSES OF VITAMIN C CAUSE DAMAGE<br>
<p>
On April 8, 1998, British scientists released the results of a <br>
study showing that vitamin C was effective for cancer prevention and <br>
free radical suppression at the dose of 60 mg a day, but at 500 mg a <br>
day, it caused genetic damage that could lead to cancer or rheumatoid<br>
arthritis.<br>
<p>
The researchers gave 30 human volunteers 500 mg vitamin C supplements <br>
for six weeks. The scientists showed that while 500 mg a day produces<br>
protective effects, it also appears to have a dual activity in which <br>
it can also cause damage.<br>
<p>
Higher doses of vitamin C were shown to react with iron and other <br>
metals to damage cellular DNA.<br>
<p>
This small study help to validate The Life Extension Foundation's <br>
17-year position that vitamin C must be taken with other antioxidants <br>
like vitamin E, or the vitamin C will react with iron and copper to <br>
produce DNA-damaging free radicals.<br>
<p>
Saul Kent, President of The Life Extension Foundation, first brought <br>
out this information in 1978, when he cited animal studies showing <br>
that high doses of vitamin C, given without other antioxidants, <br>
actually shortened the life span.<br>
<p>
Most vitamin supplement users consume at least 400 iu of vitamin E, <br>
and 400 mcg of folic acid every day. The addition of these two nutrients <br>
could have prevented the iron-induced DNA damage observed by the British<br>
scientists. More specific antioxidants like n-acetyl-cysteine, grape-seed <br>
and green tea extract would provide significant protection against DNA <br>
damage induced as a result of vitamin C catalyzing with iron and copper.<br>
<p>
The British scientists did note that even at the high dose of 500 mg <br>
of vitamin C a day, it was preventing more damage than it was creating. <br>
