OK.  At my website, <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html">http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html</a> I analyze<br>
the incentive to invent.  Looking at this will make my point much clearer,<br>
but here is my analysis in sum:<br>
<p>
The benefit of IP enforcement is that it increases the incentive to<br>
invent. The incentive to invent is given by the increased revenues which<br>
an inventor receives by inventing; this value is larger under a monopoly<br>
than under competition. <br>
<p>
The cost of IP enforcement is twofold:  first, there is the actual cost of<br>
paying for police investigations, arrests, imprisonment, trials, and all<br>
of that other stuff.  I have argued that investigation would be<br>
exceptionally costly over a system like TC May's BlackNet.  I have also<br>
argued that attempting to enforce the terms of a contract on someone who<br>
has not signed the contract is economically inefficient in the long run;<br>
Lorrey argues that simply by buying an illegal copy of the good, you have<br>
implicitly agreed to the rules of "caveat emptor," accepting liability and<br>
responsibility for your purchase.<br>
<p>
Second, there is "deadweight loss" in the copy market.  Deadweight loss<br>
happens when prices are set higher than that which would be reached by<br>
perfect competition or if the quantity is lower; if the total surplus<br>
reached under perfect competition is the area below the demand curve and<br>
above the supply curve, the deadweight loss is given by the total surplus<br>
under perfect competition (the surplus we could have had) minus the area<br>
below the demand curve, above the supply curve and to the left of the<br>
quantity sold (the surplus we actually got).  Under perfect competition,<br>
there is no deadweight loss; but when you give someone a monopoly over a<br>
good, deadweight loss inevitably results.<br>
<p>
I argued that this cost alone would be larger than the benefit of IP.<br>
Since monopolies control the entire market for their good, they must lower<br>
the price of the good in order to increase sales beyond a certain value;<br>
in other words, the marginal revenue for monopolies decreases twice as<br>
fast as that for competitive firms.  This means that while monopolies will<br>
have an incentive to produce fewer products, they will still be able to<br>
charge the higher price given by the demand curve at that quantity.<br>
(Hence deadweight loss.)  More specifically, if prices were 0, then a<br>
monopolistic firm would produce only half as much as a competitive firm<br>
would; 50% of the potential market would go to deadweight loss.  I argued<br>
that since prices were not actually zero, but nonetheless quite low and<br>
nearly completely elastic, at least 40% of the copy market would be lost<br>
to economic inefficiency.<br>
<p>
I concluded on my website that if D was the deadweight loss in the copy<br>
market, M the monopolistic increase in revenues due to invention, A the<br>
competitive increase in revenues due to invention, and E the cost of<br>
enforcement, then we should eliminate IP if the costs outweighed the<br>
benefits, or if D + E &gt; M - A, or A + D + E &gt; M.<br>
<p>
This analysis is a lot clearer with graphs.  Go check out the website and<br>
see for yourself.<br>
