   IAN: And Hara Ra adheres to the "zero evidence"<br>
   school of truth, where X = true if X is supported <br>
   by zero evidence. Which is why, failing to find a<br>
   single example of A where A is A free from not-<br>
   A, he then supports that which has no evidence.<br>
<p>
   In keeping with this most illogical standard, Hara Ra<br>
   is also an member of the ad hominem school of fallacy,<br>
   adept in its methods of anti-inquiry and distraction.<br>
