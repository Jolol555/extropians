ABC News Special Report: Sex, Drugs And Consenting Adults<br>
<p>
Airdate: Tuesday, May 26, 10:00<br>

"Liberty. What does that word mean?" Those questions begin ABCNEWS<br>
Correspondent John Stossel's one-hour examination of laws against vice and<br>
immoral behavior. With roots in both Puritanism and radical individualism,<br>
America has always wrestled with the meaning and limits to freedom. In<br>
"Sex, Drugs, and Consenting Adults" Stossel talks with Americans who say<br>
that people should only be jailed if they directly harm other people's<br>
personal property. <br>
<p>
The report features the views of prostitutes, pot smokers, gamblers, ticket<br>
scalpers, euthanasia defenders, and others who feel that the law unfairly<br>
restricts what we can do with our own bodies and our own lives. Police,<br>
medical ethicists, and government officials, on the other hand, defend the<br>
laws in the name of morality, safety, and community standards. <br>
