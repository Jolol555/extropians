<p>
<p>
   IAN: I would be interested to know where you get <br>
   your definition of "atomism." I get mine from the <br>
   the classical Three Laws of Thought that define <br>
   the structure of atomist identity (in short):<br>
<p>
    1) A is A.<br>
    2) A is not both A and not-A.<br>
    3) A is either A or not-A.<br>
<p>
   This defines a clear demarkation around A that <br>
   excludes holism by 100% and thus is atomism by<br>
   100%. What definition of atomism is more exact?<br>
<p>
   Your definition of atomism desribes a meta-rela-<br>
   tion of three relations (A,B), (A,0), and (B,0) <br>
   and observes that as (A,B) changes, the other <br>
   two remain static, true! But that's NOT a defin-<br>
   tion of identity, atomist or holist, and thus <br>
   is not a standard by which the "right" or the <br>
   "wrong" defintion is to be determined. So:<br>
<p>
   * Why is "atomist identity" as defined by the 3 <br>
   Laws of Thought a "wrong" definition of atomism?<br>
<p>
   (Our disagreements revolve around definitions, <br>
   and it seems that we agree on everything else.)<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: To sum the parts is to define the whole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    The mystical experience defines the whole and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    the whole relation of A to -A. To prohibit the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    summing is to prohibit the mystical insight.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would never prohibit anyone from arithmetic;  whether to add or not to</i><br>
<i>&gt;add is a personal choice with which it is not mine to interfere.  ;) </i><br>
<i>&gt;Rather, I argued that the fact that net identity sums to 0 does not prove</i><br>
<i>&gt;mysticism; I'm fine with the summation, but find the ultimate argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;invalid.  I demonstrated that there is a non-trivial difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt;saying that 0 = 1 and that 0 + -0 + 1 + -1 = 0.  I assert that because you</i><br>
<i>&gt;do not support the statement that there is 0 difference between one and</i><br>
<i>&gt;zero that your proof is not mystical, but trivial.  That you left this</i><br>
<i>&gt;point off of your reply is telling. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I think your accusation is in error! Cutting <br>
   to the quick: here again our difference is one of <br>
   definition. Your defining "mystical" as "a statement<br>
   about LESS than all data," such as 0 = 1. Based on <br>
   that you then construct a series of matrices with <br>
   obviously illogical information and then conclude <br>
   that the "mystical" must be illogical. Yes! But<br>
   if, and only if, your definition is THE definition.<br>
<p>
   My definition of "mystical" is "a statement about <br>
   the unity of ALL data." Based upon that, I then<br>
   construct a matrix that defines ALL identities<br>
   and sums them into a statement about ALL things.<br>
<p>
   So the real question here is: Why is a definition <br>
   of "mystical" as "a statements about not-all things"<br>
   the right definition of the "mystical" ? As I said,<br>
   I think we agree on all else but two definitions.<br>
