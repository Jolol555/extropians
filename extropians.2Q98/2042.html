<p>
Maybe intelligence should be viewed at several levels. There's the<br>
personal intelligence, at which level a LOT of people seems stupid and<br>
ignorant. :-)<br>
<p>
Then theres the public, common, shared democratic intelligence where<br>
some kind of subconcoius consensus decides what is right or wrong. Where<br>
the local stupidity in an individual is leveled out by means of<br>
statistics. Like the invisible hand in the marketplace, and the<br>
selection of government in a democracy.<br>
<p>
The thing is that it is impossible to be very smart in the many areas<br>
that this world offers. How many people are really experts in things<br>
like society, technology, art, bussines, sociology, politics etc. If<br>
there's an infinite way to view things, and things to know, and we can<br>
only learn a small subset of them really well. Then we are in fact all<br>
pretty stupid aren't we? But somehow society seems to be humping along<br>
pretty ok. <br>
Probably Because we all decide from that little subset of things that we<br>
know. All those subsets probably makes for smart decisions if theres<br>
enough of them overlapping in a big population.<br>
