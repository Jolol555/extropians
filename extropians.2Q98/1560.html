<i>&gt;Hi.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I had an idea for long-range (6000+ miles) laser communication system using</i><br>
<i>&gt;(more or less) off the shelf technologies.  I am unable to find any obvious</i><br>
<i>&gt;flaw in my idea, so I was hoping for some feedback from people who may be</i><br>
<i>&gt;more knowledgeable about this than I.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Laser targeting/ranging systems, such as those used by the military, mark</i><br>
<i>&gt;their targets by detecting the laser light which is reflected off the</i><br>
<i>&gt;object being illuminated.  My idea was to use objects in geosynchronous</i><br>
<i>&gt;orbit as reflective bodies for the purpose of scattering laser light.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;ground stations would use laser pulses to send data by reflecting them off</i><br>
<i>&gt;the geosynchronous object.  A passive sensor on the receiving end would</i><br>
<i>&gt;detect the laser light that scatters off the satellite and (hopefully)</i><br>
<i>&gt;discern the bits.  In the simplest case scenario, the data communication</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be half-duplex, but more complex arrangements could be developed.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am unsure of the type of baud rate that could be accomplished this way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Path loss looks to be the biggest problem here. Scattered laser light will<br>
be WAY down in amplitude by the time it makes it back to Earth from<br>
geosynchronous orbit..<br>
<p>
If you can detect the signal once it's back on Earth, I imagine you want an<br>
extremely robust error correction algorithm, as atmospheric distortion and<br>
stray light will be adding lots of noise. <br>
<p>
The theoretical maximum baud rate is 1/2 the carrier frequency, so you<br>
won't be seriously limited in speed with a laser signal. The actual data<br>
rate will probably be about 10% of the maximum to give a reasonable S/N<br>
number, and then the packeting and error correction overhead will be<br>
subtracted from that.<br>
<p>
I assume this would be a packet based system, otherwise you are just doing<br>
a single point to point link?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this worked, it would be an interesting option for</i><br>
<i>&gt;covert/subversive/etc. communications.  Lock onto your satellite of choice</i><br>
<i>&gt;and send the data.  Encryption would be necessary, but it would probably be</i><br>
<i>&gt;difficult to locate the sender, especially if the laser didn't operate at</i><br>
<i>&gt;visible wavelengths.  The problem I see is the possibility that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't get a good scatter off the satellite.  I know that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ground-laser-to-geosync works because my mother used to work in a building</i><br>
<i>&gt;where data was transmitted that way, but I am unsure how the downlink worked.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It would be impossible to locate the sender from the ground. Surveillance<br>
satellites could be easily made to pinpoint such laser signals from orbit,<br>
however. The probability of a short transmission being seen is very low,<br>
unless there's hundreds of such satellites up there..<br>
<p>
Neat idea..<br>
