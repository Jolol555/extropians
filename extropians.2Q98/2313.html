  IAN: The Sikhs became a warfare-associated religion<br>
  (carrying of knives is a religious costume) only after<br>
  attempts by others to exterminate them. The original guru<br>
  of the Sikh tradition, Guru Nanak (1469), was very much a <br>
  libertarian. The work ethic and a de facto privet property <br>
  basis of free trade was and is the Sikh social ethic.<br>
<p>
  Guru Nanak was against magic and ritual and persuaded<br>
  people to look for the truth, not miracles and rites.<br>
  It was not till Guru Gobind Singh, the ninth and final<br>
  head Guru after Nanak, that Sikhs adopted the warrior<br>
  model, but it's my understanding it was defensive.<br>
<p>
  While Buddhism tends to be a religion where the highest<br>
  ideal is retreat and contemplation, Sikhism's highest <br>
  ideal is of a religious householder involved in some <br>
  form of productive enterprise. Apart from the<br>
  horrible examples of terrorism in modern Indian<br>
  culture, Sikhism has strong libertarian ethics.<br>

  IAN: Consider that most of mathematics kept <br>
  flowing out of India, even as math continued<br>
  to progress, innovations like 0 and negative<br>
  numbers came from India (via Arabia). I<br>
  think that eastern thought is still hundreds<br>
  of years a ahead of the West, and we can see <br>
  that in religion. Western religions are vir-<br>
  tually all of a primitive tribal nature, but<br>
  yogic, Buddhist, and Taoist philosophies (be<br>
  they true or false) are phenomenally sublime<br>
  and evolved observations of the nature of <br>
  being, mind, and reality, intricate sciences <br>
  of bodily postures and breathing systems that<br>
  induce states of expanded awareness. These<br>
  philosophies and technologies are, like our<br>
  system of numbers, signs of high evolution.<br>
<p>
  What the West has had, more than teaching <br>
  people about science, is free market capi-<br>
  talism and limited government. Free markets<br>
  have advanced our society more then science, <br>
  for example, the USSR produced more scientists<br>
  than we did (I believe), but they went nowhere.<br>
  A scientist with no captial investment is null.<br>
  So the fact that we are more technologically<br>
  evolved than the East creates an illusion <br>
  that we are more intellectually evolved,<br>
  but in fact only measures that we had<br>
  high IQ in the political areas expressed<br>
  in willful limitations on central authority.<br>
<p>
  The east has been drawn in totalitarian govt.<br>
  If free-market capitalism could take over the <br>
  East, we'd see an explosion of technological,<br>
  capital, and intellectual evolution the world <br>
  over, the likes of which we have never seen.<br>
