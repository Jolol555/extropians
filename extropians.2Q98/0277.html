While I agree with the upper statements, your last is at the least foolish,<br>
and at the worst completely, criminally, ludicrous. To fail to respond with<br>
greater force to an individual who uses force to impose his will, gain his ro<br>
her ends simply winds up in a vicious cycle of them demanding more and more<br>
from you until you are enslaved or dead.  Responding with such force that you<br>
kill such primitive individual stops the vicious cycle in the first step, and<br>
hopefully before this individual has had a chance to reproduce, thus you are<br>
improving the genetic pool of humanity and advancing evolution.<br>
<p>
I would have  thought that people such as Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Stalin,<br>
Hussein, Quaddaffi would have established a good enough pool of examples of<br>
the foolishness of appeasement to end such stupid statements from polluting<br>
intelligent discussions.<br>
<p>
Up here in New Hampshire (yup, here I go again), as well as across the river<br>
in Vermont, we have possibly the highest per capita level of gun ownership in<br>
the industrialized world, and probably the one of the highest in the entire<br>
world, yet I challenge anyone on this list to name one European or other<br>
industrialized nation of the same size or larger as our state, that has a more<br>
restrictive gun policy yet has a lower crime rate. You can't. That should be<br>
enough to kill any further debate on such a silly statement as your last. (oh,<br>
and btw, if you try to claim that its because we're all rich or something, our<br>
state is below the national average in per capita income by a hefty<br>
percentage.)<br>
