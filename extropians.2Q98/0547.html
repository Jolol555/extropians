<i>&gt; From:          Eugene Leitl &lt;eugene@liposome.genebee.msu.su&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Tet came on April 15th this year.</i><br>
<p>
I'm worried about this analogy.<br>
<p>
Because if the situation actually follows the analogy, the <br>
government's current surrender on this point will be followed within <br>
a week by a *successful* prohibition of all good cryptography in any <br>
circumstances except under government orders.<br>
<p>
See, the Tet offensive was a massive failure in military terms.  The <br>
only reason it was a success in *any* terms was that if the US <br>
government's statements about its previous successes had been true, <br>
the NV/Vietcong would not have had the capability to pull it off.  <br>
But by the end of the week, what the US government had previously <br>
said about the state of the NV military was a serious overstatement; <br>
there would have been effectively nothing stopping us from marching <br>
north through North Vietnam until we ran into the Chinese.<br>
