I don't remember it even being mentioned as a part of the tobacco bill - but then,<br>
I don't really follow human press...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Senate Okays Massive Anti-Drug Package In Tobacco Bill</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	  June 11, 1998, Washington, D.C.:  The Senate narrowly approved an </i><br>
<i>&gt;amendment to the tobacco-control bill on Tuesday that seeks to spend $16 </i><br>
<i>&gt;billion targeting and enhancing penalties against marijuana users.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Amendment 2451, spearheaded by Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), funds state </i><br>
<i>&gt;efforts to "establish state registration programs" for convicted </i><br>
<i>&gt;marijuana sellers, drug test teenage driver's license applicants, drug </i><br>
<i>&gt;test junior high and high school students, allow law enforcement to check </i><br>
<i>&gt;motorists for the presence of marijuana metabolites, and encourage small </i><br>
<i>&gt;businesses to adopt drug-free workplace programs.  The measure also </i><br>
<i>&gt;amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 by prohibiting anyone convicted </i><br>
<i>&gt;of a felony drug offense from receiving any student loan, grant, or work </i><br>
<i>&gt;assistance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	  "These Republican-backed anti-drug measures treat otherwise law </i><br>
<i>&gt;abiding marijuana smokers as if they were enemies of the state," said </i><br>
<i>&gt;NORML Executive Director R. Keith Stroup, Esq.  "Tens of thousands of </i><br>
<i>&gt;hard-working, productive citizens -- including many of the best and </i><br>
<i>&gt;brightest college students -- would be unfairly penalized by these </i><br>
<i>&gt;draconian proposals."</i><br>
<i>&gt;	  Stroup called the provision to register convicted marijuana sellers </i><br>
<i>&gt;especially disturbing.  The amendment states that anyone "who is </i><br>
<i>&gt;convicted of a criminal offense involving drug trafficking [must] </i><br>
<i>&gt;register a current address with a designated state law enforcement agency </i><br>
<i>&gt;for up to ten years following" the date of conviction or release from </i><br>
<i>&gt;prison.  The provision further says that the information collected under </i><br>
<i>&gt;the registration program "may be disclosed for any purpose permitted </i><br>
<i>&gt;under the laws of the state."  Presently, several states have enacted </i><br>
<i>&gt;similar registration laws for those individuals found guilty of </i><br>
<i>&gt;committing sex offenses against children.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	  Attorney Tanya Kangas, Director of Litigation for The NORML </i><br>
<i>&gt;Foundation, said that many of the drug testing initiatives proposed by </i><br>
<i>&gt;the amendment appear unworkable and may be unconstitutional.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;"Implementing federal legislation to give law enforcement the authority </i><br>
<i>&gt;to screen for drug metabolites will violate privacy and search </i><br>
<i>&gt;protections," she said.  "Blood tests are excessively invasive; urine </i><br>
<i>&gt;tests do not indicate impairment and cannot be collected consistent with </i><br>
<i>&gt;constitutional standards for traffic stop searches.  We can restrict </i><br>
<i>&gt;people from driving while impaired without violating the Constitutional </i><br>
<i>&gt;as this amendment proposes."  </i><br>
<i>&gt;	  The proposal mandates law enforcement to suspend the license of any </i><br>
<i>&gt;driver who tests positive for drug metabolites.  Marijuana metabolites </i><br>
<i>&gt;may be present in urine for periods of 30 to 40 days after last use of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the drug.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	  Kangas also questioned the fairness of federally-encouraged </i><br>
<i>&gt;suspicionless drug testing in schools and the workplace.  Presently, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Supreme Court maintains that drug testing by the state without </i><br>
<i>&gt;individualized suspicion is legal only if there exists "special needs, </i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond the normal need for law enforcement." </i><br>
<i>&gt;	  The provision denying federal student loan assistance to convicted </i><br>
<i>&gt;marijuana felons is similar to a House amendment approved earlier this </i><br>
<i>&gt;year.  NORML National Campus Coordinator Aaron Wilson said that both </i><br>
<i>&gt;pieces of legislation unfairly punish marijuana users.  "It is outrageous </i><br>
<i>&gt;that Congress would pass this law denying financial aid to students for </i><br>
<i>&gt;non-violent drug offenses, while a felony conviction for a serious </i><br>
<i>&gt;violent crime brings no such penalty," he said.  "What kind of message is </i><br>
<i>&gt;Congress sending?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;	  Senators voted 52-46 for the anti-drug amendment, with all but two </i><br>
<i>&gt;Republicans supporting it and all Democrats opposed.  The tobacco measure </i><br>
<i>&gt;still needs approval from the Senate and the House.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	  "Attaching this amendment to the tobacco-control bill is nothing more </i><br>
<i>&gt;than a sneak attack by Republicans to escalate the war on marijuana </i><br>
<i>&gt;smokers," Stroup said.</i><br>
