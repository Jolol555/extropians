Unfortunately, I must seriously disagree with you, as treating truth<br>
subjectively is the first step toward the destruction of the concept of<br>
contract law. In any libertarian type society, where there is no<br>
overarching sovereign authority to enforce the public will and contracts<br>
amongst individuals, on individuals, individuals must rely on and protect<br>
in their daily lives the concepts of integrity, honesty, and truth to<br>
ensure that the contracts they make between sovereign individuals are<br>
honored. THis is the essential key to keep a libertarian society from<br>
devolving into chaotic anarchy/civil terror. I think that demanding that<br>
truth for a given be at least agreed to by two soveregn individuals,<br>
otherwize a contract has no meaning, if it means two different things to<br>
two different people. Being strictly utilitarian with regard to truth means<br>
one is merely an opportunist, with no regard for others and with no greater<br>
purpose other than for one's immediate short term profit.<br>
<p>
Libertarians know that a stable libertarian society requires that most, if<br>
not all members must have a distinct sense that integrity and honesty<br>
amongst members of the community is most beneficial to every individuals<br>
long term self interest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   But this picture paints a false "same as"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   relation between utility and truth. While</i><br>
<i>&gt;   utility can always be defined as subjec-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tive (even a useful thing like a spoon</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is not useful if you prefer to eat with</i><br>
<i>&gt;   your hands), but truth is no so subjec-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tive. If all can see that it's raining</i><br>
<i>&gt;   outside, but one guy says it's a sunny</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and dry day, we may say, "Well that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the truth for him," but I'm comfortable</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is saying that it is not THE truth, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;   thus I feel we can say truth is objective.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   I believe that we can have a scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;   definition of truth (a one-one or maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;   onto function, or both) that eliminates</i><br>
<i>&gt;   in one fell swoop this morass of subjec-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tive truth,  which I think is a direct</i><br>
<i>&gt;   threat to science and ethical standards</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as this leads to a "utility first" frame-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   work that leads to "anything goes."</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is the whole reason behind what is termed by many conservatives<br>
as the 'degradation' of society. If everything is subjective, as liberals<br>
are wont to establish as a societal truth, then anything goes. THe<br>
resulting destabilization causes people to prefer more authoritarian<br>
statist measures to return society to 'normalcy'. This is not an accident.<br>
Creating dissafected classes is essential to generating support for<br>
authoritarian statist measures in any society, which is a central strategy<br>
of terrorists and subversive groups in order to generate general sentiment<br>
for their goals, as increasing authoritarian repression of dissafected<br>
classes is essential to creating the atmosphere for a general uprising.<br>
This is standard strategy taught in ChiCom, bolshevik, and other nihilist<br>
guerrilla schools.<br>
