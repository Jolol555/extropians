<p>
It does sound agreeable, especially to someone like myself, who is under<br>
the spell of transhumanism and Extropianism.  Nonetheless, I am wary<br>
because I wonder how much is platitude and how much is substance.<br>
(I apply the same to Extropian and transhumanist manifestoes.  Maybe<br>
manifestoes have to be this way.  I hope not!  But maybe...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I have been involved for over 5 years with organized humanism, inspired</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the promethean stance suggested by the quote above.  The Humanist</i><br>
<i>&gt;Community meets at Stanford University.  See &lt;<a href="http://humanists.org">http://humanists.org</a>&gt;.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt;own impression is that Humanists are more accepting of conventionally</i><br>
<i>&gt;assumed limits of human nature, and less interested in extrapolating from</i><br>
<i>&gt;current technology than the Extropian/Transhumanist movement. Sometimes I</i><br>
<i>&gt;get bored.  They definitely are more inclined toward collective solutions</i><br>
<i>&gt;to problems than the libertarians in the Extropian movement.</i><br>
<p>
To some extent, this might be expected.  I don't wish to be too charitable<br>
either.  I _bet_ most secular humanists are desirous of passing themselves<br>
off as reasonable and conventional, while with transhumanists, Extropians<br>
and libertarians -- never those who are all three!:) -- there seems to be a<br>
tendency to be more radical than thou.  (I find this trait to be mostly pleasing<br>
even if it is sometimes shallow and tedious.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I agree with someone who said that Humanists, although agnostic/atheist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;have more of the Judeo-Christian values than Transhumanists, and Humanists</i><br>
<i>&gt;tend to address issues from more of a religious/ethical viewpoint.  Perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is why they are so reviled by fundamentalist Christians --- you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;write off someone who is radically different, but it's frustrating to deal</i><br>
<i>&gt;with someone who is culturally similar enough to you to be relevant, yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;differs sharply on important issue(s).</i><br>
<p>
With humans, this is usually the case.  The nations which are in close<br>
geographic proximity are typically the worst of enemies -- typically but not<br>
necessarily.  In ideology and philosophy, the more radical the ideas, it<br>
seems, the less tolerant of difference and dissent seem the purveyors of<br>
such.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Any anthropologist who was dropped into both communities would observe</i><br>
<i>&gt;that Humanists are generally older than Extropians/Transhumanists.</i><br>
<p>
This has been my experience also.  I've never met a secular humanist under<br>
thirty.  However, my experience is very limited in this area.  Need I metion I<br>
do not seek their company these days?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  My view is that Humanists and Transhumanists have enough common values to</i><br>
<i>&gt;work together in science-promotion, euthenasia legalization, and other</i><br>
<i>&gt;areas.  But to do that we have to avoid overemphasizing where we differ.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you want to travel widely, build bridges, not walls.</i><br>
<p>
That depends on whether the differences are fundamental and how we<br>
define fundamental.  To illustrate, both libertarians and socialists, in their<br>
more pure forms, would agree that the present society is unjust.  They<br>
might even agree on many other issues, such as abolishing corporate<br>
welfare.  Even so, would libertarians (on this list and elsewhere) really<br>
think it good to form a coalition and even offer support to socialists?  I<br>
doubt it!<br>
<p>
I think a very divisive, and rightly so!, issue would be that of mortality.<br>
 Secular humanists seem to embrace it while transhumanists/Etropians<br>
see such an embrace as anathema -- even if we admit to having no<br>
means of immortality as yet.  Still, perhaps secular humanists take this<br>
position merely for tactical reasons.  Also, it might be the case that<br>
only the leaders of the movement take this position, while the rank and<br>
file don't care.  And it could be that secular humanists on the whole<br>
have no thought the matter over and would likely be swayed our way<br>
if we make the effort.<br>
<p>
In final analysis, we need to ask not only if it is possible to persuade<br>
them but if it is worth it.<br>
