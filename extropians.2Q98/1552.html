Things have been a bit rough recently for I-kicked-the-damned-stone-OK?<br>
Realists.  I was enchanted and mildly gob-smacked today to read in the 2<br>
May 1998 *New Scientist* of a new wrinkle on quantum computing.  Alas, I<br>
don't have the names to cite, because I read it in the library, and NS's<br>
web site gives no details, just this screamer:  <br>
<p>
CRAZY LOGIC<br>
                   There's a weird world where computers give<br>
                   you an answer just by being there. You don't<br>
                   even have to switch them on <br>
<p>
The bottom line is that some clever fellow has worked out how to get<br>
answers out of a quantum preparation *without turning the machine on to run<br>
the calculation*.<br>
<p>
It's based on the bomb-testing idea I'm sure you're all familiar with from<br>
Penrose's SHADOWS OF THE MIND.  Elitzur and Vaidman showed that one time in<br>
4 you can determine the state of a macro-system, *without observing it*, if<br>
it is coupled to a quantum detector.  All that's needed is for the<br>
observation to be *possible* via that procedure, and quantum interference<br>
can deliver you information about the real world without actually looking<br>
at it.  Some of the time, anyway.  And since that's true, a sequence of<br>
assays can multiply up your level of confidence to whatever degree you wish.<br>
<p>
This has now been extended, in principle, to such tasks as intractable<br>
computations.  I'm not talking boring old-fashioned quantum computers here,<br>
with their staid superposition of all possible calculations.  Those dreary<br>
things had to be turned on and powered up.  This gadget doesn't need to be<br>
activated until *after* it's done the job.  (What's more, it's reported<br>
that objects have now been `photographed' using this principle without<br>
shining any light on them, simply because light *could have been* shone on<br>
them....)<br>
<p>
Penrose is evidently rubbing his hands with glee, because this sounds like<br>
it might be the missing link in his theory that neural microtubules can<br>
sustain quantal superpositions in something like a Bose condensate.  The<br>
brain might thus leap instantly and without frying itself to conclusions<br>
that even the smartest Turing Jupiter brain would be agonising over to the<br>
end of time...<br>
<p>
I dunno.  Sounds like witchcraft to me.  Pretty logic, though.<br>
