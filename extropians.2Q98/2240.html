-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>
<p>
Hal Finney's and Harvey Newstrom's responses made it clear to me that my<br>
question wasn't phrased specifically enough. Here are some underlying<br>
assumptions I forgot to mention: <br>
<p>
1. Remailers are not the weakest security link. <br>
	Today, there are remailers that randomize the order in which<br>
messages are sent, and encrypt the sender/recipient databases. Most<br>
serious users have their message go through a chain of several remailers<br>
before it gets to the destination. <br>
<p>
2. The physical security of your computer is not the weakest link.<br>
	Physical security is really a separate discussion. <br>
<p>
3. The software security of your computer is not the weakest link.<br>
	If your PC is running an OS not designed for remote control<br>
(MacOS, DOS, stand-alone Win95) and no network software except an<br>
encrypted telnet, ssh, or email client you pretty much don't have to worry<br>
about remote inflitration or sniffing. Denial of service attacks probably<br>
can't be prevented, though.<br>
<p>
4. Encryption technology advances along with cracking technology, always<br>
remaining a step or two ahead. <br>
	There are multiple ways to encrypt any given piece of data, but<br>
only one correct way to interpret a given piece of encrypted data.<br>
<p>
	Sasha pointed out that "the person's interests may be hurt by<br>
actions directed at this pseudonym - it becomes part of one's identity".<br>
True, you can be slandered. However, you cannot be killed, arrested,<br>
deported, fired, or stripped of net access-- unless the pseudonymous<br>
entity you're talking to tells your adversaries about your future plans,<br>
thus allowing them to be waiting for you when you get there, whoever you<br>
are. <br>
	The weak link is the human factor. How do you know that the person<br>
you're talking to can be trusted, or, how do you talk to someone you<br>
aren't sure you trust? The three (non-rigorous) ways I've thought of so<br>
far are: <br>
<p>
1. Have a well known third party sign both keys. This is probably a bad<br>
idea if this person can be "gotten to" because it implies they know both<br>
of the secret agents. Hmm... perhaps a well known _anonymous_ persona... <br>
see the next item, though. <br>
<p>
2. Spend a long time establishing the credentials of your anonymous<br>
persona. Theoretically a sufficiently dedicated adversary can spend a long<br>
time doing this, though, and fool you. <br>
<p>
3. Come up with a test that would rule out certain types of infiltrators. <br>
For example, if it's the US gov you're worried about, ask them mail you a<br>
copy of PGP accross the US border thus breaking Federal law. If it's the<br>
religious fundies you're worried about, ask them to write something really<br>
blasphemous. I know, I know, this is really weak. They will find<br>
loopholes, and they'll probably not be above breaking their own rules on<br>
occasion.<br>
<p>
What do you think?<br>
<p>
PS: Ooh, I think I came up with a scheme for doing this, but it might be<br>
long, so I'll put this into a separate message after I've thought about it<br>
for a while.<br>
<p>
                                            --Sincerely, Alex F. Bokov<br>
