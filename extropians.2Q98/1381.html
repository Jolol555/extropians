It's certainly intriguing that our best models of the universe seem to<br>
allow for something as paradoxical as time travel.  The question is,<br>
is there something wrong with the models, or something wrong with the<br>
universe? :-)<br>
<p>
Oops, my prejudice is showing.  I can hardly believe that time travel<br>
will be possible because of the paradoxes and contradictions it would<br>
bring.<br>
<p>
David Deutsch has suggested that the paradoxes could be resolved if you<br>
combine time travel with parallel universes, so that when you go back into<br>
the past you are moving into a parallel universe.  That way you never close<br>
the circle and can't change your past, avoiding contradictions.  But I<br>
haven't seen a rigorous explanation of this idea.<br>
