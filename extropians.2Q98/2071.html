The magazine of a national daily newspaper this weekend ("The Australian<br>
Magazine May 30-31 1998") devoted an issue to 'future technologies'.<br>
All newbie stuff and no new news, but Extropians got a mention.<br>
<p>
Carole Parker (author of 'The Joy of Cybersex') in an article beginning page<br>
43 titled "Getting it on - line" slides us in between tele-dildonics (don't<br>
ask) and VR.<br>
She writes;<br>
"Perhaps, as the extropian movement hopes, your computer will one day be<br>
implanted in your brain and it will transmit your thoughts to another 'post<br>
human' in computer-mediated telepathy.  Your body may just become the lump<br>
of flesh you would like to leave behind as you send your inner self off into<br>
the ether.  And which will be more real ?  Your flesh or virtual self ?  At<br>
that point it may be taken that your body is merely occupying space on earth<br>
while your mind is involved in a society that has no physical presence as we<br>
know it now."<br>
<p>
Australian subscribers should tune into the first new Geoffrey Robertson<br>
'Hypothetical' at 9.40pm on ch7 (June1 Bris,Syd - June 4 Melb, Adel, Perth)<br>
His subject is 'Send in the Clones'.<br>
