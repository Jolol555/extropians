<i>&gt;No, it's NOT a type of coercion, for two obvious reasons:  first, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;entirely under the control of the believer to believe or not to believe,</i><br>
<p>
Wrong. The believer does only have the illusion of control of what he<br>
thinks, just as any human. Consciousness is not really control, just the<br>
illusion of it. Information processing is what counts, and it is entirely<br>
handled by the brain, without any control. If I feed you with the right<br>
information, I can make you anything I want. This would require a LOT of<br>
experience and a very big brain, though. A posthuman could do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and second, it is entirely within the believer's power to stop listening to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the atheist.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's usually within his freedom of actions, unless he is tied to a tree. But<br>
he may not want to, because he believes that nothing can shake his<br>
worldview. For example, Christians usually don't think much about Jesus'<br>
historical existence, they just believe in "what is written" and what they<br>
are told. And when you tell them about the historical Jesus, they might be<br>
fascinated at first. But when a fanatic Christian realizes the full<br>
implications of the Dead Sea Scrolls, everything is possible. From Amok to<br>
Suicide.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1)  Axiom.  I cannot force someone to do something which is entirely under</i><br>
<i>&gt;their control.</i><br>
<p>
There is no control.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2) Observed.  It is entirely under the control of the believer to believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;or not to believe.</i><br>
<p>
There is no control.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3)  Therefore.  I cannot force someone to not believe.</i><br>
<p>
Wrong assumptions, wrong conclusions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4)  Observed.  It is entirely under the control of the believer to listen</i><br>
<i>&gt;to me or not listen to me.</i><br>
<p>
There is no control.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;5)  Therefore.  I cannot force someone to listen to me.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Wrong assumptions, wrong conclusions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am an extropian.  Max More is not my leader.  I am under no obligation to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do anything at all for Mr. More.  If he told me to do something I didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to do, I would not do it.  I wouldn't even consider doing it.  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;take orders from him, do not believe everything he says (and in fact,</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagree with his views semi-regularly) and don't think he is in any</i><br>
<i>&gt;supernatural way better than anybody else I've ever met.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe the word 'leader' is too strong. I meant to imply that people have<br>
centered around Max and his ideas, many of these people absorbing these<br>
ideas without deeper consideration (they cannot consider them, because<br>
criticism of the basic ideas is forbidden on this list, and with whom should<br>
they discuss them if not with the Extropians themselves?). I did NOT mean to<br>
imply that you are all following Max and his 'orders' sheepishly and I<br>
apologize if it has been understood this way. The right expression is<br>
probably 'guide', not 'leader'. Would you agree that Max More has been a<br>
guide for you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Cults claim to be true by assumption.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;presume that their tenets are axiomatic and undoubtedly true.  Their</i><br>
<i>&gt;fundamentals are simply right, and there is no argument to be made.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropy is not a cult.</i><br>
<p>
If I look at the discussion policy here, I get an opposite view. Your<br>
fundamentals are considered as being simply right and you do not want to<br>
discuss them. By saying "go to a different list", you do not, as you have<br>
tried to convince me, just redirect traffic somewhere else. No other list<br>
but the Extropian mailing list is read by so many Extropians -- this is<br>
obvious. On the other hand, discussion of Extropian views would be totally<br>
inappropriate on the transhuman mailing list, as many of the people there<br>
are not Extropians and have rejected the Extropian ideas long ago. The<br>
Extropian mailing list is the only list where the fundamentals of Extropy<br>
can be discussed. Disallowing it is cultish.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(13 deserves a bit of defense, but only a bit:  The "Extropian Principles"</i><br>
<i>&gt;document is in version 2.6 last I checked; any part of the document can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;changed.</i><br>
<p>
You could add such a note to the Bible, too, without having to be afraid<br>
that it would have any effect, because the majority would reject any<br>
changes. And I bet that the basic Extropian Principles will remain mostly<br>
unmodified for the next decades.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is misleading.  It's fine for extropianism to be criticized; that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;what keeps us all rational.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, we also like to have positive</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussions about extropy, in which we aren't defending extropianism from</i><br>
<i>&gt;criticism but rather discuss ways to bring extropy about.</i><br>
<p>
Understandable. That's the missionary role of your cult :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As you can see, both discussions are perfectly normal and proper; we only</i><br>
make the extra<br>
<i>&gt;leap to say that we would prefer to have these different discussions on</i><br>
<i>&gt;separate lists.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
See above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The fundamentals of extropianism are not inviolate columns of stone; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact that you seem to think so (IMO) belies your misunderstanding of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophy.  And if we cannot take criticism, how and why would I reply</i><br>
<i>&gt;with syllogisms rather than insults?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Because my mail contained mainly opinion and little facts. It was not<br>
criticism but critcism of not being allowed to criticize. It was written<br>
without any source, without any document refered to. I agree that such<br>
provocative postings should be kept to a minimum. I am opposing your<br>
non-criticism policy, and I used harsh words to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Of course I haven't even started to seriously criticize Extropy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;quivers with fear&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Don't. As it looks now, Max would rather remove me than allow anything like<br>
this. I am not on the transhuman list and I will not resubscribe because I<br>
cannot keep up with the traffic (it was very high when I was subscribed the<br>
last time), so that probably means that you can have your little party<br>
without me.<br>
