<i>&gt; What is the flaw in changing the name Anarcho-Capitalism to Agoric</i><br>
<i>&gt; Democracy?</i><br>
<p>
      It would be a _lie_.  Good definitions read 'from right to left.'<br>
<p>
                  <br>
The flaw is that Capitalism is neither anarchic nor agoric, and -- as Noam <br>
Chomsky among many others has pointed out -- Anarcho-Capitalism would in <br>
practice very likely produce the most hideous tyranny the world has ever <br>
seen.  You do not have to meet many Anarcho-Capitalists to realize this. <br>
These are people whose minds have been seized by an axiomatized deductive <br>
system.  Every question becomes ansered by a look-up table, or mantra-like <br>
incantations of 'the market will sort it out.'<br>
<p>
   Even 'saints' would wind up as tyrants under anarcho-capitalism.<br>
<p>
      Individual freedom is an optimum, not an absolute.<br>
<p>
   [ FX: "SHOUT MODE ON:" ]<br>
<p>
      There is no 'Absolute Foundation' for property rights, and to <br>
      propose to base an entire society on the illusion that there is, is <br>
      the sort of crass folly only clever people are capable of.<br>
<p>
   [ FX: "SHOUT MODE OFF" ] <br>
<p>
      Even _one_ working example would be nice...<br>
<p>
<p>
Capitalism. (n).  Hierarchical economic system structured to give further <br>
cascading privileges to the existing owners and controllers of Capital.  <br>
Usually turns into 'crony-Capitalism' (ref: Hernando de Soto, 'El Otro Sendero').  <br>
<p>
Supposed benefits include fabled 'trickle-down' of economic resources, <br>
which is no doubt why 350 000 children die _every day_ from preventable <br>
disease and malnutrition.  Imagine yourself reading gung-ho capitalist <br>
tracts to them as they die hideously in front of your eyes...<br>
<p>
<p>
Agorism. (n). Horizontalist, 'reticular' or networked system of <br>
interacting _equals_.  Note that Agorism is a fully-fledged _social_ <br>
system while Capitalism is an _economic_ system.<br>
<p>
<p>
Anarcho-Capitalism: (n). Imaginary system of society where powers of <br>
absolute government (secret police;  mass murder -- i.e. nuclear weaopons; <br>
torture chambers -- i.e. maximum security prisons; judicial murder -- i.e. <br>
'the death penalty', etc. etc.) are all up for sale to the highest <br>
bidders. Any half-way intelligent devious 'Capitalist' (I know several) <br>
will show you how to turn all this into an absolute dictatorship while <br>
still retaining the 'anarcho-capitalist' labels and trimmings.  Take a <br>
look at some of the caricatures of the 'New World Order' sometime.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ask an 'anarcho-capitalist' if they believe in (a) unrestricted private <br>
ownership of thermonuclear weapons (i.e. the means of indiscriminate mass <br>
murder) and (b) systematized murder (the 'death penalty'), all under their <br>
personal control.  If they answer 'yes', (a) pre-emptively kill them if <br>
they give you a funny look; or (b) run like hell!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
  Whereas Democratic Agorism already exists -- i.e. <br>
<p>
      <a href="http://www.agora.demon.co.uk/agora3.txt">http://www.agora.demon.co.uk/agora3.txt</a><br>
<p>
<p>
In practice, 'anarcho-capitalism' is 'salonfahig'; a fashionable fig-leaf <br>
for existing privilege, and a time-sink and a pitfall for freedom-seekers. <br>
Anarcho-capitalists usually attach themselves to right-wing conservatives <br>
for company -- i.e. to right-wing pols like Thatcher, or 'intellectuals' <br>
like Charles Murray).  Amusingly, many 'anarcho-capitalists' are State <br>
agents of various kinds; nothing against State agents, you understand... <br>
Some of my best friends...  &gt;:-}<br>
