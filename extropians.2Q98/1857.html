<i>&gt; translunar</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
They all seem to be advertising that they will achieve the much-vaunted<br>
$1,000/pound mark.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; 2005 - 2015</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I think the development of space during this period, assuming we still</i><br>
don't <br>

<i>&gt;  costs down below $100/kg, the long-term payoff vs the initial costs of </i><br>
<i>&gt; development</i><br>

<p>
Yes, although I think we'll see a significant upward increase in developmental<br>
trends and much synergy between specific projects at the $1,000/pound level<br>
(what is that, $2,200/kg?).  In particular, I think it very possible that the<br>
LEO satellite fleets will create a market for fairly sophisticated telerobotic<br>
servicing devices within ten years of Teledesic's deployment, i.e. at around<br>
2010-2015.<br>
<p>
I think we will see very significant developments before the $100/kg and full-<br>
blown assembler point, simply because micro-machine technology really does<br>
provide real payoffs at the $1,000/pound level.  The generation of sensors and<br>
effectuators going into the pipeline now yield real improvements at this<br>
level: Check out the size and capability of the very tiny video cameras aboard<br>
the "New Millenium" series of probes and compare their functionality at 10% of<br>
the weight of the previous generation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  For many applications </i><br>
<i>&gt; Teledesic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will probably be replaced by much larger and more stable geostationary </i><br>
<i>&gt; satellites</i><br>
<i>&gt;  offering enhanced and comprehensive global telecommunication services.  </i><br>
<p>
I think not: The relatively long light-speed latency inherent in GEO<br>
installations puts them out of the running for most high-speed, real-time<br>
applications.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Near-</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;  asteroid capture will become big business as the cost of capturing such </i><br>
<i>&gt; objects</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will pale in comparison to the costs of transporting the same materials off</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Earth.  This in turn will facilitate major improvements in space-based</i><br>
<i>&gt;  manufacturing, CELSS, space medicine, human-habitation-ergonomics.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but I think not until after the period we've been discussing.  The first-<br>
stage telerobotic infrastructure I envision developing in the 2010-2015 period<br>
won't be capable of handling the entire chain of resource extraction and<br>
manufacturing from asteroid to finished product.  <br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Obviously, once nanoengineered materials arrive on the scene, such space</i><br>
<i>&gt;  development will accelerate dramatically.</i><br>
<p>
IMHO, it will take full-blown Drextech to make asteroid mining profitable and<br>
this industry will develop within 25 to 50 years after that point.<br>
