<i>&gt; I thought the Microsoft problem came from their strongarm tactics of</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling PC vendors they could not offer competing software on PCs with</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft OS installed, thus preventing other software makers from</i><br>
<i>&gt; contracting with these same vendors to include THEIR code..</i><br>
<p>
The problem is that the complaintants are only the BIG PC makers. The small guys<br>
don't care or have not had problems. Where Microsoft demanded this special<br>
treatement with PC makers was because the big PC makers wanted specially low<br>
pricing on Windows, lower than what they were previously paying on their normal<br>
quantity scales. In exchange, Microsoft decided that they wanted tit for tat,<br>
special treatment for special treatment. I am surprised that nobody has mentioned<br>
this in the news at all....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Something akin to the way car Chevy dealers used to be prohibited from</i><br>
<i>&gt; selling other brands in the same showroom with Chevys - I believe something</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal was done about that a few years ago.. Coke and Pepsi at the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; fountain - etc. etc. etc. All these are 'monopolies' of a sort, aren't they?</i><br>
<p>
No, they are merely competetive advantages. It seems that the Justice Dept has<br>
strayed from mere anti-trust into the area of nullifying competetive advantage.<br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I don't like many of the things that microsoft does, but they<br>
are mostly to do with the way their software works. If their 'monopoly' is such a<br>
problem with consumers, then the market should be able to protest with their<br>
dollars just like any other democracy.<br>
