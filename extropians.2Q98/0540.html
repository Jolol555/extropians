I certainly agree with you there.<br>

That quantum electronics is more primitive than attempts to do mechanics <br>
at the quantum level may be so, although I haven't seen any especially <br>
good indicators of this. I look in on the quantum electronics field every <br>
few months, and things seem to be coming along quite quickly at the <br>
moment. I hope we can agree that it is worth pursuing as one possible <br>
path to nanotech!<br>

<p>
Quantum electronics is not necessary for quantum computing. Indeed, the <br>
article posted by John Clark referred to NMR computing, which is based on <br>
the nuclear spin magnetic moment. I believe that the nuclear coupling is <br>
actually mediated by electrons, however for all practicial purposes <br>
this is not an electronic device. Neither is the linear ion trap, <br>
which is perhaps the strongest candidate we now have for medium scale <br>
quantum computing.<br>
