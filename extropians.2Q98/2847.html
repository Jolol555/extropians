When I saw the the thread about the infinite regress of<br>
turtles/particles/explanations, I smiled a very big smile, for it reminded<br>
me of a delightful experience.<br>
<p>
Hara Ra and I have been friends for over 25 years, and I was visiting him<br>
some months ago.  He had read Ken Wilbur's "Sex, Mind and Ecology" which<br>
discussed the concept that nature seems to be organized heirarchically<br>
(atoms, molecules, cells, etc.) and defines the essential "unit" of this<br>
hierarchy as a 'holon'. Hara Ra commisioned Thom Atkins to make a sculpture<br>
based on this idea and the<br>
notion of Fractal Turtles ("fracturtle").  <br>
<p>
So Thom, the artist, made Hara Ra a marvelous bronze cast sculpture.  It<br>
shows Hara Ra as himself wearing a large turtle shell, spinning the world<br>
on one finger while standing on the back of a large turtle, whose four feet<br>
rested on four smaller turtles, whose 16 feet rested on the backs of 16<br>
smaller turtles, which then stand on 64 yet smaller turtles!<br>
<p>
Hara Ra named the sculpture "Fractal Turtles", (Thom calls it "Tortelinni")<br>
since like a fractal, it is self similar, i.e., one can take a small portion<br>
and enlarge it to get the same image as the original.  And he pointed out that<br>
since the turtles are half sized at each level, the bottom level of "turtle<br>
dust" is found at the plane two Big Turtles below Hara Ra on the sculpture.<br>
So, an infinite number of levels of turtles, ever smaller, would converge<br>
at a finite distance below the Original Turtle.<br>
<p>
Hara Ra mentioned that Thom Atkins is willing to make more of these if<br>
anyone is interested.<br>
<p>
For me, seeing his "Fractal Turtles" was an experience of great delight,<br>
combining beauty with the fascination of a story and a concept marvelously<br>
expressed artistically.<br>
