AhhhhHHHHHHh!  Please *READ* my post as you obviously *didn't* the first<br>
time!<br>
<p>
You missed my entire my point which showed exactly that.  I'll repeat it<br>
again:<br>
<p>
**There is NO meaningful difference between Hyper-AI's and Transhumans.**<br>
<p>
Now that I've made that clear, my conclusions regarding the argument of<br>
'who grants rights to who' becomes moot.<br>

<p>
P.S.  Why are so many people on this list so preoccupied with shredding<br>
peoples arguments that they don't even bother reading or trying to<br>
understand what other people are writing?  If there is a loss of S/N on<br>
this list, it's due in large part to people putting their ego's and elitist<br>
bully attitudes first over genuine and healthy discussion and debate.  Am I<br>
alone on this list in thinking this way?<br>
