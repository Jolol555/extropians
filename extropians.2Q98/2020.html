<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  IAN: If location is not an attribute of identity,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  then identity is non-local, if identity is non-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  local, then A = -A, which is to say that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  identity of A exists equally in all locations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If location is not an attribute of identity, then objects in</i><br>
<i>&gt;different locations can be identical.  Identical objects in </i><br>
<i>&gt;different locations have different values of 'not-the-object',</i><br>
<i>&gt;so can not be defined by it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: If we want to exclude location from <br>
   the definition of A so we can say that A<br>
   does not change when its location changes, <br>
   we can. However, if we want to define the <br>
   nature of location, we will discover that <br>
   location is a product of holistic relation.<br>
<p>
   A is derived by holistic relation (A + -A) <br>
   just as the location (here) of A is derived <br>
   by holistic relation (here + -here). So the <br>
   argument that the location of A is not an <br>
   attribute of its identity did not free loca-<br>
   tion from the structure of holistic identity,<br>
   and as such no free identity has been shown.<br>
<p>
<p>
   Whenever we ask, "What is X?, where X is any-<br>
   thing you could imagine, we are asking a ques-<br>
   tion about identity, for which the exact answer<br>
   will always be: X is a product of the relation<br>
   of X and -X; and X does not exist outside that.<br>
<p>
   Where X is the whole, the whole is defined by <br>
   the relation of parts (-X) to the whole, X.<br>
   If there are no parts, there is no whole.<br>
<p>
   Find the thing not defined and surrounded by <br>
   a state or states of difference, and then <br>
   you will find evidence against holism.<br>
   Remember, the whole is not a thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Additionally, defining 'not-the-object' begs the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt;what set one is defining the 'not' operation on.  If we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;talking about the set { A B C }, then not-A is { B C }.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;we are considering the latin alphabet, not-A is { B .. Z }.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yet A retains its identity with each definition: it is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same symbol.  Indeed, the set { A B C } is a subset of the latin</i><br>
<i>&gt;alphabet.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: The symbol A is defined by the external <br>
   area surrounding it. If you put it in a set<br>
   with 3 members or a set with 26 members, the<br>
   same inverse shape defines the shape of A.<br>
   So, observing that A is always defined by <br>
   -A is not evidence against holism, but for!<br>
<p>
   Shifting around members of -A and observing <br>
   that the shape of A is the same, is not an<br>
   example that A is not defined by -A, if <br>
   that applies to what you're arguing.<br>
<p>
   If we have change and not-change, the change<br>
   is defined by its difference from not-change.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Thus A is defined, not solely by not-A, but by not-A and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;set or universe under consideration.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I'm confused by your conclusion since <br>
   it seems at odds with the case you were mak-<br>
   ing before it, which seemed to be that A does <br>
   not change when the members of -A changed. <br>
