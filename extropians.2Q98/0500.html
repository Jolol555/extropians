<i>&gt; I had heard that from my elementary teacher in the 80s, about the two week</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We watched a film about it, they showed the dog playing, but I dont</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember that much, it was 2 weeks though supposedly, maybe it</i><br>
<i>&gt; wasnt.</i><br>
<p>
That may have been Miles, a dog recovered from about 20 minutes at <br>
just *above* freezing temperature.  He generated a lot of <br>
publicity in the Eighties, even though many other labs had done as <br>
much or more.  Much of that publicity may be due to the misconception <br>
that he was frozen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People have been dead for longer than 15 min, I think like 30 min or an hour</i><br>
<i>&gt; while frozen, like from drowning in ice water, before being revived.</i><br>
<p>
Happens all the time.<br>
