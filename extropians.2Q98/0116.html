<p>
no, your first conclusion was right, they won't be in business for long.<br>
Which just means that they'll go PPAless, which just means they are easy<br>
pickings.  They are worth very little by definition, since we are assuming<br>
an open free market and their incomes are almost nonexistant.<br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not really, it just means that his growth wouldn't grow, but it does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mean that his growth would decline.  He could just keep a stable state and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;spend all his profits on his whims.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It would decline relative to those around him, who would continue to grow</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a far faster rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
so???  it's still not declining with respect to the targeted people and<br>
that's the only relation that counts.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;So, again we are trusting the powerful to be wise, just like in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;dictatorship, monarchy, democracy, or any other form of centralised</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not trusting anybody.  I continue to assert that Bill Gates would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; crushed if he tried to pursue the policy of enslavement.  The fact that he</i><br>
<i>&gt; knows this is only an additional safeguard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the indians will not be hiring anyone cos they will be dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, I'd missed this.  I'd thought he was trying to enslave the Indians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but you had meant he was trying kill them.  My mistake...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
no, enslavement was not the purpose since their human capital is not<br>
worthe the trouble.  so i would say that this affects your second last<br>
statement:  you ARE trusting the powerful to be wise, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And as i</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;showed before, Gates could do this with just using his profits.  (And if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you don't like the numbers, change the 10000000 indians for 1 million</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;indians, the actual number is inconsequential to the argument as long as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that number reaches Shocking Proportions (tm))</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ... but in that case, perhaps you'd best consider that right now he could</i><br>
<i>&gt; just as easily purchase some attack helicopters from a defense contractor</i><br>
<i>&gt; (he could afford it), renounce citizenship in the United States, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; bribe the current Indian government into not stopping him as he razes their</i><br>
<i>&gt; cities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
i am not saying that he could not do it now, although i think he would<br>
have much more trouble in getting through it, personal ownership of attack<br>
helicopters is forbidden i think, so he would have to bribe people in the<br>
US, buy some kind of transport method, bribe every country he goes through<br>
with that transport, and then bribe the indian government, and i don't<br>
think that last one is going to be an easy bribe.  i would say it would be<br>
a much more expensive exercise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As Clark pointed out, if Bill Gates suddenly decided to stop at nothing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill you or me or 10 million people out in India, we'd ALL be in serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble, especially under our current political system.  Anarcho-capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't be able to put a stop to this sort of thing; it is not utopian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, at least under anarcho-capitalism the Indians could legitimately</i><br>
<i>&gt; employ someone else before Bill Gates decided to launch his assault.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; would not have to support their corrupt government while they were under</i><br>
<i>&gt; attack.  As I see it, they would have a chance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
i would say the anarcho-capitalist system is the only one where they don't<br>
have any chance at all.  in the current system those 10000000 have a much<br>
greater leverage on india's army than in the PPA based one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I addressed this in my previous answer to your mail. The profit to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;current PPA is greater than the potential profit to the other PPA, etc...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which I also explicitly disproved.  People would pay at least as much if</i><br>
<i>&gt; not more for freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
you didn't disprove anything, you just seem to assume a huge package is<br>
attached to the words "freedom" and "tyrannical" (which i never used in my<br>
description of the PPA's action, BTW).  In this context, tyrannical just<br>
means they make you pay more than you want to pay, which, if you switch<br>
some other "more liberal" PPA which makes you pay more, it still fulfills<br>
this definition of "tyranical".  so please, don't use words that have<br>
everyday meanings attached to them which do not fit in this scenario.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I don't see this at all.  War is expensive for both sides.  Your PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;doesn't have to fight anyone if no other PPA tries to "rescue you".  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;no other PPA will try because they know that your PPA gets a higher profit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from you than they would (since that is the point of your rescue,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This, I repeat, is simply untrue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;otherwise they would try, and probably succeed, but this means that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would get more out of you than your current PPA).  Analogies with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;nation-states ad infinitum.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Though the conclusion to this point is telling.  They WOULD probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; succeed, because they WOULD get more out of you than your current PPA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's our whole point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
then how does that benefit you?  you are still paying more than you wanted<br>
to?  what was the point of the switch?  is this another assumption of the<br>
baggage attached to the word tyrannical which you were using to describe<br>
the current PPA?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Depends what you mean on "this whole land".  If you mean the US, i would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;say they get a very nice forced profit from you, and almost complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;autonomy from any civil law.  this is probably more profitable for them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than forcing a military dictatorship (they are tricky things to run, very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;personnel-intensive, and probably not worth the trouble).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The military gets paid well, but not half as well as they could be.  Not to</i><br>
<i>&gt; mention the fact that, at least for now, they only receive the wages which</i><br>
<i>&gt; the politicians allow them to receive.  There's no question, the military</i><br>
<i>&gt; would DEFINITELY profit by rejecting this policy and taking over the country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
"There's no question" and "DEFINITELY".  brilliantly supported argument.<br>
the first one is simply false, since i questioned it in the paragraph you<br>
were answering to, and "definitely" doesn't do much better.  so, i have to<br>
ask, how do you know? and how are you so sure?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Depends on your idea of freedom.  I don't see it as something only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;quantitavely rather than qualitatively different from the current state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not certain what you mean by this, but I can assure you that freedom is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not binary.  Someone at the point of a gun is more free than someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; physically strapped to the ground, but clearly less free than someone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't being threatened at all.  I see these as quantitative, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualitative changes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
i fail to see the relevance of this to the argument. sorry.<br>
