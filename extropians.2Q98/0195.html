Another issue that hasn't been mentioned here is what do you do when you<br>
don't have the source code? Several of the companies I've worked for have<br>
sold custom systems to big corporations, and later -- AFAIK -- gone bust. I<br>
don't think there was any kind of arrangement to escrow sources, as we have<br>
sometimes done in other cases.<br>
<p>
Now I think those systems are perfectly Y2K compliant (though probably <br>
not Y2038), but there must be many other organizations who rely on this <br>
kind of software. It's one thing to say 'well, these organisations will <br>
fix their code before Y2K', but how can they do it if they don't have the<br>
code to fix? The only solution is to try to hold it together until they <br>
can create a new system from scratch; odds are there are only a few lines<br>
to fix, but without the source code you're stuck.<br>
<p>
Worse are the 'smart' embedded controllers, which will shut down equipment<br>
if it hasn't been serviced regularly. If they're not Y2K compliant then on<br>
Jan 1st they see it hasn't been serviced for a century and that's that. In<br>
this case you may be able to reset the date as a temporary solution, but if<br>
not, and the manufacturer isn't proactive about upgrading, you may be waiting<br>
days for a software fix. This seems to be a particular problem with medical<br>
equipment, presumably for liability reasons.<br>
