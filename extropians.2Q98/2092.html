On an IBM compatible type of PC (i386, i486 Pentium etc etc) running Windows<br>
(any version) or DOS (any version) there is no way to infect it with a virus<br>
just by 'putting it in the drive' without any other action.<br>
<p>
You need to execute a virus in order for it to infect your computer.  Just<br>
putting a disk into a drive on a normal PC will not cause any data on the<br>
disk to be executed.  You need to boot from it or execute it or almost<br>
anything else - but simply putting it into a drive can't hurt anyone.<br>
<p>
Or have a look at the Nashsoft Anti Virus Research Center and tell me which<br>
type of virus you believe you have so I can find out more about this<br>
extraordinary feat.<br>

<p>
If you find that putting it into your drive causes a warning message from<br>
your anti-virus software to appear then clearly your anti-virus software is<br>
running in background and noticed the hardware notify the system of a<br>
disk-change and decided to do a bit of pre-emptive scanning of it's own.<br>

Sticking this<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

old<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; not.</i><br>

(who was<br>

series of<br>

virus to<br>

state where I<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; i think that the stealth virus you've got is a boot sector virus, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; AFAIK, not all stealth virii are, by definition, boot sector virii.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yeah, the main reason I thought that it was was because it made a write</i><br>
attempt to the<br>
<i>&gt;boot sector of my hard drive, and the antivirus software database said that</i><br>
virii of<br>
<i>&gt;the Stealth C family are boot sector virii.</i><br>
