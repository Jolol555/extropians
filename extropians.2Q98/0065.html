At 03:47 AM 4/3/98 +0200, you wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;Others have already criticized the anarco-capitalist PPA model but I'll ad my</i><br>
<i>&gt;$ 0.10 anyway:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First of all, how do you want to achieve a state of anarchy? After all,</i><br>
the nation<br>
<i>&gt;states aren't going to roll over and die just like that. Not until the</i><br>
Powers get<br>
<i>&gt;them, but by then *all* our ideas about society will be obsolete.</i><br>
<p>
Financial cryptography may be one important step...  but I don't think even<br>
the most pronounced advocates of anarcho-capitalism have a step by step<br>
plan to bring it about.  Most anarcho-capitalists I know favor a gradual<br>
movement towards libertarianism, then simply continuing the privitization<br>
process until there's nothing left.  No collapse, no widespread chaos, no<br>
period of anarchy as you know it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Even if you could achieve widespread (all major nations must co-operate, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;you'd just be invaded "for your own good") anarchy, how do you prevent it</i><br>
<i>&gt;from becoming one big mess a la Mad Max? </i><br>
<p>
Have you been reading?  If people don't want society to look like Mad Max,<br>
then they'll pay money to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How do you prevent PPAs (basically bands of armed thugs) from developing</i><br>
<i>&gt;the characteristics of the mob, feudal lords or regular governments?</i><br>
<p>
There is no way.  How do you prevent the US armed forces from taking over<br>
the nation and turning it into a military dictatorship?  How, especially<br>
when the groups holding the guns are (almost exclusively) working for the<br>
government?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Remember,</i><br>
<i>&gt;most people are *afraid* of real freedom and personal responsibility, they</i><br>
don't<br>
<i>&gt;want it, and even if they want it they usually don't know how to defend</i><br>
it.  They<br>
<i>&gt;are easy prey for any power structure that survived the colaps of the</i><br>
nation states<br>
<i>&gt;like (parts of) army units and criminal organizations.</i><br>
<p>
You're presuming that this would involve a violent uprising and a collapse<br>
of the institutions we hold most dear, and then (cross your fingers!)<br>
anarcho-capitalism rises up from the rubble.  <br>
<p>
But what if rather than a collapse, it was just a slow process of<br>
privitization?  Not only would this not lead to chaos, it would also very<br>
likely improve the material welfare of everyone in the nation every step of<br>
the way.<br>
<p>
So in one respect, I agree; I also think that a totalitarian regime would<br>
likely take control if the US government fell tomorrow.  For that very<br>
reason, I advocate slow privitization, not instantaneous collapse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or, like in the good old days, with brute force. Guess who has the privelege</i><br>
<i>&gt;of being the foot soldier?</i><br>
<p>
What happens now when disagreements happen between nations, or even between<br>
many governments and citizens?  Guess who has the privelege of being the<br>
foot soldier?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yet the only reason these contracts have any value is because there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;big government to keep an eye on things, to provide a civilized context.</i><br>
<p>
Those contracts, yes.  These new contracts would be more comparable to<br>
national peace pacts; except in order to prove their worth, PPAs might<br>
offer some form of collateral to show that they'll actually abide by their<br>
laws.  ("How do we know that you'll keep your word?"  "My trustworthy<br>
arbitration agency has a copy of $100M of my money.  If that court awards<br>
you restitution, they have the ability to give it to you without my consent.")<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So why not try to commercialize and smoothen up the court system</i><br>
<i>&gt;(and everything else) instead of abolishing them (so that they may sneak</i><br>
<i>&gt;back under a different name).</i><br>
<p>
What do you mean by commercialize?  Do you mean privatize?  If so, then you<br>
already know that this is EXACTLY what I'm suggesting.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suppose somthing like this could be incorporated into a centralized system </i><br>
<i>&gt;too...</i><br>
<p>
There's no rule saying that centralized systems of government CAN'T do<br>
whatever a market would do, but at that point, why not just let the market<br>
do it, and save yourself the time and money?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Civil behaviour through threat of force can also be achieved by allowing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizens of a nation-state to keep and bear arms. I personally think that </i><br>
<i>&gt;we would see more and worse violence in anarchy than in a centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt;society. In fact, a nation state with good electronic surveillance and the</i><br>
right<br>
<i>&gt;to keep &amp; bear arms would be quite peaceful, with only sporadic crime</i><br>
<i>&gt;as opposed too the relatively safe patches of civilization surrounded by</i><br>
<i>&gt;dangerous thug-filled wastelands that are typical for anarchy.</i><br>
<p>
Please, remember, we're not talking immediate collapse of governments,<br>
we're talking privitization...<br>
<p>
And another point:  if your plan for government really is the most<br>
cost-effective, then it will be the plan which most profit-minded PPAs will<br>
choose.  What would be wrong with that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the past, when the world was more anarcho-capitalistic than it is now,</i><br>
justice<br>
<i>&gt;*was* something for the rich, and people would risk their lives as</i><br>
enforcers for<br>
<i>&gt;a fraction of today's price because human life wasn't worth much anyway, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;one has to eat after all... Why would it be different the second time around?</i><br>
<p>
When precisely are you thinking of?  When and where in history have there<br>
been multiple legitimate police forces competing for customers?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you were rich, I'm sure you could buy "perfect" justice for yourself</i><br>
and your <br>
<i>&gt;relatives in your new world (dis)order. But if you're not...</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  Go back and reread.  If you try to buy your own justice, you'll<br>
have to pay through the nose for it.  Not only is it not worth it, but<br>
you'll also lose if there's a sufficient number of PPAs competing against you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Anarchy" in any form is unstable (it's simply a power vacuum), and sooner</i><br>
<i>&gt;or later will give rise to new "nations", most of which are sure to be</i><br>
ruled by<br>
<i>&gt;dictators. As far as I know, no serious democracy has ever decided to kill</i><br>
<i>&gt;of half (or any substantial portion) of its own people. I'm no great fan of </i><br>
<i>&gt;democracy, but considering human nature I think it's better than anarchy.</i><br>
<p>
Military generals and the local police force haven't really tried to snatch<br>
power by force in the US, so far.  I put it to you that there is nothing<br>
preventing them from doing so.  So what's keeping them from filling this<br>
so-called "power vacuum?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That depends on how pissed off and/or rich I am...Since there's only your PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt;to deal with instead of a huge government that's all over I might try to</i><br>
take you <br>
<i>&gt;out either myself or I may hire as many destitute souls as my budged allows </i><br>
<i>&gt;to do it for me.</i><br>
<p>
Except that I'm much more invested in preserving myself than you are in<br>
squishing me.  Face it, even if you COULD do such a thing, it's certainly<br>
not worth it to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By the way, slander would be punishable by fines and a public</i><br>
<i>&gt;excuse, not torture. But of course this only applies to centralized nation</i><br>
states...<br>
<p>
Who says?  Why couldn't PPAs have a similar legal structure, especially if<br>
it's the most cost-efficient?<br>
