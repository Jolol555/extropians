<p>
No, however, when they purchase a copy of my product, they are agreeing to not copy that product<br>
beyond what I allow them. I don't have to sell my product to anyone who does not agree to those<br>
conditions, and anyone who does is in breach of contract and can be sued. In order to buy my product<br>
you must agree that it belongs to me and that you are only purchasing a right to use it, a lease, per<br>
se, rather than purchasing all rights to the product.  I am quite comfortable with this distinction,<br>
and it has nothing to do with IP as a concept of 'natural law'. IP as a concept of contract law is<br>
quite sufficient. I think that where we are talking past each other is that you look at IP as a<br>
consequence of natural law, and I look at it as a consequence of contract law.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is why it is most important to enforce property rights on it. This is why the word is COPY</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; - RIGHT, or right to copy, get it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I know perfectly well what it is, and think that it should not exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Would it be too much to ask that we maintain a higher level of ettiquette</i><br>
<i>&gt; here?  I don't insult YOUR intelligence every chance I get.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I just don't understand how someone who claims to be intelligent could come to such a nutty<br>
conclusion. I hear your arguments all too often from many people, and they invariably turn out to be<br>
cheapskates who want to get something for nothing. As you can tell by my sigline, I don't have much<br>
respect for such people, and if I have transferred that disrespect toward you by association when it<br>
may be unwarranted, accept my apologies. However if it does turn out to be warranted, please don't<br>
take it personally....I'm an equal opportunity hater.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is important because information is very easy to reproduce, while much more substantive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; products are not so easy to reproduce. Especially with software, if there is no way an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individual or company can hope to get paid for its software, if the first person to buy a copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; goes out and gives away copies to everyone, then there will be no incentive to produce software</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and the industry will die, or at least become severely retarded.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; On the contrary; all this means is that the price of copies will plummet,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and as a result more people will buy the product who wouldn't before.</i><br>
<p>
If there is no incentive to produce new technology, then economic growth will come to a screeching<br>
halt. If everyone can copy whenever they want, then the product will no longer be bought, but<br>
shared.  it would be interesting to see the welfare lines in Silicon Valley after that happens.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (This is the 40-50% of the copy market to which I have been referring.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; The market [for copies!] will GROW, not shrink, because the law of demand</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictates that when prices fall, quantity demanded increases.  Meanwhile,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the number of new inventions will decrease; I argue that the copy market,</i><br>
<i>&gt; coupled with the cost of enforcement, will outweigh this loss.</i><br>
<p>
However, when prices fall beyond a certain point, it is no longer profitable for a producer to<br>
produce a product and will go out of business. When a product can be freely copied, there is no<br>
longer a market for the product.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; So you admit that it is a severe disincentive against invention, if an inventor is guarranteed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to have his invention stolen the minute it goes public. How many people will be able to devote</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their lives unselfishly to producing software when they have no hope of being compensated for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the undertaking? Far Far fewer than those at present.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not stolen.  He's selling copies.  People are doing whatever they</i><br>
<i>&gt; want with THEIR PRIVATELY OWNED COPIES.</i><br>
<p>
You still dont' seem to understand it. I do not sell you total rights to ownership of my product, you<br>
own the right to use the copy I produce for you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And YES, I'm aware that incentive will decrease and that invention will</i><br>
<i>&gt; decrease.  However, we will ALSO see an explosion in the copy market, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we will all save, as taxpayers, the cost of enforcing this law.  These two</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects will OUTWEIGH the decrease in invention...</i><br>
<p>
This is the central, incredibly outrageous hogwash of your entire argument. An economy cannot grow<br>
without advancing technology. With an increasing population and without rechnological advances to<br>
increase resource utilization efficiency, economic stagnation will quickly result, bringing us back<br>
to the dark ages.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And I replied that I think that you are out of your hat to think so...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ... and you have yet to provide an economic argument which counters that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, you completely FAILED TO RESPOND to any of my previous points,</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguing that you wanted to see real numbers.  Well, as I'm sure you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; aware, these numbers don't and CAN'T exist, because this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; MICROeconomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument; while I argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing intellectual property will hurt GDP, I'm not saying that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; country with IP protection will have less GDP growth than another nation</i><br>
<i>&gt; that doesn't.  Indeed, the best I can say is that ONE nation with IP will</i><br>
<i>&gt; do better if it stops protecting IP; because the behavior off one market</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot ever explain the behavior of the whole economy.</i><br>
<p>
Of course a nation that stops protecting IP will perform better, because it will be reducing its cash<br>
outflow to pay for intellectual property rights held in other nations. Thus, it is externalizing its<br>
costs to increase its net domestic product. It does not expand its gross domestic product except by<br>
the capital savings that result. In this case, your argument will only work if ONE or SOME nations<br>
fail to protect IP, as they then are externalizing their IP costs onto the economies of those that do<br>
respect IP. When ALL nations fail to respect IP, then technological development will halt and<br>
economic depression will result.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd like to prove this more vividly.  Let's take welfare for example.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Welfare sucks.  It hurts the poor more than it helps them, and drags down</i><br>
<i>&gt; our macroeconomy.  This can only be demonstrated through a MICROeconomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument: that it reduces efficiency thanks to distorted incentives which</i><br>
<i>&gt; lead to deadweight loss.  How much deadweight loss?  No one, not even the</i><br>
<i>&gt; best macroeconomist anywhere can tell you exactly how much.  It is NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply the dollar value of government expenditures on welfare, adjusted</i><br>
<i>&gt; for inflation.  It's actually much much larger than that.  Can you</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate this?  Can you show it using "real data?"  (hint:  any attempt</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do so must necessarily use theoretical data, in other words "uninformed</i><br>
<i>&gt; guesstimates," by your account.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If not, then a liberal could say to you:  "I don't need to show that</i><br>
<i>&gt; welfare is more ecnomically efficent than laissez-faire capitalism; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current state of our macroeconomy is my proof:  we're doing EXCELLENTLY.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, how to fix Social Security..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since we agree that welfare is bad, yet our economy is doing well, then it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is plausible, a priori, that IP may be bad, EVEN THOUGH our economy is</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing well.  And the ONLY way you can show this is with a MICROeconomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument, which you think you can gloss over.  Well, you can't.  I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; provided my microeconomic argument using sound market theories which WORK.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Care to provide your own?</i><br>
<p>
Yes. We can compare nations that respect IP and those that don't. Excepting the IP which those<br>
nations steal from other IP protecting nations, we can measure the economic growth which results from<br>
domestically developed IP. China is an excellent example. During its cultural Revolution, there were<br>
virtually no inventions developed in China, there was also zero economic growth. Once they opened<br>
their economy, they started stealing IP from western nations. We can extimate as a result that most<br>
of China's economic growth in the past 30 years is not due to domestic IP that is not protected, but<br>
by foreign IP which is stolen and are therefore externalized costs that boost the Chinese economy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You have yet to quantify any of your claims, probably because you cannot quantify those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; claims.... come back when you get real data...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have left myself a WIDE margin of error with 40%, using strong economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; principles which are completely valid in this example.  You'll never get</i><br>
<i>&gt; better data than that; nor could you provide such numbers if we DIDN'T</i><br>
<i>&gt; have IP and you were arguing for its creation.  One market cannot explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; the entire economy.</i><br>
<p>
Don't give me percentages, give me numbers. I'll bet that Sasha Chislenko's economic simulator will<br>
easily disprove your arguments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I work in the software industry, and it is easy to create fingerprints in data and in software.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The problem in the software industry is a refusal on the part of nations like china to enforce</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the laws they already have, because the pirates are top officials in the Communist Party.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No, the problem is that even if we DID have those fingerprints, (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; many products already do!) we'd have to monitor people's computers in</i><br>
<i>&gt; order to actually FIND THEM.  Couple that with the fact that a reasonably</i><br>
<i>&gt; competent programmer can disable fingerprint protection with a crack, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you've got a situation where in order to find the pirates, you'd have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; raid houses at random, violating our rights and wasting our time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; money.</i><br>
<p>
A reasonable competent fingerprint will make software not work at all if it is tampered with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; its more a matter of prosecuting those in the breach. An easy way for, say, Microsoft to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enforce its own copyright is to require that all resellers of Windows perform license checks on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; software on customers computers when the coputers are sent in for maintenance. I don't see any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reason why Apple, Microsoft, and IBM don't get together and adopt that as an OS industry</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; standard practice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, from here on we have a real interesting phenomenon.  Here's where I</i><br>
<i>&gt; provide my argument from microeconomic efficiency, and explain the</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between the microeconomy and the macroeconomy.  You just ignore</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  Funny that.</i><br>
<p>
You only make a microeconomic argument. You do not show anything about the macroeconomic systemic<br>
impact.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Granted they have gone up in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recent years, but only because we have opened our economy wide to the Chinese, who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no respect for intellectual property, nor any other type of property or individuality, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems. Rather than looking at pirating as a positive externality, look at the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enforcement as an externality created by pirates that everyone has to pay. If trade with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pirate economies were cut off, our cost of intellectual property enforcement would go</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Your logic is dizzying: the more the positive externality happens, (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; this is, by definition,) the more we have to pay to stop it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; happening!  Of course, if we weren't trying to pay for IP's enforcement,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; then we would circumvent that part of the problem entirely.</i><br>
<p>
If people merely acted in compliance with the contracts they sign, then there would be no IP<br>
enforcement costs. This goes back to my previous statements about subjectivity eroding respect for<br>
contract law. You are proposing that people who produce intellectual property should not be able to<br>
protect their interests with contracts, or that people should not be bound by such contracts. Once<br>
again you have exposed your subjectivist, post modern underbelly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have to date, only guessed. Since the current situation is one where intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; property is respected and enforced, I think that the onus is on YOU to prove your point</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with real numbers. Until you do, all we can think of your ideas is that they are quaint</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fantasy with no basis in fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Guessing?  Only so as to provide extra precision.  If you'd like I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; stick to being very general, based on what we already know.  We already</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; know that the cost to an individual of producing another copy of a piece</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of information is low, and that it does not increase significantly when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; lots of people are producing lots and lots of copies.  Therefore, we know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the production of copies is nearly completely elastic.  (HOW near is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; what I was trying to guess.)  Since the marginal revenue curve for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; monopolies is half of the demand curve, we know that it will strike the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; P=0 line at 0.5Q, where Q is the quantity demanded when P=0.  If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; marginal cost curve were completely elastic, then the market for copies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; would shrink by 50% thanks to monopolization.  Again, since it is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly completely elastic, deadweight loss is is only nearly 50%; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; guessed 40%, which gives me a large margin for error.</i><br>
<p>
If the curve is not a line, but truly curved, then it will not be 0.5Q, but some other number. It may<br>
be higher, it may be lower. In a commodity market, the curve makes this number very high, while in a<br>
monopoly market, the curve can be rather low. You are only using a standard 1 for 1 slope on the<br>
curve, which is inaccurate, disingenuous, and false.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, there's no question that the rate is affected. I agree: when the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; incentive goes up, invention goes up, and when incentive goes down,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; invention goes down.  That's not what I'm on about.  What I'm saying is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; this:  we know both that the market for copies is slashed by at least 40%</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; when IP is enforced, and that the cost of enforcement is non-trivial.  Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; monopolization's deadweight loss plus the cost of enforcement GREATER than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; or LESS than the deadweight loss due to decreased invention?  I say</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; greater; you know why.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Considering that you have refused to respond to my refutation of your assertion that an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invention is a monopoly, your argument does not stand. Any engineer will tell you that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are always many many ways to solve a problem. Only problems are unique. Invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not a monopoly market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; We must assume that the engineer's ability to route aroun IP is not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; significant effect, otherwise IP has NO economic effect at all: whenever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; you try to patent your idea, I invent another one just like it and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; gain nothing.  If this is true, then the only difference in costs between</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; enforcing IP and not enforcing IP is the cost of enforcement; and that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; in MY favor, not yours.</i><br>
<p>
A patent is worth more if it is as broad as possible. The most broad patents are concept patents,<br>
while the most narrow are design patents. Even in design patents, an engineer will try to include as<br>
many designs as possible, to shut out competition from routing around his property very easily. Even<br>
then it is usually only a matter of time before someone does. The main advantage that a patent gives<br>
an inventor or the company he licenses is product to is time enough to establish market presence and<br>
fine tune production systems. Once you have established brand name presence in a market and have<br>
refined your production system, usually, there is competition on the market using alternative<br>
technology.<br>
<p>
The purpose of the patent is to give the inventor (individual or corporation) the time to recoup the<br>
capital costs of research and development, as well as the capital costs to establish a production<br>
capacity. Failure to allow an inventor to recoup these costs is externalizing the costs from the<br>
consumer to the inventor and producer and therefore stagnating technological development.<br>
<p>
In an expanding population, with stagnant economic growth and zero technological development, the<br>
resource base shrinks steadily (since technology is no longer increasing resource utilization<br>
efficiency or reducing resource acquisition costs).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, if we assume that IP cannot be so easily routed around, as we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; must if we think IP will have any effect, then we must observe that IP is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; by its very definition, granting the inventor monopoly rights over copies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of their idea.  This is how we define IP; there isn't any argument to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; made here.  And, since in this market copies are cheap and supply is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; elastic, the market for copies suffers at least 40% losses thanks to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; monopolization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't need to. The present economy is my own proof. YOU need to come up with proof that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; economic growth would be higher without such protections. That the US has one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; highest levels of intellectual property protections, along with among the top 3 or 4 per</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; capital incomes/standards of living, and among the highest economic and productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; growth rates for a nation at its state of development (a third world with a 50% growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rate doesn't mean anything if they are starting from nothing.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm making a MICROecnomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument.  As you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; well know, there are hundreds of thousands of effects which have positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and negative effects on the economy, many of which are present in the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and not in other areas (or vice versa).  The only macroecnomic argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; which I can present is that microeconomic efficiency, as a trend, leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; towards greater GDP.  However, the behavior of one market can never be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; used to predict the behavior of the economy as a whole.  Microeconomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; markets tend to clear and/or equilibrate; they have no business cycle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The macroeconomy is practically the antithesis of this model.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, static microeconomic models are no good at all at predicting the impact of changes in<br>
technological advancement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; If I am right, then IP is just one of the galaxy of factors which hold</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; America back from greater growth, none of which alone could possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; explain our growth rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, theft is when someone benefits from someone else without that persons permission or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acquiescence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; If there are no IP rights, and the inventor invents despite knowing this,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; then the inventor has, by necessity, acquiesced.</i><br>
<p>
If the inventor has invented and has only licensed use of his product to others, and those others<br>
violate the terms of that license contract, then they are stealing. He has asquiesced to nothing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; OK, we're back.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, how does this sound:  I declare that individuals have a right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; their physical property and energy, and that anyone has the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; organize their property in any way they want, even if they organize their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; property just like someone else's property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Doesn't sound very collectivist to ME.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How does someone else know exactly how someone else organize their property?? If they haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; paid for the product (i.e. the information about the other person) then they cannot organize</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their property the exact same way, can they?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Too true!  So I had best BUY a copy of your manuscript, and then, using my</i><br>
<i>&gt; property, organize my property just like the copies that belong to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You own the manuscripts and all of the words written on them; but if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; sell a copy to me, then I own a copy, with all the words written on it.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can do with my property whatever I please, including organizing my</i><br>
<i>&gt; property just like your property.</i><br>
<p>
If I sell you the right to use my copy. You can use my copy to organize your own property any way you<br>
want, however you cannot sell copies of the copy I sold you to anyone else.  If you sell the copy I<br>
sold you to someone else, and delete all copies of that copy that may reside anywhere in your own<br>
property, then it is not theft....since if you sell the copy to someone else, you are selling them<br>
your right to use that copy.<br>

<i>&gt; I think we're using different words to say the same thing.  Society</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't have the right to own property.</i><br>
<p>
I dunno, the state owns plenty of property. As a sovereign government, in theory it holds original<br>
right to all real property in its domain. People only own real property (i.e. real estate) as granted<br>
by the sovereign in granted deeds. The sovereign holds right to reclaim those deeds under emminent<br>
domain, provided the deed holder is refunded the original license fee, plus interest and compensation<br>
for any improvements to the property.<br>
<p>
In a theoretical libertarian society, where every man is sovereign, and is vassal to no state,<br>
emminent domain would not exist per se, however IP will still exist in contract law. If you wish to<br>
benefit from my product, you must agree to not reproduce my product. If you break that contract, you<br>
are in breach and can be prosecuted in civil court by my PPL. Others who benefit from your breach can<br>
also be sued, ad nauseum. It may take some precendent cases in a libertarian society, but IP will<br>
probably be better respected in such a society then it even is currently here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Individuals do.  The sum of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth owned by individuals is not the property owned by society, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; simple sum of the property owned by those individuals.  I think we're</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreed on that.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, however you forget the origination of those properties. In the example of real estate, the<br>
sovereign holds all original rights to all real estate in his or her or its domain. all other land<br>
holders posess their land by granted deed.<br>
<p>
In an information economy, I invented widget A, or software B. I hold original sovereign rights to<br>
that widget or that software. I will only grant others the right to use copies of that widget or<br>
software if they agree to the terms in my granted deed to use that property. If they do not, I hold<br>
the right, by deeded contract, to prosecute their breach as I see fit. I could simply sue them in<br>
civil court, have it 'corrected' by a contract 'fixer', or simply go and nuke the bastids.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In light of that, your statement above is not correct: otherwise we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; forced to say that the sum of the property owned by individuals IS proprty</i><br>
<i>&gt; owned by society.  However, we both agreed that society HAS no rights,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially not the right to own property, only the individuals have these</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights.  Therefore, the sum of the property owned by individuals is NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; the property owned by society.</i><br>
<p>
That society may hold property as a sovereign government,  if individuals in that soceity are not<br>
sovereign individuals, with some or all rights delegated to the state, then the state can own<br>
property in trust for the benefit of all society.  THis is how things are presently. In a libertarian<br>
society, individuals would only delegate those rights which they choose to delegate on an individual<br>
basis.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Similarly, I assert that we should maximize the sum of the utility for</i><br>
<i>&gt; each individual; NOT the utility of the society, which is not a brain and</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore has no utility.  If I were arguing that society DID have</i><br>
<i>&gt; utility, THAT would be collectivist.  THAT would be Borg-like.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fortunately for the both of us, I'm not saying that at all.</i><br>
<p>
Yes you are. You are measuring the utility of IP protection as a sum set, i.e. for all soceity. You<br>
are not measuring it on an individual basis.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Destroying the incentive to invent destroys the utility of every thinking mind. Destroying the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; value of the thinking mind makes a human nothing but another animal that can be penned,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; harnessed, and slaughtered at will....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Slaughtered at will, eh?  This is either some weird hyperbole, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; obscure attempt at a reductio ad absurdum proof, or a gross</i><br>
<i>&gt; misunderstanding of my argument.  Obviously, I do NOT think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals ought to be slaughtered at will.  Nor do I think it's OK to</i><br>
<i>&gt; take away static property.  I don't believe IP exists, or to put it</i><br>
<i>&gt; another way:  I don't think that we should enforce the concept of IP,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it does not maximize the sum of the utility of the individuals in</i><br>
<i>&gt; society.</i><br>
<p>
You are talking about society again.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Monopolization objectively leads to deadweight loss.  I have argued that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the law is bad for this reason.  Now it's time for you to show how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; deadweight loss under my system is bigger than the deadweight loss under</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; your system as well plus the cost of enforcement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't need to. I have the present system as my proof. Since your system is the new one, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; need to do the quantification comparing the two. Rough percentages and uninformed guesstimates</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do not cut it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you would REPLY to my argument, rather than gloss over it, then I could</i><br>
<i>&gt; show you that my argument is NOT uninformed, but rather leaves a wide</i><br>
<i>&gt; margin for error.  If you had only read what I had said about</i><br>
<i>&gt; microeconomic vs. macroeconomic arguments, you would understand that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current state of the economy is NOT evidence that IP is working, any more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than it proves that welfare and social security are working (and they sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; as heck aren't).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree with the CONCEPT of your economci argument. I think that your numbers are completely wrong.<br>
Failure to protect IP will lead to the downfall of technological society.<br>
