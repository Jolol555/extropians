At 07:09 AM 5/18/98 -0400, you wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Science would be</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
For the common (non-scientist) person, this is "true". Truth is what they<br>
believe, not necessarily what can be proven by rigorous methods of<br>
experiment and repetition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(I think these adjectives are misleading.  Truth is truth.  The adjectives</i><br>
<i>&gt;should merely describe methods of arriving at it, BUT we must be careful</i><br>
<i>&gt;because some methods -- e.g., observation, induction, inference,</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientific experiment -- work or work better than others -- e.g., reading</i><br>
<i>&gt;tea leaves, using a Magic 8 ball.  In this vein, it might be safe to say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is no such thing as tea leaf truth or Magic 8 ball truth.  Both of</i><br>
<i>&gt;those methods do not arrive at or validate truth.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
We need the adjectives to distinguish the non-objective 'truth' from the<br>
scientific. The definitions commonly accepted force this. There's religious<br>
truth, scientific truth, etc. Those not trained in science will need the<br>
adjectives to be able to shift gears..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I know that history writing is often very biased and that objective</i><br>
methods of<br>
<i>&gt;historiography are not usually even sought (but see Fischer's _Historians'</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fallacies_).  Even so, eyewitnesses (biased as they are) often leave behind</i><br>
<i>&gt;lots of evidence.  Eyewitnesses can be very biased because they typically</i><br>
<i>&gt;have more of a stake in how events are recorded and interpreted.  Look at</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thucydides' _The Peloponnesian War_.  Far from sticking to an objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;account, at every turn, he presents his view of why the events happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
And eyewitnesses have been shown in psychological experiments to be dead<br>
wrong in many cases. The historian's job is to make sense of all the<br>
available inputs without putting too much of his own opinion into the mess..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Losers do write a lot history.  I know you wrote "... winners usuallyy[sic]</i><br>
<i>&gt;write the &gt;history books..." but even this qualification of that cliche</i><br>
does not<br>
<i>&gt;go far enough.  We know, e.g., most Japanese history books have a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;slanted account of WW2 -- despite the fact that Japan lost and was</i><br>
<i>&gt;occupied.  Another example: both Afghan Wars in the last century.  While</i><br>
<i>&gt;Afghan versions of this war exist, many British accounts also exist.  A</i><br>
lot of<br>
<i>&gt;scholarship is based on the latter.  We should not forget, the losers here --</i><br>
<i>&gt;the British -- not only wrote most of the history, but were by no means a</i><br>
<i>&gt;uniform camp.  They disagree with each other over the import of the war.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The losers in this case were much more powerful in the Western world, so<br>
their interpretation is going to be more easily accepted by other<br>
Westerners. Just hemispheric chauvinism..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Marxists have, in a sense, lost in history (for now and getting them to admit</i><br>
<i>&gt;it might be very hard), yet their ideology still dominates historical</i><br>
<i>&gt;scholarship.</i><br>
<p>
Why has socialism always been such a darling of academia? I never<br>
understood the apparent need for otherwise learned people to denigrate the<br>
society that empowered them to achieve their positions..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My point here is that losers don't just write a small amount of history.</i><br>
They<br>
<i>&gt;write a large portion of it.  The Marxist example is important because I bet</i><br>
<i>&gt;Marxists put out more history books than historians of any other ideological</i><br>
<i>&gt;persuasion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
They had very powerful propaganda organs, all right..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, losers change a lot.  In 1811, Fance might have been considered the</i><br>
<i>&gt;winner in Europe.  5 years later, that judgment would have been seen as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;little off.:)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Back to objective methods, I think it is still possible to retreive many</i><br>
facts<br>
<i>&gt;and objective interpretations of such from them.  That, e.g., we have an</i><br>
<i>&gt;Egyptian tablet and an Hittite tablet telling us of their war (at Kadesh?  My</i><br>
<i>&gt;memory fails me at this hour), even though both accounts claim that their</i><br>
<i>&gt;side won let's us know a war did happen.  Combines with other evidence,</i><br>
<i>&gt;we know neither side was able to wipe out the other -- else no treaty AND</i><br>
<i>&gt;either side's culture would have taken over the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
And so we can look into the ancient records and enjoy endless speculation<br>
over what really happened. If we ever achieve time travel or some means of<br>
actually seeing into the past, I bet we end up disappointed with how<br>
mundane the glorious past really was..<br>
