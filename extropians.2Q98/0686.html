Thank you very much, Til, for this piece of advice. Amazon sells the <br>
second edition, co-authored with Charles van Doren. My copy arrived a few <br>
days ago, and I have found it to so extraordinarily useful in that short <br>
time that I'd like to add my own praise.<br>
<p>
As an example of the benfits, I gave A. G. Cairns-Smith's book, "Seven <br>
Clues to the Origin of Life", what Adler terms an "inspectional" reading <br>
last night. I got a great deal out of a 40-50 thousand book in only 25 <br>
minutes. Most importantly, I understood that I wish to go back and give <br>
the book a much deeper, "syntoptic" read. When I do give the book the <br>
syntoptic read it deserves, my level of reading will be much deeper and <br>
more engaged than it would have otherwise been.<br>
<p>
I truly had no idea how much there was to learn about reading until I <br>
started reading this book. Obviously, I'm having a ball with it, and can <br>
only imagine that all but the very best of readers would find a wealth of <br>
new information in the book. The only "drawback" of the book I've found <br>
so far is that my mind comes  so alive while making use of the book that <br>
sleeping becomes very difficult. That's a difficulty I'm happy to live with.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>

PS: Er, sorry if that all sounds like the sort of testimonial you see in <br>
    an advertisement for steak knives. I'm wildly enthusiastic about this <br>
    book...<br>
