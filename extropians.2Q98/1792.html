Research shows that socialisation is actually one of homeschooling's biggest<br>
benefits.  When you meet kids that have been home educated you're always<br>
amazed at the maturity and poise they display.   There are many reasons for<br>
this but I won't go into detail here.  Suffice to say that your wife might<br>
want to question the social skills that are taught in 'traditional' schools<br>
instead.<br>
<p>
If you have a picture in your mind of home-education meaning that the<br>
learning goes on at home, think again.   Home is a great place for reading<br>
books and studying, but there is a big wide world out there for the kids to<br>
explore.  When a child spends their formative years out and about in the<br>
general community and learning social behaviour by that example, they<br>
generally end up better socialised than a child who was penned in for all<br>
those years.  Don't you think ?<br>
<p>
