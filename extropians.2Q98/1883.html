  Caloric restriction increases HDL2 levels<br>

Abstract<br>
  Caloric restriction (CR) prolongs the life<br>
  of rodents and other small animals, but the benefits of CR for primates and<br>
  people are as yet unknown, and mechanisms by which CR may slow<br>
  aging remain unidentified. A study of rhesus monkeys, Macaca<br>
  mulatta, is underway to determine if CR might prolong life span in primates<br>
  and to evaluate potential mechanisms for life prolongation. Thirty rhesus<br>
  monkeys in three age cohorts, restricted to 70% of ad libitum calorie intake<br>
  for 6-7 yr, were compared with 30 controls. Plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and<br>
  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoproteins and subfractions were measured<br>
  and compared with weight, percent fat, glucose, and insulin level. CR caused<br>
  decreased triglyceride levels in adult monkeys and increased levels of HDL2b,<br>
  the HDL subfraction associated with protection from atherosclerosis.<br>
  Multivariate statistical analyses showed that differences in lipid and<br>
  lipoprotein levels occurring with CR could be accounted for, at least in<br>
  part, by decreased body mass and improved glucose regulation. These studies<br>
  have used a novel dietary modification paradigm in nonhuman primates focused<br>
  on calorie reduction. Results suggest that CR, as mediated by its beneficial<br>
  effect on body composition and glucose metabolism, could prolong human life<br>
  by decreasing the incidence of atherosclerosis.<br>
