<i>&gt; Maybe you didn't recognise the names, though.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ray Kroc was a milkshake-making-machine salesman and repairman, and</i><br>

<i>&gt; Rich deVoss was a door-to-door soap salesman.  He owns half of Amway.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sam Walton sold various supplies to small-town general stores.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; created the WalMart chain. &lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a new factor that isn't acknowledged in your argument above,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that is that our confiscatory tax system has grown immeasurably</i><br>
<i>&gt; MORE confiscatory since the above gentleman were able to make their</i><br>
<i>&gt; fortunes.  In other words, it is much more difficult nowadays, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; greatly increased gov't taxation on our incomes and everything else</i><br>
<i>&gt; within sight, to save enough to go into one's own business.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In addition, inflation by the Federal Reserve has eaten away the value</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our money, drastically.  Just compare prices for a commodity from,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, the 50s to their present prices, and you will see just how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; purchasing power the dollar has lost.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, Charlotte, it really depends on what state you are in. While I<br>
would agree that, say, New York residents probably have little hope of<br>
saving enough for a business, places like Alaska, New Hampshire, Montana,<br>
S. Dakota, etc. are states with extremly low levels of state tax burden.<br>
While many real estate tax loopholes that people used to use to create<br>
businesses are closed,  the federal tax rates are lower on average than<br>
they were in the 60's and 70's.  If you can live in a state that has low<br>
taxes, its not that hard to save, and if you are able to save and put<br>
anything in stocks for a few years, you can do quite well.  My older<br>
brother, for instance, dropped out of college with nothing but a bad back<br>
and a lawn mower. Now he owns one of the largest property management and<br>
landscaping firms in New Hampshire. He was offered a goodly fraction of a<br>
million for his business this year (ten years since he started it with<br>
nothing). He also does quite well in the stock market.  He has never been<br>
given any support from anyone, no outside investors, and always pays 'cash<br>
on the barrelhead'.<br>
<p>
Another example is a freind of mine in Seattle, who spent three years<br>
programming at Microsoft, and saved enough to open the Linda Cannon<br>
Gallery, the hottest contemporary art gallery in Seattle.<br>
<p>
Then there is my freind Bill Boone. Say what you will about network<br>
marketers (and I've said my share as well, as I don't like most of them).<br>
Bill has been up and down  but dedicated to the business concept for 14<br>
years, working on different product lines, and in the last few years got to<br>
the point where he only works an hour or two a day to bring in several tens<br>
of thousands of dollars a month in income, with no overhead. He's a happy,<br>
energetic, and IMHO, a very extropic personality.<br>
<p>
These three people I know well, and am proud to say that they are my<br>
freinds.<br>
<p>
I have also known quite a few people who would fall in the category of<br>
'trust fund baby'. Invariably they are usually people who never quite<br>
measure up to the people who earned the money they live off of, and never<br>
seem to be quite motivated to do anything about it. Those that do earn some<br>
measure of success do not nearly attain the same level of ROI that people I<br>
know who start from nothing do, which entirely disproves the adage that you<br>
need money to make money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; These facts would make the gentleman's argument more true than false,</i><br>
<i>&gt; IMO.</i><br>
