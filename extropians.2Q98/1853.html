Abstract<br>
  High rates of potassium intake are associated with<br>
  protection from cardiovascular diseases in populations consuming primitive<br>
  diets and in vegetarians living in industrialized cultures. In studies in<br>
  humans and in animals, a strong inverse association between<br>
  potassium intake and hypertension and stroke has been<br>
  described. However, acceptance of the putative protective effect has been<br>
  limited by inadequate understanding of 1) long-term<br>
  potassium regulation, and 2) mechanisms by which small<br>
  changes in plasma potassium concentration may affect<br>
  development of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we present results<br>
  from analyses of long-term potassium regulation that<br>
  indicated 1) changes in potassium intake may result in<br>
  potassium concentrations from 3.1 to 4.6 mmol/l, and 2) when<br>
  the initial rate is below normal, potassium concentration is<br>
  very sensitive to changes in potassium intake rate. In<br>
  addition, we present results that provide bases for possible mechanisms by<br>
  which potassium may protect against cardiovascular diseases:<br>
  1) increases in potassium inhibit free radical formation<br>
  from vascular endothelial cells and macrophages; 2) elevation of<br>
  potassium inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle<br>
  cells; 3) platelet aggregation and arterial thrombosis are inhibited by<br>
  elevation of potassium; and 4) renal vascular resistance is<br>
  reduced and glomerular filtration rate is increased by elevation of plasma<br>
  potassium. We propose that elevation of dietary<br>
  potassium intake increases plasma potassium<br>
  concentration, thereby inhibiting free radical formation, smooth muscle<br>
  proliferation, and thrombus formation. As a result, the rate of<br>
  atherosclerotic lesion formation and thrombosis will be diminished. In<br>
  addition, we propose the increase in glomerular filtration rate will cause a<br>
  shift in the relationship between arterial pressure and sodium excretion that<br>
  will lead to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. By these actions, high<br>
  levels of dietary intake of potassium could provide the<br>
  observed protection against the cardiovascular diseases that have plagued<br>
  humankind since we began eating a modern high-sodium,<br>
  low-potassium diet. [References: 88]<br>
