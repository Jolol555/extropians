I fear it's bad form to reply to oneself, but I thought of two additions to<br>
my comments on cantons below:<br>
<p>
	I should have made clear that each canton's plebiscite would decide<br>
	for that single canton whether it would "belong" to the UK or the<br>
	Irish Republic.<br>
<p>
	As I learned from Daibhi O Croinin's _Early_Medieval_Ireland_<br>
	_400-1200_, which Jim Albea kindly lent me, multiple limited<br>
	sovereignties operating within the context of an overarching customary<br>
	law were distinctive features of pre-feudal Ireland.  The kings could<br>
	not override private contracts and were subject to laws that could be<br>
	changed only by assemblies.  A modernized version of that ancient<br>
	system, which has similarities to the early Icelandic semi-anarchy<br>
	lauded by David Friedman in _The_Machinery_of_Freedom_, could provide<br>
	less-bad-than-average government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't think this discussion is closely related to extropianism, but let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; try to turn it in that direction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe that most ancestors of pro-British residents of Northern Ireland</i><br>
<i>&gt; moved there centuries ago, indeed longer ago than the arrival dates of most</i><br>
<i>&gt; ancestors of current USA citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If some Choctaw were to point out to me, a fifth-generation Mississippian and</i><br>
<i>&gt; eleventh-generation Southron, that his folks were forcibly dispossessed of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; land beneath our feet and to say that jurisdiction therefore belongs to his</i><br>
<i>&gt; tribe's government, would Brian say that I should accept?  Note that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Choctaws, one of the "Five Civilized Tribes", had a well-written constitution</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a functioning government before the ethnic cleansing that opened</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mississippi to my folks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The idea that jobs currently done by government employees should instead be</i><br>
<i>&gt; done by private agencies chosen by each individual moves from idealism to</i><br>
<i>&gt; practicality when one considers the bloodshed that results from insistence</i><br>
<i>&gt; that every large geographic area should have a single sovereign power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I might prefer living under a modernized Choctaw government but would not</i><br>
<i>&gt; acknowledge a nationalistic assertion of the Choctaw right to rule and would</i><br>
<i>&gt; consider myself justified in resisting violently any violence employed by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypothetical Choctaw Republican Army.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Attempting to substitute voluntary, private arrangements for governments is</i><br>
<i>&gt; preferable to pushing for rule by one government over another.  Failing that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I favor the cantonments promoted by Loew and Kendall's _South_Africa:_The_</i><br>
<i>&gt; _Solution_.  By that standard, most governmental functions would devolve to</i><br>
<i>&gt; smaller areas of Northern Ireland--counties perhaps--and cantonal plebiscites</i><br>
<i>&gt; would determine whether London or Dublin would provide the few governmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; services that hadn't been devolved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; From: "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin" &lt;warrl@mail.blarg.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I see.  The IRA wants Northern Ireland partitioned into two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;sections, with one section falling under their rule (and,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;presumably, passing to the Irish government) and another section</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;going in some other direction (presumably remaining British)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;according to the will of those persons (presumably mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Protestants) who live there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;No, I am not talking about "British Forces".  I am talking about </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;PEOPLE.  Bartenders, farmers, housewives.  Who happen to, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;various reasons, prefer British rule, or at least prefer *not* to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;suffer the fate that the IRA would choose for itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No you do not "see". there will be no further partioning of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; kind, the IRA will not be the government, the current republican</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; govt will control ALL of Ireland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The PEOPLE you refer to are descendants of those deliberately</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; settled onto Irish soil by the British Government, to enforce their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rule, not unlike the British invasion of Iceland in WW II, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invaders every bit as much as the soldiers. Unlike the soldiers who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do not belong there, they would be free to remain, but under Irish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not British law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There will be no peace until this is so.</i><br>
