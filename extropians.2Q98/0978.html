DF&gt; Unless, of course, the robots are sentient, in which case you still pay<br>

<p>
Right.  But a system with non-sentient robots is preferable.<br>
<p>
The assumption I'm making is that people would like to avoid working if they<br>
can.  They would prefer to live by selling some economic resource other than<br>
their own labor.  (I know I would!)<br>
<p>
DF&gt; The burden of work could only be lifted if supply increased so fast that<br>
DF&gt; it outstripped the demand for labor.<br>
<p>
Or the demand for labor could decrease.  Or both.  The demand for labor could<br>
decrease due to the availability of capitial (i.e. robots) which can be<br>
readily substituted for labor.  And if we assume such robots can be<br>
mass-produced "on demand" in huge quantities by nanotech factories...<br>
<p>
This begs a more basic question.  An economy is a system for distributing<br>
limited resources among people with unlimited needs and wants.  But is it safe<br>
to assume that needs and wants are unlimited?  What if they aren't?  What if<br>
the number we are looking for is very large, but not infinite?<br>
<p>
Every time you add a sentient robot to the work force, you are adding<br>
production, but you are also adding a CONSUMER.  Then you need to add more<br>
robots to serve the needs and wants of those you already have.  It becomes a<br>
never-ending cycle!  Where does it stop?<br>
<p>
DF&gt; If I had to choose (from an economic standpoint) between creating<br>
DF&gt; mindless robot slaves or sentient robot employees, I would choose the<br>
DF&gt; sentient robots hands down.  A sentient robot could participate in the<br>
DF&gt; economy,<br>
<p>
And non-sentient robots couldn't?<br>
<p>
DF&gt; performing labor and buying goods,<br>
<p>
Why couldn't non-sentient robots do this?<br>
<p>
DF&gt; creating jobs and filling them,<br>
<p>
Of course, the non-sentient robots would also fill jobs, by definition.<br>
<p>
DF&gt; making everyone better off in the process.<br>
<p>
Same here.  The only difference is that the sentient robot also becomes a<br>
consumer.  We don't need more consumers.  I would rather let my non-sentient<br>
robot do the producing, and I'll do the consuming.<br>
<p>
DF&gt; Also, if you consider utility a form of wealth, as I do, then we can<br>
DF&gt; immediately see that a sentient robot would be able to create many kinds<br>
DF&gt; of wealth which a mindless slave could not; art, for example.<br>
<p>
What makes you so sure a non-sentient robot couldn't do this?<br>
<p>
DF&gt; Empathy.  Love.<br>
<p>
If you want to create sentient machines for this purpose, that's fine.  That<br>
seems to me like the moral equivalent of having children.  I'm only saying it<br>
doesn't make sense to create them for the purpose of doing work.  I've already<br>
admitted that I don't want to work; why should I want my children to?<br>
