You are right. He is right. The energy is given by:  e=h/x, or the Planck's<br>
constant divided by the wavelength. Gven this energy measurement, you can derive<br>
the mass value of a photon as a function of its energy, when that energy is<br>
translated at the end of the photon's trajectory, i.e. when it is absorbed. Its<br>
quantum 'mass' is given by m=h/xc^2. Because its energy can therefore be<br>
measured in terms of mass, it can be described as a particle in certain<br>
circumstances, i.e. when its kinetic energy is absorbed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is the rest energy of particles which HAVE mass;</i><br>
<i>&gt; photons don't.  The REAL relativistic equation is actually E^2 = p^2*c^2 +</i><br>
<i>&gt; m^2*c^4, where p here is the momentum, given by (g)^2*m^2*v^2 for normal</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles, where (g) is given by 1/(1 - v^2/c^2)^0.5.  Plug the equation</i><br>
<i>&gt; for momentum into the relativistic equation and you get E^2 = (g)^2*m^2*</i><br>
<i>&gt; v^2*c^2 + m^2*c^4.  Factor this and you can get E^2 = (g)^2*m^2*c^2*(v^2 +</i><br>
<i>&gt; c^2).  For very small velocities, v^2 + c^2 ~= c^2 and (g) ~= 1.  So we</i><br>
<i>&gt; get E^2 = m^2*c^4, or E = m*c^2.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, the approximations we make for the rest energy of slow moving</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles is completely wrong; for light, which has no mass, the second</i><br>
<i>&gt; term of the first equation drops off altogether, and we get E^2 = p^2*c^2,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or E = p/c.  The energy on a photon is given by h*f where f is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; frequency, so we can get f = p/h/c.  Using the definition of wavelength</i><br>
<i>&gt; that x = c/f, we get x = h*c^2/p.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We run up against a similar problem, however, when we do try to identify</i><br>
<i>&gt; the frequency (though very different from the one which you had originally</i><br>
<i>&gt; posited in your first post).  h and c are indeed constants, so the more</i><br>
<i>&gt; precisely you know a particle's wavelength the less precisely you know its</i><br>
<i>&gt; position.  Many people have taken the uncertainty principle to be saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; that were we to know the precise location of a photon, it would exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; EVERYWHERE; while this is often a useful way to think about it, this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not strictly correct.  A photon whose wavelength is known perfectly may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; said to exist *anywhere* in the entire universe; a photon whose position</i><br>
<i>&gt; is known perfectly must be said to have *any* frequency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Does this contradict the idea of Tarskian truth statements?  Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily.  Again, a large part of the reason who we have Heisenberg's</i><br>
<i>&gt; uncertainty principle is because particles move about in an apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; random way, bounded by certain probability functions (which are themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; very specific and well-defined).  So if we know the particle to exist at</i><br>
<i>&gt; precisely one location, its momentum will be completely *random*.  By</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition, no equation can predict the completely random; we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore state, a priori, what that momentum will be.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Does that mean that the blueness of a particle whose position is known</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectly is in an "ambiguous" state of blueness?  No, it means that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; particle is in a *random* state of blueness.  If you want to find out</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectly if it's blue or not, you'll have to measure its momentum</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectly, at which point it will have a perfectly random location.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The question is not the truth value at points well within boundries. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is what truth value to prescribe exactly at the border.  I will not try</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to extend the analogy to your macroscopic example,as feet are not point</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; particles and will overlap the border.  Photons, when well behaving, are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; point particles and do not cause this sort of confusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What truth value to prescribe precisely at the border will be given by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; proper definition; for example, if blue happens when the wavelength is</i><br>
<i>&gt; greater than or equal to 450, then not blue is anything less than 450.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; a particle's position is known precisely, it will have a random blueness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        The gist of my argument is that when attempting to map all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; statements (in a metalanguage) onto the world, wherever boundries are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; drawn there will be fundamentally unavoidable ambiguities.  At some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; point (in this case at the points of 540 and 560 nm), it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; impossible to give a truth value of either true or false.  I suppose if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you insist on maintaining the Tarskian diagram, you could say "le laser</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; est bleu' is Truly True or False, but I don't think this is what Tarsky</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; had in mind! If you find multivalence truly abhorrent, I find no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; objection to making a Tarskian diagram with three Truth values, True,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; False, and Ambiguous (or Not Applicable).  However, as I pointed out</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; above, the uncertainty principle would make Ambiguous the correct Truth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; value at every point (each photon may or may not be blue). While</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; accurate, it doesn't do much good to anybody.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not ambiguous, UNCERTAIN.  That's why they don't call it the ambiguity</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle and why they DO call it the uncertainty principle.  And despite</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fact that the blueness will be completely random, it WILL be either</i><br>
<i>&gt; blue or not blue, despite the fact that we cannot measure which while we</i><br>
<i>&gt; know the position perfectly.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, while the frequency of each photon cannot be measured with certainty, you<br>
can measure their average wavelegth with a certain amount of precision, with<br>
variance depending on the accuracy of your instrument. If the accuracy of your<br>
instrument that measures the average wavelegnth is less than +/- 1 nm, then you<br>
have created a bivalent situation, where there is Truth and Falsity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You could get around the problem of Ambiguity by redefining blue in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; terms of complex numbers, but your new defintion would not bear any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; relation to what anybody else thought of as blue.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I presume you are alluding to the Shroedinger equation, by which you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; say that something was blue if the probability function of its momentum</i><br>
<i>&gt; fell within certain well-defined boundaries.  Interestingly enough, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are right about the fact that it would not bear any relation to what we</i><br>
<i>&gt; call blue, but not because it involved complex numbers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The easiest way to explain this is with something like the Gaussian</i><br>
<i>&gt; distribution, better known as the bell curve.  Suppose for a moment that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you had a probability function which looked like the bell curve.  Its</i><br>
<i>&gt; width at the points of inflection would be the standard error (which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually the value which is used in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Using it, we are accustomed to saying that a particle's position, momentum</i><br>
<i>&gt; or whatever is given by the position of the absolute maximum value on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; graph, +/- the standard error.  490 +/- 5 nm, for example.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, chromaticity graphs typically measure the wavelength of light usually by<br>
the peak of the bell curve. Given that you have the vast majority of diffused<br>
light in the sky generated by nitrogen, and some oxygen, as well as particulate<br>
content (I doubt that Tarsky thought much about smog), then you can pretty much<br>
depend on the distribution bell curves for these two gasses overlayed and summed<br>
to determine the actual wavelength seen, depending on the angle of diffraction<br>
the sun is at relative to your present point on the earth. Given the sun's angle<br>
and the diffusion distribution curves, you can determine with quite a bit of<br>
precision whether or not the sky is indeed blue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, look at the bell curve again.  It is not bounded by these points;</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather &gt; 80% of its area falls within these boundaries; there is a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; chance that the particle, as described above, should have a wavelength of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 400nm, an even smaller chance that it should have a wavelength of 600nm,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a remote but non-zero probability that it should be 2nm.  If we were</i><br>
<i>&gt; to say that a particle was blue if its probability function met certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; well-defined criterion, then we would have to say that the above random</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles would be blue, despite the fact that their wavelength would</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree much more with purple or even red.  We'd still call it blue,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, because the probability of it having a wavelength that small or</i><br>
<i>&gt; that large was small.  In other words, an unlikely red is blue.</i><br>
<p>
The human eye tends to make its 'color' determinetion based on the peak of the<br>
bell curve, or in the case of multiple substances, like nitrogen and oxygen<br>
having offset bell curves with differing amplitudes, its a matter of averaging<br>
the two peaks together....<br>
