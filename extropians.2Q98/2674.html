&lt;&lt; y information you usually mean a sequence of bits, ie a string of 1s and<br>
 0s. A bit is an abstract thing, and must be encoded somewhere, eg on a<br>
 magnetic tape. Information does not provide meaning until you interpret it.<br>
 (It is possible for the same piece of information to provide multiple<br>
 interpretations, and can thus mean different things to different<br>
observers.)&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Hmmm... My first thoughts about what someone means about information would be<br>
that they refer to a set of facts about a thing, not a series of bits.  But I<br>
agree that one cannot derive information from something until and at the same<br>
point one derives a kind of meaning or significance from it.  <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; So maybe one should regard the interpretation as more fundamental that the<br>
 information. I like that because it gives you a more process oriented view<br>
 (its not as platonic). But then, given the right interpretation, an<br>
 interpretation itself can be interpreted as information. And we're kind of<br>
 back were we started...<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.  I think that there has to be information to be gained via<br>
interpretation.  In other words, there must be information before there can be<br>
any interpretation, but there cannot be interpretation without information (no<br>
matter how trivial it might be).<br>
