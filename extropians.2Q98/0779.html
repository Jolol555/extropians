   IAN: Even the new MGS images show the sharp edges. <br>
   BUT, now, even as they are sharp, they are not so<br>
   straight, and that's a key factor supporting a<br>
   natural conclusion. I think, as I said before,<br>
   the best case against the "face" (including all<br>
   things the in area) is that other, clearly natural,<br>
   formations have similar features, suggesting a<br>
   uniform geological phenomenon. Notice how most <br>
   hills in the area seem to have sharp-edged tops<br>
   and som fomrations have sharp sudden-rising slops.<br>
   These natural features tend strongly to define <br>
   most of the theorized to be artificial features.<br>
   As such, the "artifical theory" is fast sinking.<br>
<p>
   If we're to dismiss the artificial theory, we have <br>
   to do it properly, not with name calling and such.<br>
<p>
   One thing I think we can dismiss is the theory <br>
   that there's been a cover-up. I think that NASA <br>
   has made genuine images available and has responded<br>
   to public demand that they do so. Cydonia is the <br>
   foremost thing I see mentioned on their pages. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: What your saying is just false. I don't</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;   pyramids, claiming it is, but images of the </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;   made available to you, yet you seem to prefer </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Hoagland's error over the actual evidence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Reading comprehension time: "as far as I can see they're just optical </i><br>
<i>&gt;illusions *like Hoagland's pyramid image*." How could that sentence</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibly be referring to Hoagland's image and not the Viking image</i><br>
<i>&gt;you pointed out?</i><br>
<p>
   IAN: You were commenting on my comments of the lines<br>
   on the pyramid. The "like Hoagland's image" implies<br>
   that the Viking formations you referred to are the <br>
   same formations that Hoagland referred to, and since<br>
   you rejected the pyramids on the basis of what he <br>
   presented, there was no reason to assume otherwise.<br>
