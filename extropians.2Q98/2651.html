how<br>

have<br>
<i>&gt;"freedom of spirit".</i><br>
<p>
When I used this expression first, I just thought of the ability of taking<br>
own decisions. Maybe this was a language problem, as I told earlier, my<br>
english isn`t very good, so it`s quite hard for me finding the right words<br>
and constructions.<br>

<i>&gt;        &gt;Religion will lead you to meaning.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But I don't understand your meaning. Just one specific example where</i><br>
religion<br>

your<br>
<i>&gt;ideas than a thousand more vague platitudes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Well it`s hard to give an example to someone who is not really open to the<br>
theme. Religion (not every religion, in fact most may not)  can help you<br>
understanding better the parts of the world which are already explained by<br>
science.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Avoid the Bible if it grieves you so, but find some spirit — have</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;you tried Taoism?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As I've admitted before, at one time I thought all mystics were fools, then</i><br>
I<br>
<i>&gt;read a wonderful book written by a mystic Named Raymond Smullyan called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"The Tao is silent". I disagree with Smullyan on lots of stuff but the man</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;quite definitely not a fool.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn`t call Smullyan a mystic, but ok, if you do so, for you I`m<br>
probably a mystic too.<br>
Smullyan wrote many interesting and fascinating books and texts, so try<br>
reading!<br>
BTW, how many of you know D.R. Hofstadter?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I respect Taoism, at least as it was originally taught by Laotse, but then,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Taoism is not a religion. Unlike a religion Taoism asks profound questions</i><br>
<i>&gt;it does not provide vapid answers, it claims no revealed truth, it takes no</i><br>
<i>&gt;position on the existence of God and doesn't even have a position on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth of Taoism. If you want to call something like that a religion then</i><br>
I'm<br>
<i>&gt;a religious man.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I`d call something like that a religion. It seems the main thing you connect<br>
with religion is lying, and the famous religions like christianity. I<br>
connected the word religion with things which can`t be explained by science.<br>
