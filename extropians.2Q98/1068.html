<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That "socialist fallacy" falls very closely in line with historical fact in</i><br>
<i>&gt; many industries, particularly those which depend upon huge capital</i><br>
<i>&gt; investments.  Banking, for example.</i><br>
<p>
Where, we observe, no monopoly has ever come into being, or been <br>
sustained, without government intervention to protect it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; KG&gt; But, in fact, no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; KG&gt; established by means of free trade on a free market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And if anyone finds an example -- such as Microsoft -- then we'll ignore it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; since it does't fit into our theory.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, there are two things more important than our theory that it <br>
doesn't fit:<br>
<p>
   * the definition of "monopoly"<br>
 <br>
   * the definition of "coercive".<br>
<p>
<p>
  Although to be fair, Microsoft's<br>
<i>&gt; monopoly *is* enforced by the power of the US Government, in the form of many</i><br>
<i>&gt; copyrights and software patents.  Just imagine how quickly Microsoft would</i><br>
<i>&gt; crack down in the courts on any company that produced a MS-Windows compatible</i><br>
<i>&gt; OS!</i><br>
<p>
We don't have to imagine this, as an operating system exists which is <br>
(a) substantially compatible with MS Windows, (b) substantially <br>
superior to MS Windows, and (c) substantially less expensive than MS <br>
Windows.<br>
<p>
It is distributed worldwide via a wide variety of channels, <br>
including in the US where it can be picked up even in bookstores (new <br>
*and* used).  <br>
<p>
I hear that the Red Hat release 5.0 is even easier to install than <br>
Windows95.<br>
<p>
Microsoft has initiated no court action.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Microsoft *obviously* have a monopoly.</i><br>
<p>
Monopoly: the circumstance of being ahead of most of the competition, <br>
and running as fast as you can in hopes of staying there.<br>
<p>
Have you told the US Federal Trade Commission about this new <br>
definition?  It'd be a nice addition to their collection (which <br>
already includes "the condition of being the tenth-largest company in <br>
a market" and "the condition of not being in a market at all").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  No other company is legally able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce operating systems compatible with the huge majority of software</i><br>
<i>&gt; available on the marketplace -- software designed for MS-Windows.</i><br>
<p>
Incorrect, as proven by the fact that such an operating system exists <br>
and is widely available in the US via multiple distributors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not only legal obstacles preventing any other company from muscling in, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; also technical roadblocks: MS have very intentionally made their OS large and</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex, and its inner workings occult, and subject to periodic change, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it's impractical for any competitor to attempt cloning it.  (They were</i><br>
<i>&gt; stung once by DR-DOS, so obviously Mr. Gates doesn't want that happening</i><br>
<i>&gt; again.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I make no secret of my antipathy toward Microsoft.</i><br>
<p>
Your antipathy, unfortunately, causes you to overstep reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  This company has</i><br>
<i>&gt; single-handedly set back the development of the computer industry 10 years or</i><br>
<i>&gt; more.</i><br>
<p>
I think IBM had a much larger hand in that.<br>
<p>
But then, IBM is officially not a monopoly.  Even the government <br>
admits it, after spending more than a decade and many millions of <br>
taxpayer dollars trying to prove that it it is.  And the government <br>
never had any successful action against IBM, so cannot claim any <br>
credit whatsoever for the fact that it is not a monopoly.<br>
