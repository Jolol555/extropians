<p>
My scenario is like this: in 1997 (?), a group of researchers become<br>
interested in creating a realistic model of C. Elegans, including data <br>
from cryosections, immunostaining, voltage-sensitive dyes, mutant data,<br>
morphogenesis, cytoskeleton simulators, soon to become available total <br>
sequence data, etc. They initiated the 'Cyberworm' project. Somewhen<br>
between now and 2030 they succeeded. Of course the Aplysia emulator<br>
crew gave them a head race ;)<br>

We have such proceses. The nematode is so small you can flash-vitrify<br>
it, and use e.g. progressive vacuum sublimation of water glass whilst<br>
imaging the surface with an AFM and/or immunolabeled-cell SNOM or<br>
plain transmission EM. A complementary etch could be UV laser<br>
photodissociation, or a very thin plasma/ion beam etch.<br>

<p>
Yes, after DSP filtering the voxelset you can apply contrast<br>
enhancement, outline tracing, segmentation, whatever. Neural and GA<br>
DSP should make this relatively easy.<br>
<p>
What really bugs me that we have a very good outline of the process<br>
already. The rest is just a lot of drudgery, and some serious money,<br>
and perhaps a few advances in the SPM/EM/Xray microcopy,<br>
high-performance computing areas, high-density memories, video DSP <br>
algorithms, etc. Don't get me wrong, immense work still has to be<br>
done, but it is not Science Fiction anymore while the mainstream still <br>
thinks it is.<br>
