<i>&gt; ..... run essay</i><br>
<i>&gt; contests with secondary school and college students as the target</i><br>
<i>&gt; audience. .... The Extropy Institute or other</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizations can get together a reading list and target high school</i><br>
<i>&gt; students.  This might leak into classroom discussion making the</i><br>
<i>&gt; influence of our ideas even more widespread -- aside from the bonus</i><br>
<i>&gt; of having them more seriously debate outside our circles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
This might work. My 15-year-old daughter just completed an assignment<br>
on "the ethics of technology." The class divided into groups and<br>
picked technologies. Her group picked nanotechnology. Apparently<br>
everybody had fun and learned a lot.<br>
<p>
She goes to an exceptional school, perhaps the best public high<br>
school in the country, but I suspect that a lot of kids would<br>
like to do this. Kirsten's school has a coordinated<br>
english/science/technology curriculum, in which the teachers of<br>
the separate courses coordinate their assignments and grading.<br>
Thus, the assignment was actually in the english class, but<br>
with help from the other two teachers.<br>
<p>
The typical teacher is fairly overworked, and may therefore be<br>
resistant to curriculum changes. Your essay idea avoids that<br>
by going directly to the student, but will therefore mostly<br>
reach the motivated student. An alternative is to try to<br>
catch the interest of the teacher. One way to do this might<br>
be to create a complete lesson plan suitable for use<br>
by the teacher to teach a one-class (45-minute) on an<br>
interesting future-oriented topic. You can orient toward the<br>
english class (readings, essay topics, debates) or toward the<br>
science class (nanotech fits nicely in chemistry or physics.)<br>
<p>
I've seen complete lesson plans for younger kids on different<br>
topics. The map-reading units at USGS are an example.<br>
