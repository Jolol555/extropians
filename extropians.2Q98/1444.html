From: den Otter &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;The point is: if you don't plan to make life enjoyable (whatever that may mean to</i><br>
<i>&gt;you) for yourself in the future, then what *do* you want?</i><br>
<p>
I enjoy life right now, so I don't need to plan to make it so. Too many people, I think, discard the<br>
present opportunity to enjoy life, by postponing happiness until some non-existant future. Of<br>
course, if you enjoy making plans, go for it. As I see it, extropy has its own way of amplifying<br>
human happiness to prompt the careful observer to embrace ever more complex adaptive systemsas they<br>
may spontaneously emerge. In this respect, extropy paralells the concept of the life force itself,<br>
as it evolves to higher levels of sentience.<br>
<p>
Rather than plan for future happiness, I've decided to expand my own present appreciation for the<br>
autonomous movement of extropian evolution. The extropian spike (Singularity) will, I extrapolate,<br>
involve features for which I have no way of adequately or appropriately planning. We cannot, IMO,<br>
make this thing happensince it involves incomprehensibly complex developmentsbut we *can* let it<br>
happen. The extent to which we enjoy this singular occurence depends on the degree to which we allow<br>
it to energize our consciousness.<br>
<p>
As extropy (of the non-denominational kind) explodes in the next decade or two, I anticipate a<br>
tremendous benefit to people who remain passively alert and attentive to the ultimate ramifications<br>
of a new form of sentience overtaking this planet, this solar system, this galaxy, etc.<br>
Nanotechnological engines of creation need engineers with the courage to say good-bye to their<br>
dreams of future planningto let themselves undergo the transformation necessary to continue into<br>
undreamed of potentialities. Such engineers will experience a psychological death. Until the old<br>
mind (brain) dies, the transformed mind (brain) cannot emerge. I think of the present humanity as a<br>
kind of "seed" that has to die (i.e., stop existing as a seed), so that it can sprout and grow. As<br>
one thing leads to another, the process of extropy creates a new consciousness totally disconnected<br>
from the old one. "Don't worry, be happy" sounds childish and naove to some folks, because they have<br>
given themselves to grim competition and an infowar position. But that attitude renders them<br>
short-lived and ill. I think an old astronomer summed it up in his epitath: "I cannot fear the<br>
night, for I have loved the stars." I feel a sense of awe and wonder ought to attach to our<br>
futurism, for no other reason than that we *enjoy* it.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
