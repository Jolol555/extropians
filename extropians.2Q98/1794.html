In a message dated 98-05-20 00:37:21 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; I'd be interested to hear (off-list if you prefer) if anyone else on<br>
this<br>
  list are home educating their children or know of anyone who is &gt;&gt;<br>
 our daughter is only 2 1/2 so it isn't yet a big issue...but i'd like too.<br>
my<br>
 wife is concerned about the lack of social developement supposedly associated<br>
 with home schooling... any thoughts or data on that, Grant?.. Cori<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
In addition to grant's post, you could also maybe put them in a summer camp or<br>
some funner kind of social group.  Those seem fun, just not the religious<br>
summer camps.  I think there are benefits from a good pre-school though, but<br>
into higher elementary and beyond home school seems a lot better.  I have good<br>
memories from Montessori school, but who knows what schools will be like in<br>
the near future, my old highschool just set up a graphic arts computer lab<br>
with a lot of high-end programs, it also has a video lab and a photography<br>
lab.  Chemistry labs and that kind of thing are ok too, so perhaps access to<br>
things is what we're looking for.<br>
