Neutrino finding could be key breakthrough in physics <br>

NEW YORK (June 5, 1998 11:56 a.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) - Scientists said<br>
Thursday they have evidence that tiny sub-atomic particles called neutrinos<br>
have mass, a finding that could be key to establishing the Grand Unification<br>
theory of physics. <br>
Physicists said that if the finding is confirmed by future experiments, it<br>
will<br>
cause a revision of the so-called Standard Model that describes<br>
interactions of<br>
elementary particle physics. In the Standard Model, neutrinos have no mass. <br>
"These new results could prove to be the key to finding the Holy Grail of<br>
physics, the unified theory," said John Learned, University of Hawaii<br>
Professor<br>
of Physics and Astronomy and one of the authors of a paper on a neutrinos<br>
experiment in Japan. <br>
"Neutrinos cannot now be neglected in the bookkeeping of the mass of the<br>
universe." <br>
The unified theory of physics, also called the Grand Unification, is what<br>
scientists would like to see: A combination of what is known as strong<br>
interaction, weak interaction and electromagnetism theory in a single<br>
framework. <br>
Grand Unification is a step removed however from the great quest of 20th<br>
century physics -- coming up with the so-called "theory of everything" in our<br>
universe that would also describe gravitational force. <br>
Known to physicists as the "Superstring theory" it would explain everything<br>
from what it was like in the milliseconds immediately after the Big Bang to<br>
what keeps people and objects rooted to Earth. <br>
The latest finding, to be presented in a paper Friday at a conference of<br>
physics and astrophysics in Takayama, Japan, caused excitement in the<br>
international physicist community. <br>
"It's a really incredibly exciting moment because of all of the particles we<br>
know neutrinos are among the most mysterious," said Professor Chang Kee<br>
Jung of<br>
SUNY StonyBrook in New York, one of the universities that took part in the<br>
experiment. <br>
He said neutrinos are tiny particles that float around without much<br>
interaction. About 500 billion neutrinos can pass by a person's fingertip<br>
every<br>
second. <br>
Neutrinos were discovered four decades ago and have been the subject of<br>
intense<br>
experimental and theoretical research. <br>
An experiment deep inside a Japanese mine has yielded results that are outside<br>
the Standard Model theory of elementary particle physics, which describes the<br>
fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. <br>
"So far the Standard Model works really well, we can explain just about<br>
everything we see but we know there has got to be something more out there,"<br>
said Dr. Evalyn Gates, a research scientist at the University of Chicago who<br>
was not involved in the project. <br>
"Knowing that neutrinos do have mass begins to direct some of these models. It<br>
would be the first definite evidence of new physics and that's why everyone is<br>
excited about this." <br>
The paper presented Friday in Japan has been sent to the Physical Review<br>
Letters, a physics journal. It describes results from the first two years of<br>
data collected from a $100 million experiment called Super-Kamiokande. <br>
The experiment uses a 12.5 million gallon stainless steel-lined tank of highly<br>
purified water located about 3,300 feet underground in a Japanese mine. Faint<br>
flashes of light given off by the neutrino interactions in the tank were<br>
observed by 13,000 lights. <br>
The collaboration involves the University of Tokyo's Institute for Cosmic Ray<br>
Research and includes six U.S. universities and eight from Japan. <br>
