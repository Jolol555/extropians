<i>&gt; &gt;spend a couple of months until the indians run out of funds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is untrue.  They may well run out of reserve capital, but so long as</i><br>
<i>&gt; their health and safety is in jeopardy, they will constantly be working to</i><br>
<i>&gt; preserve themselves; they can never be stripped of their human captial</i><br>
<i>&gt; unless killed.  At best, Bill Gates would keep on spending his money on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this FOREVER.</i><br>
<p>
If their human capital is worth almost nothing to the market (as it is, or<br>
otherwise their income would be higher), it is also worth nothing to their<br>
PPA.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, don't forget that most of his income comes from wise investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategies, not just from the software sales.  If he's spending a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; portion of his revenues on surpressing the populace, he will be severely</i><br>
<i>&gt; cutting into the growth of his income.  This decrease in growth would</i><br>
<i>&gt; cumulate over the years, eventually costing him far more than surpressing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the people ever would have been worth to him.  If he continues to persist</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway, you can be sure that his reserves would dwindle down to nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; over time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
not really, it just means that his growth wouldn't grow, but it does not<br>
mean that his growth would decline.  He could just keep a stable state and<br>
spend all his profits on his whims.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And best of all, Bill Gates, being a wise investor if nothing else, KNOWS</i><br>
<i>&gt; this, and therefore would NEVER try such a thing:  he'd much rather invest</i><br>
<i>&gt; in something that will actually pay for itself in the long run than throw</i><br>
<i>&gt; money at such a stupid plan.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
So, again we are trusting the powerful to be wise, just like in a<br>
dictatorship, monarchy, democracy, or any other form of centralised<br>
government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Second of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;all, even if someone did have to spend all his money (say a lesser god,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;like rupert murdoch or ted turner), that is still way too much power to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;give to one person.  Most of the psychotic dictators around the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;didn't get anywhere near that figure (arguably only three ever made it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there, counting side effects and other stuff)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps I should have made this clearer... if Gates *were* to spend all his</i><br>
<i>&gt; money, he'd be crushed by his competitors in no time flat.  And while Gates</i><br>
<i>&gt; is picking up the pieces of his squandered fortune, the indians will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; hiring a PPA to protect them from people like him in the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
the indians will not be hiring anyone cos they will be dead.  And as i<br>
showed before, Gates could do this with just using his profits.  (And if<br>
you don't like the numbers, change the 10000000 indians for 1 million<br>
indians, the actual number is inconsequential to the argument as long as<br>
that number reaches Shocking Proportions (tm))<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;That is if your PPA lets you decide where your money is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;going to go.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If it doesn't, YOU DISOBEY THEM, with the support of the other PPA, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; profits by helping you do so.  That's part of the point of this whole system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I addressed this in my previous answer to your mail. The profit to your<br>
current PPA is greater than the potential profit to the other PPA, etc...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I think the analogy with the nation state is pretty useful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you could fund another nation, (a la cubans in the US), but only if that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;other nation is more powerful than your current one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem with this analogy is that you're still thinking in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; nations, where you have to stage an overthrow (ie win a war) in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; live under a new form of government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the instance of PPAs, on the other hand, even tyrannical ones, we're</i><br>
<i>&gt; presuming that they're actually trying to do a cost-benefit analysis with</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect to what they're doing.  A tyrannical PPA will not simply throw</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself at all other PPAs indiscriminately if its customers decide to look</i><br>
<i>&gt; elsewhere.  That would be economic suicide.  It's simply not worth it to</i><br>
<i>&gt; pursue a "stay with us or suffer the consequences" policy when you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; competing with other PPAs, because war is expensive.  An agressive PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply can't compete with a peaceful non-interventionist one; the agressive</i><br>
<i>&gt; PPA would eventually go out of business, no matter HOW power-hungry they were.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I don't see this at all.  War is expensive for both sides.  Your PPA<br>
doesn't have to fight anyone if no other PPA tries to "rescue you".  And<br>
no other PPA will try because they know that your PPA gets a higher profit<br>
from you than they would (since that is the point of your rescue,<br>
otherwise they would try, and probably succeed, but this means that they<br>
would get more out of you than your current PPA).  Analogies with<br>
nation-states ad infinitum.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It comes down to this:  it's worth more to me not to be oppressed than it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is worth to others to oppress me.  No one can maintain for long a policy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; spending money on things which aren't worthwhile to them; such fools will</i><br>
<i>&gt; always go out of business in the long run, so long as other competitors</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist to take up the slack.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
read right above<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And that does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;guarantee that your new PPA won't do the same thing, even though it </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;might not be to the same degree (again, a la cubans in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the US).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, you don't have guarantees.  What guarantees do you have now of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same thing?  As John Clark pointed out, what's stopping the US armed forces</i><br>
<i>&gt; from turning this whole land into a military dictatorship?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Depends what you mean on "this whole land".  If you mean the US, i would<br>
say they get a very nice forced profit from you, and almost complete<br>
autonomy from any civil law.  this is probably more profitable for them<br>
than forcing a military dictatorship (they are tricky things to run, very<br>
personnel-intensive, and probably not worth the trouble).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree with Clark that anarcho-capitalism will not guarantee freedom,</i><br>
<i>&gt; (nothing will,) but rather that it is the political structure most likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; to uphold it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Depends on your idea of freedom.  I don't see it as something only<br>
quantitavely rather than qualitatively different from the current state.<br>
