At 19:38 5/4/98 -0400, you wrote:<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;The 'sunk cost' needs to be covered BEFORE I can realize profits on my</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;never recocver my R+D costs, why should I even think of creating something?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't understand what you mean when you say that your costs must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;recovered before you make a profit.  You cover costs BY making a profit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's the whole point.  :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
For me, profit = income - costs. Before I can get an income, I have to be<br>
able to present a product for sale. The costs of doing that must be covered<br>
by my income from sales before I see any profit. If I can't sell enough<br>
product to cover costs, I am bankrupt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Careful; in microeconomics we refer to two different entities which are</i><br>
<i>&gt;easily confused.  When we refer to "demand increasing" or "total demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;increasing," we mean that the whole demand curve has shifted upwards (as</i><br>
<i>&gt;takes place when you bring a new product to market).  However, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"quantity demanded" is a different beast altogether; the quantity demanded</i><br>
<i>&gt;will increase, for example, when supply increases (ie the supply curve</i><br>
<i>&gt;shifts down).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Okay. I admit it. I got lousy marks in econ. I am ignorant of some of the<br>
definitions, but I know when I am making money..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As far as "magical" increases in demand, I don't think it's at all</i><br>
<i>&gt;unreasonable to think that you'd get increased demand if you were offering</i><br>
<i>&gt;a new product, even if others were also offering the same product,</i><br>
<i>&gt;presuming that there is a profitable market for what you're selling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(DRAM, for example, may not be a profitable market at all.)  People see a</i><br>
<i>&gt;new thing, so some people who want the new thing and couldn't buy it before</i><br>
<i>&gt;will now start doing so.  What's so magical about that?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I believe the DRAM problem arose because someone forecast a much too rosy<br>
increase in demand, which never occurred.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The graphs that I showed you above were not the supply curve and demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;curve for the entire market, but only for your firm.  If you were to add up</i><br>
<i>&gt;the demand of all the buyers buying from you and your competitors, as well</i><br>
<i>&gt;as the supply costs for you and all of your competitors, you'd get a</i><br>
<i>&gt;microeconomic supply and demand graph for the market.  (They look</i><br>
<i>&gt;remarkably similar, perhaps I didn't make that clear.)  In that case,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're right, the increase in demand would have to be divided evenly among</i><br>
<i>&gt;the firms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I understand your point there, now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thus, in the end, if the revenues inside the trapezoid are greater than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;costs of invention, then you'll invent.  If not, it's not worth it, so you</i><br>
<i>&gt;won't.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Therein lies the rub - who can tell if the costs will be less than the<br>
revenuse. It's always a gamble. Sometimes you lose. C'est la vie..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, as for the monopoly analysis...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now, this isn't saying that VW starts with their price at some</i><br>
<i>&gt;extraordinarily high value at the beginning of every year and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;decreases the price with each car sold.  Obviously, if they were selling</i><br>
<i>&gt;cars where Q was the millions of cars sold and P was the price in thousands</i><br>
<i>&gt;of dollars, they will set one price ($7) and sell a certain quantity of</i><br>
<i>&gt;cars (3 millions).  However, if they want to sell 4 millions, VW must lower</i><br>
<i>&gt;the price.  [This is actually a bad example, because if you don't want a VW</i><br>
<i>&gt;you can always buy another car, whereas a monopolist would have cornered</i><br>
<i>&gt;the entire market for all cars.]</i><br>
<p>
The market will accept so many at a certain price, and if you want to sell<br>
more, you lower the price. Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When there's lots of competitors, however, you can't set your price that</i><br>
<i>&gt;way.  The market sets your prices in perfect competition, because if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;raise your prices at that quantity then nobody would buy from you;</i><br>
<i>&gt;meanwhile if you lower your price at that quantity you'll take a loss.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thus, your price is the same price as the entire market, and thus your</i><br>
<i>&gt;marginal revenue is given by the simple demand curve.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I begin to see where some of our disagreement may lie. I am talking about<br>
the real world, not theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not making this up...  You should be able to find this in any</i><br>
<i>&gt;microeconomics textbook.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
See above..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;There</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;are going to be second order effects - lags in development, tooling, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that will prevent the market from being fully satisfied at least in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;beginning of sales of a new invention. Some 'profit' will always be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;unreaped. This 'loss' is an imaginary quantity, since there is no way to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;EVER recover it, unless you posit 'thought to production' technology..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What do you mean by "satisfied?"  If for some reason you can't make enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;to "satisfy" demand, then you'll just sell fewer; the loss in sales is</i><br>
<i>&gt;deadweight loss for you and for your customers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Fully satified, in my mind, is there is no one left who wants the product at<br>
the moment, all have been served. Until this happens, there is still demand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once we observe that a monopolist makes more profit producing at a lower</i><br>
<i>&gt;quantity and a higher price than at a competitive price and at lower</i><br>
<i>&gt;quantity, we are able to restate it in another way:  a monopoly would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;to start taking a loss on every extra unit sold in order to reach the</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitive quantity, because in order to sell that much, the monopolist</i><br>
<i>&gt;has to lower its price to a competitive price (otherwise people won't buy</i><br>
<i>&gt;the competitive quantity!), further cutting into its profits.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To be blunt, you'd have to be MAD to produce like that.  It simply makes no</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense, once you've got monopoly status, to cut into your profits that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
In the absence of any controls, how do you prevent a monopoly, given<br>
somebody with the will to do it and no scruples?? A free market should be<br>
free of government handouts and special favors, but should also be free of<br>
coercion and use of force..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If the competitive price is arrived at by allowing anyone who happens along</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to steal my idea, I might as well stay out of the market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, that was what I was trying to say.  If you can't keep afloat at a</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitive price, then that's the market's way of saying "we don't want it</i><br>
<i>&gt;that badly."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Agreed. That I need to be 'competitive. I still don't agree that I should<br>
have to allow others to take my devlopment as is without compensating me.<br>
<p>
Look at it this way. I make ten widgets and put them on the market. I get<br>
people offering to buy them. Someone comes along and steals five, exerting<br>
some effort to convey them to his plant. I should allow him to keep and sell<br>
them, because he took the effort to transport the product? The same thing<br>
holds if I produce an idea, convert it to workable plans, and someone takes<br>
the plans and builds my gadget. I have been the victim of a theft either<br>
way. Ideas are the property of the thinker, until that person gives the<br>
rights away.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It's pretty hard to reap profits BEFORE you sell a product, unless there's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;some fairy godmother of a government agency that pays me for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;development, then lets anyone who cares to make the gadget! We have enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;handouts now!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, I think that inventors should sell their ideas, once, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclude the transaction.  Firms who try to negotiate a per-copy</i><br>
<i>&gt;arrangement will have greater marginal costs than firms who don't have this</i><br>
<i>&gt;arrangement, and thus won't be able to compete in a competitive market,</i><br>
<i>&gt;whereas a firm which pays a sunk cost can recover that cost from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;increase in demand.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
All we need is someone who will put up the money to the inventor for the<br>
rights to the product, knowing that as soon as he produces the thing, twenty<br>
knockoff plants will be making the identical thing, and at less cost, since<br>
this poor fellow had to pay the inventor. The theft is now one person<br>
removed from the inventor, and he does not suffer directly. Since there is<br>
no property rights in an idea, the first plant owner can't recover from the<br>
copyists..<br>
