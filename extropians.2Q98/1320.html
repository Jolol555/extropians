This seems a really dumb proposal.  The problem of someone along the chain <br>
selling it to more than two others seems *worse* than the problem of <br>
someone who isn't supposed to sell it at all selling it.  And since <br>
competition must make the book free at the end of the chain, only people<br>
who are in a terrible rush to read it before it gets to the end would pay <br>
any price for it before.  <br>
<p>
And with multiple owners out there they'd all compete to get copies out<br>
fast enough to serve those rushed customers.  Within a day the book price<br>
is free, so unless there are lots of people who really really want to read <br>
it the first hour its out, the initial market value should be near zero<br>
as well. <br>
