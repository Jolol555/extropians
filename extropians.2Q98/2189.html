[Technical data comms stuff in the middle. Extropian conclusions<br>
at the end.]<br>
<p>
This announcement is really hard to evaluate. As far as I can tell<br>
after carefully reading their extensive press release, <br>
   <a href="http://www.sprint.com">http://www.sprint.com</a><br>
they are announcing an amalgamation of several different technologies.<br>
I can't tell for sure, but it looks like a "spraypaint integration"<br>
(i.e., don't really change anything in several separate products,<br>
just repaint then all the same color.) The internal hi-speed Sprint<br>
network will apparently be IP over ATM and voice over ATM. The<br>
high-speed lines to big busnesses will apparantly be ATM over SONET,<br>
with IP over the ATM and voice over ATM(?) The high-speed local loops<br>
for small business and consumers will apparently be xDSL, which is<br>
currently specified to use ATM. The local loops are an interesting story.<br>
They run on copper wire that belong to the local phone company, but<br>
recent regulations require the phone company to permit competitors to<br>
install gear at the telco central offices to interface the local loops.<br>
A few small companies have succeeded in getting past the telcos' delaying<br>
tactics and actually installing gear, but Sprint is likely to get tied<br>
up forever in arcane disputes, so don't expect to see it in your house<br>
any time soon. Among other things, many new local loops don't go all the<br>
way from your house to the central office, but instead terminate in a<br>
pylon in your neighborhood, with the voice converted to PCM on a fiber.<br>
Thus, a competitor's switch in the CO cannot connect directly to your local<br>
loop anyway.<br>
<p>
OK then, what's the REAL meaning of this announcement? I think the real<br>
meaning is that Sprint has invested heavily in ATM and is now panicing<br>
because ATM may become obsolete before it really gets used much. In<br>
particular, AT&amp;T recently announced that their vision of the future is<br>
to run naitve IP directly on the fiber, removing the SONET and ATM layers.<br>
voice will then run over IP. This is a data net with a voice overlay,<br>
instead of the current voice-oriented (i.e., TDM, constant bit rate) net<br>
with a data overlay.) One piece of evidence that Sprint paniced is that<br>
their entire multi-page announcement never once mentions ATM.<br>
<p>
What does all this mean? Well, it means that the future is arriving<br>
at a rate that large companies have trouble dealing with. The distributed<br>
IP protocol, with its distributed quasi-informal standards organization,<br>
has triumphed over the more centralized, top-down standards promulgations<br>
of the ITU and even over the industry-driven ATM forum. Furthermore, the<br>
fundamental driving assumption of ATM (that IP-style switching is too<br>
CPU-intensive to compete.) has been decisively refuted, even though the<br>
analysis was forward-looking and relatively recent. It also means that<br>
we may have to add AT&amp;T and cisco to the short list of companies (Microsoft,<br>
Intel) that utterly dominate a major high-tech area.<br>
