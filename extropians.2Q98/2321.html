THEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING EXAM 1 5 Questions, 60 Minutes.<br>
<p>
You may use a calculator, the Bible, the Koran, the Torah, and the <br>
Book of Mormon. The speed of light is c. Show all work. For all <br>
problems, assume a perfectly spherical Jesus of constant density D. No <br>
praying during the exam.<br>
<p>
1. (20 pts.) Bob and Joe are standing on a street corner. God loves <br>
each an equal amount L_0. Bob then accelerates to .9c. In Joe's rest <br>
frame, how much does God now love Bob?<br>
<p>
2. Sven, a Catholic, is in a state of grace. He then has sex with <br>
sheep S. a. (8 pts.) What is Sven's atonement coefficient following <br>
the act if the sheep was not willing? b. (12 pts.) What if the sheep, <br>
while not technically being willing, could not be said to mind either?<br>
<p>
3. (20 pts.) Let the eternal, all abiding love of the Holy Spirit be <br>
the xy plane. Let Sue's soul be at (0,0,5) at t = 0 sec., traveling at <br>
5 m/s in the direction of the positive z axis. Everything is in <br>
Cartesian coor- -dinates bespeaking subscription to a perfectly <br>
rational Enlightenment attitude towards the Universe. At what time t <br>
will Sue be saved? (Hint: Assume a point soul.)<br>
<p>
4. (20 pts.) Assume the Rapture occurs at time t. Cornelia, a saved <br>
human weighing 90 kg, in a state of grace, has her head in the closing <br>
jaws of an alligator at time t. What mass of meat will remain to the <br>
alligator at time t + 10 sec.?<br>
<p>
5. Stan is a frictionless, massless Mormon in a rest state. His sin <br>
level for his faith is currently 11 McBeals. He eats .3 kg of pork, <br>
and enjoys it very much. Assume that the Jews are right about, well, <br>
pretty much everything. a. (10 pts.) What is Stan's sin level now?<br>
 <br>
b. (10 pts.) Stan is one of them Salt Lake City Mormons. He ain't so <br>
damn smug now, is he?<br>
<p>
Extra Credit (10 pts): 25 grams of wafers and 20 ml of cheap wine <br>
undergo transubstantiation and become the flesh and blood of our <br>
Lord. How many Joules of heat are released by the transformation?<br>
Hand in exam when done, and may God have mercy on your work.<br>
