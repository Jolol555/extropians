DF&gt; In contrast to Marx's "labor theory of value," I think modern economics is<br>
DF&gt; a kind of a "capital theory of value," which presumes that all wealth in<br>
DF&gt; some way, shape, or form, stems from capital.<br>
<p>
Wealth stems from *any* economic resource that is used to produce goods and<br>
services.  Labor has always been the most important of those.  (Although land<br>
is very important in agricultural societies, such as under feudalism.)<br>
However, automation allows us to substitute capital for labor.  This is<br>
exactly what happens whenever a company replaces workers with machines.  It<br>
also happens when machines allow a given number of workers to produce more,<br>
instead of having to hire more workers.<br>
<p>
DF&gt; In this sense, we understand the work done by a laborer as comparable to<br>
DF&gt; the wealth created by a capitalist.  The only difference is this:  where<br>
DF&gt; the capitalist uses material capital to create wealth, the laborer creates<br>
DF&gt; wealth using their "human capital."  Wages can be thought of as the price<br>
DF&gt; of human capital.<br>
<p>
OK.  But that seems to me like a terribly abstract and stilted way of saying<br>
it.  It's more straightforward to say that labor and capital can be partly<br>
substituted for one another.  This has always been true to some extent, but<br>
automation technology allows *more* capital to displace labor.  Eventually it<br>
could allow all labor to be displaced by capital.<br>
<p>
DF&gt; Why is this relevant?  Because this means that it is wrong headed to say<br>
DF&gt; that "work" must always be done.  Wealth must be exchanged for wealth, but<br>
DF&gt; wealth comes from CAPITAL, not work.  And human-owned capital may one day<br>
DF&gt; be just as effective at creating wealth as human capital is today.<br>
<p>
This is where AI robots come into the picture.  If we assume a robot is owned<br>
by someone and is therefore a form of capital, and if we also assume that the<br>
robot can perform tasks which a human worker could do (i.e producing "wealth"<br>
in the form of goods and services), then this is the mechanism by which wealth<br>
can come from capital instead of from labor.<br>
<p>
DF&gt; In the long run, however, the solution to this problem is cheap privately<br>
DF&gt; owned capital, with as high a rate of return as possible.  The perfect<br>
DF&gt; extreme example of this would the "anything box:" the anything box can<br>
DF&gt; create anything, including another anything box, for free.  This is<br>
DF&gt; obviously unrealistic,<br>
<p>
Maybe not entirely unrealistic, in the long run.  I envisioned an "anything<br>
box" that was more like a bush robot, able to wander around and help people in<br>
whatever way it sees fit.  It could be sort of semi-sentient, semi-autonomous<br>
creature: a robotic slave that belongs to the general public rather than to<br>
any private individual.  It's an idea that I find both attractive and<br>
suspicious, because it seems too utopian.  Too good to be true?<br>
<p>
DF&gt; HOWEVER, I still maintain that having lots of sentient robots around would<br>
DF&gt; be good for us too.  We don't have to make an either-or decision here.  We<br>
DF&gt; can use BOTH, reaping the benefits of automation AND the benefits of a<br>
DF&gt; larger population all in one fell swoop.<br>
<p>
I'm still not clear on exactly what are the benefits of a larger population.<br>
I'm working from a standpoint of fear, because people tend to *want* to<br>
reproduce.  It is something they innately desire, for Darwinian reasons.<br>
Those who don't want to reproduce get weeded out of the gene pool.  I must<br>
admit that even I find the idea of creating new life rather appealing.  It's<br>
something I would enjoy doing.  And I also note that an exponentially growing<br>
population will eventually outstrip any and all resources that you can throw<br>
at it.  It doesn't matter exactly what the limiting factor turns out to be,<br>
because a growing population will eventually *find* that limit.  It's hard to<br>
see a happy end to that.<br>
<p>
Realistically, I probably shouldn't be worried about this.  We may be<br>
thousands of years away from running into those limits.  Still, why tempt<br>
fate by building population growth into your economic system?<br>
