Stop right there, if you're outside the event horizon then you can't see  <br>
anything inside it.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
If I was far away and watching you I would see you and your watch slow down <br>
as you approached the event horizon, and when you reached it you and your  <br>
watch would stop completely. From your own point of view you'd see nothing <br>
special when you crossed the event horizon, it just marks the point of no <br>
return for you. Well ok, you might notice the tidal forces trying to crush <br>
you, but if the black hole was millions of times as massive as the sun they <br>
wouldn't be large enough to be lethal even at the event horizon, and wouldn't <br>
be until you got a lot closer to the central singularity. And once you <br>
crossed the event horizon there is no way to stop from getting closer to the<br>
center.         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If light is travelling lengthwise between two incredibly long,         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;density of space, would not the speed of light increase over that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;outside  of this system?  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Interesting example, although the plates wouldn't have to be incredibly long <br>
or dense. If you place two flat mirrors very close together then there can <br>
not be virtual photons of every wavelength in the vacuum between the mirrors,  <br>
as there is outside, because some will interfere destructively. There are<br>
more virtual particles in the vacuum outside the mirrors pushing them <br>
together than between the  mirrors pushing them apart. This force is <br>
extremely weak, but recently it has actually been measured in the lab. <br>
2 mirrors really do want to come together. <br>
<p>
If you define a vacuum far from any object as having zero pressure and if the <br>
vacuum can still push the plates together then the space between the plates <br>
must have negative pressure. According to Einstein, mass is not the only <br>
thing that can warp space and time, that is, create gravity, pressure can too,<br>
although this only becomes important when the pressure is VERY high, like  <br>
inside a Neutron star. New theory says negative pressure should do <br>
interesting things to time and space also, just like positive pressure, but <br>
this part has not been confirmed experimentally because the effect is so tiny. <br>
<p>
An observer's clock between the plates will (probably) run a little fast and <br>
for an observer outside the plates distances would (probably) expand a little. <br>
Since speed is distance divided by time nobody sees a change in the speed of <br>
light. This negative pressure idea is a little similar to the old cosmological<br>
constant idea of Einstein, he later said that was the worst mistake of his <br>
life, but maybe not, it may play an important part in the  evolution of the <br>
universe.       <br>

<i>        &gt;scientific literature over the past oh, three or four years         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The question was not whether the Big Bang is true or not but weather it's a <br>
scientific theory or not, you said it was not but the only reason given is <br>
that you just don't like it. If you have other reasons I'd like to hear them.<br>
                <br>

<i>        &gt;Even at background radiation levels, black holes are slowly melting         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;at the event horizon</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
According to Hawking a black hole left to itself would slowly melt away. In  <br>
the vacuum virtual particles and antiparticles are constantly being created  <br>
but they collide after a very short time and are destroyed. Things are  <br>
different near a black hole, tidal effects at the event horizon would <br>
sometimes be strong enough to pull these virtual particles apart, one could<br>
fall into the black hole leaving the other one free to become a real particle <br>
and radiate away into the outside world.  Thus Black holes are not really <br>
black, they give off radiation just like any object above absolute zero. <br>
The smaller the black hole the larger the tidal  effect at the event horizon, <br>
so there is an inverse relationship between the  mass of a black hole and<br>
its temperature. Large black holes are very cold, small ones are hot, at the <br>
last moments of their life they are so small and so hot, many trillions of <br>
degrees, that they explode.<br>
<p>
A black hole of 2 solar masses is pretty cold, it radiates energy at  <br>
3 * 10^-8 degrees Kelvin, that energy comes at the expense of the black hole's <br>
mass but would take 10^67 years to evaporate. Actually it would take even <br>
longer, the cosmic background radiation is at 2.7 degrees so such black holes <br>
are actually getting larger and will keep doing so unless the universe cools <br>
to 3 * 10^-8 degrees or less. If that ever happens it will take a long time.<br>
