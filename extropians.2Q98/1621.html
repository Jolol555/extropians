Funny, that.<br>

This list, much to its credit methinks, is rife with critical thinkers<br>
of the skeptical variety. Yet, I can't help but cast quizzical looks at<br>
<a href="http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/btcarrol/skeptic/future.html">http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/btcarrol/skeptic/future.html</a> where it<br>
appears ExI is slated for debunking by the esteemed skeptic Dr. Robert<br>
Carroll.<br>
<p>
It is worthy for one to be skeptical. Yes, indeed. But it may be equally<br>
worthy for one to be skeptical of the skeptical.<br>
<p>
Cognitive dissonance, anyone? :)  <br>

<p>
Sacred cows are to blame. I find I have a much more open-mind to such<br>
Damnable Heresies as Singularity, and Little Machines That Can Do<br>
Everything And More. Things future and visionary make me all giggly. Is<br>
this a symptom of 'a mind so open that the brains fell out?' Certainly<br>
not. Or perhaps not certainly not.<br>
<p>
/BEGIN ANECDOTE <br>
<p>
My very religious mother and I were having a brief conversation the<br>
other day by way of voice (ugh) communication. We were talking about the<br>
normal mother/son things (Powers, Dyson Spheres, Great Filters, etc. :)<br>
when the thought crossed my mind that if I were to try to explain<br>
nanotech to her, she might snicker like a skeptic in the best case, or<br>
tag me a 'buffoon' for the rest of my life in the worst case. <br>
<p>
She might be right.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the point is that she has no trouble believing that a wiseman<br>
named Christ went fussing about turning water into wine and raising<br>
folks from the dead (including himself). Furthermore, she has no trouble<br>
believing that after having been killed once, HE'S COMING BACK FOR MORE! <br>
<p>
END ANECDOTE/<br>
<p>
So, the moral of this story is that the more sacred your sacred cows,<br>
the easier it is to swallow the really big pills that relate to those<br>
cows (or at least make it more exciting to believe them).<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  (I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of those people who find it hard to believe anyone except the mentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; infirm would choose  to wear a baseball hat backwards - it mimics baldness,</i><br>
<i>&gt; never a good look, it leaves you with the sun in your eyes, not a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fun, and it's a marker of herd mentality.)</i><br>
<p>
If you don't mind, Damien, I'm going to file this one away for future<br>
reference. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suspect this might have something to do with anxiety control.   If your</i><br>
<i>&gt; stress set-points are low, from birth, you might arrange your reactions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world in a defensive, suspicious way, and if you're intelligent as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well, you might do this by constructing/adopting highly complex, organised</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems of categorisation, evaluation and expression.  More relaxed people</i><br>
<i>&gt; might find it easier to break free, to explore `imaginatively' without the</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk of premature closure.  (If that's true, there'll also be more paranoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; delusives - who might seem at first sight to be wildly imaginative - among</i><br>
<i>&gt; the non-`imaginatives' as well... which is one of the claims in the spoof</i><br>
<i>&gt; article.)</i><br>
<p>
Neat idea. Some people are convinced that the chasm between neophobe and<br>
neophile is traversible using drugs of some sort. We've had this<br>
discussion here before, and I don't know if it was ever settled. Maybe<br>
Danny remembers? <br>
<p>
Inventiveness seems to have been a survival trait. Imagination? I don't<br>
know. Are they different? The starry-eyed daydreamer would have died off<br>
pretty quickly, it seems, what with the large predators running about<br>
the savanna 25,000 years ago. OTOH, imagination seems to follow<br>
intelligence around. Just look at the canonical interpretations of QT.<br>
Or Kip Thorne and exotic matter. Who has more imagination than that? <br>
<p>
Imagination seems to require the ability to take some unproven things<br>
for granted and extrapolate from there. And is it worth mentioning that<br>
this sounds awfully a lot like theoretical applied science? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you a later-born, Anders?  Max?  Natasha?  Greg?  Keith?  John?  Anyone?</i><br>
<p>
Nope. I'm also an exception to the apparent rule. I'm a first-born,<br>
low-stress guy, who doesn't mind reading the Psychoceramics list (and<br>
who doesn't mind asking what *if* Monica Lewinsky and Elvis were on the<br>
Trilateral Commission...). <br>
