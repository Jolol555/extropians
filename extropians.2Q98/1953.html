As Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin just put it, "our ability<br>
to perceive and measure the truth is fuzzy". And, I<br>
believe this is always so except for tautologies and<br>
axiomatic truths such as "I think therefore I am" and<br>
"there are other minds" and "there really is a world<br>
of objects out there that I can bump into". <br>
Stringing these together, we might even come up with<br>
the 'Absolute Truth' that "I think there are other<br>
minds out there that I had better be careful about<br>
bumping into". <br>
<p>
If you pressed them, I doubt that even the most<br>
relativistic radical would argue with these 'truths'.<br>
 So, everyone has an ontological sense of truth, even<br>
if they don't always admit it.  The part that people<br>
argue about is when it comes to epistemology and that<br>
particular slice of Reality they happen to be focused<br>
on (the sky is blue, you say, well, define sky...)<br>
<p>
What I really wanted to mention, though, was that<br>
there's currently a discussion on another list that<br>
is mentioning some of the same topics that have come<br>
up here, in a slightly different context; namely,<br>
F.Hayek's theory of mind and liberty.<br>
<p>
In particular, Erik Davis (whose "thesis has proposed<br>
a Hayek-Jung synthesis"), mentions Chris Sciabarra's<br>
_Marx, Hayek and Utopia_ and claims that "'bootstrap'<br>
theories of mental processes--which Hayek often<br>
associates with vulgar Marxism and which tend to<br>
antagonize or neglect the tacit dimension--go hand in<br>
hand with totalitarian-utopian political theories".<br>
(See<br>
<a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9805">http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9805</a>&amp;L=hayek-l&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=13082).<br>
 Davis adds:<br>
<p>
"For example, Marxists of various sorts have tended<br>
to see unintended/unconscious (and therefore tacit)<br>
social-systemic processes as something to be<br>
overcome--something unfavorable.  This is why in the<br>
New Left one finds a synthesis of Marxism and<br>
Freudianism, because Freudians also saw the<br>
unconscious (and its tacit dimension) as  something<br>
to be overcome--something unfavorable."<br>
<p>
Michael Polanyi explained how tacit knowledge was<br>
essential to personal knowledge.  Hayek explained how<br>
this kind of "fuzzy truth" was also essential to the<br>
functioning of a free society.  As Hayek puts it in<br>
"The Use of Knowledge in Society":<br>
(see<br>
<a href="http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Economics/HayekUseOfKnowledge.html">http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Economics/HayekUseOfKnowledge.html</a>)<br>
<p>
"The peculiar character of the problem of a rational<br>
economic order is determined precisely by the fact<br>
that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we<br>
must make use never exists in concentrated or<br>
integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of<br>
incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge<br>
which all the separate individuals possess...<br>
<p>
"Today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific<br>
knowledge is not the sum of all knowledge. But a<br>
little reflection will show that there is beyond<br>
question a body of very important but unorganized<br>
knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific<br>
in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the<br>
knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and<br>
place."<br>
<p>
This is why the notion of Absolute Truth seems<br>
dogmatic and counter-productive to me.<br>
