My view is similar. I think most people are pretty smart, when they WANT to<br>
be. Unfortunately, too many people are willing to idle their way through<br>
life and let others make thier decisions for them. The present state of the<br>
US Government is ample evidence of this.<br>
<p>
In the case of extreme circumstances, many of the idlers will wake up and<br>
show their true capabilities. Unfortunately for them, probably fortunately<br>
for us, such situations are few and far between.<br>
