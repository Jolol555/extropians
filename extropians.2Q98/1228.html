   IAN: And should be able to distinguish between <br>
   numbers and the realities they connote, such<br>
   a 5 and 5 things, and between 0 &amp; no thing.<br>
   That's where my interest in Base 1 comes<br>
   into play, since B1 maps the reality <br>
   behind numbers by 100%, such that <br>
   11111 is both 5 and 5 things.<br>
<p>
   To teach a computer to interface with the <br>
   real world, it seems to me that we have to <br>
   establish a logical interface between B1 <br>
   and the higher-order-number bases its<br>
   programs are built upon. The example <br>
   I posted doesn't accomplish that. :(<br>
<p>
   It's probably easy enough to have a set <br>
   of rules that say 11111(B1) = 101(B2).<br>

<p>
  IAN: The square root of -l is the imaginary number i.<br>
  From what I understand, irrational numbers are real <br>
  numbers that cannot be expressed as integers or as <br>
  the quotient of two integers,  such as the square <br>
  root of 2 or pi. But I may be missing your point.<br>
