Subject: Pre-Freezing Protocol<br>
<p>
Hi:<br>
<p>
In the latest edition of "New Scientist" there was an article about a new<br>
protocol being used to prepare pig embryos for reversable freezing.  It<br>
seems from the article that the cells in a pig embryo are more<br>
(differentiated) than those in most other animals and freezing usually<br>
irreversibly damages them. The villians were apparently the microfilaments<br>
that help cells to keep their shape.<br>
<p>
The solution was to perfuse the cells with cytochalasin, which broke down<br>
the microfilaments into simpler structures which weren't damaged on<br>
freezing.  On thawing, the cells are able to rebuild these simpler<br>
structures into the correct microfilaments once more.<br>
<p>
Is anyone using a similar protocol in their experiments with freezing and<br>
thawing fully differentiated organisms?<br>
<p>
Sincerely<br>
Robert Horley<br>
