<i>&gt; What I can say is this:  animals cannot and do not respect law, contract or</i><br>
<i>&gt; the utility of other animals.  Some animals do respect the land of others</i><br>
<i>&gt; or engage in "altruistic" behavior with respect to other animals, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; others are carnivorous, aggressive and/or selfish to the point of killing</i><br>
<i>&gt; others to achieve their ends.  We would not accept such behavior if it were</i><br>
<i>&gt; a human doing so to others.</i><br>
<p>
Animals do not kill meaninglessly and aggressively. Within an animal<br>
society, even dyads and trios, indivduals must conform to a social code<br>
which obviously, however, differs from our social code. If you are saying<br>
that we can not "contract" animals into conforming into our social code<br>
you are right but it is silly to even suggest that. Actually, I think it<br>
is outright wrong in the egocentric human sense to think that everyone and<br>
thing should conform to self. Furthermore, animals only kill others for<br>
food or defense. There are two and only two species that kill others of<br>
the same kind in a ruthless manner. Ironically, they are very related<br>
species, chimpanzees and humans (See Richard Wrangham's Demonic Males)<br>
