<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt; The first genetic marker has been found for a gene that has a weak </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;but statistically real effect on IQ. </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;This isn't as exciting as it sounds, unfortunately. The gene codes </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;for an immune protein, </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You must be thinking of something else, this was just reported and as far as </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know nobody knows what the gene codes for, in fact nobody has even found </i><br>
<i>&gt; the gene, Plomin found a marker that must be near the gene, the marker itself </i><br>
<i>&gt; is just a bit of nonfunctional junk DNA</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, I thought I had some references handy here, since I attended a<br>
seminar on this subject at Stockholm University a coupe of weeks<br>
back. I seem to have misplaced my notes somewhere, but I recall that<br>
the study they reviewed involved immune-linked genes. I'll get back on<br>
this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;if you have a strong immune system, you have more time  and energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;in school (or elsewhere) where your brain will be trained.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you're talking about children who do poorly in school maybe, although </i><br>
<i>&gt; history is full of sickly geniuses, in this case however we're talking about </i><br>
<i>&gt; children who's IQ range from a normal 100 to an unusual 160 and above. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see how lack of sickness can explain that, I think they're on to </i><br>
<i>&gt; something.</i><br>
<p>
If you have a good health (or just the right kind of health that<br>
leaves your brain functional even if your body is sick), the brain<br>
might get more nutrients and be able to develop better. But there<br>
might be other factors too, a wild hypothesis might be that some of<br>
these genes create very useful wiring structures that others lack or<br>
have to build by experience.<br>
