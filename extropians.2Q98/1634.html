<p>
   What i really want is these three commands:<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
i_ate FOOD [TIME]<br>
<p>
   This tells the system that i ate FOOD at TIME.  The information is <br>
entered into a diet tracker and stored on disk.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   <br>
nutrient_status [PERIOD]<br>
<p>
   Consults the diet tracker and tells me what percentage of the <br>
recommended nutrient intake i've had in the past PERIOD.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
what_should_i_eat [PERIOD]<br>
<p>
   Consults the diet tracker and suggests some foods that i could eat to <br>
bring my nutrient intake up to 100% of the recommended, when averaged <br>
over the past PERIOD.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   The idea is that i try to keep track of what i eat and enter the data <br>
into the diet log whenever convenient, using i_ate.  At will i can query <br>
the system, using nutrient_status, to see how my diet matches some <br>
preset target (such as that suggested by the CR/AN diet).  If i'm not <br>
meeting my target i can use what_should_i_eat to suggest a food or foods <br>
to bring me up to the target.<br>
<p>
<p>
   The difficult part would be correctly entering your foods eaten into <br>
the diet tracker.  When cooking at home it's relatively easy, but when <br>
you eat food that others have prepared it's often difficult to assess <br>
the ingredients and their nutrient content.<br>
<p>
<p>
   Other than that it's a simple database application.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   (Preemptive flame retardant:  I understand that the diet plan of the <br>
Caloric Restriction method is intended to be used in conjunction with an <br>
exercise program, and that the system described above does nothing to <br>
help you with the exercise regimen.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   Bodies are machines.  Food is fuel and spare parts.  This is an <br>
attempt at rational food management.<br>
