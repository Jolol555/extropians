<p>
As an unrelated quote...  It IS the United States Government, yes?  Not the<br>
"so-called" USG?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What *practical* freedoms do you want that you do</i><br>

<p>
I'd like to be able to do whatever I want with my own body.  (The FDA and<br>
the religious right disagree with me.)  I'd like to be able to speak<br>
freely; even if I'm on television.  I don't want to fight/die for the<br>
voting majority, even if the voting majority decides it would be a good<br>
idea to draft me.  I want to buy what I want, and only what I want, from<br>
whomever I choose.  (Right now I am forced to pay for whatever the<br>
government does; I want to stop paying for it if I don't want it.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What prevents you from achieving what you want?</i><br>
<p>
A voting majority, sadly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What prevents </i><br>
<i>&gt;you from puttinging in place the practical means to achieve the above?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I could try to convince the whole electorate to change their minds<br>
about all of these things and more; I do try to convince as many as<br>
possible.  It isn't working, at least for now.  And I will never be able to<br>
get everyone to agree with me.<br>
<p>
So, in light of that, I'd like to go secede by myself, and not bother<br>
anyone with my weird ideas about liberty/justice.<br>
