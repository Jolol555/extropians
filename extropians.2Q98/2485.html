Relative to what?  Not A or B.<br>

<p>
It certainly does not.  I'm saying that A is decreasing relative to B and<br>
that B is decreasing relative to A.  There is no "true" length without a<br>
reference frame.  However, I am also saying that because both are<br>
decreasing relative to each other (rather than one increaseing and one<br>
decreasing as we would expect), they are also not increasing in size<br>
relative to anything: A remains unchanged to itself and shrinks with<br>
respect to B; B remains unchanged to itself and shrinks with respect to A.<br>
There is not point where A increases relative to B, and THAT'S the truth.<br>

<p>
No, you don't understand.  You're thinking in terms of Newtonian physics<br>
and not in the inherently non-intuitive terms of special relativity. <br>
Normally, when something gets smaller, something else gets larger relative<br>
to it; special relativity sys that when B appears smaller to A, A appears<br>
SMALLER to B, not larger.  This is why it doesn't sum to 0:  If B were<br>
actually shrinking, it would look like this: <br>
<p>
   A  B<br>
A  0 -C<br>
B +C  0<br>
<p>
and zero mechanics would be saved.  This is, however, NOT the situation<br>
described above, at all.  A is *NOT* growing relative to B, it is<br>
SHRINKING relative to B.  That's why we get:<br>
<p>
   A  B<br>
A  0 -C<br>
B -C  0<br>
<p>
which is distinctly different from the case in which B actually shrinks<br>
relative to A.<br>
<p>
The reason why this matrix is wrong:<br>
<p>
   A  B<br>
A  0 +C<br>
B +C  0<br>
<p>
is because it says something that simply isn't true:  A does not increase<br>
in size relative to B.  You can't use this matrix without claiming that A<br>
increases in size relative to B and that A increases in size relative to<br>
B; this never actually happens.  It SHOULD, according to Newtonian<br>
mechanics, but it doesn't.<br>
