The worst thing, a fair fraction of them are still not getting it --<br>
there is a significant (and growing) support for the communist party.<br>
The things have not improved as rapidly as promised/people would like<br>
to have it, and they are getting impatient. Also, most of them are<br>
depressed and cynical, many are looking to make an escape into the<br>
west. Men being alcoholics is axiomatic. Health care system is down,<br>
pensions often hardly sufficient to keep people alive. Otoh,<br>
especially among older people a touchingly naive faith in <br>
the government is widespread I don't know what the average youth is<br>
thinking, but girls are purported to find prostitution an attractive <br>
career. Unemployment, especially hidden unemployment are<br>
dramatic. Black economy eclipses the official budget by an order of magnitude.<br>
Ecological situation is a desaster. Bad as the situation in Moscow and <br>
Leningrad is, the periphery is way worse. Wages are not paid for<br>
months there. People are gone into minifarming to not to<br>
starve. Sachalin's fisher fleet won't function because there is not<br>
enough money for fuel. Youth criminality is very high <br>
generally, the streets are not safe at night. Infrastructure is in <br>
a terrible state, attempts of  maintanance are slovenly. The streets <br>
belong to the dirt, and the street dogs. Kamikaze car drivers with<br>
bogus licenses run over people frequently. The new russians often even <br>
do not stop after an accident -- they can always get away by bribes.<br>
Tendency for improvement is purported to be there, yet it is slow<br>
enough not be perceptable by yours truly on the scale of a few months.<br>
<p>
The centralism has not decreased imo: merely people in leading<br>
positions grabbed the resources which suddenly become available. Of<br>
course, to be in leading positions these people had to be Communists.<br>
The tax system is a bad joke. Mid-range businessmen are drained both<br>
by the mafia and ridiculous taxation. There is money out there, but it is<br>
concentrated enormously. The newest of the new russians have current <br>
or past criminal affiliations. The most basic issues as<br>
e.g. privatization of the ground are still being debated about, after<br>
a decade of 'reforms'.  For all practical purposes industry is down. <br>
As is science (20% of MSU's staff have leaved the country, most of<br>
them permanently. Of course these are the best 20%). The mafia and <br>
the government are indistinguishable. The police is corrupt, and <br>
harasses and waylays people (you can be easily beaten up and robbed, <br>
legal methods to combat this are useless -- in fact worse than<br>
useless -- police casualties are thus very high). Mafia and business <br>
are indistinguishable. During 'rasborki', as they call it, mafia gang <br>
members and businessmen are killed routinely.<br>
<p>
There's centralism for you.<br>

ciao,<br>
