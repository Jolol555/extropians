Title<br>
  Effects of green tea, black tea and dietary lipophilic antioxidants on LDL<br>
  oxidizability and atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolaemic<br>
  rabbits.<br>
Source<br>
  Atherosclerosis.  135(1):37-47, 1997 Nov.<br>
Abstract<br>
  The hypothesis that tea or dietary lipid-soluble antioxidants reduce<br>
  atherogenesis by lowering the oxidizability of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)<br>
  was investigated. Five groups of 20 female New Zealand white rabbits were fed<br>
  a restricted amount of a high-fat (30 en%) semipurified diet supplemented<br>
  with cholesterol (0.15%, w/w) for 21 weeks. The vitamin E content of the<br>
  control diet was 40 mg/kg diet. The animals received either green tea or<br>
  black tea in their drinking water or vitamin E (200 mg/kg diet) or<br>
  beta-carotene (20 mg/kg). The serum cholesterol concentrations (in the order<br>
  of 18-23 mmol/l) were not significantly different between the groups. Vitamin<br>
  E was substantially increased as compared to controls in vitamin E<br>
  supplemented animals (3-fold within 8 weeks in plasma and LDL; P &lt; 0.01) and<br>
  weakly (1.2-fold) by green and black tea (P &lt; 0.05). Green tea consumption<br>
  tended to reduce aortic lesion formation by 31% (24 +/- 3.2% versus 35 +/-<br>
  5.7% for control animals P = 0.11), while black tea, vitamin E and<br>
  beta-carotene had no effect. This was in contrast to the resistance of<br>
  isolated LDL to oxidation induced at high copper concentration. Green and<br>
  black tea induced a 13% and 15% (P &lt; 0.05) prolongation of the lag phase,<br>
  respectively, with a correspondingly lower oxidation rate, while vitamin E<br>
  increased the lag phase by 63% (P &lt; 0.01) with a concomitant diminution of<br>
  the oxidation rate and beta-carotene had no effect. Regression analysis<br>
  showed that there was no relationship between the extent of<br>
  atherosclerosis and LDL oxidizability or plasma<br>
  malondialdehyde as marker of in vivo lipid peroxidation. The results of the<br>
  present study raise the question whether LDL oxidizability (at least when<br>
  tested at high induction rate ex vivo) is a primary causal mechanism in<br>
  atherosclerosis in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. The<br>
  suitability of the cholesterol-fed rabbit with extreme hypercholesterolaemia<br>
  as a model to study antiatherosclerotic properties of dietary antioxidants,<br>
  such as the tested polyphenols, is discussed.<br>
