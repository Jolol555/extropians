<i>&gt; Subject:       ExI = Truth First ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reply-to:      extropians@extropy.com</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the Extropian society, is the core principle:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "We acknowledge only those truths that are useful."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such seems to be the consensus, stated in so many </i><br>
<i>&gt; words, of some of the members of this list. If so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then truth is a subset of the set of "utility" (U),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and as such, x is a member of U if and only if x </i><br>
<i>&gt; is useful. So the Extropian principle would be:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "We acknowledge only those things that are useful."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Nazi Party found the extermination of all who </i><br>
<i>&gt; disagreed with their agenda very useful and adhered</i><br>
<i>&gt; faithfully to the utility-first principle that many </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the ExI list adhere to. Does ExI = Nazism? I say </i><br>
<i>&gt; no! I believe it is not the right ExI principle. I </i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that to the extent we are directed to that </i><br>
<i>&gt; principle we are infected with totalitarian memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have advocated utilitarianism, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think there may be a higher principle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With a scientific definition of truth (like perhaps,</i><br>
<i>&gt; X = truth if f:X-&gt;Y = f(a)=f(a'), which is to say, X </i><br>
<i>&gt; is the truth if the mapping of X on to the physical </i><br>
<i>&gt; world Y is a one-one function, i.e., that X is the </i><br>
<i>&gt; truth if X accurately models the physical reality </i><br>
<i>&gt; without contradiction) then what's wrong with an </i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropian "truth first" principle? Maybe some-</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing is wrong with it, I'm not God, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; should this not be defined logically? </i><br>
<i>&gt; But then that would be truthful... no?</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is the logical case against truth?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the case of countering national socialism, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; utility (appealing to the utilitarian) of truth-</i><br>
<i>&gt; first is that it is not true that your agenda, or </i><br>
<i>&gt; your well-being, is maximized by the initiation of </i><br>
<i>&gt; aggression upon other humans. Einstein escaped the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazis, how many Einstein's did not? Even more, not </i><br>
<i>&gt; killing people but using them as slaves also does </i><br>
<i>&gt; not maximize the well-being of slaveholders versus</i><br>
<i>&gt; a society in which all are free to come and go. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The descendants of slave holders are better off </i><br>
<i>&gt; because of free markets, not antebellum slavery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In sum, I believe truth can lead to Extropia!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's wrong with a truth-first principle?</i><br>
<p>
SHO--<br>
I belive nothing to be wrong with the principal, it is just that <br>
people have been taught to think 1 way and if another way of thinking <br>
should arise then they are told that way is wrong and not to belive <br>
that way of thinking.  <br>
<p>
---I do not side with the Nazi's but look at the <br>
good things they did for the world.  the built the Autobahn, <br>
experiminted heavily in medicine (good and bad, which has helped the <br>
U.S. in serving out it's death penalties), they dabbled with <br>
macinery, and much more.---You see this is my view, sure they did <br>
lots of wrong but I have altered my way of thinking to see the good <br>
in people, and I try to stay on task as such.<br>
<p>
If we are talking Gov't, they should be the most flexiable <br>
orginization in the universe.  One reason they are not is that THEY <br>
HAVE FORGOT THAT THEY WORK FOR US, WE DO NOT WORK FOR <br>
THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  At some time i think they branded us with <br>
the assumption that it is the other way around, that is just not <br>
true.<br>
<p>
If people had an open mind they could see that "truth is in the eye of <br>
the beholder".--this has always, will always, and should always be <br>
true (in my eyes).<br>
