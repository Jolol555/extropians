<p>
Four of the five images have the face illuminated from the left side,<br>
lighting the right cheek.  Only the last one has the face lit from the<br>
right, but it is low resolution and you can't make out any detail.<br>
<p>
I can help you find the face in the last three pictures.  Note in<br>
the first two that the face is the leftmost in a series of three or<br>
four small outcroppings of rock, each about the same size as the face.<br>
To the right of these outcroppings are two larger plateaus, the left one<br>
four-sided and very flat, and the right one five- or six-sided with a<br>
mountain on top.  These can help you find the face in the other pictures.<br>
<p>
The third image is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared<br>
to the others.  To help you find the plateaus, first find a pair of<br>
small craters, equal sized and touching, a bit to the right of center.<br>
45 degrees down to the left of this is a larger crater which has a<br>
distinctive straight "wall" just below and to its right.  (This wall is<br>
also claimed to be an artifact, a backdrop for the Face, by enthusiasts.)<br>
The two plateaus are to the right of the wall, the series of outcroppings<br>
lead down from there, with the Face the last in the series.<br>
<p>
The fourth and fifth images are oriented the same as the first two.<br>
In the fourth image, find the two touching craters a bit down and<br>
left from center.  The lone crater with the wall is to the left and a<br>
bit upwards from them.  The two plateaus are below the wall, then the<br>
outcroppings leading to the Face are to the left.<br>
<p>
The fifth image is the most frustrating because it is illuminated from the<br>
right (producing an optical illusion of inverted relief in some areas).<br>
This might be expected to reveal the degree of symmetry in the image, but<br>
the resolution is too poor.<br>
<p>
The two linked craters are halfway down the right edge of the picture.<br>
The lone crater is up to the left from them, but the wall is invisible<br>
in this image.  An imaging artifact in the form of a vertical dashed line<br>
is just to the left of the crater, and if you follow it down it divides<br>
the two plateaus, which are dimly visible.  The outcroppings to the<br>
left of the plateaus are almost invisible, and the face is (presumably)<br>
the last one, but all you can see is a small blob, light on the right<br>
and dark on the left, with no features visible.<br>
