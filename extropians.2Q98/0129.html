<p>
But the majority are also in control of the minority who choose to<br>
vote otherwise - in this case the majority can be seen as the centre.<br>

<i>&gt; I am evidently in a tiny minority, most</i><br>
<i>&gt; restaurants will leave out the cilantro if</i><br>
<i>&gt; I ask them to.</i><br>
<p>
The majority is in control of what food is supplied, even if you don't<br>
buy and eat it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; But what about your firms interaction</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with individuals (i.e. customers)?  Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you consider that a centralist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; relationship?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Where's the center?</i><br>
<p>
The firm would be the centre, even if it is 'controlled' by the<br>
customers.  (As I've said before, even the most totalitarian of<br>
governments are 'controlled' by their people.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your customers control (vote by money)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the company which takes precedence over</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the decisions of individual customers or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; smaller groups of customers. It's a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; incomplete precedence. Individual customers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't set their own prices, decide on which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; products you make, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, not in my present firm, no; I assume all</i><br>
<i>&gt; clients are offered essentially the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; contract.  But my previous employer sets</i><br>
<i>&gt; different terms for each client (often giving</i><br>
<i>&gt; them a choice), because their circumstances</i><br>
<i>&gt; vary and they want different services. In each</i><br>
<i>&gt; case, clients are free to shop around for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better deal, whether for a lower price or for</i><br>
<i>&gt; services more fitting to their needs.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps because of a firm's size they can offer a more individual<br>
deal.  But I'm sure a smaller government doesn't have to generalise<br>
quite so much as a larger government, yet they are both centralist<br>
entities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Where's the center?</i><br>
<p>
Again, the firm is the centre.  Just because it has not been quite so<br>
successful at forcing me to use its product (like a government) it is<br>
not decentralised.  And just because there are more firms than<br>
governments, they are not decentralised.  And just because firms are<br>
smaller than governments, they are not decentralised.<br>
