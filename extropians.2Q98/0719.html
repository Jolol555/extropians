<i>&gt;Yes, you have a lingual problem. It should be perfectly obvious that Daniel</i><br>
<i>&gt;did not mean that he likes to go around forcing people to recant their</i><br>
<i>&gt;religious beliefs at the point of a gun. What he meant by "militant" is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;different from the way it is standardly used: it means you like to pick a</i><br>
<i>&gt;fight. The kind of fights some atheists like to pick are</i><br>
<i>&gt;verbal/intellectual fights, not physical ones.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Pick a fight, yeah. Maybe with people who don't even want to fight. And<br>
still battle them, until their beliefs are shaken in their fundamentals.<br>
Maybe drive them into suicide.<br>
<p>
I work with fundamental Christians. Although I have all the knowledge to<br>
refute their beliefs completely, I don't. Why should I interfere with other<br>
people's lives? But a militant atheist could destroy these lives, even with<br>
words only. That's specific for religion, because it is irrational, it is<br>
always attackable. But the emotions connected with the religous beliefs are<br>
not. And that's why you cannot predict how someone whose worldview has just<br>
been destroyed will react.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't call that mindfucking. I would call it mind rape. And it's a type<br>
of coercion, too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think I've understood it. Probably better than you, the founder.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sure, Erik.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well, just like I think I understand Catholicism better than the Pope.<br>
Religous cults can usually not be correctly interpreted by their leaders,<br>
unless those are perfectly aware of the fact that they are just brainwashing<br>
a horde of money-bearing idiots. The intellectual level of Extropy is<br>
higher, but nevertheless it is a cult and you are its leader.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;BTW, if you're militantly anti-Extropian, you don't belong on this</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular email list. It's intended for Extropians and fellow travellers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're completely free to criticize extropian thinking elsewhere, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Transhuman list, but it's not the function of *this* list.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
OK, I summarize: Extropian thinking must not be criticized on this mailing<br>
list. Your fundamentals are built on sand, and that's why you cannot take<br>
criticism. Of course I haven't even started to seriously criticize Extropy.<br>
But even a little rant in my spare time seems to be too much to take. If my<br>
postings disturb you, why not set up a mail filter? Might make life easier.<br>
