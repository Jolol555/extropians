<i>&gt;What we should really look for is whether homeschooled kids are better</i><br>
<i>&gt;in social interaction than non-homeschooled kids.  The socialization</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue always comes up with homeschooling, yet I've seen no evidence --</i><br>
<i>&gt;just anecdotes -- about whether kids are better or worse off with home-</i><br>
<i>&gt;schooling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My gut feeling is that they are better or no different in this area, but</i><br>
I'd<br>
<i>&gt;like</i><br>
<i>&gt;to see some studies done.</i><br>
<p>
Below are some research papers that have been done.  I got this from the FAQ<br>
of the US Home-Ed Mailing List.  Listed are articles showing that they are<br>
academically the same (or better), that their parents don't need to be<br>
qualified teachers and that socializtion isn't an issue and that they go on<br>
to university or work without difficulty.  Anything else ?<br>

Articles in academic journals about homeschooling can be accessed using the<br>
ERIC database (available in many public and university libraries);<br>
<p>
When searching in ERIC be sure to look at all the forms of the word<br>
"homeschooling" (i.e. home school, home-school, home education, etc.) in<br>
order to get the largest number of references. You can also write to the<br>
National Home Education Research Institute (see above) for details on how to<br>
obtain their current bibliography of home-schooling articles.<br>
<p>
To obtain a copy of a dissertation, be sure to get correct reference numbers<br>
from the University Microfilms International (UMI) Dissertation Abstracts<br>
database or books (according to their literature they are "the only central<br>
source of accessing almost every doctoral dissertation accepted in North<br>
America since 1861").<br>
