That is one of the views I have held for quite a long time. The Christian<br>
Old Testament god is a particularly nasty critter..if this is the way things<br>
actually run, I will be quite happy to take my rightful place in Hell.<br>
<p>
However, I don't think the universe is 'deathist'. Life is just localized<br>
reversal of entropy. As such, it appears the universe is out to get<br>
us...Actually, for the universe to be 'deathist' would presuppose some sort<br>
of controlling organization that cared one way or the other, would it not?<br>

<i>&gt;sufficient evidence of god's existence and/or that this would not be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;disaster for humanity and transhumanists in particular.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If there are gods or a God, I have a hard time seeing any reason why this<br>
being would have any particular interest in the goings-on of Terrans or any<br>
other lifeform, except as far as these beings could evolve to a level<br>
capable of providing stimulating conversation or competition...<br>
