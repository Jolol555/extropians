<p>
As I wrote before, Gary North is a religious fundamentalist who<br>
is well known among Christian millennialists (believers in the<br>
near-term apocalyptic events foretold in the Book of Revelations).<br>
He has written dozens of books on religious topics, focusing on<br>
issues related to the coming apocalypse, long before he heard<br>
of Y2K.  Here is an excerpt from a review of one of his books, at:<br>
<a href="http://metanet.net/freebooks/docs/2142_47e.htm">http://metanet.net/freebooks/docs/2142_47e.htm</a><br>
<p>
: Here is the main question: Will Jesus' Great Commission be fulfilled in<br>
: history? Will nations be discipled by the Church? Will God bring judgment<br>
: against His enemies in history? Most important, do we have enough time<br>
: for the healing power of the gospel to do its work?  Two millennial views<br>
: say no, there isn't enough time: premillennialism and amillennialism<br>
: ("pessimillennialism"). A third view says yes, there is enough time:<br>
: post-millennialism. The revival of interest in this third view has<br>
: taken both rival camps by surprise. By tying a vision of victory in<br>
: history to the doctrine that the Bible offers specific answers to social<br>
: problems, a new movement has begun to capture the minds of a generation<br>
: of Christian activists. The movement is called Christian Reconstruction.<br>
: In Millennialism and Social Theory, Dr. Gary North, co-founder of this<br>
: movement, examines why both pre-millennialism and amillennialism have<br>
: never developed independent social theories, and why the spokesmen of<br>
: both positions appeal to the prevailing ethics of contemporary humanism<br>
: as the only possible way to run society.<br>
<p>
I believe North sees Y2K in religious terms, as an element of the "end<br>
times" which have long been foretold.  His Y2K site is largely secular,<br>
until you read the bulletin boards where some of his long time followers<br>
retain their religious views.<br>
<p>
The point is, North is filtering the data he presents through his<br>
religious ideas.  It is a biased presentation designed to lead to the<br>
desired apocalyptic conclusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems pretty fatalistic and I'm not at all sure if it has to be this</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad, on the other hand: most nuclearpowerplants, aiports, utility</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies, armies are not yet year-2000 certified. Fireworks ;-). The same</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes for many logistical systems that supply supermarkets and such. No-one</i><br>
<i>&gt; can tell for sure what the extent of the damage wil be. Maybe your company</i><br>
<i>&gt; has been y2K-certified, but have all it's supliers? And if the bankng</i><br>
<i>&gt; system goes bust how wil anyone buy your product?</i><br>
<p>
The operative sentence here is "No-one can tell for sure what the extent<br>
of the damage will be."  That is really the only thing you can say with<br>
any certainty about Y2K.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or, strictly economically speaking (Gary North):</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;             What happens to T-bills and T-bonds if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;       IRS computer breaks down and a tax revolt spreads</i><br>
<i>&gt;       because taxpayers know the IRS will never find</i><br>
<i>&gt;       them, and that if they pay their taxes, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;       won't get their refunds?</i><br>
<p>
If the IRS doesn't pay out refunds, they'll have a real problem.<br>
Presumably this is one of the mission critical areas they are fixing<br>
first.  As for not paying your taxes and hoping the IRS won't catch<br>
you because it will crash, who would take that risk?  After all, even<br>
if there are glitches around Y2K, as long as the IRS survives they will<br>
eventually get things fixed, and then they'll come after you.  So you<br>
are basically betting on the collapse of the government if you take this<br>
strategy.  North and his fellow fanatics may do this, but the average<br>
person, whose taxes are automatically withheld every paycheck, won't<br>
be willing to take the chance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;             What happens to money market funds and bond</i><br>
<i>&gt;       funds that invest heavily in government debt when</i><br>
<i>&gt;       investors realize that if the IRS can't collect</i><br>
<i>&gt;       taxes, the government will default on its debt?</i><br>
<p>
This is based on the assumption that the IRS will fail and people will<br>
stop paying taxes, but as I said that seems unrealistic.  Even if it<br>
has some slowdowns, the IRS should be able to get through the backlog<br>
and keep revenues coming.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;             What happens to the banks when depositors</i><br>
<i>&gt;       figure out that the FDIC is bankrupt and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;       nobody insures their accounts any more?</i><br>
<p>
This has been bandied about for at least 15 years.  There were record bank<br>
failures in the late 1980s and survivalists gleefully predicted disaster.<br>
But we got through it.<br>
<p>
The Fed has already pledged to "make liquidity available" as needed during<br>
any Y2K problems.  I read this as basically meaning that they won't allow<br>
banks to fail due to the bug.  If some bank can't repay a loan to another,<br>
the Fed will guarantee the loan, so the house of cards remains standing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;             What happens to your job when the banks</i><br>
<i>&gt;       close because of bank runs, and no business can</i><br>
<i>&gt;       borrow money or even write a check to its</i><br>
<i>&gt;       employees?</i><br>
<p>
This is piling uncertainty upon unlikelihood.  From here on out North's<br>
scenarios become ever more farfetched.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's not discuss how great it would be if the IRS died (we can agree to</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagree or now, I think), but which research institutions could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; damaged. How long can Alcor last without power? How can they rescue</i><br>
<i>&gt; patients if the phones are out? If only a fraction of what Gary North</i><br>
<i>&gt; predicts is true some transhuman goals could very well go down the drain or</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite some time.</i><br>
<p>
Alcor relies on manually pouring LN2 into the dewars every few days.<br>
They are not electrically powered.  Obviously a collapse of civilization<br>
means the LN2 is going to stop being available eventually.  But a more<br>
likely scenario with scattered, localized disruptions should mean no<br>
more than a few days of power outages.<br>
<p>
Let me turn the question around.  Suppose power and phones stay up.<br>
It should be clear that most of the problems can be dealt with by human<br>
ingenuity.  People are not slaves to their machines.  If some computers<br>
don't work, they may have to do things a little slower, but after a few<br>
days they will adjust.<br>
<p>
Power companies cope with failures in the grid all the time.  The system<br>
is designed to stay up in the face of localized failures.  Generally it<br>
has been quite robust.  The same is true of the phone system.  There<br>
have been a few incidents in which localized errors managed to bring down<br>
larger regions, but these are extremely rare.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Mr. North also describes the psychology-of-denial that is being practiced</i><br>
<i>&gt; by many managers and governement officials "don't worry, we've got it under</i><br>
<i>&gt; control". The idea that everything could come to a grinding halt is so</i><br>
<i>&gt; fanatastic that it is dismissed "they will find a solution". If you did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; hear about the Y2K-problem untill now you might have the same reaction (I</i><br>
<i>&gt; still have it - a little ;-).</i><br>
<p>
When I first began learning about Y2K, I became quite alarmed.  I read<br>
Ed Yourdon's book (Time Bomb 2000) and studied Gary North's web site.  I<br>
started checking companies that offer a year's supply of food, and how<br>
much space I would need in the garage for it.  I looked into solar<br>
electricity generation vs buying a generator and storing gas.<br>
<p>
Then, I learned more about the people involved.  I discovered North's<br>
background, and I saw that Yourdon is hawking his Y2K consultancy on<br>
his web page.  I read criticisms by a power engineer of Yourdon's<br>
fearmongering about electricity disruption.  The bulletin board<br>
discussions were dominated by the same kinds of people who have been<br>
predicting disaster since the 1970's.<br>
<p>
My current belief is that there is going to be a significant economic<br>
impact due to the bug, to the expense of fixing it, and to people's<br>
reactions and worries about it.  We've had a long peacetime expansion<br>
and it's about time for a recession, anyway.  I believe worry about Y2K<br>
will be the trigger.  There will be disruptions and failures, but they<br>
will be localized.  Some businesses which have Y2K failures while the<br>
competition is compliant will go under, throwing people out of work.<br>
Unemployment will increase, the economy will contract, stock prices<br>
will fall.  It could be a severe recession.<br>
<p>
It all adds up to a bad situation.  But it's not the end of the world<br>
that people like North are predicting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not totally unrelated: What if the general populace does not trust</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers anymore after a big crash? What would the impact be on future</i><br>
<i>&gt; adavancement in AI-research? This could have serious impact on things like</i><br>
<i>&gt; a singularity and technical advances in general (quite difficult to design</i><br>
<i>&gt; or run a spaceship without computers).</i><br>
<p>
I can't see this.  Computers aren't like they were in the 1960's, vague,<br>
threatening behemoths off in a sterile computer room somewhere.  They're<br>
in our wristwatches, our pagers, our toaster ovens.  What, am I supposed<br>
to "not trust" my microwave because there was a Y2K crash?<br>
<p>
More likely than this is North's scenario of people turning on computer<br>
programmers as the villains whose lazy programming caused the Y2K problem.<br>
Some people suggest that computer programmers will walk away from their<br>
jobs in 1999 when they see that the Y2K problem is going to hit hard,<br>
and they don't want to be around when the mobs come drooling for blood.<br>
This will then make the Y2K fixes that much farther behind schedule,<br>
according to this scenario.  Dramatic, but pretty far fetched if you ask<br>
me.<br>
