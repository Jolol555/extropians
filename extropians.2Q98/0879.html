Details matter.  Universal (including women) suffrage is recent.  The English<br>
common law developed over the past 1000 years.  Fast communications make<br>
things like credit cards and really large democracies possible which couldn't<br>
have happened in the past.<br>

Ideal free markets, no.  Ideal versions of anything are rare.  Widespread <br>
private property and generally free exchange are common to all materially<br>
prosperous societies.  The freedom varies; so, in positive correlation, does<br>
the adaptability of the society.<br>
<p>
Arguing about anarchic free markets may be like arguing about the Singularity<br>
coming in 8 years, catalyzed by a web browser.  Interesting theory, but so out<br>
of whack with current reality that it can't gain acceptance until it actually<br>
happens.<br>

assasinations 'n' (more) corporate espionage?"<br>
  You generally want to avoid getting local prosecutors involved.  They<br>
actually put people in jail, on occasion.<br>
