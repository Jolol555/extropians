<i>&gt; I use "atheist" as one who believes that</i><br>

Given that definition, your approach to theological questions sounds quite<br>
reasonable.  But, I'm left wondering, where does that leave the distinction<br>
between atheism and agnostism?  Cannot an agnostic hold, after all, that there<br>
exists no solid proof of gods and that believing in gods constitutes an utter<br>
waste of time?  That is, cannot an agnostic agree with you that it is (for the<br>
practical reasons you described) "wrong" to believe in god?<br>
<p>
It makes more sense, I think, to hold that atheists believe that gods do not<br>
exist whereas agnostics shrug off such questions as beyond rational discourse.<br>
That is, atheists disbelieve in gods; agnostics do not believe in gods.<br>
