<i>&gt;So, are you a mind rapist, too, Erik? You like to attack free markets which</i><br>
<i>&gt;form a tremendously important part of some people's worldview.</i><br>
<p>
If we stay with the analogy, those were just slaps in the face. Not polite,<br>
but it can wake people up. I would be more careful with posting a complete<br>
analysis of free markets and their implications on this list, although I do<br>
not think that you are *that* far from reality.<br>
<p>
I agree with what you say about religions. But I prefer to fight the<br>
institutions than to fight their followers. What's the use in destroying the<br>
beliefs of a happy family? If the institutions vanish, the religous cults<br>
will be reduced to a toleratable minimum. I do my best to collect facts<br>
about the church and the crimes of religion (knowledge monopolization in the<br>
Middle Ages, the crusades, Vatican participation in the Holocaust,<br>
Jasenovac, the role of the church in Ruanda, abortion, prevention and<br>
overpopulation, maybe even the shroud of Turin fake). If you want to destroy<br>
religion, you gotta do it slowly.<br>
<p>
I never said that Lee Daniel Crocker wants to destroy anybody's lives, I<br>
just said that it could happen and this would contradict with the idea of<br>
non-coercion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Retract what you say, or else prove it. Otherwise I *will* have you removed</i><br>
<i>&gt;from this list.</i><br>
<p>
I retract from saying that you are the Extropian leader. Sorry, this was the<br>
wrong choice of words.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Criticism is fine, but this is not the place for it. The Transhuman list</i><br>
<i>&gt;and many other places are available for that. I think the reason you cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to grasp this simple point is that you don't want to. You would rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;attack than understand.</i><br>
<p>
Not really. I just see a danger in locking out people with strongly<br>
differing opinions. I did not want this debate, it is a waste of time for<br>
both of us, but I don't want to be mistaken. If you allow me to question the<br>
basics of Extropy on the list, I propose that I will restrain myself to<br>
posting criticism founded with facts instead of my usual rant. Is this OK<br>
for you?<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Erik Moeller<br>
