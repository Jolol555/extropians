<p>
<p>
   IAN: Hinduism does have one supreme being, Brahman.<br>
   It is said that all the other gods, such a Shiva, <br>
   Kali, Gahnesh, Uma... are but faces of the supreme<br>
   being that is Brahman. Brahman has no form or personal <br>
   identity and is said to be "The Great Void -- in zero <br>
   mechanics, this it the zero-sum of all difference.<br>
<p>
   Of course, Hinduism is an extremely complex system <br>
   of "sub-religions," each with it's own unique spin.<br>
<p>
   The example of Buddhism and Taoism tend to fit with <br>
   your argument, but not in that they have many gods,<br>
   but that their concept of a "supreme being" is very <br>
   difficult to define, and not dissimilar from Brahman<br>
   in that the supreme is nonpersonal and void, or zero.<br>
   I believe that zero mechanics maps out this "supreme<br>
   being" and absolves the need for religious mystique<br>
   and custom <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/meta.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/meta.htm</a> <br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Added to this, it's a well know fact that religious groups</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't exactly appreciate each other's views.  Anyone advocating the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Christian God isn't likely to go down well with other religions that</i><br>
<i>&gt;make up the majority of that 95%... </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: We've been brought up in a world where religion,<br>
   almost as a rule, defines all others as bound for hell,<br>
   as false religions, or even Satanic plots to deceive.<br>
   Hindus and Buddhists are far more tolerant of other<br>
   religions than we see in Christian tradition, which <br>
   is pretty much defined by the claim that all non-<br>
   believers are bound for hell. Hinduism embraces<br>
   Buddha as a great saint and even Jesus in many <br>
   cases. This may be a good strategy to keep the <br>
   folks at home, so to say. If your religion embraces<br>
   all religions, it may also embrace all people, i.e.,<br>
   have a large and profitable following. Why leave <br>
   Hinduism for Buddhism if Buddha is also a Hindu saint?<br>
<p>
   Here's a good quote from The Oxford Companion to <br>
   Philosophy (page 355) that highlights the far-more-<br>
   tolerant nature of eastern religious traditions: <br>
<p>
     "Unlike Christianity or Islam, Hinduism is a <br>
     nonproselytizing religion based on the Vedic <br>
     principle that 'Reality is one, but different <br>
     religious teachers speak of it differently'."<br>
