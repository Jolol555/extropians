<i>&gt;Only one problem... the Irish government have made clear on many</i><br>
<i>&gt;occasions that they don't want the IRA and definitely don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Northern Protestants; AFAIR they even changed their</i><br>
<i>&gt;constitution recently to remove any claim on Northern Ireland. You</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't seriously suggest dumping millions of Protestants into one</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the most staunchly Catholic countries on the planet?</i><br>
<p>
Who's dumping who? They already live there..... When I was a<br>
practicing Catholic most of my neighbors were Protestant, we didn't<br>
go around killing each other over it. The difference in religion is<br>
just a small part of it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Uh, so an Irish Protestant who was born in Ireland, grew up in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ireland, lives in Ireland, and comes from a family that's been</i><br>
<i>&gt;living in Ireland for centuries is an invader? I think you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;letting emotion get in the way of reality; which is the main</i><br>
<i>&gt;reason why nothing has been solved in Ireland despite decades of</i><br>
<i>&gt;warfare.</i><br>
<p>
Loyalists do not consider Northern Ireland part of Ireland, nor<br>
themselves Irish, but a party of Britain and themselves British<br>
citizens. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In reality, of course, while the soldiers have on many occasions</i><br>
<i>&gt;acted reprehensively against the Republicans -- and IMHO some</i><br>
<i>&gt;should have been up in court on murder charges for it -- their</i><br>
<i>&gt;main job is to keep the Republican extremists and Unionist</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremists apart, not to act as an invading force.</i><br>
<p>
Like a few months ago when they led the Loyalists on a march<br>
through Catholic neighborhoods?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;But the vast majority of Northern Irish don't want that, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Irish government don't want that, so how is it going to happen?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Trust me, the majority of British people and government would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;glad to get rid of Northern Ireland and give it to the South if</i><br>
<i>&gt;they could do so.</i><br>
<p>
I've never met anyone of Irish decent who did not want<br>
reunification. If troops are needed to keep the factions apart for<br>
now they should be U.N. troops, not British soldiers. This would be<br>
a good first step.<br>
<p>
This is the extropian component of this subject, how could we<br>
resolve this conflict, and what actions could we take in the future<br>
to avoid creating these situations?<br>
