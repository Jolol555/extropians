<p>
I would say a couple things:<br>
<p>
a) yeah, while the Christ we all know about through the 2000 year filtered<br>
compendium we know as the Bible may not be quite as selfless or whatever as<br>
buddha, but for the time and place he was in, I think that the general concept<br>
of willingly getting nailed to a tree for suggesting that it would be cool for<br>
people to be nice to each other for a change was a profoundly courageous act.<br>
Buddha was in India 500 years previously, so his teachings had extremely little<br>
influence on the development of the Roman Empire, while the pseudobiographical<br>
texts about Jesus basically changed the very make up of the Empire, to give it<br>
the potential for the West to become what it is today.<br>
<p>
b) while the East has had a long tradition of very pacifistic spiritual<br>
development prior to Buddha, there was none such (except for small groups like<br>
the Essenes) in the Middle East or Europe at the time of Jesus, he was a bit of<br>
a pioneer in the region for what he had to say.<br>
<p>
c) keep in mind that the Bible as we know it is only a small part of all of the<br>
biographical texts, and that the two gospels which were actually written by<br>
actual disciples of Jesus were left out of the Bible because they weren't<br>
conducive to a stern autocratic Church. The four gospels that are in the Bible<br>
were written 70-150 years after the death of Jesus, and are thus open to<br>
significant debate as to whether the quotes attributed to Jesus are actually<br>
what he said. The Gospel of Thomas, and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene can be<br>
found in the Nag Hammadi, along with a number of other texts which paint a much<br>
different picture of Jesus.<br>
<p>
d) keep in mind also that Jesus was more of a political figure than the Bible<br>
lets on. Since the marriage of his two parents reunited the two Houses of David<br>
(and his purported marriage at Cana to Mary Magdalene would have united the<br>
House of David with the House of Saul) he was a royal figure in Isreal, and was<br>
looked on as a revolutionary figure to save Isreal from the Romans, as had been<br>
foretold. Being raised with such expectations, its not hard to imagine that one<br>
would at least have some capacity to be a royal pain in the ass at least once in<br>
a while. One can also imagine that this is why he got crucified in the end, that<br>
he turned out not to be quite the revolutionary general his fellow Hebrews had<br>
hoped for, and so they willingly turned him over to Pilate in exchange for<br>
Barrabbas, a proven zealot fighter, so that Pilate could give Jesus the<br>
punishment reserved for those who would revolt against Rome. If he had been<br>
convicted of blasphemy and sacrelidge as had been claimed in the Bible, then<br>
Hebrew law dictated that he be stoned to death.<br>
<p>
Given all this, I would also put emails from Jesus in my kill file, as I'm not<br>
in the mood to get strung up and disemboweled, thank you, for associating with a<br>
known subversive figure who can't seem to pull of a decent revolt, has little<br>
military inclination, and succeeds in pissing off as many people around him as<br>
possible....<br>
<p>
Give me someone who knows how to keep their mouth shut, can operate a decent<br>
cell network, and can obtain support for the subversion campaign from outside<br>
sources. No matter how pacifistic you want to get, any group with a hope of<br>
success should at least be able to do these three things....<br>
