<i>&gt; I have been on the extropians mailing list now for a few months and I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; noticed that very few posts are made in respect to short term views.  While</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's commendable to be visionary I would think that many extropians would</i><br>
<i>&gt; concern themselves with what could be done presently to assure a transhumanist</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence in the future.  Is there much collaboration on this level?  I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; like to take more of an activist's position in exploring transhumanist</i><br>
<i>&gt; avenues.  Any recommendations?</i><br>
<p>
I think practical transhumanism is very worthwhile; while theoretical<br>
studies help to guide us and get the long view, in the end we better<br>
get transhuman ourselves too.<br>
<p>
I think den Otter had a good idea about setting up some kind of server<br>
or index over enhancing technologies (including things like mental<br>
techniques and psychological tools), this would be very useful but<br>
tricky to implement. We would really benefit from having an overview<br>
of the areas we are interested in, which of course would help us see<br>
what areas need to be developed and who could help.<br>
<p>
Overall, the spread of simple, practical methods for enhanced living<br>
are one of the best ways of promoting extropianism. A kind of<br>
grass-roots transhumanism, so to say.<br>
