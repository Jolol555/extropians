Isn't part of the problem with privacy debates that they rely on a<br>
private/public distinction (resonating with the image of the "individual"<br>
confronting the "state") that is getting creaky with age?  What does<br>
privacy mean in the first place when we're talking about hive minds and<br>
globe-girdling competing PPLs?  It does seem that surveillance is only<br>
getting more powerful and more ubiquitous.  If that is the case, we may be<br>
able to preserve functional privacy only by multiplying the perspectives<br>
from which we are monitored.  We are in a sense veiled when we<br>
are multiply surveilled, precisely because the institutions and<br>
individuals that track us are all *interested* ones and so too their<br>
perspectives will be interested.  In other words, "privacy" may come to<br>
mean a space of interpretive indeterminacy produced by the collision of<br>
indefinitely many competing institutional interpreters.  Best, Dale       <br>
