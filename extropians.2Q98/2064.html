This is a start, though it is a highly intuitive argument with some<br>
problems.  For<br>
instance, it is debatable that humans were the top predator species until long<br>
after they came to be.  There seems to be some evidence that early humans<br>
were scavengers.  Even though many predators resort to scavenging, if humans<br>
were scavenging, is there any reason to believe that had humans coexisted<br>
with dinosuars, they could not just as easily scavenged off of the latter?<br>
<p>
There is more to it than this, but I'm moving tomorrow, so I've to run.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
