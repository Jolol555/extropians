Aha, that makes a certain amount of sense. It could be a growth factor<br>
affecting among other things neural tissue (I seem to recall that the<br>
IGF family acts as local growth factors, released (or identical to?)<br>
the somatomedins).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not much is  </i><br>
<i>&gt; known about this hormone but interestingly another scientist Dr. Randy Jirtle  </i><br>
<i>&gt; has independently studied it for years and has had a suspicion it's involved </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the metabolism of the brain, he thinks a link to IQ is plausible. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dr. Plomin says there are  probably about 50 genes responsible for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between the 100 IQ kids and the 160 IQ kids in his study, this is </i><br>
<i>&gt; just the first. He also said that he doubted that any one kid had all 50 </i><br>
<i>&gt; genes.</i><br>
<p>
The question is how they interact. I wouldn't be the least surprised<br>
if having all of them would be bad due to nonlinear interactions. For<br>
example, one could promote one beneficial neural growth process and<br>
another for another process, but these two processes interfere<br>
slightly. Mapping these interactions is an interesting problem.<br>
