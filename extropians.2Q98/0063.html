<i>&gt; From:          "den Otter" &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Centralized systems are not inherently bad, they just take some smart</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizing and some well-placed checks and balances. It sure beats</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchy (remember this setup is meant for Jack the Lad, not responsible</i><br>
<i>&gt; and independent people like *us*), which is beyond anyone's control.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A centralized system can be benevolent in its intentions, anarchy, like</i><br>
<p>
And there is the fallacy.  A centralized system CANNOT be benevolent <br>
in its intentions.  For that matter, it cannot be malevolent either.  <br>
This is because a "system" cannot have intentions.  Only individuals <br>
have intentions.<br>
<p>
The FOUNDERS of that centralized system might have had benevolent <br>
intentions.  Are they still in control of the system?  Do they still <br>
have those intentions?  Do their successors have those intentions?<br>
<p>
There are two factors arguing *against* the notion that a <br>
centralized system will remain consistent with its founders' original <br>
good intentions.<br>
<p>
One applies to any organization: the organization *cannot* pursue <br>
those good intentions if it ceases to exist.  On the other hand, it <br>
can pursue its current controllers' goals more effectively if it <br>
grows in size and wealth/power.  Therefore, from the get-go, some <br>
portion of the institution's efforts must go to self-preservation and <br>
self-aggrandisement as opposed to any other objective.  The larger <br>
fraction of its efforts go to these purposes, the more successful it <br>
is likely to be in competition against other organizations.  <br>
Therefore these efforts tend to take over the organization <br>
completely.<br>
<p>
The second applies disproportionately to government.  If you wish to <br>
create opportunities for a million people to run their own lives more <br>
effectively, or to become wealthy, or to be happy, or any thing that <br>
people would welcome into their own lives, there are a million ways <br>
you can do that and very few of them require the force of government. <br>
 On the other hand, if you wish to make a million people miserable, <br>
or make a million people do whatever you want them to do without <br>
compensation, or simply take wealth away from a million people, or <br>
any other thing they would NOT welcome into their lives, there is <br>
really only one reliable way to achieve this goal: through <br>
government.  Therefore the latter sort of people are <br>
disproportionately represented in government; and since they want to <br>
be the controllers, not the controlled, they won't consider <br>
themselves bound by anyone's intentions but their own (except perhaps <br>
as a matter of expediency).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; nature itself, doesn't give a crap about fairness or individual well-being.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's simply survival of the fittest in its most basic form. Although I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; like nation states or bureacracies, I do belief that leaving them intact</i><br>
<i>&gt; while repairing the some of the major flaws is better than the gamble</i><br>
<i>&gt; of anarchy. Anarchy is inherently unstable and leads to hierarchy, often </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the opressive kind. Just check any history book.</i><br>
<p>
While I believe that centralized government is inherently either bad <br>
from the get-go or doomed to become bad, I will also agree with you <br>
that anarchy is unstable and leads to centralized government -- <br>
usually of a *very* bad sort.<br>
<p>
However, looking at history isn't much help, because all the great <br>
examples of "anarchy" (at least, all of them I have checked) prove on <br>
closer examination to be examples not of the *absence* of government, <br>
but of the *overabundance* of government -- as in, several of them <br>
claiming and exercising the authority of government over a single <br>
area.  It would be too much to hope for, that all these governments <br>
would succeed in killing each other off completely while somehow <br>
leaving the populace and their productive capacity mostly intact...<br>
