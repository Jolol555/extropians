<i>&gt; In reality nature IS...and doesn't much give a hoot one way or</i><br>
<i>&gt; another. We can sit in our sand pile and paint our bellies blue and</i><br>
<i>&gt; bow and scrape to made up gods...or not.  If we make it fine...if</i><br>
<i>&gt; not...well how many million species are we aware of that went</i><br>
<i>&gt; extinct?  Does nature care? Of course not...the very concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "caring" and "nature" is an anthropomorphism....and incorrect.</i><br>
<p>
	I think differently.  Look at all the billions of $$s we spend<br>
on natural history museums and research and so on trying to bring back<br>
as much of the extinct past as possible!  Surely in the future this<br>
immense and powerful carring will be greatly amplified and empowered<br>
and infinitely more successful.  We are, after all, part of nature,<br>
and thereby, nature most definitely does care.  Nature has been<br>
working ceaselessly for billions of years to get to this point where<br>
we can finally start to really care.  Now that we finally do, we have<br>
just gotten started.  As the old saying goes, you aint seen noth'n<br>
yet!  Just give it a chance, realize that you are part of nature, and<br>
help out a bit!<br>
