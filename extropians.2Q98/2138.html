<i>&gt; functioning</i><br>
<i>&gt;  at or below middle school level.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  That is todays norm!</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ralph, how much of this is the result of poor schools, how much the fault of</i><br>
<i>&gt; unmotivated students?.. what other causes do you see for these results?.. any</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas on how a transhumanist type can help change this?..or is it too late?..</i><br>
<i>&gt; i have a young daughter and frankly, if she gets the same sort of public</i><br>
<i>&gt; education i did, she's going to rather hopelessly lost.  on the other hand the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost of a private school or tutor is not something i'm at all certain i can</i><br>
<i>&gt; afford.  ( tho, i realise that maybe she can't afford for me not to afford</i><br>

Given ordinary intellect and supportive intellectual parents, IMHO a child can <br>
get a better education by spending 2 hours twice a week at a public library than <br>
by going to a public school for 30 hours a week.<br>
<p>
Depending on the age of this young daughter, be sure to:<br>
  * read to her<br>
  * help her read<br>
  * read for yourself, where she can see you doing it<br>
  * include both light reading and serious study in your reading<br>
  * comparable stuff for arithmetic and, later, math <br>
  * buy her books and intellectual toys that are appropriate to her<br>
    age level -- *and* some that are a bit beyond her.<br>
  * talk about current events, history, science,... in her presence<br>
  * study enough to know what you're talking about<br>
  * make it apparent that you enjoy all this stuff<br>
  * live near a library plus have a lot of books of your own<br>
  * get her her own library card as soon as she can sign her name on it<br>
  * visit the library at least weekly<br>
  * let her have free run of the books in the library<br>
<p>
Do this, and you are extremely likely to have a well-educated child no matter <br>
what doesn't happen at her school.<br>
