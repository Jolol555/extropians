Michael,<br>
<p>
As someone with an intense historical interest in the development of the<br>
Christian faith, I'm intrigued by some of the points you've made.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;<br>
b) while the East has had a long tradition of very pacifistic spiritual<br>
development prior to Buddha, there was none such (except for small groups<br>
like<br>
the Essenes) in the Middle East or Europe at the time of Jesus, he was a<br>
bit of<br>
a pioneer in the region for what he had to say.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Actually, from my reading, I have the impression that almost nothing he<br>
purportedly said or did was original with him. What do you think is unique<br>
about his teaching?<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
c) keep in mind that the Bible as we know it is only a small part of all of<br>
the<br>
biographical texts, and that the two gospels which were actually written by<br>
actual disciples of Jesus were left out of the Bible because they weren't<br>
conducive to a stern autocratic Church. The four gospels that are in the<br>
Bible<br>
were written 70-150 years after the death of Jesus, and are thus open to<br>
significant debate as to whether the quotes attributed to Jesus are<br>
actually<br>
what he said. The Gospel of Thomas, and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene can be<br>
found in the Nag Hammadi, along with a number of other texts which paint a<br>
much<br>
different picture of Jesus.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I'm with you on this, except I never heard of a Gospel of Mary Magdalene. I<br>
thought I knew of all of the NT apocrypha. Can you point me to a reference?<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
d) keep in mind also that Jesus was more of a political figure than the<br>
Bible<br>
lets on. Since the marriage of his two parents reunited the two Houses of<br>
David<br>
(and his purported marriage at Cana to Mary Magdalene would have united the<br>
House of David with the House of Saul) he was a royal figure in Isreal,<br>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
What's this about the two Houses of David? I don't find such in my studies<br>
of ancient literature (not that I'm anything like an erudite scholar). And<br>
what's the basis for asserting that Jesus married the Magdalene? I've seen<br>
speculation on this, and it titllates my fancy, but I know of no actual<br>
confirming evidence. I'd be greatly in your debt if you could provide<br>
references for these contentions.<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
Given all this, I would also put emails from Jesus in my kill file, as I'm<br>
not<br>
in the mood to get strung up and disemboweled, thank you, for associating<br>
with a<br>
known subversive figure who can't seem to pull of a decent revolt, has<br>
little<br>
military inclination, and succeeds in pissing off as many people around him<br>
as<br>
possible....<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
ROTFL!<br>
<p>
Upward,<br>
Dick<br>
