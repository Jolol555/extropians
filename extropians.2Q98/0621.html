Hmm... how does this account for the population of China?  Even if there<br>
were no other Buddhists in the world, all the natural religions were<br>
located in China(which I assume would be Taoism), and all Confucists were<br>
located in China, this would still leave over 0.7 billion Chinese having no<br>
religion-- has Christianity become the predominant religion in China, or is<br>
there a large number of athiests?(maybe Maoists are under-reporting their<br>
figures)  Do either of these options seem reasonable?  I really don't think<br>
so.  If these figures *are* right, it seems that under 80% of the world's<br>
population even has a religion, supreme being or not. (if I've done my math<br>
right)  However, I don't think not belonging to an organized religion<br>
implies that one does not believe in a supreme being, or vica versa.  So, I<br>
would say the 95% figure is probably an overshot, and at the very least it<br>
is not grounded with solid evidence.<br>
