9 YEAR OLD DISPUTES 'THERAPEUTIC TOUCH'<br>
<p>
A study conducted by a 9 year old girl for a science project and <br>
published in a distingished medical journal concludes that <br>
'therapeutic touch,' in which a healer supposedly manipulates a <br>
patient's energy field, is bunk.<br>
<p>
Emily Rosa, the daughter of a registered nurse and an inventor, found <br>
that 21 experienced practitioners were unable to detect the field <br>
they supposedly manipulated to heal.  Her study was published in today's Journal of the American Medical <br>
Association and immediately drew fire from supporters of the <br>
practice, who say it is respected worldwide.  <br>
<p>
Thereaputic touch has been used to treat problems ranging from burns <br>
to cancer.  The technique is practiced in at least 80 North American <br>
hospitals and taught in more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 <br>
countries, said the study, written by the Lovelace, Colorado, fourth <br>
grader, her parents, and a Pennsylvania doctor who works to uncover <br>
quackery.  <br>
<p>
Those who practice the technique say an energy field emanates from<br>
every person and is detectable above the skin through a tingling<br>
sensation or a feeling of hot and cold.  Emily set up a cardboard  <br>
screen through which practitioners put their hands.  With their sight <br>
blocked, she asked them to identify which of their hands was near one <br>
of hers.  The 21 practitioners chose the correct hand 44 percent of <br>
the time.  That was slightly less than the 50 percent chance they <br>
would have had of choosing the correct hand by guessing, authors <br>
said.<br>
