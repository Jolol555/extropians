I have read a "teach-yourself" PhotoReading book from the originating<br>
company. I no longer own this book; perhaps their courses are better.<br>
<p>
Briefly, their method involved studying the book's structure, reading for a<br>
definite purpose, using your finger as a visual-aid and outlining. This is<br>
all pretty standard for improved reading skill courses. Their claims of<br>
enormous speed come from their one novel suggestion: soft-focussing on a<br>
book's pages<br>
and turning them at a steady rpaid rate supposedly allowing the<br>
"subconscious" mind to absorb the information.<br>
<p>
I got no real benefit, but I read naturally at about 400-600 wpm or better.<br>
This varies with the material's difficulty and familiarity, of course. "How<br>
fast can you read?" is as meaningful as "How fast can you drive?". A<br>
familiar road under the best conditions allows high speeds; a well-loved<br>
book with an interested reader also allows high speeds.<br>
<p>
My (unsolicited) advice is to read "How to Read a Book," by Mortimer J.<br>
Adler. I don't know where you can find it auf Deustch, but amazon.com may<br>
sell it. This text covers reading skills other than speed techniques.<br>
Instruction on these can be had from just about any "read fast" book on the<br>
market.<br>
<p>
Hope this helps.<br>
