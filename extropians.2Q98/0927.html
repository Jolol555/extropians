Steve Butts very helpfully recapitulates George H. Smith's comments on the<br>
distinction between atheism and agnosticism.  George does great work, but I do<br>
not agree with him (or Max, who offered a similar argument) that we should<br>
define "atheism" so as to equal "without belief in god."  As I noted to Max,<br>
that definition would make an atheist one who had never even encountered the<br>
notion of god.  George apparently embraces this oddity:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; when a baby is born it (probably) has no concept of God or any</i><br>
<i>&gt; other form of theistic beliefs, therefore it is an atheism.</i><br>
<p>
At the same time, however, George would have "atheist" embrace the ardent<br>
rationalist who has scrutinized and forthrightfully rejected the possibility<br>
of any divine existence.  I think this range of meanings gives the word an<br>
unhelpfully broad definition, not to mention one that does not jibe with<br>
common usage.  Dictionaries typically define "atheist" as "one who denies<br>
God's existence" or the like.<br>
<p>
What about the linguistic argument?  Proponents of the broad definition of<br>
"atheism" miss there, too.  The roots of "atheism" do not, contrary to<br>
George's claim, mean "without theistic belief."  Rather, the word comes from<br>
"atheos" which means "without god."  <br>
<p>
"Atheos" refers the (non)existence of god--not about the prescence of a<br>
belief.  And "atheists" are people who consider themselves "a theos."  A baby<br>
thus does not qualify; rather, only one who consciously denies the existence<br>
of gods qualifies as an "atheist."<br>
<p>
Given that agnostics have so often faced the claim that they are "atheists<br>
without the courgage of their convictions," I find it curious that some<br>
atheists are trying to assume the diffident attitudes of agnostics.  It would<br>
fit common usage and etymology better, I think, for atheists to suck it up and<br>
claim they disbelieve in gods.  <br>
<p>
My advice to wavering atheists:  Ignore the agnostic's claim that you cannot<br>
disprove the existence of god, arguing instead that you have as much proof as<br>
you need.  After all, reasonable people believe a variety of things without<br>
logical or scientific backing; common sense works well enough, and it simply<br>
does not support the notion that gods exist.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying an atheist would convince me with this claim.  All I'm saying<br>
is that I'd respect the atheists for sticking up for his/her (dis)beliefs.<br>
