----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: Tony Belding &lt;tlbelding@htcomp.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another point is that there may be other moral imperatives to consider, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; are more important than happiness.  Happiness is usually rooted in mere</i><br>
<i>&gt; biology, and IMHO is a shallow goal for human beings.  But that is another</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion entirely.  It is probably outside the realm of economics.</i><br>
<p>
What could possibly be more important than happiness (except of course<br>
survival)? Wouldn't a life devoid of positive stimulation ("happiness") be<br>
utterly pointless? <br>
 <br>
As for the economic matter: automate to the max with as ultimate goal<br>
free-for-all production of anything, while reducing the population (a billion people<br>
<p>
is more than enough, and a tenth or a hundredth of that would be fine too). <br>
Quality over quantity. That's the *rational* course of action, anyway.<br>
