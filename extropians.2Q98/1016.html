This was intended as an example, and is not the only possible use by an<br>
SI of all the mass it can get. The example is by refrence to<br>
"Dragon's Egg", by Robert L. Forward, and is reall idle speculation<br>
on my part. Yes, you would start by squeezing everything into a<br>
neutron star. The idea is that the crust of the star would consist<br>
of matter that is almost, but not quite, compressed enough to<br>
form pure neutronium. This matter is assumed to exist as atomic matter<br>
with the electrons compressed almost into the nucleus, radically reducing<br>
the size of the atoms. You end up using most of the matter in the solar<br>
system as the core of the star, which is hard to use for computations.<br>
The crust is available to build the computer. The result is roughtly<br>
a thousand times denser that nanotech made from normal matter, so I guess<br>
it's picotech. It should operate at least one thousand times faster than<br>
nanotech because of reduced speed-of-light delays.<br>
<p>
If this is not feasible, the SI may still want to use ALL the matter<br>
in the solar system to maximize its computational capacity.<br>
