<p>
You don't get contradictions, but you do get paradoxes in the sense of<br>
things which are so contrary to intuition that you almost can't believe<br>
that they happen.<br>
<p>
There was an article in Extropy many years ago about electronic circuits<br>
which depended on time travel.  It looked like it would be possible to<br>
do significant amounts of computation in zero time.  You set up a system<br>
which will be inconsistent unless a certain equation is satisfied, and<br>
presto, the non-contradiction principle automatically means that the<br>
system satisfies the equation.<br>
<p>
Time travel computers would put quantum computers to shame.  Any NP<br>
problem (that is, any one whose answer can be checked easily, like<br>
factoring) can be solved in constant time.<br>
<p>
There is a classic sci-fi story in which (to simplify slightly) the<br>
man who will be known as the inventor of the time machine didn't invent<br>
it, he was given it by a future version of himself.  This would seemingly<br>
be consistent and has no contradictions, but it is paradoxical that<br>
a complex device like this would have no inventor.<br>
<p>
You also have to ask how the non-contradiction principle would prevent<br>
the actions of people who want to produce events in the past which are<br>
inconsistent with history.  Seemingly the universe must interpose some<br>
obstacles which will inevitably thwart their efforts.  The universe<br>
is forced in effect to act as a smart opponent, always coming up with<br>
something which defeats the clever tricks people try to use.<br>
