Theoretically, he could, but after doing so he wouldn't be Bill Gates<br>
anymore.  He wouldn't just have to have lots of money, he'd have to SPEND<br>
his money (all of it) in order to get that kind of power.<br>

<p>
Other PPAs.  If your PPA decides to get tyrannical, you decide to stop<br>
paying them for protection and instead pay another PPA (who will gladly<br>
accept your funds) to protect you against your current PPA.  If your<br>
current PPA is really being tyrannical, then lots of people will favor this<br>
strategy and the tyrannical PPA will be out of funding.  They may still try<br>
to wage war, and lose even more money, until eventually they'll be out of<br>
business.<br>
