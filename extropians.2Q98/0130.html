<i>        &gt;i would say nations are profit motivated, but the boundary between         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;profit  and power is not very clear cut.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
True. I can't draw a sharp line between a PPA and a nation, if a PPA was <br>
large enough and strong enough it might start to look a lot like a nation. <br>
I can't draw a sharp line between day and night either.<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Nations have a geographical location , PPA's do not. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Not by definition,</i><br>
           <br>
By my definition they do, otherwise it's not a PPA. <br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;but they would very probably become localised since weaponry is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;localised.</i><br>
<p>
I don't follow. <br>
1) ICBM's, H bombs, airplanes, anti aircraft guns, and even high power rifles  <br>
   are not localized.     <br>
   <br>
2) We have Private Protection Agencies today and not one of them has an  <br>
   exclusive territory.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's easy to change nations if they let you </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, it's no easy to change nations, even if they let you. You must find a new  <br>
job, a new house, a new school for your kids, you must learn a new culture,  <br>
a new language, and make new friends. Changing nations is something you do <br>
only if things have gotten so intolerable you are absolutely desperate, it's <br>
not like changing car insurance or your PPA because you think you might be <br>
able to get a 2% better deal someplace else.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it would not be easy to change PPAs if they didn't let you.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's as easy as reaching for the nearest telephone, and unless your PPA was  <br>
more powerful than all the others put together they would have to let you.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;PPA's settle differences with arbitration, Nations prefer force.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;most nations settle through negotiation, wars are rare.</i><br>
 <br>
<p>
Large asteroid impacts are rare too, but they're still important because when <br>
they do happen their effects are huge, however I wasn't just talking about <br>
external disputes with other nations, but the way it treats its own citizens. <br>
If government needs money they take it, if I  object to them stealing my <br>
property they will use force to get their booty, as much force as they need <br>
to, up to and including a bullet in my brain.  They will NOT take "no" for an <br>
answer, they'll make me an offer I can't refuse.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;arbitration (the more powerful PPA could select an arbiter closer to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;its likings).          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If I get into trouble I'd like my mother to be the arbiter, but unless I'm <br>
more powerful than everybody else I'm not going to get everything I want, and <br>
if I am that powerful then I don't need an arbiter at all, I'll just have <br>
everybody shot. As I said, the arbiter is paid by the case and is picked <br>
before the dispute and by BOTH parties bases on the arbiter's record.      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Wars only come when the sides don't agree on their relative strength,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;this happens with nations as well as with PPAs </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I never said violence would fall to zero, I did give my reasons for thinking <br>
the rate would be less than it is now with nation states.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>         &gt;&gt;Please explain to me how a PPA consisting of 40 million Germans        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;could murder 6 million Jews        </i><br>
         <br>
<i>         &gt;I'm sure the germans were spending more than 14% of their GDP on         </i><br>
<i>         &gt;their army, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Of course they were, and if I was there at the time I'd be giving the Nazi <br>
army money too, all I had, because they didn't have a PPA system so if I <br>
didn't pay they'd put a bullet in my brain.  Anti-Semitism was rampant in <br>
Germany, lots of people hated Jews, but I do not believe 40 million Germans,  <br>
or even 40 thousand, would voluntarily pay 14% of their gross income to kill <br>
Jews and keep doing so for years. I have no trouble believing that 6 million <br>
Jews would pay 14% of their income to stay alive, and a great deal more if <br>
needed.  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;there would be no need for all germans to join the same PPA, just         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the part that would count (ie the bit that has 80% or so of the       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;wealth)   You could probably do it with the top 1% of germany         </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
If you're talking about the top 1% then you're talking about the Jews, <br>
before Hitler Jews were the wealthiest segment of German society.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;If you're an Indian fisherman and you think that big bad Bill Gates         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;is out to get you and that your 10  million member PPA is too small         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;and weak to protect you, then join a bigger stronger one.                </i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;but you can't afford it.  A PPA would not take you if it thought you    </i><br>
<i>        &gt;would be more costly to keep than what you pay, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If 990 million other Indians can afford a PPA to protect them from Bill Gates  <br>
why can't I?<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it's very relevant how much the other PPA is extorting from you, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's even more relevant how many people this psychotic PPA is extorting <br>
because that's a measure of its total power. If the number was very large, <br>
much larger than any other PPA, then it would be very difficult to dislodge <br>
and might be close to world domination, but how did it get so big if it used <br>
such unpleasant tactics? I'm not saying it's impossible, maybe it could start<br>
as benign, offer great service and be much more efficiently operated than any <br>
other PPA and so charge lower rates, then when they had gotten far bigger and <br>
better than anybody else they suddenly send a memo to their many employees <br>
that there is a change in policy and we're going totalitarian, if anybody<br>
tries to leave our PPA shoot them. It could happen, but it's a hell of a lot <br>
more likely that the US Army will do it and take over the world. <br>
And that's not very likely.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;since how much you they will spend on keeping you depends on this         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;figure, and how much you will have to spend to fish the guy out        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;depends on that figure. why would you loose other customers?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You're saying that if the customers of my PPA are worth on average a thousand  <br>
dollars each to me then another PPA can use $1001 worth of force to steal a <br>
customer from me because it wouldn't be profitable for me to defend him.  <br>
Nonsense. If I did that all my customers would lose confidence in my PPA and <br>
I'd be out of business in a flash. It would be as if an insurance company <br>
never paid a claim to a customer higher than his premiums. As owner of a PPA <br>
I would be willing to pay not $1002 but millions of dollars, or however much <br>
it took, to stop that business calamity from happening.<br>
