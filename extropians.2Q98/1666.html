I agree that repeatability and transparency are a big part of science.<br>
<p>

<p>
I agree in regards to truth of any flavor.  I do think that one can't put any<br>
adjective before truth and mean what is commonly meant by truth -- which<br>
I take to be when an idea corresponds to existence.  Thus, "religious<br>
truths" and "mythical truths" are either oxymorons or metaphors or something<br>
other than a literal interpretation of the term would have you believe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Philosophic truth: beliefs, tenets of religions, political platforms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Impossible to cleanly define what the 'truth' is for any but a small group</i><br>

<i>&gt;Usefulness of this kind of truth is directly related to who you talk to..</i><br>
<p>
The problem here, of course, is that your view of scientific truth is a<br>
philosophy.  You believe certain truths are on firmer grounds than <br>
others and we should focus on these.  Is this not a philosophy?  It<br>
seeks to define and guide inquiry into what is true and even has<br>
a value system inherent in it.<br>
<p>
I do not think truth is completely separable into neat areas -- science,<br>
philosophy, politics, ect.  I think philosophy is basic beliefs.  By "basic<br>
beliefs," I mean stuff like the nature of existence and of knowledge.<br>
I consider these the What and the How of philosophy.  The nature<br>
of existence tells us, in general (because the sciences and history<br>
tell us specific facts) what is, while the nature of knowledge would<br>
give us methods of knowing as such (whether of general or specific<br>
facts).<br>
<p>
Does anyone agree with me here?<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
