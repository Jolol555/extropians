<p>
I'm puzzled here. At the end of your message you *do* in fact offer another<br>
definition. Clearly what you suggest is not an *explanation* as distinct<br>
from a definition, since explanations are longer than definitions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The above statement is quite good IMHO, but it might </i><br>
<i>&gt;not be the best possible response to give. The following are the </i><br>
<i>&gt;disadvantages I see:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. It's a little too long.</i><br>
<p>
For a definition, perhaps. My revised version is shorter (60% of the length<br>
of the original). For an *explanation* it would be too short, but I agree<br>
that for a definition, the shorter the better so long as it conveys the<br>
essence of the meaning.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. As Max suggests, evolution should be replaced with "development".</i><br>
<p>
I've done that in the new version.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3.  "the evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human </i><br>
<i>&gt;form" almost sounds as if it presupposes that intelligent life has </i><br>
<i>&gt;not already evolved beyond its currently human form. However, there </i><br>
<i>&gt;might be very advanced extraterrestrial species.</i><br>
<p>
True, though I think it's reasonable to assume people would understand the<br>
definition is referring to *us*. However, I've fixed that possible<br>
misconception in the revised version.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4. "life-promoting principles and values". I don't know anybody who </i><br>
<i>&gt;would say of his own values and principles that they are *not* </i><br>
<i>&gt;"life-promoting". It sounds like either empty rethoric or, worse, </i><br>
<i>&gt;like a commitment to the anti-abortion, anti-euthanesia stance.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not too comfortable with dropping this clause, since the ethical aspect<br>
I see as a vital part of transhumanism, but I do agree with your comment<br>
here. So I've dropped that clause, but would mention the ethical and<br>
psychological aspects of transhumanism in any explanation so that it<br>
doesn't sound like a narrow technological view.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;5. "by means of science and technology" could perhaps be misconstrued </i><br>
<i>&gt;in a too narrow sense.  Anders tends to stress that not only science </i><br>
<i>&gt;and technology, but also, e.g., psychological techniques and  </i><br>
<i>&gt;institution building, are part of the transhumanists' tool box. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Natasha might add that developing artistic creativity is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanist way of extending our minds and enriching our lives. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, its certainly important to include these approaches. The intent of the<br>
original was to make clear that we're talking about truly effective methods<br>
rather than religious or supernatural methods. In the revised version, I've<br>
taken into account both my original intention and your excellent point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That doesn't mean we can't try :-)  Building on Anders' version, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;suggest the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Transhumanism is the idea that the human condition will </i><br>
<i>&gt;be dramatically transformed by technology and that it is a good thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;to use rational methods to overcome our biological limitations."</i><br>
<p>
"the human condition will be dramatically transformed" won't do because it<br>
leaves open all kinds of tranformations that we certainly do not seek. Are<br>
we to transform ourselves into mindless drones? Into animals? Into<br>
creatures lacking the human drives to create, to understand, to learn? My<br>
definition avoids this problem.<br>
<p>
Okay, so here is my revised definition. I'll refine it further if anyone<br>
can pick holes in it! The final version will go in the Neologisms section<br>
of ExI's web site, and I'll also contact the editor who called me from the<br>
Oxford English Dictionary. (They are considering the terms "transhumanism"<br>
and "extropy" and "extropian" for the next revision of the OED.)<br>
<p>
TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life that seeks the acceleration of our<br>
development beyond its currently human limitations by means of science,<br>
technology, creativity, and other rational means.<br>

Onward!<br>
