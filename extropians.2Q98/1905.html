I was using an analogy; both of these philosophies are consequentialist,<br>
but you cannot construe utilitarianism to be egoism because of their<br>
important differences.  Using your notation, all of U must be in M in<br>
order to say that they are the same philosophy.  According to the thought<br>
experiment that I demonstrated, at least some of U is not in M, and<br>
therefore U is not M.<br>
<p>
As to whether the intersection of M and non-aggression (NA) is entirely<br>
within U, we have another thought experiment, this one orginally from<br>
David Friedman.  Suppose you had a madman on the loose, who will kill<br>
hundreds of people unless you shoot him immediately.  Unfortunately, you<br>
do not own a gun; but MY gun could be easily stolen and used to save the<br>
people.  I am not aruond, but I have mde it explicitly clear that I want<br>
no one to use my gun no matter how important the cause. <br>
<p>
Utilitarianism will steal the gun and save the people, then repay the gun<br>
owner in whatever way possible; M U NA would not aggress against the gun<br>
owner.<br>
