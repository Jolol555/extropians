Massive parallelism, "configurable computing", superconductors, reversable<br>
computing.<br>
<p>
The only new item in this list is "configurable computing." This is the<br>
most recent buzz phrase making the rounds of the chip designers. The idea<br>
is to make on-the-fly changes to the programs of the progammable logic that<br>
make up a portin of the computer, either to alter the instruction set or to<br>
alter the interconnectivity of various computing elements.<br>
<p>
Strictly speaking, Moore's law was originally stated in terms of memory density,<br>
but it's used as a proxy for transistor density, which in turn drives<br>
computing complexity and speed. My list of workarounds is actually for computing power,<br>
not memory density. For memory density, just use nanotech to store one bit<br>
per hundred atoms or so, in three dimensions. This keeps Moore's law of memory<br>
density going to about 2030, I think.<br>
