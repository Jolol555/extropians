<i>&gt; I think you're trying to hold advocates of Anarchy to an impossibly high </i><br>

<i>&gt; world. Well I can't do that, but I think I can show that there would be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom, far fewer victimless crimes, and no murders committed on an  </i><br>
<i>&gt; industrial scale that we're all too familiar with.. Instead of dreaming up </i><br>
<i>&gt; bizarre and unlikely scenarios involving murderous billionaires ask yourself  </i><br>
<i>&gt; how the holocaust or the inquisition could have possibly occurred in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; world I describe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'm not trying to hold anarchists to anything.  I consider myself<br>
an anarchist, in the more traditional use of the word<br>
(anarcho-socialists).  I was just pointing out the, what i think are,<br>
extensive simmilarities between the current system and PPA based<br>
anarcho-capitalism as you described it, and the big power that one man<br>
could wield over a large part of the population in this supposedly<br>
decentralised system.  The holocaust or the inquisition could just as well<br>
happen as with the current nation-states, the main difference being that<br>
the new megalomaniac's great quality would be having heaps of property.  I<br>
don't see the case i described of bill gates or some other billionaire of<br>
trying to wipe a part of the population as any more far-fetched than that<br>
of some german thinking that jews are evil and trying to wipe off that<br>
portionof the population.  Great wealth is not a certificate of sanity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, last time I checked there were close to a billion Indians not </i><br>
<i>&gt; 10 million</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
huh?  what's that got to do with the price of fish?  I wasn't trying to<br>
say that bill gates wanted to wipe India off the planet, just that some<br>
person with wealth y would want to do something disagreeable to  x people<br>
with income z, where x is very large but y &gt; x*z, and him/her being able<br>
to do this rather easily under the proposed system.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;i don't see any PPA supporting the poor people since they have         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;nothing to gain from this, apart from forced labor and slavery.</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this sort of thing bothers you then pick a PPA that does a lot of charity </i><br>
<i>&gt; work. Of course if nobody wants to help these people then they're in deep </i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble, but no worse than today. If you won't voluntarily help the poor why </i><br>
<i>&gt; would you vote for a politician who makes you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
i am not going to support a democratic system in this argument since i<br>
have very little sympathy for such a system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Doing business with a PPA is voluntary as long as that PPA lets it         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;be a voluntary thing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A nation has a geographical area, so changing nations is nothing you can do  </i><br>
<i>&gt; lightly as it will change every aspect of your life. A PPA on the other hand </i><br>
<i>&gt; has no geographical area, changing a PPA would be like changing your car </i><br>
<i>&gt; insurance, you just pick up a telephone. A PPA that tried to prevent people </i><br>
<i>&gt; from changing would have to go to war with all the other PPA's, for reasons I</i><br>
<i>&gt; explained earlier it's unlikely it would win.</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
And for reasons i explained earlier it is very likely it WOULD win, or<br>
more likely, that no war would occur, <br>
or that if there was a war and it didn't then you wouldn't come out any<br>
better. i've already stated it twice.  check my response to Dan Fabulich's<br>
posts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;people who enjoy making money. Those kind of people are much safer         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;to  have in positions of power.        </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;i would say that is exactly the kind of people that are in a        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;position of power right now. How many dictators are poor after their         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;time in  government?</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's meaningless to ask how much money Stalin had, his face was on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; currency for goodness sake, he could have anything and everything that it was </i><br>
<i>&gt; possible for the USSR to produce. Making money is a good and noble activity </i><br>
<i>&gt; and the idea that Bill Gates had more power over peoples lives than Stalin </i><br>
<i>&gt; is crazy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
i didn't claim that.  Stalin is not exactly the average guy in a position<br>
of power right now.  That Bill Gates under PPA anarcho-capitalism (PPAAC?)<br>
would have more influence than John Howard (Australia's PM, just in case)<br>
has right now, i would say most definitely.<br>
