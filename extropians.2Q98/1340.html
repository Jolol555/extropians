The rhetorical teleology with which John poses his taunt might be a clue to<br>
the answer.  (Or might not.)  Evolution, as he knows perfectly well, isn't<br>
the kind of process that can `bother' about anything.  Gravity doesn't<br>
bother to make things fall down and so when things pile up at the foot of<br>
the mountain it's not because of any advance scheme.  <br>
<p>
I assume that `sentience' means `consciousness' in this context, although,<br>
as has been noted before, it really just denotes any ability to register<br>
sensations, which snails have despite their gross stupidity  and Zen<br>
egoless-ness.  So it could be that reflexive self-awareness is an<br>
incidental computational by-product of very complex brained bodies<br>
responding in complex ways (understanding, assessing, planning etc) to a<br>
complex environment - rather as the red colour of blood is an accidental<br>
by-product of what it's made out of, and without any teleological merits.<br>
(On the other hand, our perhaps hard-wired fearful reaction to the sight of<br>
blood gushing is surely a selected or easily instilled tropism that depends<br>
on the quantum physics of hemoglobin.)<br>
<p>
John's answer to this suggestion, I guess, would be that natural genomic<br>
variations might by now have allowed the emergence of a sub-class of<br>
non-conscious humans (zombies) if sentience in this sense is just an<br>
unimportant side-consequence.  Probably so.  Hence, it seems plausible that<br>
to be something of which we can say `there is something it is like to be<br>
that' - sorry for the contorted philosopherese - is *not* a meaningless<br>
happenstance, but resulted from benefits that consciousness provided to the<br>
animals with it (in varying degrees).  In a way what I just wrote is<br>
compatible with John's comment about evolution bothering to make humans<br>
conscious, but my skin itches horribly when I see informed comments cast in<br>
this dangerously misleading shape.<br>
