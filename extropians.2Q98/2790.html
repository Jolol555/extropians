<i>&gt; &gt;As we develop more and more powerful technologies which are more and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;efficient in their potential to be used to interfere or restrain the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;individual's rights, the threat of government overreaching becomes even more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;amplified, and by neccessity, will force the body of individuals to elect to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;discontinue that outmoded practice.</i><br>
<p>
do you mean to discontinue the outmoded practice of using privacy-violating<br>
technology?  do we then develop communications technology that is<br>
encoded for privacy?  ok, i see, but i am still interested in the notion<br>
of hiding in plain sight.  i want to go ahead and offer the government<br>
the ability to track me down with little or no effort, then downsize the<br>
government to compensate for this convenience i am handing over<br>
to it.<br>
<p>
in fact, i want to become the government in a sense.  i have no<br>
desire to control anyone.  i want to *create* something that would<br>
cause people to come to me or us, voluntarily, to join, to plug in<br>
to the superorganism and evolve to the next plateau...  spike<br>
