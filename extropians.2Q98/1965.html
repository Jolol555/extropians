I appreciate the kind words Dan.<br>
<p>
Yup...in a manner of speaking I was.  Several things prompted that line of<br>
thought.  What I mentioned regarding elephants (which I'm not positive is<br>
true)...as well as an article I vaugely recall in popular science some time<br>
back.<br>
<p>
It seems that a computer model was run on good ole T-Rex.  The results implied<br>
that T-Rex was more of a walker than a runner....primarily because if he got<br>
to moving too fast...and tripped...it would be fatal.  Falling down would snap<br>
his neck like a dry twig.<br>
<p>
So it appears that T-Rex might have been more of a buzzard than anything<br>
else...<br>
<p>
And I was wondering if any other similar interesting info was known?<br>
<p>
And sure enough Micheal Lowery comes thru.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;The reason why dinosaurs that we know</i><br>
popularly (most were actually quite small) are so big is that they developed<br>
at<br>
a time when all or most of the continents were part of the Pangea super<br>
continent. Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between the<br>
evolved sizes of animals and the size of the land mass which they inhabit.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
So that explains it..."Range Size"...<br>
<p>
Small countinents don't have enough grub for really BIG critters...  <br>
<p>
Thanx.<br>
