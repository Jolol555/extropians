Although I'm a positive atheist, and sometimes very radical, I do understand<br>
religious, since, by birth and tradition, I have been one of them. The<br>
emotional appeals associated to religions are very strong... They smartly<br>
use figures associated with mother, father, brother, family, goodness,<br>
charity, suffering etc etc ... I, in particular, followed this logical path:<br>
<p>
1st: I verified some incoherecies on Jesus behaviour, enough for begining my<br>
questioning on his idoneity as the "son of god"... and made myself FREE from<br>
FAITH ( necessary, since not even a scientific mind is enough to break the<br>
FAITH... In the beginning, I even thought that Pope, Church, Lutter,<br>
Protestants etc simply MISUNDERSTOOD Jesus's message... who was right...<br>
obviously I never believed that a god had created all this almost<br>
yesterday... I was religious not idiot...). I will give you a small example,<br>
of Jesus actuation: If you read his story with a deeper attention, you will<br>
see that one of main subjects threated on it is the supposed Victory of him<br>
over the Death. But It was simply really dieing and believing he would<br>
ressurrect... for that disciples hide his body... The main problem is: He<br>
calls the disciples to follow him and face the death in prol of FAITH and<br>
GLORY of God... The Ignorant Plebes , for other side, "the support of<br>
FAITH", "The rock on wich the Church would be constructed" ( the illuded<br>
brains of such people so...)  would never be told this conclusions directly,<br>
an would have to deduce it by themselves... "Lots are called by little are<br>
chosen". One of the mission of the priests is to keep themselves firmly on<br>
the conduction of the "shepheards" and do not cause "scandals" to the<br>
families and innocents... But some monks and religious not: Just read the<br>
lifes of the so-called saints: They simply wish strongly "To go together<br>
with The Lord" and lots, lots of them simply starved until death... Lots of<br>
martyres where so by their own choices and not obliged or killed like other<br>
of them ... They WANTED to die because of their LOVE to Jesus... They wanted<br>
TO SUFFER like him... You do not read... you do not really know...<br>
Jesus and lots of their saints were "suicides of god" ... And: Church<br>
publicly denies this and... forgimme, but protestants know nothing about<br>
this, they are just an independent interpretation of the words of Jesus,<br>
with a lot of good intentions and happiness and songs, but just 500 years<br>
old, while whole chistianism comes since 2000 ys ago...<br>
<p>
2nd: Supposing science will one day ressurrect people from the past...<br>
Jesus, Budha, Mahomet etc will be ressurrected by science and all this lie<br>
will simply finish...<br>
<p>
3rd: My last doubt was about god's existence, since up to then, I had simply<br>
convinced myself that Jesus was not god...: But, IMHO, I see that the<br>
problem is in our linear logic, oriented to a subject-object interpretation<br>
of the actions... If there is an universe, it was created, if it was created<br>
there is a creator... A simple logic conclusion got when men still were<br>
afraid of thunderbolts... Instead, if we think the universe as the whole set<br>
of all, including its transformations, any phenomenum may be explained as<br>
just a self-relashionship of the universe itself... And so there is no need<br>
of using the famous (and false) pair creator-creation... even before the<br>
last, but possibly not the only, big-bang...<br>
<p>
<p>
Enough for while...<br>
