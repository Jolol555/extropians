<i>&gt;At any rate, I think that any system based on </i><br>

<p>
I understand and agree.<br>
<p>
As an interesting side note, a few weeks back, ABC did a<br>
special with John Stossel on greed -- of all things.  In this<br>
expose, Stossel found a for profit life guard company that<br>
was beating the pants off the Red Cross in South Florida.<br>
The for profit life guard company was more innovative in<br>
life saving and management techniques.<br>
<p>
The illustration was driven home when they spyed on a<br>
Red Cross life guard, who was busy grilling burgers, while<br>
the private firm's employees were required to watch the<br>
pool the whole time.  (The manager randomly checks<br>
them to make sure and immediately fires anyone who is<br>
not doing her/his job.)<br>
<p>
To make this case even stronger, the private company<br>
costs more to hire, yet more and more pools are hiring<br>
its life guards over cheaper Red Cross ones.  Which<br>
life guards would you rather have if your kids were in<br>
the water?<br>
