<p>
         I dont' support 'by far the largest concentration of power, the <br>
         State.'  I work unceasingly to find ways to reduce and fragment <br>
         that power, and to have the State (or State-like entities) <br>
         oppressing people as little as possible, while working to enhance <br>
         their freedom.  In Democratic Agorism, Representatives in the <br>
         (fully marketized, note) Agora Assembly need not elect a leader, <br>
         and may pass no laws at at all unless a clear majority of <br>
         Electors want otherwise.  Even then, laws have to get past the <br>
         Constitution and _juries_.  It's damnably hard if not impossible <br>
         to 'concentrate power' in such circumstances.<br>
         <br>
         And I'm not unsympathetic to the anarchist project (an Eric Frank <br>
         Russell fan writes) _if_ anarchist theoreticians can come up with <br>
         proven viable ways of organizing a society which optimizes <br>
         individual liberty, and is _reversible_ as and when it goes wrong.<br>

<i>&gt; You may not like Microsoft</i><br>
<p>
         'Microsoft' is an 'artificial person.'  I don't like the way <br>
         MS-DOS was ripped-off from Gary Kildall's brilliant CP/M (oddly, <br>
         I had a fully disassembled and commented copy of disassembld CP/M <br>
         source code early on at that time.  It could have been me! ).<br>
         <br>
         IBM at that time wanted a crippled version of CP/M for their <br>
         crippled 'Personal Computer' (absurd overpriced Intel 8085-based <br>
         thing) -- they didn't want personal computing to succeeed, <br>
         remember, partly for economic reasons (to preserve mini and <br>
         mainframe sales) and partly for social and political reasons.<br>
         <br>
         The Microsoft empire is founded on that looted, sad and dishonest <br>
         MS-DOS thing; the difference being, that Kildall and Digital <br>
         Research knew how to create reliable, compact fast operating <br>
         systems, and transport them to other platforms.  I'm using <br>
         CPM/68K and GEM right here and now on an Atari Falcon, and I <br>
         won't be changing any time soon.<br>
<p>
         I also enjoy reading the indicators for the Feds' (or others') <br>
         sporadic if clumsy efforts to access my Hard Drive and files <br>
         while I'm online.  Whereas a Microsoft system opens the backdoors <br>
         invisibly for them, so the Feds can pluck your PGP keys straight <br>
         off the keyrings... &lt;shudder&gt;...<br>
         <br>
<i>&gt; but it never put millions of people into ovens, only nations do that.         </i><br>
<p>
        As we have  discussed, the Nazi Labour Camps program is an early <br>
        version of 'Workfare' -- putting the 'idle' to work, for the good <br>
        of society, natch.  Every time a bureacrat dreamed up a new public <br>
        works project, they rounded up more prisoners.  And they rented <br>
        prisoners out to private businesses as cheap labour, which created <br>
        an inexhaustable demand for more prisoners.  Killing them all was <br>
        Mueller's contribution to hitting the Nazis' war production. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;If you fondly imagine that the USA's economic system rewards hard         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;work </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hard word is irrelevant, it's not rewarded nor should it be.</i><br>
<p>
         A crucial concession. Thank you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's smart work that's rewarded.      </i><br>
<p>
        How many examples do you need, to concede the falsehood of _that_ <br>
        proposition also?<br>
<p>
        <br>
        The market doesn't 'reward' _anything_, except if you call people <br>
        impersonally following abstract price signals a matter for <br>
        'reward.'<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;ask yourself why, in the US, there is a near-perfect _inverse ratio</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;between how arduous and unpleasant the work is, and how much you get         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;paid for doing it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't believe there is such a ratio. An off shore oil worker, a boxer, </i><br>
<i>&gt; an ironworker, a bridge rigger, even a coal miner are all very dangerous jobs, </i><br>
<i>&gt; many think they're unpleasant too, yet they're well paid. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
         I said 'near-perfect', not 'perfect.'  How much does a toilet <br>
         cleaner, say, earn in your locality?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you define an anarcho capitalist as somebody who engages in anarcho </i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalistic actions then that particular creature is as mythical as a  </i><br>
<i>&gt; unicorn, states do not allow people to be anarcho capitalists, yet.</i><br>
<p>
         It's not that States do not allow people to be anarcho-capitalist <br>
         (look at the New York kid who can't even pull down minimum wage <br>
         dealing dope on the street); in James Buchanan's apt phrase, 'we <br>
         never get out of anarchy.' Since the prevailing social controls <br>
         in an anarcho-capitalist society (if such a beast were even <br>
         possible) are totally arbitrary, and can be _anything_ it's hard <br>
         to know what the complaint is.<br>
         <br>
         If you view States as strata title landholding companies, as landowners <br>
         they're entitled under _anarcho-capitalism_ to set whatever rules <br>
         of social conduct they damn well please.  You don't like it? <br>
         So move.<br>
         <br>
<i>&gt; Just  having such opinions does not seem to be detrimental to ones economic </i><br>
<i>&gt; health,  I have a dollar or two.</i><br>
<p>

<i>&gt;        &gt;Randians would advise talented people to make as _little_ as        </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;possible, so as to withold resources from the looter State.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not a Randian. I finely got around to reading "Atlas Shrugged" about  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2 months ago so. It was nice.</i><br>
<p>
         I had a business and a dollar or three when first I read 'atlas <br>
         Shrugged' in 1972 or 1973.  My older brother said: "Here's a good <br>
         book about railroads."  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
         I'd be genuinely interested in learning how you adjust to Rand's <br>
         injunction to minimize your output.  I had real heartbreak <br>
         wrestling with the issue.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;        &gt;it is within our power to save the lives of children in Ethiopia      </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes.</i><br>
               <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;we simply choose _not to_,    </i><br>
               <br>
<i>&gt; Yes.</i><br>
<p>
        Don't you see _any_ moral problem here?  Is human life worthless <br>
        to you?<br>
        <br>
<i>&gt; I'm not going to do that, or anything close to it, I very much doubt you </i><br>
<i>&gt; are either. The human species is only capable of a finite amount of altruism,</i><br>
<p>
      I spend time and effort working on enhanced small-scale market <br>
      systems which they can make use of directly and locally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; that's why communism didn't work</i><br>
<p>
       I don't think 'communism' (whatever that may be) can possibly work <br>
       (the 'economic calculation' argument of Mises etc.).  The average <br>
       Russian seems to be worse off under Crony-Capitalism now than under <br>
       Gorby's regime -- life expectancy back to Stalin-era levels.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Instead of whining about something you're never going to change, try </i><br>
<i>&gt; finding a system that can turn the selfishness that everybody has into</i><br>
<i>&gt; a virtue.</i><br>

    If I could offer a free operating system better than Windoze (and I <br>
    can) I could never get it onto the market on any large scale.  The US <br>
    state would simply act to block it.  A global Windoze monopoly is too <br>
    useful to them, for reasons already given here.  There is no 'free <br>
    market' in strategic commodities.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; Is it better for one leader to controls everything?</i><br>
<p>
          Democratic Agorism does not require a 'leader.'  Horizontal <br>
          reticular systems don't.  Vertical ('Capitalist') systems do.  <br>
          You seem unable to understand the distinction.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tony, near as I can tell your main complaint against Anarcho Capitalism </i><br>
<i>&gt; is that it's not as good as a nation state where the leaders always do </i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly what Tony Hollick wants, perhaps so, but that's not really the </i><br>
<i>&gt; choice we face now is it.</i><br>
<p>
     Truly, John, not so.  I worked for years trying to find ways to make <br>
     anarchism work.  I never found a way, is all.<br>
     <br>
     My standard 'toolkit' is Rawlsian:<br>
     <br>
     [1] The Original Position (choosing a system 'from scratch');<br>
     <br>
     [2] The 'Veil of Ignorance' (choosing a system without knowing one's <br>
     own characteristics within the system, so that you accept _any_ <br>
     position you find yourself in within the society you choose, whatever <br>
     your personal attributes of strength, intelligence etc.)<br>
     <br>
     All this you find in John Rawls, 'A Theory of Justice.'<br>
     <br>
     Probably the easiest lead-in is Robert Nozick's 'Anarchy, State and <br>
     Utopia', an immensely readable book which covers the field from <br>
     'state-of-nature' through anarchy to minimal states.<br>
