Sorry, I haven't been following this debate for long, so excuse me if I'm<br>
rehashing old points.<br>
<p>
You cannot give the government extra abilities while downsizing the<br>
government.  The two are mutually exclusive.<br>
<p>
It is a common belief in democracies that we can make the government do<br>
what we want it to.  People think that if the majority wants a government<br>
which will have tremendous powers but not abuse them, then that's the<br>
government we'll get.  This seems reasonable on some level; common sense<br>
dictates that if the majority wants something to happen, it will happen,<br>
because people vote. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, this sort of evaluation is faulty in a representative<br>
democracy.  Even imagining that we could convince the majority to agree<br>
with our political philosophy, this would in no way guarantee that the<br>
government would actually change.  It will always be more profitable in<br>
the short term to lobby a politician for special interests than it will be<br>
to research the issues and choose the best candidate.  And if you're the<br>
politician, there's nothing stopping you from saying "OK.  You want a<br>
special tax break for unions/industry/Internet commerce?  I want expanded<br>
powers.  [Remember, the more powers a politician has, the more he/she has<br>
available to sell!] If you support my power grab, I'll get you your tax<br>
break." <br>
<p>
In short, nothing you can do or say can prevent a politican from abusing<br>
his/her powers, even if the majority is opposed to the idea.  The only way<br>
to prevent this is by actually preventing the government from doing its<br>
job: by making it more inefficient, by creating a system by which it is<br>
hard to pass laws, and ultimately by eschewing government entirely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; in fact, i want to become the government in a sense.  i have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; desire to control anyone.  i want to *create* something that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause people to come to me or us, voluntarily, to join, to plug in</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the superorganism and evolve to the next plateau...  spike</i><br>
<p>
Then you want anarcho-capitalism, *not* government.  The government forces<br>
people to join.  If you want something voluntary, then go create a private<br>
institution.<br>
