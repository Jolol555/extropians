TH&gt; I don't know how 'self-ownership' can be made to work without some kind<br>
TH&gt; of methodological dualism (a 'self' to own the body).  I have no problem<br>
TH&gt; with methodological dualism -- I'm an interactionist dualist; but I<br>
TH&gt; notice quite a few people hereabouts who are monists -- they believe the<br>
TH&gt; self is identified with the atoms and molecules of the physical being.<br>
<p>
Am I reading you correctly?  That sounds like an odd thing for extropians to<br>
believe.  (Although, I have certainly heard stranger.)  If you accept the<br>
concept of uploading in any form, it's based on an assumption that the person<br>
is software -- a pattern of information.  So, you can move this software from<br>
one hardware "platform" to another, and it's still valid.<br>
<p>
TH&gt; Even if we go with dualism, it is far from clear how an infant acquires <br>
TH&gt; self-ownership from its parents -- who provided the initial and necessary<br>
TH&gt; material basis for the new person in the form of sperm and ovum.   Are we<br>
TH&gt; to say that the person is wholly owned by their biological parents unless<br>
TH&gt; or until some form of manumission takes place).<br>
<p>
I certainly wouldn't say that.  It's a gradual shift, as the child grows and<br>
becomes more and more responsible for his own person and well-being.<br>
<p>
One amusing aspect is that current law assumes the whole process works on a<br>
fixed 21-year time schedule, as driven by human biology.  What happens if<br>
someone designs a child that will never grow up?  Is is morally wrong to do<br>
such a thing?  Or what about the opposite, someone creating a new person fully<br>
formed and ready to enter life as an adult, like Minerva springing from Jove's<br>
forehead?<br>
<p>
TH&gt; Then there's the problem of title to ingested resources as the person <br>
TH&gt; grows -- does this give another whose (claimed) resources are consumed a <br>
TH&gt; literal right to their 'pound of flesh'?<br>
<p>
If you're raising a kid, that's an investment in your own reproduction<br>
imperative.  Your payback is the success of your offspring, carrying your<br>
genes into the future.<br>
<p>
TH&gt; There is a real problem with ingesting living organisms (or  their  body <br>
TH&gt; parts) -- do they not also enjoy degrees of self-ownership?<br>
<p>
No, they don't.  They would have to be sentient persons in order to OWN<br>
anything, including their own bodies.<br>
