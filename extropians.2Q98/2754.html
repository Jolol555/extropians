Apparently the founders of New Utopia are of the opinion that 100<br>
miles from the nearest country  is the pertinent distance.<br>
Appended belwo is a letter taken from the New Utopia website that is<br>

<p>
A Letter To<br>
The Secretary General<br>
Of The United Nations<br>
Concerning NEW UTOPIA<br>
<p>

<p>
Mr. Kofi Annan<br>
Secretary General <br>
United Nations<br>
New York, NY 10017 <br>
<p>
June 9, 1997 <br>
<p>
Dear Mr. Secretary, <br>
<p>
Please consider this letter a formal request to begin the process of<br>
application for The Principality of New Utopia to join The United<br>
Nations. New Utopia, a constitutional monarchy, has existed since<br>
September of 1996, and has 314 citizens at this time, but we look<br>
forward to having many more join us in the very near future. <br>
<p>
New Utopia is a new country in the Caribbean. It is comprised of three<br>
submerged islands on which will be constructed large platforms forming<br>
a base upon which to build the newest most beautiful city/state in the<br>
world. <br>
<p>
We claim as our national territory the area of the Caribbean bound on<br>
the north by 19 degrees 15 minutes North Latitude (19.25 degrees North<br>
Lat.), the southern boundary located at 18 degrees 15 minutes North<br>
Latitude (18.25 degrees North Lat.). The eastern boundary being 83<br>
degrees 30 minutes West Longitude (83.5 degrees West Long.) and the<br>
western boundary at 84 degrees 30 minutes West Longitude (84.5 degrees<br>
Long.). <br>
<p>
Our new country is not within 100 miles of any other nation's <br>
                                        ***********************<br>
boundaries, therefore we beg the United Nations for their support and<br>
protection, while we are in the crucial development and construction<br>
phase of our new country, which is to begin in April 1998. <br>
<p>
We have studied the Convention on the Law of the Sea as of 16 November<br>
1994; the Rio Declaration, and Agenda 21, all of which are in keeping<br>
with the philosophies and Constitution of New Utopia. <br>
<p>
We pledge to support and assist in every way possible the United<br>
Nations and all other member nations. <br>
<p>
Sincerely, <br>
<p>
(signed)<br>
Richard Stephen Balch<br>
Secretary of State <br>
