Subject: Bulworth<br>
<p>
Bulworth and the Socialist Critique of Capitalism<br>
<p>
I thoroughly enjoyed *Bulworth*.  Warren Beatty portrays a California<br>
Senator who breaks down and becomes honest again.  Beatty's Bulworth is a<br>
refreshing alternative to our real politicians who talk to and from nothing<br>
but big money.  (One woman asks Bulworth, paraphrased, "Why haven't we<br>
received the Federal Aid you promised us?"  He responds, "Well, you haven't<br>
really contributed to my campaign, have you?")  Bulworth realizes he's been<br>
a sell-out, and then  he fights to make a change.<br>
<p>
Beatty is on the rampage here.  He is subverting the entire<br>
Democrat-Republican cooperative, and challenging us to stop prostituting<br>
principles.  This, I love.  (Oh, and the plot and characters are developed<br>
fully and interestingly.)<br>
<p>
What I love rather less are the particular principles for which Beatty<br>
fights.  He explicitly calls for "socialized medicine" (at least he has the<br>
balls "to call a spade a spade"), private subsidization of insurance for<br>
the poor, and a myriad of other socialist programs.  What I don't get is<br>
that, while Beatty recognizes that "politicians have f**ked up public<br>
education," he expects them to expand public education, government<br>
medicine, and government on all levels.<br>
<p>
As Murray Rothbard and others have long-recognized, the radical left and<br>
radical right share a number of similarities.  We both call for radical<br>
cultural changes, we both believe that the current system is corrupt in its<br>
power, we both denounce Democrats and Republicans.  Where we differ is in<br>
our interpretation of corruption.  We libertarians think that the<br>
government is responsible for the current problems in medicine, education,<br>
and so forth.  Socialists such as Beatty think that big business is the<br>
source of corrupt power.  Hence, our political agendas are the precise<br>
opposite.  Libertarians call for the radical cutback of government so that<br>
the private sector can fulfill human needs; socialists call for the radical<br>
increase of government so that the government can fulfill human needs.  We<br>
agree only that the current nexus of government and big business is evil;<br>
libertarians think that government is the fundamental corruptive force<br>
while socialists think that big business is.  Perhaps this is the root of<br>
Mises' theory that one system will ultimately drive out the other.<br>
<p>
Largely our disagreements are an empirical matter which can be resolved by<br>
open-minded discussion and research.  (*Can* be, not *will* be.)  I think<br>
that Beatty errs on two counts - first, that big business is inherently<br>
corruptive and that the free sector is incapable of providing just, honest<br>
business, and second, that the private sector is incapable of providing<br>
charity, quality health care, and so forth.<br>
<p>
See Bulworth for two reasons.  In the abstract, Bulworth represents a<br>
dedication to Principle.  We can be inspired by Beatty's devotion even as<br>
we are repelled by the particular content of his principles.  The second<br>
reason to see Bulworth is to get a better idea of where the socialists in<br>
America are coming from - what they believe and what they advocate.  I<br>
actually agree with a lot of what Bulworth says.  Bulworth and Pat Buchanan<br>
share some notable beliefs that I dismiss.  If the libertarians are<br>
supposed to contain "the party of principle," I'd say that Beatty and<br>
others are trying to restore that title to the Democratic Party.  The<br>
Republicans obviously are ideologically bankrupt; if the Democrats find<br>
their moral voice, then we are in for some major shifts in favor of<br>
government power.  That is unless, of course, we are able to manifest a<br>
fervor and eloquence in support of *our* principles to match that of Beatty<br>
and the other Democrats-of-Spine.<br>
