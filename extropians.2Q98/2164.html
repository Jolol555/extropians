I like it, very good point.<br>

             <br>
<p>
The observations are certainly true and they are consistent in the sense that <br>
they are repeatable, but they are not consistent with the way our everyday <br>
macro world seems to operate nor are they consistent with the classical laws <br>
of logic as Aristotle understood them.<br>

<p>
I don't know and I very much doubt that a clear unambiguous non circular  <br>
answer to that question exists. In other words the answer would be fuzzy.<br>
             <br>

<i>         &gt;Reality is reality.</i><br>
            <br>
And fuzzy is fuzzy.<br>

<i>        &gt;The fuzziness lies in the mismatch between concepts and the physical         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reality.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Like an exasperated parent trying to answer the questions of a very <br>
intelligent but overly curious child, nature tells us that it's foolish to <br>
ask if an atom went through one slot or two, but it can't tell us exactly why <br>
it's foolish. I think if the question really is silly it's because even <br>
nature doesn't know the answer.<br>

<i>        &gt;If the photon goes through both slits, that is 100% true.</i><br>
             <br>
<p>
Saying the particle went through both slits is no better than any of the <br>
other 3 possible answers. One quality truth is supposed to have is <br>
immutability, yet I can change what was true. Even though the photon passed <br>
the barrier with the slots in it 10 years ago I can manipulate the truth <br>
about what happened then and I can to it right now, it all depends on how I<br>
set up my detecting  equipment. I can make whatever you want to be "true" <br>
10 years ago. If you want me to make it true that a photon went through one <br>
slit or both slits back in 1988 just tell me which you prefer and I'll make <br>
it happen.<br>
