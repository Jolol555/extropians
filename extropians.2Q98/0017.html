<p>
My point was I never claimed to be speaking about secular humanism,<br>
but about secular humanists I met.  Since I qualified my statements, only<br>
a sloppy reading would mischaraterize my assertion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I was just pointing out that your comment</i><br>
<i>&gt;was not a fair way to characterize humanism.</i><br>
<p>
To reiterate:<br>
<p>
 "I've also noticed that many people who call themselves "secular<br>
 humanist" are really just using the term as a euphemism for<br>
 "atheist.""<br>
<p>
I was observing how people I've met who call themselves secular humanists<br>
use the term.  I qualified my statement in such a way that only someone<br>
with an axe to grind would have mistaken it.  I took no stand on humanISM<br>
or secular humanISM.  I was discussing secular humanISTS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You should try some</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientific method which does not allow one to use such "personal" off</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cuff observations as evidence to support claims. Have you ever heard</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the science method?</i><br>
<p>
Problem is: I did not and do not claim my "off the cuff observations" are<br>
somehow the height of data collection.  In fact, I made no claims that I<br>
could not support.  Nor did I maintain that my experience is somehow<br>
priviliged or universalizeable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course you have. Just as I can read. I was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;jumping on your back, why did you feel it necessary to stomp on mine?</i><br>
<p>
Because you misread me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You just were making it sound like Secular Humanism was philosophically</i><br>
<i>&gt;a "weak straw man" which is identical to atheism.</i><br>
<p>
I made and make no claim about secular humanism as a philosophy.  I<br>
was making claims about secular humanists -- not ideas but people.  I've<br>
met a few and when we got to discussing our beliefs, it seemed to me<br>
that most had atheism as their only binding belief -- the thing they had in<br>
common, that they all could agree on.  Some did share other things, such<br>
as a basically JudeoChristian ethical system.<br>
<p>
I'm not claiming that secular humanism implies this, though if secular<br>
humanism owes anything to humanism as it has come down through<br>
the centuries, then one might expect it to be JudeoChristian ethically<br>
and Leftist politically.  This is because few movements have outright<br>
rejected JudeoChristian ethics -- even Marxists are animated by them<br>
-- and humanism is generally has always been more toward the Left<br>
end of the political spectrum.<br>
<p>
For the record, these are just my observations.  I've not done nor do<br>
I claim to have done extensive research or randomly surveyed<br>
secular humanists.  The thing to do here, if anyone cares, would be<br>
to do a survey of alleged secular humanists and examine the<br>
major and influential works of secular humanism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This would not be a be</i><br>
<i>&gt;a far criticism. It is like then people characterize transhumanism as</i><br>
<i>&gt;science fiction that is confused about reality. </i><br>
<p>
Again, my claim was about secular humanISTS NOT secular humanISM.<br>
I think I have a little understanding of transhumanISM, but it would not be<br>
wrong to examine and post observations about transhumanISTS, as long<br>
as others and me did not confuse the two.  Do you see the difference?<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
