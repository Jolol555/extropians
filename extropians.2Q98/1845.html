I suppose one could solve the vagueness of blue by assigning it a strict <br>
definition.  Blue is light with a wavelength of 550 nm. Given such a <br>
definition, the truth value of the statement 'le ciel est bleu' must be <br>
no, as the value will be something other than precisely 550 nm, and will <br>
fluctuate across the horizon and from second to second as light is <br>
marginally refracted by water vapor and other chemicals inthe <br>
atmosphere.  The only way to get a true Trotskian statement on sky color <br>
is to limit sky to a particular point in the sky to a particular point <br>
in time and find the precise wavelength.  In practice this will not be <br>
very useful, because nobody says things like, 'le ciel est bleu at a <br>
point 67 degrees and 35 minutes above and 23 degrees and 12 minutes to <br>
the left of my reference point at exactly 3:57 PM.', even in a <br>
metalanguage.<br>
   I like Bart Kosko's notion that Trotskian statements should be <br>
assigned a fuzzy truth value.  An absolutely true statement is not <br>
likely to be found outside of tautology (formal logic), so it is <br>
sensible to assign 'le ciel est bleu' a .99 truth value on a clear day <br>
at noon, and a .4 value in general, signifying that the sky is blue some <br>
of the time (The sky is black would probably have a slightly higher <br>
truth value, as the sky is black at night even if it is overcast, <br>
although you might wish to factor in the presence of stars.)  This <br>
method also allows you to provide adjustments based on situation and <br>
location, so you could assign that statement a .25 value within the <br>
cloudy confines of Seattle.  Some people dislike the lack of absolute <br>
precision, but I think it preferable to the neurotic potential of the <br>
endless search for "true" statements.  Using this method, every <br>
statement is true, although many are only true to a 0 degree.<br>
