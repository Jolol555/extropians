<p>
Remember that progress in silicon computing hardware to date has been<br>
mostly based on increasing the number of devices per square mm, *not* per<br>
cubic mm.  That is, our computers still occupy a flat surface area perhaps<br>
a few microns thick.  there is no practical incentive to go "up" until we<br>
hit the atomic scale.<br>
<p>
And it's interesting that about the same time we'll hit that limit we gain<br>
the tools to build up and out in volume, and probably to make computers<br>
even more cheaply.  Power consumption/cooling becomes a real limit some<br>
time after hitting the molecular scale, though.<br>
<p>
Has anyone the numbers handy?  How many TOPS can one get for 100 watts of<br>
power (half a PC's power consumption), without reversible computing?<br>
