This is a confusion of terms. Quantum electronics is not the same as <br>
quantum computing. Quantum electronics is simply electronics at a scale <br>
where quantum effects become important. It is not necessary to create a <br>
superposition of computational basis states in order to have a <br>
functioning quantum electronic device. Such superpositions are, however, <br>
essential to the functioning of a quantum computer (and they were <br>
certainly created in this implementation of Grover's algorithm), and they <br>
are what makes quantum computing a lot more difficult to achieve than <br>
quantum electronics.<br>
