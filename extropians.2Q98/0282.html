Low GI is good for diabetics (and probably for the rest of us) but low-carb<br>
isn't.<br>
They used to recommend low-carb diets for diabetics, for precisely the reason<br>
you<br>
describe.  However, in the 50's studies showed that diabetics on high-carb<br>
diets<br>
outlived those on low-carb diets, with better health.  Ever since, the<br>
standard <br>
recommendation has been high-carb, low-GI.<br>

<p>
It is possible to get your fats and protein from vegetable sources<br>
(which wouldn't include whey or egg).  However, you cannot<br>
eat anything that's not processed down to components.  Even<br>
avocados and peanuts have too much carbohydrate for a ketogenic<br>
diet.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your first-hand information on ketogenic diets.  I wasn't<br>
aware that anybody had done any research on long-term ketosis and<br>
would greatly appreciate those references.  Short-term OK, long-term<br>
bad is certainly a reasonable result.<br>
