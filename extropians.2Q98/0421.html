hi<br>
<p>
heres some info from www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/basicfax.htm<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The number of drug deaths in the US in a typical year is as follows: <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
•Tobacco kills about 390,000. <br>
•Alcohol kills about 80,000. <br>
•Sidestream smoke from tobacco kills about 50,000. <br>
•Cocaine kills about 2,200. <br>
•Heroin kills about 2,000. <br>
•Aspirin kills about 2,000. <br>
•Marijuana kills 0. There has never been a recorded death due to marijuana at<br>
any time in US history. <br>
•All illegal drugs combined kill about 4,500 people per year, or about one<br>
percent of the number killed by alcohol and tobacco. Tobacco kills more people<br>
each year than all of the people killed by all of the illegal drugs in the<br>
last century.   &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
I think those numbers are from the actual drugs themselves, there are lots of<br>
deaths from people being killed in drug deals, and if they were legalized,<br>
that wouldnt happen.  I read something, that one of the reasons a lot of<br>
people take cocaine is because its expensive, and assumed to be of quality,<br>
you know, rich people and movie stars, you always hear about it, they wouldnt<br>
being sniffing glue, although that can get you high too, and its addictive.<br>
If cocaine were legal it would be cheap, or could be made to be cheap like<br>
glue (btw the CIA makes money from cocaine, or has in the past, lots of it, so<br>
im sure they like it where it is).<br>
