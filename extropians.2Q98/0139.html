<i>&gt; From:          mark@unicorn.com</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Governments exist primarily because historically centralization has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; more efficient and required to defeat other invading governments. With</i><br>
<i>&gt; current weaponry and communications technologies this is no longer the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case; in fact government centralization is a weakness when the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; US government could be wiped out by one fanatic with a van-nuke. Hence</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing government paranoia, which serves only to increase the </i><br>
<i>&gt; probability that the White House will move to the stratosphere.</i><br>
<p>
At least then the politicos would be in touch with *some* part of <br>
this planet...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Criminal organisations generally exist because of bad laws; remove</i><br>
<i>&gt; victimless crime laws and most of them would have no way to make money</i><br>
<i>&gt; other than direct use of force. Sadly, the generation who learnt their</i><br>
<i>&gt; lesson with prohibition were dying out by the arrival of the 'War on </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some Drugs'.</i><br>
<p>
Qualifier on that: the "war on some drugs" was initiated partially on <br>
the insistence of the enforcement agents of Prohibition, so that they <br>
would have jobs after Prohibition ended.  It has varied in publicity <br>
and emphasis since then, but it has never stopped.<br>
