You and I are already in agreement.  In fact I appreacite the insights you have<br>
<p>
brought to the table.  I am playing devil's advocate with the other<br>
free-marketeers to see how solid the ground of their assumptions are, and if<br>
they can withstand debate.  Many of them are either not up to the challenge I<br>
am giving, or they conclude that we must increasingly work harder in order to<br>
keep up, or perish.<br>
<p>
A point they seem to overlook, is if the overall economy and means of<br>
production are accelerating, why then would a increasingly larger segment have<br>
to work harder just to keep up?  Simple mathematics tells us that either more<br>
and more people will be better off (as you have eloquently demonstrated), or<br>
conversely a decreasingly smaller elite grabs the whole pie.<br>
<p>
If their conclusion is the latter, then it's a major blow to any free-market<br>
principle.  At this point, why would the rest of us give a damn about<br>
free-markets when it means increasing numbers of people will suffer?  If they<br>
are standing behind their principles of insisting on free-markets despite the<br>
large loss of human life, what does this say about them?  This is the *real*<br>
isssue I'm forcing.<br>
<p>
