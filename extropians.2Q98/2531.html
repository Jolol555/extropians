<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; In one line, tell me in what reference frame A gets larger.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: A gets larger with reference to B: A<br>
   observes that B is smaller and therefore <br>
   he himself is larger than B. B observes <br>
   that A is smaller and therefore that<br>
   he is larger than A. Pretty simple.<br>
 <br>
<p>
   This is what A sees, his ruler and B's:<br>
<p>
                         ___________<br>
    Their ruler:         |||||||||||<br>
<i>                         |_________|</i><br>
               ____________________<br>
    My ruler:  | | | | | | | | | | |<br>
<i>               |___________________|</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   Please notice that "my" ruler is larger.<br>
   B also sees "my" (i.e., his) ruler larger.<br>
   This entirely answers your latest rebuttal.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   The fact that both observers witness</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   the same thing does not break this </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   symmetry of relational structure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Both observers see themselves </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   as larger than the other:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 	  A  B   (how I appeared)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 	A 0  +</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 	B +  0</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Did you make another error here?  "Both observers see themselves as</i><br>
<i>&gt;larger than the other..."  0 is self, and 0 is SMALLER than +, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;larger.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: This is what the charts say <br>
   for A, which is reading down from A:<br>
<p>
             A  B<br>
            ______<br>
         A | 0  - |<br>
<i>           |      |</i><br>
         B | -  0 |<br>
           --------<br>
<p>
   A: I stayed the same size to me<br>
   (0), and B got smaller (-) to me.<br>
<p>
             A  B<br>
            ______<br>
         A | 0  + |<br>
<i>           |      |</i><br>
         B | +  0 |<br>
           --------<br>
<p>
   A: I stayed the same size to me, <br>
   but I got larger relative to B.<br>
   (Which is also what B observes,<br>
   that he (B) got larger than A.)<br>
<p>
   The first chart defines what happens to the <br>
   other guy's ruler relative to me as I see it <br>
   and the second describes what happened to <br>
   my ruler relative to other as I see it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;When they get moving, B's meter stick looks to be 0.8m long.  So, you want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to say A's meter stick is growing?  Relative to what?  Not B: B perceives</i><br>
<i>&gt;A's meter stick to be SHRINKING, not growing.  What is A growing relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;to? </i><br>
<p>
   IAN: A is growing relative to B. You <br>
   see, A observes B to be smaller, but<br>
   has A gotten larger than B? The only <br>
   way for A to know is look at B. If B <br>
   is smaller, then A has gotten larger.<br>
   This is because size is relative.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Because B was also size 1, it could </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   be stated now that A = 1.5, for no</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   point of size-reference is absolute.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Except that this is true in no reference frame, for if you measure A from</i><br>
<i>&gt;B's reference frame, you do NOT get 1.5: you get 0.5.  If someone, ANYONE,</i><br>
<i>&gt;measured that meter stick to be 1.5m long, I'd agree.  Except A never</i><br>
<i>&gt;measures any meter sticks to be longer than 1m, and neither does B.  So,</i><br>
<i>&gt;from what reference frame is A 1.5m long?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: From A's reference frame his ruler <br>
   is as long as (actually) 2 of B's rulers,<br>
   if A's rulers is twice as long as B's.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: There is no absolute size, you cannot have </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   "got smaller" free from "got larger." Observer </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   A will measure the situation and see that there </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   are two sides of the relative change: he himself </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   got larger than B because B got smaller than A.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Relative to WHAT?  A got larger relative to B?  &lt;BZZT&gt; No, A got SMALLER</i><br>
<i>&gt;relative to B. Try again.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: A sees B, A measures A relative <br>
   to A's observation of B, A does NOT <br>
   measure A relative to how B sees A. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Until you can provide a reference frame in which B grows (that is, from</i><br>
<i>&gt;the perspective of observer X, B is 1.5m long) you haven't proved</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything.  And unfortunately, from A's perspective all sticks are &lt;= 1m.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Same for B.  And with that, you're out of perspectives.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I've now answered this about 15x now.<br>
   The implicit phrasing of the charts is a <br>
   little confusing. But this is cleared up.<br>
   As we can see, if A appears larger than<br>
   B, then A is said to be larger than B.<br>
