Here's the web page of perhaps the leading <br>
scientist and proponent, Dr. Mark Carlotto, <br>
of the possibility that the "Mars face" <br>
is a non-natural formation:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html">http://www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html</a> <br>
<p>
Here is his analysis of the new MGS images:<br>
<p>

<p>
The image that all the papers that I saw ran, <br>
was a "contrast enhanced" image, which made the <br>
face appear falsely to be flat. Apparently the <br>
MGS satellite keeps missing the "pyramids,"<br>
which are forms very near the "face" that <br>
seem to be symmetrical 5-sided pyramids, <br>
based upon the old Viking images. <br>
<p>
My first impression of the new images was, <br>
"Well so much for the "Mars face'," but the<br>
symmetry of the outline of the "face" and the <br>
perfectly straight parallel lines of the "helmet,"<br>
wow!... I WANT to believe it was made by life.<br>
<p>
The formation coming off the "chin" and running<br>
to the right seems to be a natural mountain. <br>
Obviously much of the face appears to be <br>
far more natural than the Viking image<br>
would suggest. But what would a face<br>
carved look like after X 1000 years?<br>
<p>
Likely that if once-existing Martians did <br>
make it, they would have used a large natural <br>
form such as a mountain as the base. Maybe they<br>
didn't get the chin finished before doom set in?<br>
<p>
Maybe, maybe, and maybe not...???<br>
