<i>&gt; So are you in agreement with my previous statement?  "Universal vote"</i><br>

<p>
Well, it's more like control of all by the many, since the majority are<br>
usually not exempt from the rules they make (what would be the point?).<br>
We might suppose it redundant to *bind* the majority to that for which<br>
they voted, but they may be unwilling to do whatever it is unless *all*<br>
are constrained to do it (because of the free rider problem, for<br>
example).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; just as "market direction" could be (vote with your money?).</i><br>
<p>
The difference here is that the market very rarely makes a *universal*<br>
choice.<br>
<p>
If I "vote" with my money to decree that cilantro is not food, even if<br>
I'm in a majority there are still a minority who buy and eat cilantro,<br>
and a minority of restaurants who use it.<br>
<p>
And though in fact I am evidently in a tiny minority, most restaurants<br>
will leave out the cilantro if I ask them to.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; [...] all the actions of the firm</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; outside, both I and the firm interact with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; many others as peers; this web of activity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has no center.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But what about your firms interaction with individuals (i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; customers)?   Do you consider that a centralist relationship? </i><br>
<p>
Where's the center?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your customers control (vote by money) the company which takes</i><br>
<i>&gt; precedence over the decisions of individual customers or smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; groups of customers. </i><br>
<p>
It's a very incomplete precedence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Individual customers don't set their own prices, decide on</i><br>
<i>&gt; which products you make, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Well, not in my present firm, no; I assume all clients are offered<br>
essentially the same contract.  But my previous employer sets different<br>
terms for each client (often giving them a choice), because their<br>
circumstances vary and they want different services.<br>
<p>
In each case, clients are free to shop around for a better deal, whether<br>
for a lower price or for services more fitting to their needs.<br>
Where's the center?<br>
