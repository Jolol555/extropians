Elaborating on recent threads...<br>
<p>
Operating system: constitutional "monarchy".<br>
<p>
Automatization is pushed to the max in all fields --&gt;<br>
<p>
-- no-one is forced to work for a living anymore, there is a decent "bottom<br>
standard" (free housing, food, clothing, gas, water etc.)<br>
-- everyday life gets more user-friendly because machines<br>
are faster, better, considerably more reliable and politer than humans<br>
-- the road is cleared for massive progress, now that one of the major<br>
obstacles has been eliminated<br>
-- those who want more than just the minimum and those who like to <br>
keep busy will still be active in those jobs that can't be automated yet.<br>
They have a fairly standard (money) economy, buying services from<br>
eachother and/or goods from specialized (private) shops etc. Anyone<br>
can at any time try to join the regular economy, failure has no serious<br>
consequences (unless you make debts with the wrong kind of people, <br>
of course;-).<br>
-- some people will abuse their newly found freedom, so the justice system<br>
needs to be swift and sure (see the "Justice &amp; punishment" thread). Note:<br>
only truly harmful acts should be punished (I think it's clear what that means).<br>
-- in return for the freedom and unpredcedented welfare people should take<br>
fewer, preferably none, children. The system cannot maintain unlimited<br>
numbers of non-working individuals. For the same reason immigration<br>
would have to be strictly monitored, preferably only allowing those who<br>
have the skills and willingness to work (actively contribute). As the level<br>
of automatization and efficiency increases, these rules can be adapted<br>
(allowing more children/immigrants).<br>
-- education is also free (and of course as automated as possible) and is<br>
focussed on teaching people critical thinking skills (and transhumanism,<br>
of course ;-) apart from the more standard subjects like maths, languages<br>
etc.<br>
-- of course the transition must be _gradual_, the state using tax money (and<br>
income from national lotteries, sex industry, narcotics sale and other such <br>
lucrative businesses (with high quality standards, of course)) to build the first <br>
automated, largely self-maintained factories. As automation increases taxes<br>
can be reduced until there is nothing left. What can't be made for (virtually)<br>
free will be paid for with income from the abovementioned "lucrative businesses"<br>
(preferably no state monopoly, btw).<br>
<p>
Inevitably at a certain point the Singularity hits, and all becomes obsolete,<br>
but untill then this just might work.<br>
