I like it, Scott, and that's not to disparage the other definitions<br>
others may have offered, but it kind of ties in with a Randy-Smith<br>
truism:  many, if not most, humans are, in some fundamental way,<br>
unhappy. That ultimate state of self-actualization would seemingly<br>
elude us until that day that Nanotech Arrives In All Its Glory. One<br>
would think when one controls matter on a nanotech scale,<br>
self-actualization is only a matter of twiddling brain biochemistry.<br>
<p>
There would seem to be gene survival advantages in the unhappy and<br>
self-actualization-seeking human.<br>
<p>
As far as utilizing "rational technologies" to acheive<br>
self-actualization" ends, I guess it is a transition from the<br>
"spiritual technologies" previously used, eh?<br>
<p>
I have heard that many cryonicists (and I understand that many<br>
extropians are cryos or wannabe cryos) see cryonics as a chance at<br>
another life, one in which they can fulfill their goals<br>
(self-actualize).  Comments?<br>
