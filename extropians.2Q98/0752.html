Odd, because that's an MGS image (see the original at <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD2/cydonia2m_tjp_bot.gif">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD2/cydonia2m_tjp_bot.gif</a>) and Hoagland,<br>
'Mr Face' himself, claims it's a pyramid. Quite clearly it's not, and only<br>
looks a little like one because of the human's natural tendency to 'draw<br>
lines' between dots.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Here you will see the planned second sweep </i><br>
<i>&gt;   and the actual sweep. It was going to get </i><br>
<i>&gt;   one of the pyramids, but D'oh! missed: </i><br>
<p>
It was probably part of THE CONSPIRACY that FAKED the Mars Face photos...<br>
but now we're onto them they don't DARE fake any more so they had to <br>
miss it. The Face-Freaks are TOO SMART for NASA.<br>
<p>
Of course out in reality-land they only said they had a 30-50% chance of<br>
getting the images, so I was amazed that they got the 'lumpy-bumpy rock <br>
thing' on the first try.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   In these Viking images you can see both pyramids.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Notice the largest one on the lower right side.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   While the Viking images may be fuzzier than the </i><br>
<i>&gt;   MGS images, the hard lines are hard lines.</i><br>
<p>
Uh-huh, but most of the 'lines' don't really exist; as far as I can see<br>
they're just optical illusions like Hoagland's pyramid image. The remainder<br>
are no more unusual than mountains on Earth, and as for the 'perfect shadows'<br>
you talk about, you should really try looking at the shadow of a mountain<br>
sometime. I've watched sunrise from the top of Mt Fuji, and its shadow is<br>
just as 'perfect' a triangle as any of those 'pyramids'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And the </i><br>
<i>&gt;   MGS images of the face reveal perfectly straight,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   parallel running lines and perfectly ovoid curves.</i><br>
<p>
Look, it's not a face, it's a lumpy-bumpy rock thing, OK; it looks nothing<br>
like a face to anyone but those who have too much invested in the whole<br>
face hysteria to change their minds. I, for one, have seen no 'perfectly<br>
straight, parallel running lines' or 'perfect ovoid curves', nor any<br>
evidence to imply that anything about the rock is artificial.<br>
<p>
Frankly, this is probably my last comment on this pointless thread, except<br>
to point out what I find most bizarre. The original justification for the<br>
face hysteria was that there was a rock which supposedly looked like a<br>
face. Now that there's a high-resolution photo which shows it looks nothing<br>
like a face, rather than give up, we get all this stuff about 'but it would<br>
have looked like a face before erosion wore it down'. If we'd seen this rock<br>
first in the MGS photos we would just have ignored it; the only reason we<br>
considered it at all interesting was because the Viking photos were too<br>
low-resolution to show its real nature.<br>
<p>
    Mark<br>
<p>
P.S. I think I'm going to write a book telling the TRUE STORY of how the<br>
CIA and MAJESTIC-12 used the ROSWELL UFO to fly to Mars and blow up the<br>
Mars Face after the Viking photos became public, so the Aliens had to<br>
resort to making Crop Circles to get our attention instead. I'll be a<br>
millionaire in a few months.<br>
