Hi Sarah.<br>
<p>
I'm responding here in the role of Devil's Advocate, trying to challenge <br>
your response, in order to tease out more details. I'll also try to <br>
respond to my own Devil's Advocacy at points. I do think NodeNet is a very <br>
good idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One has therefore to ask oneself, 'Whither ExI'? In an ideal world, ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt; would sponsor research of its own, working with the greatest innovators of</i><br>
<i>&gt; this and the next century. But those innovators ask themselves precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt; the question you raise, Michael: what's in it for me? I put forward the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea of NodeNet to try and answer that question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At this point in time, when ExI's revenues cannot support self-funded</i><br>
<i>&gt; research, I would say that it is the multi-disciplinary nature of ExI which</i><br>
<i>&gt; could most enhance people's communication processes through NodeNet. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember commenting that any posting member of a node should also,</i><br>
<i>&gt; automatically, be able to browse the other lists, applying for posting</i><br>
<i>&gt; access if and when s/he feels s/he has something to contribute. Put simply,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the key to success here is not the individual 'nodes', but the wider 'net'.</i><br>
<p>
How will this system differ from Usenet?<br>
 <br>
Consider especially that there already exist structures for moderation, a <br>
world-wide system for distribution, a large user-base, and tested <br>
protocols. Propogation is reasonably fast and reliable.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, NodeNet might be able to learn from the mistakes made <br>
by Usenet. I would hope that such a system would enable a much richer <br>
variety of communication to take place.<br>
<p>
Something I would jump at the chance to use is a system which facilitates <br>
collaboration across the net. Ideally, this would combine <br>
video-conferencing with a networked scanner / blackboard system for diagrams <br>
and equations.  Such a system would also provided archival possibilities <br>
(useful when you can't quite recall a discussion you had three years ago <br>
with a colleague), and the possibility for distribution to a wider <br>
audience -- often a discussion concludes with "I wish such and such were <br>
here".  Conversations could also be "eavesdropped on" or viewed at a <br>
later date by a much wider audience. <br>
<p>
If NodeNet could make these kinds of things possible, I believe it would <br>
be tremendously useful. With existing bandwidth and off-the-shelf <br>
hardware it should be possible to set a primitive version of this system up. <br>
The video link would be very slow at first, but would gradually improve <br>
over the next few years as the available bandwidth goes up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is this a big draw to scientists, economists, etc.? Right now, probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; not, and I should imagine that initial progress will be slow. But with</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriately targetted marketing, and free memebership for key</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals, at least initially, the rate of take-up should increase. </i><br>
<p>
I am consistently amazed at the extent to which technical innovation is <br>
centralized in the US.  This has great cost benefits for people wishing <br>
to reach innovators. If I wished to reach the technical innovators of <br>
tomorrow, I'd target Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley, MIT, and a few other <br>
places, inviting bright undergraduates and graduate students to take <br>
part.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suppose my vision of ExI is one of a real-time 'Nature': prestigious,</i><br>
<i>&gt; multi-disciplinary and highly valued by its target community. In order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; facilitate this, it may be necessary to restructure ExI itself, to provide</i><br>
<i>&gt; a forum for 'lay members' and a forum for 'specialists'.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that such a stratification is necessary, and perhaps even more <br>
levels.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The former are</i><br>
<i>&gt; kept abreast of developments, and on-going work, whilst the latter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; initially joining for communication purposes, are naturally guided in</i><br>
<i>&gt; directions desirable to Extropian Principles by their contact with ExI.</i><br>
<p>
I do wonder how likely that is. My own guess, no doubt influenced by my <br>
own political biases (more socialist than libertarian :-), is that the <br>
less philosophical baggage, the more likely the scheme is to succeed. At <br>
times, if ExI wants input from the best innovators around, it is going to <br>
have to bite its philosophical tongue.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; And for those of you who see money as the solution, then rest assured some</i><br>
<i>&gt; revenue generation planning would form part of the grand scheme.</i><br>
<p>
To get something going I imagine that revenue would be needed less than <br>
time and creativity. Later on, such a system may pay for itself.  <br>
