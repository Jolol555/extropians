<p>
  It isn't at all odd!  Classically, all particles can spin (and <br>
  counter-spin) and vibrate on three orthogonal axes.  The complexity of <br>
  frequency-generating properties is awesome.  Anything with a frequency <br>
  has an accompanying wavelength.<br>
<p>
  If particles of light are considered as rotating electric dipoles, they <br>
  have all the frequency characteristics exhibited by photons.<br>
  <br>
  Similarly, if alpha-particles (helium nuclei) are considered as rotating <br>
  systems they will have an accompanying frequency, and will evidence <br>
  interference effects.  Surely enough, they do.<br>
<p>
  I must insist that you not conflate Quantum Theory (initially, the study <br>
  of light as quanta or particles) with Quantum _Mechanics_, which is a <br>
  subset of approximation methods.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; The uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to precisely </i><br>

<i>&gt; measured precisely, the other becomes unbounded.</i><br>
<p>
      Heisenberg's point is that 'observing' an object entails bouncing <br>
      light off it, so we can see where it is or what it's like.  But the <br>
      impact of the 'observational' photons disturbs the object.  Thus we <br>
      may only select a particular (!) attribute for 'observation.'<br>
      <br>
      All this 'observationalist' stuff is positivist old hat and can be <br>
      demolished quite readily.  We can _retrodictively correct_ the <br>
      observation results.<br>
      <br>
      You then waffle on about the measurements of blue photons from the <br>
      sky.  All his life, Leonardo da Vinci wanted to know:<br>
      <br>
      "Why is the sky blue?"<br>
      <br>
      We now know the answer.  Rayleigh scattering by the oxygen <br>
      molecules.  Evaluat this on Tarskian principles and you have a <br>
      reasonable clear truth.<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt; I will further translate E into mc^2 (which describes all aspects of </i><br>
<i>&gt; momentum but the direction).  x=h/mc^2.</i><br>
<p>
     Even in Classical times, 'e=mc^2' was perfectly well known, and <br>
     precededed Einstein by decades.  It requires no 'relativistic' or <br>
     'quantum' hoo-ha.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;   Planck's constant is constant  </i><br>
<p>
    Wake up man -- it's a ratio!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as is the speed of light.</i><br>
<p>
    Not according to Richard Feynman in Quantum Electrodynamics.  Not <br>
    according to the ballistic theory of light.  Not according to <br>
    observation.<br>
    <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  Unfortunately Newtonian physics had to be abandoned because it does </i><br>
<i>&gt; not adequately explain the behavior of light (and other things, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; light was the initial problem).  Your explanation works slightly better </i><br>
<i>&gt; because it is not Newtonian.  Photons cannot have frequencies </i><br>
<i>&gt; independent of other photons within Newtonian physics.</i><br>
<p>
    All of this is crap.  Strictly, Newtonian physics is a subset of <br>
    Classical Mechanics -- the three Force Laws, plus <br>
    instantaneously-acting gravitational force.  If you blend in the <br>
    ballistic theory of light you instantly explain _all_ optical <br>
    phenomena, starting with Michelson-Morley, where the light source is <br>
    simply stationary vis-a-vis the apparatus.  A null result is <br>
    fully predictable.  But people were trying to fit Michelson-Morley <br>
    into a 'waves-in-the-aether' paradigm.  A ballistic theory was <br>
    _impermissible_.<br>
    <br>
    Lorentz cooked up his electrodynamics to give a set of equations <br>
    explaining the M-M result as caused by contraction of the parts of the <br>
    apparatus, caused by aether-flow compressing the dimensions of the <br>
    apparatus.  He misappropriated Voight's [1887] Doppler equations to <br>
    make the wrtched thing work.<br>
    <br>
    All the equations of Lorentz's theory and Einstein's 'SR' theory are <br>
    _identical_   The theories are _identical_ (except that Lorentz <br>
    provides physical explanations).  This allowed aether <br>
    theorists to coexist uneasily with no-aether theorists -- <br>
    <br>
    Einstein says 'Forget the physics -- just apply Lorentz's equations. <br>
    _Postulate_ the speeed of light as a constant in all frames of <br>
    reference ond the sums will add up.  For this to work, you have to go <br>
    with a new mechanics. Go with that, and the speed of light will always <br>
    come out at a constant, because it's built into the structure of the <br>
    theory.  The only problem is that the same object can have <br>
    indefinitely many sizes simultaneously, and physics is reduced to a <br>
    chaos."<br>
    <br>
    Neither Special nor General Relativity have given science or <br>
    technology anything it didn't have anyway.  All the SR/GR <br>
    'predictions' were _prior discoveries_ -- knwn years previous to SR or <br>
    GR.  We can do most Quantum Theory work without Quantum Mechanics.<br>
    We can build atom bombs.  We can build thermonuclear bombs.  We can <br>
    build microprocessors and lasers.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Who needs all the SR/GR/QM crap?  &gt;:-}<br>
    <br>
<p>
    As Werner Heisenberg wrote:<br>
    <br>
    "Classical Mechanics is everywhere exactly 'right', everywhere it's <br>
    concepts can be applied."<br>
    <br>
    It's the measuring instrumentation that (temporarily) defines the <br>
    practical limits of accuracy.  And they get better all the time.<br>
