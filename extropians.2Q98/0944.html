Dear Yak,<br>
<p>
	 I think that both science and religion look for truth, <br>
and that's *why* they construct theories, but science <br>
knows about falsifiability whereas religions still think in <br>
terms of conscious assured possession of truth. <br>
<p>
	I think that religion and science also differ because<br>
religion seeks an explanation of things in terms of a<br>
transcendental agency Who communicates only very<br>
sporadically to humanity and doesn't stick around for a <br>
lot of questions, whereas science looks basically for <br>
testable regularities without regard to the issue of an <br>
ultimate agency "behind" the universe, although I must <br>
qualify this by saying that people thinking along the lines <br>
of Frank J. Tipler (*The Physics of Immortality*) do <br>
envision a God-like entity of some kind.<br>
<p>
	As far as Contact goes, the movie really alters the <br>
novel's ending in terms of "reconciling" science and <br>
religion.  For Sagan, proof of God's existence would <br>
consist of His leaving a message in the number pi. The <br>
movie never even gets into that part of the novel.<br>
<p>
	Two other points come to mind. (1) What did Sagan think of <br>
the cosmological anthropic principle(s). (2) Has anyone <br>
read the fascinating book by Steven J. Brams, *If <br>
Superior Beings Existed, How Would We Know?*?  If so, any <br>
comments?<br>
<p>
	Sincerely, <br>
<p>
	John Dale<br>
