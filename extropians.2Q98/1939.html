It's more than tolerated, it's demanded , a public official who did not <br>
behave in the standard way would be severely punished by the voters. <br>
Politicians act in an entirely  logical way, and there is a very good reason <br>
they're hypocritical, it gives them a survival advantage in the struggle for <br>
political existence. A mutant politician who had a tendency to speak of <br>
unpleasant truths, even if only on  rare occasions, would have a sever<br>
handicap and be politically dead by the next election. Voters would rather <br>
hear pious lies, even if they know full well they are lies. I'm reminded of <br>
the time President Carter in a unguarded moment foolishly said that although <br>
he had never been unfaithful to his wife he had "lusted in my heart many <br>
times"; his popularity in the polls dropped 10% overnight. A good politician <br>
knows that if he wants to thrive in his ecological niche he must swear on a <br>
Bible that in his entire life he had never, ever, not ever for one second, <br>
looked at any woman in a sexual manner, except perhaps for his wife. Nobody <br>
will believe him but everybody will vote for him.<br>
          <br>

<i>        &gt;wouldn't be that way...  but then, that takes effort and thought.  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Something most people seem loathe to engage in....</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Voters are being quite logical also, the probability that their vote will <br>
change an election is so small that it would be foolish to waste time <br>
studying the issues, and you're not voting on issues anyway, you're voting <br>
for people and their promises, what they will actually do once elected is <br>
anybody's guess. It would be far more rational to spend that time lobbying<br>
politicians for special favors, such as declaring your competition to be <br>
illegal and putting them out of business. It didn't take Netscape long to <br>
figure that out, Microsoft for all their skill in other areas was very naive <br>
in politics, they're only learning now how to play ball with Washington and <br>
it may be too late. <br>
