Well, IMHO, a plausible, simple and very near reality hypothesis about the<br>
universe should be: <br>
<p>
An infinite vacuum, n-dimensional (n=?) space... Into it, there is a<br>
_possibly_ finite  energy-matter subset, dinamically evoluting, with its<br>
matter expanding or contracting (?), but with its farer photons (*) almost<br>
certainly expanding universe limits at c (?) velocity... <br>
<p>
<p>
(*) or other possibly quicker particles, or other particles which were<br>
thrown very very far by the last (why only ?) big bang, farer than its first<br>
photons, if was not such big-bang just a local phenomenum and we have not<br>
yet seen anything out of it ...???<br>
<p>
BTW, does anybody remember the medium life of a photon. If I am not wrong,<br>
it depends on the energy, doesn't it ???<br>
