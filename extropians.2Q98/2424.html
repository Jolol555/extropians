At least in the United States, some statistical evidence that the <br>
renowned gender gap between boys and girls has significantly diminished <br>
in math and science scores.  A comparison of 8th and 12th grade boys <br>
and girls scoring on math tests administered by the Dept. of Education <br>
revealed only a .04 difference in scoring, with the boys slightly <br>
ahead.  <br>
<p>
Similarly, scoring on science differs little by gender until <br>
the 12th grade, when the boys begin to pull ahead.  Every analysis I've <br>
read of this particular aspect of it states that this may have more to <br>
do with class interactions than with the actual learning of the <br>
material.  Specific suggestions are made in the report to teachers on <br>
how to engage the girls more actively in class and in laboratory <br>
activities, which consitutes part of their grade.  One interesting <br>
suggestion:  a teacher should wait five seconds after asking a question <br>
before calling on a student.  The boys hands go up immediately, but <br>
girls generally take a second or two to consider the question prior to <br>
raising their hands.  <br>
<p>
This and more measures of gender progress are included in "The Girls <br>
Report" by Lynn Phillips.  Phillips compiled the report through a <br>
comprehensive survey of hundreds of academic and government statistical <br>
sources.<br>
