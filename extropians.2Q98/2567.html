Not in this case, you silly silly boy.  You don't seem to understand that<br>
from B's position, A is smaller, not larger.  So you can't ever say that A<br>
is larger than 0, where the 0 is self.  Nothing is larger than 0 in this<br>
example.  However, B IS smaller than 0 according to A, and A is smaller<br>
than 0 according to B.  Since there is no positive sign, you cannot add 0s<br>
and -s to get 0.<br>
<p>

<p>
True, but the one that is "larger" always happens to be SELF, which is<br>
never positive.  If self is always 0, and the other is always negative,<br>
then where are you getting your positive sign from?  B does not measure A<br>
to be positive, nor does A measure B to be positive.<br>
<p>
In A's reference frame, A is 0, and B is negative.  In B's reference<br>
frame, A is negative, and B is 0.  You can't sum these and get zero.<br>
There is no reference frame in which A or B measures a positive number.<br>
<p>
Most importantly, I can guarantee you that no one will measure either<br>
meter stick to be &gt;1m, *because they use their own meter stick*.  Get it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: Sorry to keep spoiling your spoiler</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Dan, but, as you know, the net difference </i><br>

<p>
The one thing that pisses me off most is a guy who claims to have won an<br>
argument when all he does is repeat something wrong.  It irritates me to<br>
no end.  Please stop saying that B measures A to be positive: it is false.<br>
B measures itself to be larger than A, but only in that it measures itself<br>
to be *0*, not positive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    what I say into my saying "A is larger by</i><br>
<i>&gt;    relation to A," even as it's exactly NOT </i><br>
<i>&gt;    what I'm saying... over and over again.</i><br>
<p>
Look, it's really friggin' simple.  A measures itself to be 0.  A measures<br>
B to be negative.  B measures itself to be 0, and measures A to be<br>
negative.  A never measures itself or B to be positive.  B never measures<br>
itself or A to be positive.  A never uses B's ruler when A is performing<br>
the measurements.<br>
<p>
So, here are ALL of the measurements you have available to you:<br>
A measuring A: 0<br>
A measuring B: - (never +, uses A's ruler!)<br>
B measuring B: 0<br>
B measuring A: -<br>
<p>
What's positive?  Construct an "X, using its own ruler, measures Y to be<br>
positive" and you'll win a cupie doll.<br>
