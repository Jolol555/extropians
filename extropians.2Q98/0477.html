Highly recommended for any liver-related problems, and for<br>
healthy people who are planning to do some heavy drinking,<br>
eat greasy food etc. The active ingredient is a plant extract <br>
("Mariendistelfruchte", that's German, I don't have the English <br>
name right now), and it's extremely safe to use. Great to <br>
stimulate your appetite too. This is not some gimmick, but<br>
a medicine that's been successfully used for several decades <br>
to treat people with cirrhosis, acute poisoning and other <br>
damage to the liver. It has a strong regenerating and protective<br>
effect. <br>
<p>
I got mine from Madaus AG,<br>
51101 Koln<br>
Germany<br>
<p>
There's probably some info on the net about it (LEF?), but my <br>
browswer is down right now so I can't look. In any case, highly<br>
recommended (and with almost immediate results).<br>
