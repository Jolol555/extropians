Right; I'd thought your last post seemed a little too brief.  :)<br>
<p>
I am not certain your example is physically correct; EACH individual<br>
photon has a wavelength all its own.  That particles should have<br>
wavelengths is odd, but true, as far as we can tell.  For this reason, I<br>
think we had best switch to referring to the distance between machine gun<br>
pellets or some other Newtonian physical example; I know a little quantum,<br>
but only very very little.  :) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The change </i><br>

<p>
Hardly.  We can see this from a macroscopic example: if I lead you in a<br>
simple waltz on the Mexican border facing north, my left foot will be in<br>
America during the first measure and in Mexico on 2 and 3 of the second<br>
measure.  (Ignore the fence.)  It will truly be wherever it is at any<br>
given time, however. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   One way to try to freeze the truth would be to freeze time, make the </i><br>
<i>&gt; precisely 5:34 P.M statement mentioned earlier.  However, besides being </i><br>
<i>&gt; impractical in the real world, if time was frozen, light would not </i><br>
<i>&gt; travel and there would be no way for the instrumentation to measure any </i><br>
<i>&gt; value at all.</i><br>
<p>
Fortunately for us, we have calculus to illuminate our path.  A particle<br>
whose location at time t is given by the function x(t) is defined to have<br>
an instantaneous velocity at time t given by the limit of [x(t + h) -<br>
x(t)]/h where h approaches 0.  Handy, yes? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       In fact, it seems that allowing for a discrete range of blueness </i><br>
<i>&gt; has made the ambiguity twice as bad.  If blue was defined as light with </i><br>
<i>&gt; a wavelength of 550nm, at almost every point the Tarskian truth value of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the statement 'le laser est bleu' would be false, except at 550nm which </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be ambigous.  By creating a range, there is an area of clear </i><br>
<i>&gt; truth, clear falsehood, and TWO ambigous points.  It does not seem to me </i><br>
<i>&gt; that Tarskian logic is the path to finding absolute truth if there are </i><br>
<i>&gt; necesarily ambiguities wherever one tries to draw boundries. Indeed, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; only way to create a genuinely universal Tarskian logic statement would </i><br>
<i>&gt; be by defining blue as being the set of all wavelengths, i.e., an </i><br>
<i>&gt; infinite statement.</i><br>
<p>
As noted, in light of the above definition, this discussion of ambiguity<br>
is fishy.  Since particles have a discrete location at a given time, and<br>
since their instantaneous velocities ARE given by calculus, there's no<br>
ambiguity at all on the Newtonian scale.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;We don't need "fuzzy truth" statements: the truth is binary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I admire faith, and thus I choose not to argue against it.  As bivalent </i><br>
<i>&gt; truth is the foundation of an information system, it cannot be supported </i><br>
<i>&gt; using the precepts of that system, any more than you can say that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Pope is infallible because the infallible Pope said so. A foundation </i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot have foundations.  I chose to allow for fuzzy truth because I </i><br>
<i>&gt; find it more relaxing philosophically and allows me to see more creative </i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities.  My support of fuzzy truth does not have any more logical </i><br>
<i>&gt; basis than your support of binary truth.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly.  The truth of certain axioms is unquestionable; A=A leaps to mind.<br>
You cannot logically support a position under which 0.99A=A, unless A is<br>
0.  In other words, if anything exists, then A = A; logic does not allow<br>
for contradictions.<br>
<p>
Frankly, I think you have simply misspoken with respect to your point<br>
about logic; in logic, things ARE either true or false.  It's one of the<br>
defining characteristics of logic.  If you wish to adhere to fuzzy truth,<br>
then you had best dump all pretenses of logic altogether and claim some<br>
other higher ground; mysticism seems popular these days.  However, one<br>
thing we logicians have shown, time and time again, is that the mystics<br>
cannot beat us on our own turf. <br>
