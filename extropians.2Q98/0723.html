<p>
No, it's NOT a type of coercion, for two obvious reasons:  first, it is<br>
entirely under the control of the believer to believe or not to believe,<br>
and second, it is entirely within the believer's power to stop listening to<br>
the atheist.<br>
<p>
If the believer is under control of their own beliefs, then I cannot force<br>
a believer to change them, only (at best) convince.  And if I cannot even<br>
force the believer to listen, then I can't even convince them by force.  It<br>
is non-coercive to the core, and a significant reason why I believe the<br>
first amendment was an awfully good idea.<br>
<p>
Syllogisms:<br>
1)  Axiom.  I cannot force someone to do something which is entirely under<br>
their control.<br>
2) Observed.  It is entirely under the control of the believer to believe<br>
or not to believe.<br>
3)  Therefore.  I cannot force someone to not believe.<br>
<p>
and<br>
<p>
4)  Observed.  It is entirely under the control of the believer to listen<br>
to me or not listen to me.<br>
5)  Therefore.  I cannot force someone to listen to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, just like I think I understand Catholicism better than the Pope.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Religous cults can usually not be correctly interpreted by their leaders,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unless those are perfectly aware of the fact that they are just brainwashing</i><br>
<i>&gt;a horde of money-bearing idiots. The intellectual level of Extropy is</i><br>
<i>&gt;higher, but nevertheless it is a cult and you are its leader.</i><br>
<p>
I am an extropian.  Max More is not my leader.  I am under no obligation to<br>
do anything at all for Mr. More.  If he told me to do something I didn't<br>
want to do, I would not do it.  I wouldn't even consider doing it.  I don't<br>
take orders from him, do not believe everything he says (and in fact,<br>
disagree with his views semi-regularly) and don't think he is in any<br>
supernatural way better than anybody else I've ever met.<br>
<p>
6)  Axiom.  Leaders are capable of giving orders to their followers.<br>
7)  Observed.  I do not take orders from Max More.<br>
8)  Therefore.  Max More does not lead me.<br>
<p>
In fact, by the very nature of extropianism, I might make the stronger<br>
(though less defensible) claim that NO extropians follow Max More, because<br>
extropianism tends to reject that mindset.  So<br>
<p>
9)  Assertion.  Extropians do not take orders.<br>
10)  Therefore.  Extropians do not take orders from Max More.<br>
11)  Therefore.  Max More does not lead any extropians.<br>
<p>
And just as I do not follow Max More, nor do I follow extropianism<br>
axiomatically.  I agree with extropianism because I agree with OTHER<br>
fundamental principles which agree with extropianism.  When I make a<br>
decision, I do not ask myself what extropy, what my other fundamental<br>
principles tell me is right.  Cults claim to be true by assumption.  They<br>
presume that their tenets are axiomatic and undoubtedly true.  Their<br>
fundamentals are simply right, and there is no argument to be made.<br>
Extropy is not a cult.<br>
<p>
12)  Definition:  Cults consist of a set of unquestionable fundamental<br>
principles.<br>
13)  Observed.  Extropianism does not have any unquestionable fundamental<br>
principles.<br>
<p>
(13 deserves a bit of defense, but only a bit:  The "Extropian Principles"<br>
document is in version 2.6 last I checked; any part of the document can be<br>
changed.  Moreover, most extropians endorse pancritical rationalism, a meme<br>
which tends to reject unquestionable fundamental principles.)<br>
<p>
14)  Therefore.  Extropianism is not a cult.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;OK, I summarize: Extropian thinking must not be criticized on this mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt;list.</i><br>
<p>
This is misleading.  It's fine for extropianism to be criticized; that's<br>
what keeps us all rational.  However, we also like to have positive<br>
discussions about extropy, in which we aren't defending extropianism from<br>
criticism but rather discuss ways to bring extropy about.  As you can see,<br>
both discussions are perfectly normal and proper; we only make the extra<br>
leap to say that we would prefer to have these different discussions on<br>
separate lists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your fundamentals are built on sand, and that's why you cannot take</i><br>
<i>&gt;criticism.</i><br>
<p>
The fundamentals of extropianism are not inviolate columns of stone; the<br>
fact that you seem to think so (IMO) belies your misunderstanding of the<br>
philosophy.  And if we cannot take criticism, how and why would I reply<br>
with syllogisms rather than insults?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course I haven't even started to seriously criticize Extropy.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;quivers with fear&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But even a little rant in my spare time seems to be too much to take. If my</i><br>
<i>&gt;postings disturb you, why not set up a mail filter? Might make life easier.</i><br>
<p>
They don't disturb me.  We just like to talk about different things in<br>
different lists.  Is that cultish?<br>
