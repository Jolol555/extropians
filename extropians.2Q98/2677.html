EV, there were actually two such series. The one you are referring to<br>
was published in the '50s and '60s. That was "Tom Swift, Jr." The earlier<br>
series was published in the '20s and 30s' (?). That was "Tom Swift". In the<br>
earlier series, Tom and friends built amazing stuff in the garage, mostly.<br>
In the later series, Tom Swift Jr. built stuff mostly in the labs at his father's<br>
(yes Jr is Tom's son) Hi tech megacorporation.<br>
<p>
In each case, the series were simple-minded adventure science<br>
fiction geared toward kids. I loved the second series and read all<br>
I could get my hands on. I ended up reading As many of the older<br>
series as I could also. I loeved them, too.<br>
<p>
My kids now read "Animorphs", which seems to be today's kid-oriented<br>
science fiction series. The science themes are more modern, but the<br>
science is less rigorous.<br>
