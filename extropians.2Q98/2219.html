"The primary objective of this trip is to understand the Chinese <br>
government's policy and role in education relative to academic standards, <br>
funding, and teacher development. ... Site visits and meetings with our <br>
professional counterparts will be invaluable in understanding the Chinese <br>
culture and educational values."<br>
Read the communique below my remarks, and note the utter smugness and pride <br>
in the writer's tone. These taxpayer supported reds do believe their long <br>
aspired to dream is finally here. And, unless some parents become mighty <br>
enraged, they will have succeeded in ruining millions of children for all <br>
time. Lenin and Stalin did it. The result is a Soviet territory, never <br>
mind independent nations, completely unable to lift themselves out of the <br>
horror of the serf mentality. <br>
See America 2000/Goals 2000, edited by James R. Patrick, from Citizens from <br>
Academic Excellence, P.O. Box 11164 Moline Illinois, 61265. The huge <br>
volume did cost $20.00 when released in 1994. The agreement to make <br>
possible teacher training was between the US and the USSR, to facilitate <br>
the general state of relations between their nations. It was signed in <br>
Moscow in 1972--so much for the "cold war." No, doubt, the same provisions <br>
are being used concerning China. In the agreement it is stated that the <br>
receiving countries will pay for visiting teachers and/or students. <br>
Patrick details the "new educational programs that would provide for these <br>
sort of teacher exchange programs, at taxpayers expense, no matter how <br>
these participating so-called teachers, more appropriately, now, "world <br>
indoctrinators," would express it. This is all about the harmonization of <br>
all education worldwide, to ready citizens of nations for global <br>
citizenship. Mind washing for the global citizen. AC <br>

A delegation of Massachusetts Education, Arts and Humanities leaders has <br>
been invited to participate in a special People to People study mission to <br>
the Peoples Republic of China in November. The primary objective of this <br>
trip is to understand the Chinese government's policy and role in education <br>
relative to academic standards, funding, and teacher development. Senator <br>
Marian Walsh and 1 member and Senate chair of the Joint Legislative <br>
Committee on Education, Arts and Humanities respectively, will be serving <br>
as co-leaders for this delegation. We are pleased to extend a personal <br>
invitation for you to join us in this exclusive People to People endeavor. <br>
Your particular expertise would contribute to the success of our visit.<br>
Travelling with this People to People delegation will provide a remarkable <br>
opportunity to increase our understanding of the Chinese culture, attitudes <br>
and educational system, especially in light of educational reform efforts <br>
in Massachusetts. The insight to be gained will enrich our pending <br>
discussion unaccountability, affordability, and accessibility at all levels <br>
of our educational system. Site visits and meetings with our professional <br>
counterparts will be invaluable in understanding the Chinese culture and <br>
educational values. Relevant topics suggested for discussion and study <br>
include:<br>
* The Chinese government's role in education for children in the early <br>
years -- birth through age 6<br>
* The Chinese government's role in education for children in the middle <br>
years --ages 6 through 18<br>
* The Chinese government's role in education for children in the college <br>
years -- ages 18 through 22<br>
* Academic standards for student achievement<br>
* Teacher development requirements and support<br>
* Teaching the arts; funding education<br>
As indicated in the enclosed itinerary, we will depart Los Angeles November <br>
7, and return November 21, 1998. In addition to our professional <br>
exchanges, we will also take part in cultural and sightseeing programs. <br>
Spouses, guests and colleagues are also invited and encouraged to <br>
participate in our visit to Beijing, Xi'an, Gullin, Canton, and Hong Kong.<br>
Expenses associated with this project may qualify for a deduction as a <br>
business or educational expense to maintain or improve professional skills. <br>
<p>
Participants should consult with their tax advisor to determine whether <br>
deductibility is applicable. Please contact Ms. Kristi Wheeldon, the <br>
program coordinator at American People Ambassador Programs, if you have any <br>
interest or questions regarding this mission. You may contact her at <br>
800-669-7882 (ext. 422) in the Pacific time zone, or email: <br>
kristiw@ambassadors.com . I encourage you to respond at you earliest <br>
convenience.<br>
The vastness of China is impressive; participating in this mission will <br>
give us the opportunity to observe many aspects of its cultural and <br>
geographical diversity. I hope that you will give serious consideration to <br>
joining the delegation. The personal and professional benefits will be <br>
very rewarding.<br>
Very truly yours,<br>

ROBERT ANTONIONI <br>
State Senator <br>
Not Printed or Mailed at State Expense <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
And who is paying for the livelihood of this Senator and his "public <br>
servant" cohorts in criminal and traitorous subversion? <br>
Does anyone really believe this red dribble is not printed at state <br>
expense, or that any of these incredibly subversive visiting US <br>
officials/teachers/exchange students/teachers training programs, are not at <br>
the expense of the US taxpayer and at the expense of all things civil, <br>
decent, and of liberty itself? And with the full intent of, and at the <br>
complete expense of, rendering US students into moronic lumps of obedient <br>
reds-cum-obedient serf drones? Notice the arrogant and patronizing way <br>
this nitwit red calls adults between the ages of 18-22 children. <br>
If nationwide the parents are so dumb and continuously refuse to know what <br>
is occurring in the class room, then these human spirit breaking programs <br>
and their evil change agent promoters, will proliferate and succeed, as <br>
they are now. <br>

=========================================<br>
Angie:<br>
The whole world is filled with degenerate idiots like this. <br>
The question I would pose is "So what?"<br>
Look at it this way. These cretins are creating a world in which <br>
there will not be enough of a surplus sufficient enough to provide <br>
them with the style they have grown accustomed to -- or in fact with <br>
any survival at all. <br>
What happens to parasites when the whole world is largely parasitic <br>
and the few hosts left have developed an immunity to those parasites?<br>
For example take all these school shootings. The student body is <br>
now either a bunch of little criminals intent on killing each other or <br>
a bunch of sheep unable to defend themselves. <br>
Frankly, I sort of like seeing the logical progression from post <br>
office to publik skrule. Massive state bureaucracies where the vicious <br>
regime criminals engendered sometimes forget who the victims are, <br>
ending up occassionally turning on each other. No big deal. Nothing <br>
much to be concerned about just as long as you and yours are well out <br>
of the free-fire zones. Nothing much you can do about it in any case. <br>
We are not the first civilization which has faltered under the weight <br>
of its degenerate elements foolishly allowed to live and breed <br>
profusely. Look at the lemming cycle. The mass of lemmings in the <br>
4th year just before the march to the sea are not the same as the <br>
surviving lemmings who survive to begin the cycle anew.<br>
Nope. I wouldn't concern myself overmuch about the mass of <br>
trivialities leading to deserved disaster. I would advise people who <br>
don't live in states with easy home-schooling rules to instead teach <br>
their little nipper to draw pictures of assault rifles and mutter how <br>
they "want to shoot teacher." Around here the eddication bureaucrats <br>
are so terrified (and glad that the hunting season is closed for the <br>
summer) that you could get your nippers expelled for an entire skule <br>
year, thus not having to worry about the truant officer. <br>
I owe you a favor or two. Want me to post these comments far and <br>
wide?<br>

<p>
Dear Martin,<br>
Thank you for your most logical, commonsensical and truly welcome <br>
response. <br>
I was so angry with this filth. But, you are quite right. Why <br>
worry about the natural consequences of a bastardized citizenry. <br>
Thank you, for jolting me back to a more balanced perception. Please <br>
do distribute the post. AC<br>
=======================================================<br>
If you're an American (like me) are you still proud to American??<br>
