Wouldn't the functionalist perspective suggest that consciousness is not<br>
an "incidental" by-product, but rather an "inevitable" one?  In other<br>
words, you automatically get consciousness when you have the kind of<br>
complex system Damien is describing.  Any system which has a sufficiently<br>
rich representation of itself and the world is conscious - that is what<br>
consciousness is.<br>
<p>
One problem with this suggestion is that it implies that a relatively<br>
simple computer program, say CYC with its thousands of interrelated<br>
facts about the world, would be conscious to some degree.  Such a<br>
program is far from being able to pass the Turing test, and we might<br>
not be comfortable setting the bar for consciousness so much lower than<br>
that for human equivalent intelligence.  But on the other hand, it<br>
appears in nature that conscious awareness is in fact much easier to<br>
produce than human intelligence, so perhaps this is not so objectionable<br>
after all.<br>
