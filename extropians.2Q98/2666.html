&lt;&lt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure this is obviously rational, I fail to<br>
<i> &gt; &gt; see why saving lives is a rational act.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Saving lives is not, in itself, rational; unless you get great pleasure</i><br>
<i> &gt; from doing so.  Saving your OWN life, however, is.  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It doesn't take a science wiz to answer this question.   Anyone in business or<br>
with any human relations experience knows people by nature are imitative and<br>
recompensive.   You screw someone over, they screw you back.   You give them<br>
something, they feel obliged to give you that.   And people feel obliged to<br>
act on behalf of others when the acts aren't performed (the group and mob<br>
mentality.)  Social pressure reinforces this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a purely utilitarian standpoint, the more people's who's butts you save,</i><br>
the more people who would owe your butt into a saving, or atleast a free<br>
drink.   Of course, not everyone will pay you back, so the more "social<br>
brownie points" you get, the higher the odds of pay back.<br>
<p>
Case :   A person's life is in danger.   Saving that person requires a slight<br>
but controllable risk.     - - Let's say the person is your best friend vs. a<br>
guy in a klan suit.   Won't your feelings towards that person effect your<br>
likelihood of jumping in.   If people perceive you to be a selfish and<br>
unsympathetic character, they're less likely to protect you or look out for<br>
you.   People with lot's of enemies or no friends place their lives in grave<br>
danger.<br>
<p>
To take the hedonistic perspective, "Well, only if its fun," assumes that the<br>
value of the pleasure itself is more valuable than your mortality.    To say,<br>
"Well, I don't have a moral responsibility, but its in my own self interest,"<br>
takes a more practical look at the "economics of self preservation,"<br>
ultimately, what comes around goes around.<br>
<p>
Also, let's just say, it is foolish to help other people.    - - And, you're a<br>
cryonicist.   You probably don't want to expouse this philosophy too much.<br>
Why should a cryonics org look out to preserve you after you've gone ???<br>
Suppose its no fun and it would be better to pocket the money ?<br>
<p>
hence, the philosophy works two ways...   one, if its true, people who live by<br>
it improve their odds of survival.    Two, even if its not, people who expouse<br>
it, improve their odds of survival by surrounding themselves with people with<br>
a sense of debt.<br>
<p>
The only possibility of living a purely self objective hedonistic lifestyle,<br>
is to lock oneself in a harm proof vault.   But by sheltering oneself from<br>
human beings, the aim of hedonism, pleasure can't be obtained... hence :  it's<br>
self defeating.<br>
<p>
Incidently, rationality must be defined according to the ends, not a universal<br>
truth (unless one believes in God).     Likewise, ethics are the means, and<br>
should be judged in the long terms, by whether they lead to the ends.<br>
<p>
Nearsightedness is dangerous in the world of flesh and blood !   We're not<br>
superhuman yet !<br>
