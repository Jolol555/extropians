Yes, so what? It's called phase velocity and it's easy to come up with <br>
scenarios where it's much faster than c, or even 2c. I sent a post about a <br>
year ago listing a bunch of stuff that's faster than light, but none of it <br>
contradicts Einstein because none of them allow you to transfer energy or <br>
information faster than c.<br>

                   <br>
That's true, the earliest reference I can find is 1783 by John Michell, he <br>
called them "dark stars", however it had very different properties from  a <br>
modern Black Hole. If I was far from one of Michell's dark stars I could not <br>
see it, but unlike a Black Hole, I could obtain a picture of it and print it <br>
in the newspaper, I'd just have to get closer in a powerful spaceship. <br>
I could even land on the classical dark star, get a sample of it and then <br>
return to Earth, that sort of thing would be impossible with a Black Hole.<br>

<i>        &gt;The photo-electric effect preceded Einstein &amp; Lenard's [1905].</i><br>
<p>
                   <br>
Lenard discovered the effect in 1902, Einstein explained it in 1905.    <br>

<i>        &gt;You simply don't understand how far-reaching and powerful Classical         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;can't explain?</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
It can't explain why a photon in the vicinity of an excited atom but is not <br>
absorbed by it can nevertheless in about one time in a million somehow induce <br>
the atom to emit a photon of the exact same wavelength, phase, and <br>
polarization.      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A classical model of the atom (based on Bohr's baroque neo-classical       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;[1913] model) explains photon emission perfectly well </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Yes, but only for the simplest of all atoms, hydrogen, it can't explain the <br>
emission lines of any other element, not even helium.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;&gt; Nor can [classical mechanics explain] polarizing filters on cameras.</i><br>
<i>       &gt;Simple: the light-particles spin (on up to 3 orthogonal axes).</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
My friend, you're going to need a hell of a lot more than nine words and one <br>
single digit integer to explain the weird behavior of polarized particles, <br>
and there is nothing "simple" about it.<br>
