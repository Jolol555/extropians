Well, look at it, those episodes which are not directly related to the central<br>
'alien invasion/gov't conspiracy plot are almost always about people who are<br>
changed in some extreme way, from the ability to control lightning, feral<br>
humans, mutated individuals like Mutato, the Monkey Boy, telepaths,<br>
telekinetics, swamp things, clones, etc. it feeds on the natural xenophobia that<br>
most everyone has to one degree or another. Because the rate of technological,<br>
cultural, and economic change has become so obviously rapid in the past decade,<br>
some people are beginning to fear what we are obviously becoming, and feel<br>
powerless to stop. Only a complete idiot can't see that we are in for even more<br>
rapid changes in the near future. Given most peoples natural fear of change,<br>
along with their natural xenophobia, it is no wonder fear the future, and get<br>
such a visceral kick out of scaring themselves by watching the X-files.<br>
<p>
A beneficial thing about the X-files is that, like violent programs desensitize<br>
people to violence in their everyday lives, the X-files is desensitizing people<br>
to change, to the 'alien' among us, and the 'alien' in ourselves. Hopefully,<br>
with enough programming such as this, change and difference will be seen by<br>
reactionary types as rather run of the mill by the time things really start to<br>
get interesting.<br>
