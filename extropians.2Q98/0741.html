I'm laughing outloud.<br>
<p>
This is a funny, funny show.<br>
<p>
My favorite shows are the ones where Art says, if your a warewolf call the ww<br>
line at xxx.xxx.xxxx. I think this is SO funny. The people who call in are<br>
absolutly hysterically funny. Easily the best late night entertainment<br>
anywhere..<br>

people listen every night.. that's a LOT of people listening to AM.<br>

<i>&gt; As an amusing aside, there was a minor controversy over the weekend</i><br>

<i>&gt; employee who was fired when he accidentally caught sight of pictures which</i><br>
<i>&gt; proved that JPL was covering up the reality of a Martian civilization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, the caller, "Kent", was tripped up by Hoagland, who had his</i><br>
<i>&gt; phone call analyzed by David Oates, a so-called "reverse speech expert"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (<a href="http://www.reversespeech.com">http://www.reversespeech.com</a>).  Oates plays the audio backwards</i><br>
<i>&gt; and attempts to pick out English words in the eerie-sounding noises.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He claims that you can find out what people are really thinking as they</i><br>
<i>&gt; subconsciously tell the truth in their reversals.  Using this technique</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oates and Hoagland decided that Kent was lying, and when he was confronted</i><br>
<i>&gt; he admitted the fraud.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Talk about the blind leading the blind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The third and last Cydonia image will be taken today and released</i><br>
<i>&gt; on Friday.  No matter what it shows, Hoagland and company will no doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt; find more to feed their fantasies.</i><br>
