I posted this to the WTA list, but I thought some extropians might be<br>
interested.<br>
--------<br>
<p>
I am currently working on a book about Transhumanism---but I have an<br>
idea for another project. I was wondering if anyone from here would be<br>
interested in putting together a "Transhumanist Reader" which would be a<br>
collection of different essays that would represent a wide variety of<br>
transhumanist concepts. A book like that would be a NYT best seller,<br>
right? Well, ok, no, such a book is not likely to sell very well as <br>
trashumanist memes now are not that popular (which is funny, considering<br>
all the space in bookstores devoted to NEW AGE topics). There would<br>
probably not be a huge profit, especially if a group of authors<br>
contribute, unless suddenly these memes take off--which would be the<br>
point of putting out the book! <br>
<p>
If interested, please, email me at thomquinn@esosoft.com or<br>
evolu@evolutionary.org<br>

Thanks,<br>
