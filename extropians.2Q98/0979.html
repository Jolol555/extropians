PH&gt; 1) Is there a single field which is intrinsically safe from automation<br>
PH&gt; in the course of the next 20-30 years?  If you can think of more fields,<br>
PH&gt; please elaborate.<br>
<p>
I don't know about the timeframe of 20-30 years, but I *hope* it will be<br>
possible to replace all jobs with automation in the coming decades.  This is<br>
exactly what I meant when I started the whole "Abolition of Work" thread.<br>
<p>
PH&gt; 2) Are these remaining fields if any, sufficient to employ the majority<br>
PH&gt; of humanity?  If not, what will the rest of humanity do in order to<br>
PH&gt; survive?<br>
<p>
Obviously they will have to sell some other economic resources instead of<br>
labor.  According to economic theory, all economic resources fall into these<br>
categories: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability.<br>
<p>
Whenever jobs are replaced by automation, it means capital is being<br>
substituted for labor.  What we're facing is the transition from a<br>
labor-oriented economy to a capital-oriented economy.  So, the ideal solution<br>
would be for the displaced workers to become capitalists: owners of the<br>
machines that took their jobs.  (Of course, there's a certain gap between this<br>
ideal situation and reality.)<br>
<p>
PH&gt; 3)  For those who are unemployed and do not have sufficient investment<br>
PH&gt; income, is death the inevitable result?  If not, how will they survive?<br>
<p>
It's a sticky problem.  The problem with a capital-oriented economy, as Marx<br>
observed, is that capital tends to aggregate in the hands of a few.  In a<br>
labor-oriented economy there's a certain democratizing effect, since each<br>
worker is limited to providing one man-year of labor per year.  If you need<br>
more labor, you must hire more workers, thus spreading the economic benefits. <br>
In a capital-oriented economy you can go to Chase-Manhattan and get all the<br>
capital you need in one stop.  The more capital you have, the easier it is for<br>
you to sell it: tycoons prosper, others may fare poorly.<br>
<p>
The government might have to step in and forcibly redistribute wealth in some<br>
manner.  Heaven forbid!  Certainly we should try to avoid that outcome if at<br>
all possible.  I don't know what the answer is.  I wrote an essay on this<br>
subject a few years back.  I'll see if I can dig that up and possibly post it<br>
here.<br>
<p>
I remember vaguely that I had a debate on this subject with another fellow.  I<br>
was pleased to discover somebody who saw the problem as clearly as I did, but<br>
puzzled that he came to a completely different view of how to solve it.  He<br>
wanted a socialistic system where the government would set up a huge<br>
investment fund, and everybody would be forced to own some number of shares in<br>
it.  The fund would be managed by an elected committee.  I was repulsed, and<br>
came back with a plan that reduced the role of government and kept more<br>
economic decision-making dispersed, in the hands of the people. <br>
Unfortunately, I no longer remember anything about how *my* plan worked! <br>
YAARGH!!<br>
<p>
PH&gt; 4) Will most people alive today be able to save enough before their jobs<br>
PH&gt; become automated?<br>
<p>
It probably depends on how hard they try.  Hardly anybody today sees this<br>
change coming: most people aren't saving *any* money.  They're in debt!<br>
<p>
PH&gt; 5) If how much money one has saved is the the key to surviving<br>
PH&gt; automation, does this not portend very badly for young people who have<br>
PH&gt; had less time to save for their forced retirement?  If this is true,<br>
PH&gt; does this mean that the future is going to be populated almost entirely<br>
PH&gt; of rich and old people and their children?<br>
<p>
If there are too many people without the resources to make a living by other<br>
means, there will be political pressure to do /something/ about it.  Just<br>
consider the absurd redistribution-of-wealth programs that are kept alive<br>
today with far less reason, such as Social Security!<br>
