If you follow the "A Challenge to All Extropians/Free-Marketeers" thread which I<br>
started about a week ago, you'll see that the focus I'm trying to achieve is<br>
*short-term*.  I look forward to the immense cosmic future that can be ours in a<br>
post-scarcity nanotech era, but my concern is seeing us get their without a huge<br>
division occurring between the haves and the have-nots.  IMO, there is nothing<br>
better than the free-market in fostering innovation and technological<br>
advancement.  However, the free-market *may* not work in all cases regarding the<br>
majority of people who are automated out of jobs by advancing automation.  Maybe<br>
it will, but little has been show by the staunch free-marketeers that has<br>
convinced me otherwise.<br>
<p>
Join the thread, maybe you will see something the rest of us are missing.  Our<br>
collective "short-term" asses are on the line!! :-)<br>
