<i>&gt; deterministic thinking. There is no 'grand scheme of things'</i><br>
<i>&gt; into which each individual has her/his 'place' or 'task' to</i><br>

<i>&gt; individual has been set by natures genetic codes, or by some</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'higher being' makes no difference IMO.  J. de Lyser</i><br>

Though I appreciate you responding to it, I'm not sure my definition is as<br>
heretical as you suggest.  "Predisposed" and "Destined" do not happen to be<br>
synonyms.  I'm not saying there's a grand plan.  Hell, the fact that a<br>
sentient life form even evolved on this planet is an amazing and glorious<br>
accident.  But, it does appear that we have a hierarchy or needs and when<br>
the baser one are met, we "tend" to seek to meet higher order needs and this<br>
appears to be a trans-cultural phenomenon.  I think it's what truly sets us<br>
apart from the other life forms on the planet.  We're just not satisfied<br>
with homeostatic routines.  In a way, we embody the very forces of evolution<br>
that brought us here on both an individual and a societal level.<br>
