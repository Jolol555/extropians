<i>&gt;Yes, my system would have a military, but this would not be the only armed</i><br>

<p>
Do you mean to say that your military would be explicitly set up to fight<br>
against itself if it decided to get uppity?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We have minimum wage because if you would go much lower people would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;starving. At a certain point, not more than a couple of decades away,</i><br>
computers<br>
<i>&gt;and robots will be better and cheaper at just about *any* low-wage human job.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Only an idiot would still hire people then.</i><br>
<p>
Or a person who couldn't afford their own robot.  New localized economies<br>
can and do form for this very reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Indeed, automation can make prizes drop, but if stuff gets so cheap you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;sell it for virtually nothing, then why not give it away for free all the</i><br>
same?<br>
<p>
It's not that cheap yet; and much of the important stuff never will be<br>
until we perfect immortality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Besides,  a lot of people would otherwise simply have to beg to get even</i><br>
<i>&gt;those couple of bucks in a highly automated world, because virtually no-one</i><br>
<i>&gt;would want unreliable and inefficient people working for them if they can get</i><br>
<i>&gt;a cheap, trustworthy and super-efficient robot.</i><br>
<p>
This, of course, imagines that the marginal cost of captial will plummet<br>
and the marginal revenue product of capital will skyrocket to such a degree<br>
that the demand for labor will bottom out.  Fortunately for us, a demand<br>
shock like this is unlikely in the near future.  Thankfully (or<br>
frustratingly, depending on your point of view), whenever we make some<br>
small advancement in productivity or technology, people want more and more<br>
from it, which means more and more people have to be employed (yes,<br>
employed; even if it's only to program the robots).<br>
<p>
So long as people keep wanting more and more stuff, more and more people<br>
will be needed in the economy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By the number of screw-ups he makes (how many people that were deemed</i><br>
<i>&gt;"OK" by him turned out to be inadequate ?)</i><br>
<p>
Gee, in that case, in order to cover my butt, I'd better just say that<br>
EVERYBODY I profile is inadequate.  "I've never been wrong about this sort<br>
of thing!  Who, him?  He was cured in asylum."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyone who wants can spy back, and expose them.</i><br>
<p>
Expose, schmexpose.  I'm talking about a full scale publicly known military<br>
coup here.  What are you going to do, TELL everybody that the military is<br>
taking over?  Presumably, if the military is worth a damn, everyone will<br>
already know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It depends on the "good will" of fewer people. </i><br>
<p>
The danger of depending on the good will of fewer people means that it also<br>
requires fewer people to screw it up royally.  If there are a few bad<br>
apples in a-c, they can be checked.  If those few bad apples are the<br>
dictators of a government, they can't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You mean caused by corruption and such, the backing of malafide companies</i><br>
<i>&gt;in return for bribes? This problem would be greatly reduced by strict</i><br>
surveillance.<br>
<i>&gt;Also, putting techophiles in office (at least at positions where it</i><br>
counts) should<br>
<i>&gt;prevent the "disappearance" (into the vaults of some company or the gov</i><br>
itself)<br>
<i>&gt;of breaktrough inventions. </i><br>
<p>
While bribery has been part of the problem, another part of the problem was<br>
companies who would publicly lobby for tax breaks, tarrifs, and other<br>
handouts from the government, and would get them, because either the public<br>
or Congress actually believed that they would be a good for the economy.<br>
There's little you can do about this outside of switching to a system like<br>
a-c.  The leaders can always be fooled, even under surveillance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sure, but if you like it, it probably wasn't crap in the first place. I meant</i><br>
<i>&gt;*real* crap, like food so full of conservatives that you'll develop cancer</i><br>
<i>&gt;over time, or a television set with lousy sound etc.</i><br>
<p>
Do you buy a lot of things you would prefer not to have?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't think an initially smooth transition gaurantees anything. At a</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain point a lot of governments and dictators and who knows</i><br>
<i>&gt;what else will see the power they had for so long slip through their</i><br>
<i>&gt;fingers. I'll be damned if not at least some of them would opt for</i><br>
<i>&gt;very desperate measures to turn the tide...</i><br>
<p>
This is just as likely as the US military turning against its own people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;or that many, possibly all, would quickly degenerate into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;flock of hardworking, meek/scared sheep ruled by an elite of enforcers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Maybe, if they like it like that ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They may not really like it, but looking through history that appears to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;the way things sooner or later turn out.</i><br>
<p>
And by the very same logic, why won't the same thing happen to your<br>
government?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Initially, maybe. But enforcement groups of any kind are traditionally very</i><br>
<i>&gt;territorial (like gangs, who have their own city blocks) and I see no reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;why PPAs would be any different.</i><br>
<p>
The same reason why the military hasn't taken over the country.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you want to offer solid security to</i><br>
<i>&gt;your customers, than you must be in firm control of the place they live</i><br>
<i>&gt;in. </i><br>
<p>
Who says?  What if you're in peaceful negotiation with a dozen other PPAs,<br>
covering the same area?  None of whom want to attack each other, because<br>
they'd just lose money in the process...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The US military don't give a damn about such stuff.  And if you want to leave</i><br>
<i>&gt;the US, that's *fine*. It's getting in that's the problem (well,</i><br>
theoretically<br>
<i>&gt;then).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Like I said, your military has a pretty good track record when it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;(attempted) coups.</i><br>
<p>
You're right, it doesn't care about that.  And you're right, they do have<br>
an excellent track record.  So why would the PPAs care more than the US<br>
military, who has so much more to gain by doing so?  Why is a PPA more<br>
likely to turn tyrannical than the US Military?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Greater size usually means greater stability. To give an example,</i><br>
streetgangs <br>
<i>&gt;fight all the time, while big governments only fight sporadically, and</i><br>
since the<br>
<i>&gt;advent of nukes the major ones even don't fight at all.</i><br>
<p>
Street gangs tend to be impoverished.  They also aren't even sort of<br>
participating in a PPA system.  This comparison isn't valid.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, their conscience</i><br>
<i>&gt;(that of the regular soldier) is stopping them from turning on their own</i><br>
people.<br>
<p>
So why wouldn't the conscience of a PPA stop THEM from turning tyrannical<br>
on their own people?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In my system you could add to that mutual surveillance (the people spy back,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and, for what it's worth, they have guns).</i><br>
<p>
I see no reason why a PPA couldn't, if it wanted to, start up a company<br>
where all of its employees are under 24-hour surveillance, in order to<br>
better guarantee security.  And for what it's worth, people under a PPA<br>
could have guns, too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In a more advanced stage of automation</i><br>
<i>&gt;the key to avoid tirrany is spreading control over the enforcer robots over</i><br>
<i>&gt;rivalizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;institutions (that are unlike PPs part of the same system, more like</i><br>
different<br>
<i>&gt;immune</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems in one body than seperate bodies).</i><br>
<p>
Care to explain this in more detail?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Because this system has proven itself, and anarcho-capitalism has (to my</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge) yet to give a working example. If it is so great or natural, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;why don't we see it all over?</i><br>
<p>
I never said it was natural, I just said it was better.  And before the US,<br>
democracy wasn't seen all over, either.  And arguably, the current system<br>
under which the military doesn't turn tyrannical (despite the fact that it<br>
could, quite easily,) is evidence that PPAs could be made to do the same<br>
thing; even better, because people would be able to choose between<br>
overlapping militaries in case one went bad.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The law, backed by lots of FBI, CIA, police etc guys who don't agree (they </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't have to like you but they sure want to screw those military guys).</i><br>
<p>
Isn't this competing protection agencies, in this case?  If so, why<br>
couldn't they do the same thing privately?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Besides, you don't usually get in debt with the military, but with some</i><br>
<i>&gt;other government wing or a private organization or person.  In the worst</i><br>
<i>&gt;case, you'll go to jail. Now try the same stunt with the mafia-PPA and</i><br>
<i>&gt;you'll wish you were in jail...In your system we'd see a lot more mob-style</i><br>
<i>&gt;justice, and a lot less jail cells I suspect.</i><br>
<p>
There's no more reason why this should happen under A-C (less, in fact)<br>
than it should happen right now.  The military could do this, but it<br>
doesn't.  Why couldn't PPAs be bound by a similar ethical code?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Apparently the system is doing fine even without hew laws. I sure don't see</i><br>
<i>&gt;any coup d'etats in the USA...And yes, a system of checks and balances</i><br>
<i>&gt;could reduce any such risk even further (in fact, that's pretty much what</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have with all your special branches, secret services, police forces etc.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems to work OK.</i><br>
<p>
It works OK because lots of people, from the top down, are opposed to<br>
turning tyrannical on their own people.  Why wouldn't the same hold true<br>
for a PPA?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[how the hell did we get here anyway, all I wanted was fair justice &gt;:-/ ]</i><br>
<p>
Fortunately, I want the same thing.<br>
