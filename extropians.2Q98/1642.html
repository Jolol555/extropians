<i>&gt; In the Extropian society, is the core principle:</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such seems to be the consensus, stated in so many </i><br>
<i>&gt; words, of some of the members of this list. If so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then truth is a subset of the set of "utility" (U),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and as such, x is a member of U if and only if x </i><br>
<i>&gt; is useful. So the Extropian principle would be:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "We acknowledge only those things that are useful."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Nazi Party found the extermination of all who </i><br>
<i>&gt; disagreed with their agenda very useful and adhered</i><br>
<i>&gt; faithfully to the utility-first principle that many </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the ExI list adhere to. Does ExI = Nazism? I say </i><br>
<i>&gt; no! I believe it is not the right ExI principle. I </i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that to the extent we are directed to that </i><br>

<p>
To this I answer:  Do you honestly believe that WWII was the best thing<br>
that could have happened to Germany?  Wouldn't the German government be<br>
leaps and bounds better off if that whole little fiasco had never<br>
happened?  Besides, think about all the "Einsteins" which Germany COULD<br>
have kept, but lost thanks to the Nazi holocaust!<br>
<p>
To put this in a more concise logical fashion, your critique of<br>
utilitarianism in favor of "truth" USES utility as its criterion of moral<br>
value.  If using a one-to-one truth function brings about optimal utility,<br>
as you argue, then by all means we should adopt it; but this is BECAUSE of<br>
utilitarianism, not in spite of it. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In the case of countering national socialism, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; utility (appealing to the utilitarian) of truth-</i><br>
<i>&gt; first is that it is not true that your agenda, or </i><br>
<i>&gt; your well-being, is maximized by the initiation of </i><br>
<i>&gt; aggression upon other humans. Einstein escaped the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazis, how many Einstein's did not? Even more, not </i><br>
<i>&gt; killing people but using them as slaves also does </i><br>
<i>&gt; not maximize the well-being of slaveholders versus</i><br>
<i>&gt; a society in which all are free to come and go. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The descendants of slave holders are better off </i><br>
<i>&gt; because of free markets, not antebellum slavery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In sum, I believe truth can lead to Extropia!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's wrong with a truth-first principle?</i><br>
<p>
My problem with truth-first as a PRINCIPLE appears when the pursuit of<br>
truth is actually antithetical to human utility, in which case I maintain<br>
that utilitarianism ought to win out.  The holocaust, for example, was not<br>
a failure of utilitarianism as a principle, but a failure in application<br>
of a good principle.  Had they correctly evaluated the consequences of<br>
their actions, they would have seen that WWII was the last thing Germany<br>
really needed, and that persecuting the Jews was a waste of their own<br>
utility as well as their victims.<br>
<p>
Compare this example to a thought-experiment.  If the pursuit of truth is<br>
more important than human utility, then we should pursue truth even to the<br>
expense of human utility.  So even if further studies in, say, science are<br>
miserable to us, and where TECHNOLOGY would serve us better than further<br>
studies of astronomical bodies, we would still be morally obligated to<br>
pursue truth.<br>
<p>
&lt;thought experiment&gt; Suppose you are studying an important effect in<br>
quantum mechanics, but one which can be put off until later without<br>
significant losses in utility.  Then, you look out the window and you<br>
see: A Drowning Child (tm) [the philosopher's favorite play toy!]. <br>
You could save that child now and study quantum effects later, <br>
OR you could just ignore the child and continue the pursuit of the<br>
one-to-one truth function.  Despite the fact that utilitarianism demands<br>
that you save that child, truth-first demands that truth comes first, and<br>
utility second.  You ignore the child, and finish observing your quantum<br>
effect before even considering saving him/her. &lt;/thought experiment&gt;<br>
<p>
This moral conclusion is unsound by my thinking, and so I challenge its<br>
underlying premise: that truth comes before utility.  Instead, we should<br>
say that the pursuit of truth is aligned with utility most of the time,<br>
and so the pursuit of truth is useful to that extent, but when they are<br>
set against one another, utility comes first.<br>
