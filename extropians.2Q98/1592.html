Stop me if this idea has already been done (I think someone had a<br>
similar idea on this list a while back, I don't know if anything came<br>
of it) but:<br>
<p>
It's now common practise among governments to build future scenarios<br>
to see what dangers may exist.  I propose a list to do the same but<br>
with an extropian edge (of course).  If no immediate practical purpose<br>
can be found it will serve as both an intriguing view of the future<br>
and something to laugh about in 10 years time.  The list would work as<br>
follows: To join the list an application would have to be approved,<br>
the number of members will be kept low, occasionally a detailed<br>
scenario will be posted by one of the members, the other members will<br>
then respond with brilliant ideas and sharp wit.<br>
<p>
Things to be discussed could include:<br>
<p>
Nanotechnology<br>
Artificial Intelligence<br>
Crypto Anarchy<br>
Augmented Intelligence<br>
Genetic Engineering<br>
Etc<br>
<p>
Replies would not be opinions on whether these are good, bad, or<br>
neutral but of what threats they present, what social changes they<br>
could bring, and how they could come about.  For the purpose of good<br>
reading scenarios could also have a fictional element (i.e. Not just,<br>
"what happens if we upload", but how and when it happens in this<br>
scenario).  Each scenario should be given the appropriate amount of<br>
time before we move on to another scenario.<br>
<p>
Comments, opinions, criticisms, lynchings, beatings, slappings,<br>
pinchings, whippings, and general kink much appreciated :-)<br>
