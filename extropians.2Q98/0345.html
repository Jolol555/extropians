Summary: I'm against needless attachments because they fragment the only<br>
"universal language" of e-mail: the ASCII character set.<br>
<p>
  When I was first using computers, IBM mainframes used a character code<br>
called EBCDIC, and everyone else used the ASCII standard.  Because IBM then<br>
dominated mainframes, we would have to struggle converting character sets<br>
between these two conventions that did not completely translate to each<br>
other.<br>
<p>
  I worked with incompatible character sets on communicating word<br>
processors during a consulting project at Stanford in 1980.  That and other<br>
proprietary quirks were fatal to information sharing at Stanford at that time.<br>
<p>
  I was the entire computer department at Affymax in 1990, when our Macs<br>
used QuickMail.  Microsoft used another mail standard. UNIX and the<br>
then-little-known<br>
Internet used another mail standard, and several other mail standards were<br>
out there.<br>
<p>
  Trying to cope with these incompatible standards made e-mailing<br>
expensive and difficult.  The coming of the Internet standards as a<br>
standard protocol has been immensely helpful to everyone.<br>
<p>
   Because of the value of everyone sharing a lowest common denominator<br>
standard, experienced Net users avoid using attachments of any kind unless<br>
there is a compelling need.<br>
<p>
  There is a class of message that requires something other than ASCII<br>
text: files that use more than the ASCII character set, such as compressed<br>
binary programs.  But running programs downloaded from people you don't<br>
know well is dangerous, since a running program can plant a computer virus.<br>
<p>
  On my PC I use the Eudora 3.0 Lite mail program.  This is the free one<br>
with the wonderful filter that now sorts my incoming Extropian mail into<br>
folders I called BEST, MID, WORST, and UNFILTERED.  Those of you who<br>
express new ideas clearly get read faithfully.  Some who are incoherent or<br>
repetitious rarely get read.  This Eudora Lite system saves me a lot of<br>
time.  The few attachments are saved in a directory of attachments.  I have<br>
things set so they will be deleted when I delete the original messages, but<br>
the attachments will waste disk space until I delete the original message<br>
or purge the attachments.  I can't recall ever opening or running an<br>
attachment.  I usually view them as a sign of the author's inexperience or<br>
lack of "Netiquette".<br>
<p>
If we want to include lots of people in our Extropian discussion, including<br>
those who are running software on Macs, the many users of Linux/UNIX<br>
machines, Third World villagers with recycled computers, and corporate<br>
employees stuck with legacy mainframes, we ought to express our messages in<br>
what everyone's software can understand: ASCII text.<br>
