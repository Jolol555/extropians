<i>&gt; From:          Max More &lt;maxmore@primenet.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; While I agree with your other comments on this thread, I don't agree here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Atheism" = a-theism. Since "theism" means a belief in a god, "atheism" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the absence of belief in a god.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, there is another analysis that is at least equally <br>
valid.<br>
<p>
Theism = theos + ism, god + belief.<br>
<p>
Atheism = a + theos + ism, absence + god + belief.<br>
<p>
The latter can be parsed from left to right (absence applied to god, <br>
then the whole applied to belief = an affirmative belief that there <br>
is no god) or from right to left (belief applied to god, then the <br>
whole applied to absence = no belief on the subject of god).<br>
<p>
Or if you really want to be weird, it can be parsed from the outside <br>
in: god has no beliefs.<br>
<p>
Since the languages we are working with here -- Greek and English -- <br>
typically read from left to right, the left-to-right parsing, which <br>
gives an affirmative belief that there is no god, is most likely <br>
correct.<br>
<p>
This fits well with another word: agnosticism = a + gnosis + ism, <br>
absence + knowledge + belief = "I don't know, I believe", read left <br>
to right.  A right-to-left reading would be, I don't believe in <br>
knowledge.<br>
