Like most individuals, I don't know enough about programming to accurately<br>
assess the claims of the doomsayers or the naysayers on this issue.  As<br>
alluded to by others in earlier posts, I suspect that we may be facing a<br>
self-fulfilling prophecy process here.  The public will become so worried<br>
about a crash that they will cause the crash.  The following may happen:<br>
The Dow will probably continue to rise, with a few minor corrections. By the<br>
year 2000 it may be at 12,000 or higher.  But the higher it goes, the more<br>
skittish and vigilant investors will become for a sign that a crash is<br>
around the corner.  The media, seeing it as a huge story,  will gradually<br>
create more and more uncertainty about how big a problem the Y2K bug will<br>
be.  Uncertainty keeps the viewers tuned in for more information.<br>
Eventually, it will become obvious to investors that they would be fools to<br>
risk the substantial profits they've made on their investments on some<br>
computer glitch.  With so much riding on it, the only sensible thing to do<br>
would be to "get liquid" just long enough to be sure that nothing really bad<br>
is going to happen.  After the danger (and the huge profit-taking) is over<br>
(Jan 2?), investors will rush back in to grab all the under-priced stocks.<br>
Fortunes will definitely be made and lost...unless the doomsayers are right,<br>
in which case fortunes will only be lost.  I would like to hear some more<br>
discussion about how we can all get rich off of this.<br>
