Right, just like truth is constructed individually.<br>

The<br>

Same as me. But I also can`t see a sense in believing in absolute truth<br>
which has to be valid to everyone.<br>

<p>
It also depends on the point of view if someone is deluded or not. You can`t<br>
expect others to assimilate to your truths.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;without needing religious meaning. You sound completely sold on the idea</i><br>
<p>
It doesn`t have to be religious meaning.<br>
