I had posted this a couple of weeks ago, but I was asked by a few to repost<br>
it.  (Evidentally, somebody is quite curious about the misuses of art-:)<br>
The book is _Art, The Arts, And The Great Ideas_ by Mortimer J. Adler.<br>
<p>
I found it quite tasty because it explains a point of view about the<br>
misconceptions of  "art" and how it is often thought usually thought of as<br>
that stuff housed by museums and gallerys.  <br>
<p>
"Throughout the dialogues of Plato and the treatises of Aristotle, the word<br>
'art' is used as frequently as 'science,'….  Science and art are for the<br>
Greeks the two fundamental forms of knowing - the former, knowing that,<br>
what, why and wherefore; the latter, knowing how."  But don't let this<br>
confuse you!  It's not as simple as it sounds -:)  <br>
<p>
Adler discusses how the word "art" got so incredibly confusing in the 20th<br>
century by everyone - especially by the art schools (i.e, fine art and<br>
liberal art, the arts,<br>
for example).  (re: chapter titled The Relevant Clarifying History)<br>
<p>
Does a piece of visual or musical art have any content?  How is a sonata<br>
different from a poem?  Continuing his thoughtful and though-provoking<br>
exploration of the substance of basic education, Adler examines<br>
the inherent value of various art forms and considers their significance<br>
within a well-rounded curriculum.  He maintains that imaginative literature<br>
and works of science, philosophy, theology, and history act upon our<br>
intellects and stimulate the discussion  of ideas…<br>
<p>
Although I do not agree in total with Alder's understanding of art in its<br>
full interpretation (he, does state that art is often misrepresented and<br>
all too often referred to something visual such as an artifact); I do<br>
appreciate the following contribution Alder makes to the world of thinking:<br>
<p>
"'Art' is one of the most misused words in the English language."  In the<br>
chapter titled The Current Prevalent Confusions, Alder discussed<br>
misconceptions about art, artist, artifact and work of art.   I found this<br>
chapter particularly significant because he touches on the aspects of the<br>
viewer or appreciator of art and the artist or person who possesses the<br>
power to produce an object of art or a performance or concept. <br>
<p>
"Is not the art they [artists] possess the power to produce this or that<br>
object, this or that performance?  Is it, therefore not reasonable to use<br>
the word 'art' for the skill that makes a human being an 'artist,' and to<br>
use the phrase 'work of art' [objet d'art] for the product of the artist's<br>
productive activity?"<br>
<p>
Here he states that there is an important contradiction in the above<br>
statement if he make the mistake of continuing to think that "what adorns<br>
museums of art and makes the name of such institutions intelligible to<br>
us-is the misuse of the word "art" exclusively for paintings and sculpture."<br>
<p>
I especially liked his summary argument where he discusses imagination,<br>
ideas and perpetual thought (including cognitive acts) that "have reality<br>
in the every-changing, sensible realm of becoming."<br>
