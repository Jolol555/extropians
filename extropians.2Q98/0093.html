Does this sound familiar?:<br>

"The next century can be and should be the Humanistic century. Dramatic<br>
scientific, technological, and ever-accelerating social and political<br>
changes crowd our awareness. We have virtually conquered the planet,<br>
explored the moon, overcome the natural limits of travel and communication;<br>
we stand at the dawn of a new age, ready to move farther into space and<br>
perhaps inhabit other planets. Using technology wisely, we can control our<br>
environment, conquer poverty, markedly reduce disease, extend our<br>
life-span, significantly modify our behavior, alter the course of human<br>
evolution and cultural development, unlock vast new powers, and provide<br>
humankind with unparalleled opportunity for achieving an abundant and<br>
meaningful life."<br>
<p>
  That's the opening of the Humanist Manifesto II, from 1973.  To get the<br>
tenor of modern Humanism, read a little on the American Humanist<br>
Association page at &lt;<a href="http://www.infidels.org/org/aha/documents/">http://www.infidels.org/org/aha/documents/</a>&gt; or the<br>
newer one at &lt;<a href="http://humanist.net/">http://humanist.net/</a>&gt;.  <br>
<p>
  A very current issue that both transhumanist and humanist communities<br>
have adressed is cloning.  See<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.SecularHumanism.org/library/fi/cloning_declaration_17_3.html">http://www.SecularHumanism.org/library/fi/cloning_declaration_17_3.html</a>&gt;<br>
for the Humanist argument supporting cloning research.<br>
<p>
  I have been involved for over 5 years with organized humanism, inspired<br>
by the promethean stance suggested by the quote above.  The Humanist<br>
Community meets at Stanford University.  See &lt;<a href="http://humanists.org">http://humanists.org</a>&gt;.  My<br>
own impression is that Humanists are more accepting of conventionally<br>
assumed limits of human nature, and less interested in extrapolating from<br>
current technology than the Extropian/Transhumanist movement. Sometimes I<br>
get bored.  They definitely are more inclined toward collective solutions<br>
to problems than the libertarians in the Extropian movement.<br>
<p>
  I agree with someone who said that Humanists, although agnostic/atheist,<br>
have more of the Judeo-Christian values than Transhumanists, and Humanists<br>
tend to address issues from more of a religious/ethical viewpoint.  Perhaps<br>
that is why they are so reviled by fundamentalist Christians --- you can<br>
write off someone who is radically different, but it's frustrating to deal<br>
with someone who is culturally similar enough to you to be relevant, yet<br>
differs sharply on important issue(s).<br>
<p>
  Any anthropologist who was dropped into both communities would observe<br>
that Humanists are generally older than Extropians/Transhumanists.<br>
<p>
  My view is that Humanists and Transhumanists have enough common values to<br>
work together in science-promotion, euthenasia legalization, and other<br>
areas.  But to do that we have to avoid overemphasizing where we differ.<br>
If you want to travel widely, build bridges, not walls.<br>
