Andrew &lt;VirgilT7@aol.com&gt;<br>
<p>
	This is getting long, deep, and involved.  That is why I Cc:ed<br>
you directly.  Most people on the list will probably not be this<br>
interested in this thread and will likely hit delete.  I didn't want<br>
to take the chance of missing any other great and helpful comments you<br>
might have.<br>
<p>
	Thanks for your continued dialogue and your comment:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In any event, I do respect the degree of passion you have in</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposition to evil and in devotion to optimism.</i><br>
<p>
	I appreciate your input and your kind of playing the "devil's<br>
advocate" as it helps me improve my thinking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; ... 1) evil will never be overcome or 2) we should not overcome</i><br>
<i>&gt; evil.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Reasons for thinking that 1 is not entailed by some reason R that</i><br>
<i>&gt; reconciles God with evil:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) Evil will be overcome, but God has not chosen to do so yet, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons that are beyond us but that we should think exist because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the existence of a benevolent God entails that they do.</i><br>
<p>
	"For reasons that are beyond us"?  My God commanded me to kill<br>
and/or hate this person!  Don't ask me why because the reasons are<br>
beyond us!  What a lame justification for all the evil done by the<br>
many religions!  Any such reason for why God is waiting is entirely<br>
incomprehensible to me.  I just can't imagine this.  Why is this?<br>
Must/should this be?  I don't think so.  My point is that whenever we<br>
engage in such theodicyzing, evil or hate and despair of some kind is<br>
often the result.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Evil will be overcome once all human beings finish living out</i><br>
<i>&gt; their lives and making choices on earth (you could probably imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt; all sorts of theologies to support such an idea).  Evil is currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary because the possibility of it must exist for free will to</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist.</i><br>
<p>
	Ah, the old perverted blame evil on free will theodicy.  Yeah,<br>
free will makes a great scapegoat for God right!??  First off, placing<br>
the blame on free will (free will in this view must be bad or<br>
malevolent since it is the cause of evil), to me, is far worse than<br>
thinking that God is actually malevolent or the cause of evil.  To me,<br>
free will is something good and glorious and when perfectly achieved<br>
by all will finally eliminate all evil.  Since evil is, by definition,<br>
that which we don't want.<br>
<p>
	The fundamental premise behind such agency theodicies is that<br>
in order to be free we must be allowed to choose that which we don't<br>
really want (what evil or bad, by definition, is.)  But this is<br>
logically absurd.  You can't choose that which you don't really want<br>
to choose if one is really free.  Anything that causes us to deviate<br>
from making the best possible (i.e. non evil) choices, whether it be<br>
ignorance, lack of proper upbringing, inadequate brain wiring/mental<br>
illness/chemical imbalance... or improper training, or even due to<br>
randomness in nature destroys our agency or ability to get what we<br>
really want.  Only when we can overcome all such causes and finally<br>
deterministically always make the best possible (i.e. non evil)<br>
choices will we finally have true free will.  Surely any true God<br>
would always deterministically make the right choices or he would not<br>
be God right?  Such a being would be the only being with true free<br>
will or ability to make all the right choices.<br>
<p>
	True, it would be evil for God to do something like put us in<br>
chains and force us to always do what He (but not us) knows is right.<br>
But instead of this, I have faith that a real God could adequately<br>
educate us and help us achieve the strength and knowledge and so on<br>
required to always make the right choices on our own.  Non of us are<br>
truly free yet, we achieve more and more freedom or ability to get<br>
what we really want every day via technology and progress.  I have<br>
faith that some day we will all achieve perfect freedom.  All evil<br>
will finally be removed (or simply not chosen) after such a day.  What<br>
possible reason could there be for God not giving us more of a helping<br>
hand with overcoming all this lack of freedom and evil now if he is<br>
really out there!?  Should we really try to accept that there is such<br>
a reason no matter how "beyond is" and incomprehensible such a reason<br>
must be?<br>
<p>
	And finally, the biggest reason this free will theodicy is so<br>
perverse is because of the hate and intolerance that must go along<br>
with it.  Some people freely choose good.  We are to love these<br>
people.  Some people freely choose evil.  We are to hate and be<br>
intolerant of these people (rather than try to be sympathetic of why<br>
the particular evil choices might have been made and having a hope<br>
that we might help).  We should work to destroy, or at best cast them<br>
all out of our presence because nothing God can do, and especially<br>
nothing we, who are much less than God, can do can help their evil<br>
free will.  It seems to me that 99% of the hate and intolerance in<br>
the world is directly due to this very popular, yet hideously<br>
misguided notion of this kind of malevolent "free will".<br>
Unconditional love is incompatible with any religion that holds such<br>
as a doctrine, for the Devil (and any followers) must be hated and if<br>
not destroyed, cast out and eternally punished.<br>
<p>
	To me, free will is not malevolent and is exactly compatible<br>
with the non existence of evil.  As long as there is evil, no one is<br>
yet truly free.  I will eternally have faith that such perfection is<br>
possible and will eternally strive for such with unconditional love<br>
for all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) Evil will be overcome once those who are evil see the error of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their ways.  Given that to be evil an agent must be capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational thought (ignoring for a moment the problem of how a</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational agent can do evil), it seems plausible that over time all</i><br>
<i>&gt; evil agents will see the irrational path they follow and become</i><br>
<i>&gt; good, thus overcoming evil.</i><br>
<p>
	Exactly!  And only then will they be free.  Again, why could a<br>
real God not help us achieve this freedom now!?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Reasons for thinking that 2 is not entailed by some reason R that</i><br>
<i>&gt; reconciles God with evil:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) God does not overcome evil because he has voluntarily undertaken</i><br>
<i>&gt; to somehow remove himself from this universe, in order to give the</i><br>
<i>&gt; beings here, say, greater responsibility.  However, since we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; here, and somehow can, we should overcome evil.</i><br>
<p>
	The idea that God for some reason must "voluntarily undertake<br>
to somehow remove himself" from us is about the most depressing idea I<br>
can imagine.  True love means being with someone, helping someone...<br>
Love is not dieing, going away, or isolating one's self from those<br>
they love!  True, mortal parents can sometimes be overbearing and it<br>
is sometimes good to get out from "under their wing" but must I accept<br>
that an all powerful God suffers from such mortal foibles as our<br>
mortal parents sometimes do?  Such ideas just seem absurd and/or<br>
hateful to me.  I would hope that I can always be with a true God and<br>
that I would never have to be isolated or separated from him.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) God is the creator and source of ethical law, and above ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt; law.  Therefore the fact that we should overcome evil according to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this ethical law does not mean that God should also overcome evil.</i><br>
<p>
	OK!  My God is the Devil.  Whatever evil he commands should be<br>
done.  Anyone that deviates from all such absolute decrees will burn<br>
in hell for eternity!  This is such a lame and devilish reason!  Good<br>
is good and bad is bad.  Anything that is Good is Godly and anything<br>
that is Bad is devilish.  That is the only possible way to know the<br>
difference.  If this is not true, then there is nothing rational at<br>
all and no way to know the difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now I certainly find many of those reasons as repugnant and</i><br>
<i>&gt; implausible as you do.</i><br>
<p>
	Undoubtedly for some of the same reasons I've described.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But they show that a reconciliation of God with evil does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; NECESSARILY lead to either 1 or 2.  And that was my point.</i><br>
<p>
	So, then, you think it is OK to hate devils and all their<br>
worshipers, as long as we can still have faith in our God!?  This is<br>
only one of many many reasons why I just can't see how anyone can make<br>
such points.  Thinking like this just makes more evil, hate, and<br>
despair.  If we have true faith that all might be possible one way or<br>
another we need not accept any of this evil and despair.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd say that that's a particularly argumentative way of describing</i><br>
<i>&gt; what a theodicy is.  If the presence of evil is truly justified,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then it hasn't "twisted" anything in showing it to be justified.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, I can see your point.  But accepting any such evil, for<br>
whatever justification, is the lessor theory.  The theory that a way<br>
can be found to eliminate all such evil is the greater theory.<br>
Hopping for the greater theory is having faith, accepting the lessor<br>
is giving up in despair.  We should never give up hope that something<br>
better might be possible.  I always hope that there might be some way<br>
or another found to eliminate all evil and will eternally seek after<br>
such!<br>
