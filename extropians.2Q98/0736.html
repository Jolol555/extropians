   IAN: That's a very good site. No, the image was not <br>
   altered. If you search around the NASA JPL site you'll<br>
   find some Viking images of that area, and there it is.<br>
   There are two 5-sided pyramids. The edges and angles <br>
   on them are perfect, and they caste shadows that con-<br>
   firm their perfect form, even a perfect tip (one how-<br>
   even seems slightly damaged). This is a good analysis:<br>

   What kind of geological forces or events could create<br>
   perfect 5-sided pyramids? Notice that the base lines<br>
   are also perfect. This just doesn't happen in nature,<br>
   at least not that I know of. I don't see how people <br>
   can reduce all these symmetrical forms to "crap."<br>
   Isn't the basis of inquiry to wonder "What if?"<br>
