<i>&gt; &gt;short term difficulty the workers may face.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;interesting arguments on the benefits of sacking people snipped&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In the current Australian case, it isn't that simple.  We're not talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; about unskilled people being replaced by machines to do the hod-carrying.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stevedoring is already a fairly skilled business.  For what it's worth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; here are some comments from an article in The Australian, our major Murdoch</i><br>
<i>&gt; newspaper (quoted without permission of the writer, Mike Steketee):</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; `The Government has enforced the principle that union membership should not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a requirement for working on the wharves... but...at a significant</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost... security guards and savage dogs dragging employees from their</i><br>
<i>&gt; workplaces in the middle of the night.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; `This was heavy-handed action, accompanied by a sneaky shuffle... of</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporate assets to try to escape liability [of breach of Act] which</i><br>
<i>&gt; prohibits the dismissal of employees because they are union members.  Its</i><br>
<i>&gt; success in terms of public acceptance relies on Australians being persuaded</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the demonisation of the wharfies in which the Government has engaged.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; `In truth... they have accepted change, including a more than halving of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their numbers as a result of reforms - achieved by negotiation...</i><br>
<p>
Ah, now this is the interesting part. I'm not totally ignorant of the situation of<br>
organised labor in the harbor/shipping industry, as 'one of my best freinds'<br>
happens to have reached the level of Chief Engineer on container ships (working up<br>
from the bottom), and has told me a bit about what seems to be really going on.<br>
<p>
Most modern harbors have converted almost entirely to servicing container<br>
transport ships, and use highly automated crane systems, with eleborate queueing<br>
systems for handling the tractor trailer traffic as it flow through the offloading<br>
system.<br>
<p>
While operating a crane, a forklift, or a tractor trailer may not be as unskilled<br>
posistions as a ditch digger, the fact is that a reasonably well trained<br>
individual can pretty much master the job requirements in 6 weeks of training.<br>
(Forklift training actually takes one day, but I'll be generous).<br>
<p>
Because modern harbors are so automated, you would think that they would need<br>
extremely few employees, right? Wrong. Just as most of the US auto industry is<br>
saddled with obsolete work rules, and has agreed to not replace more than x many<br>
workers with robots each year, most longshoremans unions in city's where they are<br>
strong and typically supported by the mob, tend to negotiate from rather strong<br>
positions in terms of preserving jobs for people where they wind up really not<br>
doing much at all.<br>
<p>
This same situation is being contested in US port systems. The old unions are<br>
fighting with the help of the mafia in preventing the loss of jobs due to<br>
progress. Its about time sombody fought back.  People need to realize that such<br>
strong arm tactics on the part of unions only make things more expensive for the<br>
rest of us.<br>
<p>
That the number of longshoremen has only decreased by half, under negotiation,<br>
indicates to me that they have been fighting to preserve a lot of positions that<br>
are totally obsolescent.<br>
<p>
As far as I can see, the shipping companies were within their rights in making a<br>
last ditch effort to maintain competetive stature with competing companies and<br>
harbors. I would guess that there are either in that same harbor, or in a nearby<br>
harbor, a competing company that does not employ union workers, and was beating<br>
the heck out of the ones that brought in the dogs and nightsticks to get rid of<br>
the dead wood.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; `So what mortal sin have the wharfies committed to warrant their wholesale</i><br>
<i>&gt; sacking?  It boils down to an hourly container movement rate perhaps 25 per</i><br>
<i>&gt; cent below world's best practice (bulk cargo rates are already at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; international benchmark, though that did not stop Patrick employees in</i><br>
<i>&gt; these areas getting the sack as well).  This is an improvement worth</i><br>
<i>&gt; having, but does it require such brutal action?'</i><br>
<p>
Apparently so, if the obsolete union is preventing the companies from being<br>
competetive. If they don't give up, then they could wind up with nobody having<br>
jobs. It was bound to happen, and could have happened peacefully or violently.<br>
Stubborn unions usually cause it to be the second case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Mike Lorrey might be correct that this is mercantilism rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism.  I can't say, not being a theologian.  But it sounds to me</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather like guns against heads in one of the advanced non-communist nations</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the First World.  (Do note that I am not saying anything about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; merits of stevedores as wonderful caring human beings, nor trying to deny</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own record of thuggish intimidation, theft, industrial sabotage. etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I am simply responding to the claim that capital operates differently from</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialist state enforcement.)</i><br>
<p>
Any organization with its back against the wall business wize is gonna push back,<br>
or die.<br>
