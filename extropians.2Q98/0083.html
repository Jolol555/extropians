<i>&gt; From:          John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; High pay won't stop corruption, regardless of how much money you have it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; never enough. In my world you don't need to tack on anti corruption measures, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's intrinsic to the system. The better job a PPA does, the  more it can </i><br>
<i>&gt; charge. If 10$ more is stolen from me if I stay with PPA #1 rather than </i><br>
<i>&gt; switch to PPA #2 then I will stay with #1 ONLY if they charge 10$ less.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Each dollar stolen from me is equivalent to a dollar stolen directly from the </i><br>
<i>&gt; PPA. For this reason it is in the financial interest of the heads of the PPA </i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep bribery of employees as low as possible. Contrast that to the  </i><br>
<i>&gt; situation today, it doesn't cost the police a dime, regardless of how much is </i><br>
<i>&gt; stolen from me, and they may even make money off my misfortune by receiving  </i><br>
<i>&gt; payoff money from the thief.               </i><br>
<p>
Not to mention "We can't do our job!  We need more tax funding!"<br>
<p>
Ever notice that a government agency that is doing a good job at its <br>
alleged purpose sits there and gets ignored, while a government <br>
agency that is doing a lousy job at its alleged purpose gets lots of <br>
attention and an increase in staff and funding?  And, quite often, an <br>
increase in its power and authority as well, along with the coercive <br>
measures available to it?<br>
<p>
And some people wonder why some of us don't trust government to do a <br>
good job...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Good surveillance brings out the saint in anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd rather be a sinner.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;and all judicial candidates are subject to intensive psychological         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;profiling, not just one but continously.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Psychological profiling is crap. </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Who profiles the psychological profiler?</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The free market is no magic bullet, not by far. Many a good product         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;has failed for trivial and/or incomprehensible reasons. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The reasons they failed are often comprehensible and never trivial. For </i><br>
<i>&gt; example, consider the computer you're probably using right now, the one </i><br>
<i>&gt; you're unhappy with. It's true that if you were starting from scratch lots of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; people could make a more consistent, more elegant, system than Wintel, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft and Intel didn't have that luxury. Everything they made had to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; compatible with everything they made before, this imposes a severe burden, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but a burden the  most popular operating system in the world MUST bear. </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the Many Worlds Interpretation is correct, I predict that on nearly all </i><br>
<i>&gt; those worlds people are complaining that the most popular operating system is </i><br>
<i>&gt; an ugly mess, a inelegant hodgepodge of kludges. Such is the fate of things </i><br>
<i>&gt; that are not designed all at once but evolve and grow, things like English </i><br>
<i>&gt; with it's weird spelling, or biological organisms for that matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's in the nature of things that standards are resistant to change, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; that's OK because that is exactly the way a standards should be. The lack of </i><br>
<i>&gt; popularity of the Apple or Next or Bee or whatever operating system is not an </i><br>
<i>&gt; example of market failure because in the context of the real world they are </i><br>
<i>&gt; in fact inferior system. If everything else was equal they would be better </i><br>
<i>&gt; than Wintel but everything else is not equal. These systems have some small </i><br>
<i>&gt; technical advantages but that is countered by enormous practical </i><br>
<i>&gt; disadvantages, they will not operate on the type of computer most people have </i><br>
<i>&gt; and it will not run billions of dollars worth of popular software that took</i><br>
<i>&gt; millions of man years to write. It's perfectly valid to take such things into </i><br>
<i>&gt; account when deciding what system is really  superior. When a standard is set </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's just not worth going to a new one unless you get an  astronomical </i><br>
<i>&gt; improvement. The market has decided that the Apple or Next or Bee is not a </i><br>
<i>&gt; huge advance of that type. Maybe the market is wrong but I know it has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better understanding of such things than a bunch of hack politicians.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The free market is basically commercial democracy: you let the         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;people vote for products.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, there is a fundamental difference. Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; communicating your wishes, there are much better ways. Every day I send </i><br>
<i>&gt; hundreds of exquisitely precise messages to the Free Market telling it what I </i><br>
<i>&gt; want it to do. I also get to compare brands, I can't do that In a democracy </i><br>
<i>&gt; because I'm not voting for goods or services or even policies, I just get to</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose between two grab bags of promises every 4 years, and democracy is the </i><br>
<i>&gt; best form of government, the best of a bad lot.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When I "vote" in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; always win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not </i><br>
<i>&gt; worth my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; politician with the best hairdo gets to make the decisions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;First of all, how do you want to achieve a state of anarchy? After         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;all, the nation states aren't going to roll over and die just like         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't need to achieve it, like it or not I see no way to stop it. I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; we'll soon find out if my optimistic assessment of a world without government </i><br>
<i>&gt; is correct, because I don't see how the traditional nation state can continue </i><br>
<i>&gt; much longer, they will go the way of the city state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nations will die not with a bang but with a whimper because modern worldwide  </i><br>
<i>&gt; communication, cryptography and untraceable digital cash and signatures will  </i><br>
<i>&gt; make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes, the balance is tipping away  </i><br>
<i>&gt; from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves  </i><br>
<i>&gt; in this brave new world, but making rules is easy, enforcing them is not.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Short of dismantling the Internet and confiscating all home computers it's  </i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible to dictate what form of encryption or digital cash you must use  </i><br>
<i>&gt; in your home. Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't  </i><br>
<i>&gt; find the  money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would </i><br>
<i>&gt; not work as  people would just switch to a competing currency (untraceable of </i><br>
<i>&gt; course) that  suited their needs better. The tribute that could still be </i><br>
<i>&gt; extracted, like property taxes and building permits, would have to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; increased to astronomic  levels and collected with a heavy hand, I think a</i><br>
<i>&gt; tax revolt would follow.  Without money government will grind to a halt.                                                     </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;on who will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen.         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Nobody wants to get caught up in the slow, expensive court system         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;run by governments. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Yet the only reason these contracts have any value is because there         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;is a big government to keep an eye on things, to provide a civilized         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;context.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Except in binding arbitration, when 2 companies go to an arbiter it's like </i><br>
<i>&gt; going to a marriage councilor, they are not legally required to do what the </i><br>
<i>&gt; arbiter says, yet companies almost always do. If it does not then nobody  </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be willing to engage in arbitration with it in the future and that </i><br>
<i>&gt; would put the company in a severe disadvantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Centralized governments don't *have* to  be bureaucratic. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think they do, certainly they always have been. If you're a bureaucrat it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; to your interest to increase the bureaucracy, the same is true of your boss.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"Anarchy" in any form is unstable (it's simply a power vacuum), </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anarchy means no government, your statement would be true only if government </i><br>
<i>&gt; was the only form of power, fortunately it's not. </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;As far as I know, no serious democracy has ever decided to kill of         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;half (or any substantial portion) of its own people. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have a hunch that tell you nothing about the virtuous nature of democracy     </i><br>
<i>&gt; because the sample size is too small. Democracy is a very rare form of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Since there's only your PPA to deal with instead of a huge government         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that's all over I might try to take you out either myself or I may         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;hire as many destitute souls as my budged allows to do it for me. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would not have dreamed of slandering you, or even set foot outside of my </i><br>
<i>&gt; house if I didn't think my PPA was strong enough to deter you or anybody else  </i><br>
<i>&gt; from killing me. A member being murdered is bad business for a PPA, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; murderer remaining unpunished is VERY bad business for a PPA. If I though </i><br>
<i>&gt; that my PPA  wasn't pulling out all the stops in its investigation of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; murdered member  I'd change my PPA so fast it'd make your head spin. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Incidentally, my PPA  forbids torture but not the death penalty.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;I don't understand. Does everybody get 3 trials, even those found         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;guilty the  first time?                </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;No. Unless new hard evidence comes up (before the execution in         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;capital cases).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I must go to trial 3 times and receive 3 innocent verdicts before I can go </i><br>
<i>&gt; home but if I receive only one guilty verdict I'm dead meat. Doesn't seem  </i><br>
<i>&gt; quite right.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Which decision of the 3 trials do we accept? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The one that is best argued and supported by the most/hardest facts.          </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; That immediately brings to mind an obvious question, a question I have asked </i><br>
<i>&gt; of you before but received no answer, a question so obvious I won't repeat it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                               </i><br>
