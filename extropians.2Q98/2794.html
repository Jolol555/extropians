I think we have to include everybody, since there's no easy way to figure<br>

I don't think I understand what you mean.  If the "wrong" theory is a<br>
rational choice, then we have an example where rationality has led us to<br>
an incorrect conclusion.  Rationality can never declare itself wrong,<br>
however, so in order to evaluate it as "wrong" we would have to use some<br>
*other* criteria for evaluating right and wrong besides reason.  Any way<br>
you slice this, it's at least non-rational, if not irrational.<br>
