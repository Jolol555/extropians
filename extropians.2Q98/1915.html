Something has been bothering me for some time...perhaps there are list members<br>
who are more versed in the approriate areas of knowledge and can help me out.<br>
<p>
It concerns dinosaurs.<br>
<p>
To the best of my knowledge the elephant is today's largest land animal.<br>
Supposedly ther were much larger critters in the past.  However...what<br>
concerns me is the strength to weight ratio.  <br>
<p>
I've been lead to beleive that due to it's size an elelphant is different from<br>
all other land animals is some regards...for instance.  It cannot run.  I can<br>
walk...REALLY fast...but it isn't the same as a gallop of other four legged<br>
critters.  Also an elelphant can't jump...the only land animal which can't.<br>
All this is purportedly due to it's minimal strength to weight ratio.  Not the<br>
strength of it's muscels...which is awesome.  But the strength of it's<br>
"building materials"...calcium bones...etc.  ...which are approaching "design"<br>
limits.<br>
<p>
If this is true.   Then it appears to me that the dinosaur hypothosis has a<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
Also the MegaFauna.<br>
<p>
Does anyone have any ideas on this subject?<br>
