True.<br>

Okay.<br>

<p>
Aren't many libertarians Objectivists?  And, just as a simple matter of<br>
political classification, all Objectivists should be libertarians if not<br>
Libertarian Party members.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;sometimes--Rand couldn't stand Libertarians!</i><br>
<p>
Rand's personal preferences and her rationalizations for them should,<br>
from the perspective of Objectivism as a philosophy, be ignored.  One<br>
must separate the thinker from the ideas -- as one should do with any<br>
set of ideas.<br>

<p>
I agree about "examin[ing] all sets of ideas and draw[ing] the best<br>
from each..." with one caveat.  This is that one must be selective<br>
given the limits of time, effort, and knowledge.  There are, sadly,<br>
many good ideas we will miss in our discussions/researches.<br>
<p>
Also, I see nothing wrong with talking politics as long as this does<br>
not become an end in itself.<br>
<p>
Finally, I do not think that the difference between libertarians and<br>
Objectivists are political.  The two groups overlap to a large extent.<br>
Rand's (and Peter Schwartz's) views on libertarianism are, after all,<br>
silly.<br>
