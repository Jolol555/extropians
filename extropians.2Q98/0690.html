<i>&gt;  Indeed, atheism is (often) more than just saying "it's extremely</i><br>

<p>
Structuring your worldview solely to satisfy your ideology strikes me as a<br>
dangerous project.  Gods may or may not exist at present.  Most understandings<br>
of theology make the question utterly unresolvable in a theoretic sense (thus<br>
encouraging principled agnostism).   Practically speaking, of course, sensible<br>
people find it useful to assume that gods do *not* exist, and to act like<br>
atheists in a day-to-day sense.  But none of that justifies embracing<br>
*theoretical* atheism from fear of the anomie that could follow facing<br>
possible truths.  Better, I think, to cut the bluff and learn to live with<br>
limited facts.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  And I shall continue as a quite vocal atheist until someone can present </i><br>
<i>&gt;  sufficient evidence of god's existence and/or that this would not be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  disaster for humanity and transhumanists in particular.</i><br>
<p>
I take it that an atheist in fact asserts that gods do not and cannot exist--a<br>
claim that cries out for positive proof.  But, again, most understandings of<br>
theology deny that scientific methods will suffice to resolve the question of<br>
god's existence.  Scientists typically agree that they have little to add to<br>
theological disputes.  Defending atheism thus take more than mere rejection of<br>
theism; it calls for the sort of proof that, ex hypothesis, cannot obtain.<br>
<p>
I used to think myself an atheist--until I decided that even denying the<br>
existence of gods gives too much credit to theology.  I now cheerfully admit<br>
ignorance about whether gods exist . . . though that does not prevent me from<br>
theorizing about what I might make possible.<br>
