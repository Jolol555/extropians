did anyone else just KNOW CALYK was going to repond harshly to that one? <br>
hehe, predictable i suppose.<br>
<p>
Anyhow, lets say that space isnt expanding, rather it is "stretching" <br>
because of "waves", or probably more like "ripples" of force brought on <br>
by explosions in the universe;stars, supernovae, etc. it would be sort <br>
of like an ocean. there have been current studies to show the the <br>
universe is somewhat in a particular "shape" or "pattern", and if these <br>
explosions happened at a constant rate, which im sure they do, they <br>
would create the illusion that the universe is expanding on one side, <br>
the side closest to the majority of great stellar explosions, and <br>
shrinking on the other side, the side of least stellar explosions.there <br>
would be the constant wave or even spiral like shape of the universe <br>
possibly. there are theories that the universe is expanding, as well as <br>
some that say it is shrinking. the universe could be as constant as the <br>
energy suppply that lies in the universe, cannot be created or <br>
destroyed. that way its allows me to understand more what would be <br>
"outside" the limits of the universe, that is if you want to think of <br>
the universe as an egg out of its shell in the center of a large plate. <br>
or maybe we could go back to the age old idea that we wont just "drop <br>
off" at the edge of the universe, its actually geometrically more like a <br>
globe. im open to "thrashful" comments because opinions like these <br>
deserve some criticism so do give me some feedback.<br>
