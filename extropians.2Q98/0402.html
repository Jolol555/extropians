<i>&gt; Not meaning to detract from your overall point Mike...with which I agree</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Like it only takes a few minutes to learn how to ride a horse....right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I mean...how difficult is it?  You just sit up there in the saddle...hold the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reins...use your knees ever now and then...and everything is peachy keen?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously that is nonsense....as is the idea that you can be a skilled tractor</i><br>
<i>&gt; trailer operator in such a short period of time.  Consider why the major</i><br>
<i>&gt; carriers (non union) pay so much more for experience....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Greater experience means greater productivity...less wear and tear on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment...and fewer accidents...</i><br>
<p>
Oh, of course, and there's a good reason why a medical doctor fresh out of 7 years<br>
of medical school is still an intern, making not much more than minimum wage for<br>
72 hour weeks, or why an engineer fresh out of engineering school cannot certify<br>
plans for a skyscraper....<br>
<p>
I really don't mean to belittle the trade at all. I'm just stating the fact that<br>
relatively speaking, someone with forklift skills is a WHOLE lot closer to a<br>
ditchdigger than they are to an architect in terms of training and skills. Even a<br>
forklift operator with 30 years of experience is still a WHOLE lot closer to a<br>
ditch digger than to an architect....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And as far a CRANE!!  &lt;shudder&gt;</i><br>
<p>
ha, yeah, I've operated cranes, small ones, before. It does take a deft touch, and<br>
not everyone can do it, but its not that hard for someone raised on video games to<br>
master rather quickly...  However, many port cranes that unload container ships<br>
are ROBOTS.  A robot has no union, doesn't demand retirement benefits, or medical<br>
insurance, doesn't walk out or sit down on you (although a new one can be buggy),<br>
and works 24 hours a day with no breaks..... hmmmmmmm<br>
