<p>
<p>
  IAN: Absolutely truth. Base 1 is pre-data<br>
  compression. The set of positional number<br>
  systems is a set of data-compression rou-<br>
  tines; base 1 is not a positional system.<br>
 <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, if you only have one symbol for the base one system, how do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;represent zero? No symbols at all?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: You don't need zero in Base 1 (assum-<br>
   ing that we define base to allow 1) because<br>
   zero operatis as a placeholder in a possitional<br>
   number system; yet base 1, or tally-mark numbers, <br>
   is not a possitional number system. As such, the <br>
   * difference * in the value of any 1 in any base <br>
   1 column in the number 11111, = 0, since the <br>
   defintion of colum value in base 1 is:<br>
<p>
   column     1     2     3<br>
<p>
   base 1:   1^2   1^1   1^0 <br>
              1     1     1<br>
   --------------------------<br>
              1     1     1   =   3<br>
<p>
   The value of each column is the same (or their<br>
   value-difference equals zero) unlike that found <br>
   in any base n &gt; 1 number system. Value jumping<br>
   between columns of all base n &gt; 1 systems is <br>
   the very function of data-compression, thus<br>
   0 value difference = 0 data compression.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think that by the time software evolves to the point of being able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;drive a true AI, the individual bits and underpinnings will matter as much</i><br>
<i>&gt;to this entity as the precise operations of our brains matters to us on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;moment to moment basis. Likely, a digital computer based AI will be a lousy</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer programmer, at least as far as modifying it's own 'brain' on an</i><br>
<i>&gt;instant to instant basis.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Base 1 is significant in that it is the <br>
   real "natural number" system. It is how brains<br>
   count from "the ground up." Our fingers are <br>
   base 1 digits. Real Intelligence (RI) does <br>
   not count with the binary base 2 system. <br>
<p>
   Base 1 is significant in number theory in that <br>
   it is the only number system that is a member<br>
   of both the set of "conceptual mathematical <br>
   systems" and "the real world." Base 1 is the<br>
   intersection of the number engine of math and<br>
   the real world. 4 (b10) or 0100 (b2), or 10<br>
   (b4) must always mean this many things: 1111.<br>
