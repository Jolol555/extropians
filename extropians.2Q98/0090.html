<i>        &gt;I was just pointing out the, what i think are, extensive         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;simmilarities between the current system and PPA based         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anarcho-capitalism as you described it </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
PPA's are profit motivated, Nations are power motivated. Nations have a  <br>
geographical location , PPA's do not. It's easy to change PPA's, it's not <br>
easy to change nations. PPA's membership is voluntary, Nation citizenship is <br>
not. PPA's settle differences with arbitration, Nations prefer force.  <br>
Nations claim powers individuals lack, PPA's don't. <br>

<i>        &gt;the current nation-states, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Please explain to me how a PPA consisting of 40 million Germans, even <br>
assuming they all decided for some reason to join the same one, would be <br>
powerful enough to kill 6 million Jews. Explain why even though it means <br>
their life the Jews would not be willing to pay a premium seven times as high <br>
as their German neighbors pay their PPA.<br>
                  <br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;By the way, last time I checked there were close to a billion         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Indians not 10 million                        </i><br>
       <br>
<i>        &gt;huh?  what's that got to do with the price of fish?  </i><br>
<p>
If you're an Indian fisherman and you think that big bad Bill Gates is out to  <br>
get you and that your 10 million member PPA is too small and weak to protect  <br>
you, then join a bigger stronger one.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;War is expensive for both sides.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes. <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Your PPA doesn't have to fight anyone if no other PPA tries to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"rescue you".           </i><br>
        <br>
Yes.                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And no other PPA will try          </i><br>
             <br>
No.             <br>
 <br>
<i>        &gt;because they know that your PPA gets a higher profit from you than         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;they would </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
So what? I don't know or care how much the psychotic PPA is extorting from <br>
you, it's completely irrelevant to me, all I need to know is that your money  <br>
is good and you want to buy my services at my going rate. I also know that if <br>
I let the psychotic PPA  get away with this outrageous behavior I will lose <br>
other customers. My fellow PPA owners agree with me completely and have <br>
offered to help.                <br>
