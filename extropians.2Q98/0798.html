   IAN: The power of a right idea properly presented is<br>
   more powerful than lots of money and The Powers That <br>
   Be that have it. Of course, the ability of bad ideas<br>
   to overcome good ideas by lots of money is still there.<br>
<p>
   One can show that the best case out of a set of cases<br>
   is that the Govt, the "The Power That Is," killed the <br>
   230 people found dead, and because it IS the best case<br>
   out of a set of cases, many people will believe it and <br>
   then the "power of a right idea" wins! But The Powers<br>
   That Be aren't going to take it sitting down.  Their <br>
   money can reach 1000x more people than the little guy<br>
   with the right idea, and with that extra power they <br>
   can pound the little guy into the ground with false<br>
   and misleading information. I know this first hand.<br>
<p>
   So it could be that Power CAN defeat right ideas.<br>
   BUT, I found that it was believing that that gave<br>
   the Power its power over me, since I tried to run<br>
   from the power, and that was a nearly fatal error.<br>
   I think that pessimism feeds and fulfills itself.<br>
   If you think all hope is lost, THEN it will be.<br>
