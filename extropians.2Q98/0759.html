 DF&gt; When I pay you for your labor, we BOTH benefit: I for receiving your<br>
 DF&gt; labor, you for receiving my payment.<br>
<p>
Yes, but I also suffer from having to actually /perform/ the labor.  Being a<br>
naturally lazy person, I find such a system distasteful.  :-)<br>
<p>
 DF&gt; Robots would be no different.<br>
 DF&gt; The argument that anyone could do our work and leave us WORSE off as<br>
 DF&gt; a result is dubious at best.<br>
<p>
It's not a choice between the work being done or not being done, it's a<br>
question of HOW.  Under the current system, you pay a laborer to do it.  Under<br>
the future system, you can lease a robot to do it.  You are paying for the<br>
same productive result either way, but in the first case you're paying someone<br>
to toil for you.  In the second case you're paying someone for the use of his<br>
capital (in the form of the robot).<br>
<p>
I prefer the second system, since it becomes less likely that I'll have to<br>
work for a living.  It is an opportunity to lift the burden of work from<br>
humanity, by making us all cyber-capitalists!<br>
<p>
Of course there is some precedent in history...  There was the unfortunate<br>
practice of human slavery.  I live in Texas, a state with the dubious<br>
distinction of having gone to war /twice/ in defense of slavery.  This leads<br>
to a certain degree of soul-searching.  If we ever attempt an economic system<br>
using robots in the place of slaves, we must be /damn/ sure of our ethical<br>
grounds before starting.  There must be a system in place to ensure that the<br>
robots -- no matter how versatile and competent they might become -- are<br>
always in FACT soulless and emotionless automatons incapable of either<br>
desiring or appreciating freedom.<br>
