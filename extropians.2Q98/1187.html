From: ChuckKuecker &lt;ckuecker@mcs.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;OH, come on! Every engineer knows, the</i><br>
true god (devil??) is named Murphy,<br>
<i>&gt;and is a redheaded Irishman. His laws</i><br>
govern the cosmos.<br>
<p>
<p>
Indeed, Murphy's Law reigns up there<br>
with Catch-22. Perhaps you've also heard<br>
of Belefant's Law, which states: You<br>
can't do anything without having to do<br>
something else first.<br>
<p>
To illustrate, I submit the following:<br>
<p>
It starts simply. The other day the<br>
lights in our house flickered, and<br>
finally half went out. Knowing something<br>
about electricity, I ascertained that<br>
power to one leg of our 220-volt service<br>
was gone.<br>
<p>
Complete power failure on one leg<br>
usually indicates a power supply<br>
problem, so I called the power company.<br>
They said they had no recorded power<br>
outages in my area so they would sent<br>
out a crew. The crew came, verified the<br>
outage and said they would trace it back<br>
to see if it was a power company failure<br>
or a problem in the house wiring.<br>
<p>
the connection point between the power<br>
company's responsibility is the meter<br>
box. The power company crew opened the<br>
meter box removed the meter to check<br>
forward and backward from that point. In<br>
order to check the lines they had to<br>
access the meter terminals. Upon<br>
examination they said that the meter<br>
terminals in the box were corroded and a<br>
check was impossible until the box and<br>
terminals were replaced.<br>
<p>
GETS WORSE... I contacted an electrician<br>
to replace the box, and the power<br>
company crew waited until the<br>
electrician who does much of my<br>
electrical work arrived. He looked at<br>
the meter box and the power company crew<br>
and said that only specifically licensed<br>
electricians are allowed to work on<br>
meter boxes. He gave me the name of a<br>
qualified electrician and left.<br>
<p>
The second electrician came, looked at<br>
the box and said  the power company<br>
would have to turn off the power at the<br>
transformer so that he could work. The<br>
power company crew chief went to turn<br>
off the power at the transformer. He<br>
walked over to the pole that held the<br>
transformer, looked up, and said "uh<br>
oh!" I knew we were in deep doo-doo.<br>
<p>
FROM SUBLIME TO RIDICULOUS... The crew<br>
chief went on to explain that because<br>
the lightning arrester support has<br>
corroded, the lightning arrester would<br>
have to be fixed in place before he<br>
could turn off the power. Furthermore,<br>
his truck with a "cherry picker" was too<br>
small -- he would have to call for a<br>
bigger truck and another crew.<br>
<p>
The bigger truck, with another crew,<br>
arrived. The crew decided that some<br>
trees would have to be trimmed for<br>
access to the pole. A tree trimming crew<br>
was called.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, the electrician said that he<br>
couldn't replace the meter box until he<br>
got a permit from the town's building<br>
official. As it was an emergency, he<br>
thought he could get it immediately, and<br>
off he went.<br>
<p>
...AND BEYOND. After the trees were<br>
properly trimmed, the big truck's crew<br>
found that the only way they could get<br>
to the lightning arrester with their<br>
"cherry picker" was to park the truck in<br>
the street. The street is a main artery,<br>
so the police had to be called to block<br>
and divert traffic. It began to look<br>
like an IEEE convention. Finally,<br>
traffic was diverted, the trees were<br>
trimmed, the lightning arrester fixed,<br>
the power turned off, the meter and<br>
meter box replaced, the power was turned<br>
back on, and the lights in my house<br>
worked. It took all day, two town<br>
agencies, three power company crews, two<br>
electricians, and more than a dozen men<br>
to do it, but I felt lucky. It didn't<br>
rain.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
