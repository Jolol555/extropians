&lt; These days, it seems like most academia has all but<br>

contracts when a text has infinite meaning. &gt;<br>
<p>
Dan also noted the blind hostility towards capitalism<br>
in academia. Ian Goddard responded with a 1961<br>
Eisenhower quote about how, for some academics "a<br>
government contract becomes virtually a substitute<br>
for intellectual curiosity".<br>
<p>
Or, it becomes a blank check to endlessly explore<br>
artistic, sexual and social fetishes at public<br>
expense.   Here's another quote in the same spirit<br>
that I just saw today:<br>
<p>
"When plunder has become a way of life for a group of<br>
men living together in society, they create for<br>
themselves in the course of time a legal system that<br>
authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."<br>
-Frederic Bastiat, "The Physiology of Plunder", p.<br>
130, _Economic Sophisms_<br>
<p>
The plunder, in this case, is by tenured academics<br>
still fantasizing about the failed revolutions of<br>
their youth, the Utopia that was 'betrayed' by greedy<br>
market Reality.  Perhaps a few years from now a new<br>
crop of more hard-science libertarian academics will<br>
still be telling their students how the Singularity<br>
was 'betrayed' by quaint cultural and ecological<br>
concerns.<br>
<p>
Still, it's possibly an Objectivist red herring to<br>
characterize this as "hostility to truth", to suggest<br>
that hermeneutics implies that a text really has<br>
*infinite* meanings, or to equate all<br>
post-structuralist thinking with the antics of some<br>
jeering court jesters.  It's just the public-goods<br>
market in evolution.<br>
