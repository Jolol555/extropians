JPL has now released a processed image of the Face on Mars.  The camera<br>
aiming turned out to be accurate, and the image is detailed and clear.<br>
Lighting is from the opposite side than in the existing pictures, and<br>
that, plus the higher resolution, shows the Face in a whole new light.<br>
<p>
It looks nothing like a face.<br>
<p>
In fact, at first glance one's impression is that JPL has goofed and<br>
identified the wrong thing.  But there is a crater to the left of the<br>
face which is visible in the new image as well, in the same geometric<br>
relationship.  Clearly this is the same object we have known as the Face.<br>
<p>
It is a fissured, eroded hill, nothing more.<br>
