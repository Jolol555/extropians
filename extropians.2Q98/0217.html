Banks Unite For Global Year 2000 Efforts<br>
(04/09/98; 1:36 p.m. EST)<br>
By Hakhi Alakhun El, InformationWeek  <br>
 <br>
A group of major banking institutions announced Wednesday an initiative to<br>
keep the year 2000 problem from severely impacting world financial markets.<br>
The group, which includes Citicorp, Barclay's Bank, Deutsche Bank, Bank of<br>
Tokyo, and Hong Kong Bank, said it is planning to organize common year 2000<br>
guidelines to be shared throughout the industry by managers and regulators.<br>
<p>
In a statement, the organization, called the Global 2000 Coordinating<br>
Group, said it plans to compile the year 2000 status of countries, cities,<br>
and businesses. It will also examine cash-payment systems, securities<br>
clearance and custody systems, stocks, bond futures, commodity exchanges,<br>
foreign currency exchanges, and derivative trading.<br>
<p>
In addition, the group will look at the readiness of organizations and<br>
industries that are linked to the economic infrastructure such as utilities<br>
(electricity, water, and telecommunications companies) and transportation<br>
industries. <br>
