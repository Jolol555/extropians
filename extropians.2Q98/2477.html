            <br>
<p>
I think the idea that we live in the best of all possible worlds is a <br>
profoundly depressing thought, I'd hate to think it's true.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;what if we lived in a globular cluster, so that the nearest stars </i><br>
<i>        &gt;were only a few light days away, </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
The heavier elements are made in supernova explosions but globular clusters <br>
are made up of population one stars that are very old and created out of the <br>
original stuff from the Big Bang, so most metals vital for a technological <br>
civilization like iron, copper, tin and uranium would be virtually nonexistent <br>
in them. Even carbon would be rare making life in globular clusters doubtful. <br>
<p>
Another problem is that we would be ignorant of the larger universe, <br>
everything would be so crowded together we'd only be able to see things a <br>
few hundred light years away and we'd think that was the entire universe.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and the home planet had a low gravity field?</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
A planet much smaller than the Earth couldn't hold on to a substantial <br>
atmospheric. A planet much larger than the Earth would be able to retain so <br>
much of the primordial hydrogen that was common during its formation that <br>
free oxygen would be impossible.                  <br>
