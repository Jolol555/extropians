Erik Moeller &lt;flagg@oberberg-online.de&gt; so wisely spake unto us:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Good grief, a baseball team holds regular meet-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  ings, and may even have a set of principles,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  so is a baseball team a religion and thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  a cult?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the baseball team claims that the ball must be covered with red goo to</i><br>
<i>&gt; fly well, and it does so without any evidence, yeah, then the last</i><br>
missing<br>
<i>&gt; feature for it to be a cult, the religious belief in something without</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence, is fulfilled.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your red goos are individual freedom, free marketship and extropy.</i><br>
<p>
Ever time I have seen you try to attack free markets with any sort of logic<br>
or empirical evidence, that logic and evidence is flawlessy refuted by<br>
members of this list,(eg. John Clark, Lee Daniel Crocker, Anton Sherwood)<br>
who cite a larger body of contradictory evidence and well-thought-out logic<br>
which supports the benefits of a free market.  <br>
<p>
Let me put it in a baseball analogy for better comprehension:  Most of the<br>
people on No-Goo Baseball List(created specifically to discuss baseballs<br>
without red goo, under the recognized *assumption* that red goo is bad)<br>
think that a baseball will fly the best without red goo.  This idea comes<br>
from scientific research, practical experience, and the fact that whenever<br>
a red goo supporter comes on to the list, all his points are easily and<br>
completely rebutted.  You come along, telling everyone that playing or even<br>
thinking about playing without red goo is not only in error, but bordering<br>
on fascism.  You drop a couple book names (maybe Noam Chomsky is a linguist<br>
and a baseball player?), give some vague evidence about how un-gooed balls<br>
are morally repugnant, and throw out a bunch of red-goo propaganda that has<br>
been heard by everyone on the list a million times over.  Your points are<br>
destroyed by evidence, yet you consistently claim that *everyone else* is<br>
faithful to un-gooey balls, that this belief is not supported by evidence,<br>
and that you are doing everyone a favour by revealing<br>
non-gooey-baseball-supporters as cult-members.  You also accuse the creator<br>
of the Extropian No-Goo Baseball List of being a cult leader because he<br>
created a list that does not involve talking about red goo, and because<br>
*some* people on the list have opinions on red goo that contradict yours.  <br>
<p>
Do you really think anyone is going to take you seriously using a strategy<br>
such as this? (beside playing silly logic games with your posts ;-)  What<br>
are you trying to acheive?<br>
<p>
IMHO, the only thing you are achieving here is wasting everyone's time by<br>
throwing out a statement like "you all belong to a cult" to a bunch of<br>
anti-cultists,(who are justifiably perturbed by such a negative label) then<br>
not backing it up with any evidence, or contorting the meaning of cult<br>
until it basically describes every philosophy ever postulated, including<br>
yours.<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
<p>
Geoff.<br>
