<p>
I was a later-born with three older siblings and one much younger.  The<br>
stress level was a bit high during my developmental years into early<br>
adulthood due to the competitive nature of my older siblings and expected<br>
elevated creativity.  Being from a family of artists and scientists<br>
(medical doctors and engineers), I felt most pressure coming from the need<br>
to keep up and be unique.<br>
<p>
My family put emphasis on creative ideas (father's influence) and<br>
development of many female friendships (mother's influence).  In that most<br>
of my influence comes from the combination of both, I (being on the<br>
youngest-end) had to prove myself beyond the family norm.  I was often<br>
teased and left out of things which resulted in my inner search and<br>
personal exploration.<br>
<p>
Being a later-born, I was able to watch and digest the actions of my older<br>
siblings, learning from their interactions in the world.  Because my<br>
sister's proclamation that she never wanted me to be born, I made it my<br>
quest to seek out non-biological "sisters" -- procuring and nurturing my<br>
many relationships with women.  Because of my families obvious and open<br>
support of the male siblings, I worked harder to prove that females were as<br>
capable as the males.  A situation that riddles me to this date.<br>
<p>
Thus, my creativeness stems from having to keep up and prove myself early<br>
on and a desire to combine art and science while paying very special<br>
attention to my own femininity and the support from and giving to friends.<br>
I struggle with anxiety and have learned behavioral methods to tone it<br>
down.  I am not innately relaxed, but practice it as a way of finding a<br>
"zen-like" quality in my life.  (Meditation, creative visualization and<br>
exercise.)  I'm not always successful at it, but recognize it as being a<br>
useful tool to letting my unconscious flow.<br>
