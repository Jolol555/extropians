<i>&gt;As for why my definition is better than your three laws?  I posit that</i><br>

<i>&gt;1) A is A.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2) A is not both A and not-A with respect to 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3) A is either A or not-A with respect to 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<p>
   IAN: Why not add "with respect to 0" to 1?<br>
   2 and 3 are holist in nature since they say<br>
   that what A is depends upon something that <br>
   A is not, and thus they are not atomist.<br>
<p>
   I agree that half of the difference is <br>
   half of the difference, and half defines<br>
   the whole by default. If I give you $50 <br>
   and say this is half of the fee, the<br>
   identity of the whole fee is revealed,<br>
   so the ID of the whole is in the half.<br>
<p>
   The area just outside the letter A defines <br>
   it as much as the area inside the letter.<br>
   Its identity contains both areas.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why is my definition better?  My definition is better because it is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;one most people use.  "Atomism" means whatever people use it to mean, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;they happen to use it to mean that A is either A or not-A and not both</i><br>
<i>&gt;with respect to 0. The omission of "with respect to 0" from your statement</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the laws is trivial: </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: It's really not true to say that I omitted<br>
   the portion that you added to the Three Laws since<br>
   they've never been published your way. Your version<br>
   is holistic, since adding "with respect to" includes<br>
   a relation. It's clear that you've changed the defin-<br>
   tion of atomism to a holistic definition, but kept the<br>
   "atomist" label on it, for what reason I know not, ex-<br>
   cept to be able to say you've evidenced atomism.<br>
<p>
   Isn't that proving how effective product A is in a <br>
   demonstration using product H with an A label on it,<br>
   or more exactly, by using a mix of 2/3 H and 1/3 A?<br>
<p>
   You said I was confusing definitions, but your changing<br>
   the definitions of atomism is the only confusion I see.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;it is implicit in everything that we do or say that we are </i><br>
<i>&gt;always referring to the partial difference, and never the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"whole" difference, when we talk about difference. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: When I refer to the high, I refer to <br>
   the low by default;  when I refer to the <br>
   good, I refer to the bad by default...<br>
 <br>
   How is it that I don't refer to the whole?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;No one defines "difference" the way you define</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference, Ian, and that's all there is to it.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Not true. "Net difference" is not a <br>
   violation of the definition of difference.<br>
   I say that the difference between 4 and <br>
   5 is expressed as 4 - 5 = -1. That's the<br>
   standard definition. So saying that the <br>
   net difference is -1 &amp; 1, is not unique;<br>
   observing that it is the holisitc struc-<br>
   ture of identity is unique.<br>
<p>
   What seems to be demolished in your <br>
   analysis is any difference between <br>
   atomism and holism, for to sustain<br>
   atomism you've changed it to holism.<br>
