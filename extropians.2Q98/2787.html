<i>&gt;  &gt; and an observation which I would greatly appreciate comments on.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; An interesting project, I'm looking forward to the summary.</i><br>
<p>
"How to use the internet: a practical guide to intelligence amplification" <br>
or a similarly titled document will be linked to on my home page <br>
(currently <a href="http://wwwcas.phys.unm.edu/~mnielsen/">http://wwwcas.phys.unm.edu/~mnielsen/</a>), probably by September. <br>
I'll post a link when it's available.<br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; What are your most effective sources of information on the internet?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Documents, and people. People spontaneously segregate in virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt; locations, and generate interesting informations streams both</i><br>
<i>&gt; spontaneously, and upon cues. Of course you have to pay for these</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources in the same coin.</i><br>
<p>
There is an interesting anthropology or economics PhD waiting to be done on <br>
asymmetry and altruism in information flows.  Why some people act as <br>
information sinks, while others are sources, and what are the economics <br>
of the exchanges which take place. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; How did you find those sources?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; By word of mouth, hotlinks and search engines.</i><br>
<p>
Generically, I'm finding personal homepages a tremendously useful source <br>
of links.  Search engines are useful, but they rely almost completely on <br>
my intelligence.  With other people's homepages, I get access to a <br>
distilled form of their intelligence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; How do you make use of those sources?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally I scan the email, crosspost relevant items to several</i><br>
<i>&gt; persons/mailing lists. The big problem remains mail management.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting observation.  A project at present is to develop a nice Perl <br>
filter program for my email.  This works several ways. I can send myself <br>
messages, which results in actions being performed (example: I can send <br>
myself a list of words which need defining; my filter program then <br>
retrieves definitions from online sources, and puts the relevant <br>
definitions in my inbox); the other desirable goal is to organize my <br>
incoming mail much more efficiently.  A lot will be auto-junked; the rest <br>
ought to be sorted and backlinked to other relevant documents.  Scoring <br>
email would also be useful.  Unfortunately, only some of these ideas are <br>
implementable within my current set-up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I read the documents on the web, in the last time frequently abusing </i><br>
<i>&gt; the local <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a> mirror. Let's hope similiar services</i><br>
<i>&gt; will spring up for other fields, I'm missing this particularly for</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemistry and biosciences.</i><br>
<p>
It's gradually happening. NSF is funding xxx, and they are expanding <br>
their coverage slowly into other fields.  I'm hoping that more filter <br>
sites like Daniel Gottesman's <br>
(<a href="http://qso.lanl.gov/~gottesma/qcreviews/main.html">http://qso.lanl.gov/~gottesma/qcreviews/main.html</a>) will appear over time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Researcher's pages are very useful, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes hard to find.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Incidentally, see <br>
<a href="http://wwwcas.phys.unm.edu/~mnielsen/info/info.html">http://wwwcas.phys.unm.edu/~mnielsen/info/info.html</a> for links to the home <br>
pages of many researchers in quantum computing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; It strikes me that a very well-thought out document "How to use the net", </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; along the lines of Mortimer Adler's "How to read a book" would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Apropos books: my next project is OCRing my entire library, book by</i><br>
<i>&gt; book, and digest my CD collection into mp3. Ideally, these should live </i><br>
<i>&gt; in a wearable computer. <a href="http://www.netwinder.org">http://www.netwinder.org</a> seems like a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; starting point for a conversion. Particularly built-in networking and</i><br>
<i>&gt; IrDA make it sound ideal for hot-synching with the home unit.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting project. There is an excellent repository of on-line books at <br>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/books.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/books.html</a>.  The Library of Congress also has some <br>
superb online sources (<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/">http://lcweb.loc.gov/</a>).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, this has become unfocused/ranty. No time to fix it up, gotta</i><br>
<i>&gt; run.</i><br>
<p>
I found it most useful. Thankyou.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
