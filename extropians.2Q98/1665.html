transactions<br>

others<br>

Retail will not die for a long time. You will find it difficult to email<br>
fried chicken, for example. Until there is no more need for transportation<br>
for people to go places, there will still be stores to cater to them. It's<br>
lots more fun to shop in person, anyway. For retail to die out, we must<br>
postulater a worls where no one leaves their homes..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If people are unemployed through increasing automation, how will they support</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves?</i><br>
<p>
If automation reaches the ultimate level of 'replicators' there will be no<br>
reason to support oneself. You can go back to the 'hunter/gatherer' level<br>
of life, since there will be anything you want available for the taking.<br>
This excludes land, unless we get cheap space transport. Land will be the<br>
only thing in short supply.<br>
<p>
Yes, I am postulating a 'free' energy source, and I am also not projecting<br>
beyond the next 100 years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, if the millions of people being automated out of the retail</i><br>
sector do<br>
<i>&gt;find other jobs, what what might those jobs be?  Assuming there is a</i><br>
market for<br>
<i>&gt;them, can you say in all honesty that they *all* have the aptitude to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientists, artists, designers, or engineers?  If not, then what will they</i><br>
do to<br>
<i>&gt;support themselves?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
With universal automation, the point is that there will be no need for most<br>
of today's jobs. If you can get anything you want for free, why do you need<br>
to make a living?<br>
<p>
I think the bigger problem will be keeping the masses of displaced people<br>
content with their lives..<br>
Many will spend their entire lives in VR, living their dreams. No different<br>
than losing oneself in a novel today, except in the future we will be able<br>
to do it forever, if desired.<br>
<p>
The transition form today's society to the future is a problem that must be<br>
addressed. I am still puzzling on that..<br>
