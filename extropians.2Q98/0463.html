How about a grown-up version of the ballistic parachute gaining in<br>
popularity in the small plane market? Three or four fairly large 'chutes<br>
would add little weight to the plane, and could bring it down fairly<br>
gently...these could also include drogues to decelerate the craft to a safe<br>
speed for deployment..<br>
<p>
Again, not a panacea, but it could save some lives in some circumstances.<br>
