<p>
Lifespan increases trough better technlogy, better technology also makes<br>
safer cars and airplanes and such. I would suspect that things like cancer<br>
would be the primary cause of death in the (near) future. or Smoking.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Eventually, the</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;chance of dying in a car accident or plane crash will become quite</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;significant. Approximately one in 2 million flights go down. That means</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;that if you make only 100 flights in your life, the chance is one in</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;20,000 that one of the planes will go down - that's way "better" than</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;the lottery.</i><br>
<p>
But not as good as heart faillure, cancer or breaking your neck in the<br>
bathroom.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;I saw a rather horrifying TV program recently called "Why</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;planes go down". Human error is by far the major reason. Anyway, there</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;was one crash in which one of the engines blew out, and the pilots had</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;to land the plane as best they could. Even though they had 1/2 hour to</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;get the plane down, something like 150 people died. A rather obvious</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;question is "why do airlines not make parachutes available to</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;passengers." Admitedly, there are some incidents where you have _no_</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;time to save anybody, but sometimes there _is_ time to bail out. It may</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;seem like a naive question, but I would appreciate people's opinions.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;If the parachutes could be made sufficiently automatic so as to require NO</i><br>
<i> &gt;user interaction, and the aircraft could be equipped with a door openable in</i><br>
<i> &gt;the air (old 727's come to mind, and DC-8's?) this could become a reality.</i><br>
<i> &gt;If the airlines see the same public relations benefit to this that they see</i><br>
<i> &gt;in putting defibrillators on board, they might do it without governmental</i><br>
<i> &gt;prodding.</i><br>
<p>
Of course one must not panic, you know, remember to pull that cord and<br>
stuff. Considering the way most people behave during situations a lot less<br>
stressful (a small traffic accident) I would not bet on this saving many<br>
lives. Better to spend the money elsewhere. Improving the planes and better<br>
training of the pilots (maybe even more pilots per plane). The most<br>
dangerous part of any plane-trip is the car-ride to the airfield.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The biggest problem I see is how do you control landing? Coming down in an</i><br>
<i> &gt;urban area, on power lines, in water, etc...</i><br>
<p>
Even if there's a nice meadow you can still break quite a few bones<br>
(including but not limited to your neck) if you have no training in<br>
para-jumping.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;Personally, I wish I did have access to a 'chute when I fly. Trusting my</i><br>
<i> &gt;safety to a machine of unknown maintainance history, operated by persons of</i><br>
<i> &gt;whom I have no knowledge of their abilities and mindset, always makes me</i><br>
<i> &gt;quite nervous..</i><br>
<p>
That's a healty attitute, but where do you find the time to check-up on<br>
your local Nuclear powerplant, ICBM-silo's in Kazakstan or the factory that<br>
produces the packaging of your dairy products? ;-)<br>
<p>
Stay out of the sun. Don't smoke. Don't drink, Don't have unsafe sex, Mind<br>
your diet. Live outside a city. Don't do dangerous sports. You'll be bore<br>
but alive ;-)<br>
