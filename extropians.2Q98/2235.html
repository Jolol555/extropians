<i>&gt; whatsoever?</i><br>
<p>
No special vulnerabilities specific to this method.  However, no method is<br>
foolproof.  Let me point out the obvious problems with using this method in the<br>
real world.<br>
<p>
1.  The participants don't know who their talking to, so you can't contact a<br>
specific individual.  The unknown individual could be the enemy you are trying<br>
to hide messages from.<br>
<p>
2.  This is only as secure as the anonymous remailer.  All people with access<br>
to that machine could trace the messages to a real e-mail address.  If someone<br>
hacks into that machine, they can do the same.  If a government pressures the<br>
owner, they may provide the information to the government.<br>
<p>
3.  This is only secure as the key exchange.  If you never meet the person, and<br>
you never exchange keys in a secure medium, then the key exchange can be<br>
spoofed.  Say you contact me as an anonymous person.  Instead of replying to<br>
you, I can reencrypt it and send it to a third party as if it came from you.  I<br>
get their response, reencrypt it back to you.  You and the third party think<br>
you have met and are having a secure conversation as you described above. <br>
Neither of would know that I am reading all of your encrypted messages back and<br>
forth.<br>
<p>
4.  The internet is not secure.  Even with anonymous remailers and encryption,<br>
I might be able to detect clues about who is talking to whom.  For example, the<br>
timing and scheduling of your messages to the remailer might let me detect<br>
similar sized and schedule messages from the remailer to your target.  If you<br>
are the only person to send three 100K e-mails today to the remailer, and then<br>
I see another person receive three 10K e-mails from the remailer later that<br>
night, then I can figure out who your anonymous e-mail is really going to.  I<br>
don't need to hack the remailer or either of your computers.  I only need to<br>
monitor Internet traffic.<br>
<p>
5.  PGP keys are only as secure as your machine and your passphrase. <br>
Encryption keys are typically stored in computer hardware.  If someone can hack<br>
into your machine, or if they take physical possession of your machine, then<br>
they have your decryption key.   If somebody can break down your door and take<br>
your PC, then they can take your decryption key.  If somebody can hack through<br>
your Browser to see your hard disk, then they can take your decryption key.<br>
<p>
6.  Encryption does not prevent decoding, it only slows it down.  Faster<br>
computers may be able to crack it.  New methods are being invented all the<br>
time.  Remember that most "uncrackable" codes are later cracked with new<br>
technology or methods.  Just because it seems uncrackable to you, or seems<br>
uncrackable now, doesn't mean that it will remain uncrackable indefinitely.<br>
<p>
Sorry if these are obvious points.  Any security specialist will respond with<br>
methods to counter these.  Don't use the Internet, have your PC self destruct<br>
if physically moved, don't trust anonymous remailers, don't store your key on<br>
your computer, etc.  If you aren't this paranoid, then the method you describe<br>
is not as foolproof as it may seem, due to other methods not directly related<br>
to cracking the encryption.<br>
