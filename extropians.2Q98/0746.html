<i>&gt; &gt; A few years ago I had an idea for my very own work of art which I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yet to act on.  Commonly the value of art is directly associated with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; its rarity.  So I propose (assuming I'm not too late) a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Network Art" which increases in value when it increases in ubiquity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (like all good networks).  I propose this as a sort of play on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; popular definition of what makes art "valuable" and a homage to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; network age.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A fascinating idea. What about running it as a distributed</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary system where each node allows users to breed new</i><br>
<i>&gt; artworks, which then diffuse to appear at other nodes or become part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the art produced there? The more people who used the system the</i><br>
<i>&gt; more diversity and computer power there would be. One could even have</i><br>
<i>&gt; slightly different nodes, some where one creates 3D objects a la</i><br>
<i>&gt; Latham and some that produce 2D art (which can be used as textures for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 3D stuff) and so on.</i><br>
<p>
That's quite an interesting thing. I've been thinking about putting up<br>
that sort of thing with a friend, but it's way too much work to do with<br>
only 2 or so people.<br>
<p>
The idea was to create a virtual world, which could could be transmitted<br>
through VRML (on the internet, "how" you see it depends on the browser),<br>
HMDs or even CAVEs (imagine a bar with only the most simple functional<br>
interior - the environment is rendered). All kinds of different artists<br>
could work on 2d and 3d-Designs as well as sound-environments (music,<br>
different sorts of atmospheric noises etc.) The most important thing<br>
about it is that everything needs to be linked smartly. For example,<br>
there could be some sort of 2d-FX-show (like cthuga, which inspired that<br>
whole idea). Now, you can either project that upon a screen in 2d - OR<br>
use it as a texture in a 3d-world. Same thing with sound: there could be<br>
some techno-trax for a certain "world", which for example are modulated<br>
by certain events of the interactive objects - but the same thing could<br>
be transmitted to a club with just a fancy light-show.<br>
<p>
Most most important (I almost forgot, but it's obvious from the<br>
context): the whole thing needs to be networked. Let's say we have that<br>
CAVE-Bar, which is linked to the Internet via VRML, as well as to some<br>
CAVE-Club, maybe in another country, and also some VR-Studio on still<br>
another place. Now, each entity has a "location" within some virtual<br>
space, a "location" consists of<br>
a) The actual "world"<br>
b) The position within that world<br>
<p>
Worlds could be logically hyperlinked (like, there could be a exits at a<br>
world, which lets you chose where you want to go next, or certain exits<br>
lead to do determined other worlds). Whenever two real world entities<br>
(for example someone browsing the VRML-Space and the VR-Studio), there<br>
should be ways of interaction. For example, if you modify certain<br>
objects within the world, this should be visible to all other<br>
"visitors", or, you could actually SEE the visitors (via avatars or with<br>
real-video mapped into screens or whatever within the world) and<br>
communicate...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The problem comes with putting this idea into practise.</i><br>
<p>
That was our major problem, too... one would have to start little by<br>
little, but always keeping the "big goal" in mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; easy to network over the Internet and/or running it on a computer, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would rather it retain some ties with "traditional" works of art.</i><br>
<p>
I'd like to see "ties" with the party-scene ;-)<br>

later,<br>
