<i>&gt; From: The SHO master c.c. &lt;98097@sh.dc.k12.mn.us&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am curious if it is in the extropian intrest to recruit new </i><br>
<i>&gt; members?</i><br>
<p>
For the time being, yes. Any "movement" needs money and people<br>
to operate. Of course, if too many (millions?) people joined it might <br>
become a bureaucratic monolith, but I don't see this happening anytime <br>
soon.<br>
<p>
Btw, it might be a good idea to accept that transhumanism, just like<br>
cryonics for example, is for the enlightened few. Of course some<br>
preaching (in order to win souls) to the outside world is great, and<br>
even necessary to keep the membership steady, but it may also<br>
be a good idea to "turn inwards", and make things more worthwile for<br>
the people you already have. Transhuman institutions like ExI<br>
(or one specially created for this purpose) could offer more tangible<br>
benefits to their members, or rather the members to eachother.<br>
<p>
For example, now everyone has to more or less figure out for himself<br>
what he can do to fully use today's technological potential. That is<br>
hardly efficient. It would be good to have an easy-to-use, frequently<br>
updated database where the best of all fields is registered, described<br>
and recommended. From this database a program could be made<br>
that members can take to become more efficient (like, dare I say it,<br>
scientology has, only based on more enlightened principles). If<br>
you can effectively make people "healthy, wealthy and wise" (and<br>
immortal while you're at it) there should be a reasonable rise in <br>
membership. A good product sells itself. Strengtening the internal <br>
ties also helps: many folks are looking for a substitute family, and <br>
therefore join a cult. Now instead of taking their money and turning<br>
them into zombies you could make them into successful individuals,<br>
who might help to spread the word and otherwise support the cause<br>
(the ultimate cause of this mutual aid group could be to give every <br>
member an optimal starting position when the singularity hits, <br>
increasing the chances of survival.) <br>
<p>
The above is a proven formula: just about any successful religion, cult <br>
and political movement started out as a mutual aid group of people<br>
with a clear common goal, that could operate with or without the approval <br>
of the outside world. Right now it's a bit of a neither fish nor fowl situation,<br>
transhumanists/extropians/cryonicists being regarded as a freaky "cult", <br>
but not having a cult's benefits.<br>
