<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Your definition is new and IS properly defined</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as "your definition," which redefines atomism</i><br>
<i>&gt;   in a holist context by adding "with respect to."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   You're REdefining the standard then you're </i><br>

<i>&gt;   people use. That is the opposite of the truth.</i><br>
<p>
You assert, then, that most people use YOUR definition and not mine?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The 3 Laws define a crisp boundary around A</i><br>
<i>&gt;   that says the identity of A is exclusive to A</i><br>
<i>&gt;   by 100%. Adding to A is A "with respect to 0"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   turns atomism into a holistic relation.</i><br>
<p>
So, let me get this straight:  The 3 Laws are the right definition, and<br>
therefore my definition is wrong. <br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; It's hopeless, Ian.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   That such relation is the truth does not mean it </i><br>
<i>&gt;   is atomism. You've assumed "atomism" = "truth."</i><br>
<p>
No.  I'm simply asserting what most everyone ELSE knew already: that all<br>
"atomist" Newtonians agree that nothing is defined without a frame of<br>
reference, but that within a frame of reference, properties can vary<br>
independently.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   That you attempt to show examples of relations </i><br>
<i>&gt;   that are what they are free from other relations,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   means your saying that relation-A is A free from</i><br>
<i>&gt;   -A, and thus you still deploy the very traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;   atomist definition that you seek to redefine.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly.  To rephrase it in terms of holism, using the partial difference<br>
between A-0 and B-0 allows us to derive the rest of the identity chart; we<br>
lose no information by describing identity in terms of this relation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: You'll know it still by its relation to external </i><br>
<i>&gt;   features. Your trying to say that A is A free from </i><br>
<i>&gt;   not-A even as you try to redefine atomism not to </i><br>
<i>&gt;   say that. Just ask yourself, why is it necessary </i><br>
<i>&gt;   for you to add the words "with respect to 0" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the 3 Laws? What do they change? What do they stop?</i><br>
<i>&gt;   They stop the clearly stated definition of atomism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the definition that you continue to attempt to use</i><br>
<i>&gt;   by arguing that relation-A is A free from -A.</i><br>
<p>
A is NOT free from not-A.  You can't have an A free from at least one<br>
other thing: in this case, 0.  However, you can have A free from B, if we<br>
define identity as the relation between A and 0.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: Then 1 also has no identity because </i><br>
<i>&gt;    there is no difference between 1 and 1.</i><br>
<p>
Not unless you're defining your universe with respect to 1.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: Your redefining atomism to be holism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    A relation is a holism. A universe with 3 </i><br>
<i>&gt;    things defines 1 thing as 1 of 3. I've </i><br>
<i>&gt;    already shown how your example of two </i><br>
<i>&gt;    things relating to zero is holism by </i><br>
<i>&gt;    100% since the changing relation was </i><br>
<i>&gt;    change relative to the not-change.</i><br>
<p>
Of COURSE it's holism.  I'm arguing that atomism IS holism.  You<br>
persistently argue that my definition of atomism is not atomism because it<br>
is holism.  I KNOW it's holism; that doesn't prove that it's not atomism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: A may be larger, faster,... than B, </i><br>
<i>&gt;    and yes, all with respect to 0. Just observe</i><br>
<i>&gt;    that 3 is 5 relative to -2 and we see that </i><br>
<i>&gt;    non-zero identities acquire identity attributes</i><br>
<i>&gt;    from non-zero identities... as well as from 0.</i><br>
<p>
Consider thinking of it this way:  When we say that 3 is 5 relative to -2,<br>
that means that we are saying that -2 is 0 relative to -2.  So the fact<br>
that 3 is 5 relative to -2 does not mean that 3 has an identity which<br>
comes from -2, but that 3 has an identity which comes from zero; when we<br>
change reference frames, -2 is the 0.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: But half is not free from the whole,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    and the cause of the half is the whole.</i><br>
<p>
So?  A can change relative to 0 independently from B relative to 0, and<br>
that's all I'm trying to prove.<br>
