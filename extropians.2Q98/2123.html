      Perhaps if John Clark took a bit longer to understand these <br>
      problems, he would have a better understanding of them.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I give a _physical_ explanation of Heisenberg's Uncertainty <br>
      principle, whereby I expressly demarcate the _physics_ of <br>
      Heisenberg's ideas from the observationalist/positivist religion:<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>

   <br>
<p>
    My assertion that we can retrodictively correct the 'observational' <br>
    'evidence' to the extent that we understand the underlying processes <br>
    and interactions is simply _true_ (we do it all the time), and I <br>
    cannot understand why John Clark should fail to grasp the point, <br>
    unless he doesn't _want_ to understand it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No you can not, not readily and not at all</i><br>

<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;Planck's constant is constant          </i><br>
        <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Wake up man --  it's a ratio!</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Could you please explain why a ratio can not be a constant.</i><br>
<p>
       I was hoping to get Christian to see the difference between a ratio <br>
       and an (alleged) Absolute property.  SR/GR simultaneously states <br>
       that there are no absolute properties, then tries to sneak in an <br>
       Absolute velocity of light.  It just doesn't work.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;     &gt;Not [the speed of light is constant] according to Richard Feynman</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Dead wrong, Richard Feynman never said anything that stupid in his life.       </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
      I have a hundred dollars that says that I can give you citation for <br>
      Feynman's saying exactly this, that photons can travel faster and <br>
      slower  than 'c'.  In QED.  Wanna play?  &gt;:-}<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Not according to observation.    </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A statement without a particle of fact. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
      We start with a uniform cubic space, say one metre along each edge.  <br>
      On the north side is a blue LED pointing south, and alongside it, a <br>
      photoelectric cell likewise aimed southwards.<br>
      <br>
      On the south side we have a red LED pointed north, and a northwardly <br>
      aimed photoelectric cell.  <br>
      <br>
      Our apparatus is rigged so that the red and the blue LEDs fire <br>
      simuultaneusly.  The photoelectric cells record the time of flight <br>
      of the red and the blue photons.<br>
      <br>
      Armed with this kit, we can do a timeslice-by-timeslice analysis of <br>
      the positions of the photons within the cube.  We can show <br>
      _conclusively_ that  -- for the photons to start where and when they <br>
      do, and end up when and where they do, the red photons MUST travel <br>
      at 2c relative to the blue photons.<br>
      <br>
      Your whole crumbling edifice rests upon the empty assertion that <br>
      simultaneity is impossible, and that we cannot establish a uniform <br>
      mapping of the photons' positions.  Yet we can, and do.  QED.<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     &gt;Neither Special nor General Relativity have given science or </i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;technology anything it didn't have anyway.      </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Spectacularly wrong.</i><br>
<p>
      So name six technologies critically (patentably) dependent on <br>
      Special and General Relativity.  You can't.  And don't hand out that <br>
      tired old 'GPS' nonsense -- NASA use CLASSICAL MECHANICS for all <br>
      navigational calculations.  e=mc^2 was derived classically 'way <br>
      before SR/GR, as every knowledgeable scholar in the field is (or <br>
      should be) aware.  'Black Holes' preceded GR by more than a hundred <br>
      years.<br>
<p>
      Just name six.  If you can.  Wanna bet?<br>
      <br>
      John, I know the relativistic religion is alluring.  But it's just <br>
      plain myth...  &gt;:-}<br>
