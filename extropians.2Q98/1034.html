Exactly!  We are already seeing a massive overproduction capacity in several<br>
sectors.  And although you may have not realized it, you have hinted at an<br>
answer.  If overproduction continues at its current pace, these companies will<br>
have to start giving their products away at obcenly low prices.  This already<br>
happened to the chagrin of DRAM manufacturers.  Look at the trouble they got<br>
in.<br>
