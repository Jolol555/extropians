<i>&gt;I don't agree.  I remember that government in the US used to be held in</i><br>
rather<br>
<i>&gt;hi regard.  In my observation the only people who hold government in high</i><br>
<i>&gt;regard now IS the government and not all of them.  I know some government</i><br>
<i>&gt;(state) employees personally and they are very cynical....it's just that</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;job is soooooo easy that they don't want to do anything else...that might</i><br>
<i>&gt;require some effort...so they don't quit.  But their consciousness hurts</i><br>
them<br>
<i>&gt;somewhat.</i><br>

Well, if the mass media is friendly towards government, people are. If the<br>
mass media is skeptical, people are skeptical. If the mass media says that<br>
the president must resign because he received a good blowjob, then the<br>
president *will* have to resign. People are a mirror of the media, media are<br>
a mirror of the people who make them. Informational feedback loops can cause<br>
problems, i.e. those who design the media content can in the end be victims<br>
of their own propaganda.<br>

Read Noam Chomsky, "Manufacturing Consent".<br>
