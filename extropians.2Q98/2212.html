I don't believe this is a correct explanation for why photons travel<br>
more slowly through matter than through empty space.  It has nothing to<br>
do with gravity, which would be inconceivably small at this scale.<br>
<p>
Rather, the photons interact with the electrons around the atom.<br>
In effect, the photons are constantly being absorbed and almost instantly<br>
re-emitted.  Phase and other state information is preserved, but the<br>
photons end up being slowed down.  Once the photon re-enters vacuum it<br>
is able to proceed unimpeded at c.<br>
<p>
It is possible to travel faster than photons within matter.  If a charged<br>
particle does so will it will be slowed down by the electrons and will<br>
emit Cherenkov radiation, something like a "sonic boom" but of light.<br>
