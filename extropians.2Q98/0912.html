I think it's more appropriate to look at it from the POV that "atheism"<br>
was defined as a reaction to "theism".  Since theism we've all agreed<br>
means "belief in a god", then atheism from this perspective would yield<br>
"absence of a belief in a god".  In other words, there's no reason to<br>
suspect that the original Greek was consulted when defining atheism.<br>
Think how little English would make sense if we had to trace the origins<br>
of each compound word back to it's etymological source!<br>
