<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You can still have an expanding universe even if it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; spatially infinite.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It just means that distant objects move apart, slowly at </i><br>
<i>&gt; first, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; faster and faster.</i><br>
<p>
It's been a loooong time since I exercised my astrophysical neurons, and<br>
this seems as good a time as any...<br>
<p>
Correct me if I'm wrong, doesn't the rate of change of the Hubble<br>
constant indicate a limit (i.e., the speed of light) at a distance of<br>
something like 15 billion light years?  If the universe were larger than<br>
that, anything beyond this point would have to be receding faster than<br>
light, in apparent contradiction with relativity.<br>
<p>
Also, I think the contraction and closure you're referring to are two<br>
different things.  A low-density universe may forever continue to expand<br>
and yet have a finite area.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose space were not expanding.  It is three dimensional, obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; (ignoring the "time dimension").  Would you demand that there exist a</i><br>
<i>&gt; four dimensional space in which the three dimensional one was </i><br>
<i>&gt; embedded,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to give it reality?  And would that four dimensional </i><br>
<i>&gt; space have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be part of a larger five dimensional space, which is itself part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a six dimensional one, and so on?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All this is conceivable, but is it really necessary?  I don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; think we need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to assume there are higher dimensional spaces in order to give ours</i><br>
<i>&gt; reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
At the macroscopic level of reality, four dimensions seem to provide the<br>
most useful model of spacetime.  I don't see why four dimensions<br>
necessarily implies five or six.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even though our space is said to be "curved", and expanding, those</i><br>
<i>&gt; properties do not require higher dimensional spaces, either.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Curvature is</i><br>
<i>&gt; like a gradual internal warping of space, so that large </i><br>
<i>&gt; enough triangles</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't have angles that add to exactly 180 degrees.  It can be fully</i><br>
<i>&gt; described without reference to any larger embedding space.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Likewise the expansion of space can be expressed soley in terms of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; relations between objects within our universe.  There is no need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; postulate a higher dimensional universe which ours is part of.</i><br>
<p>
The "internal warping of space" you describe seems isomorphic to a<br>
four-dimensional spacetime, although the 4-D model provides (to me at<br>
least) an easier to understand picture of things.  Whether of not there<br>
really "is" a fourth dimension doesn't seem particularly important<br>
unless we're doing time travel.  4-D models would probably be the most<br>
useful if one were conducting large-scale engineering projects where an<br>
understanding of the spacetime topology were important, however.<br>
