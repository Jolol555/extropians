<i>&gt;Wow, as for the rest of your post, it is very well written and thought-out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, perhaps I'm missing a key element to your argument, but I somwhow</i><br>
missed<br>
<i>&gt;how it addresses the trend of increasing automation.  My concern will take</i><br>
some<br>
<i>&gt;explaining:</i><br>
<p>
I do understand this concern.  However, there's also lots of evidence that<br>
we should still see lots of humans in many different areas of production,<br>
even in the areas which you consider the most easily automatable.  It<br>
involves the theory of "comparative advantage," originally posited by David<br>
Ricardo.<br>
<p>
Suppose 10 robots could make 100 cars in a day or 100 supercomputers, where<br>
10 comparably equipped humans could make only 80 cars in a given day and 50<br>
supercomputers.  Obviously, the robots are better at making cars AND better<br>
at making supercomputers.  They have "absolute advantage" over humans.<br>
<p>
However, examine this from a different perspective.  If the humans decides<br>
to make 80 cars, they need sacrifice 50 supercomputers; they can make 1.6<br>
cars for every supercomputer they give up.  However, if robots decide to<br>
make 100 cars, they must sacrifice 100 supercomputers; they can only get 1<br>
car for every supercomputer.  What we see then is that the humans have<br>
COMPARATIVE advantage over the robots in making cars; the humans need<br>
sacrifice fewer computers to make more cars.  In contrast, the robots have<br>
comparative advantage over the humans in making supercomputers.<br>
<p>
To demonstrate this, let's see what happens when humans make only cars, and<br>
robots only make supercomputers.  Clearly, the robots and the humans will<br>
get 100 supercomputers and 80 cars.  Whereas if they tried it the other way<br>
around, society gets 100 cars and 50 supercomputers.<br>
<p>
What the theory of comparative advantage shows is that trade and<br>
specialization work to increase productivity, even if one producer has<br>
absolute advantage over the other.  While there is ample evidence to<br>
suggest that robots may have absolute advantage over us in all goods and<br>
services (maybe even in programming themselves!), it is profoundly unlikely<br>
that they will have comparative advantage over us in all goods.  So we will<br>
specialize in the goods in which humans have comparative advantage, and<br>
sell them to the robots.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1) The Retail Sector:  </i><br>
<i>&gt;2) The Service sector </i><br>
<i>&gt;3) Industrial Workers</i><br>
<p>
Also, remember that the jobs aren't vanishing per se, but rather that the<br>
wages are falling.  And what I think you're overlooking here is the<br>
trade-off here between falling wages and falling prices.  Wages are getting<br>
lower and lower, but they are able to buy more and more.  So long as wages<br>
aren't falling faster than the price level, we should be fine.<br>
<p>
Sadly, I should mention that the market often gets stuck here, especially<br>
where government is involved.  Rather than accept lower wages, people use<br>
unions and political pressures to force wages higher than they are worth.<br>
This is the REAL source of involuntary unemployment.  If firms find it more<br>
politically acceptable to lay off workers than to cut their wages, or are<br>
unable to accept low wages due to minimum wage laws, then involuntary<br>
unemployment results.  So to say that such transitions are smooth and clean<br>
and costless would be false, and the government doesn't make this any<br>
better.  However, at least in this case the problem seems soluable: change<br>
government policy and you eliminate this problem altogether.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So here is my question:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With the 100's of millions to be displaced by this sophisticated</i><br>
automation, what<br>
<i>&gt;kinds of jobs will they be able to do instead?  Are you suggesting that</i><br>
eventually<br>
<i>&gt;all of us will become doctors, sceintists, engineeers, designers, artists and</i><br>
<i>&gt;writers?  Because those are the only types of jobs that I can see that</i><br>
will be the<br>
<i>&gt;last to succumb to automation.</i><br>
<p>
If you're right, and these are indeed the areas in which humans will have<br>
comparative advantage, then yes.  Remember, the increasing automation will<br>
also mean that it will be cheaper and easier to get an education than it<br>
was in the past, and that doing an hour's worth of labor will be worth much<br>
more than it was in the past.  So in the not so distant future we can<br>
expect that people will not only be able to accept lower wages and still<br>
get by, but get an education on the side.<br>
