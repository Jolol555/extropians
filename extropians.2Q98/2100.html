  The effect of switching between a phytohemagglutinin-containing and a control<br>

Abstract<br>
  The present study concerns the importance of the timing of feeding mice a<br>
  PHA-containing diet (7 mg g-1 diet) on tumor formation. The major decrease in<br>
  tumor weight occurred in mice fed on the PHA diet for 11 days. A marked<br>
  reduction was also observed in animals pre-fed for 3 days with PHA before<br>
  tumor cells were injected and the diet then changed to lactalbumin, La. A<br>
  large decrease in tumor weight was also evident when a change of diet from La<br>
  to PHA was made on the day of tumor cell inoculation. Despite the presence of<br>
  the developing tumor PHA was able to induce hyperplasia of the small<br>
  intestine in all groups of animals fed PHA during a part or the whole of the<br>
  experiment. The dry weights of tumors attained in each of the experimental<br>
  groups plotted as a function of duration of PHA feeding, and the percentage<br>
  lipid content of the tumors, mirrored almost exactly one another, suggesting<br>
  that the availability of essential lipid material is severely reduced by the<br>
  lectin. This would appear to have a major effect on the observed reduction in<br>
  tumor growth.<br>

Title<br>
  Phytohemagglutinin-induced gut hyperplasia and the growth of a mouse<br>
  lymphosarcoma tumor.<br>
Source<br>
  J Exp Ther Oncol.  1(3):171-6, 1996 May.<br>
Abstract<br>
  NMRI mice injected subcutaneously with Krebs II lymphosarcoma cells and fed<br>
  on a diet containing the kidney bean lectin phytohemagglutinin (PHA) within<br>
  the range 0.45-7.0 mg/g diet, developed tumors during a 10 day period which<br>
  on average were only 35% of the dry weight of tumors in lactalbumin (La) fed<br>
  mice (control). The reduction in growth occurred in a dose-dependent manner<br>
  in the range 0.45-3.5 mg/g diet. The degree of hyperplasia of the small<br>
  intestine in response to feeding the PHA diets was higher in non-injected<br>
  compared to injected mice. A lipolytic effect of PHA was observed above 1.75<br>
  mg/g diet in control mice and the highest concentration had a major effect on<br>
  body weight. Since the index of hyperplasia at the lowest PHA concentration<br>
  tested did not correlate with the reduction in tumor size, it is suggested<br>
  that other factors in addition to the initial lectin-induced gut hyperplasia<br>
  are involved in slowing down the progression of tumor growth.<br>
