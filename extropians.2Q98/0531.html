This sounds like something that could be tried with a fairly low investment<br>
= a couple of big shop vacuums and some large tubing. Perhaps we could build<br>
a scale model for experimenting??<br>
<p>
As far as shunting aside - there are existing diverter valves for pneumatic<br>
mail delivery systems that could be tried...<br>
<p>
I still am worried about frictional losses. All pneumatic systems lose a<br>
good deal of energy due to compression heating of the working fluid..<br>
