I wonder - most satellites are covered with silver or gold colored foil as<br>
a solar reflector - but it's usually not smooth, so you would get a fair<br>
diffusion there. I don't know about solar panels..<br>
<p>
GPS and suitable software that can access a database of geosynch satellites<br>
should be able to aim the transmitter and reciever optics at the same<br>
satellite. You would need both transmitter and receiver to agree on what<br>
bird to aim at.<br>
<p>
The lunar retroreflectors are corner cubes, so there's much more<br>
directionality to the return beam. A diffuse reflector would be wasting a<br>
large proportion of the incident beam.<br>
<p>
Possibly, a first step would be to use a CW laser, and on/off modulate it<br>
with the modulation bits tied to an atomic timebase - you can get the<br>
timing signal from the GPS system - and the receiver would be synchronous<br>
to the transmitter. Hams have used similar schemes for years to get<br>
reliable communications in very high noise conditions..<br>
