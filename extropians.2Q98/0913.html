No doubt you'll get carpal-tunnel syndrome a day early. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Ah, yes, and such a look at history would have no doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;given Benjamin Franklin a good idea as to whether, say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;horseless carraiges were likely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;History is so influenced by accident and starting conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that it is practically useless for determining the possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You cannot compare technological innovation to social and economic</i><br>
models.<br>
<p>
I would say that you cannot consider social and economic<br>
models without reference to the assumed technology, since<br>
various models are more efficient at different levels and kinds<br>
of technological progress.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Most social and economic models of today can be found in the far past.</i><br>
<p>
What is more interesting, to me, is that there seem to be only <br>
a few models that work even relatively well, at our technology.<br>
Nearly every nation, today, has a variation on the same basic<br>
type of government, with one head of government, ostensibly<br>
elected, and some governing body of more than a few people,<br>
whatever it is called (congress, soviet, councilors, or parliament).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Primitive cultures often have councils or single leaders, the Roman</i><br>
Republic<br>
<i>&gt;is often compared to democracy and so on. Although the names differ,</i><br>
there<br>
<i>&gt;are not many possible power constellations and economic systems.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;World history should give some examples for free markets in larger</i><br>
<i>&gt;societies, if they were possible and useful. According to my knowledge,</i><br>
it<br>
<i>&gt;doesn't.</i><br>
<p>
First, there have been only a few "larger" societies, before<br>
our era, because technology did not usually permit it.  The<br>
only one that I can think of in ancient times was China, <br>
which also had the highest technology.  Coincidence?<br>
I also would say that initial conditions seem to have <br>
played a large role in the emergence of the world we <br>
have today.  <br>
It seems to me that centralized control is simply<br>
not possible in a large-scale, high technology<br>
(nanotech, AI, etc) society.  The controllers must<br>
have some advantage over the citizenry (numbers,<br>
in putting down revolts at low tech; artillery or nukes<br>
at high tech), and after the advent of nanotechnology,<br>
it is difficult to see any way for them to retain that <br>
advantage.<br>
