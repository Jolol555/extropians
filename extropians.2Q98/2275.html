I think you answered this in your mail. One other answer is, 'marketing'<br>
(cf. Betamax vs. VHS).<br>

<p>
Free membership for the best essay written by an undergraduate in the<br>
following disciplines, etc. <br>
<p>

<p>
I quite agree. But, also, the philosophy of Extropianism, particularly its<br>
politico-social philosophy might be appropriately restricted by the<br>
specialization and stratification of the nodes. For instance, the political<br>
arguments may not find there way on to the scientific lists. In many ways I<br>
consider this a good thing. One of the strong attractions of Extropianism<br>
for me is its transhuman interests which lend themselves to scientific<br>
debate, without getting lost in the mire of political thought. (Not to say<br>
that the two aren't interlinked, or that that linkage is not important.<br>
Merely to say that sometimes separation is a good thing.)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And for those of you who see money as the solution, then rest assured some</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; revenue generation planning would form part of the grand scheme.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To get something going I imagine that revenue would be needed less than </i><br>
<i>&gt;time and creativity. Later on, such a system may pay for itself.  </i><br>
<p>
Or, if it really takes off, more than pay for itself. And that revenue<br>
would form the basis of ExI's ability to further expand, including,<br>
perhaps, the awarding of grants to certain parties.<br>
