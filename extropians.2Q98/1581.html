Year 2000<br>
Computer Technology (Processing, Interface, Software, Networks):<br>
<p>
PC speed: 600 MHZ<br>
PC Storage:  50GB hard drives available for high end servers using<br>
near-field recording (see <a href="http://www.terastor.com/">http://www.terastor.com/</a>).<br>
Software: Win 98 begins loosing ground to Win NT and open-source OS -<br>
probably Linux.<br>
Networks: Project Oxygen (<a href="http://www.oxygen.org">http://www.oxygen.org</a>) begins<br>
testing/operations of 20-80 Global network.  Aprox 20,000 of 320,000 km<br>
of fiber layed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Communication Technology:</i><br>
Cell Telephony and palmtops completely merge w/ java applet capability.<br>
First color screens.  Sat-Cell service rates almost down to $1/min.<br>
Teledesic begins operations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science &amp; Technology:</i><br>
Genetic &amp; neural-network algorithms become more ubiquitous in high-end<br>
engineering optimization searches.  Only moderate gains in memory for<br>
Alzheimer's patients.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; General Medicine:</i><br>
Angiostatin-endostatin works in humans as well as in rats.<br>
Breakthroughs in artificial artery growth.  Artificially grown skin<br>
becomes more available.  Full-body transplants in primates more<br>
successful via improved nerve regeneration.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Other Biology:</i><br>
'Biomimetics' becomes a household word.  Major businesses begin adopting<br>
industrial ecological accounting procedures facilitated by the internet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Power Technology:</i><br>
Fuel Cells become available for laptops and cell phones, greatly<br>
extending battery life.. Plastic batteries enter the market.  Cold<br>
Fusion begins getting some serious attention again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Manufacturing and Materials Science &amp; Technology</i><br>
Arrays of STMs-on-a-chip for crude mechanosynthesis ("diamond weaving")<br>
demonstrated; MEMs become ubiquitous in major consumer devices<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; General Transportation Technology:</i><br>
"networked cars" available at high prices, but people would rather drive<br>
than be driven.<br>
<p>
<p>
Year 2005<br>
<i>&gt; Computer Technology (Processing, Interface, Software, Networks):</i><br>
<p>
PC speed: 3-5 GHz<br>
<p>
PC Storage: 100-200 Gbt hard drives common through proliferation of<br>
Near-Field Recording, 1Git DRAM's pervasive making solid state recording<br>
more useful.  Holographic storage available on high-end servers and<br>
mainframes.<br>
<p>
Interface: Wearable computer interfaces (see below) become completly<br>
customizable as genetic and neural-network algorithms grow/adapt an<br>
interface increasingly to your liking.  Sophisticated EEG monitors mood<br>
for appropiate interface.<br>
<p>
Networks: Everything is networked. IPV6 becomes standard.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Communication Technology:</i><br>
Computer and communications devices are completely merged.  Wearable<br>
computers with HUD's and video overlay, GPS, Teledesic connections,<br>
nerual-network agents, cognitive enhancment software feedback<br>
agents/reminders.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science &amp; Technology:</i><br>
Very effective 3rd generation smart drugs enter the market.  Alzheimer's<br>
patients regain 90% of mental capacity. Spinal regeneration a complete<br>
success.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Genetic Science and Technology:</i><br>
Human Genome project completed.  Genetic privacy/abuse and<br>
discrimination cases become front-page news.  Majority of genes that<br>
cause aging found.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; General Medicine:</i><br>
AIDS  and 95% of cancer eradicated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Other Biology:</i><br>
biodegradable materials become commonplace.  Industrial Ecology becomes<br>
the the corporate nore for operating an efficient business.  Biological<br>
waste-recycling replaces chemical treatment as method of choice for<br>
municipal plants.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Power Technology:</i><br>
Breakthroughs in Solar-tech materials emulating photosynthesis flood the<br>
market as a cheap alternative to centralized power distribution.  **Cold<br>
Fusion is either completely debunked or completely revolutionizes the<br>
world**<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Manufacturing and Materials Science &amp; Technology</i><br>
Desktop Manufacturing companies start cropping up in every city and town<br>
in the developed world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; General Transportation Technology:</i><br>
networked cars still not popular, but networked trains, plains, and<br>
trucks do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Aeronautics:</i><br>
VTOL aircraft start pushing the helicopter out of its traditional<br>
markets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Space Technology and Development:</i><br>
 First SSTO's begin operation.  Amateurs launch first rocket into orbit,<br>
ushering in the era of micro-sats to the terror of the intelligence<br>
community.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personal Lifestyles:</i><br>
Sub-cultures come and go in weeks, social networks become completely<br>
detached from geography.  "Burning Man" type festivals crop up<br>
everywhere.  TAZ's become PAZ's. 'Family' becomes increasingly<br>
re-defined around affinity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Law and Government:</i><br>
Traditional goverments/nation states become increasingly transparent and<br>
irrelevant.  Smart Contracts render majority of lawyers unemployed<br>
(unemployable? :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Art and Entertainment:</i><br>
With the increased wealth of a networked and automated economy, the<br>
demand for art and entertainment skyrockets.  Art/Entertianment activity<br>
becomes ubiquitous.<br>
