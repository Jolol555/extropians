Of course we must be careful in how we are defining 'smart' here.  Is it smart to<br>
limit the rights of other sentient beings if your goal is to increase your overall<br>
understanding of the world and enrich your own complexity, or is smart defined as<br>
pure survival and domination at any cost? The Chinese government (PRC) has<br>
successfully repressed its citizens in order to survive and remain in power. Is the<br>
PRC smarter than western democracies which have some inherent liberties for its<br>
citizens?<br>
<p>
Many would argue that survival and emotional-territorial drives are the low-end of<br>
intelligence - after all every species has the survival urge, and most multicelled<br>
species have the territorial.<br>

<i>&gt; all, it would be a moot question to ask whether we should grant THEM</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights...  the question would be whether they would grant rights to us.</i><br>
<p>
I think it is very likely that any improvement we can give to our children through<br>
germline engineering, will be surpassed by even more advanced transhumanist<br>
technologies made available to existing individuals.<br>
