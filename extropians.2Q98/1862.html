<p>
They are not contrary at all, if you agree with me that libertarianism is<br>
more conducive to net utility than any other political scheme (except<br>
possibly anarcho-capitalism, but I believe anarcho-capitalism will arrive<br>
at a libertarian system of laws). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   I think it's indisputable that market activity</i><br>

<i>&gt;   make money for me-first and my family.</i><br>
<p>
True!  A capitalist economy can withstand people acting completely in<br>
their self interests with no thought for other people's utility.  How? <br>
Well, in order to get what you want in a capitalist economy, you have to<br>
help people in some meangingful way.  If somebody feels that something you<br>
could do for them would increase their utility, then they will pay you for<br>
it, maximizing the utility of both parties, despite the fact that this was<br>
neither person's intent.<br>
<p>
As an economic principle, voluntary transactions necessarily lead to an<br>
increase in utility for both parties; otherwise, the parties would not<br>
participate in the exchange.  This ultimately leads us to agree with<br>
Smith's assertion of the "invisible hand:" that rational self-interested<br>
agents acting in a free market economy maximize the utility of all those<br>
within the economy, despite the fact that nobody was trying to do so.<br>
<p>
For this reason, I endorse capitalism.  I endorse libertarianism because<br>
it allows capitalism to work the most smoothly.  I endorse anarcho-<br>
capitalism because I believe that it will work better still.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Ayn Rand has very accurately, in my opinion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   mapped the me-first nature of libertarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   In effect, the greatest good is served by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   me-first principle with the only constraint </i><br>
<i>&gt;   being the prohibition of the Initiation of </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Force, Theft, and Fraud. So we could say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   I believe, that the logical utilitarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;   principle is: "me first" + (-IF.T.F.).</i><br>
<p>
It would be clearer if you simply replaced "Force, Theft, and Fraud" with<br>
the broader category of "coercion."  From this perspective, people acting<br>
in a "me first" way, who at the same time fail to coerce one another, will<br>
maximize utility.<br>
<p>
Now, keep in mind that the acting participants in this economy are NOT<br>
utilitarian, or at least, don't have to be.  Simply by virtue of the fact<br>
that they act according to egoism and yet are constrained from coercion,<br>
the optimal utilitarian consequence results.  However, this is NOT true<br>
from the perspective of the egoist: if I were an egoist, (that is, if I<br>
considered an action morally right if and only if it maximized my own<br>
utility; this is different from Rand's definition in a meanginful way) I<br>
would REJECT libertarianism, and instead struggle to become king: to<br>
steal, cheat, and defraud others in any way necessary to get what I want. <br>
Though this would make others worse off, it would make me much much better<br>
off, and THIS would be the optimal egoist consequence. <br>
<p>
Rand makes an argument which I don't find convincing: that having honesty,<br>
integrity, etc. is actually in one's own self-interest, because in order<br>
to be rationally consistent, one must not prevent others from acting<br>
morally, that is, one must not prevent others from seeking their own self<br>
interest.  I disagree wholeheartedly: An effective king will be much<br>
better off than an honest capitalist, despite the fact that others will be<br>
made much worse off under the king than they would under capitalism; if<br>
this prevents others from "acting morally," SO BE IT, because our moral<br>
code doesn't say anything about OTHERS, only about maxmizing our OWN<br>
utility.  If preventing others from acting morally would maximize one's<br>
own utility, then egoism DEMANDS that you prevent others from acting<br>
morally.<br>
<p>
Take this thought experiment: You have the opportunity to steal something<br>
you want; you know that you will not be caught.  Your utility will<br>
increase if you steal it, while the owner's utility will decrease more<br>
than yours increases.  An egoist, acting to maximize agent utility, will<br>
steal; a utilitarian, acting to maximize net utility, will not steal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;THIS is the philosophy you have so maligned....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: I believe that any given philosophy </i><br>
<i>&gt;   or proposition must be tested by seeing </i><br>
<i>&gt;   how far it can stretch, such as, "Does </i><br>
<i>&gt;   it support Nazism?"  being an agreed</i><br>
<i>&gt;   upon worst-case point of reference.</i><br>
<p>
And while we're at it, egoism WOULD endorse the slaughtering of others, if<br>
you liked that sort of thing and could get away with it.  Utilitarianism,<br>
however, obviously does not endorse slaughter, because it would not<br>
maxmize net utility.<br>
