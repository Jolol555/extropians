I really hadn't firmly decided on ExI-only access, Paul, so your suggestion<br>
comes at a good time. It is important for us to increase the value of an<br>
ExI membership if we want to retain and increase membership -- a goal<br>
crucial to ExI's continued existence and functioning. I think we can<br>
achieve that goal if we allow non-ExI members to be Observers for a fee<br>
(invited non-member Participants would have free access), while it's free<br>
for members. What that fee should be, I'll have to think about.<br>
<p>
The only concern I have about this is that it requires more accounting to<br>
keep track of who has paid for each list. I simply am *not* going to use my<br>
time to do this! If ExI can turn over its database management to another<br>
party, it could work. This may be a possibility, but is not the case now.<br>
My proposal was intended as a simple way of getting the NodeNet going given<br>
our severely limited resources. If the system is complicated and requires<br>
volunteers to do a lot of work, it is not going to work. Allowing<br>
non-members access for a fee does add complications, but if I can work that<br>
out, it would certainly be preferable.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can't help getting the feeling though that somehow such a system will in</i><br>
<i>&gt;short time be abused by the occasional shortcomings of the NodeMaster, where</i><br>
<i>&gt;personal feelings, egos and the like will keep otherwise intelligent posters</i><br>
<i>&gt;from being included.  </i><br>
<p>
I have no doubt that this is true. In a simple, workable initial system, I<br>
don't see how to avoid that. It will not be perfect, but at least it will<br>
have come into existence. If the NodeNet grows well, perhaps a more<br>
elaborate and fault-resistant version can be installed.<br>
<p>
Also, the intrinsic exclusivity of the NodeNet is almost<br>
<i>&gt;completely retrograde to the evolution of the Net as a spontaneously ordered,</i><br>
<i>&gt;open, agoric, free-marketplace of ideas.</i><br>
<p>
I strongly disagree with this. While the Net as a whole is a spontaneous<br>
order, it harbors within itself numerouse orders that are planned or<br>
semi-planned. The economy as a whole is a spontaneous order (at least to a<br>
large degree--it is possible to tinker with its constitutive legal rules),<br>
but many companies and agencies within it have a much higher degree of<br>
planned order. Evolution is a spontaneously ordering process, but its<br>
products are biologically ordered systems whose structure is largely<br>
"planned" by the genes. <br>
<p>
Without filtering systems (many different ones), which are typically<br>
planned orders, the broader spontaneous order would produce little or<br>
nothing of worth. The goal for an organization like ExI is to find the<br>
temporarily optimal balance between the two kinds of order. Letting just<br>
anyone post in the forums will not maximize their productiveness. Letting<br>
anyone on the Net set up *their own* forums run on a different basis, with<br>
different moderators, *does* maxmize productiveness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All I can say here, is I hope such an idealistic scenario works.  As Heinlien</i><br>
<i>&gt;once said "Specialization is for insects", </i><br>
<p>
Then it's a good thing that subscribers will be able to join many forums,<br>
that many of the forums are multi-disciplinary, and that we will have two<br>
general mailing lists in addition.<br>
<p>
Heinlein also said: "If it can't be expressed in figures, it is not<br>
science; it is opinion." He certainly saw a place for deliberately<br>
structured orders as well as the free markets he favored.<br>

Onward!<br>
