Isn't exformation just meta-informaiton<br>

<i>&gt; Information is measured in number of bits (or more commonly kilobytes or</i><br>
<i>&gt; megabytes). This measure does not tell you much about meaning of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; information. If I would convert this mail to a gif picture or an mpeg</i><br>
<i>&gt; slideshow it would take more information to hold it, and perhaps give a</i><br>
<i>&gt; heavier hype measure (or spam measure), but it wouldn't contain more</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The concept of Exformation is on the other hand more meaningful. When you</i><br>
<i>&gt; buy milk, butter and eggs, you get a receipt containing a list of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; items and a total. The list contains more information that the total, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are more interested in the total, because that is what you will pay to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cashier. The total contains more Exformation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The total is computed using the addition algorithm, and in fact the purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt; of any algorithm (the useful ones at least) is to produce exformation, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; information. Information is not good in itself, the less you can do with,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the better (ok, I know there are some info-junkies out there :-).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The interesting question is, how is exformation measured? I claim that</i><br>
<i>&gt; exformation is measured as money. It fits nicesly in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; production-consumption theory. You produce exformation, sell it to someone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; who consumes the information. Although I'm just an economist wannabe, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would like to go as far as to say that exformation *is* money. You don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know how valuable something is/was until you actually sell it. But as</i><br>
<i>&gt; exformation is laos closely related to algorithmic complexity, exformation</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be measured as time. So money is time. The time someone has to spend</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead of spending money.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The definition of Extropy (in The Extropians Principles) says it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure of Information (among other things), but more accurately this should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be Exformation. So if Exformation is one measure of Extropy, perhaps Bill</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gates really is the greates Extropian among us.</i><br>
