playerThe Secret Is Out!<br>
See Why Winners Choose One Cryo,  It's All About Performance<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Softball Enthusiast:<br>
<p>
Cryogenics has rapidly become the hottest buzz word in the softball industry. Manufacturers like <br>
Worth, Bombat and Catapult now feature a complete cryo line of bats. If your bat has not yet been <br>
treated, act now and seize this opportunity to take advantage of our special 3 for the price of 2 <br>
offer, and find out for yourself why the entire industry is talking about cryo.<br>
<p>
And as you know, there is no better time than NOW, to increase your batting average. That's why <br>
we have put together this special offer...<br>
<p>
Send us two of your bats at our regular price and include a third bat at no additional charge. Same <br>
great process, same great service as we have always provided, we're just giving you a freebee and <br>
all we ask in return is that you help us spread the word to your friends and teammates about the <br>
benefits of cryogenics. <br>
<p>
Don't listen to us. Here's what Alcoa, the world's leading manufacturer of Aluminum had to say about <br>
cryogenics...<br>
<p>
"In the rapid water quench following heat treat, bat temperature is reduced from about 900 degrees <br>
F to room temperature in a matter of seconds. Because the outside of the bat cools faster than the <br>
inside, there is a residual inward stress on the bat... tests show that this stress is actually reversed in <br>
the cryogenic process to an outward stress. Since stress is a force, an outward stress can serve to <br>
enhance the force of impact on the ball. This can be viewed as increasing the trampoline effect of <br>
the bat". Customers report, Cryogenics increased distance of their bats 10 to 40 feet.<br>
<p>
One Cryo is the official cryogenic bat supplier for USSSA Senior Softball. Our process is endorsed by <br>
USSSA Hall of Famer Steve Leighton and USSSA Half Century Director Coach Roach. <br>
<p>
Articles about Deep Cryogenic Tempering have been published in numerous publications such as <br>
Winston Cup Scene - December 1997, Brevard Softball Magazine - August 1997, Motorcycle <br>
Magazine - October 1996, National Speed Sport News - September 25th 1996, Cruisin' Style - <br>
September 1996, Metlfax - August 1996, Orlando Sentinel, Sports - September 5th 1996, Orlando <br>
Sentinel, Business -July 15th 1996, American Machinist - May 1996, USA Today - February 5th <br>
1996, Metallurgia - September 1995, Power Transmission and Design - September 1995, Modern <br>
Application News - January 1994, Precision Shooting - January &amp; December 1994, Short Track <br>
Racing - October 1994, Gear Technology - March/April 1993, Cutting Tool Engineering - August <br>
1992, Industrial Heating - August 1992, just to name a few. Deep Cryogenic Tempering has also <br>
been featured on the Discovery Channel's "NextStep" program by Paul and Phil "the answer guys", <br>
episode 83 Fall 1995, as well as on TNN's "Inside NASCAR"  December 1997, hosted by Ned <br>
Jarret.<br>

Still Skeptical  -  Not Convinced Yet?   -  Here's some additional background...<br>
<p>
PERFORMANCE THROUGH ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY<br>
CRYOGENICS: A Stress REDUCTION Process<br>
<p>
CRYOGENICS IS A BRANCH OF PHYSICS THAT DEALS WITH THE PRODUCTION AND <br>
EFFECTS OF ULTRA LOW TEMPERATURES:   Researchers began studying and quantifying the <br>
benefits of Cryogenics on tool steels back in the late 1960's in University research labs. Since then <br>
Cryogenics has been used in the medical industry for preserving tissues, in aerospace for stress <br>
relieving alloys sent into space and manufacturers have used it to increase the performance and <br>
wear life of race car parts. Over the last couple of years Cryogenics has found its way back to the <br>
universities and in research labs such as ALCOA's. <br>
<p>
THE CRYOGENIC PROCESS:   The Cryogenic process consists of super cooling the bat to -300 <br>
degrees F at a very slow rate and then maintaining this ultra low temperature for up to 36 hours. <br>
After which the bats are returned back to room temperature at less than one degree per minute.<br>
<p>
THE EFFECTS OF CRYOGENICS:   In recent testing performed by an ALCOA metallurgist and a <br>
new product development manager, it was found that the cryogenically treated bats displayed a <br>
reduction in residual stress. This is consistent with the results discovered during the 1950's when the <br>
process was often referred to as "uphill quenching". In a separate research project conducted at a <br>
major university, it was verified that the Cryogenic process changes the state of residual stress in the <br>
bat. This is important because the effects of residual stress can increase the effects of external <br>
force applied to the material (in this case, impact of the ball on the bat).<br>
<p>
HOW CRYOGENIC TREATMENT CAN INCREASE TRAMPOLINE EFFECT:  The reduction in <br>
residual stress along with the realignment of the molecules uniformity brought about by the cryogenic <br>
treatment, can result in an enhancement of the trampoline effect, which occurs in the bat's "sweet <br>
spot" during the time of momentary impact and kinetic energy transfer with the ball.<br>
<p>
WHAT CAN CRYOGENICS DO FOR MY BAT?   Because the reduction in residual stress can <br>
influence the force of impact between the ball and the bat, as well as increasing the effective <br>
strength, the following benefits to bat performance have been observed:<br>
<p>
1.   	An Increase of 2 to 4% in hit distance, as much as 20 to 40 feet<br>
2.    Enhanced "feel" resulting from reduction of internal vibrations<br>
3.    Improved durability to resist denting<br>
4.   	Enhanced Trampoline effect<br>
5.	Enhances "sweet spot"<br>
6.	Cryo Bats are legal in all leagues of play	<br>
