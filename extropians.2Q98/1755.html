   IAN: Unlike this one. I think that the atomist<br>
   paradigm is properly defined as the  crackpot <br>
   paradigm. How so? If we think of the universe<br>
   as a pot, atomism is the process of breaking<br>
   that pot, cracking it into ten zillion sepe-<br>
   rate fragments. Holism is the healing of <br>
   the cracked pot of atomist fallacy.<br>
<p>
   A = A is A cracked away from the whole.<br>
   A = A + (-A) is A rejoined to the whole,<br>
   as A exists in reality. When we take<br>
   atomism for real, we slip into <br>
   an "atomistic psychosis."<br>
<p>
   Atomism is useful, and defines how we meta-<br>
   phorically subtract a thing from the whole <br>
   and thereby draw attention to it and away<br>
   from other things.  If I say, "Pass the <br>
   salt shaker," but define "salt shaker"<br>
   as salt shaker + not-salt-shaker,<br>
   your going to have some trouble<br>
   passing it, or, I already have it.<br>
   Yet at all times the salt shaker exits,<br>
   it is what it is by relation to not-it.<br>
<p>
   What is so amazing about the human mind<br>
   is how it becomes conditioned to believe<br>
   that it's own programing is THE truth, <br>
   that A actually is A free from not-A. <br>
   The mind confuses a useful fallacy <br>
   with reality, and that's psychosis.<br>
<p>
   That's why during mystical experiences,<br>
   or temporal-lobe epilepsy, the mind's<br>
   program suddenly crashes, it stops, and <br>
   yet the "I am" is still there and like <br>
   a flood of light and realization I see <br>
   that all things are unified, that the <br>
   mind created this illusion of sepera-<br>
   tion, of isolated and free identities,<br>
   when in fact up is down, in is out,<br>
   where A is A only by relation to -A,<br>
   and A is all that which defines it.<br>
<p>
   A thing exists on in context and no<br>
   thing exists free from context, not<br>
   even the cracked pot of atomism.<br>
