   I was remembering Acton's dictum about all power tending to corrupt; <br>
   and absolute power tending to corrupt absolutely.<br>
<p>
   Also, I am mindful that many of the greatest (and lesser) atrocities <br>
   are carried out by people who believe themselves to be _doing good._  <br>
   This is why Nazism is still incomprehensible to most people -- the <br>
   Nazis thought of themselves as heroes, doing wonderful (albeit <br>
   distasteful) things for the world.  Like the 'Republicans'...<br>

   I'll take the first thousand names in the telephone directory anyday.<br>

<p>
   Category error: Individual freedom is _not_ an economic system.  I <br>
   would insistently remind you that 50% of America's small farmers went <br>
   broke during the Reagan years; a whole way of life of priceless value <br>
   for hosts of families snuffed out by 'agribusiness', buyer cartels and <br>
   banks.<br>
   <br>
   If you fondly imagine that the USA's economic system rewards hard work <br>
   (and the economists do tell us that the economic system is Wertfrei, <br>
   remember, and doesn't 'reward' _anything_), ask yourself why, in the <br>
   US, there is a near-perfect _inverse ratio_ between how arduous and <br>
   unpleasant the work is, and how much you get paid for doing it.<br>
<p>
   There is much truth in the wry observation that 'most people are too <br>
   busy working to make any money.'   Or, over here, banker Jim Slater's <br>
   observation that: "There are thing-makers; and there money-makers.  The <br>
   thing-makers don't make any money, and the money-makers don't make any <br>
   thing."<br>
<p>
<p>
   I've owned and run a design and manufacturing business; and met a <br>
   payroll.  Believe me -- I know wherof I speak...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; An Absolute Foundation? Of what kind? </i><br>
<p>
     ANY kind!!!<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt; And based on what Doctrine of the sourch of such Rights</i><br>
<p>
     ANY basis!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Y'know, most trust fund babies that I have met have been the most </i><br>
<i>&gt; spendthrift, lazy, unmotivated, unsuccessfull slobs I have ever known.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I really don't fear such morons,</i><br>
<p>
     Go meet Richard Mellon Scaife...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
     There is a near-perfect correlation between the incomes and holdings <br>
     of individuals in the US, and the incomes and holdings of their <br>
     children.  And their childrens' children...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; it's then much easier for active anarcho capitalists like myself to score</i><br>
<i>&gt; a big profit on a few deals.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Unless you're saying that anarcho-capitalism is a good guide to <br>
profit-making (a thesis contradicted by nearly every anarcho-capitalist <br>
I've ever met, almost none of whom have any money and most of whom have <br>
appalling judgement in financial matters)  I simply have no idea what you <br>
mean by that. And consistent Randians would advise talented people to make <br>
as _little_ as possible, so as to withold resources from the looter State.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yet, I am not aware of any children here in the US or other highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalist/mercantilist economies that die from malnutrition, other than</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who are suffering from such psychological ailments as anorexia.</i><br>
<p>
In 1990 the infant mortality rate in Washington, D.C. was the highest in <br>
the nation.  And there is a near-perfect inverse correlation between <br>
family income and and infant mortality rates.  There is also the <br>
progressive degeneration of childrens' health due to poor nutrition <br>
leading to secondary illnesses and weakened immune systems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ethiopia, OTOH, that socialist paradise, has lost more people to </i><br>
<i>&gt; malnutrition in 15 years than are currently alive there today.</i><br>
<p>
      Notice that I'm not defending or advocating State Socialism...<br>
      <br>
      Still, it is within our power to save the lives of children in <br>
      Ethiopia; we simply choose _not to_, preferring luxury ice-cream, <br>
      and jewelled collars for our dogs.  Think about that while spooning <br>
      down the Haagen-Dazs...<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Agorism. (n). Horizontalist, 'reticular' or networked system of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interacting _equals_.  Note that Agorism is a fully-fledged _social_</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; system while Capitalism is an _economic_ system.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yet Agorism takes its name from the ancient term for 'the market'. Do </i><br>
<i>&gt; agorists emphasize the minor social aspects of a community bazaar, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; blithely ignoring the over-riding economic aspects?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
       Oh, fer chrissake!  Essentialism gone mad -- you're trying to <br>
       extrapolate the description from the word itself, when the word is <br>
       just a token or 'macro' for the longer description of a networked <br>
       or reticular 'horizontally' - based society of equals interacting <br>
       as freely as may be possible -- 'cooperative individualism.'<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any system will wind up with the end that its members deserve. If the </i><br>
<i>&gt; members of an anarcho-capitalist society refuse to take personal responsibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; for themselves, then they will wind up in the sort of tyrrany that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; automatically assume any such society to be.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    This is bullshit for any system.  It's blatant bullshit for <br>
    anarcho-capitalism, where half a dozen rich people of moderate <br>
    cleverness can control the entire society by owning key resources.<br>
    <br>
    Suppose the Saudis bought up the entire US road system and made <br>
    observance of Islam a condition of use.  That OK with you?  And don't <br>
    give us that 'we can all buy helicopters' guff, purleease...  They can <br>
    forbid over-flights.  How do you deal with it?<br>
    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anarcho Capitalism is not, as a whole, beneficial for the stupid, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; weak, or the faint of heart. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
       Or for the sound in mind...   &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It should be noted that the US, which most will agree is the 'most' capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy in the world, leads the world in personal per capita giving, in both </i><br>
<i>&gt; time and money, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of income and</i><br>
<i>&gt; assets.</i><br>
<p>
      I don't think the US is the most 'capitalist' country in the world. <br>
      It does have among the world's leading per capita incomes and a <br>
      large poulation.  @ $8 trillion economy; 265 m people; cf. European <br>
      Union with @ $8 trillion economy and 300 m people.  And in spite of <br>
      the attempts by the Coercive Authoritarians to destroy a free and <br>
      decent society in the US, their project has not completely succeeded <br>
      thus far.<br>
      <br>
      I do take note that they've made the US the only country in the <br>
      civilized, developed world which proposes that workless parents will <br>
      be deprived of the means to ensure their own and their childrens' <br>
      physical and social survival, starting in just a few years' time.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why is it that people living in socialist countries are individually selfish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; materialistic, and ungenerous as compared to Americans???</i><br>
<p>
       Dunno! There are no socialist countries.  Name six -- I dare you!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Depends on whether YOU deserve it or not. If you respect them and give them a wide</i><br>

<i>&gt; making such wild, inflammatory, inaccurate statements about capitalism, individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; liberty, etc, they might just deem you a threat and WILL nuke you, just for</i><br>
<i>&gt; preventions sake....</i><br>
<p>
     Hey, so these 'freedom-loving' Anarcho-capitalists will _nuke_ me <br>
     just for speaking freely and critically concerning their daft <br>
     ideas???  That's a great way to convince your intellectual <br>
     adversaries and innocent bystanders.  "Agree with us or we'll kill <br>
     you!"  Are there flag decals on all of your car windows?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
     I've already had one anarcho-capitalist (David Ramsay Steele) <br>
     threaten to murder me, and actually  lurch across the table at me to <br>
     physically attack me.  I let him go back to Chicago to rejoin his <br>
     wife...  Living in Chicago must be awful...   &gt;:-}<br>

     I must ask Gary North to delineate the differences between 'secular' <br>
     John Birch Society worldviews, and the religious variants.  Birch was <br>
     an atheist as I recall.<br>
<p>
     I like reading Birch Society literature -- mostly it seems so <br>
     sensible and decent -- the sort of people I'd like to know.  Then a <br>
     little item about the Illuminati creeps in -- but the only actual <br>
     Illuminati I can find to read about are Goethe and Schiller, who were <br>
     heroes of the European Enlightenment.  Most of the 'anti' stuff was <br>
     written by Roman Catholic writers opposed to the Continental Masonic <br>
     project of separating Church and State, AFAICS.<br>
