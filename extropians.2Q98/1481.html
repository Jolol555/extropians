People keep handing me these terrific straight lines...  :)<br>
<p>
As it happens, I published a book in 1992, full of otherwise unobtainable<br>
data aand terrific charts, called THE LOTTO EFFECT (Melbourne, Australia:<br>
Hudson, ISBN 0-949873-3-41-1), which is based on exactly this notion.  I<br>
examined some three-quarters of a billion guesses in 20 consecutive draws<br>
of the national Australian Lotto game.  First I normalised the guesses at<br>
each of the numbers in the range 1-45, because populations hold different<br>
preferences and biases toward each of these options - 7 and 13 always get a<br>
markedly enhanced vote, e.g., whereas all the `non-birthday' numbers over<br>
31 get a reduced vote.  Then I did a linear regression to iron out certain<br>
long term irrelevant trends.  Then I compared the normalised votes for each<br>
candidate number *when it was a target* against *when it wasn't*.  <br>
<p>
If psi precognition were operating, one would expect a significantly<br>
elevated (or perhaps a significantly depressed) vote for the six numbers<br>
popping out of the randomiser.  I didn't find that overall, to my chagrin -<br>
but I did locate a very weird effect in which the *most drastically deviant<br>
positive residuals correlated with targets to a far greater extent than one<br>
would expect by chance*.  Opinions differ over whether this post hoc<br>
finding supports the psi hypothesis or is an artefact.  I think that when<br>
the suggested artefact is factored in, there is still evidence for<br>
precognition in the data.<br>
<p>
(BTW, while it is true that `If there were anything to ESP the number of<br>
winners should be larger that what you would expect from chance', the<br>
expected impact isn't as obvious as it seems.  Leaving aside a truly<br>
immense amount of stereotyped entry strategies - the same birthdays every<br>
week, the same `lucky numbers', etc - I assume that each guess is<br>
independent, and therefore each perfect entry requires 6 `psi-mediated<br>
events' (other than those which get some numbers by chance, as some must).<br>
There's a kind of pyramid generated, in which almost all the fairly<br>
infrequent psi events you'd expect in such a population will be wasted on<br>
people who would otherwise by chance get only zero, one, two, or three<br>
right.  This still leaves some opportunity at the top, but it wouldn't be<br>
as dramatic as one might intuitively suppose.  I discuss all this in<br>
monstrous detail in my book.)<br>
<p>
Why isn't this result widely known among New Age fruitcakes and skeptics<br>
alike?  Beats me.  Dr Dean Radin does reference my book in his THE<br>
CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE.  <br>
<p>
Why haven't I just done a simple replication run or two and settled the<br>
matter?  Because it took me about a decade to gouge the goddam data out of<br>
the lottery company, and they are not interested in giving me (or several<br>
interested university statisticians) any more.  Sigh.  But one of these<br>
days, when someone gets the Nobel Prize for this, remember that you saw it<br>
here first...  <br>
<p>
(And yes, I know, Mike Lorrey and I should get together and create a<br>
psi-powered Dean [Radin] Machine, ho ho bloody ho.)<br>
