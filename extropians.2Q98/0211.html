I hate to throw a wrench into the controversy, but most big computer<br>
centers, like Internet providers, have backup generators that automatically<br>
cut in when the mains go down. The phone company has both huge banks of<br>
batteries and backup generators. Many highrise buildings today have enough<br>
cogeneration capacity to allow at least emergency lighting and ventilation<br>
to continue during blackouts. There will undoubtedly be data losses, but not<br>
wholescale devastation.<br>
<p>
If a major processor 'died' because of Y2K, the operators simply need to<br>
reboot it and reset the date to<br>
a safe year until they can remedy the problem.<br>
<p>
Generating stations always have backup power on site - especially nuclear<br>
plants, where the backup must be adequate to operate the plants' safety<br>
systems in the event the reactors are scrammed. If the worst happened, they<br>
could always run the computers from rented generators.<br>
