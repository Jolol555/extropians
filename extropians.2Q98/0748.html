<i>&gt; OK, but the least thing a creator could do is to check if </i><br>
<i>&gt; sentient entities occur in his simulation (e.g. universe). </i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, he (/she/it) could make backup copies of their states </i><br>
<i>&gt; just prior to their destruction. The saved backup copies could </i><br>
<i>&gt; then be restored in a separate simulation (heaven/hell?).</i><br>
<p>
That sounds nice, but it might not be easy to do. First, some of the<br>
entities might suffer a gradual decline (like humans with Alzheimer's<br>
disease), would it be nice to save backup copies of their final,<br>
degraded state or should one save copies from an earlier state? If so,<br>
why just one, why not several? Second, it might not even be clear to<br>
the creator which entities are sentinent and which are not (there<br>
might be a lot of intelligence hidden in the apparent chaos of type<br>
III CAs, invisible until you look at the principal fourier<br>
components). Third, the afterlife is rather underdetermined: how to<br>
keep the entities from pain *there*?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, IMO a creator *can be held responsible* for the individual </i><br>
<i>&gt; events in their creations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Isn't this the same issue as a creator being responsible </i><br>
<i>&gt; for any artificial sentient being(s) he has created.)</i><br>
<p>
Even when the creator has no idea about what sentinent beings will<br>
emerge? If you create a world top-down, in the genesis fashion ("Let<br>
there be animals, to the following specifications... Let there be<br>
chemistry to implement the animals, to the following<br>
specifications...) it is fairly easy to say you are responsible for<br>
the entities you create (but note that they might have free will,<br>
which might give them some responsibility themselves). But if you<br>
create a bottom-up universe (like in game of life: "Let there be an<br>
initial state and the following rules...") you will not know what will<br>
emerge (unless it is a very uninteresting rule set) and you cannot<br>
predict the eventual outcome.<br>
<p>
The unpredictability of Turing machines and complex systems is IMHO<br>
the basis for our free will, and puts a limit on the amount of<br>
responsibility we can place on any creator. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, at Transvision98 we will show a television documentary </i><br>
<i>&gt; which will illustrate exactly this issue: "A creator of a simulation </i><br>
<i>&gt; containing sentient beings is being held responsible" :-&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I look forward to it!<br>
