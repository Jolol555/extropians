  IAN: Exactly. After writing about fuzzy logic <br>
  in a report, I got hostile reactions from <br>
  some folks that saw fuzzy logic as an attack <br>
  on the concept of truth. The entirety of that<br>
  counter against fuzzy stemmed from a failure to <br>
  understand that "fuzzy truth" is a measure of the<br>
  degree that a given word X maps onto the physical<br>
  thing Y that X is purported to describe. The word<br>
  "rain" maps on to a "misty drizzle" to a degree <br>
  that's not 100% or 0% true or false, but the <br>
  physical event described is always 100% true.<br>
<p>
  In that way, fuzzy logic does not devalue physical<br>
  truth, but rather the idea that a given word is 100%<br>
  or 0% true. I wrote this short essay in responce to the <br>
  reactions I got: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/fuzzy.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/fuzzy.htm</a> <br>
