<i>&gt; Yes, the engineer behind this pyramid is the artist and visionary! IF</i><br>
<i>&gt; there were 30 engineers, so what! The accomplishment, the feat, is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sign of there greatness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The Great Pyramid is sometimes atributed to Khufu on the flimsiest of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; evidence; there is considerable debate on this point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Would Khufu still be great if he had nothing to do with it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Is the fellow who actually built it (hypothetically) but never</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; recognized for his achievement great?</i><br>
<p>
A smart and far-sighted architect is behind one of the ancient buildings (I don't <br>
recall which one).  The king ordered a monument in his own honor, so the <br>
pretty white limestone facing had his image, his name, and his achevements all <br>
over it.  But we don't know any of that, now, because that limestone facing <br>
eroded (or was stripped off for other uses) a long time ago.  On the other hand, <br>
we know all about the builder: *his* name, image, and achevements were <br>
engraved in the hard structural rock underneath the limestone.<br>
