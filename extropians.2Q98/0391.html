<i>&gt; From:          Brian D Williams &lt;talon57@well.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin" &lt;warrl@mail.blarg.net&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;I see.  The IRA wants Northern Ireland partitioned into two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sections, with one section falling under their rule (and,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;presumably, passing to the Irish government) and another section</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;going in some other direction (presumably remaining British)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;according to the will of those persons (presumably mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Protestants) who live there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;No, I am not talking about "British Forces".  I am talking about </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;PEOPLE.  Bartenders, farmers, housewives.  Who happen to, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;various reasons, prefer British rule, or at least prefer *not* to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;suffer the fate that the IRA would choose for itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No you do not "see". there will be no further partioning of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind, the IRA will not be the government, the current republican</i><br>
<i>&gt; govt will control ALL of Ireland.</i><br>
<p>
So it's a government of the IRA's choosing, imposed on people who do <br>
not choose it.<br>
<p>
Yep.  The IRA (as an organization) is a looter just like any other <br>
government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The PEOPLE you refer to are descendants of those deliberately</i><br>
<i>&gt; settled onto Irish soil by the British Government, to enforce their</i><br>
<i>&gt; rule, not unlike the British invasion of Iceland in WW II, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; invaders every bit as much as the soldiers. Unlike the soldiers who</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not belong there, they would be free to remain, but under Irish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not British law.</i><br>
<p>
They would be free to give up everything they and their ancestors <br>
have worked for for centuries, or subject themselves to a government <br>
not of their choosing.<br>
<p>
Yep, the IRA is a looter just like any other government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There will be no peace until this is so.</i><br>
<p>
There will be no peace WHEN it is so.  It just hasn't been generally <br>
realized that it is part of the nature of government to make war upon <br>
its own subjects.<br>
