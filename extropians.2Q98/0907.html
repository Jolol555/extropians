   I've been lurking on this list of quite some time, but I'd finally like to<br>
put a few words in.<br>
   The Atheism vs. Agnositicism debate has been going for ages, but what it<br>
really comes down it is simple definitions.  Most of the following is<br>
paraphrased (badly) out of Atheism: The Case Against God by George H. Smith.<br>
<p>
   Atheism by definition means the absence of theistic belief. <br>
Whereas, agnosticism is the idea that something is inherently unknowable. <br>
Notice that by definition agnosticism has nothing to do with any beliefs, it<br>
simply says whether something is knowable or not.  Therefore by these<br>
definitions agnosticism isn't a third alternative to atheism/theism. Only when a<br>
person defines atheism as the actual denial of God is agnosticism an<br>
alternative.  But otherwise there are only two choices, atheism or theism.<br>
   For example, when a baby is born it (probably) has no concept of God or any<br>
other form of theistic beliefs, therefore it is an atheism.  On the other hand,<br>
some religions believe that God is unknowable or beyond our simple human<br>
comprehension, therefore they are agnostic theists.<br>
<p>
  So don't fall into the common misconception that all atheists assert the<br>
nonexistence of God.  There are degrees to atheism, some that do assert that<br>
the concept of God is unintelligible and therefore God can't exist, and then<br>
there are some atheists that are without theistic belief because the theist<br>
cannot provide sufficient evidence to the existence of God(s).<br>
