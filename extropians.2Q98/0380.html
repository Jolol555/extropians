<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The IRA are not after any lands but their own.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Do they not wish to have a government of their own devising?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Do they not wish to include lands owned by people who don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;support them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely not, Northern Ireland is occupied by British Forces and</i><br>
<i>&gt; their allies and has been for many years, but they do not own that</i><br>
<i>&gt; land, and never will.</i><br>
<p>
I see.  The IRA wants Northern Ireland partitioned into two sections, <br>
with one section falling under their rule (and, presumably, passing <br>
to the Irish government) and another section going in some other <br>
direction (presumably remaining British) according to the will of <br>
those persons (presumably mostly Protestants) who live there.<br>
<p>
No, I am not talking about "British Forces".  I am talking about <br>
PEOPLE.  Bartenders, farmers, housewives.  Who happen to, for various <br>
reasons, prefer British rule, or at least prefer *not* to suffer the <br>
fate that the IRA would choose for itself.<br>
