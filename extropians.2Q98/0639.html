In the old joke, a boy asks in sunday school, "if god can do anything,<br>
can he make a rock so big he can't lift it?"<br>
<p>
Imagine what it would be like to be omnipotent.  Suppose you are running<br>
uploaded into a virtual world which you own.  You have direct access<br>
to the software which runs the world, including the software which runs<br>
your own mind.  Using this access, you can do anything to the virtual<br>
reality, alter the laws of nature, alter your own mentality.  You would<br>
be omnipotent in that world.<br>
<p>
Could you make a rock so big you couldn't lift it?<br>
<p>
Suppose you set out to do so.  Given that you were running with a simulated<br>
physical body with some limitations, you could cause the creation of a rock<br>
which your body could not lift in its current configuration.  However,<br>
you would then be able to alter your body so that it could lift the rock.<br>
<p>
A different strategy is called for.  You must suppress your ability to<br>
alter your body.  You create the large rock, and alter your own mentality<br>
so that you will not be able to change your body to lift the rock, for<br>
some period of time.  You might even change yourself so that you will not<br>
*want* to change your body to lift the rock, even under dire circumstances.<br>
<p>
In that way you might be able to lift the rock in some hypothetical sense,<br>
but under the circumstances you are effectivelly prevented from doing so.<br>
So it would appear that you can create a rock so big you can't lift it,<br>
at least by some definition of the words, without impairing your<br>
omnipotence.<br>
<p>
Something similar seems to be done by the character of god in the jesus<br>
story.  In this story, which may be familiar to some readers, god chooses<br>
to experience earthly life.  He causes a woman to become pregnant, and<br>
imbues her son, jesus, with god's own divinity.  In a sense, jesus *is*<br>
god.  This divine power allows him to work various miracles over the course<br>
of his life and he attracts a considerable following.<br>
<p>
However, god's purpose (which is never made very clear in the story)<br>
is apparently not merely to experience life on earth, but especially<br>
to experience human suffering.  He arranges for jesus to be arrested,<br>
tortured, and killed.  Jesus is shown as having something of a dual<br>
nature.  He has access to the divine power of god, but in his last days he<br>
refrains from or is unable to use his power.  He expresses understandable<br>
fear about the torture which he knows he will experience, and which he<br>
must withstand.<br>
<p>
In the throes of hideous pain and near death, he cries out to god,<br>
asking why god has abandoned him.  It seems that at this point, if he<br>
were able to, he would use his power to save himself from the pain.<br>
In appealing to god he is appealing both to the power within himself<br>
and to that aspect of god which is outside of him.  However, there is<br>
no apparent result, and presumably jesus/god has arranged to restrict<br>
his own omnipotence as in the example above.<br>
<p>
It is interesting how these old stories can shed light on some of the<br>
problems and issues we will face as we become gods.<br>
