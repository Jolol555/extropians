<i>&gt;A point they seem to overlook, is if the overall economy and means of</i><br>

<i>&gt;and more people will be better off (as you have eloquently demonstrated), or</i><br>
<i>&gt;conversely a decreasingly smaller elite grabs the whole pie.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If their conclusion is the latter, then it's a major blow to any free-market</i><br>
<i>&gt;principle.  At this point, why would the rest of us give a damn about</i><br>
<i>&gt;free-markets when it means increasing numbers of people will suffer?  If they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are standing behind their principles of insisting on free-markets despite the</i><br>
<i>&gt;large loss of human life, what does this say about them?  This is the *real*</i><br>
<i>&gt;isssue I'm forcing.</i><br>
<p>
 The extreme form of your fear (millions starve to death because technology<br>
has been made obsolete) is fairly easy to discredit. Suppose 10 million<br>
people were laid off tomorrow because a new invention drastically reduced<br>
demand for the jobs they had been doing. Instead of starving, wouldn't<br>
they be better off forming their own economy, using simple technology<br>
and trading among themselves? (Not that that's likely to be the best they<br>
could do, it's merely the simplest to describe).<br>
 I see no sign that automation has been causing or is likely to cause a<br>
significant number of people to need to work harder to maintain a stable<br>
standard of living. As to how hard people will need to work in order to<br>
upload, I don't know.<br>

 I.e. you are only interested in promises of a free lunch from people who<br>
don't trust promises of a free lunch?<br>

 I guess you've never heard of Linux, Netscape, the Red Cross, etc?<br>
