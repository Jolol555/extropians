I wouldn't venture to assert whether science would or would not have<br>
existed had histoy gone differently. However, I think it entirely possible<br>
that we would have had science considerably earlier if Christianity had not<br>
been so strong, with other, better intellectual systems in their place.<br>
<p>
Certainly some aspects of the Christian tradition -- primarily in the<br>
Catholic side (thought the independence-from-authority meme in<br>
Protestantism helped) -- encouraged science. But these were not uniquely<br>
Christian and originated clearly from outside Christianity. They were<br>
essentially due to the respect for Plato and his conviction that universal<br>
rational explanations were possible, and due to the (Platonized)<br>
Aristotelianism of the Catholics. Most of the basic ideas of Christianity,<br>
despite these imports, have been anti-rationalist ("tear the eyes out of<br>
your reason" -- Martin Luthor), and have turned thinkers eyes towards<br>
unworldly realms rather than towards naturalistic investigation.<br>
<p>
If Christianity had died out with nothing in its place, or with Buddhism<br>
taking over (not sure how that could have happened), I'd agree with you.<br>
But what if Hellenic humanism had survived and flourished? If it had,<br>
perhaps the Dark Ages would never had happened, and we wouldn't be dealing<br>
with Rifkin and his kind today.<br>

P.S. Good line from the X-Files movies: Mulder to Sculley: "Your strict<br>
scientific rationalism has saved me a thousand times over."<br>
