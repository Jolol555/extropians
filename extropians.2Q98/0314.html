But where can one get FM 2030's books?  Are they in print?  Few libraries have<br>
them.  Perhaps he was so far ahead of his time, that the works deserve<br>
reprinting.  Any "Extropy Press Publications"?<br>

Certainly this is the nut of the term, " a philosophy of life (such as<br>
extropian philosophy) that seeks the  acceleration of the evolution of<br>
intelligent<br>
life beyond its currently human form and limitations by means of<br>
science and technology" edited with humble intentions, for the continuation of<br>
evolution will occur without our efforts, it is a natural process, occurring<br>
spontaneously, as has been observed historicaly.  But we transhumans are<br>
impatient, and we want to accelerate evolution of intelligence.<br>
