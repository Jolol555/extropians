<i>&gt;&gt; An individual has no hope of being able to bring a revolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; idea to life unless he sells his soul to the company store...</i><br>
<p>
You weren't listening--yes, there will be less profit from<br>
revolutionary ideas from anyone.  I don't give a damn about<br>
revolutionary ideas.  Progress comes from small, evolutionary<br>
improvements and combinations of existing ideas, and it is<br>
those that will flourish in a world where there are no<br>
copyrights and patents to artificially overvalue novelty<br>
for its own sake.<br>
<p>
The myth of the small lone inventor coming up with a unique<br>
and marvellous idea out of nothing in his garage is fairy tale.<br>
A pretty story made up to justify granting state-sanctioned<br>
privilege to those who can afford to speculate irresponsibly<br>
with technology in hope that big brother will secure their<br>
market for them if they get lucky.<br>
<p>
A /true/ creative mind honestly acknowledges that nothing is<br>
created in a vacuum; every "creation" is a synthesis of old<br>
ideas from a thousand sources, and maybe one or two randomly<br>
strewn new ones.  I certainly don't think they have no value,<br>
but nor do I think creativity is anything special.  Anyone<br>
who thinks a creative mind is somehow more worthy of help from<br>
government than a talented athlete, and skilled craftsman,<br>
or even a high-priced hooker is just a snob.  Everyone from<br>
laborers to inventors contributes to the economy, and none<br>
deserve anything they can't get without a forcible monopoly.<br>
