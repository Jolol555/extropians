about any history of the renaissance and military technology would be a good place<br>

<i>&gt; In answer to your question as to why anyone would invent if they did not</i><br>

<i>&gt; from monopoization).</i><br>
<p>
But they wouldn't be getting paid fairly for it. This is about as logical as a<br>
manufacturer only getting paid for some of the product he makes, i.e. not somthing<br>
which should be legislated or forced on someone. Product for which a manufacturer<br>
is not paid, and which he does not willingly donate to charity or give away is<br>
STOLEN. GET IT?<br>
<p>
Also, you are still ignoring my question as to why I or anyone should invent<br>
something to benefit others without our say so as to who can benefit freely from it<br>
and who pays. Anything less is theft.<br>
<p>
All you are doing is akin to an attempt to legislate PI to equal 3. Get off your<br>
subjectivist, post modern butt and pay for what you use. No free lunches.<br>
