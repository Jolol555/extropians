<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And a poor article at that.  Peter Sommer, senior research fellow at the</i><br>
London<br>
<i>&gt; School of Economics says that to hit a major network you need to know</i><br>
"...what<br>
<i>&gt; back-up there is," "You would need to infiltrate someone into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; organisation," and "They would need to know how to write code and</i><br>
introduce it<br>
<i>&gt; onto the system." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do any security experts on this list think that hacking involves back-ups? </i><br>
<i>&gt; that hacking requires a person on the inside?  or that hacking requires code</i><br>
<i>&gt; writing and an entry point to run code on the system?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not a security "expert", but I am a sysadmin at a financial site, so I <br>
do have to deal with security issues.<br>
Back-ups are a critical element in security. If you have backups that can be<br>
trusted, the damage to financial data can be limited to only that which has<br>
changed in the time since the attack. Believe me, having to reenter one day <br>
of data is far better than having to reenter a couple months of it (I've been<br>
through both situations at my current company). If you are trying to nail a <br>
system for the long term rather than just a quick raid that destroys some<br>
data, or causes some action to be taken, the backups are a very high priority<br>
to subvert. If you can put false data into the backups over a period of time<br>
or otherwise make them untrustworthy, that greatly increases the damage to <br>
systems involved in record keeping, or transaction processing. It's less so <br>
for systems that are only involved in control, and don't keep long term<br>
records<br>
but even there, it's a major target. It's far faster to reinstall a complex <br>
system from a full backup, than to reinstall everything piecemeal, and have to<br>
set all the system parameters again.<br>
As to the part about needing to get into the organization to get into the <br>
systems and subvert them, it depends. For most of the sites on the internet,<br>
no. For sites running high level secure systems, provided they aren't making<br>
silly mistakes, it's probably the most straightforward way to get at them. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The article then goes on to dismiss teenage hackers as being "lucky" rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; than skillful when they crack into military computers.  The article</i><br>
dismisses<br>
<i>&gt; Cyber Terrorism as being a "Theoretical Danger", but not actually likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever happen.</i><br>
<p>
There are two parts to my answer to this. Are there dangers? Yes.<br>
But; Are the dangers being inflated? Yes.<br>
Most of the hackers that I've encountered are script kiddies. They use<br>
prepared<br>
scripts to exploit known system weaknesses, and don't really have the info to<br>
find new ones, save through getting lucky. There's a smaller group that do<br>
have<br>
the skills and understanding. If it's a government trying to target your<br>
system<br>
as in true info warfare, that's a whole different ball game, as they have <br>
a lot of resources, and likely will be trying to infiltrate not only your <br>
network, but your organization as well.<br>
I've seen an awful lot of hype about info war and cyber terrorism, and a<br>
lot of <br>
it has come from people who want to sell me, and the company I work for a new<br>
spiffy security system that will solve the problem of all those evil crackers<br>
out there. What I've found is that the best defense is exactly what one of the<br>
people quoted in the article either implies or mentions directly. Thoroughly<br>
trained, alert, and technically skilled admins, combined with<br>
auditing/security <br>
policies that make sure the known holes are plugged, and the users are trained<br>
how not to make the worst of the common security mistakes. <br>
<p>
And would our government make use of fears over this to push key escrow, and<br>
other policies? Well, in light of such things as the CDA, I leave that <br>
as an exercise for the reader. <br>
