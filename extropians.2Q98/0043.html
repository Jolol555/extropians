Indeed you are correct sir. However, I was told that Hemp grows very fast and is<br>
really easy to rotate with other plants to prevent soil sterilization.<br>
<p>
Why is this titled the "great hemp swindle?"<br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure that it would still be one of this country's greatest agricultural<br>
assets if it weren't illegal to grow. (note that hemp and mj are not the same kind<br>
of plant. I guess you could say its similar to a fruitless cherry tree)<br>
<p>
Ask yourself why ALL forms of hemp plants are illegal to grow in this country?!?<br>
<p>
I'm speculating here and I'm sure there are people who have more information, but<br>
there's a lot of reasons why lobbyists from logging, fuel and cotton industries<br>
would love to eliminate a major competitor.<br>
<p>
Personally, I think that its absurd that a plant can be made illegal. But then<br>
again, many native americans were really confused about the idea of land ownership.<br>
