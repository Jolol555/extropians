I've been reading a little about an incredible idea taken very seriously in <br>
the late 50's and early 60's but today is almost completely forgotten, it was <br>
called Project Orion. The idea was to make a spaceship big enough for 150 <br>
people and all the equipment they could ever want and blast it into space.  <br>
They wanted to make it 135 feet in diameter and 160 feet high and they wanted  <br>
most of that space to be usable by people not wasted on fuel. They figured <br>
weight would be no problem, if a crew member wanted to bring along his  <br>
antique bowling ball collection and his own personal barber chair there would  <br>
be no objection. The advocates of this approach were not interested in low <br>
earth orbit or even the moon, they were certain they could be on Mars by 1965 <br>
and Saturn by 1970, the leader of the project was determined to visit Pluto. <br>
And they figured all this would cost less than 10% what the Apollo moon <br>
project did.<br>
<p>
You might think that these people must have been a bunch of crackpots, but  <br>
it's not so. Nobel Prize winners  Niels Bohr, Hans Bethe and Harold Urey were  <br>
all enthusiastic advocates of the idea. Freeman Dyson thought the idea was so  <br>
brilliant that he took a one year leave of absence from the prestigious<br>
Institute of Advanced Study so he could work full time on the project.<br>
<p>
Yes, there is a catch, Project Orion needed nuclear energy, even worse it <br>
needed nuclear bombs. The Orion spacecraft would contain 2000 nuclear bombs, <br>
most in the 20 kiloton range, the size of the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki. <br>
A bomb in a tank of water would shoot out the back of the ship, when it was <br>
100 feet away it would explode, the water would hit a carefully designed <br>
75 ton pusher plate and accelerate the ship. Between the pusher plate and the <br>
ship were 50 foot long gas filled shock absorbers to even out the jerk. They <br>
wanted everything to be as cheap as possible, so they asked the Coca-Cola <br>
company for the blueprints of one of their vending machines, then they scaled <br>
it up a little and planed to use it as the mechanism to dispense the bombs.<br>
                <br>
The pusher plate was obviously the most important part of the design. If you  <br>
explode a powerful bomb near a circular plate of constant thickness it will  <br>
shatter because of the uneven stresses that build up, but it turns out that <br>
if you carefully taper the plate and make certain that the explosion is dead<br>
center, the plate will be extraordinary  resistant to damage. A layer on the <br>
plate will be vaporized by the heat but if some heavy protective oil is <br>
spayed on it before each use it would be good for 2000 blasts. This beast was <br>
tough, if it was properly oriented the Orion Spacecraft could survive a <br>
16 megaton H bomb blast from only two thousand feet away, a fact of more than<br>
passing interest to the military. Orion needed lots of radiation shielding to <br>
protect the crew, but weight was never an issue so this was no problem.<br>
 <br>
Wernher von Braun though all this was a dumb idea, then he saw a movie of the <br>
launch of a one meter working model of Orion that shot 6 carefully timed  <br>
high explosives chemical bombs out the back of the model, it rose 300 feet  <br>
into the air in stable controlled flight. Wernher von Braun became a vocal <br>
supporter of project Orion.<br>
  <br>
They planed to launch Orion from atop eight 250 towers in Jackass Flats  <br>
Nevada. The first bomb would be tiny, just .1 kiloton (100 tons of TNT)  <br>
exploded 100 feet below craft and 150 feet above the ground, then a new and  <br>
slightly larger bomb would be spit out the back every second for 50 seconds, <br>
the last bomb would be the largest, 20 kilotons, and by then the craft would <br>
be out of the atmosphere, the total yield of the 50 bombs would be 200 <br>
kilotons. The launch would have been a spectacular sight, it'd make the Space <br>
Shuttle look like a bottle rocket.<br>
<p>
Project Orion was lead by Ted Taylor, a mediocre physicist but a good <br>
inventor. Taylor had one unique talent, he has been called by some the best <br>
nuclear weapon engineer on planet Earth and the Leonardo da Vinci of nuclear <br>
bomb design. Taylor is the man who figured out how a two foot long 200 pound  <br>
bomb could be made as powerful as the 12 foot long 10 ton World War 2 <br>
Nagasaki bomb. The reason the Orion  spaceship was so much bigger and faster <br>
than anything we have today is that pound for pound such bombs have about a <br>
million times as much energy as any chemical rocket fuel.<br>
<p>
Orion wasn't the only thing Taylor was interested in, he found a way to make  <br>
new type of nuclear bomb, one that would produce a highly directional blast.  <br>
He designed a little one kiloton bomb that could blast a 1000 foot tunnel  <br>
straight through solid rock, he wanted to build a cheap tunnel between  <br>
New York and San Francisco and have a supersonic subway 3000 miles long.  <br>
<p>
Considering the big controversy we had last year when a deep space probe was <br>
launched with just a few pounds of non weapon grade Plutonium on it to power  <br>
the electronics it may seem incredible and irresponsible that anyone would <br>
even consider something as environmentally unfriendly as Orion, but we live <br>
in a very different world. At the time Orion was under serious study the USA <br>
was blowing up one megaton bombs deep under the sea and 300 miles in space <br>
and the USSR was blowing up 57 megaton bombs in the atmosphere, Orion seemed <br>
and indeed was pretty benign compared to that.<br>
<p>
It all came to nothing of course, in 1963 the test ban treaty was signed <br>
stopping all nuclear explosions in space or the atmosphere making Orion  <br>
illegal. The project died, but to this day most say it would have worked  <br>
technologically if not politically.<br>
  <br>
Idea for a science fiction novel: A huge nickel iron asteroid is heading for <br>
Earth, it would take a 200,000 megaton bomb to divert it but no existing <br>
rocket is nearly powerful enough to deliver such a huge payload to the <br>
asteroid. The Earth seems doomed, then our hero remembers Project Orion. <br>
