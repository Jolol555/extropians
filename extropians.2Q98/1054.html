<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; I think "religion" is seeking truth.  Religions have generally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; found it.  Just like "science" seeks knowledge (or the creation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; of theory) and General Relativity has found it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: If science seeks knowledge, does</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    science seek true or false knowledge?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is true or false knowledge? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: A lie constitutes false knowledge.<br>
   A true statement (i.e., a statement that <br>
   maximizes a 100% accurate representation<br>
   of the physical universe or mathematic <br>
   models) constitutes true knowledge.<br>
<p>
   Of course a true statement A, is A relative<br>
   to not-A, hence the false defines the true.<br>
   If all statements were true, they'd just <br>
   be statements (if in U, A = 100% and not-A <br>
   = 0%, A = 0%). While this defines identity-<br>
   union (via mutual identity definition), it<br>
   simultaneously defines identity-difference.<br>
<p>
   We could have a universe of statements where <br>
   all statements were true,  only the secondary<br>
   identity attribute "true" would have no meaning,<br>
   all statements would just be statements, and <br>
   they'd be statements relative to not-statements.<br>
<p>
   If a verbal statement was bereft of internal<br>
   differential attributes, such a tone modulation, <br>
   and thus was like uniform flat-white noise, and <br>
   if there was no time that is was not, then it <br>
   would fall to 0, and would not have measurable <br>
   existence... just like consciousness (null).<br>
<p>
   In short: A, if and only if not-A.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;A theory can explain things to you - but even if it's a very good</i><br>
<i>&gt;explanation, it might turn out to be misleading some day. And a theory</i><br>
<i>&gt;can predict things, more or less accurately. Just because a theory gives</i><br>
<i>&gt;a good explanation or predicts things accurately doesn't mean that it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;"true". If you approach science with the ideal to find truth, you'll</i><br>
<i>&gt;either be very frustrated real soon (because no matter how hard you try,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there's no certainty or truth) OR you may find something that looks like</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth to you, which is even worse. Truth doesn't change, so if you think</i><br>
<i>&gt;you found truth, you can't deal with a new theory that contradicts your</i><br>
<i>&gt;"truth" (but might be a LOT better).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I'd say that avoidance of a theory<br>
  because no evidence to the contrary can<br>
  be found is more worrisome to me than<br>
  the possibility that a given person <br>
  can or cannot handle a new theory.<br>
<p>
  My efforts to map truth have been very <br>
  successful. Efforts of contrarians have<br>
  been very frustrating. So far, no examples<br>
  of an identity or attribute of any identity<br>
  that is not derived from differential relation<br>
  have been found. None. The evidence for holism <br>
  is therefore absolute, and for atomism null,<br>
  the fact that many denounce my theory because<br>
  contrary evidence cannot be found worries me.<br>
<p>
  My theory could be imperfect, no question, but <br>
  100% of evidence says that it's in the ballpark<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    If there are 2 varieties of knowledge,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    and if science is for true knowledge,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    then truth is the true goal of science.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ever read Popper? "Truth" is absolute - science may get better... btw, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think the "true" goals of science have changed during history (so they</i><br>
<i>&gt;never were absolutely true - </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Well, we could change a true statement<br>
   into a false statement, but that does not <br>
   mean it was not a true statement.<br>
<p>
