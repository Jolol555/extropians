<i>&gt; TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life (such as extropian philosophy) that</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeks the continuation and acceleration of the evolution of intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; life beyond its currently human form and human limitations by means of</i><br>
<i>&gt; science and technology, guided by life-promoting principles and values.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Max More, 1990]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You might replace "evolution" by "development"</i><br>
<p>
I'm not suggesting we change any definition, I'm just asking what <br>
short explanation people give when they are asked what is <br>
transhumanism. The above statement is quite good IMHO, but it might <br>
not be the best possible response to give. The following are the <br>
disadvantages I see:<br>
<p>
1. It's a little too long.<br>
<p>
2. As Max suggests, evolution should be replaced with "development".<br>
<p>
3.  "the evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human <br>
form" almost sounds as if it presupposes that intelligent life has <br>
not already evolved beyond its currently human form. However, there <br>
might be very advanced extraterrestrial species.<br>
<p>
4. "life-promoting principles and values". I don't know anybody who <br>
would say of his own values and principles that they are *not* <br>
"life-promoting". It sounds like either empty rethoric or, worse, <br>
like a commitment to the anti-abortion, anti-euthanesia stance.<br>
<p>
5. "by means of science and technology" could perhaps be misconstrued <br>
in a too narrow sense.  Anders tends to stress that not only science <br>
and technology, but also, e.g., psychological techniques and  <br>
institution building, are part of the transhumanists' tool box. <br>
Natasha might add that developing artistic creativity is a <br>
transhumanist way of extending our minds and enriching our lives. <br>
<p>
Okay, I'm really struggling to come up with difficulties here. We <br>
can hardly expect any definition/explanation to say everything we <br>
think is important in just a few words.<br>
<p>
That doesn't mean we can't try :-)  Building on Anders' version, I <br>
suggest the following:<br>
<p>
"Transhumanism is the idea that the human condition will <br>
be dramatically transformed by technology and that it is a good thing<br>
to use rational methods to overcome our biological limitations."<br>
<p>
(Actually, we might need more than one explanation, depending on whom <br>
we are trying to explan it to.)<br>
