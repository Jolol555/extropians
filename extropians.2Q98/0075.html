<i>        &gt;Centralized systems are not inherently bad</i><br>
         <br>
Tell that to the impoverished people of the former USSR.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A centralized system can be benevolent in its intentions, anarchy,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;like nature itself, doesn't give a crap about fairness or individual         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;well-being.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
I'm interested in results, I don't give a damn about intentions. I hope I  <br>
don't come across sounding too cynical but any system that must rely on  <br>
people loving each other is not going to work. The farmer grows my food, the <br>
trucker moves my food and the grocer sells my food, none of these people love <br>
me, yet the free market plunges them into a conspiracy to put food on my <br>
table.    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Anarchy is inherently unstable </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The Internet is an anarchy, it seems to work.<br>
          <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;In other words we want our judges to have a highly developed sense         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;of justice, well it's hard to disagree with that, but the question         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;is how do we  obtain it. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;By selection on the desired criteria, continous training in the most         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;difficult cases, continous surveillance</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Continuos surveillance would be enough to stop most from going into that line        <br>
of work, it would certainly stop me.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>           &gt;(to prevent corruption), excellent pay,        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
High pay won't stop corruption, regardless of how much money you have it's <br>
never enough. In my world you don't need to tack on anti corruption measures, <br>
it's intrinsic to the system. The better job a PPA does, the  more it can <br>
charge. If 10$ more is stolen from me if I stay with PPA #1 rather than <br>
switch to PPA #2 then I will stay with #1 ONLY if they charge 10$ less.<br>
Each dollar stolen from me is equivalent to a dollar stolen directly from the <br>
PPA. For this reason it is in the financial interest of the heads of the PPA <br>
to keep bribery of employees as low as possible. Contrast that to the  <br>
situation today, it doesn't cost the police a dime, regardless of how much is <br>
stolen from me, and they may even make money off my misfortune by receiving  <br>
payoff money from the thief.               <br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Good surveillance brings out the saint in anyone</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'd rather be a sinner.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and all judicial candidates are subject to intensive psychological         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;profiling, not just one but continously.</i><br>
<p>
1) Psychological profiling is crap. <br>
2) Who profiles the psychological profiler?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The free market is no magic bullet, not by far. Many a good product         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;has failed for trivial and/or incomprehensible reasons. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The reasons they failed are often comprehensible and never trivial. For <br>
example, consider the computer you're probably using right now, the one <br>
you're unhappy with. It's true that if you were starting from scratch lots of  <br>
people could make a more consistent, more elegant, system than Wintel, but <br>
Microsoft and Intel didn't have that luxury. Everything they made had to be <br>
compatible with everything they made before, this imposes a severe burden, <br>
but a burden the  most popular operating system in the world MUST bear. <br>
If the Many Worlds Interpretation is correct, I predict that on nearly all <br>
those worlds people are complaining that the most popular operating system is <br>
an ugly mess, a inelegant hodgepodge of kludges. Such is the fate of things <br>
that are not designed all at once but evolve and grow, things like English <br>
with it's weird spelling, or biological organisms for that matter.<br>
<p>
It's in the nature of things that standards are resistant to change, but <br>
that's OK because that is exactly the way a standards should be. The lack of <br>
popularity of the Apple or Next or Bee or whatever operating system is not an <br>
example of market failure because in the context of the real world they are <br>
in fact inferior system. If everything else was equal they would be better <br>
than Wintel but everything else is not equal. These systems have some small <br>
technical advantages but that is countered by enormous practical <br>
disadvantages, they will not operate on the type of computer most people have <br>
and it will not run billions of dollars worth of popular software that took<br>
millions of man years to write. It's perfectly valid to take such things into <br>
account when deciding what system is really  superior. When a standard is set <br>
it's just not worth going to a new one unless you get an  astronomical <br>
improvement. The market has decided that the Apple or Next or Bee is not a <br>
huge advance of that type. Maybe the market is wrong but I know it has a<br>
better understanding of such things than a bunch of hack politicians.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The free market is basically commercial democracy: you let the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;people vote for products.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, there is a fundamental difference. Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of  <br>
communicating your wishes, there are much better ways. Every day I send <br>
hundreds of exquisitely precise messages to the Free Market telling it what I <br>
want it to do. I also get to compare brands, I can't do that In a democracy <br>
because I'm not voting for goods or services or even policies, I just get to<br>
choose between two grab bags of promises every 4 years, and democracy is the <br>
best form of government, the best of a bad lot.<br>
<p>
When I "vote" in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I <br>
always win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate, <br>
the chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not <br>
worth my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the <br>
politician with the best hairdo gets to make the decisions.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;First of all, how do you want to achieve a state of anarchy? After         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;all, the nation states aren't going to roll over and die just like         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't need to achieve it, like it or not I see no way to stop it. I think <br>
we'll soon find out if my optimistic assessment of a world without government <br>
is correct, because I don't see how the traditional nation state can continue <br>
much longer, they will go the way of the city state.<br>
<p>
Nations will die not with a bang but with a whimper because modern worldwide  <br>
communication, cryptography and untraceable digital cash and signatures will  <br>
make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes, the balance is tipping away  <br>
from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader.  <br>
<p>
Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves  <br>
in this brave new world, but making rules is easy, enforcing them is not.  <br>
Short of dismantling the Internet and confiscating all home computers it's  <br>
impossible to dictate what form of encryption or digital cash you must use  <br>
in your home. Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't  <br>
find the  money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would <br>
not work as  people would just switch to a competing currency (untraceable of <br>
course) that  suited their needs better. The tribute that could still be <br>
extracted, like property taxes and building permits, would have to be <br>
increased to astronomic  levels and collected with a heavy hand, I think a<br>
tax revolt would follow.  Without money government will grind to a halt.                                                     <br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;on who will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Nobody wants to get caught up in the slow, expensive court system         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;run by governments. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Yet the only reason these contracts have any value is because there         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is a big government to keep an eye on things, to provide a civilized         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;context.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Except in binding arbitration, when 2 companies go to an arbiter it's like <br>
going to a marriage councilor, they are not legally required to do what the <br>
arbiter says, yet companies almost always do. If it does not then nobody  <br>
would be willing to engage in arbitration with it in the future and that <br>
would put the company in a severe disadvantage.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Centralized governments don't *have* to  be bureaucratic. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think they do, certainly they always have been. If you're a bureaucrat it's <br>
to your interest to increase the bureaucracy, the same is true of your boss.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;"Anarchy" in any form is unstable (it's simply a power vacuum), </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Anarchy means no government, your statement would be true only if government <br>
was the only form of power, fortunately it's not. <br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;As far as I know, no serious democracy has ever decided to kill of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;half (or any substantial portion) of its own people. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have a hunch that tell you nothing about the virtuous nature of democracy     <br>
because the sample size is too small. Democracy is a very rare form of  <br>
government.<br>
             <br>
<i>        &gt;Since there's only your PPA to deal with instead of a huge government         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that's all over I might try to take you out either myself or I may         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;hire as many destitute souls as my budged allows to do it for me. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I would not have dreamed of slandering you, or even set foot outside of my <br>
house if I didn't think my PPA was strong enough to deter you or anybody else  <br>
from killing me. A member being murdered is bad business for a PPA, the <br>
murderer remaining unpunished is VERY bad business for a PPA. If I though <br>
that my PPA  wasn't pulling out all the stops in its investigation of a<br>
murdered member  I'd change my PPA so fast it'd make your head spin. <br>
Incidentally, my PPA  forbids torture but not the death penalty.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;I don't understand. Does everybody get 3 trials, even those found         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;guilty the  first time?                </i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;You:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;No. Unless new hard evidence comes up (before the execution in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;capital cases).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
So I must go to trial 3 times and receive 3 innocent verdicts before I can go <br>
home but if I receive only one guilty verdict I'm dead meat. Doesn't seem  <br>
quite right.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Which decision of the 3 trials do we accept? </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;The one that is best argued and supported by the most/hardest facts.          </i><br>
         <br>
That immediately brings to mind an obvious question, a question I have asked <br>
of you before but received no answer, a question so obvious I won't repeat it.<br>
                                              <br>
