<i>&gt;partial difference if you adopt the (my?) atomism set of definitions</i><br>
<i>&gt;and it is the net difference if you adopt the (your?) holism set of</i><br>
<i>&gt;definitions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, a thought occurred to me today which just might sink zero</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanics as a theory.  (Gasp!)  As we both agree, zero mechanics is</i><br>
<i>&gt;completely compatible with Newtonian mechanics; indeed, this may be zero</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanics's downfall.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Consider objects A and B, which comprise the entire universe.  Imagine for</i><br>
<i>&gt;a moment that when they were at rest they measured each other's lengths</i><br>
<i>&gt;and found that both had the same length.  So their identity chart for</i><br>
<i>&gt;length would look like: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A  B</i><br>
<i>&gt;A  0  0</i><br>
<i>&gt;B  0  0</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is 0 difference between A's length and A's length; nor is there any</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference between A's length and B's length.  The chart sums to zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So far, so good.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now let us suppose that they change their speed relative to each other to</i><br>
<i>&gt;something quite large; 0.6c.  The velocity of A-&gt;B is 0.6c, B-&gt;A is -0.6c. </i><br>
<i>&gt;A-&gt;A = B-&gt;B = 0.  Sum them all, you get zero.  Again, so far, so good. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But let's go back to observing their lengths again.  According to special</i><br>
<i>&gt;relativity, A and B would EACH observe each other's lengths to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;contracted, while their own lengths remained the same (again, relative to</i><br>
<i>&gt;each).  To be precise, A observes B's length to be 80% of what it</i><br>
<i>&gt;once was; B observes A's length to have contracted in the same way.  Let's</i><br>
<i>&gt;call the magnitude of this change C.  Now let's look at our identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;chart:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A  B</i><br>
<i>&gt;A  0 -C</i><br>
<i>&gt;B -C  0</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Motion measures will sum to 0 due to<br>
  the inclusion of direction in the measurement <br>
  of relative velocities such that we will get <br>
  a 25 mph and a -25 mph. In your matrix, the <br>
  relation is size, but only one of two dir-<br>
  ections in size is indicated (smaller, or -), <br>
  and the zero sum (of all valid measurements)<br>
  is thus found in two symmetrical matrices...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;This chart sums to -2C, violating a principle of zero mechanics, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;ruining net identity's whole day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course, so long as we take on an (my) atomistic definition, we're fine. </i><br>
<i>&gt;There is no principle of zero mechanics inherent in atomism, so we avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt;this problem entirely.  Interesting, no? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Both -C (each individual measure of <br>
   foreshortened length) and -2C (their sum) <br>
   are derived by relation to 0 (the 0 point <br>
   of measure, being the observer's ship) and<br>
<p>
       0 - (-2) = +2<br>
      -2 - 0    = -2<br>
<p>
   the net difference between -2 and 0 is zero;<br>
   and thus the inverse matrix is equally true:<br>
<p>
              A  B<br>
           A  0  -<br>
           B  -  0<br>
<p>
<p>
              A  B<br>
           A  +  0<br>
           B  0  +<br>
<p>
   Because size is relative, A appears to in-<br>
   crease in size when measuring B. As A looks<br>
   at B, observer A could equally assume he had <br>
   increased in size just as the observer in one <br>
   train looking at another train next to him out <br>
   the window seeing motion and may assume either<br>
   his train or the other is in motion, and either<br>
   assumption is equally correct. Observer B also<br>
   assumes he may have increased in size. So net <br>
   difference is found in the sum of the matrices.<br>
   One size-matrix doesn't contain all difference.<br>
<p>
         larger (+) &lt;---0---&gt; (-) smaller<br>
<p>
   Dan, it's a great counter(!) worthy of further<br>
   investigation, but it can only be sustained if <br>
   it can be shown that size is not relative and <br>
   thus that one matrix is more valid, but even <br>
   that "more vs less" valid is another 0 sum.<br>
