Actually I think we are trying to discuss the transition period, and not<br>
the posthuman period. The idea is to figure out how to get from here to<br>
there while minimizing "bad things" and mazimizing "good things'. I agree<br>
that discussing posthuman government is silly--ants discussing the constitution.<br>
<p>
IMO, it is also dumb to consider any radical change to the current world<br>
order, because the transition will be complete before any major human governmental<br>
can have a positive effect. Thus, we should consider high-value short-payback<br>
changes, and perhaps ways to ameliorate the "bad things" that may occur<br>
as part of the transition. I do feel that we need to avoid ireversable<br>
information loss (species extinctions, loss of ecosystems) to the extent<br>
possible, but other long-term problems can be deferred until posthumanity<br>
is available to deal with them. We should also attempt to minimize the <br>
time until the singularity, to mininimize the era in which the "bad things"<br>
occur.<br>
