I usually assume that small firms are (if anything) *more* responsive to<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, my system would have a military, but this would not be the only armed</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; balance. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But all ultimately under the same command, unlike PPAs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, the system relies heavily on the competence and benevolence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the leader ....</i><br>
<p>
"A system that depends on the right man is a wrong system."  (Milton<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; We have minimum wage because if you would go much lower people would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; starving.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Who would accept a wage that doesn't pay for the food to supply enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; energy to go to work??</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's the way it often was in ye olde days (still in this century, mind you),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that's the way it *still* is in many 3rd world and even not-so-3rd-world</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries around the globe. Many people simply don't have a choice</i><br>
<i>&gt; (or at least they firmly belief that they don't have a choice) and those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't add to their insufficient income by such things as begging, stealing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &amp; hustling will ultimately get too weak to work and die.</i><br>
<p>
So how are Third World populations growing?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You can't legislate a living wage.  You can only forbid people to accept</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a wage that you think is too low.  How on earth does that benefit them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How is it better to have NO wages than to be working for less than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; average politician would accept?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, it's not that bad: minimum wage means that corporations, shops etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a (high profile) reputation to hold up will pay more than they would other-</i><br>
<i>&gt; wise to their workers (think Mc Donalds and such),</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure I understand.  Do you mean McDonald's, as a matter of<br>
pride, pays all its workers some amount more than the minimum (always<br>
staying a little bit ahead as the politicians jack it up)?  Or do you<br>
mean merely that without a minimum Ebenezer Scrooge can hold his head<br>
high in public?<br>
<p>
(Ebenezer Scrooge is a miser in a book by Charles Dickens; I have no<br>
idea how well-known it is outside the Anglophone world)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and that those who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to work for less can still sneak into a sweatshop or some other kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "illegal" work.</i><br>
<p>
Where instead of being able to turn to the police if their employers<br>
abuse them (e.g. by not paying wages when due), they must hide FROM the<br>
police.  Wonderful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Otherwise, more people would be badly paid then today;</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies need a minimal x amount of workers, and minimum wage is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between 10 reasonably paid workers or 30 badly underpaid workers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; So those who *do* have a legit job benefit directly, and those who don't can</i><br>
<i>&gt; still find (illegal) work anyway.</i><br>
<p>
So you advocate a system in which a minimum wage is legislated but not<br>
enforced?  Or selectively enforced?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Oy vey.  If anarcho-capitalism depends on everybody's goodwill, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what?  If that's a serious flaw then we're in deep trouble, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; DAILY LIFE IN ANY SYSTEM depends on everybody's goodwill to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; degree.  Every single person in several counties is betting that I (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the rest of our neighbors) won't steal a car tonight and go burn their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; house down.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh really, well I guess we don't need the police then. Or PPAs for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter. Hey, all's cool if you can trust your fellow man. Needless to say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it ain't so, we *don't* trust eachother and have good reason for it too.</i><br>
<p>
Don't we?  You trust the pedestrians on the street not to stab you.  You<br>
trust the waiters at restaurants not to poison you.  You trust your<br>
neighbors not to rob you (have you never lent your key to a neighbor to<br>
feed your cat while you're away?).<br>
<p>
If we did not mostly trust each other, crime would be largely<br>
impossible!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The state is a product of the fact that on one hand we need a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; co-operation to thrive, while at the other hand we don't trust eachother</i><br>
<i>&gt; very much. The state is the context wherein civilization can exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; PPAs are basically just small, weak states, and will therefore have</i><br>
<i>&gt; more limited means to uphold law and order (not to mention a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasant environment).  ...</i><br>
<p>
We have government (in the broad sense which includes PPAs, contracts,<br>
custom etc) to protect us against a TINY MINORITY of badguys.  The<br>
state, which depends for its livelihood on a public perception of its<br>
necessity, puffs itself up by exaggerating what threats exist (Saddam is<br>
going to conquer the world if we don't get him!) and inventing new ones<br>
(pornography on the internet! protect our children!).<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; Also, in anarchy there *may* be a better balance of power, so the chances</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a _big_ dictator kills you may be smaller, but the chances that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "local" one will do it, or just any guy with a gun, are far greater.</i><br>
<p>
A couple of interesting data:<br>
Most ethnic groups in the USA are *less* violent than their home<br>
countries.  (Sorry I can't recall where I heard this)<br>
The state where it's easiest to carry a gun (Vermont) has very low<br>
crime.  States that have recently made it easier, like Florida, have<br>
falling crime rates.<br>
<p>
I'll take my chances with "just any guy with a gun," thank you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In any case, anarchy inevitably leads to structure,</i><br>
<p>
Says who?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and structure leads to centralism.</i><br>
<p>
Oh dear, not you too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why not skip the decades or centuries of little wars and</i><br>
<i>&gt; annexations and go right to the final product?</i><br>
<p>
World wars?<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or by taking power away from the politicians; private parties, spending</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their own money, have no reason to take bribes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wherever there's an organized structure of some kind and capitalism, there will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be bribes.</i><br>
<p>
Bribes to hired managers, yes, but with private ownership there's always<br>
a boss who has a motive to stamp out bribery.<br>
<p>
Suppose I'm a robber and you're a police captain.  I offer you $100 a<br>
week to ensure that I won't be arrested for any crimes in your precinct<br>
(I steal $1000 in an average week).  Unless you have strong moral<br>
scruples, you accept:  the stuff I steal doesn't come out of your pocket<br>
-- on the contrary, if my robberies make the news, you may get a bigger<br>
budget.<br>
<p>
But suppose you're a PPA owner.  If I steal $1000 from your customers,<br>
they (in aggregate) find your services worth $1000 less than otherwise. <br>
You may even be obliged by contract to pay for those losses (an<br>
insurance structure).  So you won't accept my bribe unless it's more<br>
than $1000, which of course I won't offer.<br>
<p>
Now suppose you're a middle manager at a PPA.  You feel underpaid, so<br>
you accept my $100.  Now your boss, the owner, finds that your<br>
department is $1000 less profitable than before.  You run a substantial<br>
risk of being fired for incompetence, even if the bribe is never<br>
discovered.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, but if you like it, it probably wasn't crap in the first place. I meant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; *real* crap, like food so full of conservatives that you'll develop cancer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; over time, or a television set with lousy sound etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There are civil remedies for such things.  Political control over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; market cannot prevent them; it can only ensure that they happen more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; often.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Civil remedies still depend on a government to enforce them.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, in the broad sense: government may include the State, but it also<br>
includes custom and contract, even if there are no private enforcement<br>
agencies.  There are *still* small societies where enforcement is<br>
entirely private, ad hoc.<br>
<p>
Who enforces treaties?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, "political control over the market" doesn't have to the communist</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of meddling, it can simply mean that useful new products may get some</i><br>
<i>&gt; extra help, and that there's a state-sanctioned "seal of quality" so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you know what products meet minimum standards, or are outright good,</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a single glance.  Products don't *have* to have this seal (and the testing</i><br>
<i>&gt; that comes with it), but buying them is at your own risk of course, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; products backed by the state entitle you to damages &amp; refunds etc, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; case of a failure. The damages etc. are split between state (and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; financial repercussions for the responsible government workers) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the producer of the goods. This way, everybody is motivated to deliver</i><br>
<i>&gt; a quality service.  ...</i><br>
<p>
A good scheme, but why can't it all be done privately?  Jews who keep<br>
kosher already look for the mark of a certain council of rabbis, for<br>
example.<br>
<p>
[gradual transition]<br>
<i>&gt; Somewhere there must be a breaking point where politicians are no</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer in control. Yes, it could work out OK, but it will be quite hard</i><br>
<i>&gt; to dismantle such a venerable tradition. And what will happen to</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the former gov employees,</i><br>
<p>
Those who provide genuine services (as opposed to spending their lives,<br>
and ours, *preventing* services) will find markets for their rare<br>
expertise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; who will get the army hardware, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; _nukes_ etc. Who will get the White House? Bill Gates?</i><br>
<p>
Who cares?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does he buy the nukes too (wholesale style), and a couple o' carriers</i><br>
<i>&gt; too when he's at it?</i><br>
<p>
Such worries are misplaced.  Before long, every tycoon will be able to<br>
*make* nukes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course he would have to share with some other</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealthy folks, and maybe he would be poor by then, but in any case</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can well imagine a Russian scenario where former politicians and</i><br>
<i>&gt; bureaucrats sneak back under different "names" into the positions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of power, packed with cash made from the privatization process.</i><br>
<p>
I like to think that our institutions are open enough, and our people<br>
are idealistic (naive?) enough, that such corruption would not be so<br>
easy here.  We have institutions against corruption; they're far from<br>
perfect, but they're more than Russia ever had.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also I can imagine all sorts of mafia types having a ball, no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; hampered by even token government intervention. What is stopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; them from creating a new order under a different name and sucking</i><br>
<i>&gt; the people dry in only slightly different ways. Will the raw intellect</i><br>
<i>&gt; and bold dedication of Jack the Lad be able to stop them? Uh oh...</i><br>
<p>
(who?)<br>
<p>
There's a novel, by the way, in which a Mafia takeover is portrayed as a<br>
good thing: THE SYNDIC by Cyril Kornbluth.  I didn't find it entirely<br>
satisfying - for one thing, the Mafia appear to be monopolists in all<br>
the things you'd expect a state to do, while insisting that they're not<br>
a government.<br>
<p>
Perhaps part of the message of THE SYNDIC is that no matter what the<br>
system is, people will get used to it and find retroactive<br>
justifications for it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And then there's the problem that the transition from governments to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a free market world can never happen all over at the same time. Some</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas will simply be left out, and without western backing any hint</i><br>
<i>&gt; of fair rule will quickly fade from the less developed countries all over</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world. Their dictators will be quite interested in all the formerly</i><br>
<i>&gt; classified hardware and expertise that suddenly hits the market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Saddam: "bring on the nukes! I have oil, you have weapons and</i><br>
<i>&gt; people to operate them -- we trade". Ok, business is business.</i><br>
<p>
On the other hand, J.Storrs Hall sketched a private nuclear insurance<br>
against war (is that essay still somewhere in ExI archives?).  The<br>
insurer gives potential aggressors a list of its clients, and promises<br>
that if any of them is damaged by attack, the attacker's capital will<br>
glow in the dark.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What if we buy off the politicians?  Tell them:  "You deserve to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; taken out and shot, but that's a lot of trouble, so instead we're going</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to give you all the gold you can carry, and a one-way ticket to any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other continent."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, what continent would that be? And guess who its new rulers would be?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe they'll all go to Switzerland.  Maybe they'll go to Africa, and<br>
bring First World delicacy to the dictatorship business.  ;)  Either<br>
way, not my problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, we *will* buy them out, in a way, like the Russian people did</i><br>
<i>&gt; with their politicians (only, those stayed of course).</i><br>
<p>
Ex-politicians won't be a problem if, by then, the people have learned a<br>
healthy and sophisticated distrust of them.  (A long task, I admit.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Around here, I often see stickers on shop windows saying "protected by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; XYZ Security" - some private firm which, when it hears an alarm, sends a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; couple of goons.  And it's not the same firm whose sticker is on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shop next door.  It helps if such firms are friendly with each other,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but they obviously needn't have all the business in town.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a major difference between present-day security firms and PPAs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; since the former work within the framework that's maintained by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; state, and the latter *are* the state. The main reason why you can have</i><br>
<i>&gt; competing security firms working in relative harmony on the same turf</i><br>
<i>&gt; is because they would get busted by Big Brother if they tried to "take"</i><br>
<i>&gt; a region by force, and kicked out the competition. With BB gone, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; a whole new ballgame.</i><br>
<p>
I have more faith in human nature.  With Big Brother gone, so long as no<br>
one PPA controls more than about 1/3 of the available force (which<br>
includes individuals with guns, not just other organized PPAs), it has<br>
to worry that if it turns tyrannical ALL THE OTHERS will gang up and put<br>
it out of business.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's not unlikely that criminal organizations, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer able to profit from illegal drug trade after the state's demise,</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be among the first PPAs. A couple of gangs, or devisions of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same gang, could devide a city and treat the people in it more like</i><br>
<i>&gt; slaves than as customers.</i><br>
<p>
James Donald (whom I know from talk.politics.libertarian etc) says that<br>
some gangs specialize in providing security services (and perhaps<br>
adjudication, i dunno) to drug dealers.  He says of one such gang, whose<br>
name I have alas forgotten, that so long as they stuck to the customary<br>
business of terrorizing ordinary people, the police tolerated them; but<br>
when they shifted to providing actual services to willing customers, Big<br>
Brother smashed them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why would they [the military] suddenly become less ethical if they shared the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; business with other firms?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because the military as we know it would be gone in anarcho-capitalism (who's</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to pay for a huge standing army that offers no direct protection), and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; new PPA enforcers would generally be of a different breed than the patriotic</i><br>
<i>&gt; young men in the regular army.  ...</i><br>
<p>
I should bloody well hope so.  When I was a lad, the thought of going<br>
into the military (or the police force) repelled me because I knew that<br>
I'd be required to do some things I find morally abhorrent.  It<br>
certainly does not comfort me to know that such institutions are<br>
entirely staffed by people who lack my moral scruples.<br>
<p>
They are controlled by officers who, by temperament (pre-selection) and<br>
training, think in terms of command and obedience.  As David Friedman<br>
put it, their jobs are clearly marked "nobody but control freaks need<br>
apply."  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, their conscience (that of the regular soldier) is stopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; them from turning on their own people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do people lose their conscience when they work in the private sector?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some certainly do, and often it's a different kind of people that is attracted</i><br>
<i>&gt; to PPA work. I would expect a greater number of "brown shirts" (bullies</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are only tough enough to terrorize unarmed or badly armed people) in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; PPA business, while the army is more about patriotism, courage and honor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (at least they *try* to keep up this image).</i><br>
<p>
Oh?  I thought it was about earning money for higher education.  ;)<br>
<p>
In the United States, private citizens (including private armed guards)<br>
shoot far more badguys than the police do -- and they shoot the wrong<br>
person far *less* often.  I keep forgetting the ratio, but it's between<br>
three and eleven.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; A few months ago, a boy about 17 was herding goats one evening on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Rio Grande (border with Mexico), and shot at something.  We'll never</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know why he fired (rabbit? coyote?), because four Marines sneaking about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; - looking for drug smugglers - assumed he was firing at them, stalked</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; him for twenty minutes (during which he apparently was oblivious to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them) and killed him.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know what really went down there, of course, but people have always</i><br>
<i>&gt; been somewhat more trigger happy when the target is of a different ethnic</i><br>
<i>&gt; background, and of course assholes can be found in any organization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The same guys could just as well 've been working for a local PPA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If a client complaints about mexicans in his neighborhood the PPA people</i><br>
<i>&gt; will probably shoot them just as easy as any Marine would.</i><br>
<p>
And would answer to other PPAs on a charge of murder.<br>
<p>
Those Marines, I'll bet, will never get more than a reprimand.  They are<br>
protected by the mystique of the uniform: the institutions are reluctant<br>
even to investigate the possibility that they did wrong, because their<br>
commander (who may have a friend in Congress) is sure to whine about how<br>
unfair it is that these fine boys, who sacrificed a promising career in<br>
burglary or bar-bouncing to serve their country, should be "persecuted"<br>
for just trying to do their jobs, fighting the good fight to keep<br>
America free of those who would corrupt our children with pornography --<br>
er, drugs ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Something like it is common in "primitive" societies; indeed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; definition of "primitive society" seems to be "stateless society".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, makes you think, doesn't it? Maybe it just doesn't work for more</i><br>
<i>&gt; advanced societies (or at least it seems that centralization plays</i><br>
<i>&gt; a crucial role in the development of modern nations).</i><br>
<p>
Or maybe parasites are attracted to rich societies, and they've left<br>
these obscure exceptions alone until recently.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Iceland relied entirely on private enforcement for centuries, and was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; generally peaceful.  (The sagas, which concentrate on violence, tell of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; years going by between events in the bitterest feuds.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But will it work for a technologically advanced society? I'd hate to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; a return to hunter-gatherer communities or something like that...</i><br>
<p>
Iceland was never a hunter-gatherer society.  Its first inhabitants were<br>
Irish monks; they were displaced (killed? we'll never know) by Norse<br>
farmers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Where the central authorities are relatively benign, they will probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; last longer; where they are recognized openly as tyrants and thieves,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they will soon be gone, as already in Northern Somaliland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And have things actually gotten better since then?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I hear, it's peaceful there, and Boosaaso (aka Bender Qaasim,</i><br>
a coast town) is developing as a trade center.  They've got a hollow<br>
"state" to show to foreigners who might otherwise be tempted to insist<br>
on giving them one, but it has no real power.  --There may be an article<br>
on www.isil.org.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Apparently the system is doing fine even without hew laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I sure don't see any coup d'etats in the USA...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Then you haven't heard about how the politicians have taken to wiping</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their backsides with the Bill of Rights?  We don't need coups d'etat, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have tyranny coming in the front door in the name of "national security"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and "protecting our children" and "preventing terrorism" and all that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; baloney.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed, most of that is pure crap, but at least you can still openly say so</i><br>
<i>&gt; without risking jail or worse ;-)</i><br>
<p>
Even that is dubious.  If you say too loudly that the War On Minority<br>
Drugs is evil, your door will be broken down.  Unless of course you're<br>
conspicuously and unquestionably conventional in all else, like<br>
WFBuckley or the scattering of anti-prohibition politicians.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Needless to say, I would get rid of unnecessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; bureaucracy if I could, few people hate it more than myself.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; (Last week I was required to show my state-issued portrait before using</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an air ticket.  What in the name of little green apples is this supposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to accomplish?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess they were looking for terrorists then...or maybe even worse: potheads!</i><br>
<p>
Well they let at least one pothead slip through.  ;)  If I were a<br>
genuine terrorist, wouldn't I have six forged passports with six<br>
different names?<br>

My friend George O'Brien offered the opinion that such harassment is<br>
meant to convey the message "we're in charge, so shut up and obey."  The<br>
more of this crap I have to endure, the more compliant I supposedly<br>
become, by force of habit.  (Neil Smith suggested that the same is true<br>
of the semiannual time-change.)<br>
