At present, one of my ventures is in a patent dispute with a large,<br>
government connected corporation. They filed a patent on a concept we<br>
developed some time before we filed, but after they could have seen some of<br>
our preliminary work. We have spent five years developing this technology,<br>
and they would like to legally steal it. By the way - our patent was issued,<br>
and they brought an 'interference' suit to force the PTO to decide who is<br>
legally entitled to coverage.<br>
<p>
As long as it takes large amounts of capital to develop a patent or<br>
copyrighted work, we will need this protection, as unscrupulous persons are<br>
then free to let you do the designing and then sell your idea without giving<br>
you any value.<br>
<p>
When anyone can make anything instantly, and no one has to earn money to<br>
survive, then copyrights and patents can be dispensed with, and there will<br>
be no business or commerce at all.<br>

Do a web search on 'Non Lethal Tecjnologies' (us) and 'Jaycor' (them) to see<br>
what is under fire..<br>
