Yes, you have a lingual problem. It should be perfectly obvious that Daniel<br>
did not mean that he likes to go around forcing people to recant their<br>
religious beliefs at the point of a gun. What he meant by "militant" is no<br>
different from the way it is standardly used: it means you like to pick a<br>
fight. The kind of fights some atheists like to pick are<br>
verbal/intellectual fights, not physical ones.<br>

<p>
Sure, Erik.<br>
<p>
BTW, if you're militantly anti-Extropian, you don't belong on this<br>
particular email list. It's intended for Extropians and fellow travellers.<br>
You're completely free to criticize extropian thinking elsewhere, such as<br>
the Transhuman list, but it's not the function of *this* list.<br>
