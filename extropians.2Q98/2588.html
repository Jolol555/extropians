Abstract<br>
  Agents known or believed to be carcinogenic decrease the concentration of<br>
  potassium and increase the concentration of sodium in the<br>
  cells. Anticarcinogenic agents have the opposite effect. In all cases where<br>
  we have information on an agent's carcinogenicity or anticarcinogenicity and<br>
  on that agent's effects on cellular potassium and sodium<br>
  concentrations the above relationships have been found to be true. Dietary<br>
  carcinogenic agents studied include sodium, cadmium, fat, cholesterol,<br>
  calories, and alcohol; dietary anticarcinogenic agents include<br>
  potassium, vitamins A, C, and D, selenium, and fiber. The<br>
  effect of calcium intake is less clear as that effect depends on the<br>
  concentrations on sodium and potassium. Not only dietary<br>
  agents but also other carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic agents work in the<br>
  same way. The cancer-causing drug dimethylhydrazine increases sodium and<br>
  decreases potassium in the cells, whereas, for example,<br>
  indomethacin, an anticarcinogen, has the opposite effect. In aging<br>
  potassium leaves the cells, sodium enters them, and the<br>
  rates of cancer increase. Patients with hyperkalemic diseases (Parkinson,<br>
  Addison) have reduced cancer rates, and patients with hypokalemic diseases<br>
  (alcoholism, obesity, stress) have increased cancer rates. [References: 12]<br>
