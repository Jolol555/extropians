Brent Allsop &lt;allsop@swttools.fc.hp.com&gt; said:<br>

<i>&gt;Good is good and bad is bad in my book.  There can be no</i><br>
<i>&gt;twisting of one into the other.  I seek after and hope for perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt;goodness and make no attempts to justify any evil.  Any belief or</i><br>
<i>&gt;acceptance of any idea or words like "we must allow some evil" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;faithlessly giving up in despair to me.  My hope and desire is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;never give up until all evil is overcome.  It is not consistent to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have such a hope and to believe in a God.</i><br>
<p>
Surely good and evil are relative terms? A person's action is not<br>
_absolutely_ good or bad - it depends on things like your belief<br>
system, emotional state etc. Say an alien race comes along to<br>
Earth tomorrow, and after initial contact problems (their universal<br>
translator is on the blink) they tell us that our Sun must be removed;<br>
in 20,000 years it will come too close to a star they have a<br>
population centre at. This would be bad for us Earthlings, but good<br>
for the alien race.<br>
<p>
Okay, so there are some flaws in this hypothetical situation, but you<br>
must see my point. You are arguing that two human created<br>
concepts are proof that another human creation - gods - do not<br>
exist. There are far better ways to do that.<br>
