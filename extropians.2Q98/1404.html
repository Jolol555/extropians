I imagine you are referring to radiation due to blue shift and collisions<br>
with energetic particles, not just energy for the drive..<br>
<p>
Multigeneration ships always bring to mind a story I read years ago - the<br>
occupants of such a ship forgot they are on a ship, and evolve a society and<br>
religions to explain the ship's existence. (No, NOT the Star Trek episode..)<br>
<p>

<p>
I for one find the idea of being trapped on a cruise liner for 500 years<br>
horrifying. The ship would have to be a small planet to provide enough<br>
diversions for that long. I suppose that one could retreat into virtual<br>
reality for some different experiences..<br>
<p>
Would advances in cryonics give us the 'long sleep' seen in '2001' and other<br>
science fiction, so that we wake at the destination or in case of some<br>
interesting occurance during the trip?<br>
