The authors of the review are implicitly assuming that the <br>
overall nature of population economics does not change <br>
dramatically from it's nature over the last century or so.<br>
<p>
If you think that great fundamental change is likely over<br>
the next century, you don't want to take such forecasts <br>
literally.  But neither do you want to ignore what economists<br>
have learned. <br>
<p>
I think that the farther out you want to forecast, the more<br>
you want to rely on basic economic theory, in contrast to more <br>
empirical methods.  You use current and past data to infer <br>
what the fundamental processes are, and then then use your <br>
best models of those fundamental processes to infer some <br>
broad consequences of new technologies.  <br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by "quantitative", but I am <br>
confident that we do understand enough about fundamental <br>
economic processes to say interesting things about the future.<br>
The problem is that very few economists have the hubris to<br>
think carefully about the question, and very few people with <br>
the hubris and interest to think carefully about the future <br>
(like those on this list) know much economics. <br>
