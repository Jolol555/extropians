At 03:50 5/3/98 -0400, you wrote:<br>

<i>&gt;There's ways around this, too.  Currently we have fraud laws for this sort</i><br>

<i>&gt;"If this is snake oil, this here arbitration company will recompense you</i><br>
<i>&gt;what it costs you, at my expense.")</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
That sounds good to me..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Without the patent, anyone who wants to make knock-off copies of our product</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is free to do so, and piggyback on our market research and development. We</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sweat, they gain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, the problem is this:  under a lf-capitalist market, invention has</i><br>
<i>&gt;lots of positive externalities.  After all, you DO gain from the invention,</i><br>
<i>&gt;just as much as your competitor did, but you also had to bear the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt;invention.  When you give the inventor monopoly status, however, you cut</i><br>
<i>&gt;off those positive externalities and allow the inventor to set prices</i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrarily high without fear that some pesky competitor will offer the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same product at a lower price.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Please define these 'externalities'. I still don't see how I benefit to have<br>
my market stolen from me..<br>
<p>
If I set my prices arbitrarily high, I limit my sales to those for whom<br>
money is no object. This is a very small market. If I charge a reasonable<br>
price for my invention, based on its' costs and a fair payment to me for the<br>
development, I should have more takers.<br>
<p>
In the case of our products, the market is fairly small and specialized. One<br>
competitior stealing our ideas and undercutting us would ruin the whole<br>
works for us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So it seems to me that we're choosing between an accidental good and,</i><br>
<i>&gt;apparently, a deliberate bad.</i><br>
<p>
I still don't see the 'bad'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Anyway, it's darn hard to encrypt a mostly physical device..We don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the replicator, yet..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The encryption is used for the invention, for the sales of the first idea,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not for the product.  The premise that you could have lots of people know a</i><br>
<i>&gt;piece of information and still sell it as if you were the only one is one</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the fallacies which copyright tends to prop up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The rewards are for the initial creation of the information, not knowledge<br>
of same. You seem to be saying that the creators deserve no rewards for<br>
their thinking!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;What is to stop anyone who wants to reverse engineer the product and tool up</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to make copies? Their overhead is now less by all the time spent in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;original development, so they can sell for less. This would quickly dry up</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;any investment capital for R+D of anything other than software with strong</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;encoding. Who wants to risk development time and money if anyone is welcome</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to steal it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You still benefit from the invention in the form of the new market you've</i><br>
<i>&gt;just created or in the increased demand for your products.  The fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;your competitor will also benefit does not detract from this.  Thus, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;long as you still make a profit from the invention, it's still worthwhile</i><br>
<i>&gt;to pay for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I beg to differ. As I stated earlier, if the market is small, you are<br>
seriously harmed by knock-off competetion.<br>
<p>
If you build a mansion, will you be disturbed if I decide to move in with my<br>
family and use it? If not, let me know where you live...<br>
