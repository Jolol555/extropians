  IAN: I don't think that the above is mysterious,<br>
  occultic or most things that might be inferred<br>
  from the term "cryptic." The post pertains to <br>
  expressing the categories stated as sets to<br>
  define their exact relations to one another.<br>
  Of course, not following the thread could <br>
  cause such a "cryptic impression." I do<br>
  try to say the most I can with the least. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you a cryonicist? Your website writings indicate that your</i><br>
<i>&gt;personal beliefs tend towards acceptance of, how can I say it, </i><br>
<i>&gt;the supernatural. That would be unusual for a cryonicist.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: The Random House Webster's College Dictionary<br>
  defines "supernatural" as "of, pertaining to, or being<br>
  above what is natural or explainable by natural law."<br>
  Also noted is occult, ghosts, Gods, deities... I don't<br>
  believe I have promoted a belief in any thing that<br>
  was above any or beyond any natural physical law. <br>
<p>
  Of course my holistic philosophy may be seen as <br>
  supernatural to believers in atomistic identity,<br>
  even as they cannot support a view contrary to<br>
  holism with a single item of physical evidence.<br>
  I believe that atomist identity is supernatural.<br>
  The identity that is what it is free from holistic <br>
  relation is even more fallacious than Gods and ghosts,<br>
  since the later at least have existence in the mind,<br>
  yet the free identity cannot even exist in the mind.<br>
