What it all boils down to is that any rational person (including transhumanists<br>
who after all emphasize rationality quite heavily) will use any means that<br>
are available to him to reach his goals. Sometimes his actions will benefit<br>
others, sometimes they will be neutral, and sometimes people will get hurt.<br>
A rational person will recognize that most ethics and morals are nothing<br>
but artificial (extra) burdens on the way to ascension. Life is difficult enough<br>
as it is. Castigating yourself with piontless self-imposed rules and <br>
regulations is pure S&amp;M.<br>
<p>
Knowing this is being on the right path to enlightenment.<br>
<p>
Ah, you might say, that would mean folks like Hitler, Stalin, the IRA and<br>
any damn street robber are enlightened. Not so. The other part of enlighten-<br>
ment is seeking technotranscendence (immortality, increased intelligence,<br>
physical strenght etc. through rational means like technology). To achieve <br>
this one needs a lot of foresight, which includes keeping a relatively low profile <br>
and (thus) minimizing the number of (potentially) dangerous enemies. Also, <br>
being nice can pay off in several ways, ranging from simply "a good feeling" to <br>
substantial material gain.<br>
<p>
So there's a rational basis for being generally nice. But, unlike many less<br>
user friendly philosophies Enlightened Rationalism (TM)* does not forbid the <br>
use of force, including the use of force "just for fun". It just says "keep an <br>
eye on the consequences", which is, wel...rational. So if you feel like it, and<br>
think that you can get away with it...by all means go ahead!<br>
<p>
All this may sound ok for individual use, but would this work for society as a <br>
whole? Yes. Most people are not "evil" by nature. Just a bit opportunistic,<br>
which is only rational. A society based on Enlightened Rationalism (TM) <br>
would rid itself of the true assholes quite quickly and then become stable<br>
and pleasant to live in, free of such nonsense as the war on drugs and<br>
the persecution of victimless crime in general. After all, most problems<br>
are caused by ridiculous, sanctimonious rules and standards, and people<br>
not being able to live up to them an getting frustrated because of it.<br>
Setting the morals too high only breeds corruption, lies and blackmail,<br>
and sooner or later those who helped to perpetuate the system will be<br>
eaten by it themselves.<br>
<p>
Of course "society" isn't going to adopt this kind of rational thinking anytime<br>
soon, which is too bad for them but doesn't matter otherwise since E.R. is<br>
highly suited to be practiced on an individual basis in a "hostile" environment.<br>
<p>
Well, enough wisdom for one day...<br>
<p>
<p>
(*) To recap: Enlightened Rationlism (TM) is a branch on the transhumanistic <br>
tree. It supports all basic tenets of regular transhumanism/extropianism except <br>
those that unreasonably limit the freedom of the (rational) individual. For example,<br>
E.R. is neutral on the issues of increasing diversity and being "life promoting".<br>
These are matters of individual choice and depend on the situation. E.R. supports <br>
no existing political party or movement, and is not compatible with any [other] <br>
political or religious philosophies. Enlightened Rationalists seek to become <br>
Powers, but also try to make the most of (have fun) all the intermediate phases.<br>
<p>
Btw, suggestions for a better sounding name are welcome; "Enlightened <br>
Rationalism" is too long and sounds too pompous-assed.<br>
