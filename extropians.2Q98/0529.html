As long as curves are gentle in relation to the speeds involved, they should<br>
not be a problem as long as a maglev style suspension is used. The tube<br>
would need some pretty good bracing to survive the side thrusts for anything<br>
other than a really gentle curve, though. Obviously, rugged freight or bulk<br>
materials could take much sharper curves than passengers!<br>
<p>
One thing that would be a concern here is how much energy would be absorbed<br>
by the levitation system. If you compress a levitating magnet using the<br>
Meissner effect, you are adding energy to the system. There has to be a<br>
limit to how much you can add for a given setup. Maybe it's just a matter of<br>
proper design for a safety margin?<br>
