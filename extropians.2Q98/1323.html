I sometimes use anthropomorphic words when writing about physical processes <br>
and will continue to do so, naturally they should not be taken literally.<br>

<p>
<p>
I don't know what "colititional" means but I do know that if what we do is <br>
non random then it has a cause, if it's random  then it doesn't.                 <br>

<i>        &gt;This quality of originating volitional consciousness we call         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;'sentience.'     </i><br>
<p>
<p>
So, you're saying consciousness is sentience and sentience is consciousness.  <br>
Sorry but with that definition and 50 cents you can buy a can of Coke.<br>

It can't, but what does that have to do with the price of eggs? <br>
I specifically  said that an intelligent person or animal or machine <br>
analyzing its input data has survival value.<br>
        <br>

<i>        &gt;All animals are sentient </i><br>

Interesting theory. I have a theory too, Chuck Kuecker is sentient, but I  <br>
can't prove it and never will.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We need better definitions here..</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No we do not. There will never be a definition of "consciousness" that's <br>
worth a damn, trying to come up with one is a waste of time. I'm certainly <br>
not saying the word is trivial or meaningless however because definitions are <br>
not the only or even the  most important way we communicate. Most words and <br>
concepts, and all of the really important ones, are made clear to us by <br>
example not by definitions. As a result I note that other people usually <br>
use the word "consciousness" in much the same way I do, but if you put a gun <br>
to my head I couldn't define it, I'd just know that if you pulled the trigger <br>
I'd lose it forever.<br>
