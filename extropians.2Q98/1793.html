I agree.  A friend of mine has 3 kids, all of which are home schooled.  The<br>
oldest is 12 years old and shows a maturity that is completely uncharacteristic<br>
of others that age.  Same goes for the 9 and 7 year-old.  At least once a week,<br>
they go out and do some kind of hands-on education (field trips, museums, tours,<br>
hiking, etc.).  The rest of the week, they are often traveling around town with<br>
their mother doing errands.  They spend the first 3-4 hours every morning doing<br>
more traditional homework, then have access to the internet during the afternoon<br>
hours.<br>
