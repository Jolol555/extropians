I have to diverge here.  I find that their are times when my awareness is so<br>
acute that I concentrate very effectively on close to a dozen activities<br>
simultaneously.  There is a kind of 'high' I feel as a new level of coherence<br>
emerges.  Even more remarkably, are the entirely novel and sometimes<br>
pleasurable gestalts of thought in which I gain new insights into previously<br>
intractable problems.  It almost feels as if I'm tapping into some new part<br>
of my brain or making clusters of new neural connections.<br>
<p>
I do agree that there are other times where increased multitasking decreases<br>
my concentration proportionately.  I think this type of<br>
coherence/fragmentation is relevant to the identity vs rapid change thread.<br>
