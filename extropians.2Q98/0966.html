There is a bigger problem with your hypothetical leisure class.  Free<br>
material replication and automation still won't create a leisure class in<br>
any permanent sense.  <br>
<p>
First, there is the problem of energy, which is neither replicable nor<br>
renewable.  Yes, the creation and transport of energy can be automated, but<br>
ambitious individuals could conceivably utilize more energy than could be<br>
transported or generated locally without a mechanism for purchasing<br>
additional energy.  I can easily conceive of situations where the leisure<br>
class would have to get off their collective asses, as it were, to move to<br>
a location that could provide the increasing energy requirements of said<br>
society.  I can't think of a plausible situation where energy would not<br>
have a finite value for these reasons.<br>
<p>
Second, intellectual properties and similar abstractions will likely have<br>
to be purchased as long as people are willing to produce them.  Having the<br>
sole copy of something useful is of great value in a society where<br>
replication is free.  The replication template for a second generation<br>
transmorgifier might very well be worth exclusive access rights to a local<br>
high-density energy source for a society that has free replication and<br>
automation.<br>
