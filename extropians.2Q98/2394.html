<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And?  Doesn't change the partial difference one whit.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: As we add new data to our frame, the<br>
  old data is redefined. If we have 0/6 and<br>
  add 500 other relations not same as 0/6,<br>
  then 0/6 is rare. Add 5000 relations the<br>
  same as 0/6 and 0/6 is common. The use of<br>
  "is" here defines an attribute of identity,<br>
  and the 0/6 identity changes in many ways.<br>
<p>
  What A (partial difference) is, is defined <br>
  by -A, and that defines the whole difference.<br>
  You've simply increased "A" from one-thing to<br>
  one-relation and attempted to make the same <br>
  atomist argument that A is A free from -A<br>
  that your new definition seeks to avoid.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    I assert that your addition of "with respect </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    to 0" is YOUR definition of atomism (consistent</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    with my defintion of holism) and that it is, as </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    you acknowledge, the same as saying "atomism = </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    holism." When I counter atomism I counter the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    traditional definition of atomism that would </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    say that "atomism =/= holism."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ah.  The argument from tradition.  Which tradition of atomists claims that</i><br>
<i>&gt;you can define motion without a reference frame?  (Hint:  "There is none"</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a perfectly valid answer.)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Motion is holistic. Atomism <br>
  is at odds with reality by 100%.<br>
  Atomists tend not to realize that <br>
  in reality, identity is holistic.<br>
<p>
  Observing that the reality atomists<br>
  have been dealing with is holistic<br>
  does not save atomism but voids it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;So, let me get this straight:  The 3 Laws are the right definition, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;therefore my definition is wrong. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: The Three Laws express atomism </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    by 100%. Your definition does not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The right definition expresses atomism by 100%.  The wrong definition does</i><br>
<i>&gt;not.  The above is the logical equivalent of saying "I'm right, and you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong."  In the immortal words of Michael Palin: "This isn't an argument! </i><br>
<i>&gt;It's just contradiction!"</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Nope. There's a difference between saying <br>
  "I'm right and your wrong" and saying WHY. A<br>
  definition of atomism that is 75% holistic is <br>
  wrong *because* it's just not genuine atomism.<br>
  You REdefined atomism into 75% holism and then <br>
  argue that "Atomism is not at odds with reality."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: That idea of independent variance is atomism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   If we take it to the 100% extreme, A is A free from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   any frame of reference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The "with respect to 0" definition allows for "independent variance" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;does not suffer from reductio ad absurdum.  That anything exists without a</i><br>
<i>&gt;frame of reference is a dubious point, and not one which any modern</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomist would support.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: So you say that "atomism = holism" <br>
  and that there is a class of people that <br>
  are atomists, but why are they not holists?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;To wit:  Name a few.  Quote some.  Give an example.</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: That's my point, there's no free thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   An example of a variation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   occurring free from other features in a frame of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   reference is a "free variation" only relative to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   the whole, and does not measure a degree of atomism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, claiming that independent variance within a reference frame is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomism because it is holism is you saying "I'm right and you're wrong." </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: And I guess the possibility that <br>
  your wrong is an inherent contradiction.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    IAN: Then 1 also has no identity because </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    there is no difference between 1 and 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Not unless you're defining your universe with respect to 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     IAN: 1 - 1 = 0, so there is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     no difference between 1 and 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And?</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: You said 0 has no ID because the difference<br>
  between 0 and 0 = 0, I showed that's also true for 1.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: Yes, every point is also a relative </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   0 point, which shows how "A to 0" is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   relation that applies to A/0, B/0 and A/B.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Only one point is a relative 0 within any one reference frame; that's all</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomism asserts.</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: And the sum of all difference <br>
  is 0 in one or all reference frames,<br>
  as the matrix can be just one frame.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   IAN: If A = 3 and B = 6 and A changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   from 3 to 9, A has changed relative </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   to both 0 and B. The relation 0/6 is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   many things from many points of view.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   It is large from 0/.03, it is tiny </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   from 0/103067472. When we include more </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   into our frame of reference we redefine</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   the nature of the 0/6 relation. To say </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   that the 0/6 relation remains static is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   to negate its relation to anything else.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not to negate it, simply not to include it in the definition of identity.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: So relative identity attributes are <br>
  not identity attributes, like "6 is 6 more <br>
  than 0" is not and identity attribute of 6.<br>
