<i>&gt; &gt; From: Dan Fabulich &lt;daniel.fabulich@yale.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; People seem so convinced that anarcho-capitalism will collapse into nation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; states.    There's no checks on the powers of PPAs, except other PPAs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What's to stop them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And I ask you again, what's to stop the US military from doing EXACTLY THE</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; SAME THING?</i><br>
<p>
den Otter wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; The same thing(s) that have stopped them in the past, like the fact that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; soldiers will refuse to kill their own people, including their family and friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.</i><br>
<p>
And why wouldn't this sentimentality be at least as effective in keeping<br>
smaller, commercially competitive forces in check, as it was in keeping<br>
(say) the KGB honest?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; den Otter, your state has a military, yes?  What's going to stop it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; squishing your exquisite statecraft, cutting out the electronic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; surveillance (at least on themselves) and surpressing the masses?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, my system would have a military, but this would not be the only armed</i><br>
<i>&gt; force in the empire. There would have to be several, to provide the necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; balance. ...</i><br>
<p>
But all ultimately under the same command, unlike PPAs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Widespread unemployment takes place because wages don't adjust down, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when the demand for labor falls.  Minimum wage laws are responsible in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; part; labor regulations also play a major role.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We have minimum wage because if you would go much lower people would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; starving.  ...</i><br>
<p>
Who would accept a wage that doesn't pay for the food to supply enough<br>
energy to go to work??<br>
<p>
You can't legislate a living wage.  You can only forbid people to accept<br>
a wage that you think is too low.  How on earth does that benefit them? <br>
How is it better to have NO wages than to be working for less than the<br>
average politician would accept?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Moreover, keep in mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that these very same improvements in technology will also make the goods</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; themselves much cheaper, allowing people to accept lower paying jobs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; still get food on the table.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, automation can make prizes drop, but if stuff gets so cheap you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; sell it for virtually nothing, then why not give it away for free all the same?</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, why not?  The necessities of life may well be given away as<br>
advertising.  But let's not tear down a very functional system (trade)<br>
on the chance that such might happen, hm?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides,  a lot of people would otherwise simply have to beg to get even</i><br>
<i>&gt; those couple of bucks in a highly automated world, because virtually no-one</i><br>
<i>&gt; would want unreliable and inefficient people working for them if they can get</i><br>
<i>&gt; a cheap, trustworthy and super-efficient robot.</i><br>
<p>
Assuming robots can supply ALL services ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Uhm... how do you measure the quality of a psychological profiler?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By the number of screw-ups he makes (how many people that were deemed</i><br>
<i>&gt; "OK" by him turned out to be inadequate ?)</i><br>
<p>
Okay, and who gets to decide which politicians are "inadequate"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And more importantly, why wouldn't the politicians/military add your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; surveilance-bureaucracy-reducing regulations to the round circular file and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; oppress the people as they see fit?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyone who wants can spy back, and expose them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How is this more secure than anarcho-capitalism?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It depends on the "good will" of fewer people.</i><br>
<p>
Oy vey.  If anarcho-capitalism depends on everybody's goodwill, so<br>
what?  If that's a serious flaw then we're in deep trouble, because<br>
DAILY LIFE IN ANY SYSTEM depends on everybody's goodwill to the same<br>
degree.  Every single person in several counties is betting that I (and<br>
the rest of our neighbors) won't steal a car tonight and go burn their<br>
house down.<br>
<p>
Where power is dispersed, no one person is much of a threat, and there<br>
are balances to every plausible threat.  Where power is concentrated,<br>
the opposite is true.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, sometimes good products are suppressed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;because they threaten the position of some big powerful company</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;that happens to operate in the same niche. Only a powerful state</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;can put these things right, thus achieving a higher level of progress</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;and product quality for the consumer to enjoy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I challenge you to provide even one example of such "market failures" which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; was not CAUSED by a powerful state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You mean caused by corruption and such, the backing of malafide companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; in return for bribes? This problem would be greatly reduced by strict surveillance.</i><br>
<p>
Or by taking power away from the politicians; private parties, spending<br>
their own money, have no reason to take bribes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, putting techophiles in office (at least at positions where it counts) should</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent the "disappearance" (into the vaults of some company or the gov itself)</i><br>
<i>&gt; of breaktrough inventions.</i><br>
<p>
You mean like the miracle carburetor, or the pill that turns water into<br>
gasoline?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When I "vote" in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; always win.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Unless you buy crap of course.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You think it's crap; but if I like it, then I win.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure, but if you like it, it probably wasn't crap in the first place. I meant</i><br>
<i>&gt; *real* crap, like food so full of conservatives that you'll develop cancer</i><br>
<i>&gt; over time, or a television set with lousy sound etc.</i><br>
<p>
There are civil remedies for such things.  Political control over the<br>
market cannot prevent them; it can only ensure that they happen more<br>
often.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm quite sure your PPAs would either</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;be a minority from the start (the rest being totalitarian clans, citystates and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;full- blown countries)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not if it takes place through a slow period of privitization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think an initially smooth transition gaurantees anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At a certain point a lot of governments and dictators and who knows</i><br>
<i>&gt; what else will see the power they had for so long slip through their</i><br>
<i>&gt; fingers. I'll be damned if not at least some of them would opt for</i><br>
<i>&gt; very desperate measures to turn the tide...</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, the transition is a delicate period.  Best to disarm the<br>
politicians NOW so they won't be tempted.  ;)<br>
<p>
But I'll take a risky transition to anarchy in preference to the nice<br>
orderly march toward slavery that we're on now.<br>
<p>
What if we buy off the politicians?  Tell them:  "You deserve to be<br>
taken out and shot, but that's a lot of trouble, so instead we're going<br>
to give you all the gold you can carry, and a one-way ticket to any<br>
other continent."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;or that many, possibly all, would quickly degenerate into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;flock of hardworking, meek/scared sheep ruled by an elite of enforcers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Maybe, if they like it like that ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They may not really like it, but looking through history that appears to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; the way things sooner or later turn out.</i><br>
<p>
And one could equally well say, looking through history, that sooner or<br>
later people get richer and more free.  Every cycle has a top and a<br>
bottom.  All we can hope for, I suppose, is to make the top come sooner<br>
and last longer.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You misunderstand how PPAs would work.  PPAs wouldn't have their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; regions exclusively; their regions would overlap with many other available</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; PPAs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Initially, maybe. But enforcement groups of any kind are traditionally very</i><br>
<i>&gt; territorial (like gangs, who have their own city blocks) and I see no reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; why PPAs would be any different. If you want to offer solid security to</i><br>
<i>&gt; your customers, than you must be in firm control of the place they live</i><br>
<i>&gt; in.</i><br>
<p>
Around here, I often see stickers on shop windows saying "protected by<br>
XYZ Security" - some private firm which, when it hears an alarm, sends a<br>
couple of goons.  And it's not the same firm whose sticker is on the<br>
shop next door.  It helps if such firms are friendly with each other,<br>
but they obviously needn't have all the business in town.  If pizza<br>
delivery is competitive, why not police delivery?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;You wouldn't even have to leave your house to switch PPAs, just pick</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; up a telephone and make a deal.  Sure, perhaps your current PPA could try</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to stop you... but so could the US military.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The US military don't give a damn about such stuff. And if you want to leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; the US, that's *fine*. It's getting in that's the problem (well, theoretically</i><br>
<i>&gt; then).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Like I said, your military has a pretty good track record when it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; (attempted) coups.</i><br>
<p>
Why would they suddenly become less ethical if they shared the business<br>
with other firms?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; So could the military in your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; own imagined government.  What's stopping them?  How is this more secure</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than a competitive system?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Greater size usually means greater stability. To give an example, streetgangs</i><br>
<i>&gt; fight all the time, while big governments only fight sporadically, and since the</i><br>
<i>&gt; advent of nukes the major ones even don't fight at all.</i><br>
<p>
How silly of the Afghans not to recognize the advantages of size and<br>
stability.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, their conscience (that of the regular soldier) is stopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; them from turning on their own people.</i><br>
<p>
Do people lose their conscience when they work in the private sector?<br>
<p>
A few years ago, Marines at Twentynine Palms (don't ask me why "marines"<br>
have a base in the Mojave Desert) were given a notorious questionnaire<br>
about their willingness to fire on Americans to enforce some chickenshit<br>
law.  About one in three (iirc) said yes.  They're the ones who will be<br>
chosen as "reliable" when the shit hits the fan.<br>
<p>
A few months ago, a boy about 17 was herding goats one evening on the<br>
Rio Grande (border with Mexico), and shot at something.  We'll never<br>
know why he fired (rabbit? coyote?), because four Marines sneaking about<br>
- looking for drug smugglers - assumed he was firing at them, stalked<br>
him for twenty minutes (during which he apparently was oblivious to<br>
them) and killed him.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In my system you could add to that mutual surveillance (the people</i><br>
<i>&gt; spy back, and, for what it's worth, they have guns).</i><br>
<p>
And what do they use their guns for?  Clearly not to discipline corrupt<br>
politicians; that would be anarchy!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a more advanced stage of automation the key to avoid tirrany</i><br>
<i>&gt; is spreading control over the enforcer robots over rivalizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; institutions (that are unlike PPs part of the same system, more</i><br>
<i>&gt; like different immune systems in one body than seperate bodies).</i><br>
<p>
Could you tell us more about how these rival institutions are not like<br>
private protection agencies?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex, providing mediocre yet somehow</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;"appealing" services and taking out competition left and right by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;any means necessary. Such a PPA would become more like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;a nation state with every takeover or alliance it achieved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So what?  The US military has the means and the incentives to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exactly that; they wouldn't even have to be slow about it, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there is no competing military in the US to stop them.  So why is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this so much more secure than anarcho-capitalism?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because this system has proven itself, and anarcho-capitalism has</i><br>
<i>&gt; (to my knowledge) yet to give a working example.</i><br>
<p>
Something like it is common in "primitive" societies; indeed the<br>
definition of "primitive society" seems to be "stateless society".<br>
<p>
Iceland relied entirely on private enforcement for centuries, and was<br>
generally peaceful.  (The sagas, which concentrate on violence, tell of<br>
years going by between events in the bitterest feuds.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If it is so great or natural, then why don't we see it all over?</i><br>
<p>
Partly because until recently you had to be very rich to own useful<br>
weapons.  In the Middle Ages, of course, the dominant weapon of war was<br>
the armored horseman: no peasant could hope to stand up to him.  Thus<br>
power was centralized.<br>
<p>
Now, every peasant can afford a weapon that would make short work of a<br>
medieval knight, and weapons that can kill tanks and helicopters are<br>
within the reach (fiscal if not legal) of most of us.  If the world<br>
continues to bow down to central authorities, it's partly out of habit.<br>
<p>
Where the central authorities are relatively benign, they will probably<br>
last longer; where they are recognized openly as tyrants and thieves,<br>
they will soon be gone, as already in Northern Somaliland.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;PPAs and other anarcho-capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;goodies may be great in *theory*, but are in fact ivory tower</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;productions that don't take human nature into account and will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;thus fail as have many before them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'd say the idea that you could check the power of the military simply by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; designing a new system of laws is the ivory tower production.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Apparently the system is doing fine even without hew laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I sure don't see any coup d'etats in the USA...</i><br>
<p>
Then you haven't heard about how the politicians have taken to wiping<br>
their backsides with the Bill of Rights?  We don't need coups d'etat, we<br>
have tyranny coming in the front door in the name of "national security"<br>
and "protecting our children" and "preventing terrorism" and all that<br>
baloney.<br>
<p>
(Last week I was required to show my state-issued portrait before using<br>
an air ticket.  What in the name of little green apples is this supposed<br>
to accomplish?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And yes, a system of checks and balances could reduce any such risk</i><br>
<i>&gt; even further (in fact, that's pretty much what you have with all your</i><br>
<i>&gt; special branches, secret services, police forces etc.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to work OK.</i><br>
<p>
Except for its victims.<br>
