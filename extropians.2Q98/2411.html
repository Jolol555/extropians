Yes, but the sense of community is rather weak, imo, certainly not<br>
comparable to that of a religious or political group. A shame, from a<br>
practical poit of view.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In another direction, most religions split into two components. One builds</i><br>
<i>&gt; churches, institutions, rules and dogma. The other stays close to creating</i><br>
<i>&gt; altered states for all of the members. Examples are Native American Church</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Santa Diamo - with peyote and ayhuasca being the respective agents</i><br>
<i>&gt; used for ASCs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems that positive ASCs are an integral aspect of the healing dimensions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of religion, shamanism, and possible worth serious consideration for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhuman and extropian communities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Shall I say, "Best be High when you Do It So...."</i><br>
<p>
It would certainly be a good idea to have more transhuman parties with<br>
lots of good food, music and drugs. It's great fun, and effectively<br>
increases the sense of community (which is rather important for a<br>
developing movement). <br>
 <br>
Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Which of course suggests that we should seriously think about how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;get the benefits from religion without the drawbacks. Most likely any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;form of comittment that provides a sense of belonging, a positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;livable universe where temporary setbacks are just temproary (despite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their severity) would have the same benefits. Can transhumanism become</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a "religion" in this sense, providing the health benefits? </i><br>
<p>
It certainly has all the elements to become the first truly rational<br>
religion: life after death(cryonics), transcension(uploading), eternal<br>
bliss(paradise engineering), sin &amp; evil (entropy, deathism, statism<br>
etc), armageddon (singularity), ethics (rational ethics of enlightened<br>
self-interst), art (extropic/transhuman art) and so on. Add to this <br>
certain socio-political views (like pro-choice, pro legalization of<br>
drugs and other victimless crimes, tough on real crime, firm atheism<br>
etc.) and you have a "perfect package", a complete marketable worldview<br>
that can challenge the existing philosophies at every point. Vacuum<br>
control, so to speak.<br>
