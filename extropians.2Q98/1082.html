<p>
The question isn't exactly lame, although it might be posed in the<br>
wrong way. Who determines today who gets to access the Internet? There<br>
is no central control of this in most countries (Cuba the only<br>
exception I know of). Some people have complained that the poor have<br>
no access, but even that is rapidly changing since access is getting<br>
cheaper and cheaper, both in the west and in the third world (I saw a<br>
plot of Internet growth rates in Africa, truly impressive - they still<br>
have a long way to go, but are catching up admirably). Educated people<br>
were first onto the net, but now less educated people are also catchin<br>
up. As are the elderly, and so on.<br>
<p>
Compare this to the spread of transhuman technologies. It is unlikely<br>
that there will ever be a Departement of Transhuman Development in any<br>
nation, since the developments are likely to be fast, widespread and<br>
divergent. At the start, the only people who will benefit from the<br>
technologies will be test subjects and true neophiles. Then the rich,<br>
ambitious and well educated will start to use them. Gradually, as the<br>
technology gets more refined and cheaper it will spread, and in the<br>
long run it will be used by virtually everybody. This is just like the<br>
spread of telephones; once they were just experimental, then they were<br>
for the rich, later they gradually diffused out into society and<br>
became part of everyday life (there are some amusing stories about how<br>
some people wanted to limit their spread since they feared the poor<br>
would call the rich!). <br>
<p>
The question is of course if the fast growth of transhumanizing<br>
technologies would create an ever widening gulf between the adapters<br>
and the non-adapters. Furtunately it seems that the diffusion of<br>
technology is also speeding up - it took the telephone several decades<br>
to become ubiquitious, while the cellular phone has become quite<br>
common in just a few years. (see<br>
<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Masevr/6001170a.gif">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Masevr/6001170a.gif</a> for a picture) Most<br>
likely there will not be any real gulf between the haves or have nots<br>
unless other factors create it.<br>
