<i>&gt; From:          "Sean kenny" &lt;skenny@gifford.co.uk&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure this is so. The reason the state has historically taken</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibilty</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the education of the vast majority of its population is because</i><br>
<i>&gt; Governemnts</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognised that a growing Capitalist economy had to be able to access a</i><br>
<i>&gt; much</i><br>
<i>&gt; larger pool of educated and skilled labour than the previously ruling and</i><br>
<i>&gt; upper </i><br>
<i>&gt; middle class education systems were able or willing to provide beyond a few</i><br>
<p>
In the United States, in the first case where compulsory-education <br>
laws were imposed (Boston, just before the Civil War), they caused <br>
riots.  Parents objected because the approved schools were so much <br>
worse than the schools they were already sending their kids to.<br>
<p>
In fact, Boston (just before the Civil War) was achieving a higher <br>
degree of literacy among black 14-year-olds *without* <br>
compulsory-education laws than it now achieves among all <br>
18-year-olds *with* compulsory-education laws.<br>
<p>
Yes, Boston at that time *did* have some schools that received tax <br>
funding.  They enrolled about 1/3 of all white students and 1/4 of <br>
all black students.<br>
<p>
In the US generally, the imposition of compulsory-education laws and <br>
the creation of a general system of tax-funded schools appears to <br>
have increased total school enrollment by about 1%.  The evidence <br>
suggests that of this 1%, about half were kids who had been running <br>
the till in their family's business, but were sent to school to learn <br>
to add (yes, I'm serious -- I personally ran a second-hand shop for <br>
on my own for as much as an hour at a time while my parents attended <br>
to other aspects of the business, prior to entering first grade, so <br>
I know it does happen); or could no longer go on international <br>
journeys with their parents, because they had to go to school and <br>
study geography.  The other half were taken away from jobs that their <br>
family relied on to assist in providing a decent standard of living.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; scholarships. Market oriented Education systems seem to quickly degenerate</i><br>
<i>&gt; into</i><br>
<i>&gt; elitist education for the wealthy and no education at all for the poorest,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brazil for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example.</i><br>
<p>
One cannot expect a mass good such as education to truly achieve a <br>
mass market, when the government's general economic policy is so <br>
extremely mercantilist (anti-free-market thinly disguised as <br>
capitalist) that the masses can barely afford food.<br>
