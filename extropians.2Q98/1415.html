<i>&gt; &gt; The number of completely groundless assumptions in this analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are too many to count.  First, the idea that the author only makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; money from sales of his book is idiotic.  He is much more valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than that; he can sell his presence, his expertise, his skill,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the consumer attention of his name, /and/ his labor in a thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other ways that authors today don't take advantage of because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their publishers are too lazy and unimaginative to see them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I defy you to name ONE such way that is not already in use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But some people who write books, DON'T want to become TV stars.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean: most programmers<br>
don't want to do QA or tech support, but most of us have paid<br>
our dues there because there's money in it.  Making a living<br>
is about doing what /other/ people want.  I couldn't give a<br>
damn how an author wants to make money; if ey wants mine, ey'd<br>
better do what /I/ want em to do.  I don't support abolition<br>
of copyright because it will make authors happy--though it<br>
will, in the long run, make them richer along with everyone<br>
else--I support it because it is morally right.<br>
<p>
Things authors generally don't do now: charge real money for<br>
autographs and appearances (usually they just tour to support<br>
book sales), host online forums for buyers of their books,<br>
sell advertising space in their books, rework stories from<br>
other books or other media in their own style, offer buyers<br>
of authorized editions special access to future works or<br>
other works of the same publisher.  I'm sure there are more.<br>
A few are probably done to some small degree already, but<br>
generally they are not done because pubishers can more<br>
easily exploit the current system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And, by eliminating intellectual property, you eliminate many of </i><br>
<i>&gt; these ways...</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  And your point is?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Because many of them are based on identity as the </i><br>
<i>&gt; author, but the author has no more legal claim to that identity than </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone else.  There would be nothing in law to stop you from taking a </i><br>
<i>&gt; pseudonym that happens to be the name on the cover of a book written </i><br>
<i>&gt; by someone else, and going around giving speeches as if you had </i><br>
<i>&gt; written it.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but there is--I've said nothing about abolishing laws against<br>
willful fraud, and that is a willful fraud prosecutable by any<br>
civil court.  Trademarks are not intellectual property in the<br>
same way that copyrights and patents are, because they only exist<br>
by use, and are only enforcible against those who act deliberately<br>
to deceive the public about their identity.  This, I wholeheartedly<br>
agree, is a crime.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with copyright<br>
or patent law.  (Our current government lumps them together into<br>
the US Patent and Trademark Office--that no more implies that<br>
they are the same thing than does the fact that they lump together<br>
alcohol, tobacco, and firearms).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Those items -- that the first publisher pays but the second publisher </i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't -- typically cost more than printing and binding the first </i><br>
<i>&gt; print run, which is paid by both the first publisher and the second </i><br>
<i>&gt; publisher.</i><br>
<p>
In today's system, yes.  Obviously, without copyright, it would be<br>
stupid for publishers to keep doing things that way.  They would<br>
look for more ways to exploit the non-copyable things: the authors'<br>
time and talents, good name, market share, consumer attention, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; they want information customized to their needs.  The author is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the best position to do that, even after initial publication.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please explain how this applies to a typical romance novel.</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't.  In a world without copyright, the typical romance<br>
novel would probably be published by the same folks who today<br>
print uncopyrighted works like Shakespeare collections and Bibles.<br>
Without copyright, Barbara Cartland would have to find a new job.<br>
I can't say that distresses me much.  Maybe she could do live<br>
readings, or equivalently, just run $4/minute 900 number more<br>
suited to her talents.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some of us don't think a man's labor is worthless simply because the </i><br>
<i>&gt; essence of his production is non-material.</i><br>
<p>
Nor do I.  But nor do I think one man's labor is worth more than<br>
another's just /because/ it is intellectual rather than physical.<br>
I have not one whit more respect for a good writer than for a<br>
good carpenter, yet the former has a monopoly frocibly maintained<br>
for him by the government and the latter does not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We will agree to eliminating the protection of intellectual property </i><br>
<i>&gt; the same day we agree to eliminating the protection of physical </i><br>
<i>&gt; property -- including the laws against murder.</i><br>
<p>
If you can't see the difference, you're not even trying.  If you<br>
take my life, I lose it.  If you take my money, I lose it.  If you<br>
take my ideas, I still have them.  That is a difference in objective<br>
reality, and any law that treats objectively different things as if<br>
they were the same is a bad law.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why, then, do nations with meaningful copyright laws have MORE </i><br>
<i>&gt; creativity and artistry than nations without -- and the artists </i><br>
<i>&gt; better rewarded?</i><br>
<p>
For one, I see no evidence of that correlation; two, even if there<br>
is a 100% correlation, that does not tell you which is cause and<br>
which the effect.  I suspect nations with lots of good artists<br>
have a larger political lobby to fight for favors.  All special<br>
interest groups lobby for handouts; that's the nature of politics.<br>
I don't want to subsidize Gallo wines or Archer Daniels Midland,<br>
nor do I want to subsidize Dave Barry.  The fact that some people<br>
see the latter as normal is of no consequence to me.<br>
