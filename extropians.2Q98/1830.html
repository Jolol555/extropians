Abstract<br>
  The authors studied distributions of body weight for<br>
  height, change in body weight with age, and<br>
  the relationship between body mass index and<br>
  mortality among participants in the Epidemiologic Follow-up<br>
  Study of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHEFS)<br>
  (n = 14,407), a cohort study based on an representative sample of the U.S.<br>
  population. Percentiles of body weight for<br>
  height according to age and sex are presented.<br>
  Cross-sectional analyses of body weight suggest that mean<br>
  body weight increases with age until late middle age, then<br>
  plateaus and decreases for older aged persons. However, longitudinal analysis<br>
  of change in weight with age shows that younger persons in the lower quintile<br>
  at baseline tend to gain more than those in the higher quintile. Older<br>
  persons in the higher quintile at baseline have the greatest average loss in<br>
  weight. The relationship of body mass index to<br>
  mortality is a U-shaped curve, with increased risks in the<br>
  lowest and highest 15% of the distribution. Increased risk of<br>
  mortality associated with the highest 15th percentile of the<br>
  body mass index distribution, as well as the highest 15% of<br>
  the joint distribution of body mass index and skinfold<br>
  thickness, is statistically significant for white women. However, the risk<br>
  diminishes when adjusted for the presence of disease and factors related to<br>
  disease. More noteworthy is the fact that there is a statistically<br>
  significant excess risk of mortality for both race and sex<br>
  groups in the lowest 15% of the body mass index distribution<br>
  after adjusting for smoking history, and presence of disease. Those in the<br>
  lowest 15% of the joint body mass index and skinfold<br>
  thickness distribution, were also at increased risk. Risk of<br>
  mortality for both men and women who have lost 10% or more<br>
  of their maximum lifetime weight within the last 10 years is statistically<br>
  significant, even when controlling for current weight. This study has<br>
  replicated previously reported relationships, while correcting for several<br>
  methodological issues.<br>
