<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    You seem to be under the impression that your </i><br>
<i>&gt;    scenario has violated the symmetry of measure,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    that A measures "smaller" free from reference </i><br>
<i>&gt;    to something "larger" than the smaller. There </i><br>

<i>&gt;    ments, that's 8 measurements in all, but your </i><br>
<i>&gt;    chart only includes half of them, as you say:</i><br>
<p>
No, there is smaller, and there is larger.  However, there is no POSITIVE<br>
in this example.  That's the difference.  The larger, in this case, is<br>
zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;So, here are ALL of the measurements you have available to you:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A measuring A: 0</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A measuring B: - (never +, uses A's ruler!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;B measuring B: 0</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;B measuring A: -</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: That's half, here are all measurments:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   After B passed by A near the speed of light,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A filled out this chart of all differences:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;              A  B</i><br>
<i>&gt;             ______</i><br>
<i>&gt;          A | 0 -1 |</i><br>
<i>&gt;            |      |</i><br>
<i>&gt;          B | 1  0 |</i><br>
<i>&gt;            --------</i><br>
<p>
Funny how this chart is different from the others you've provided before,<br>
yet you claim to be repeating yourself.  &lt;sigh&gt; I guess that's to be<br>
expected. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   (AA) Difference between A and A = 0</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (AB) Difference between A and B = A is  1 larger</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (BA) Difference between B and A = B is -1 smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (BB) Difference between B and B = 0</i><br>
<p>
Unless you're defining relativity differently from the way I am (which<br>
wouldn't surprise me one bit), you can't have A find AB, and CERTAINLY not<br>
BB.  AB is not a measurement which A can make: it can only make BA and<br>
infer that AB must be its negative.  Similarly, it could infer that BB<br>
would be 0, but no measurement which A can make will show this.<br>
<p>
How can I say this?  Well, think about how A is making a measurement: it<br>
takes itself, which is zero, and it compares itself against others.  A can<br>
observe these differences.  But could A measure A from B's perspective<br>
this way?  No.  Indeed, if A tried to use B's actual perspective, you'd<br>
get my non-zero chart.  Instead, A must infer that if A perceives B to be<br>
smaller and A to be larger, B must perceive the same thing.  This<br>
inference is valid in Newtonian mechanics, but as we can see in this case<br>
it is not: B has a different bottom row than A would infer.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, in this case B does NOT perceive the same thing: it<br>
perceives the exact opposite of what it should.  Rather than observing AB<br>
to be 1, B observes AB to be -1.  So the bottom row, which describes what<br>
B perceives, is invalid as a description; it describes what A thinks that<br>
B ought to see, what A infers B *must* see.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Observer B measured these differences:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;              A  B</i><br>
<i>&gt;             ______</i><br>
<i>&gt;          A | 0  1 |</i><br>
<i>&gt;            |      |</i><br>
<i>&gt;          B |-1  0 |</i><br>
<i>&gt;            --------</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   (AA) Difference between A and A = 0</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (AB) Difference between A and B = A is -1 smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (BA) Difference between B and A = B is  1 larger</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (BB) Difference between B and B = 0</i><br>
<p>
Similarly, B cannot measure AA or BA.  It cannot say what A would<br>
perceive, but can only infer it based on what B perceives.  (And indeed,<br>
if B tried to use this chart to predict what A perceives, B would be flat<br>
out wrong.)<br>
<p>
Now, if you want to say that we're just taking the differences measured as<br>
well as the differences inferred and summing those, you can, but it's<br>
somewhat of a hack.  As you can see, you can no longer explain reality in<br>
terms of an identity chart.  It suddenly takes two charts, which isn't at<br>
all what your theory would claim.  Indeed, just below you quote your "one<br>
chart" theory, despite the fact that it now takes two.  It also has to<br>
take inferred perceptions into account, which IMO greatly weakens the<br>
theory, though not quite as much as the fact that one identity chart is<br>
insufficient to describe reality.<br>
