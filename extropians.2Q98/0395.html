<i>&gt;anything in stocks for a few years, you can do quite well.  My older</i><br>
<i>&gt;brother, for instance, dropped out of college with nothing but a bad back</i><br>
<i>&gt;and a lawn mower. Now he owns one of the largest property management and</i><br>
<i>&gt;landscaping firms in New Hampshire. He was offered a goodly fraction of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;million for his business this year (ten years since he started it with</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing). He also does quite well in the stock market.  He has never been</i><br>
<i>&gt;given any support from anyone, no outside investors, and always pays 'cash</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the barrelhead'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The biggest factors in 'getting rich' are:<br>
<p>
1. Make your own luck - get out there and hustle for your business.<br>
2. Never take a loan if you can avoid it. Paying interest sucks the<br>
lifeblood out of a business.<br>
3. Be willing to live like a streetperson while pouring all your cash back<br>
into the business.<br>
4. Ignore all advice from the Wall Street Journal and MBA's, economics<br>
professors on tenure, etc.<br>
<p>
My business has been handicapped by raising a family, so I have not been<br>
able to fully implement points 2 and 3 above. I have been working for five<br>
years now, and am starting to see the end of my debt, and rising profits.<br>
Unfortunately, this corresponds with sending three kids to college.<br>
<p>
In short, if you are prepared to work long and hard (and smart!), you will<br>
probably succeed. If not the first time, surely the second or third...<br>
<p>
I have seen successful businesses reduced to chaos by managers that<br>
slavishly followed the WSJ and any convenient corporate holy grail such as<br>
'quality', 'downsizing' or 'just in time' wihtout understanding the basic<br>
premises behind these concepts which have valid application in SOME businesses.<br>
