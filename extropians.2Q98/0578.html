<i>&gt; </i><br>
If the reponse time of the region is long enough (doubtful), you<br>
could perhaps physically swing a single dipole around the head.<br>
as I recall, an appropriate dipole would generate a cylinder of<br>
approximately uniform flux along its axis between the poles,<br>
witb the "return path" for the flux approximateing a a much larger<br>
(and therefore less dense) sphere. If this approximation is<br>
valid, thenswinging the entire mess around so that the opposite<br>
poles describe a sphere about the target region will concentrate<br>
the average flux at the target. This is the apporach that was (is?)<br>
used in radiation treatments of cancer. the problems to solve are:<br>
1) the diameter of the hi-flux cylinder is probably large by comparison<br>
to the equivalent beam used in radiation therapy, and<br>
2) the time constant for reaction to the magnetic field is likely<br>
to be short (milliseconds?) relative to the time constant for<br>
sensitivity to radiation (minutes to days.) You may be able to<br>
solve the second problem by moving the field from magnet to magnet<br>
electronically rather than by moving it physically, but as Anders<br>
says, this could be tricky.<br>
