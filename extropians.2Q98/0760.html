 JKC&gt; The basic idea has merit, I always thought the huge star ship<br>
 JKC&gt; Enterprise was dumb because there is no point in hauling millions<br>
 JKC&gt; of tons of matter around the galaxy when you can send the really<br>
 JKC&gt; important part, information, much easier.<br>
<p>
Well, Star Trek was created a long time ago.  And besides, TV shows are<br>
created for a mass audience.  Their concepts usually lag years behind the SF<br>
literature.<br>
<p>
But yeah, if you take the laws of physics as we currently understand them, and<br>
you work out the most efficient way to cross interstellar distances, this is<br>
what you come up with.  At least, I haven't heard any better ideas yet.<br>
<p>
 JKC&gt; The seeds would be very small and if it's a Von Neumann self<br>
 JKC&gt; replicateor you'd only need to make one.<br>
<p>
I read a short story in which Earth was bombarded with such seeds.  They were<br>
microscopic, so they didn't have to really be aimed or guided.  Instead the<br>
aliens manufactured zillions of them and "sprayed" them toward our solar<br>
system with some kind of accelerator.  The idea being that if you launch<br>
enough of them, there's a good chance one will land someplace viable where it<br>
can grow.  It's an interesting idea, but I don't know how practical it would<br>
be.<br>
<p>
 JKC&gt; Even if they moved no faster than existing space probes (a very<br>
 JKC&gt; unlikely possibility) there would be several in every star system in<br>
 JKC&gt; the galaxy in just an instant of time, less than 50 million years. I<br>
 JKC&gt; don't see any such probes in our galaxy and that's one reason I think<br>
 JKC&gt; ET's are unlikely.<br>
<p>
50 million years?  That may be an "instant" in the cosmic scheme of things,<br>
but I hope we can do much better!  I once read an estimate that the whole<br>
galaxy could be colonized in about 200,000 years using starships.<br>
<p>
As for ETs being unlikely -- I tend to agree with your reasoning, but I would<br>
prefer not to make a judgement on such skimpy information.  There's a lot we<br>
still don't know.<br>
<p>
 JKC&gt; However, before any of this happens we will have achieved immortality<br>
 JKC&gt; and mastered Nanotechnology, uploading and artificial intelligence, and<br>
 JKC&gt; it will be a radically different world. I don't think an organization to<br>
 JKC&gt; promote this idea could do much good, by the time it happens any ideas<br>
 JKC&gt; we have now on the subject won't be of any use, it would be like Pikaia,<br>
 JKC&gt; the first animal with a spinal cord that lived 570 million years ago<br>
 JKC&gt; worrying about the year 2000 computer bug.<br>
<p>
Hm...  I dunno.  I'll have to think about that.  I do think the problems<br>
related to the operation of the network itself should be straightforward.<br>
<p>
Here's something else...  The coming times will be marked with upheaval and<br>
chaos.  Already it seems like few people care about achieving greatness.  Too<br>
many want only safety, security, and lots of toys.  It might be nice for<br>
people to have some larger goal in the future to look forward to.<br>
