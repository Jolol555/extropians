By this, I presume you meant that a couple of hundred people think <br>
"rationally" all the time? Leaving aside the difficulty in defining <br>
"rational" in the present context [1], I doubt that there has ever been a <br>
human being anywhere who was always rational. If you meant it in the more <br>
restricted sense of with respect to this issue, then you are wrong by <br>
many orders af magnitude. Based upon the best information known to <br>
them (which is usually very poor), the rational opinion for most people <br>
to have on this subject is either "I don't know whether immortality would <br>
be a good thing", or "I'd like it, but I don't think it's very likely". <br>
These are both opinions which I've heard expressed or implied quite often <br>
by a wide variety of people.<br>
<p>
On a more general note, I have often been intrigued when reading the <br>
biographies of creative people to note the existence of huge blind spots <br>
in their thinking.  I wonder if this may not be more of an advantage <br>
to their creative abilities than a disadvantage. Profound knowledge <br>
combined with profound ignorance seems to be quite common amongst the <br>
most creative scientists. James Watson's "The Double Helix" is a good <br>
example. <br>
<p>
[1] It is quite possible to construct a value system which implies <br>
that immortality is a bad idea. If Hayflick's value system is of this <br>
type, then his conclusion is quite rational, although his stated <br>
reasoning is not.<br>
