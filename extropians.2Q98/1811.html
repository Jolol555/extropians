<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; They involve setting up video cameras in the homes of pet owners to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; record animals' activities while their owners are away. Then they ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; owners to return home at unpredictable times -- by taxi and not their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; own car. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;... I know that a study I did read about showed that most of this dog </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;'psychic' behavior was them hearing the sound of their owners vehicles </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;at a far greater distance than previously thought capable. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: The article quoted above noted that a taxi was</i><br>
<i>&gt;   used to eliminate the possibily of auditory clues</i><br>
<i>&gt;   causes by a dog's familiarity with its owners car.</i><br>

<i>&gt;   I can see it now PSYCHIC DOG NETWORKS! "Don't be fooled</i><br>
<i>&gt;   by other psychic-dog services, only PDN uses real psychic</i><br>
<i>&gt;   dogs, yes that's right REAL psychic dogs! Call now for your</i><br>
<i>&gt;   free 2 minute consultation. Just ask Rover anything and he'll</i><br>
<i>&gt;   give you the answer, the answer YOUR looking for. 2 barks means</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "yes" and 1 bark means "no." What have you got to loose? Call NOW!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   1-900-RUF-RUFF"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   This could really cut the overhead for those psychic "services"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   since they could just have tape recorders attached to the phones</i><br>
<i>&gt;   programmed to select either a 1 or 2 bark recording after the </i><br>
<i>&gt;   caller's voices pauses for a few seconds, indicating that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   question was just asked and the caller is waiting for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;   reply. A slight delay would even induce the impression </i><br>
<i>&gt;   that the dog was accessing the "inner-psychic channels."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Personally, I think that those psychic networks skirt or</i><br>
<i>&gt;   totally breach the standard of fraud, but enforcing such</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a case against them would be so difficult since the nature</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of the "product" they "supply" is so intangible. I think </i><br>
<i>&gt;   it simply comes  down to, the dumb will just be ripped off.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Playing slot machines is even smarter than calling "psychics."</i><br>

---   I do belive  there are psychics  in the world but not  of the  <br>
nature  of  he ones  on  the  phone lines.   I myself have  dreamed  <br>
thing  that  did  come  true most often  in  the same context of  my <br>
dream.  But the thing  I am most skeptical about  in  the predicting  <br>
on a whim.  Maybe  if you where  sitting  at a  government  computer  <br>
you could  be  seen  as predicting, but  it  is not something that <br>
humans  can  accomplish.<br>
