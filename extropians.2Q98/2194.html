Sarah Marr wrote 6/4/98: &lt;First, are these lists to retain the exclusivity<br>
which might serve ExI best in the long run, by establishing its credentials<br>
as a world-class organization, or are they to be open to all, hence<br>
increasing publicity, but, more than likely, deterring the specifically<br>
scientific/economic professional community from using the nodes as a<br>
'trading' place?&gt;<br>
<p>
When lists such as these are open to individuals who are aiming at truth,<br>
they do well.  When they are open to individuals who are aiming at power,<br>
they stink.  Credentialism per se is a destructive force because ideas are<br>
rejected for vanity and not logic.  The signal-to-noise ratio in nature is<br>
minute, only what grabs our attention at the moment produces signals, and<br>
the s/n ratio on the lists is completely dependent on contributors' flights<br>
of fancy.  The s/n cannot be managed any more than an economy can be<br>
planned.  Only obvious relativists/compostmodernists need be booted from<br>
contributing as being incapable of seriousness or coherency.<br>
<p>
&lt;Second, with multiple, highly-specific nodes, how is ExI to ensure that<br>
'cross-pollenation' of ideas occurs effectively?&gt;<br>
<p>
They must all be in the same garden, the ExI agora, if you will.  I can't<br>
express how important it is to discuss esoteric ideas in the vernacular,<br>
and resist the temptation to use specialist language.  So often, I find<br>
that very disparate disciplines are really discussing the same objective<br>
phenomena, only you have to wade through specialist sludge interminably<br>
before you find the commonalities.<br>
<p>
&lt;Put another way, is ExI a network for the discussion of popularized,<br>
though sometimes innovative ideas, open to all, or is it to be a community<br>
of multi-disciplinary thinkers, with a proven track-record of academic and<br>
commercial success?&gt;<br>
<p>
'Academic success' is an oxymoron.  :)<br>
<p>
Only money counts, ask anyone, even the ivory-tower herd.  ExI obviously<br>
has a single, solitary mission, namely, to increase extropy.  The lists<br>
should keep this in mind, fostering exropic ideas, both through innovation<br>
and propagation, and critiquing entropic ideas that lead either to nihilism<br>
or dogmatism.  Offense and defense, always with an eye on the goal, the<br>
competitors and the time-clock.  If you sit around filtering out everyone<br>
without proven track-records and credentials, you have cut off the<br>
creators, the visionaries, and the innovators.  You slide into smugness.<br>
<p>
&lt;One final way of considering this question: what form of organization does<br>
ExI need to be in order to create the future, rather than merely comment on<br>
it?&gt;<br>
<p>
It needs a whole boat-load of money.  Money, money, money and more money to<br>
have direct or brute power.  Lacking gobs of money, commenting<br>
intelligently exerts quite substantial indirect or influential power.<br>
