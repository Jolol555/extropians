Same here.<br>

<i>&gt;his web page.  I read criticisms by a power engineer of Yourdon's</i><br>
<i>&gt;fearmongering about electricity disruption.  The bulletin board</i><br>

Hal:  I'd love it if you (or anyone else) could provide some good links for<br>
Y2K  skepticism (if I can call it that). It's really easy to find stuff by<br>
the fear-mongerers, and it is useful to look over what they have to say. But<br>
I've had more difficulty tracking down contrary reasoning (saying why we<br>
shouldn't be too fearful) with anything like the detail found on North's or<br>
Yourdon's sites.<br>
<p>
Thanks for any pointers,<br>
