Yak, I fear that you are about to be blasted for heresy. Many of our<br>
fellow participants seem to spend a great deal of time complaining<br>
about how bad thing are. I personally agree with you that the current<br>
system in the U.S. and in the world as a whole is better than it has<br>
ever been  and is steadily improving in most ways. It's<br>
still far from perfect, and I even agree that some of the problems<br>
addressed by our fellows are real and need attention. However,<br>
the current system is IMO very likely to sustain itself and us for<br>
long enough for us to achieve technological breakthroughs that<br>
will render the system irrelevant. (i.e., the "singularity".) If this<br>
is the case, The system is good enough to achieve iits last<br>
purpose, and it's a waste of time to mess with it except perhaps<br>
for minor fixes. Radical modifications tend to have big up-front<br>
costs with fairly long-term payback. I feel we should spend<br>
our time on attempting to advance the technological breakthrough.<br>
