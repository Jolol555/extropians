Assuming that the barber properly finishes his job, he's going to shave <br>
or not shave himself...  He probably does not shave all of his body <br>
hair, or of any other man in the town, so in that sense he shaves <br>
himself to a certain degree. If the question being asked was 'Does the <br>
barber shave all men who do not shave themselves?', one could answer in <br>
a particularly vague fuzzy way, which would be to divide the men of the <br>
town who do not shave themselves minus the barber by the men of the town <br>
who do not shave themselves (1/m), and call the rest of the ratio <br>
ambigous.  So, if the town had 20 men who do not shave themselves, the <br>
barber would shave all men who do not shave themselves to a .95 degree, <br>
with the other .05 being ambigous or paradoxical.  However, this has <br>
nothing to do with Russell's paradox, as the question is whether the <br>
barber shaves himself.  The point of Russell's Paradox was that within <br>
formal logic there is no way out, vague or otherwise(vague being <br>
Russell's term for what we now call fuzzy).  Following the time that he <br>
formulated this paradox, Russell attempted to formulate a system of <br>
logic that would disallow paradoxes, but failed.  Somewhat later Kurt <br>
Godel proved that within any formal system of logic there would be at <br>
least one statement that could not be proved to be true or not true, so <br>
we are trapped with the paradoxical barber forever (at least, the <br>
formalists are).<br>
