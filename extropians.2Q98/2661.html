Cori &lt;Fireeye978@aol.com&gt;,<br>
<p>
	Thanks for the actual reference!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I mean is that in a religion one can always put the "blame" for</i><br>
<i>&gt; unhappiness or disaster or misfortune off on god, or the devil, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever other bugaboos are part of that religion.  An atheist</i><br>
<i>&gt; hasn't that scapegoat available.  We have to shoulder the</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibility ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes.  This is great.  But for me, I must be sure I include the<br>
idea that along with this responsibility or really ability, comes the<br>
possibility that we can make the real natural heaven any way we want<br>
it and not settle with what someone else tells us it must be.  For<br>
some irrational reason, in our religious society, everyone tends to<br>
take the idea that there is no God as we are all there is and we can't<br>
expect any more than what we can do now.  But as I said, this is so<br>
backwards.  The atheist view is the much more optimistic view for we<br>
can hope that a bit more effort (a mere few more thousand years worth)<br>
is all that is required to eliminate evil.  I think that in our<br>
current religious society, we should clearly point this out and not<br>
allow and especially never encourage such twisted misunderstandings.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I really don't think you and I see things all that differently.  </i><br>
<p>
	Yes, definitely.<br>
<p>
		Thanks again,<br>
<p>
