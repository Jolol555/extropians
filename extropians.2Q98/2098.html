<p>
I can say it both ways, I think.  The art is ineffective because its<br>
intention is to, in part, separate the audience from the inside elite.<br>
Yet, while positioned comfortably on the inside, it does has depth.  (Sorry<br>
if this sounds a bit like rattle -:)<br>
<p>
I do think that the content of the art reference in this epoch has value<br>
not only for the cultural content (it does reveal a lot about the times),<br>
and also because abstract art and abstract thought are valuable brainwork.<br>

Yes, I have enjoyed her essays also.<br>
