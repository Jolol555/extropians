It is stated that the speed of light is <br>
not instantaneous, and as such, the light<br>
from distant galaxies is "old light." <br>
<p>
I believe that that idea is illogical.<br>
It is an accepted fact that at the speed<br>
of light, there is no time, time is fixed <br>
at 0, and thus the idea of an "old photon" <br>
is inherently illogical. This means that <br>
as a photon travels, it travels WITH the<br>
instant of its emission and "carries" <br>
that instant with it, and thus the <br>
speed of light = the speed of time.<br>
<p>
The idea that photons travel slow, or<br>
not instantly, assumes that something <br>
travels faster. The idea of the slow <br>
photon rests upon the old fallacy of <br>
a universal time that is synchronized <br>
across all space instantly, and the <br>
photon is slower than universal time. <br>
<p>
Below we see the slow photon traveling <br>
from A to B in separate galaxies. The <br>
photon's travel is not instantaneous <br>
because the universal time synchronizes <br>
the clocks at A and B faster than SOL<br>
(the numbers 0,1,2,3 measure time):<br>
<p>
<p>
   A &amp; B under universal time<br>
<p>
       A                B<br>
      ---              ---<br>
       0*               0<br>
       1    *           1<br>
       2          *     2<br>
       3               *3<br>
<p>
<p>
The transit from A to B was not in-<br>
stantaneous, for the photon reaches <br>
B at a different time than it left A.<br>
But that analysis to totally illogical,<br>
unlike the following analysis where the <br>
photon traveling from A to B reaches B <br>
at the same time it left A because the <br>
speed of light = the speed of time:<br>
<p>
<p>
       A                B<br>
      ---              ---<br>
       0*              -3<br>
       1    *          -2<br>
       2          *    -1<br>
       3               *0<br>
<p>
<p>
Since the photon is always at the same<br>
time in its frame of reference, and as <br>
such is the "speed of time," it reaches <br>
B at the same time it leaves A. <br>
<p>
The idea that the speed of light is not<br>
instantaneous seems to be based upon the <br>
false concept of a universal time that <br>
is uniform across all space and time <br>
(as depicted in the first diagram),<br>
which travels faster than the photon.<br>
<p>
The speed of light is instantaneous <br>
in that a photon is always at the same <br>
instant and reaches all points on its <br>
course through space at the same instant<br>
because it effectively IS that instant. <br>
So it is both not instantaneous from our <br>
point of view, and yet it also is instan-<br>
taneous. So the SOL is both A and -A.<br>
