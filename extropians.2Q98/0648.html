Believe it or not I only recently saw the movie too.<br>
<p>
Yes Hinduism is the largest active religion.  This is because Buddhism is<br>
not allowed in China and no longer practiced much in Japan.  However,<br>
Hinduism has a metaphysical component (sort 0f like the Trinity idea) in<br>
which all of the Hindu pantheon of gods are aspects or manifestations of one<br>
deity called Brahman which includes Brahma (spelled similar huh?), Shiva,<br>
and Vishnu as well as all the other avatars and incarnations that are in the<br>
pantheon.  Interestingly, Buddhism at least in the old school called<br>
Theravada does not believe in any gods at all but anicca or "nothingness".<br>
<p>
Something like 95% believe in a religion of some sort but that includes<br>
animism, shamanism, pantheism and other types of theological positions that<br>
are not monotheism.  Therefore, that comment is not accurate at least in<br>
what it was implying.<br>
<p>
Also, in the movie the extraterrestrial creature from Vega himself never<br>
said that he was any deity nor was he her father.  He said that his<br>
appearance was because "we thought it would be easier for you" thus the<br>
experience was not of Heaven.<br>
<p>
I agree a religiously neutral person would be more objective.<br>

<i>&gt; I recently watched "Contact" (I'm probably the last to do so on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; list) and something's been annoying me ever since.  In the movie it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; claimed that 95% of the worlds population believe in a "Supreme Being"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and therefore anyone who doesn't believe in God shouldn't represent</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth.  Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't Hinduism the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'popular' religion?  Even if it's not, my point is that many religions</i><br>
<i>&gt; have more than one god, so I would presume that 95% of the worlds</i><br>
<i>&gt; population don't believe in a "Supreme Being" or "God" (which I take</i><br>
<i>&gt; to mean one Supreme Being, after all how many Supreme Beings can you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have?)  Added to this, it's a well know fact that religious groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't exactly appreciate each other's views.  Anyone advocating the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian God isn't likely to go down well with other religions that</i><br>
<i>&gt; make up the majority of that 95% (I'm certain 95% of the world aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christians, despite what some of them would like to think).  So</i><br>
<i>&gt; clearly a religiously neutral candidate would have been the best choice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it any different in the book?  And does anyone have figures on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers that make up different religious beliefs, just in case I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever a candidate for first contact and find myself in need of a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense?</i><br>
