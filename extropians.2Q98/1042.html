<i>&gt;    science seek true or false knowledge?</i><br>
<p>
What is true or false knowledge? You can have either useful or useless<br>
knowledge, but true or false is really relative ;-)<br>
<p>
A theory can explain things to you - but even if it's a very good<br>
explanation, it might turn out to be misleading some day. And a theory<br>
can predict things, more or less accurately. Just because a theory gives<br>
a good explanation or predicts things accurately doesn't mean that it's<br>
"true". If you approach science with the ideal to find truth, you'll<br>
either be very frustrated real soon (because no matter how hard you try,<br>
there's no certainty or truth) OR you may find something that looks like<br>
truth to you, which is even worse. Truth doesn't change, so if you think<br>
you found truth, you can't deal with a new theory that contradicts your<br>
"truth" (but might be a LOT better).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    If there are 2 varieties of knowledge,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    and if science is for true knowledge,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    then truth is the true goal of science.</i><br>
<p>
Ever read Popper? "Truth" is absolute - science may get better... btw, I<br>
think the "true" goals of science have changed during history (so they<br>
never were absolutely true - the only true thing was that at that<br>
certain time, people considered those "goals" the goals of science...)<br>
