350 new biotechnology drugs reportedly being developed <br>
<p>

WASHINGTON (April 10, 1998 10:25 a.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) - More than<br>
300 different biotechnology medicines, including vaccines against cancer<br>
and drugs to treat a whole range of diseases, are in development, U.S. drug<br>
makers said Friday.<br>
<p>
Nearly half the drugs in development, 151 out of 350, are meant to fight<br>
cancer, the annual report by Pharmaceutical Research and and Manufacturers<br>
of America (PhRMA) found.<br>
<p>
It said 140 different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies were<br>
working on the drugs.<br>
<p>
"This is a whole new era that we are moving into, and people aren't even<br>
noticing," Dr. John Siegfried, deputy vice president for science and<br>
regulatory affairs at PhRMA, said in a telephone interview.<br>
<p>
"It's an incredibly exciting time to see disease begin to be attacked at<br>
the genetic level, at the chromosome level. My god, when I started to<br>
practice, that was unheard of. It was Buck Rogers stuff, and now it's<br>
happening."<br>
<p>
Biotechnology medicines in development include a flu vaccine being<br>
developed by Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, Chiron Corp's<br>
Proleukin skin cancer drug and Biomira Inc's cancer vaccine.<br>
<p>
Proleukin, already licensed for treating renal cell cancer that has spread<br>
throughout the body, is a genetically engineered version of interleukin-2<br>
(IL-2), a naturally occurring immune system signaling chemical.<br>
<p>
It stimulates the body to destroy abnormal cancer cells.<br>
<p>
Biomira's vaccine alerts the body's immune system to the presence of MUC-1,<br>
a protein found on the surface of 90 percent of common solid tumors<br>
including breast, ovarian and lung cancer. It is being tested in non-small<br>
cell lung cancer, of which there are an estimated 149,000 new cases in<br>
North America each year, killing 133,000 people.<br>
<p>
"We used to think that vaccines were only for diphtheria, pertussis for<br>
kids. and all of a sudden you have tons of vaccines for cancer, as a<br>
preventive in AIDS," said Siegfried.<br>
<p>
The whole point of biotechnology is to tweak the body's own defenses,<br>
Siegfried said.<br>
<p>
"If you look at it holistically, that's really what the body's been doing<br>
all along anyway," he said.<br>
<p>
The road ahead is not all rosy, PhRMA warns. For instance, patent battles<br>
loom, such as a fight over who owns the rights to the BRCA1 and BRCA2<br>
breast cancer genes and a lawsuit over genetically altered seeds that<br>
Mycogen Plant Sciences lost against Monsanto in February.<br>
<p>
"Patent protection is really the basis of our industry and my guess is if<br>
there is a conflict in patents, which is almost inevitable in the genetic<br>
business, they are going to be very hard fought," Siegfried said.<br>
<p>
There were also ethical issues, he said.<br>
<p>
"The whole concept of messing around with genes -- people may say 'I don't<br>
want to do it but if you tell me that messing around with his genes will<br>
save my son then I am going to want to do it'," he said.<br>
<p>
There were plenty of new targets to choose from, the report, which lists<br>
all 350 new medicines, said. With an estimated 100,000 genes in the human<br>
body, and new ones being mapped daily, companies had their work laid out.<br>
<p>
"The modern tools of biotechnology, coupled with computer technology's<br>
ability to analyze massive amounts of data quickly -- help scientists<br>
determine which genes or proteins are defective," it said.<br>
<p>
"We can accomplish in the lab now in a couple of hours what used to take a<br>
year," Siegfried said.<br>
