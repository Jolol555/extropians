Unfortunately, creationism as it is presented in America seems to be a<br>
literal interpretation of the Old Testament, warts and all, and teaches the<br>
Earth is 4000 years old, created with the illusion of age to 'confound the<br>
scientists and Darwinites'...<br>
<p>
When I become a god, I hope to be immune to such petty trifles as demanding<br>
'worship'..I would rather encourage my creations to become my equals and<br>
companions..<br>
