<i>&gt; From: Scott Smith &lt;mssmith@emory.edu&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Is real omnipotence actually possible? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think so. Immortality seems possible, but omnipotence requires</i><br>
<i>&gt; being able to cause anything. Conflicts with other omnipotent beings &gt; would indubitably occur, and then what would happen? Also, the nature &gt; of "quantum causality" seems as if it would prevent omnipotence. </i><br>
<p>
Maybe true omnipotence *can* be achieved if only one Power remains (it<br>
has either killed or absorbed the competition). Given infinite time it<br>
may learn to control everything that exists simultaneously, down to the<br>
smallest particle. It has then effectively *become* the universe.<br>
Unlikely but not impossible.<br>
<p>
Another characteristic of the Judeo-Christian god is that he (yes, of<br>
course he's caucasian male ;-) has *always* existed (and will always<br>
exist). Could this be done? Maybe, if time travel somehow were possible,<br>
one could send copies back "indefinitely", effectively establishing<br>
"presence without beginning or end"?<br>
