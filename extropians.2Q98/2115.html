   IAN: Something that occurred to me that other<br>
   day is in-line with what you say. I'm a very <br>
   visual art-oriented person, and I always had<br>
   trouble with math, but if I can see what's <br>
   the math is describing, bingo, I get it quick.<br>
<p>
   It occurred to me that some others don't have<br>
   to see it to "see it," so to say, and those <br>
   others that I know of are very much not-art-<br>
   istic, very, shall we say, "left-brained," <br>
   to coin the "myth." But what occurred to me <br>
   was that they MUST be seeing it internally,<br>
   and thus people like me may actually have <br>
   a internal visual deficit for which external<br>
   visual stimuli acts as a compensation. This<br>
   would tend to imply that those that we call<br>
   "left brained" actually have some variety of<br>
   advanced internal visualization. I say some <br>
   kind because artists such as myself do have<br>
   strong internal visual capabilities, but in<br>
   the case of fast math learners, this seems <br>
   to map out a utilization of the right side,<br>
   such that, as you note, the idea that math<br>
   isn't utilizing the right side is not true.<br>
