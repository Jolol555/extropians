Gee, I've only heard this debate about, ooh, maybe three hundred times on <br>
this list and others; it's pointless and I have no interest in it. I don't <br>
subscribe to this list for discussions I've already heard three hundred <br>
times before, which could be avoided if you and others would just read a <br>
few of the books on the reading list. <br>
<p>
Not that it matters anyway; if the kind of technologies we're talking <br>
about are possible, then government is dead. It's that simple. You can <br>
talk all you want about governments forcing the rich to pay for the poor, <br>
but the first rich person with a private nuke or -- "Bob" forbid -- grey <br>
goo makes the whole question moot. Government is by its very nature a target-rich environment; you can't govern in secret in any meaningful <br>
way. <br>
<p>
Now, if you want to discuss possible forms of government -- if there are <br>
any -- in a relatively stable posthuman society I'd be quite interested, <br>
but discussions of government policy in the next few decades seem as <br>
useful as discussions of the future of Monarchy in 1770. As far as I'm <br>
concerned we either end up with a massive centralised surveillance state <br>
or an anarchic free market; there's room around those extremes but there <br>
doesn't seem to be any stable middle ground. <br>
