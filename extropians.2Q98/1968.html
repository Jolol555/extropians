<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The reason why dinosaurs that we know</i><br>

<i>&gt; at</i><br>
<i>&gt; a time when all or most of the continents were part of the Pangea super</i><br>
<i>&gt; continent. Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolved sizes of animals and the size of the land mass which they inhabit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So that explains it..."Range Size"...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Small countinents don't have enough grub for really BIG critters...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and it also includes other factors, like the geographic features that limit<br>
an animals range beyond just oceans. Also a really effective big predator will<br>
evolve when there is an oversupply of really big herbivores, yet if it is too<br>
effective, it may kill itself off when it kills off its main food supply, or it<br>
may evolve to be smaller if its constant effective predation restricts its main<br>
food supply. As for the swimming or non-swimming status of brontos, which while<br>
they may not have lived totally submerged, could easily have been merely waders.<br>
Then again, there are plenty of ocean faring dinosaurs which were quite large and<br>
had long necks, and were very nearly the size of brontosaurs.<br>
<p>
Another factor lending to large body size is climate. In a cold climate, large<br>
animals will tend to develop, since you have the ratio of body mass to surface<br>
area in an animal changing drastically the larger you grow. A large animal retains<br>
body heat in a cold climate much easier than a small animal. It is likely,<br>
especially considering the cold-blooded and semi-cold blooded physiques of the<br>
dinosaurs, that they grew in size to better retain body heat in a climate that was<br>
slowly shifting toward the chilly side.<br>
<p>
We can see this during the last ice age, when the woolly mammoth had grown to<br>
almost twice the size of the present elephant, and we had the Cave Bear, a<br>
creature several times the size of the largest grizzlies today, as well as the<br>
Sabre Toothed Lion, which was twice the size of present day mountain lions.<br>
