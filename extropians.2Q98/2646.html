<i>&gt; extropy compared to that which would be lost by</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing so.</i><br>
<p>
In the above paragraph you are judging one answer,<br>
"the right action is that which maximises extropy<br>
over all other possible actions" by another,<br>
Utilitarianism. Clearly this is not logical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I tend to reject the third answer because simple</i><br>
<i>&gt; egoism tends to promote actions which seriously</i><br>
<i>&gt; hurt others, if the agent can pull them off</i><br>
<i>&gt; without getting more punishment than pleasure</i><br>
<i>&gt; from doing the action.</i><br>
<p>
But you're judging Egoism by Utilitarianism, which<br>
does not seem to be a rational way of finding the<br>
correct answer. You cannot say one answer is wrong<br>
because it is not equal to another answer when you<br>
do not know the other answer to be correct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ultimately I believe utilitarianism is correct</i><br>
<i>&gt; because even the modified version of egoism may</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent us from doing something obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational under a variety of situations.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; common example is one in which you might steal</i><br>
<i>&gt; from someone in order to save lives, possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; your own.  An objectivist would quickly point</i><br>
<i>&gt; out that stealing is wrong, and therefore one</i><br>
<i>&gt; should never do so.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure this is obviously rational, I fail to<br>
see why saving lives is a rational act.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, under situations of sufficient urgency,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no other choice may be available (besides</i><br>
<i>&gt; death), and within that context we again seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be forced into the position of accepting bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; consequences when we do the right thing; a</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation which I believe to be paradoxical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Utilitarianism, on the other hand, allows us to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get the consequences we strive for without</i><br>
<i>&gt; sacrificing practical rationality.</i><br>
<p>
But doesn't Utilitarianism promote self-sacrifice?<br>
If your death saves lives (or just makes others<br>
happy), then your death is a good thing.<br>
<p>
Thanks for the detailed reply,<br>
