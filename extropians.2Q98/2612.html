   IAN: How many religious rituals involve<br>
   what would amount to hunting training? <br>
   That seems to be the short rout to the<br>
   answer to your question. Obviously many <br>
   of the early cave painting are associated<br>
   with ritual and with hunting. I believe that<br>
   encounters with psychedelic agents in plants<br>
   and fungi had a MAJOR role in the formation <br>
   of almost all religions and very often was<br>
   the central aspect of religious ritual.<br>
<p>
   As to such ritual as that which you posit <br>
   being "scientific" because it served a useful <br>
   purpose, it then follows that all religion is <br>
   scientific because it fulfills some purpose,<br>
   in fact many purposes: social order, stability,<br>
   fraternity, support systems, a way to rally <br>
   the troops and control the people you want to <br>
   control... religion is scientific mind control!<br>
   That's very useful to those running the religion.<br>
