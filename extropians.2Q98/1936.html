<i>&gt; &gt; Are elephants really near the physical limits? Remember that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; limits of size of an animal also depends a lot on its geometry; a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; two-legged creature cannot get as big as a four-legged one, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; way the bones connect play a great role in the strength of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; structure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (BTW, it is hard to call dinosaurs a hypothesis, since we do indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have their sizeable bones)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; AN elephant's bones are near the tolerance limits for those bone designs using</i><br>
<i>&gt; those bone materials. A Giraffe exerts much more stress on its neck bones than</i><br>
<i>&gt; an elephant does on any of its own. That a giraffe's neck is engineered like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cantilevered truss is much more of a natural engineering feat than the shock</i><br>
<i>&gt; absorbing capabilities of the elephant. The reason why dinosaurs that we know</i><br>
<i>&gt; popularly (most were actually quite small) are so big is that they developed at</i><br>
<i>&gt; a time when all or most of the continents were part of the Pangea super</i><br>
<i>&gt; continent. Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolved sizes of animals and the size of the land mass which they inhabit. For</i><br>
<i>&gt; example the wooly mammoth, of which frozen remnants have been found in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tundra of Siberia, which was larger than the elephant, and carried much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; mass in its tusks than current elephants, as it was slowly killed off by post</i><br>
<i>&gt; ice age man, the last refuges in which its fossils were found to have lived most</i><br>
<i>&gt; recently ( from what I've heard as recently as 4000 BC) were small islands in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the arctic ocean north of Finland. As their food supply was restricted by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; size of their domain as it was cut off from the mainland by rising seas, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; slowly evolved into a 'mammoth' of only 3 or 4 feet in height.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
	Also, it should not be forgotten that the larger, brontosaur types <br>
had the same advantage as whales; contrary to Jurrasic Park, their <br>
bulk was buoyed by the water in which they spent most of their <br>
lives.<br>
	My apologies for my earlier incredulous and sarcastic <br>
response.  Living in the buckle of the bible belt has soured me on <br>
anything that seems to smack of fundamentalist narrowmindedness, and <br>
I will attempt to resist further indulgence in the same type of <br>
behavior I abhor. Sincerely, Joe E. Dees<br>
