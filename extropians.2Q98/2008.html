Title<br>
  Effect on blood pressure of potassium, calcium, and<br>
  magnesium in women with low habitual intake.<br>
Source<br>
  Hypertension.  31(1):131-8, 1998 Jan.<br>
Abstract<br>
  In populations, dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and<br>
  magnesium each have been inversely associated with blood pressure. However,<br>
  most clinical trials in normotensive populations have not found that dietary<br>
  supplements of these minerals lowered blood pressure. We tested the<br>
  hypothesis that normotensive persons who have low habitual intake of these<br>
  minerals would be particularly responsive to supplementation. Three hundred<br>
  normotensive women in the Nurses Health Study II (mean age, 39 years), whose<br>
  reported intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were<br>
  between the 10th and 15th percentiles, received for 16 weeks' duration daily<br>
  supplements of either potassium 40 mmol, calcium 30 mmol<br>
  (1200 mg), magnesium 14 mmol (336 mg), all three minerals together or<br>
  placebos. At baseline, mean (+/-SD) 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures were<br>
  116+/-8 and 73+/-6 mm Hg systolic and diastolic, respectively, and mean<br>
  dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were<br>
  62+/-20 mmol/d, 638+/-265 mg/d, and 239+/-79 mg/d, respectively. The mean<br>
  differences (with 95% confidence intervals) of the changes in systolic and<br>
  diastolic blood pressures between the treatment and placebo groups were<br>
  significant for potassium, -2.0 (-3.7 to -0.3) and -1.7<br>
  (-3.0 to -0.4), but not for calcium, -0.6 (-2.2 to 1.0) and -0.7 (-2.0 to<br>
  0.6), or for magnesium, -0.9 (-2.6 to 0.8) and -0.7 (-2.2 to 0.8). The<br>
  administration of calcium and magnesium with potassium did<br>
  not enhance the effect of potassium alone, and the changes<br>
  in blood pressure were not significant -1.3 (-3.0 to 0.4) and -0.9 (-2.2 to<br>
  0.4). In conclusion, potassium, but not calcium or magnesium<br>
  supplements, has a modest blood pressure-lowering effect in normotensive<br>
  persons with low dietary intake. This study strengthens evidence for the<br>
  importance of potassium for blood pressure regulation in the<br>
  general population.<br>
