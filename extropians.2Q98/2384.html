<p>
Ah.  The argument from tradition.  Which tradition of atomists claims that<br>
you can define motion without a reference frame?  (Hint:  "There is none"<br>
is a perfectly valid answer.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;So, let me get this straight:  The 3 Laws are the right definition, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;therefore my definition is wrong. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: The Three Laws express atomism </i><br>
<i>&gt;    by 100%. Your definition does not.</i><br>
<p>
The right definition expresses atomism by 100%.  The wrong definition does<br>
not.  The above is the logical equivalent of saying "I'm right, and you're<br>
wrong."  In the immortal words of Michael Palin: "This isn't an argument! <br>
It's just contradiction!"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: That idea of independent variance is atomism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   If we take it to the 100% extreme, A is A free from</i><br>
<i>&gt;   any frame of reference.</i><br>
<p>
The "with respect to 0" definition allows for "independent variance" and<br>
does not suffer from reductio ad absurdum.  That anything exists without a<br>
frame of reference is a dubious point, and not one which any modern<br>
atomist would support.<br>
<p>
To wit:  Name a few.  Quote some.  Give an example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   An example of a variation</i><br>
<i>&gt;   occurring free from other features in a frame of </i><br>
<i>&gt;   reference is a "free variation" only relative to </i><br>
<i>&gt;   the whole, and does not measure a degree of atomism.</i><br>
<p>
Again, claiming that independent variance within a reference frame is not<br>
atomism because it is holism is you saying "I'm right and you're wrong." <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: There is no "partial difference." </i><br>
<i>&gt;    There is omission of the full difference.</i><br>
<p>
There IS a partial difference; we define it into existence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: B adds attributes to A, each attribute </i><br>
<i>&gt;    expressing their holistic identity union.</i><br>
<p>
And?  Doesn't change the partial difference one whit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;    IAN: Then 1 also has no identity because </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;    there is no difference between 1 and 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Not unless you're defining your universe with respect to 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     IAN: 1 - 1 = 0, so there is </i><br>
<i>&gt;     no difference between 1 and 1.</i><br>
<p>
And?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: Yes, every point is also a relative </i><br>
<i>&gt;   0 point, which shows how "A to 0" is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   relation that applies to A/0, B/0 and A/B.</i><br>
<p>
Only one point is a relative 0 within any one reference frame; that's all<br>
atomism asserts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: If A = 3 and B = 6 and A changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;   from 3 to 9, A has changed relative </i><br>
<i>&gt;   to both 0 and B. The relation 0/6 is</i><br>
<i>&gt;   many things from many points of view.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   It is large from 0/.03, it is tiny </i><br>
<i>&gt;   from 0/103067472. When we include more </i><br>
<i>&gt;   into our frame of reference we redefine</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the nature of the 0/6 relation. To say </i><br>
<i>&gt;   that the 0/6 relation remains static is </i><br>
<i>&gt;   to negate its relation to anything else.</i><br>
<p>
Not to negate it, simply not to include it in the definition of identity.<br>
