FWIW, I discussed this issue from a slightly different perspective in<br>
THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS, where I commented:<br>
<p>
======================================<br>
<p>
Plainly, it must help if we keep clear that not all dichotomies have the<br>
same force [...].  Aba and Eba are the kinds of grand exclusives which<br>
practitioners of deconstruction are eager to demote, understandably enough<br>
in political terms.  Much vulgar debate, much `common sense', has persisted<br>
in the fallacy that these contraries exhaust the possibilities for<br>
discriminating between categories.  When `man' is contrasted to `woman'<br>
under the Aba/Eba rubric, `woman' will get short shrift indeed in a<br>
phallocentric culture.  But of course there are other and better ways to<br>
distinguish two classes.  <br>
<p>
To define an elephant is not usually to distinguish it from quasars and<br>
English muffins, though the act of definition, by definition, has the<br>
side-effect of excluding it from those and all other non-elephant classes.<br>
 Nor is it even to mark the elephant off from other large landbased<br>
lifeforms.  Rather, a useful definition needs to specify the animal's<br>
positive physiological, evolutionary and ecological characteristics.  In<br>
the context of the Earth's grand ecology, we are far more interested to<br>
learn in what precise ways an elephant metabolises oxygen than to know that<br>
it declines to breath methane or uranium hexafluoride.  <br>
<p>
Yet in the starved terms of post-Saussurean Theory, `elephant' has no<br>
positive term.  It is solely a play of differences from those things which<br>
it is not, as the vocable /cat/ is not /mat/, /bat/, or /can/.  But while<br>
in a strict sense it is true that to define an elephant is to exclude<br>
everything else in the universe from that set, it is a long and<br>
debilitating step from this elementary truism of logic to the view [of<br>
Julia Kristeva and Elizabeth Grosz] that we thus construct for the elephant<br>
`an "other" in which it can cast all that it is incapable of accepting or<br>
desiring in itself'.<br>
<p>
Another way to make the point is this: let us posit that we may distinguish<br>
a given entity from the rest of universe by a number of paths (assuming<br>
that our discourse permits us to make discriminations in the first place;<br>
if not we can abandon the possibility of logic at once).  `A' can be<br>
divided from `non-A'.  Some boundary thus separates `A' from the rest of<br>
the universe (at least in terms of some set of defining conditions).  But<br>
we can also distinguish `A1' from `A2', and from [`A2' through `An'], or<br>
perhaps as well from members of other classes such as `B1', or [`B1'<br>
through `Bn'].  Indeed, only if we divide `A1' off from [`A2' through `Nn']<br>
are we back to `A' and `non-A'.  But I hope it is clear that the simple act<br>
of binary discrimination need not have a single effect, for good or ill,<br>
since it can be performed in many different ways.  Post-structural Theory's<br>
attack on binarisation appeals to a more fundamental metaphysical problem<br>
in determining just what is inside the boundaries of these `A's and `N's.<br>
