I've read that paper too (I think in Nature about five months ago), <br>
and it's quite nice. The fact that people blind from an early stage <br>
can use their visual cortex to process tactile information is one <br>
among several phenomena that shows the remarkable plasticity of the <br>
human neonate's brain. That is a good omen for the bottom-up approach <br>
to superintelligence. (Because if any area of the cortex can be <br>
trained to perform most any function, then that rules out the <br>
hypothesis that adult-level performance depends on highly elaborate, <br>
genetically determined cognitive modules.)<br>
<p>
I wonder if transcranial magnetic stimulation could be used for <br>
recreational purposes, by noninvasively stimulating the pleasure <br>
centres? (At least it would be legal for some time before the <br>
legislators caught up with the development.)<br>
