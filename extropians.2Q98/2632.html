<p>
You blame God, who may or may not be there, for the act of a man who admits he<br>
hears voices.  Seems to me you just made the mistake he did.<br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; 2) Evil will be overcome once all human beings finish living out</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; their lives and making choices on earth (you could probably imagine</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; all sorts of theologies to support such an idea).  Evil is currently</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; necessary because the possibility of it must exist for free will to</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; exist.</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;  	Ah, the old perverted blame evil on free will theodicy.  Yeah,</i><br>
<i> &gt;  free will makes a great scapegoat for God right!??  First off, placing</i><br>
<i>  &gt; the blame on free will (free will in this view must be bad or</i><br>
<i> &gt;  malevolent since it is the cause of evil), to me, is far worse than</i><br>
<i> &gt;  thinking that God is actually malevolent or the cause of evil.  To me,</i><br>
<i> &gt;  free will is something good and glorious and when perfectly achieved</i><br>
<i> &gt;  by all will finally eliminate all evil.  Since evil is, by definition,</i><br>
<i> &gt;  that which we don't want.</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt;  	The fundamental premise behind such agency theodicies is that</i><br>
<i> &gt;  in order to be free we must be allowed to choose that which we don't</i><br>
<i> &gt;  really want (what evil or bad, by definition, is.)  But this is</i><br>
<i> &gt;  logically absurd.  You can't choose that which you don't really want</i><br>
<i> &gt;  to choose if one is really free.  Anything that causes us to deviate</i><br>
<i> &gt;  from making the best possible (i.e. non evil) choices, whether it be</i><br>
<i> &gt;  ignorance, lack of proper upbringing, inadequate brain wiring/mental</i><br>
<i> &gt;  illness/chemical imbalance... or improper training, or even due to</i><br>
<i>  &gt; randomness in nature destroys our agency or ability to get what we</i><br>
<i>  &gt; really want.  Only when we can overcome all such causes and finally</i><br>
<i>  &gt; deterministically always make the best possible (i.e. non evil)</i><br>
<i>  &gt; choices will we finally have true free will.  Surely any true God</i><br>
<i>  &gt; would always deterministically make the right choices or he would not</i><br>
<i>  &gt; be God right?  Such a being would be the only being with true free</i><br>
<i> &gt;  will or ability to make all the right choices.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; 	True, it would be evil for God to do something like put us in</i><br>
<i>  &gt; chains and force us to always do what He (but not us) knows is right.</i><br>
<i> &gt;  But instead of this, I have faith that a real God could adequately</i><br>
<i> &gt;  educate us and help us achieve the strength and knowledge and so on</i><br>
<i> &gt;  required to always make the right choices on our own.  Non of us are</i><br>
<i> &gt;  truly free yet, we achieve more and more freedom or ability to get</i><br>
<i> &gt;  what we really want every day via technology and progress.  I have</i><br>
<i> &gt;  faith that some day we will all achieve perfect freedom.  All evil</i><br>
<i> &gt;  will finally be removed (or simply not chosen) after such a day.  What</i><br>
<i>  &gt; possible reason could there be for God not giving us more of a helping</i><br>
<i> &gt;  hand with overcoming all this lack of freedom and evil now if he is</i><br>
<i> &gt;  really out there!?  Should we really try to accept that there is such</i><br>
<i> &gt;  a reason no matter how "beyond is" and incomprehensible such a reason</i><br>
<i> &gt; must be?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; 	And finally, the biggest reason this free will theodicy is so</i><br>
<i>  &gt; perverse is because of the hate and intolerance that must go along</i><br>
<i>  &gt; with it.  Some people freely choose good.  We are to love these</i><br>
<i>  &gt; people.  Some people freely choose evil.  We are to hate and be</i><br>
<i>  &gt; intolerant of these people (rather than try to be sympathetic of why</i><br>
<i>  &gt; the particular evil choices might have been made and having a hope</i><br>
<i>  &gt; that we might help).  We should work to destroy, or at best cast them</i><br>
<i>  &gt; all out of our presence because nothing God can do, and especially</i><br>
<i>  &gt; nothing we, who are much less than God, can do can help their evil</i><br>
<i>  &gt; free will.  It seems to me that 99% of the hate and intolerance in</i><br>
<i>  &gt; the world is directly due to this very popular, yet hideously</i><br>
<i>  &gt; misguided notion of this kind of malevolent "free will".</i><br>
<i>  &gt; Unconditional love is incompatible with any religion that holds such</i><br>
<i>  &gt; as a doctrine, for the Devil (and any followers) must be hated and if</i><br>
<i>  &gt; not destroyed, cast out and eternally punished.</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;  	To me, free will is not malevolent and is exactly compatible</i><br>
<i>  &gt; with the non existence of evil.  As long as there is evil, no one is</i><br>
<i>  &gt; yet truly free.  I will eternally have faith that such perfection is</i><br>
<i>  &gt; possible and will eternally strive for such with unconditional love</i><br>
<i>  &gt; for all.</i><br>
<p>
Evil exists whether or not free will exists.  Free will allows us to make the<br>
choice, for ourselves, between the two.  Some people, for whatever reason,<br>
will choose differently from others.  What you want might not be the same<br>
thing.   Is it therefore evil?  Jerry Falwell says yes.  In any case, the only<br>
people who don't believe in free will are the Calvinists and the Astrology<br>
nuts.  A good chunk of the remainder believes that man is essentially good at<br>
heart.  Admittedly, not many of them happen to be Southern Baptists, but the<br>
point is that evil has absolutely nothing to do with the basis of free will.<br>
It exists as a choice.  God cannot force that us to choose Good, because to do<br>
so would destroy that which makes us seperate from God.  <br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; 3) Evil will be overcome once those who are evil see the error of</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; their ways.  Given that to be evil an agent must be capable of</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; rational thought (ignoring for a moment the problem of how a</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; rational agent can do evil), it seems plausible that over time all</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; evil agents will see the irrational path they follow and become</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; good, thus overcoming evil.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; 	Exactly!  And only then will they be free.  Again, why could a</i><br>
<i>  &gt; real God not help us achieve this freedom now!?</i><br>
<p>
Let's say God has his own personal version of the Heisenberg Uncertainty<br>
principle.  He cannot reach down and make us any different from what we are<br>
because to do so would destroy that which makes us seperate from him.<br>
Besides, who the hell would want that?  Whether or not we succeed or fail is<br>
so far entirely up to us.  Whats the point of attaining a goal if you cannot<br>
do it on your own?  The only people who want God to "help us achieve this<br>
freedom now" are the fundamentalists with the bumper stickers that say  "In<br>
case of Rapture, this car will be unmanned".  I would spit in the eye of such<br>
a God.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; Reasons for thinking that 2 is not entailed by some reason R that</i><br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; reconciles God with evil:</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; 1) God does not overcome evil because he has voluntarily undertaken</i><br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; to somehow remove himself from this universe, in order to give the</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; beings here, say, greater responsibility.  However, since we are</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; here, and somehow can, we should overcome evil.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; 	The idea that God for some reason must "voluntarily undertake</i><br>
<i> &gt;  to somehow remove himself" from us is about the most depressing idea I</i><br>
<i> &gt;  can imagine.  True love means being with someone, helping someone...</i><br>
<i> &gt;  Love is not dieing, going away, or isolating one's self from those</i><br>
<i> &gt;  they love!  True, mortal parents can sometimes be overbearing and it</i><br>
<i>  &gt; is sometimes good to get out from "under their wing" but must I accept</i><br>
<i>  &gt; that an all powerful God suffers from such mortal foibles as our</i><br>
<i>  &gt; mortal parents sometimes do?  Such ideas just seem absurd and/or</i><br>
<i>  &gt; hateful to me.  I would hope that I can always be with a true God and</i><br>
<i>  &gt; that I would never have to be isolated or separated from him.</i><br>
 <br>
Sorry for the upcoming cliche, but I hate to be told what true love is.  "If<br>
you love something, set it free..."<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt; &gt; 2) God is the creator and source of ethical law, and above ethical</i><br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; law.  Therefore the fact that we should overcome evil according to</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; this ethical law does not mean that God should also overcome evil.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; 	OK!  My God is the Devil.  Whatever evil he commands should be</i><br>
<i>  &gt; done.  Anyone that deviates from all such absolute decrees will burn</i><br>
<i>  &gt; in hell for eternity!  This is such a lame and devilish reason!  Good</i><br>
<i> &gt;  is good and bad is bad.  Anything that is Good is Godly and anything</i><br>
<i>  &gt; that is Bad is devilish.  That is the only possible way to know the</i><br>
<i>  &gt; difference.  If this is not true, then there is nothing rational at</i><br>
<i>  &gt; all and no way to know the difference.</i><br>
<p>
Once again, you're blaming God for what man says and does.  Just because Oral<br>
Roberts claims that he speaks for God doesn't mean you judge God by what he<br>
says.  Of course, the people that believe him deserve whatever is coming to<br>
them<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;&gt; Now I certainly find many of those reasons as repugnant and</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; implausible as you do.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Undoubtedly for some of the same reasons I've described.</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;&gt; But they show that a reconciliation of God with evil does not</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; NECESSARILY lead to either 1 or 2.  And that was my point.</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;	So, then, you think it is OK to hate devils and all their</i><br>
<i>  &gt; worshipers, as long as we can still have faith in our God!?  This is</i><br>
<i>  &gt; only one of many many reasons why I just can't see how anyone can make</i><br>
<i>  &gt; such points.  Thinking like this just makes more evil, hate, and</i><br>
<i>  &gt; despair.  If we have true faith that all might be possible one way or</i><br>
<i>  &gt; another we need not accept any of this evil and despair.</i><br>
<p>
If God is Good, then things that  make "more evil, hate, and despair"  don't<br>
come from him.  They come from us, because we happen to be imperfect beings at<br>
the moment.  If we are striving to better ourselves, thru Transhumanist<br>
thought, or Christianity or Wicca or Chess, then we will becfome less<br>
imperfect, which will supposedly lead to a general condition of more "good".<br>
I kind of doubt it, but I'll admit the possibility is there.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; I'd say that that's a particularly argumentative way of describing</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; what a theodicy is.  If the presence of evil is truly justified,</i><br>
<i>  &gt; &gt; then it hasn't "twisted" anything in showing it to be justified.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt; 	Yes, I can see your point.  But accepting any such evil, for</i><br>
<i>  &gt; whatever justification, is the lessor theory.  The theory that a way</i><br>
<i>  &gt; can be found to eliminate all such evil is the greater theory.</i><br>
<i>  &gt; Hopping for the greater theory is having faith, accepting the lessor</i><br>
<i>  &gt; is giving up in despair.  We should never give up hope that something</i><br>
<i>  &gt; better might be possible.  I always hope that there might be some way</i><br>
<i>  &gt; or another found to eliminate all evil and will eternally seek after</i><br>
<i>  &gt; such!</i><br>

If you eliminate evil, how do you judge what good is?<br>
