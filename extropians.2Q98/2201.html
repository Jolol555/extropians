 IAN: By 100%. Fuzzy logic measures a mismatch <br>

 "the cup is full" but it is only 70% full,<br>
 then there is a 30% mismatch = 30% false.<br>

<p>
<p>
  IAN: Then that's the truth, by 100%. The photon <br>
  is at zero time, so it's both at here/now and<br>
  the point it was 10-years ago. That's the truth.<br>
  I don't believe reality contains a falsehood.<br>
