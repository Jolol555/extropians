&lt;&lt; Are you a later-born, Anders?  Max?  Natasha?  Greg?  Keith?  John?<br>
Anyone? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
hmmm... i'm in the middle...and quite imaginative...and extremely skeptical...<br>
<p>
skeptical at least of claims to powers/abilities/knowledge that aren't<br>
repetively demonstrable.   time and a gian i've read of so and so who can<br>
predict such and such or telekinesis or what have you... i haven't anything<br>
against believing these folks..i'd love it if such were possible... but show<br>
me!  step out to the corner with me and grab a fellow and random and tell me<br>
how much change he has in his pockets...<br>
levitate my car into the air... too heavy?..fine i'll settle for my car<br>
keys... do it again... and again... in front of others.  this whole idea of<br>
the "powers" not working if i "don't believe" or if the wind is coming from<br>
the southeaast or if i'm wearing a blue shirt or whatever the excuse is, is<br>
what makes me and most others doubt the claimants... <br>
<p>
the sheer amount of fakery and fraud associated with the field is not the<br>
fault of the skeptics after all. disbelief and a roll of the eyes is to be<br>
expected in an area so rife with lousy controls, unduplicated data, wild<br>
claims from all corners and outright liars... psychic friends network<br>
anyone?... yeesh... <br>
