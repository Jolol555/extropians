I'll second this.  I happened to catch this no-name show on Friday nights<br>
while in high school five years ago.  I've loved it ever since.<br>
<p>
(Mulder-enlightenment deletia)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The best thing about the show is that the main character can reject years of</i><br>

<p>
But our friend Chris Carter has generously provided us with a balance in<br>
Agent Scully.  A medical doctor with years of thorough scientific training,<br>
she was taken to the brink of death with this inoperable naso-pharyngeal<br>
cancer, and one of the four possible reasons for her remission was...<br>
<p>
a sudden turn back to the church and prayer to Incorporeal Deities,<br>
Incorporated.<br>
<p>
(Then again, the more believable reason was the reimplantation of the<br>
tracking chip in her neck...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My favorite episode was the one with Charlse Nelson Riley writing a book about</i><br>
<i>&gt;a UFO abduction.  </i><br>
<p>
I found the one with the cryonic neuro-suspension patient controlling his<br>
still-living autistic brother mildly amusing, as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I find the show to be very extropian, and very true to life.  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt;confilicting information in the show.  </i><br>
<p>
That's the golden part.  We get our choice of causes- (1) government<br>
deception and interference, (2) faith in the supernatural, and (3) help from<br>
the aliens.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if everything in the X-files were literally true, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;still would not believe in aliens while a true believer would think that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;existance of aliens was indisputeable.  I don't know how much more realistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;they could get.</i><br>
<p>
I guess we'll find out the answer to that this weekend.  (Fight The<br>
Future... I'm _so_ sure...)<br>
