Hmm.. Because I'm not a scientist, but an artist, there's less reason in<br>
this statement than you are probably hoping for. I'm saying this based on<br>
intuition and a lifetime of growing up around the Silicon Valley/Bay Area.<br>
I've always thought that bold advances in any high-technology are the<br>
result of a synergy of theoretical ideas melding together. When it comes to<br>
the technology needed to scan the brain, I think it will be the product of<br>
one incredible idea/device connected to some existing technology. I'm sure<br>
that you could argue this is graduated science.. So I guess that part of my<br>
statement is a bit off target.. But I do believe that we'd need something<br>
revolutionary to make this first step towards U/Ling. Perhaps it will be<br>
Nano, but I imagine it much farther away than some alternative brain<br>
scanning device.<br>
