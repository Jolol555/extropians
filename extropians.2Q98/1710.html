OK, we appear to be in agreement about the following. Please correct<br>
this if my oversimplification has introduced errors.<br>
  1) we will be using nanotech to build simple stuff (i.e., most machine parts and<br>
     components for buildings) well before 2015<br>
  2) we will not use nanotech to build complicated stuff (potatoes, beefsteak,<br>
     "anything box") until we achieve a breakthough in control systems such as AI.<br>
<p>
We appear to disagree on the boundary between "simple" and "complex".<br>
I place a desktop-sized supercomputer factory in the "simple" category.<br>
I can't tell for sure, but you seem to disagree? It would be fun to<br>
rank-order a set of parts or devices and see where each of us places<br>
the boundary. We could each place the rank-ordered devices on a timeline,<br>
except we both agree that a breakthrough is needed, more or less implying a<br>
bimodal distribution.<br>
<p>
I also believe that there is at least a chance that the availability of<br>
nanotech-built massively parallel supercomputers will enable a path to<br>
AI, which in turn could permit a nanotech control system that can enable<br>
us to build complicated stuff. You appear to think this unlikely?<br>
<p>
We also disagree on the rate of adoption of even the "simple stuff"<br>
technology. I feel that the rate will be very rapid, while you think<br>
it will take a decade. In essence, I feel that after the time that the<br>
first macro-scale part (brick, tennis racket handle, whatever) there will<br>
be no new orders for new non-nanotech capital equipment, and within a year<br>
most simple hard-good parts will be diamondoid. In the same time, nanocomputing<br>
will completely supercede microlithographic-based computing.<br>
