Because it's true nonetheless.  But sure, if you like.<br>

<p>
This is completely invalid.  They are "not atomist" by YOUR definiton of<br>
atomism, which is the very subject under debate!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    I agree that half of the difference is </i><br>
<i>&gt;    half of the difference, and half defines</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the whole by default. If I give you $50 </i><br>
<i>&gt;    and say this is half of the fee, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    identity of the whole fee is revealed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    so the ID of the whole is in the half.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    The area just outside the letter A defines </i><br>
<i>&gt;    it as much as the area inside the letter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Its identity contains both areas.</i><br>
<p>
My point is that most people define the fee differently, such that if I<br>
tell you that "this is only part of the fee" you STILL know the identity<br>
of what I've given you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: It's really not true to say that I omitted</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the portion that you added to the Three Laws since</i><br>
<i>&gt;    they've never been published your way. Your version</i><br>
<i>&gt;    is holistic, since adding "with respect to" includes</i><br>
<i>&gt;    a relation. It's clear that you've changed the defin-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    tion of atomism to a holistic definition, but kept the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    "atomist" label on it, for what reason I know not, ex-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    cept to be able to say you've evidenced atomism.</i><br>
<p>
Argh.  This is really frustrating.  I'm really resisting the urge to use<br>
all caps.  I'm going to use asterisks instead, because you seem to be<br>
mising this extremely simple point.  *I have not changed the definition of<br>
atomism, I have stated the correct one.  That it agrees with holism does<br>
not mean that it is wrong.*<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Isn't that proving how effective product A is in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;    demonstration using product H with an A label on it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    or more exactly, by using a mix of 2/3 H and 1/3 A?</i><br>
<p>
Don't you get it?  What you think is A *IS NOT A*., I'm telling you what A<br>
is and you keep telling me "Wait!  It's got H in it!  It must not be A!" <br>
This is completely invalid because A and H only disagree under your<br>
definition, which is PRECISELY what I am challenging.  A really is H, H<br>
really is A.  No sleight of hand, no changing the label: I'm telling you,<br>
honest to goodness, this product called H is also A.  They're the same<br>
product.  That I can change the label and still be right should be<br>
evidence of that.<br>
<p>
I find this frustrating, I'm now realizing, because I keep trying to say<br>
the same thing, and you're not actually responding, you're just falling<br>
back to your previous definition and saying "See?  Therefore your<br>
definition is wrong."  I do not accept your definition of atomism.  I<br>
challenge you to defend it.  I do not accept your asertion that A and H<br>
disagree by 100%.  I agree that YOUR conception of atomism disagrees with <br>
holism by 100%: I assert that your definition is wrong.  I challenge you<br>
to defend it using logical terms upon which we both agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: When I refer to the high, I refer to </i><br>
<i>&gt;    the low by default;  when I refer to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;    good, I refer to the bad by default...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;    How is it that I don't refer to the whole?</i><br>
<p>
Simple:  you have made the dualistic fallacy.  Sure, in a universe<br>
consisting of only two objects, by looking at both you observe the whole. <br>
However, when you look at a universe with THREE objects, observing the<br>
relationship between two is NOT looking at the whole, but is nonetheless<br>
valid as a partial diffrerence.  Our definitions disagree in that atomists<br>
define that identity comes from the relationship between the object in<br>
question and another object which is defined to have no identity called<br>
"0."  (Let me stop you before you start.  0 has no identity because there<br>
is no difference between 0 and 0.  Under your definition of identity, this<br>
does not define the identity of 0.  I'm aware of that.  I'm CHALLENGING<br>
your definition.  Do not use it to defend your argument, use ANOTHER<br>
definition to defend your DEFINITION.)<br>
<p>
The identity of A is defined as the difference between itself and the 0; <br>
while we could then go on to observe 0's relationship to B, and then draw<br>
conclusions about the relationship between A and B (if we knew what B<br>
was!), the relationship between B and A does not define the identity of<br>
anything.  Only the difference between A and 0 defines A's identity under<br>
this definition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: Not true. "Net difference" is not a </i><br>
<i>&gt;    violation of the definition of difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I say that the difference between 4 and </i><br>
<i>&gt;    5 is expressed as 4 - 5 = -1. That's the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    standard definition. So saying that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;    net difference is -1 &amp; 1, is not unique;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    observing that it is the holisitc struc-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    ture of identity is unique.</i><br>
<p>
This not an observation, it is a definition.  I could just as easily<br>
define identity to be only the partial difference and make just as much<br>
sense.  I'm telling you that this is what atomists do, and that is why<br>
holists and atomists are both right, by virtue of the fact that they agree<br>
100%.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    What seems to be demolished in your </i><br>
<i>&gt;    analysis is any difference between </i><br>
<i>&gt;    atomism and holism, for to sustain</i><br>
<i>&gt;    atomism you've changed it to holism.</i><br>
<p>
I've not changed it, I'm telling you what it always has been.  Atomism as<br>
you believe it to be is completely wrong: it is wrong as a theory and it<br>
is wrong as a definition.  You don't know or understand what atomism is,<br>
and so you prop up a straw man definition and proclaim it wrong.<br>
Congratulations: you have deflated a theory which no one believes.  In<br>
reality, however, atomism is and has always been as I define it.  I am<br>
right because people use my definition and not yours.  Drop your<br>
definition of atomism and you'll understand the rest of the world by a far<br>
greater degree.<br>
