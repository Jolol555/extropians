<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: I would be interested to know where you get </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; your definition of "atomism." I get mine from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the classical Three Laws of Thought that define </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the structure of atomist identity (in short):</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 1) A is A.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 2) A is not both A and not-A.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 3) A is either A or not-A.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This defines a clear demarkation around A that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; excludes holism by 100% and thus is atomism by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 100%. What definition of atomism is more exact?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, MINE for one. :)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: OK, so you made up that definition<br>
   while I used the traditional definition <br>
   of atomism, no problem; but then you say...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;... to be blunt, I would never use the word "Identity" with </i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone else in the same way I use it when talking with you...</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By adopting the definitions of your "opponent" while remembering the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth, you can gain a better understanding of their position, and are also</i><br>
<i>&gt;more convincing with your own position. You might even discover that</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're saying the same thing. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I think that atomism defined by the Three Laws<br>
   of Thought and "mystical" as "holism" are the logical,<br>
   indicated, and standard definitions. The definitions you <br>
   have presented are not indicated and are nonstandard, so <br>
   the implication that I've modified definitions to suit <br>
   my metaphysics is unfounded and contraindicated; in <br>
   fact I have addressed the standing definitions!<br>
<p>
   It's true that "1 = 0" could be a definition of mysticism,<br>
   but it's one that does not explain what it's saying, it's<br>
   like erasing part of an explanation (the -1 part). If<br>
   we model the case of a school of thought by erasing <br>
   critical data that is required to understand their<br>
   position, we will not be able to understand it.<br>
   The point is that 1 =&gt; (1 + (-1)) which = 0.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Your definition of atomism desribes a meta-rela-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; tion of three relations (A,B), (A,0), and (B,0) </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and observes that as (A,B) changes, the other </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; two remain static, true! But that's NOT a defin-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; tion of identity, atomist or holist, and thus </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is not a standard by which the "right" or the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "wrong" defintion is to be determined. So:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; * Why is "atomist identity" as defined by the 3 </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Laws of Thought a "wrong" definition of atomism?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (Our disagreements revolve around definitions, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and it seems that we agree on everything else.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, it's basically this problem: lots of people consider themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomists (myself included!) because I believe that one can define the</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity of A in terms of its relationship to only PART of its holistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity and still make sense. More precisely, I'd say that identity of A</i><br>
<i>&gt;(as defined by holism) is governed by *everything* that is not-A; but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomist's definition of identity (which I'll call partial identity to</i><br>
<i>&gt;avoid confusion) is simply the relationship between A and a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;other value; usually 0. The net identity is the sum of the partial</i><br>
<i>&gt;identities of everything relative to everything else, which is always 0.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Yes, so we mostly agree, and it seems your <br>
   definition of atomism is "semi-holism" if not 100% <br>
   holism, which means it's not real atomism. Your a <br>
   holist, not an atomist. The relation of 2 or 7 to <br>
   0 must be static, since it is a static relation <br>
   by definition. This relation does evidence atomism.<br>
<p>
   The relation of A or B to 0 may not be static; <br>
   for example, if A is a car and A is moving at <br>
   35 mph relative to a fixed point of reference <br>
   that we say is moving at 0 mph, and A accele-<br>
   rates to 40mph, the relation of A to 0 has <br>
   changed. But if B followed A exactly, then <br>
   that relation has not changed (as you note), <br>
   yet then we have a relation of change to <br>
   not-change, which is holism, not atomism:<br>
<p>
   [(A,B) = static relative to (A,0)] = holism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the previous world consisting of A and B, we can see that one partial</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity is that A is one greater than 0 and another is that B is two</i><br>
<i>&gt;greater than zero; the latter partial identity may change without</i><br>
<i>&gt;affecting the truth of the former partial identity: B may grow to twenty</i><br>
<i>&gt;greater than zero, but A will remain one greater than 0. Since 0 will</i><br>
<i>&gt;become twenty less than B in the process, the whole identity of A will</i><br>
<i>&gt;change, eventually leaving the net identity zero. However, the truth of</i><br>
<i>&gt;partial identities are not necessarily affected by changes in other</i><br>
<i>&gt;partial identities, and thus, to some extent, partial identities are</i><br>
<i>&gt;"atomistic" in the sense that they exhibit some degree of independence,</i><br>
<i>&gt;even though the total identity cannot behave in this way, and even though</i><br>
<i>&gt;the identity of the partial identities themselves will be affected as that</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is not-"partial identity" changes. The important thing for</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomists is that the truth of a partial identity can remain unchanged by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the truth of other partial identities; perhaps truth itself is just a</i><br>
<i>&gt;partial identity of any given statement.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: If in holism we have A and -A, it follows<br>
   that we would have change and not-change, so <br>
   I don't see that citing examples of not-change<br>
   in a whole wherein there is change defines atom-<br>
   ism since it presents no example outside holism.<br>
<p>
   One way to look at it is, if we need to <br>
   whole to observe X, we're defining holism. <br>
   The example you cite relies upon the whole.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is useful in many cases where I don't know certain values on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity matrix, but I can nonetheless say things about the partial</i><br>
<i>&gt;identities I do know; I may even use the fact that net identity is equal</i><br>
<i>&gt;to zero in order to find unknown values on the table. As you can see,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is totally compatible with holism, and yet smacks of atomism.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Excellent points! I think we agree even <br>
   more. What your referring to as "atomism" is <br>
   what I've seen as my analysis has progressed<br>
   over time that what we call atomism IS in holism,<br>
   that the two are not antithetical: the get parts<br>
   you need the whole. My point though is that the <br>
   100% atomist definition I cited never holds up.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;So my definition, in the clearest form you'll get from me at this hour:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Atomism is the statement that the truth of partial identities does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessarily change as other partial identities change.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: But it will in that if A and B stay the <br>
   same size, and C is also the same, but then <br>
   C grows larger, A dn B get smaller by relation.<br>
   And when we say A and B are not changing, we <br>
   say that relative to change. If there was no<br>
   change in the universe, "no-change" would not<br>
   be a definable concept.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;When most people say "identity" they mean partial identity; similarly when</i><br>
<i>&gt;they say "space" they mean partial space, and when they say "time" they</i><br>
<i>&gt;mean partial time. If the best definition is that which is best</i><br>
<i>&gt;understood, you are better off saying that identity, space and time can</i><br>
<i>&gt;all be non-zero (again, meaning partials) but that the sum of all</i><br>
<i>&gt;identities relative to all other identities is zero and that this is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;whole truth.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    IAN: But when I refer to part A I refer to <br>
    part -A by exclusion. When I say look at <br>
    that bird, I saying something about all <br>
    else, I say "Don't look at all else,"<br>
    and thus I refer to all by default.<br>
    I may not list all that is in all<br>
    else, and so to I may not list <br>
    every feature of the bird.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Similarly, when people refer to mysticism, they usually intimate something</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is not predicted by Newtonian physics actually taking place.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, as we can clearly see, your theories of identity and Newtonian</i><br>
<i>&gt;physics go hand in hand; you cannot use the identity matrix to prove</i><br>
<i>&gt;that psychic phenomena are possible or that reality is infinitely</i><br>
<i>&gt;malleable by the human mind or that 0 = 1; all of these are popular</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclusions of mysticism as practiced and defined by others. This reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;alone may be sufficient reasoning to abondonit.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    IAN: Yes, and that's the crux of the issue here.<br>
    The traditional concept of "mystical" is something<br>
    that is antithetical to logical and physics. I have<br>
    had the "mystical experience, white light and the <br>
    awareness of eternal and infinte being (really <br>
    awasome!), so I'm defining what that mystical <br>
    experience "told me" about reality. It told<br>
    me that all things are connectd, that no<br>
    thing is free from the All, and that <br>
    each things contains All by relation.<br>
<p>
    Feeling that this "mystical" eperience has <br>
    been wrongfully defined as something other <br>
    than the profound experience of the logical<br>
    union of all things, I've sought to map out<br>
    the reality that is seen during "the light."<br>
    It's my feeling that its UN-mystical, that <br>
    it's a phenomenal explosion of intelligence.<br>
<p>
    So my saying "mystical validation" skirts two<br>
    worlds, in that it does not purport to say <br>
    anything about Gods, ghosts, psychics... but<br>
    simply that this type of experience that is<br>
    defined as "mystical" and what is seen to <br>
    be the truth during it, is in fact logical.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;... I even begun to convince you that we atomists aren't so</i><br>
<i>&gt;bad after all. (A task which a series of great minds on this list have</i><br>
<i>&gt;apparently tried and failed to do.) </i><br>
<p>
    IAN: I disagree with that. I think that I've<br>
    clearly shown that the example of a not-changing <br>
    relation amidst changin realtions is not an exmaple<br>
    of atomism, but of holism, since C is C realti to not-C.<br>
    Also, the not-C relation changes it's relative identity<br>
    (such as becoming bigger, slower, smaller, faster...)<br>
    relative to C. Similarly, no other exampls have been <br>
    shown of A that is A free, so I totally refute the <br>
    implication that you and others have been providing <br>
    evidence that holism is less than 100% absolute.<br>
