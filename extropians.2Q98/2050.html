<i>&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, any time you put a CD in a drive, or any other</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; virus a go at your system. Granted you could use a specially rigged CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; copying machine, but these are expensive devices, not likely to be owned</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by the casual pirate. This cost of entry limits potential pirates to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those with the capital to take the risk. Thus this limits the potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pirates, and eases enfocement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; the drive might read the boot sector of the disk, but it does not execute</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  AFAIK, you cannot get a virus simply by sticking the disk in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; drive, and even if you read data from the floppy you still cannot get the</i><br>
<i>&gt; boot record virii (unless, of course, you execute a program on the floppy</i><br>
<i>&gt; which contains the virus).</i><br>
<p>
I have a floppy disk in hand with a benign Stealth C variant virus. In order to<br>
get your virus protection software to go all bongo over this virus on this<br>
floppy, all you have to do is stick it in the drive. Do nothing else. You also<br>
do not need to be in Windows for this to happen. It does the same thing in DOS.<br>
I have tested this myself, as I keep the floppy as a good way to safely test<br>
antivirus software installations with real virii that do no damage.<br>
<p>
BTW, if you want a copy of this virus, all you have to do is exchange files over<br>
the internet with anyone on a PC at Sturm Ruger, Inc. Their entire network is<br>
infested with it, or was the last I heard. Be sure to have your antivirus<br>
software on when you receive it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only way to get a boot sector virus,</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside executing an executable with a virus, is to boot from a floppy, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which case the disk's boot sector gets loaded by the BIOS and executed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is the reason why boot sector virii are almost extincts since the</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to boot from floppy is extinct.  Same as above holds for CDs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reading data cannot heart, executing it does.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I was under the impression that the Stealth C variant virus I have on a disk is<br>
a boot sector virus. If stealth viruses are not boot sector types, please let me<br>
know....<br>
