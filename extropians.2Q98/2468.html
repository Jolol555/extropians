I'll play devil's advocate and pretend I'm a creationist. If c was only <br>
slightly larger fusion reactions would release so much energy the sun would <br>
blow apart. Even more important, if c were faster it would be easy to program <br>
an AI, no need for clever programming or fancy algorithms, to solve a problem <br>
just look at every possibility, even if there were an infinite number of <br>
things to check it would be no problem if c was instantaneous. The trouble is <br>
God might not like the competition, He might get a little jealous if we could <br>
make a little box as smart as He was from just a few parts we picked up at <br>
radio shack.<br>
