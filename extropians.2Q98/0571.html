 Tricky. I'm not good enough at physics to say for certain, but it<br>
 looks like a very complicated problem; you want to add together a lot<br>
 of dipoles (possibly time-varying) so that the induced current given<br>
 the electromagnetic properties of the head become large in only one<br>
 small area. It might be doable, but it would be a hack.<br>

IF it were to be possible...then would James Hogan's "Bug Park" also be<br>
possible?  AND are there any major obstacles or is it that noone has really<br>
bothered to try?<br>
