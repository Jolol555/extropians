<i>&gt; From: ChuckKuecker &lt;ckuecker@mcs.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;And don't forget the agnostics, who either say "we don't know" or  &gt;&gt;"we *cannot* know" when questioned about the supernaturals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The problem is that if you don't have any information about  &gt; &gt;something, it does not exist. We don't have any information about &gt; &gt;supernaturals -- all speculation is irrelevant &amp; leads to nothing.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From some public statements made by atheists around here, I would be  &gt; tempted to define atheism as a fervent belief in the NON existence of &gt; a supreme being...</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, atheism is (often) more than just saying "it's extremely<br>
unlikely that god exists", but also "it is not _desirable_ that god<br>
exists". It's about understanding that, certainly for a transhumanist,<br>
the existence of god is _not_ "neutral", but very, VERY bad. All our<br>
efforts would be futile. After all, don't we want to become gods<br>
ourselves? No such luck if the job has already been taken...(remember:<br>
if god existed he would _not_ be "nice", just look at this deathist<br>
planet and universe. Being omnipotent = being responsible for all that<br>
happens.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I shall continue as a quite vocal agnostic until I find sufficient &gt; evidence to change..</i><br>
<p>
And I shall continue as a quite vocal atheist until someone can present <br>
sufficient evidence of god's existence and/or that this would not be a<br>
disaster for humanity and transhumanists in particular.<br>
