Over the last several years I have become a big advocate for<br>
free-markets.  However, there has been some nagging questions that I<br>
have yet to answer without resorting to some form of socialism in order<br>
to solve.  Can any free-market advocate answer any and/or all of the<br>
following questions:<br>
<p>
<p>
1) Is there a single field which is intrinsically safe from automation<br>
in the course of the next 20-30 years?  If you can think of more fields,<br>
please elaborate.<br>
<p>
2) Are these remaining fields if any, sufficient to employ the majority<br>
of humanity?  If not, what will the rest of humanity do in order to<br>
survive?<br>
<p>
3)  For those who are unemployed and do not have sufficient investment<br>
income, is death the inevitable result?  If not, how will they survive?<br>
<p>
4) Will most people alive today be able to save enough before their jobs<br>
become automated?<br>
<p>
5) If how much money one has saved is the the key to surviving<br>
automation, does this not portend very badly for young people who have<br>
had less time to save for their forced retirement?  If this is true,<br>
does this mean that the future is going to be populated almost entirely<br>
of rich and old people and their children?<br>
