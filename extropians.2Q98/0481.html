Yes, above ground would be far less expensive, however, you are likely to endure<br>
never ending environmental impact headaches with the people whose property you<br>
buil don and beside.<br>
<p>
People are getting very proprietary about even the VIEW that they have from their<br>
property. In Vermont, for example, the just passed a law giving the local<br>
communities the right to approve the construction of communications towers on<br>
mountain tops (mostly for cellular phone use), something which the FCC is rather<br>
ambivalent about, as they really love the power they have been given by congress<br>
to have absolute power over permitting these towers.<br>
