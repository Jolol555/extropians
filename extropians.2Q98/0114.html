Hi Dan,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Hmm, can we please tell aparth between parlamentarian democracy and direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;democracy? -- I think that direct democracy is really the closest form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"spontaneous order" that we know. Democratic bureaucracies are a phaenomen</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the parlamentarian democracies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Except that they're not spontaneous.  Once your direct democracy has made a</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision, it has to force its operations on the minority who disapprove.</i><br>
<p>
Direct democracy is a main term: there are three kinds of direct democra- <br>
cy:<br>
<p>
- direct voting democracy<br>
- direct delegation democracy<br>
- direct consensus democracy<br>
<p>
Once the direct voting democracy have made a decision, it havn't to force  <br>
its operations on the minority who disapprove because the minority are  <br>
able to leave and to split the community.<br>
<p>
Once the direct delegation democracy have made a decision, it havn't to  <br>
force its operations on the minority who disapprove. The decision represen- <br>
ted a consensus/compromise among direct delegates (no consensus = no deci- <br>
sion). Each delegate had forwarded only the orginaly words of a group of  <br>
humans.<br>
<p>
Once the direct consensus democracy have made a decision, it havn't to  <br>
force its operations on the minority who disapprove because if there is a  <br>
disapproving minority than there isn't a consensus among all members and  <br>
therefore no decision.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, the great majority of market operations take place</i><br>
<i>&gt; because both parties</i><br>
<p>
Which parties? Political parties?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; them to take place, and thus they participate</i><br>
<i>&gt; volutarily.</i><br>
<p>
Does you really mean that hunger is a voluntary feeling?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To that extent, capitalism is much closer to "spontaneous</i><br>
<i>&gt; order" than democracy.</i><br>
<p>
Have you ever notices the "military" decision making procedures inside the  <br>
industrial companies? --<br>
<p>
Once the managment have made a decision, it have to force its operations  <br>
on the majority of workers. Therefore capitalism in its dayly reality  <br>
isn't much closer to "spontaneous order" than democracy.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Nico<br>
