&lt;&lt; I've seen a serious proposal for a system which could bring down an <br>
 entire 747 by parachute in a serious inflight emergency (or individual <br>
 pieces if the plane should partially break up in flight). The problem is <br>
 again cost and mass; AFAIR it requires fourteen large parachutes fitted <br>
 to various parts of the plane.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I seem to recall some time ago that one of the combat aircraft (?) was fitted<br>
with a system whereby the entire crew compartment ejected as a whole with<br>
built in parachutes...what would be the problem in having such a concept for<br>
commercial passenger aircraft?  That is: in the event of a "crash and burn"<br>
emergency the pilot could eject the passenger compartment.  It then descending<br>
on it's own automatically deployed chutes.  Since said compartment would be<br>
much lighter than the entire airframe  it would possible require less chutes.<br>
<p>
Of course...the redesign of the airframe might negate any saving.<br>
<p>
And the pilots might complain...but presumably they might be trained in the<br>
use of individual parachutes...or have a seperate system for the pilot<br>
compartment.<br>
<p>
Just speculation.<br>
