Soory it took so long to reply to this one, but I was making up HTML<br>
documents with images to explain the graphs better.  They're referenced in<br>
this e-mail.<br>

And if I bought the info from someone who had bought it from someone who<br>

removed from any crime that took place.  I'm also not bound by any<br>
contract to do anything for you; are you going to try to enforce terms on<br>
a contract I didn't sign?<br>
<p>
In addition, you get even worse problems when the merchant is also<br>
anonymous.  Suppose I post through anonymous remailers and a mail2news<br>
gateway that I have a copy of your manuscript available for anyone who<br>
sends me the price of a copy in anonymous cash.  I don't know to whom I'm<br>
selling, and they don't know from whom they are buying.  How are you going<br>
to prosecute me THEN? <br>

<i>&gt; IP law is merely a societal contract under which the government is delegated authority to enforce the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual contract rights of all of its citizens. It does not matter if the government is a monopoly state</i><br>
<i>&gt; or a competetive PPL. The principle is the same.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.  Normally I cannot enforce the terms on a contract upon<br>
someone with whom I have not contracted; only through special IP laws is<br>
this possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I read that, which was what got me started on this whole thread. You still treat patents as monopolies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while I treat them as competetive advantages in a competetive market. If you stop treating patents as</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopolies, then your argument goes away.</i><br>
<p>
I think on some level one must cede this definition, at least on the point<br>
that a copyright holder has a monopoly over copies of that particular<br>
piece of information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With electronic duplication and transmission, the costs are almost nil.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but it's that "almost" that would keep the market going, at much<br>
larger quantities than before, at a far far lower price.  Water is almost<br>
free, yet it sells regardless.  Since copies without IP laws are widgets,<br>
the analogy is apt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I can go buy the Red Hat CD and reproduce it if I want. I have a CDR deck on my PC here, and I can get</i><br>
<i>&gt; CD blanks for less than $2.00. Where is Red Hat gonna be when I can sell copies of their CD for 10% of what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they sell it for, or even 20%? I could offer it on my web site for free transmission.  Obviously Red Hat</i><br>
<i>&gt; has put some added value into their Linux offering, so how do they expect to recoup their investment if</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone can freely reproduce their product?</i><br>
<p>
Beats me, but they do it anyway, and people DO put it up on their<br>
web sites.  Trouble is, it's rather large; so large that it's often more<br>
efficient to earn $50 and buy a CD than it is to spend your time<br>
downloading Linux.  But nonetheless, it's available online, and yet the<br>
CDs still sell.<br>
<p>
Weird, isn't it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if it slowly advances, since there is no longer sufficient incentive for most people to invent, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have to worry about feeding their families first, invention will again become merely the province of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rich bachelors who can't get laid.</i><br>
<p>
Whenever the free market rations anything, it rations it to the rich and<br>
to the exceptionally devoted.  Fortunately for us, the exceptionally<br>
devoted are also in many ways the most productive.  So it's a trade off.<br>
At any rate, if we gain economic efficiency as a result of this trade off,<br>
it's a good thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Its actually rather simple, though tedious. Its merely a measure of growth of sales of products bearing</i><br>
<i>&gt; chinese patent numbers. Just as today's economic growth here in the US is almost entirely in the high tech</i><br>
<i>&gt; sector. Kill IP in the US and you will have economic stagnation here.</i><br>
<p>
I think you misunderstood my point.  Clearly, some of the decrease in<br>
invention came from the lack of IP, but I think you'd be hard pressed to<br>
argue that the planned economy had nothing to do with it.  I was asking<br>
how one would go about discovering what part of the lost patents were due<br>
to a planned economy and what part was due to a lack of IP. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, this is rather indicative, isn't it??? A lack of ability to forecast productivity increases due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological innovation seems to be a rather huge gaping hole in a model which claims to be so accurate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesnt' it? Of course, they only give average accuracy numbers. I'd like to see how the accuracy numbers</i><br>
<i>&gt; have changed over time. Even Greenspan has noted how current economic models have totally failed to predict</i><br>
<i>&gt; the present economy, which is almost entirely due to increased industrial productivity derived from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; high rate of technological advancement. I'll bet that the accuracy of the model is far less now than it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20 years ago. I note that it is also restricted to a forecasting ability of only 4 years.</i><br>
<p>
Economic forecasting is not entirely unlike weather forecasting to that<br>
extent.  However, fortunately for my argument, these are all macroecnomic<br>
forecasts, not microeconomic forecasts.  My argument from microeconomic<br>
efficiency is not affected by the failures of macroeconomic models.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How do you expect to demonstrate their relative sizes without knowing how large either shape is??? If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can do that its you that should get the nobel.</i><br>
<p>
The men who have done so have ALREADY won Nobel prizes; I stand upon the<br>
shoulders of giants when I follow their work.  As to how I can determine<br>
relative sizes without knowing the size of either shape, we use<br>
calculus and the supply and demand graph to tell us a lot about economic<br>
efficiency; for example, since monopolists represent the entire market,<br>
their marginal revenue curve decreases twice as fast as the demand curve.<br>
Since firms will produce up until the point where marginal revenue equals<br>
marginal cost, the quantity produced by a monopolist will be less than<br>
that produced in competition.<br>
<p>
Unclear?  I've made graphs.<br>
<a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/monop.html">http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/monop.html</a><br>
<p>
I've just demonstrated that the monopolist's quantity will be less than<br>
that produced in competition, despite the fact that I don't know how many<br>
would be produced in competition or how many the monopolist would produce,<br>
verifying my earlier claim that I could find relative sizes without<br>
knowing absolute sizes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SUch schemes are not currently used as the cost is currently greater than the cost of IP enforcement at</i><br>
<i>&gt; this time, due to the sufficiently widespread respect for IP protection. If this were to change, then such</i><br>
<i>&gt; schemes would then become cost effective. One such scheme takes advantage of passive boot sector virus/worm</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology to monitor tampering. If write attempts are made to specific hidden read only files, the virus</i><br>
<i>&gt; or worm built into the software will corrupt enough data to foil the tampering attempt, making the software</i><br>
<i>&gt; unusable.</i><br>
<p>
A priori, I cannot show that it would be cost effective to protect<br>
software in a secure way; I can do so using market numbers, however. <br>
According to the Software Publishers Association, "Few other industries<br>
lose as much revenue to theft, estimated at $13.2 billion; nearly 1 out of<br>
2 copies of software is illegally installed."* In light of this, I find it<br>
hard to believe that eliminating piracy would be unprofitable, even if it<br>
is thanks to piracy in other countries. <br>
<p>
On the contrary, the reason software companies don't use this particular<br>
scheme is that it wouldn't work:  Just set up a copier that emulates a<br>
computer, that records the program rather than executes it, and you've got<br>
a fully functioning warez machine.  Nintendo game copiers operate on<br>
precisely this principle; if you weren't aware, there is a thriving warez<br>
market for pirated Nintendo and Super Nintendo games, both of which come<br>
on ROM chips soldered into the game cartridges.  A "tamper-proof" <br>
cartridge would do you no good: All I have to do is read the game off of<br>
the cart, and I'm golden. <br>

<i>&gt; However, you can predict the change in incentive to invent, and determine the utility value of invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; for inventors. This gives you the invention supply curve.</i><br>
<p>
Beg your pardon?  By precisely how much will the incentive to invent<br>
change?  My argument has been qualitative, arguing that the incentive to<br>
invent would decrease, but not specifying absolutely by how much.  In<br>
order to find an actual supply curve, we'd have to know absolutely how<br>
much the incentive to invest would decrease.  How exactly do you propose<br>
to do that? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then correlating rates of patents being issued</i><br>
<i>&gt; with productivity growth in an economy, all other factors being equal, you can predict how change in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply of inventions will change the productivity growth.</i><br>
<p>
The whole point of my argument is that all other factors would NOT be<br>
equal: the market for copies would greatly expand if copyright were<br>
eliminated, and not having to pay for enforcement would lead to a<br>
non-trival income effect.  You can't just leave these out of your<br>
calculations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While I assert that current IP is merely a matter of monopoly government acting as a PPL in protecting the</i><br>
<i>&gt; IP licenses of its contracted (i.e. patents granted) citizens. If I were in a libertarian society, I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a free choice of PPL agencies to contract the protection of my IP with, and would only engage in IP</i><br>
<i>&gt; trade with indviduals that were customers of the same PPL or with competetive  PPL's with which my PPL had</i><br>
<i>&gt; IP agreements with.</i><br>
<p>
A PPA which tries to enforce contracts on those who have not agreed to<br>
their terms will probably not be economically efficient; similarly, it<br>
will be impossbile to catch your intended victims over the Internet when<br>
they are selling anonymously.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find it difficult to follow your charts due to the problems with lining up the characters. If you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce either graphics or excel compatible charts I would appreciate it. Feel free to send these via</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal email at retroman@together.net. In any event, I see something which you may not. If a competetive</i><br>
<i>&gt; business only has to lower its price half as much to increase its market share as a monopoly does to</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase the entire market, then obviously it is more efficient to have a monopoly provide a product. If it</i><br>
<i>&gt; wants to increase its market size it must lower its price twice as much than if it were a competetive</i><br>
<i>&gt; business. That tells me that the comsumers benefit twice as much from a monopoly than from a competetive</i><br>
<i>&gt; business. I for one don't beleive that.</i><br>
<p>
Do you still have misgivings after looking at the analysis on my web site?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If the inventor has to recoup his research, development, and production refinement costs and his</i><br>
<i>&gt; competetors do not, then he is at a competetive disadvantage to invent. Better to let some other schmuck</i><br>
<i>&gt; take those costs and steal his inventions from him. In such a situation, the incentive to invent will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative, and invention will stagnate.</i><br>
<p>
Again wrong.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when MARGINAL<br>
costs are higher, not when sunk costs are higher.  For an analysis of<br>
this, look at: <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html">http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html</a><br>
<p>
The cost of invention is sunk, which means that it doesn't change the<br>
shape of the supply curve.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when<br>
your supply curve is higher than the other guy's supply curve, so this is<br>
clearly not the case.  Instead, we see from the graphs that invention is<br>
only profitable if the increased revenues from invention outweigh the sunk<br>
cost of invention; this incentive is smaller than that under a monopoly,<br>
but not zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If it were so, then why are all of the economists totally flabbergasted at today's economy? None of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; models have predicted the huge increases in productivity which are what is driving our economic growth.</i><br>
<p>
MACRO, not micro.  Give me an example of where MICRO has failed us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If the person who bought my land from me signs my covenant, one clause in my covenant is that the buyer</i><br>
<i>&gt; must agree that anyone he sells the land to is bound by the same covenant. Thus while you cannot reproduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the land (except as seen below), you also cannot change the minimum terms of sale to your customers, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; their customers, etc. I can add additional terms, but the origianl terms cannot be recinded.</i><br>
<p>
True, but again, say you license to Alice who illegally sells a copy to<br>
Bob. Bob has broken the law, but now suppose he sells a copy to Carol.  Is<br>
Carol liable under the terms of a contract she's never signed?  Now what<br>
if she sells a copy to me?  As you can see, you quickly reach a point<br>
where it would be absurd to prosecute me under the terms of your contract:<br>
I've never seen it, have never agreed to it, and am not obligated to do<br>
anything to help you recover your loss; unless there are special IP laws<br>
which require me to do so.<br>
<p>
Similarly, if Alice sells me a copy anonymously over the Internet, and I<br>
start reselling it anonymously, how will you ever catch me?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While anonymous money may make a significant impact on electronic commerce, I don't think that anonymous</i><br>
<i>&gt; production of IP will make any significant headway.</i><br>
<p>
Not production, but RESELLING.  I expect you see the potential NOW.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, but they have contracts with their PPLs, and I have contracts with my PPL. Any reasonable PPL will</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognise the validity of a claim upon an individual who has received stolen goods, even if the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetrator cannot be found. As long as the stolen goods can be proven to posess a significant congruence</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the goods of the claimant which are documented prior to the receipt date of the stolen goods, then a</i><br>
<i>&gt; case and claim can be made.</i><br>
<p>
If I am correct about the economic efficiency of IP laws, then it is more<br>
economically efficient NOT to recognize such a claim than it is to do so:<br>
it would be costly to prosecute all of those people, espeically when they<br>
use cryptography, and it would also destroy a thriving copy market without<br>
adding enough to the incentive to invent to make this worthwhile.  And if<br>
Friedman is right about PPAs not enforcing economically inefficient laws,<br>
then PPAs won't hear such claims.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then you cede to the existing law. As IP law is prosecuted as civil offenses, rather than criminal offenses</i><br>
<i>&gt; (except when it involves transportation across state or national borders), you agree to most of current IP</i><br>
<i>&gt; law as practiced.</i><br>
<p>
Er, no: I don't agree that IP law should be enforced on resellers, but<br>
rather on those who broke the license in the first place; if this has<br>
happened at all, I have not heard of it. <br>
