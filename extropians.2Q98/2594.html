&lt;&lt;  ... 1) evil will never be overcome or 2) we should not overcome evil.<br>
 <br>
 	No reason?  I sure can't see any reason why you can think this<br>
 way.  How would we as sentient beings be any different from God?  If<br>
 God doesn't now overcome Evil, how/why should we ever be able to?  Why<br>
 could God be different than us?  If God doesn't have to overcome evil,<br>
 why should we now try to overcome evil?&gt;&gt;<br>
 <br>
Keep in mind that I don't necessarily believe any of the following reasons.<br>
I'm just showing how the reconciliation of God with evil does not necessarily<br>
lead to the above two conclusions.<br>
<p>
Reasons for thinking that 1 is not entailed by some reason R that reconciles<br>
God with evil:<br>
1) Evil will be overcome, but God has not chosen to do so yet, for reasons<br>
that are beyond us but that we should think exist because the existence of a<br>
benevolent God entails that they do.<br>
2) Evil will be overcome once all human beings finish living out their lives<br>
and making choices on earth (you could probably imagine all sorts of<br>
theologies to support such an idea).  Evil is currently necessary because the<br>
possibility of it must exist for free will to exist.<br>
3) Evil will be overcome once those who are evil see the error of their ways.<br>
Given that to be evil an agent must be capable of rational thought (ignoring<br>
for a moment the problem of how a rational agent can do evil), it seems<br>
plausible that over time all evil agents will see the irrational path they<br>
follow and become good, thus overcoming evil.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Reasons for thinking that 2 is not entailed by some reason R that reconciles<br>
God with evil:<br>
1) God does not overcome evil because he has voluntarily undertaken to somehow<br>
remove himself from this universe, in order to give the beings here, say,<br>
greater responsibility.  However, since we are here, and somehow can, we<br>
should overcome evil.<br>
2) God is the creator and source of ethical law, and above ethical law.<br>
Therefore the fact that we should overcome evil according to this ethical law<br>
does not mean that God should also overcome evil.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Now I certainly find many of those reasons as repugnant and implausible as you<br>
do.  But they show that a reconciliation of God with evil does not NECESSARILY<br>
lead to either 1 or 2.  And that was my point.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;&lt; A theodicy is an<br>
 attempt to twist evil or bad into good or into something that is<br>
 rationalized or justified.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I'd say that that's a particularly argumentative way of describing what a<br>
theodicy is.  If the presence of evil is truly justified, then it hasn't<br>
"twisted" anything in showing it to be justified.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt; 	Such an idea is the ultimate of devilishness to me.  How can<br>
 we find some way to twist bad into really being good so we can justify<br>
 it's existence or our (or God's) tolerance of it?  Again, I prefer to<br>
 hope that such would never be required, that we can find some way to<br>
 eliminate ALL evil.  Once we achieve such, as any God must already<br>
 have done, how could we be justified in not eliminating it?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Evil cannot of course be twisted into being good and still remain evil.<br>
That's simply incoherent.  But it seems plausible to me that there are moral<br>
restraints on actions that allow for the possibility and instantiation of<br>
evil.<br>
<p>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; 	Good is good and bad is bad in my book.  There can be no<br>
 twisting of one into the other.  I seek after and hope for perfect<br>
 goodness and make no attempts to justify any evil.  Any belief or<br>
 acceptance of any idea or words like "we must allow some evil" is<br>
 faithlessly giving up in despair to me.  My hope and desire is to<br>
 never give up until all evil is overcome.  It is not consistent to<br>
 have such a hope and to believe in a God.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
For reasons already mentioned, such a hope and desire is entirely compatible<br>
with belief in God.  Furthermore, if we have good reasons for accepting the<br>
notion that "we must allow some evil" then we would be irrational (perhaps<br>
evil?) not to accept it.<br>
 <br>
<p>
<p>
In any event, I do respect the degree of passion you have in opposition to<br>
evil and in devotion to optimisim.<br>
<p>
