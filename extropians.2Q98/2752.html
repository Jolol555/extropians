Do you disagree with the axiom that if an<br>
<i>&gt; ethical theory is true then it is right for</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone?  It seems self-evident to me.</i><br>
 It is simple: if an ethical theory is right,<br>
<i>&gt; then it is right for everyone.  Egoism is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; right for everyone by its own standards;</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore, when we presume egoism is right, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; must conclude that it is wrong.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think we're going in circles here.    For an ethical theory to be true it<br>
has to compared either to the "ends" or a "universal truth" - -<br>
<p>
In order for there to be a universal right or wrong, we'd have to ask if<br>
ethics can be derived from the laws of "nature" (18th Century Philosophy) or<br>
"god".   Then we could become natural talmudisists and begin implying  things.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if our ethical system is relative to our percpetion of the<br>
ends, then all ethical systems would be relative.    Obviously the ethical<br>
system of an egoist vs. altruist would be quite different.   The next question<br>
would be, which "value system" is ethical.   Now we're getting into<br>
existentialism...   As for "rationality", I think there are three forms of it<br>
- - <br>
<p>
One - - rationality as implied by an ethical system    (This presumes that<br>
what is right is rational and what is wrong is irrational.)<br>
Two - - rationality as defined by the means vs. ends   (This presumes that<br>
what works and leads to the "sum" is rational.)<br>
Three - - axiomatic rationality as defined by a system of universal truths<br>
(This presumes that the "answer" has already been given, and human logic has<br>
to conform to it, or be lead astray.)<br>
<p>
So in conclusion - - you have to qualify the term ethics or rationality by<br>
stating what's the goal of your system of ethics or rationality.    The other<br>
person may then respond by asking why.   If he does, that means there's an<br>
assumption that your system is part of a larger system (be it ethical, the<br>
laws of science, the universe, human nature, etc. etc.) and then you have to<br>
decide whether you wish to accept this presumption, and if so, justify your<br>
own system relative to that.   <br>
<p>
In conclusion, I really don't like the world ethics, because it is a loaded<br>
word with little meaning.   I prefer to qualify it with "ethical continuity" -<br>
- thieves and liars too have there own system of ethics.. hence implying, if<br>
they abide by it, they are "ethical".<br>
