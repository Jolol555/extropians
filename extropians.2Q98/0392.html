I don't think this discussion is closely related to extropianism, but let me<br>
try to turn it in that direction.<br>
<p>
I believe that most ancestors of pro-British residents of Northern Ireland<br>
moved there centuries ago, indeed longer ago than the arrival dates of most<br>
ancestors of current USA citizens.<br>
<p>
If some Choctaw were to point out to me, a fifth-generation Mississippian and<br>
eleventh-generation Southron, that his folks were forcibly dispossessed of the<br>
land beneath our feet and to say that jurisdiction therefore belongs to his<br>
tribe's government, would Brian say that I should accept?  Note that the<br>
Choctaws, one of the "Five Civilized Tribes", had a well-written constitution<br>
and a functioning government before the ethnic cleansing that opened<br>
Mississippi to my folks.<br>
<p>
The idea that jobs currently done by government employees should instead be<br>
done by private agencies chosen by each individual moves from idealism to<br>
practicality when one considers the bloodshed that results from insistence<br>
that every large geographic area should have a single sovereign power.<br>
<p>
I might prefer living under a modernized Choctaw government but would not<br>
acknowledge a nationalistic assertion of the Choctaw right to rule and would<br>
consider myself justified in resisting violently any violence employed by a<br>
hypothetical Choctaw Republican Army.<br>
<p>
Attempting to substitute voluntary, private arrangements for governments is<br>
preferable to pushing for rule by one government over another.  Failing that,<br>
I favor the cantonments promoted by Loew and Kendall's _South_Africa:_The_<br>
_Solution_.  By that standard, most governmental functions would devolve to<br>
smaller areas of Northern Ireland--counties perhaps--and cantonal plebiscites<br>
would determine whether London or Dublin would provide the few governmental<br>
services that hadn't been devolved.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;I see.  The IRA wants Northern Ireland partitioned into two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sections, with one section falling under their rule (and,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;presumably, passing to the Irish government) and another section</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;going in some other direction (presumably remaining British)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;according to the will of those persons (presumably mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Protestants) who live there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;No, I am not talking about "British Forces".  I am talking about </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;PEOPLE.  Bartenders, farmers, housewives.  Who happen to, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;various reasons, prefer British rule, or at least prefer *not* to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;suffer the fate that the IRA would choose for itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No you do not "see". there will be no further partioning of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind, the IRA will not be the government, the current republican</i><br>
<i>&gt; govt will control ALL of Ireland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The PEOPLE you refer to are descendants of those deliberately</i><br>
<i>&gt; settled onto Irish soil by the British Government, to enforce their</i><br>
<i>&gt; rule, not unlike the British invasion of Iceland in WW II, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; invaders every bit as much as the soldiers. Unlike the soldiers who</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not belong there, they would be free to remain, but under Irish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not British law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There will be no peace until this is so.</i><br>

Governments exploit patriotism by falsely identifying themselves with the<br>
lands that they claim to rule.  A patriot will oppose a government that<br>
oppresses his homeland.  One can be an anarcho-capitalist and love one's<br>
country, too.  -- AFB<br>
