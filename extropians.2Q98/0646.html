<i>&gt; &gt;Do you think that Van Gough was a 'rationally creative' mind?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think Van Gough was a creative painter. He was also mentally ill.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, there is some evidence that he suffered from Meniere's<br>
Disease--an inner ear disease that causes sudden "drop attacks" of<br>
severe vertigo complete with vomiting and sweats (which at the time<br>
were thought to be epileptic seizures), along with some hearing<br>
loss, tinnitus (Van Gogh described "screaming"--it's not clear<br>
whether he heard voices or just ringing) and balance problems.<br>
There are certainly times I might have cut my ear off if I could<br>
have stopped the constant noise.<br>
<p>
The disease most of the time goes away (mine has been in<br>
remission for a while now), but in those few cases where it<br>
progresses, it can become very disabling, and lead even a normal<br>
healthy mind to have problems coping.<br>
<p>
If he had had access to the tests and drugs I've had, he might<br>
have been a perfectly ordinary fellow like me--only a more<br>
talented artist.<br>
