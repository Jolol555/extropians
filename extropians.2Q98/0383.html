<i>&gt;I see.  The IRA wants Northern Ireland partitioned into two</i><br>
<i>&gt;sections, with one section falling under their rule (and,</i><br>
<i>&gt;presumably, passing to the Irish government) and another section</i><br>
<i>&gt;going in some other direction (presumably remaining British)</i><br>
<i>&gt;according to the will of those persons (presumably mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt;Protestants) who live there.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No, I am not talking about "British Forces".  I am talking about </i><br>
<i>&gt;PEOPLE.  Bartenders, farmers, housewives.  Who happen to, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;various reasons, prefer British rule, or at least prefer *not* to</i><br>
<i>&gt;suffer the fate that the IRA would choose for itself.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No you do not "see". there will be no further partioning of any<br>
kind, the IRA will not be the government, the current republican<br>
govt will control ALL of Ireland.<br>
<p>
The PEOPLE you refer to are descendants of those deliberately<br>
settled onto Irish soil by the British Government, to enforce their<br>
rule, not unlike the British invasion of Iceland in WW II, they are<br>
invaders every bit as much as the soldiers. Unlike the soldiers who<br>
do not belong there, they would be free to remain, but under Irish,<br>
not British law.<br>
<p>
There will be no peace until this is so.<br>
