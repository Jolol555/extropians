<p>
No, it doesn't.  Because your "larger" rulers are not larger than "self"<br>
within any reference frame; from BOTH reference frames the "larger" ruler<br>
is not positive; it is zero, because it is self.<br>
<p>
A cannot measure A to be non-zero.  B can, but B measures A to be smaller,<br>
not larger.  Similarly, B cannot measure B to be non-zero.  A can, but A<br>
measures B to be smaller.<br>
<p>
Larger is not the same as +.  Larger can be 0.  Unfortunately, summing<br>
negatives and zeroes does not get you back to zero, it just makes you more<br>
negative.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: This is what the charts say </i><br>

<i>&gt;              A  B</i><br>
<i>&gt;             ______</i><br>

<i>&gt;            --------</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    A: I stayed the same size to me, </i><br>
<i>&gt;    but I got larger relative to B.</i><br>
<p>
A did not get larger relative to B.  Ask B.  He'll tell you.  A got<br>
SMALLER.  That's what it means when you say "A gets larger relative to B:"<br>
B measures A to be larger.  B does NOT measure A to be larger, however. <br>
You keep falling back on this completely false presumption and claiming<br>
that you've answered my point already.  So long as you continue to insist<br>
that A is large relative to B, you make it clear that you have no clear<br>
grasp of the situation at hand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;When they get moving, B's meter stick looks to be 0.8m long.  So, you want</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to say A's meter stick is growing?  Relative to what?  Not B: B perceives</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A's meter stick to be SHRINKING, not growing.  What is A growing relative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: A is growing relative to B. You </i><br>
<i>&gt;    see, A observes B to be smaller, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;    has A gotten larger than B? The only </i><br>
<i>&gt;    way for A to know is look at B. If B </i><br>
<i>&gt;    is smaller, then A has gotten larger.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    This is because size is relative.</i><br>
<p>
When you say A has gotten larger, then that means that in some frame of<br>
reference, the A-0 partial difference is greater than before.  This isn't<br>
true, so this argument is unsound.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: From A's reference frame his ruler </i><br>
<i>&gt;    is as long as (actually) 2 of B's rulers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    if A's rulers is twice as long as B's.</i><br>
<p>
Here you're getting yourself confused.  A is 0 to A, because A does not<br>
use B's ruler.  *B* uses B's ruler.  When we make up these charts, we<br>
write down the partial difference between each relevant entity *as<br>
measured by one entitiy* on the row in question.  B's ruler is not used on<br>
A's row.  B's ruler is used on B's row.  See the difference? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: A sees B, A measures A relative </i><br>
<i>&gt;    to A's observation of B, A does NOT </i><br>
<i>&gt;    measure A relative to how B sees A. </i><br>
<p>
So now we're back to<br>
<p>
   A  B<br>
A  +  0<br>
B  0  +<br>
<p>
A measures itself in terms of B's ruler, and finds itself large.  Oops... <br>
Oh, wait, no.. that's not it, B measures A and finds A large.  Wait, no,<br>
that's flat out wrong.  B measures A and finds A SMALL compared to 0. <br>
What was it again?  *I* know!  A measures A in terms of ITSELF ONLY and<br>
gets 0, remember? This is why you have that diagonal line of zeros down<br>
all your identity charts.  A does not measure itself in terms of B until<br>
after we have written out the whole chart.  The individual values on the<br>
chart are PARTIAL differences, for which A uses only A's ruler, and not<br>
B's.  A will eventually find the NET identity in terms of A, B, C, etc.<br>
but the partial differences which are summed do not use multiple<br>
perspectives.  A measures A in terms of itself, and gets 0.  It measures B<br>
in terms of itself, and gets -C.  B does the same, getting 0 for itself<br>
and -C for A.  B does not create a partial difference of itself in terms<br>
of A; this only takes place when we sum the chart. <br>
<p>
A is larger than B only in A's perspective, but in A's perspective A is<br>
always 0.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    IAN: I've now answered this about 15x now.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and wrongly every time, which is why I continue to press the point.<br>
A is not large according to A: A is 0 relative to A.  You cannot say that<br>
A is larger than 0 according to either A or B.  Therefore, any chart you<br>
propose which had a positive sign in it is necessarily flawed: A never<br>
grows relative to anything, it DOES shrink relative to B.  This special<br>
case violates your principles, which is why I propose it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    The implicit phrasing of the charts is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;    little confusing. But this is cleared up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    As we can see, if A appears larger than</i><br>
<i>&gt;    B, then A is said to be larger than B.</i><br>
<p>
Nice use of the passive voice.  A says that it is larger than B, but only<br>
in that A is 0 and B is negative.  B says the same thing about A.  So<br>
nobody claims to observe any positive numbers at all: A is 0 to A and<br>
negative to B, B is 0 to B and negative to A.  No positive numbers means<br>
no way to add back up to zero.<br>
<p>
Now, try this again, and this time remember that just because A is larger<br>
than B according to itself does NOT make it positive in its own<br>
reference frame, and that it is NEGATIVE is B's reference frame.<br>
