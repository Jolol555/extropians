In the context of anarcho-capitalism it's very possible to give<br>
hardware and software individual status, if they can operate in the<br>
market they can be self-supportive (sovereign status for vending<br>
machines, and people say anarcho-capitalists are cold hearted!).  A<br>
basic definition of an "individual" in the market is any<br>
self-sufficient entity.  In the near future it will be possible to<br>
replace limbs, organs, etc. with artificial or augmented versions. <br>
Around this time technological progress is likely to be getting fast<br>
and your average capitalist will be busy with her bank statement.  So<br>
why not hand over control to the market?  Limbs and organs offer a<br>
service, through micro billing (or perhaps a pre-decided quota based<br>
on performance and use) you could pay them for this service, when a<br>
limb feels the need to upgrade itself it will at it's own cost.  Your<br>
limbs, organs, and perhaps even parts of your brain could become<br>
self-sufficient market entities.<br>
