<i>&gt; &gt; The main problem for me is not such interpretation, just because I suppose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they did not even know Everest... And the greater mountain for them was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possibly Sinai...They were, in general, an ignorant people, with almost no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; great commerce or knowledge of the rest of the world... They were weak, lots</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of times were taken as slaves... Just after, at the time of Solomon or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; David, they got a little more importance... Their main difference  was the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; religiousty with a monotheist image of the supposed god was of a Good</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Father... This made them different from Greek ( = Roman ) Theology... And,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; talking about good things and look: ressurrection... they "made the minds"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of other people... ( Note that Christians were nothing more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; revolutionary ( in the philosophical sense... ) Neo-Jews, for that time... )  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;That's not the worst of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;It rained so much as to cover the mountain (and don't forget that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;fountains of the earth opened up to help out).  That would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Everest, which according to my almanac (I found the damn thing </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;again) is 29,028 feet above sea level.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;It did this in only 40 days and 40 nights = 960 hours.  The water </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;level rose at an average of 363 inches per hour.  Even if only 10% of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;that is rain (the rest being from the fountains of the earth), that's </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;a yard of rain an hour.  A heavy Midwestern rainstorm delivers maybe </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;four inches an hour.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;With a yard of rain an hour, Noah didn't need an ark.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;He needed a submarine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;an ark.</i><br>
                 ^---now what's that line doing there?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do we know with out a doubt where all this was taking place, was it </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the gaza strip?</i><br>
<p>
It was over the entire earth.<br>
<p>
After all, that's what the Bible says.<br>
<p>
And the Bible is the unalterable incorruptible Word of God, right?<br>
<p>
(Excuse me a moment.....   GAGGH.... thanks, I'm back and I feel <br>
better.)<br>
