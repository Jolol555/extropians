Growing up with an IQ of 160 was freakish enough for me. I can't imagine the<br>
sort of punishment a kid would go through in childhood and teen years in a<br>
state of non-standard, or non-determinate sexuality. If I were such a kid I<br>
think that the best thing that could happen to me would be that someone would<br>
have taken care of if before I could even remember anything and never tell me<br>
anything about it.<br>
