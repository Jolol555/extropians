"Extension of Drosophilia Lifespan by Overexpression of Human SOD1 in<br>
Motorneurons"<br>
Nature Genetics 19: 171-174 June 1988<br>
<p>
Abstract:<br>
<p>
   Reactive oxygen (RO) has been identified as an important effector in<br>
ageing and lifespan determination. The specific cell types, however, in<br>
which oxidative damage acts to limit lifespan of the whole organism have<br>
not been explicitly identified. The association between mutations in the<br>
gene encoding the oxygen radical metabolizing enzyme CuZn superoxide<br>
dismutase (SOD1) and loss of motorneurons in the brain and spinal cord that<br>
occurs in the life-shortening paralytic disease, Familial Amyotrophic<br>
Lateral Sclerosis (FALS), suggests that chronic and unrepaired oxidative<br>
damage occuring specifically in motor neurons could be a critical factor in<br>
ageing. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenetic Drosophilia<br>
which express human SOD1 specifically in adult motorneurons. We show that<br>
overexpression of a single gene, SOD1, in a single cell type, the<br>
motorneuron, extends normal lifespan by up to 40% and rescues the lifespan<br>
of a short-lived Sod null mutant. Elevated resistance to oxidative stress<br>
suggests that the lifespan extension observed in these flies is due to<br>
enhanced RO metabolism. These results show that SOD activity in<br>
motorneurons is an important factor in ageing and lifespan determination in<br>
Drosophilia.<br>
