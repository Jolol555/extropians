<i>&gt; From: Anton Sherwood &lt;dasher@netcom.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Dan Fabulich &lt;daniel.fabulich@yale.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And why wouldn't this sentimentality be at least as effective in keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt; smaller, commercially competitive forces in check, as it was in keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt; (say) the KGB honest?</i><br>
<p>
Because these smaller forces will probably be more like mercenary armies, and<br>
these have less inhibitations when it comes to molesting the populace. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; den Otter, your state has a military, yes?  What's going to stop it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; squishing your exquisite statecraft, cutting out the electronic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; surveillance (at least on themselves) and surpressing the masses?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes, my system would have a military, but this would not be the only armed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; force in the empire. There would have to be several, to provide the necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; balance. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But all ultimately under the same command, unlike PPAs.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the system relies heavily on the competence and benevolence of<br>
the leader (but of course he'll be elliminated by someone if he does too<br>
outrageous things, so that's a safety). However, the president or <br>
emperor or whatever you want to call this guy would have been selected<br>
for competence, stability and basically a lack of thirst for power. You<br>
want someone who does his duty but doesn't enjoy it _too_ much. <br>
Some people on the list, like Anders for example, might qualify<br>
(I think) ;-)<br>
<p>
The system is more or less a constitutional monarchy, but not a hereditary <br>
one. If it works you have a new age of enlightenment, if it fails...well, you<br>
can always try anarcho-capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; We have minimum wage because if you would go much lower people would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; starving.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who would accept a wage that doesn't pay for the food to supply enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy to go to work??</i><br>
<p>
That's the way it often was in ye olde days (still in this century, mind you),<br>
and that's the way it *still* is in many 3rd world and even not-so-3rd-world<br>
countries around the globe. Many people simply don't have a choice<br>
(or at least they firmly belief that they don't have a choice) and those who<br>
can't add to their insufficient income by such things as begging, stealing<br>
&amp; hustling will ultimately get too weak to work and die.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; You can't legislate a living wage.  You can only forbid people to accept</i><br>
<i>&gt; a wage that you think is too low.  How on earth does that benefit them? </i><br>
<i>&gt; How is it better to have NO wages than to be working for less than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; average politician would accept?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, it's not that bad: minimum wage means that corporations, shops etc.<br>
with a (high profile) reputation to hold up will pay more than they would other-<br>
wise to their workers (think Mc Donalds and such), and that those who are<br>
willing to work for less can still sneak into a sweatshop or some other kind<br>
of "illegal" work. Otherwise, more people would be badly paid then today;<br>
companies need a minimal x amount of workers, and minimum wage is the<br>
difference between 10 reasonably paid workers or 30 badly underpaid workers.<br>
So those who *do* have a legit job benefit directly, and those who don't can<br>
still find (illegal) work anyway. <br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Indeed, automation can make prizes drop, but if stuff gets so cheap you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sell it for virtually nothing, then why not give it away for free all the same?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, why not?  The necessities of life may well be given away as</i><br>
<i>&gt; advertising.  But let's not tear down a very functional system (trade)</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the chance that such might happen, hm?</i><br>
<p>
In a system with practically-for-free production of certain kinds of food and<br>
other basic stuff that's then handed out for free or extremely little there<br>
still can be free trade in anything you want. The only difference is that<br>
since you can't outcompete the gov in the "basics" sector, you'd have<br>
to focus on "luxury goods" (anything else) to make of profit. There isn't<br>
a real *monopoly* on the "basics", it's just that there is no money to<br>
be made anymore in this field. The food factories etc. could even be<br>
maintained with revenues from national (state) lotteries and such, so<br>
that people aren't taxed for the benefit of others. This is a very market-<br>
oriented state I have in mind...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Besides,  a lot of people would otherwise simply have to beg to get even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those couple of bucks in a highly automated world, because virtually no-one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would want unreliable and inefficient people working for them if they can get</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a cheap, trustworthy and super-efficient robot.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Assuming robots can supply ALL services ...</i><br>
<p>
Sooner or later, they will. If you'd push full speed ahead you could probably <br>
elliminate the vast majority of "dumb" jobs within one or two decades. Why<br>
get rid of these job opportunities? Because machines, when properly<br>
programmed, are a lot more reliable, cheaper  and generally user-friendly<br>
than people. Right now too much of our infrastructure depends on <br>
dimwits with red tendencies. I'd rather have them at home, well-fed<br>
and having fun with VR.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Uhm... how do you measure the quality of a psychological profiler?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; By the number of screw-ups he makes (how many people that were deemed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "OK" by him turned out to be inadequate ?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay, and who gets to decide which politicians are "inadequate"?</i><br>
<p>
There are no more politicians in the usual sense. There's just the emperor<br>
(well, let's call him that for the moment), the supreme court and various<br>
other controlling organs. Yes, there could be parlaiment or some other<br>
gathering of the people's represetatives, but I'd prefer direct electronic<br>
voting (referendum) on important issues. The outcome isn't binding, but <br>
a smart ruler won't go against the people's wishes *too* often.<br>
<p>
The adequacy test is meant for government employees (especially in<br>
important functions) and whether or not someone is inadequate can<br>
be determined in exactly the same way as is done in corporations<br>
etc. The new state is largely designed as a company, but one with<br>
certain ideological motives.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Oy vey.  If anarcho-capitalism depends on everybody's goodwill, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; what?  If that's a serious flaw then we're in deep trouble, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; DAILY LIFE IN ANY SYSTEM depends on everybody's goodwill to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; degree.  Every single person in several counties is betting that I (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rest of our neighbors) won't steal a car tonight and go burn their</i><br>
<i>&gt; house down.</i><br>
<p>
Oh really, well I guess we don't need the police then. Or PPAs for that<br>
matter. Hey, all's cool if you can trust your fellow man. Needless to say,<br>
it ain't so, we *don't* trust eachother and have good reason for it too.<br>
The state is a product of the fact that on one hand we need a lot of<br>
co-operation to thrive, while at the other hand we don't trust eachother<br>
very much. The state is the context wherein civilization can exist.<br>
PPAs are basically just small, weak states, and will therefore have<br>
more limited means to uphold law and order (not to mention a <br>
pleasant environment). <br>
<p>
You can't compare any present security agency to a PPA btw, because<br>
they play on a field that's maintained by the nation state. Once they<br>
(and/or their customers) have no longer Big Brother to fall back on in<br>
times of trouble, they might be in for a really hard time. You only realise<br>
something's importance when it's gone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Where power is dispersed, no one person is much of a threat, and there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are balances to every plausible threat.  Where power is concentrated,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the opposite is true.</i><br>
<p>
In reality, no state on earth has enough power to just do anything with<br>
its people, and the politicians know it. As long as you need them for<br>
maintaining the system you can't just kill them. Only a Power is<br>
fully independent (and that's why it is likely that humanity is finished<br>
when we reach that stage).<br>
<p>
Also, in anarchy there *may* be a better balance of power, so the chances<br>
that a _big_ dictator kills you may be smaller, but the chances that a<br>
"local" one will do it, or just any guy with a gun, are far greater. In any<br>
case, anarchy inevitably leads to structure, and structure leads to<br>
centralism. Why not skip the decades or centuries of little wars and<br>
annexations and go right to the final product?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Or by taking power away from the politicians; private parties, spending</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own money, have no reason to take bribes.</i><br>
<p>
Wherever there's an organized structure of some kind and capitalism, there will <br>
be bribes.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sure, but if you like it, it probably wasn't crap in the first place. I meant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; *real* crap, like food so full of conservatives that you'll develop cancer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over time, or a television set with lousy sound etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are civil remedies for such things.  Political control over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; market cannot prevent them; it can only ensure that they happen more</i><br>
<i>&gt; often.</i><br>
<p>
Civil remedies still depend on a government to enforce them. Besides,<br>
"political control over the market" doesn't have to the communist kind<br>
of meddling, it can simply mean that useful new products may get some<br>
extra help, and that there's a state-sanctioned "seal of quality" so that<br>
you know what products meet minimum standards, or are outright good,<br>
at a single glance. Products don't *have* to have this seal (and the testing<br>
that comes with it), but buying them is at your own risk of course, while<br>
products backed by the state entitle you to damages &amp; refunds etc, in<br>
case of a failure. The damages etc. are split between state (and have<br>
financial repercussions for the responsible government workers) and<br>
the producer of the goods. This way, everybody is motivated to deliver<br>
a quality service. Of course today's "lawyerculture" would have to be<br>
pruned back, no more damages 'cause you slipped over a coke bottle<br>
in your own home or something silly like that. It has to be *real* damage,<br>
and frauds will be prosecuted to the full extend of the law -- and beyond ;-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'm quite sure your PPAs would either</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be a minority from the start (the rest being totalitarian clans, citystates</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;full- blown countries)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not if it takes place through a slow period of privitization.</i><br>
<p>
Somewhere there must be a breaking point where politicians are no<br>
longer in control. Yes, it could work out OK, but it will be quite hard<br>
to dismantle such a venerable tradition. And what will happen to<br>
all the former gov employees, who will get the army hardware, the<br>
_nukes_ etc. Who will get the White House? Bill Gates? Does he<br>
buy the nukes too (wholesale style), and a couple o' carriers too<br>
when he's at it? Of course he would have to share with some other<br>
wealthy folks, and maybe he would be poor by then, but in any case<br>
I can well imagine a Russian scenario where former politicians and<br>
bureaucrats sneak back under different "names" into the positions<br>
of power, packed with cash made from the privatization process.<br>
Also I can imagine all sorts of mafia types having a ball, no longer<br>
hampered by even token government intervention. What is stopping<br>
them from creating a new order under a different name and sucking<br>
the people dry in only slightly different ways. Will the raw intellect<br>
and bold dedication of Jack the Lad be able to stop them? Uh oh...<br>
<p>
And then there's the problem that the transition from governments to<br>
a free market world can never happen all over at the same time. Some<br>
areas will simply be left out, and without western backing any hint<br>
of fair rule will quickly fade from the less developed countries all over<br>
the world. Their dictators will be quite interested in all the formerly<br>
classified hardware and expertise that suddenly hits the market.<br>
Saddam: "bring on the nukes! I have oil, you have weapons and<br>
people to operate them -- we trade". Ok, business is business.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Indeed, the transition is a delicate period.  Best to disarm the</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians NOW so they won't be tempted.  ;)</i><br>
<p>
Oh, I fully agree! :-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; But I'll take a risky transition to anarchy in preference to the nice</i><br>
<i>&gt; orderly march toward slavery that we're on now.</i><br>
<p>
Slavery? Isn't that overstating it a bit? Oh, by the way (although you might<br>
have thought otherwise when reading my anti-anarchy rantings) I *welcome*<br>
anarchy. I see chaos as a challenge, a job opportunity if you will. It's the<br>
other people that have a problem...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; What if we buy off the politicians?  Tell them:  "You deserve to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; taken out and shot, but that's a lot of trouble, so instead we're going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to give you all the gold you can carry, and a one-way ticket to any</i><br>
<i>&gt; other continent."</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, what continent would that be? And guess who its new rulers would<br>
be? Besides, we *will* buy them out, in a way, like the Russian people did<br>
with their politicians (only, those stayed of course).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They may not really like it, but looking through history that appears to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the way things sooner or later turn out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And one could equally well say, looking through history, that sooner or</i><br>
<i>&gt; later people get richer and more free.  Every cycle has a top and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bottom.  All we can hope for, I suppose, is to make the top come sooner</i><br>
<i>&gt; and last longer.</i><br>
<p>
We don't have much time, so better make this a quick one. And watch out<br>
for those nukes!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Around here, I often see stickers on shop windows saying "protected by</i><br>
<i>&gt; XYZ Security" - some private firm which, when it hears an alarm, sends a</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple of goons.  And it's not the same firm whose sticker is on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; shop next door.  It helps if such firms are friendly with each other,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but they obviously needn't have all the business in town.  </i><br>
<p>
There is a major difference between present-day security firms and PPAs,<br>
since the former work within the framework that's maintained by the<br>
state, and the latter *are* the state. The main reason why you can have<br>
competing security firms working in relative harmony on the same turf<br>
is because they would get busted by Big Brother if they tried to "take"<br>
a region by force, and kicked out the competition. With BB gone, it's<br>
a whole new ballgame. It's not unlikely that criminal organizations, no<br>
longer able to profit from illegal drug trade after the state's demise,<br>
would be among the first PPAs. A couple of gangs, or devisions of the<br>
same gang, could devide a city and treat the people in it more like<br>
slaves than as customers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why would they [the military] suddenly become less ethical if they shared the </i><br>
<i>&gt; business with other firms?</i><br>
<p>
Because the military as we know it would be gone in anarcho-capitalism (who's<br>
going to pay for a huge standing army that offers no direct protection), and the<br>
new PPA enforcers would generally be of a different breed than the patriotic<br>
young men in the regular army. I'm not saying that *all* PPAs would have to<br>
turn bad, but I do think that large areas (especially in regions where democracy<br>
either never existed or doesn't have a strong tradition) would be lost to gangs<br>
of thugs that don't even bother to keep up the appearance of "company".<br>
<p>
This means that most 3rd world countries, the eastern block, arabic countries<br>
and some regions of western countries would (re)lapse into totalitarianism. Some<br>
of these new nation states or bands of thugs would probably get big enough,<br>
and crazy enough, to be a threat to the areas controlled by bonafide PPAs.<br>
The most logical reaction by the PPAs would be to consolidate their area<br>
before it falls to religious fundamentalism or whatever, meaning that they<br>
would start to behave like a real state, complete with their own turf and <br>
probably taxes etc. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Greater size usually means greater stability. To give an example, streetgangs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fight all the time, while big governments only fight sporadically, and since the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; advent of nukes the major ones even don't fight at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How silly of the Afghans not to recognize the advantages of size and</i><br>
<i>&gt; stability.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the Afghans are an extremely silly people, aren't they. And ironically,<br>
they support my case a lot better than yours: when the centralist communists<br>
ruled the region life was, in the cities at least, a lot better than it is now.<br>
As soon as the regime fell the bands of thugs that fought it turned on eachother<br>
and on the population, and after some very destructive fighting the meanest<br>
of them all, the gang of religious psychos known as Taliban (or something like <br>
that) has established a regime that makes the communists look *really* good...<br>
If *this* is the shape of things to come, I'd rather be centralized. [Or maybe not,<br>
I like to live on the edge ;-) ]<br>
<p>
Oh, by the way: the communist regime was in fact quite stable, and held out much<br>
longer than anyone had expected after the Russians left and cut all aid to the<br>
regime.<br>
The savages (or "freedom fighters" if you will) on the other hand remained quite<br>
well-funded by all kinds of other states, and still had a hard time taking Kabul.<br>
I guess the somewhat more civilized cityfolk were more affraid of them then they<br>
were of their own rulers...and they were right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, their conscience (that of the regular soldier) is stopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them from turning on their own people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do people lose their conscience when they work in the private sector?</i><br>
<p>
Some certainly do, and often it's a different kind of people that is attracted<br>
to PPA work. I would expect a greater number of "brown shirts" (bullies<br>
that are only tough enough to terrorize unarmed or badly armed people) in the<br>
PPA business, while the army is more about patriotism, courage and honor.<br>
(at least they *try* to keep up this image).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; A few years ago, Marines at Twentynine Palms (don't ask me why "marines"</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a base in the Mojave Desert) were given a notorious questionnaire</i><br>
<i>&gt; about their willingness to fire on Americans to enforce some chickenshit</i><br>
<i>&gt; law.  About one in three (iirc) said yes.  They're the ones who will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; chosen as "reliable" when the shit hits the fan.</i><br>
<p>
If it hits the fan so hard that these folks are really required, civilization has<br>
probably gone down the drain anyway. Besides, if someone is "tough"<br>
(or scared) enough to answer "yes" to such a question, this doesn't<br>
automatically mean that he will really do it.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; A few months ago, a boy about 17 was herding goats one evening on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rio Grande (border with Mexico), and shot at something.  We'll never</i><br>
<i>&gt; know why he fired (rabbit? coyote?), because four Marines sneaking about</i><br>
<i>&gt; - looking for drug smugglers - assumed he was firing at them, stalked</i><br>
<i>&gt; him for twenty minutes (during which he apparently was oblivious to</i><br>
<i>&gt; them) and killed him.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know what really went down there, of course, but people have always<br>
been somewhat more trigger happy when the target is of a different ethnic<br>
background, and of course assholes can be found in any organization.<br>
The same guys could just as well 've been working for a local PPA. If a<br>
client complaints about mexicans in his neighborhood the PPA people<br>
will probably shoot them just as easy as any Marine would. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In my system you could add to that mutual surveillance (the people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; spy back, and, for what it's worth, they have guns).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And what do they use their guns for?  Clearly not to discipline corrupt</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians; that would be anarchy!</i><br>
<p>
The *threat* of anarchy should be enough to keep the politicians in check.<br>
In most cases, neither the government nor the people really want things<br>
to get out of control, especially in a wealthy state. So they'll both compromise<br>
a bit for their own benefit.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In a more advanced stage of automation the key to avoid tirrany</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is spreading control over the enforcer robots over rivalizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; institutions (that are unlike PPs part of the same system, more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; like different immune systems in one body than seperate bodies).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Could you tell us more about how these rival institutions are not like</i><br>
<i>&gt; private protection agencies?</i><br>
<p>
PPAs are not under the same command, the rival institutions *are*. The<br>
head(s) of state is/are like a referee in a football match. Also, these<br>
institutions aren't generally into contract-based personal security services,<br>
but rather take care of more general threats and provide the basic<br>
framework of stability in which private security companies can operate<br>
(and can focus on their job instead of "playing state").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Something like it is common in "primitive" societies; indeed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of "primitive society" seems to be "stateless society".</i><br>
<p>
Yes, makes you think, doesn't it? Maybe it just doesn't work for more<br>
advanced societies (or at least it seems that centralization plays<br>
a crucial role in the development of modern nations). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Iceland relied entirely on private enforcement for centuries, and was</i><br>
<i>&gt; generally peaceful.  (The sagas, which concentrate on violence, tell of</i><br>
<i>&gt; years going by between events in the bitterest feuds.)</i><br>
<p>
But will it work for a technologically advanced society? I'd hate to see<br>
a return to hunter-gatherer communities or something like that...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, every peasant can afford a weapon that would make short work of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; medieval knight, and weapons that can kill tanks and helicopters are</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the reach (fiscal if not legal) of most of us.  If the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; continues to bow down to central authorities, it's partly out of habit.</i><br>
<p>
Well, old habits die hard...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Where the central authorities are relatively benign, they will probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; last longer; where they are recognized openly as tyrants and thieves,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they will soon be gone, as already in Northern Somaliland.</i><br>
<p>
And have things actually gotten better since then?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Apparently the system is doing fine even without hew laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I sure don't see any coup d'etats in the USA...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then you haven't heard about how the politicians have taken to wiping</i><br>
<i>&gt; their backsides with the Bill of Rights?  We don't need coups d'etat, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have tyranny coming in the front door in the name of "national security"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "protecting our children" and "preventing terrorism" and all that</i><br>
<i>&gt; baloney.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed, most of that is pure crap, but at least you can still openly say so<br>
without risking jail or worse ;-) Needless to say, I would get rid of unnecessary<br>
bureaucracy if I could, few people hate it more than myself.<br>
 <br>

I guess they were looking for terrorists then...or maybe even worse: potheads!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And yes, a system of checks and balances could reduce any such risk</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; even further (in fact, that's pretty much what you have with all your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; special branches, secret services, police forces etc.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It seems to work OK.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Except for its victims.</i><br>
<p>
There are several things to say to that: first, the number of "real" victims is <br>
relatively limited, and would probably be a lot higher in a world without <br>
a stable central government. Also, many of the casualties are due to the<br>
unholy war on victimless "crime". There is no such thing in my proposed<br>
plan; do what you like as long as you don't damage others without their<br>
consent and all that. Probably the most casualties are due to war. I<br>
would always seek to prevent war, and if this isn't possible use robot<br>
weapons and small groups of professional soldiers. No-one should be forced <br>
to risk death for his country (and machines make better soldiers anyway).<br>
