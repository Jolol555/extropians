Hi.<br>
<p>
I had an idea for long-range (6000+ miles) laser communication system using<br>
(more or less) off the shelf technologies.  I am unable to find any obvious<br>
flaw in my idea, so I was hoping for some feedback from people who may be<br>
more knowledgeable about this than I.<br>
<p>
<p>
Laser targeting/ranging systems, such as those used by the military, mark<br>
their targets by detecting the laser light which is reflected off the<br>
object being illuminated.  My idea was to use objects in geosynchronous<br>
orbit as reflective bodies for the purpose of scattering laser light.  The<br>
ground stations would use laser pulses to send data by reflecting them off<br>
the geosynchronous object.  A passive sensor on the receiving end would<br>
detect the laser light that scatters off the satellite and (hopefully)<br>
discern the bits.  In the simplest case scenario, the data communication<br>
would be half-duplex, but more complex arrangements could be developed.  I<br>
am unsure of the type of baud rate that could be accomplished this way.<br>
<p>
If this worked, it would be an interesting option for<br>
covert/subversive/etc. communications.  Lock onto your satellite of choice<br>
and send the data.  Encryption would be necessary, but it would probably be<br>
difficult to locate the sender, especially if the laser didn't operate at<br>
visible wavelengths.  The problem I see is the possibility that you<br>
wouldn't get a good scatter off the satellite.  I know that the<br>
ground-laser-to-geosync works because my mother used to work in a building<br>
where data was transmitted that way, but I am unsure how the downlink worked.<br>
<p>
Comments?<br>
