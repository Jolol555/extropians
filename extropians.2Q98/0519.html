<i>&gt; From:          "Tony B. Csoka" &lt;csoka@itsa.ucsf.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I agree that parachutes are impractical in most scenarios. I just</i><br>
<i>&gt; find it hard to forget the fact that 150+ people had 1/2 hr. to  bail</i><br>
<i>&gt; out in the crash I saw on TV. I mean, the plane hit the ground at 200+</i><br>
<i>&gt; mph !! I like your idea of a foaming system.</i><br>
<p>
Let's rephrase this: 150+ people, two of whom had ever before seen a <br>
parachute in real life, had 1/2 hr to bail out of an aircraft that <br>
was moving far faster than airplanes are normally moving when <br>
parachutists jump out of them.<br>
<p>
(Me, I don't see the point in jumping out of a perfectly good <br>
airplane.  I also don't want to get into a boat that the commander <br>
intends to sink.  So I'll never, in non-emergency situations, be a <br>
parachutist or a submariner.)<br>
