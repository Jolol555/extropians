An important point which I should have made earlier is how often and to<br>

jeopardize your own; the point where it becomes unprofitable to do is<br>
difficult to identify.  Nonetheless, even if we restrict the egoist to<br>
only hurting people for profit if/when he could get away with it without<br>
being discovered, we would still generally be worse off, IMO. <br>
