These Molecules Are Real Self-Starters<br>
<p>
For engineers, it's close to playing god. They are devising so-called self-assembly<br>
techniques aimed at getting molecules to arrange themselves into larger functioning<br>
systems, much as eggs and sperm self-assemble into human beings. Until now, only<br>
nature has been able to get more that a few molecules to join together, into very small<br>
nanostructures. But on March 20, two University of Rochester researchers said they <br>
had developed the largest synthetic structures ever made by self-assembly.<br>
<p>
Though each structure contains millions of molecules, the largest is only 50 microns<br>
long, less than the width of a human hair. Still, that's 1,000 times larger that the <br>
previous record for synthetic self-assembled structures, the researchers report in<br>
the journal Science. "In the world of self-assembly, these structures are giant," says <br>
X. linda Chen, one of the researchers and a graduate engineering student at <br>
Rochester. Chen and engineering professor Samson A. Jenekhe started with a<br>
large polymer macromolecule long thought too unstable for self-assembly. They<br>
tamed the polymer by inserting hydrogen bonds into the structures, the same <br>
stabilizers found in DNA and other natural self-assebled proteins.<br>
<p>
The molecules form a variety of shapes, including spheres, cylinders, rings, and disks-<br>
all of which have a fluorescent glow. The researchers say the structures could be <br>
utilized as drug-delivery vehicles, adhesives, lasers, sensors, and for other industrial<br>
applications.<br>

Has anyone read the actual Article in Science?<br>
