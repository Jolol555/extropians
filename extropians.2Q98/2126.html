<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       I give a _physical_ explanation of Heisenberg's Uncertainty</i><br>
<i>&gt;       principle, whereby I expressly demarcate the _physics_ of</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Heisenberg's ideas from the observationalist/positivist religion:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    &gt;All this [ Heisenberg's] 'observationalist' stuff is positivist old</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    &gt;hat and can be demolished quite readily. We can _retrodictively</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    &gt;correct_ the observation results.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     My assertion that we can retrodictively correct the 'observational'</i><br>
<i>&gt;     'evidence' to the extent that we understand the underlying processes</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and interactions is simply _true_ (we do it all the time), and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;     cannot understand why John Clark should fail to grasp the point,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     unless he doesn't _want_ to understand it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No you can not, not readily and not at all</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        &gt;&gt;Planck's constant is constant</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        &gt;Wake up man --  it's a ratio!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Could you please explain why a ratio can not be a constant.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        I was hoping to get Christian to see the difference between a ratio</i><br>
<i>&gt;        and an (alleged) Absolute property.  SR/GR simultaneously states</i><br>
<i>&gt;        that there are no absolute properties, then tries to sneak in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Absolute velocity of light.  It just doesn't work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     &gt;Not [the speed of light is constant] according to Richard Feynman</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     &gt;in Quantum Electrodynamics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Dead wrong, Richard Feynman never said anything that stupid in his life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       I have a hundred dollars that says that I can give you citation for</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Feynman's saying exactly this, that photons can travel faster and</i><br>
<i>&gt;       slower  than 'c'.  In QED.  Wanna play?  &gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
I know what it is. Light travels slower in denser matter. i.e. it travels slower<br>
in air than in a vacuum, and slower in an optic fiber than in air. It is also<br>
affected by gravity as well, which is why its slower when travelling through dense<br>
matter, but this is described in SR/GR.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;        &gt;Not according to observation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A statement without a particle of fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       We start with a uniform cubic space, say one metre along each edge.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       On the north side is a blue LED pointing south, and alongside it, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;       photoelectric cell likewise aimed southwards.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       On the south side we have a red LED pointed north, and a northwardly</i><br>
<i>&gt;       aimed photoelectric cell.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Our apparatus is rigged so that the red and the blue LEDs fire</i><br>
<i>&gt;       simuultaneusly.  The photoelectric cells record the time of flight</i><br>
<i>&gt;       of the red and the blue photons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Armed with this kit, we can do a timeslice-by-timeslice analysis of</i><br>
<i>&gt;       the positions of the photons within the cube.  We can show</i><br>
<i>&gt;       _conclusively_ that  -- for the photons to start where and when they</i><br>
<i>&gt;       do, and end up when and where they do, the red photons MUST travel</i><br>
<i>&gt;       at 2c relative to the blue photons.</i><br>
<p>
No, this is not true. They travel at the same speed, with different wavelengths.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Your whole crumbling edifice rests upon the empty assertion that</i><br>
<i>&gt;       simultaneity is impossible, and that we cannot establish a uniform</i><br>
<i>&gt;       mapping of the photons' positions.  Yet we can, and do.  QED.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     &gt;Neither Special nor General Relativity have given science or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     &gt;technology anything it didn't have anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Spectacularly wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       So name six technologies critically (patentably) dependent on</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Special and General Relativity.  You can't.  And don't hand out that</i><br>
<i>&gt;       tired old 'GPS' nonsense -- NASA use CLASSICAL MECHANICS for all</i><br>
<i>&gt;       navigational calculations.  e=mc^2 was derived classically 'way</i><br>
<i>&gt;       before SR/GR, as every knowledgeable scholar in the field is (or</i><br>
<i>&gt;       should be) aware.  'Black Holes' preceded GR by more than a hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt;       years.</i><br>
<p>
I'd like to see citations of mathematical treatments of black hole theory that<br>
precedes SR/GR by 100 years. Lessee, that means they should be published before<br>
1805.Solid state electronics cannot be described by classical mechanics, because<br>
so much of electronic theory depends on tunneling.<br>
<p>
Likewise,  lasers cannot function purely by classical mechanics.<br>
<p>
Nor can polarizing filters on cameras.<br>
<p>
the electroluminescent lamp cannot function by classical mechanics<br>
<p>
nuclear fission cannot be described by classical mechanics.<br>
<p>
the quantum tunneling microscope cannot function by classical mechanics.<br>
<p>
Ok, thats six, now where is my money?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Just name six.  If you can.  Wanna bet?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       John, I know the relativistic religion is alluring.  But it's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;       plain myth...  &gt;:-}</i><br>
