Say what?  This is BANKING that I'm talking about: an industry where no<br>
monopoly has ever *failed* to come about, without government intervention to<br>
prevent it.<br>
<p>
W&gt; We don't have to imagine this, as an operating system exists which is <br>
W&gt; (a) substantially compatible with MS Windows, (b) substantially <br>
W&gt; superior to MS Windows, and (c) substantially less expensive than MS <br>
W&gt; Windows.<br>
<p>
You're talking about Linux???  Since when is Linux compatible with MS<br>
Windows?  Are you honestly telling me that I can go to the store and buy, for<br>
example, Britannica CD Multimedia Edition for Win95 or WinNT, and pop the disc<br>
into my Red Hat system and run it?<br>
<p>
I'm sorry, but there are some things I just can't believe until I've seen it.<br>
<p>
W&gt; I hear that the Red Hat release 5.0 is even easier to install than <br>
W&gt; Windows95.<br>
<p>
It's easy to install.  Trying to *operate* it is a nightmare, at least for<br>
someone like myself who is not a Unix/Linux guru.<br>
