I think most agnostics would object to the above definition. Agnosticism<br>
is centered around the idea the question of whether God exists or not is<br>
not provable (whether through limitations of the human mind or whatever).<br>
<p>
My own idea is that the question of God is a nonsensical question created<br>
by a meme. We're infected by the virus and thus feel compelled to address<br>
the question. Brodie's "Virus of the Mind" does a wonderful job of outlining<br>
how completely useless questions arise from memes.<br>
<p>
As for Contact, the 95% figure was probably accurate in that such a figure is<br>
probably accurate for the percentage of people that believe in some form of<br>
supernatural something. Whether that means such a person should embark on the<br>
first representative is another issue. By selecting arbitrary criteria you disqualify<br>
virtually anyone from being the first representative. The obvious choices would be<br>
military-trained individuals (similar to the Gemini and Apollo astronauts) who could<br>
deal with the variety of unknowns and psychological stress that such an encounter would<br>
probably entail. However, what percentage of the world populace is military-hardened<br>
to such a pristine degree?<br>
<p>
I agree with the idea, as I would guess most people on the list would, that the first<br>
representative should be a scientist (perhaps even a mathematician) since that would<br>
be the common language we might share. Additionally, a scientifically trained mind<br>
would be able to adapt, process and toleratethe "strangeness" of the aliens much easier<br>
than a Southern Baptist minister from Augusta, Georgia.<br>
