I was speaking of very short range sonar.<br>

Subjectively this input of complex sound information could be interpreted similar to<br>
the way we intrepet visual light.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The interesting part of sonar vision is that you can tell materials</i><br>

I fairly certain there is.  I can't remember where I heard it, but there was a study<br>
done with dolphins in complete darkeness who were able to discern the identity of<br>
several sets of different tpyes of objects.  All I really remeber was that the<br>
conclusions of the study pointed very strongly in the direction that their sonar can<br>
paint a very vivid 'picture' of their immediate surroundings.<br>
