           <br>
<i>        &gt;A perfectly suited world can`t exist. It couldn`t work.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
God is good and He can do anything.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don`t think god is omnipotent in every religion. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think this is an example of people willing to abandon the idea of God but <br>
not willing to abandon the word "God".<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;So, why do you think, evolution is a horribly cruel process? </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Evolution is random mutation and natural selection. Imagine a surgeon making <br>
a random change in your body and if that change made it difficult for you to <br>
feed yourself he just lets you starve to death. For every tiny advancement <br>
evolution makes, millions of animals suffer and die horrible deaths.<br>
<p>
Darwin was a very moral man and was perfectly aware of the ghastly side of <br>
his theory.  He wrote that he lost his faith because he thought a God that <br>
sanctioned a hideously cruel process like Evolution did not  deserve worship.  <br>
He said he was very disturbed at the reproductive behavior of a species of<br>
wasp that he discovered as a young man. The wasp stings a spider enough to <br>
paralyze it but not enough to kill it, then it laid its eggs on the poor <br>
beast. When the eggs hatch several days later the maggots slowly consume the <br>
still living creature, carefully  avoiding vital organs and saving the brain <br>
for last.<br>
<p>
Darwin's best friend and vigorous defender Thomas Huxley in his essay  <br>
"Evolution and Ethics"  wrote that morality was objective, but could be found  <br>
by looking in the exact opposite direction from the dog eat dog would of  <br>
nature. I wouldn't go as far as Huxley, but I don't think random mutation and <br>
natural selection has a morality,  at least not a morality I want to follow, <br>
and if I ever meet you in a dark alley I hope you don't either. <br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Evolution is part of nature</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
        <br>
<i>      &gt;and we couldn`t exist without it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If an omnipotent and good God does not exist then yes, it's the only way.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;When I used this expression first, [freedom of spirit] I just</i><br>
<i>        &gt;thought of the  ability of taking own decisions. Maybe this was</i><br>
<i>        &gt;a language problem, as I told earlier, my English isn`t very good, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;so it`s quite hard for me finding the right words and constructions.</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I think your English is fine and I think it's impossible to understand  <br>
ourselves very well so we're never sure exactly what we're going to do until <br>
we actually do it, we're always able to surprise ourselves. I think we  <br>
sometimes have the ability to do what we want and never have the ability to <br>
do what we don't want. As for what we want, that's due either to cause and <br>
effect or it's not. If it is then it's deterministic if it's not then it's <br>
random, and if that's what you mean by "freedom of spirit" then I believe <br>
in it.        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Smullyan wrote many interesting and fascinating books and texts, so         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;try reading!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I've read all of Smullyan's books except for his books on chess.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;BTW, how many of you know D.R. Hofstadter?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I read a lot but Godel Escher Bach is the best book I ever read, his other <br>
books are wonderful too.<br>
