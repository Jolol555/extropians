<i>&gt;Presuming that "effective" means to satisfy all our needs, not just</i><br>

Having been around Europe and North America a bit, and this before the<br>
Berlin Wall fell, I think the present American system is just about the best<br>
there is today. Not by any means perfect, but preferable to almost any other<br>
system I have personal knowledge of.<br>
<p>
Other forms of government in the past may have come closer, such as the<br>
Greeks of Plato and Socrates. Even these govenments were plagued by power<br>
struggles nad politics, not to mention 'PC' thought.<br>
<p>
There are attributes in other countries that I admire, and wish that the US<br>
would incorporate. There are many things (IRS!) that I consider<br>
reprehnsible, and wish the US would reform or eliminate.<br>
<p>
Our system has the potential to become either a police state or as close to<br>
a Utopia as the Earth has ever seen. It all depends on our 'leaders' and how<br>
they run things.<br>
<p>
If the present 'war' on drugs continues, for instance, I see the police<br>
state, with manditory drug tests on every corner, and though police in every<br>
private home to make sure 'drugs' are not being discussed in other than<br>
derogatory terms. <br>
<p>
Should Libertarian ideas gain a foothold in Congress, and inroads made into<br>
repealing victimless crime laws, the opposite could be the future.<br>
<p>
I feel this is a powerful reason to vote at every chance I get, and write<br>
lots of letters to the editor. Perhaps I will do little to change the<br>
system, but if I don't at least try, I have no one to blame but myself when<br>
the storm troopers knock down my front door..<br>
<p>
As far as a perfect government ever existing, this will have to wait for<br>
perfect humans to run it, or an AI with godlike powers and intellect that<br>
somehow still cares to be our servant, to be put in charge..<br>
<p>
I for one would rather wait for the perfect human...<br>
