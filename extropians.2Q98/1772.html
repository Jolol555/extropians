  IAN: I saw something on TV about this. A dog owner<br>
  went with film crew to a shopping center and another<br>
  crew stayed at home with the dog. The owner chose a<br>
  random time to return. At the moment that she did,<br>
  the dog at home woke up and, tail wagging, ran to  <br>
  the window, looking out expectantly, but the owner<br>
  was still a good 10 minutes away from home, so it<br>
  could not have been smell, sight, or sound clues.<br>
  They said that that dog always reacted like that.<br>
<p>
  The studies cited in the Nando article Max cites <br>
  seem pretty lame in that they simply asked owners<br>
  if this happened to their pets. That's totally un-<br>
  scientific and worthless in my mind. But the arti-<br>
  cle did cite some "laboratory-type" experiments:<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
They involve setting up video cameras in the homes of pet owners to<br>
record animals' activities while their owners are away. Then they ask<br>
owners to return home at unpredictable times -- by taxi and not their <br>
own car. Reviewing this evidence, he claims that while some dogs are <br>
stripped of their psychic powers -- most are not.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   IAN: Seems he's already concluded they're psychic.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
"The most extraordinary examples," he explained, "have been dogs who<br>
begin to get excited when their owners are about to get on an airplane <br>
to fly home from thousands of miles away."<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
   I don't think we should write this off just<br>
   like that. It stokes my curiosity... What if?<br>
   I'd think that some rigid tests could be set<br>
   up that would give us some reliable answers.<br>
