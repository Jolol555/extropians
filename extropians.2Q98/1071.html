To rule out that cetacean's do not have complex language would be a grossly<br>
premature assumption at this point.<br>
<p>
Being completely non-technological and aquatic does not preclude language. There<br>
are several reasons to think that dolphins may have developed complex language.<br>
<p>
1) They have brain sizes from 2 to 6 times ours.<br>
<p>
2) Careful examination of cetacean brain tissue has show it to be as complex as<br>
ours at every level - from the number of average synaptic connections to the array<br>
of neurotransmitter activity.<br>
<p>
3) They have had 30 millions years longer than us to develop and evolve a<br>
language.<br>
<p>
What would they 'talk' about?  Here is my guess:<br>
<p>
Since they can't write anything down, they like many other pre-literate cultures<br>
could have an extensive oral tradition of storytelling and history recounting.<br>
Knowing how extensive some tribal cultures oral tradition is with less than 10,000<br>
years history, imagine how much more complex cetacean's oral history could be, if<br>
they developed complex language even 1 million years ago; less than 1/30 of their<br>
history.<br>
