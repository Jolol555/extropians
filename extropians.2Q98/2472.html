<i>&gt;&gt;    One size-matrix doesn't contain all difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This would be true if A were actually stretching relative to anything. </i><br>

<i>&gt;not in special relativity.  I am shrinking relative to you AND you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;shrinking relative to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Dan, it's a great counter(!) worthy of further</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    investigation, but it can only be sustained if </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    it can be shown that size is not relative and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    thus that one matrix is more valid, but even </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    that "more vs less" valid is another 0 sum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, perhaps you meant a different second matrix; any matrix which shows</i><br>
<i>&gt;A non-zero relative to itself is fishy, I'd say.  Perhpas you'd want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;say that:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A  B</i><br>
<i>&gt;A  0  +</i><br>
<i>&gt;B  +  0</i><br>
<p>
<p>
 IAN: My placing the + under A was an error.<br>
 What you write is the proper "got larger" matrix,<br>
 and as I shall show, it's as valid as the first.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;is true if we compare the second situation to the first, rather than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;first to the second.  The only problem with this matrix is that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;never true; B is never large relative to A.  B is never large relative to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ANYTHING; at rest it is zero, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and in motion it is negative relative to A.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since you cannot find any perspective in which A or B are positive, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;sincerely doubt your ability to get back to 0 from the -.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: A reduction (-) of B in size by 1<br>
  unit relative to A (0) is expressed as <br>
  -1. -1 is LESS than 0, 0 is 1 more (+)<br>
  then -1, so in fact A has gotten larger!<br>
<p>
  Size is 100% relative. There is no absolute<br>
  size, and that's what your case requires. <br>
  That the second matrix is valid is clearly <br>
  proven by the fact that -1 is less than <br>
  0 and 0 is 1 more than -1. If we have 2<br>
  things in the universe, A and B, and B <br>
  gets smaller, it's equally true that A<br>
  gets larger, because size is relative.<br>
<p>
  So the second matrix that defines the <br>
  zero sum of all valid data = valid data.<br>
