There is a dramatic use of this in Robert Forward's novel Timemaster.<br>
There is a backwards-in-time wormhole in space, and the good guy manages<br>
to maneuver things so that the bad guy gets destroyed.  One space ship<br>
comes out of the wormhole before it goes in, bounces off another one,<br>
and knocks its earlier self in, or something like that.<br>
<p>
I still say that it is black magic.  Once you start up one of these<br>
Novikov collisions, you won't be able to interfere.  The whole path is<br>
pre-ordained.  Any universes where you succeed get nulled out.<br>
<p>
Remember Asimov's short story about the crystals which dissolve *before*<br>
you add water?  The military used them to create a bomb by using a cascade<br>
of stages to expand the time interval.  Once a crystal dissolved there<br>
*had* to be ("had been") water added in a few hours.  Drop the bomb in a<br>
heavily sealed case in an enemy country, and a bizarre, damaging typhoon<br>
would arise sufficient to bash open the bomb, along with everything else.<br>
<p>
Not contradictory or inconsistent, but paradoxical in my book.<br>
