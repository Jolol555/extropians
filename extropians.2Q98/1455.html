<i>&gt;is there any way to confirm where you would come out at?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
you would end up on the other side of the wormhole, actually. if you <br>
were to even enter a wormhole, you would first encounter a blackhole, <br>
and pass through the throat like shape of the wormhole, and end up <br>
outside of another blackhole. if you were to look at it on a certain <br>
plane it would look somewhat like a barbell, 2 circular <br>
objects(blackhole entrances) and a handle(wormhole). so basically, <br>
depending on the distance of the wormhole between the 2 blackholes would <br>
determine where you would end up. in theory i suppose you could end up <br>
10 feet away from where you started, but be on a different plane once <br>
you reached the other end. anyone who has any more insight to this <br>
please add.<br>
