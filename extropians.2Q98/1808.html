<p>
What we should really look for is whether homeschooled kids are better<br>
in social interaction than non-homeschooled kids.  The socialization<br>
issue always comes up with homeschooling, yet I've seen no evidence --<br>
just anecdotes -- about whether kids are better or worse off with home-<br>
schooling.<br>
<p>
My gut feeling is that they are better or no different in this area, but I'd<br>
like<br>
to see some studies done.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
