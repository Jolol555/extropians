            <br>
<p>
It's only a matter of time before machines can do everything better than any <br>
human, 20-30 years might be long enough for this to happen, or it might take <br>
a little longer. I think the jobs most resistant to automation may not be the <br>
ones that people naively assume. They might not have much bedside manner but <br>
even today I'll bet a good expert system could diagnose most diseases better <br>
than most doctors most of the time. On the other hand, no machine yet built <br>
can drive a truck nearly as well as a nearsighted rookie with a hangover. <br>
Truck driving in an inherently more difficult task, it just doesn't seem that <br>
way to us because evolution made us very good at profoundly complex things <br>
like pattern recognition, an ape that was good at spotting a saber toothed <br>
tiger hiding in the bushes had lots of descendants, an ape that was only good <br>
at memorizing long lists of facts did not.<br>

<i>        &gt;what will the rest of humanity do in order to survive?</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
No reason to think that humanity will survive. The probability that in a <br>
hundred years biological humans as we currently know them will exist anywhere <br>
in the universe is low. In a thousand years I would rate the probability as <br>
zero.<br>
