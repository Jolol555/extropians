<i>&gt; &gt; quite sufficient. I think that where we are talking past each other is that you look at IP as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consequence of natural law, and I look at it as a consequence of contract law.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah.  You are correct; we have been talking past each other.  This poses</i><br>
<i>&gt; new and very different problems.  For example, suppose you have licensed</i><br>
<i>&gt; your information out to a hundred people.  Then, to your surprise, I,</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone with whom you haven't contracted, begin to market this information</i><br>
<i>&gt; publicly.  You can't sue me, because there is no contract binding ME from</i><br>
<i>&gt; distributing your information.  Indeed, the only people whom you CAN sue</i><br>
<i>&gt; are those to whom you have licensed information, and they all deny it. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have managed to remove the fingerprints you have added to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; information, then you have no way to recover your lost business.</i><br>
<p>
If I can demonstrate in court that the information is X percent congruent with the information I was<br>
licensing (as the information content in and of itself is its own fingerprint), then I can still sue you as<br>
an accessory to breach of contract, even if I cannot determine the original breaching agent. Keep in mind<br>
that under a libertarian system, there is no right to refuse self incrimination. Since I would be backed by<br>
my PPL which has a standard practice of using veradication technology on individuals testifying in court, I<br>
doubt that you could escape prosecution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (For the purposes of this example, suppose this information had been</i><br>
<i>&gt; distributed over something like TC May's BlackNet:  I bought the</i><br>
<i>&gt; information from one of your licensees anonymously; I don't know whom I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was dealing with, and neither do they, nor can anyone prove that I knew</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I was buying the information from one of your licensees.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Right now, we create IP laws in order to get around this problem: we pass</i><br>
<i>&gt; a law such that everyone is required not to use or distribute protected</i><br>
<i>&gt; information without paying royalties to the author.  Without such laws, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; could make an exchange like the one listed above, leaving you SOL.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, as you note, such laws are in no way grounded in "natural law":</i><br>
<i>&gt; they would only be created because the contract was *too difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce otherwise.*</i><br>
<p>
IP law is merely a societal contract under which the government is delegated authority to enforce the<br>
individual contract rights of all of its citizens. It does not matter if the government is a monopoly state<br>
or a competetive PPL. The principle is the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;From the perspective of a PPA, I doubt I could find a PPA who would</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce a contract like that above at ANY price: cryptography over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Internet makes it such that there would be no way to identify the</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetrator.  Whom do you prosecute?</i><br>
<p>
The individual who is in receipt of stolen goods. As the original license breaker is likely to have<br>
distributed the information to others, then you can then offer immunity if the accessory in receipt will<br>
give up sufficient relevant data to prosecute the original breacher. If the originator cannot be found, the<br>
receiver gets the hook.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry, I just don't understand how someone who claims to be intelligent could come to such a nutty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; conclusion. I hear your arguments all too often from many people, and they invariably turn out to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cheapskates who want to get something for nothing. As you can tell by my sigline, I don't have much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; respect for such people, and if I have transferred that disrespect toward you by association when it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; may be unwarranted, accept my apologies. However if it does turn out to be warranted, please don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; take it personally....I'm an equal opportunity hater.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, suffice it to say that I endorse contract law, and NOT enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; of copyright beyond that.  However, I don't think that will protect</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventors in any meaningful way; it would be as if IP did not exist at</i><br>
<i>&gt; all.</i><br>
<p>
Licensed properly, it is as good as IP, possibly even better in a libertarian world, because the inventor<br>
is not restricted by national borders from pursuing pirates.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If there is no incentive to produce new technology, then economic growth will come to a screeching</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; halt. If everyone can copy whenever they want, then the product will no longer be bought, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shared.  it would be interesting to see the welfare lines in Silicon Valley after that happens.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But despite the fact that contract law IP would be ineffective, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; would STILL be an incentive to invent new technology; it would be smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; than that available today, but not zero.  I demonstrated this earlier this</i><br>
<i>&gt; month;  see <a href="http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/4600.html">http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/4600.html</a></i><br>
<p>
I read that, which was what got me started on this whole thread. You still treat patents as monopolies,<br>
while I treat them as competetive advantages in a competetive market. If you stop treating patents as<br>
monopolies, then your argument goes away.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; However, when prices fall beyond a certain point, it is no longer profitable for a producer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; produce a product and will go out of business. When a product can be freely copied, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; longer a market for the product.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; On the contrary; copies are cheap, but not free.  However much they cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make, that's how much people will sell them for.</i><br>
<p>
With electronic duplication and transmission, the costs are almost nil.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As noted, technology would advance, only SLOWER.  For evidence of this,</i><br>
<i>&gt; take a look at the Linux operating system.  It's covered by the GNU Public</i><br>
<i>&gt; License: it is explicitly and forever available to be copied freely.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; advances slower than Windows, isn't as popular, but it's also available</i><br>
<i>&gt; for much less.  Indeed, many people think that Red Hat 5 is BETTER than</i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows NT, thanks to the open source policy.  It's also a hell of a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheaper, but NOT FREE: you'll see the Red Hat CD selling for ~$50 most</i><br>
<i>&gt; places.</i><br>
<p>
But I can go buy the Red Hat CD and reproduce it if I want. I have a CDR deck on my PC here, and I can get<br>
CD blanks for less than $2.00. Where is Red Hat gonna be when I can sell copies of their CD for 10% of what<br>
they sell it for, or even 20%? I could offer it on my web site for free transmission.  Obviously Red Hat<br>
has put some added value into their Linux offering, so how do they expect to recoup their investment if<br>
everyone can freely reproduce their product?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Technology can and does advance without IP laws, only not quite so fast.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is also much cheaper.  This is just what my argument earlier would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualitatively predicted, strong evidence that it is actually true.</i><br>
<p>
Even if it slowly advances, since there is no longer sufficient incentive for most people to invent, since<br>
they have to worry about feeding their families first, invention will again become merely the province of<br>
rich bachelors who can't get laid.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes. We can compare nations that respect IP and those that don't. Excepting the IP which those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nations steal from other IP protecting nations, we can measure the economic growth which results from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; domestically developed IP. China is an excellent example. During its cultural Revolution, there were</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; virtually no inventions developed in China, there was also zero economic growth. Once they opened</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their economy, they started stealing IP from western nations. We can extimate as a result that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of China's economic growth in the past 30 years is not due to domestic IP that is not protected, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by foreign IP which is stolen and are therefore externalized costs that boost the Chinese economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As always, there are a hundred reasons why China's economy would go the</i><br>
<i>&gt; way it did.  I'd say the biggest one is probably that they switched to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; planned economy, which is more than sufficient to kill growth in ALL</i><br>
<i>&gt; industries; invention would cease because there were no rewards for</i><br>
<i>&gt; increased efficiency AT ALL.  The economy's planned, so what's the</i><br>
<i>&gt; point?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If I'm right, IP was not the reason China had no inventions, but rather a</i><br>
<i>&gt; planned economy was the death blow to innovation.  Can you separate these</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects into "real numbers?"  If so, there's a Nobel prize in Economics in</i><br>
<i>&gt; it for you if you'll just tell us how.</i><br>
<p>
Its actually rather simple, though tedious. Its merely a measure of growth of sales of products bearing<br>
chinese patent numbers. Just as today's economic growth here in the US is almost entirely in the high tech<br>
sector. Kill IP in the US and you will have economic stagnation here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Don't give me percentages, give me numbers. I'll bet that Sasha Chislenko's economic simulator will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; easily disprove your arguments.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;sigh&gt; If you want, I can go seek out how large the software industry, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; movie industry and the book binding industries are, and tell you that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; would practically double in quantity as their prices dropped.  But that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; really not enough information: we'd need to COMPARE this with the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing IP laws; except that copyright ISN'T enforced on individuals the</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority of the time; people copy video tapes, books and software all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time; we'd REALLY need to compare it against how much it WOULD cost to</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually stop piracy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't heard of Chislenko's economic simulator, (nor could I find it in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a quick glance over Chislenko's web site,) but I somehow doubt that it can</i><br>
<i>&gt; predict the shape of the demand curve for microeconomic markets.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; general, we can only determine this based on approximations based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; marginal costs, quantity sold and prices over time; again presuming that</i><br>
<i>&gt; demand isn't CHANGING during those periods (which it obviously is).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, I'd guess that the simulator is a MACROecnomic simulator, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; uses numbers which are much easier to measure: inflation, total GDP, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; money supply, interest rates...  Yale's got one, too; it's quite good.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Come take a look:  <a href="http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/">http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, you won't find the quantity of inventions, books or</i><br>
<i>&gt; software as any of the variables.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is rather indicative, isn't it??? A lack of ability to forecast productivity increases due to<br>
technological innovation seems to be a rather huge gaping hole in a model which claims to be so accurate,<br>
doesnt' it? Of course, they only give average accuracy numbers. I'd like to see how the accuracy numbers<br>
have changed over time. Even Greenspan has noted how current economic models have totally failed to predict<br>
the present economy, which is almost entirely due to increased industrial productivity derived from the<br>
high rate of technological advancement. I'll bet that the accuracy of the model is far less now than it was<br>
20 years ago. I note that it is also restricted to a forecasting ability of only 4 years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To conclude, I can show that the area inside one shape is bigger than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; area inside another shape without knowing how large either shape is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Based on their RELATIVE sizes, I can show that one microeconomic strategy</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be superior to another; but even then I don't know how MUCH</i><br>
<i>&gt; superior.</i><br>
<p>
How do you expect to demonstrate their relative sizes without knowing how large either shape is??? If you<br>
can do that its you that should get the nobel.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; A reasonable competent fingerprint will make software not work at all if it is tampered with.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Really?  Care to name a program that uses one such fingerprint?  ANY</i><br>
<i>&gt; program?  I can basically guarantee you that if the program has sold more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than a thousand copies, someone out on the net has bothered to break its</i><br>
<i>&gt; copy protection.  There are archives of cracks available specifically for</i><br>
<i>&gt; this purpose, with lots of reasonably competent programmers on BOTH sides</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the battle lines.</i><br>
<p>
SUch schemes are not currently used as the cost is currently greater than the cost of IP enforcement at<br>
this time, due to the sufficiently widespread respect for IP protection. If this were to change, then such<br>
schemes would then become cost effective. One such scheme takes advantage of passive boot sector virus/worm<br>
technology to monitor tampering. If write attempts are made to specific hidden read only files, the virus<br>
or worm built into the software will corrupt enough data to foil the tampering attempt, making the software<br>
unusable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You only make a microeconomic argument. You do not show anything about the macroeconomic systemic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; impact.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's because I can't.  Neither could you if our situations were</i><br>
<i>&gt; reversed, and you were arguing for the establishment of general (beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; contract) laws. It's one microeconomic market; there is no equation which</i><br>
<i>&gt; will determine GDP based on the behavior of one market.  It's like asking</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to predict how tall a growing child will be depending on whether they</i><br>
<i>&gt; drink milk today or not.  They'll get some calcium, and as a trend the</i><br>
<i>&gt; child will get taller as a result.  But how much taller, and how tall in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the final outcome?  I can't say.</i><br>
<p>
However, you can predict the change in incentive to invent, and determine the utility value of invention<br>
for inventors. This gives you the invention supply curve. Then correlating rates of patents being issued<br>
with productivity growth in an economy, all other factors being equal, you can predict how change in the<br>
supply of inventions will change the productivity growth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If people merely acted in compliance with the contracts they sign, then there would be no IP</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enforcement costs. This goes back to my previous statements about subjectivity eroding respect for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contract law. You are proposing that people who produce intellectual property should not be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; protect their interests with contracts, or that people should not be bound by such contracts. Once</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; again you have exposed your subjectivist, post modern underbelly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not at all; rather I assert that if this were the only protection</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventors had against copyright infringement, they would have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; protection at all, and that this would be economically superior to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; system under which these contracts were supplemented by intrusive IP laws.</i><br>
<p>
While I assert that current IP is merely a matter of monopoly government acting as a PPL in protecting the<br>
IP licenses of its contracted (i.e. patents granted) citizens. If I were in a libertarian society, I would<br>
have a free choice of PPL agencies to contract the protection of my IP with, and would only engage in IP<br>
trade with indviduals that were customers of the same PPL or with competetive  PPL's with which my PPL had<br>
IP agreements with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If the curve is not a line, but truly curved, then it will not be 0.5Q, but some other number. It may</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be higher, it may be lower. In a commodity market, the curve makes this number very high, while in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; monopoly market, the curve can be rather low. You are only using a standard 1 for 1 slope on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; curve, which is inaccurate, disingenuous, and false.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, I can be quite certain that it WOULD be 0.5Q.  See, the way I</i><br>
<i>&gt; came across this was by the economic principle that in order for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopoly to increase the quantity sold, it must lower the price twice as</i><br>
<i>&gt; fast as a competitive business.  As a result of this effect, the marginal</i><br>
<i>&gt; revenue curve WILL strike the P=0 line at 0.5Q.  Obviously, then, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be false of me to claim that the market would fall by 50% unless the price</i><br>
<i>&gt; was actually 0; I left myself a 10% margin for error.</i><br>
<p>
I find it difficult to follow your charts due to the problems with lining up the characters. If you can<br>
produce either graphics or excel compatible charts I would appreciate it. Feel free to send these via<br>
personal email at retroman@together.net. In any event, I see something which you may not. If a competetive<br>
business only has to lower its price half as much to increase its market share as a monopoly does to<br>
increase the entire market, then obviously it is more efficient to have a monopoly provide a product. If it<br>
wants to increase its market size it must lower its price twice as much than if it were a competetive<br>
business. That tells me that the comsumers benefit twice as much from a monopoly than from a competetive<br>
business. I for one don't beleive that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; A patent is worth more if it is as broad as possible. The most broad patents are concept patents,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; while the most narrow are design patents. Even in design patents, an engineer will try to include as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; many designs as possible, to shut out competition from routing around his property very easily. Even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then it is usually only a matter of time before someone does. The main advantage that a patent gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an inventor or the company he licenses is product to is time enough to establish market presence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fine tune production systems. Once you have established brand name presence in a market and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; refined your production system, usually, there is competition on the market using alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The purpose of the patent is to give the inventor (individual or corporation) the time to recoup the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capital costs of research and development, as well as the capital costs to establish a production</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capacity. Failure to allow an inventor to recoup these costs is externalizing the costs from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consumer to the inventor and producer and therefore stagnating technological development.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In an expanding population, with stagnant economic growth and zero technological development, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resource base shrinks steadily (since technology is no longer increasing resource utilization</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; efficiency or reducing resource acquisition costs).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The inventor gets no EXTRA time to recoup losses.  And I agree, by</i><br>
<i>&gt; externalizing, the pace of technological growth will slow, but it will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; "stagnate."  The inventor will gain a percentage of the new market; if</i><br>
<i>&gt; that percentage is larger than the cost of invention, then the inventor</i><br>
<i>&gt; will invent.  If not, then they won't.</i><br>
<p>
If the inventor has to recoup his research, development, and production refinement costs and his<br>
competetors do not, then he is at a competetive disadvantage to invent. Better to let some other schmuck<br>
take those costs and steal his inventions from him. In such a situation, the incentive to invent will be<br>
negative, and invention will stagnate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, static microeconomic models are no good at all at predicting the impact of changes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technological advancement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Would you care to qualify this statement?  Could you give an example where</i><br>
<i>&gt; microeconmics predicted something that empirically did not happen?</i><br>
<p>
If it were so, then why are all of the economists totally flabbergasted at today's economy? None of their<br>
models have predicted the huge increases in productivity which are what is driving our economic growth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Too true!  So I had best BUY a copy of your manuscript, and then, using my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; property, organize my property just like the copies that belong to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; You own the manuscripts and all of the words written on them; but if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; sell a copy to me, then I own a copy, with all the words written on it.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; can do with my property whatever I please, including organizing my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; property just like your property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If I sell you the right to use my copy. You can use my copy to organize your own property any way you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; want, however you cannot sell copies of the copy I sold you to anyone else.  If you sell the copy I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sold you to someone else, and delete all copies of that copy that may reside anywhere in your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; property, then it is not theft....since if you sell the copy to someone else, you are selling them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your right to use that copy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You cannot say that this sort of arrangement is not used in any other market, as real estate deed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; covenants are widely used.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but you never try to make a covenant with multiple people for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same piece of real estate; when the lease is broken, you know precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt; who broke it.  Nor can real estate be copied.  That makes this an</i><br>
<i>&gt; excellent arrangement for real estate, but an inferior one for</i><br>
<i>&gt; information.</i><br>
<p>
If the person who bought my land from me signs my covenant, one clause in my covenant is that the buyer<br>
must agree that anyone he sells the land to is bound by the same covenant. Thus while you cannot reproduce<br>
the land (except as seen below), you also cannot change the minimum terms of sale to your customers, and<br>
their customers, etc. I can add additional terms, but the origianl terms cannot be recinded.<br>
<p>
Now, there is a way I can reproduce the land. I can build multi-storied buildings on the land, and multiply<br>
the square footage available within the boundaries of that land. So if I bought 10,000 square feet of land,<br>
and I agreed in my covenant that I will build no larger than one story buildings on the land, I therefore<br>
cannot multiply the square footage. If such a clause were not in the covenant, I could simply build a<br>
building that had 10,000 square feet on each floor, build as many floors as I could, and sell those. When I<br>
sold each floor to others, I could add to the base covenant that each floor owner could not subdivide,<br>
lease, or sublease the floor in any manner, and the buyers would be bound by my copyright of that floor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Indeed, what could you do to me if you DID lease land to me, and then I</i><br>
<i>&gt; copied it and returned the land to you?  Even if this were forbidden by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lease, how would you know who had broken the contract if someone else</i><br>
<i>&gt; started selling copies of your real estate who had purchased it from an</i><br>
<i>&gt; anonymous seller?  After all, it could be me, or any of the other hundreds</i><br>
<i>&gt; of customers you've serviced.</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't matter. Receipt of stolen goods and accessory to violation of copyright are prosecutable even in<br>
the original perpetrator is not found.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I dunno, the state owns plenty of property. As a sovereign government, in theory it holds original</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; right to all real property in its domain. People only own real property (i.e. real estate) as granted</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by the sovereign in granted deeds. The sovereign holds right to reclaim those deeds under emminent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; domain, provided the deed holder is refunded the original license fee, plus interest and compensation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for any improvements to the property.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed; this is how governments view property today; I think we're agreed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that this understanding is inferior to the libertarian system described</i><br>
<i>&gt; below.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In a theoretical libertarian society, where every man is sovereign, and is vassal to no state,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; emminent domain would not exist per se, however IP will still exist in contract law. If you wish to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; benefit from my product, you must agree to not reproduce my product. If you break that contract, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are in breach and can be prosecuted in civil court by my PPL. Others who benefit from your breach can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; also be sued, ad nauseum. It may take some precendent cases in a libertarian society, but IP will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; probably be better respected in such a society then it even is currently here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As noted, I'm all in favor of this; except that I think you will find</i><br>
<i>&gt; these contracts useless in the face of anonymous commerce.</i><br>
<p>
While anonymous money may make a significant impact on electronic commerce, I don't think that anonymous<br>
production of IP will make any significant headway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Individuals do.  The sum of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; wealth owned by individuals is not the property owned by society, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; simple sum of the property owned by those individuals.  I think we're</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; agreed on that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes, however you forget the origination of those properties. In the example of real estate, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sovereign holds all original rights to all real estate in his or her or its domain. all other land</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; holders posess their land by granted deed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In an information economy, I invented widget A, or software B. I hold original sovereign rights to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that widget or that software. I will only grant others the right to use copies of that widget or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; software if they agree to the terms in my granted deed to use that property. If they do not, I hold</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the right, by deeded contract, to prosecute their breach as I see fit. I could simply sue them in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; civil court, have it 'corrected' by a contract 'fixer', or simply go and nuke the bastids.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Remind me never to contract with you unless the terms of enforcement are</i><br>
<i>&gt; made explicit.  ;)</i><br>
<p>
Caveat Emptor is the standard of business law in New Hampshire.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And again, I must agree with you here; only whom will you nuke when third</i><br>
<i>&gt; parties start offering copies of your goods?  You don't have any contract</i><br>
<i>&gt; over THEM.</i><br>
<p>
No, but they have contracts with their PPLs, and I have contracts with my PPL. Any reasonable PPL will<br>
recognise the validity of a claim upon an individual who has received stolen goods, even if the original<br>
perpetrator cannot be found. As long as the stolen goods can be proven to posess a significant congruence<br>
with the goods of the claimant which are documented prior to the receipt date of the stolen goods, then a<br>
case and claim can be made.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; In light of that, your statement above is not correct: otherwise we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; forced to say that the sum of the property owned by individuals IS proprty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; owned by society.  However, we both agreed that society HAS no rights,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; especially not the right to own property, only the individuals have these</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; rights.  Therefore, the sum of the property owned by individuals is NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the property owned by society.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That society may hold property as a sovereign government,  if individuals in that soceity are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sovereign individuals, with some or all rights delegated to the state, then the state can own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; property in trust for the benefit of all society.  THis is how things are presently. In a libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; society, individuals would only delegate those rights which they choose to delegate on an individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, I assert that we should maximize the sum of the utility for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; each individual; NOT the utility of the society, which is not a brain and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore has no utility.  If I were arguing that society DID have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; utility, THAT would be collectivist.  THAT would be Borg-like.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Fortunately for the both of us, I'm not saying that at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes you are. You are measuring the utility of IP protection as a sum set, i.e. for all soceity. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are not measuring it on an individual basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The purpose of my parallel was to demonstrate that even if we accept a</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian understanding of property rights, ANY economic analysis must</i><br>
<i>&gt; make policy decisions based on net wealth; this is not wealth owned by</i><br>
<i>&gt; society, but wealth owned by individuals.  I don't consider it in any way</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposed to libertarianism to do so.  If arguments from net wealth are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; collectivist, then arguments from net utility ought to be no more so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I agree with the CONCEPT of your economci argument. I think that your numbers are completely wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Failure to protect IP will lead to the downfall of technological society.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I say that it will not, and I therefore cede to you that we ought to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce IP in contracts, but not as a law stating that no one may use</i><br>
<i>&gt; protected information.</i><br>
<p>
Then you cede to the existing law. As IP law is prosecuted as civil offenses, rather than criminal offenses<br>
(except when it involves transportation across state or national borders), you agree to most of current IP<br>
law as practiced.<br>
