I believe Bucky Fuller had something to say about this.  The first time I<br>
read his ideas on ecological accounting and global computer networks I had<br>
to quickly turn to the publication page to see when it was printed.<br>
It was early 1970's I think (Bucky had a long run - he pops up everywhere).<br>

The history of the economic development of the world can be described as a<br>
process of internalizing costs and benefits.  (An internalized cost is one<br>
that<br>
must be paid by the entity making the decision; an internalized benefit is<br>
one<br>
that is received by the entity making the decision.  The alternative is an<br>
externalized cost/benefit, which goes to some person who doesn't make the<br>
decision.  As an example, if the smoke from my fire makes it hard to breathe<br>
in<br>
my home, the cost of that smoke is internalized; but if it flows instead<br>
into your<br>
home, that's externalized.  Guess when I'll be most interested in<br>
controlling the<br>
smoke...)<br>
<p>
We had just seriously begun internalizing the costs of pollution through<br>
common law and the market, when the government stepped in to protect<br>
polluters from having to reimburse their neighbors for pollution-caused<br>
damage.<br>
So instead we have internalized the cost of following government-imposed<br>
pollution regulations, which are (at best) only loosely correlated with<br>
pollution.<br>
