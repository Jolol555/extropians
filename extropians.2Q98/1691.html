<p>
I must wholeheartedly agree with you, this is an excellent point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In any libertarian type society, where there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; overarching sovereign authority to enforce the public will and contracts</i><br>
<i>&gt; amongst individuals, on individuals, individuals must rely on and protect</i><br>
<i>&gt; in their daily lives the concepts of integrity, honesty, and truth to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ensure that the contracts they make between sovereign individuals are</i><br>
<i>&gt; honored. THis is the essential key to keep a libertarian society from</i><br>
<i>&gt; devolving into chaotic anarchy/civil terror. I think that demanding that</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth for a given be at least agreed to by two soveregn individuals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwize a contract has no meaning, if it means two different things to</i><br>
<i>&gt; two different people.</i><br>
<p>
I would agree.  However, I look at it from a different slant.  SINCE<br>
contract law is good for our long-term utility, we should agree on<br>
objective truth.  Strict utilitarianism demands it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Being strictly utilitarian with regard to truth means</i><br>
<i>&gt; one is merely an opportunist, with no regard for others and with no greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose other than for one's immediate short term profit.</i><br>
<p>
This is where I must disagree.  I feel like most people are responding to<br>
egoism, the philosophy which states that an action is right if and only if<br>
it maximizes the agent's utility, rather than utilitarianism, which states<br>
that an action is right if and only if it maximizes utility for the<br>
greatest number. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From this perspective, we can see that while the EGOIST might act in this</i><br>
way, (though they might take a little more care for their LONG term<br>
profit, rather than short term profit,) the utilitarian would not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Libertarians know that a stable libertarian society requires that most, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; not all members must have a distinct sense that integrity and honesty</i><br>
<i>&gt; amongst members of the community is most beneficial to every individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt; long term self interest.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  This is why I am a libertarian: because it is the direct logical<br>
conclusion of utilitarianism.<br>
<p>
With regard to your point about authoritarianism, I'm sure most liberal<br>
proponents of this form of subjective truth claim to be moving towards<br>
ANARCHO-socialism, or "true" Communism, rather than authoritarian<br>
socialism; I am not so certain that they are completely wrong.  Any<br>
thoughts on this matter would be appreciated.<br>
