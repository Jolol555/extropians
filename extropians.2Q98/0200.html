The workaround, AFAIR, is to reset the year to 1972, if that's possible.<br>
This little piece of information should be much more widely distributed<br>
as a temporary quick fix to get people going again when they hit these<br>
problems (dates in 1972 are on the same days of the week as 2000).<br>
<p>
Otherwise I agree that journalists don't seem to know what they're talking<br>
about (e.g. the CNET claims that people are saying that planes will fall<br>
out of the sky, rather than that the air traffic control systems will be<br>
hosed). I noticed a few other problems with that article, and an amusing <br>
quote talking about electrical distribution shutting down if it overloads; <br>
as though automatic shutdown is an advantage, not part of the problem.<br>
<p>
BTW, to respond to someone else's comments about panic-induced crashes,<br>
it's really a prisoner's dilemna; it no-one panics we should all win, if<br>
the others panic and you don't, you probably lose.<br>
<p>
(I have a four day break starting in a few minutes, so don't expect any <br>
more replies 'til Tuesday).<br>
