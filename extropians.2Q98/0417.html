I've never heard of anisotropic evaporation, but if a Neutron star were to        <br>
fall in or two black holes were to merge the event horizon would pulsate, <br>
it would ring like a bell. If the holes was spinning rapidly the pulsations <br>
would extract energy from the rotations and many people thought that the  <br>
pulsations would keep growing until the hole was torn apart. However in 1971  <br>
Saul Teukolsky proved that regardless of its rotational speed the hole would <br>
remain stable, the pulsations do extract energy from rotation but they do not <br>
grow without limit because they radiate even more energy away as gravitational <br>
waves so the pulsations damp down.                <br>

            <br>
<p>
Relativistic compression as the name implies depends on the observer, to you <br>
nothing special is happening you're not compressed at all. Tidal stretching <br>
(and crushing) is absolute because every observer including you would notice <br>
that your head and feet were in very different reference frames and that <br>
could be uncomfortable.<br>

<p>
<p>
Neither publicly nor privately did I announce any such thing. I don't want to <br>
turn anybody into a murderer. I did say that people should not be punished <br>
for allowing an individual to make the most important decision a human can <br>
make, ESPECIALLY if they're old and sick. I love life so I personally don't  <br>
care if you dislike euthanasia, I care a little more that you'd vote against <br>
it,  but not much because voting means almost nothing. Needless to say I have <br>
no wish to send you or half your state to the guillotine.<br>
<p>
However, if I decided to die and you felt so strongly about it you'd used <br>
force to stop me, I would with a clear conscience do what I had to do to <br>
defend  my autonomy, and if that includes causing your head and shoulders to <br>
become discontinuous so be it. Making a person live when they want to die is <br>
the moral equivalent of murder.<br>
<p>
Speaking of suicide, if a transhuman decided that eternity was just a little <br>
bit too long there is a way he could go out in style. The quasar 3C273 almost <br>
certainly has a black hole of 10 billion solar masses in it. At the event <br>
horizon the tidal forces would be barely noticeable, even by a frail human, <br>
and would not become lethal for almost an hour (your time), and by then you'd  <br>
literally be face to face with quantum gravity and a naked singularity.   <br>
Unfortunately you'd be unable to communicate your adventure to anyone but <br>
you'd see things nobody has ever seen or imagined before. Actually you  <br>
couldn't even be sure it would kill you because what the singularity is like  <br>
is anybody's guess.<br>
