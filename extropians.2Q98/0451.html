<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This requires every philosophy that might call itself transhumanist to</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; that causes a huge backlash for all technophobic thinking. That would</i><br>
<i>&gt; then make him a transhumanist,</i><br>
<p>
Not if his means is irrational. But I suppose if Rifkin were a clever<br>
transhumanist (now there's a turn of phrase one doesn't get to see too<br>
often), he might rationally design such a strategy.<br>
<p>
Neologism anyone?<br>
<p>
SAPPER MEME: An offensive (as opposed to benign or defensive) meme,<br>
intelligently-designed to infect a host, reduce the host's memetic<br>
immunity, and prepare the host for infection.    <br>
<p>
Is there already a term for this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; whereas we ourselves, if we have bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; luck, might not be.</i><br>
<p>
Again, the test is rationality. My basic point is that a philosophy of<br>
life is more than merely a hobby. At this point, transhumanism doesn't<br>
have a ton of tools to work with to achieve the acceleration of<br>
development. That doesn't mean one shouldn't do anything. I don't think<br>
anyone diasgrees with this, I just wonder if it would be an appropriate<br>
thing to include in the definition. And I think it can be included by<br>
just getting rid of 'seeks.'<br>

Yes, I tried to slip that one by without anyone noticing. :-)<br>
