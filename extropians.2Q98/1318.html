<i>&gt;this is very intrusting.  You see the reason I want to find</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone who can is I want to see what the bible realy says, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;what it is interpeted as today.</i><br>
<p>
It is important to remember that the book you know as the bible was<br>
assembled by the scholars of the Septuagint for a specific purpose.<br>
The bible is composed of less than 15% of known Judeo-Christian<br>
writings. Things were excluded that didn't agree with the scholars<br>
purpose, including the recently re-discovered gospels of St Thomas,<br>
and a series of writings you can find as a book called "The Gnostic<br>
Gospels." The Septaugint were the ones who translated these<br>
writings from Hebrew to Greek by the way.<br>
<p>
Keep an open mind and good luck.<br>
