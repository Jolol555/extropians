<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; From some public statements made by atheists around here, I would &gt; &gt;&gt; be tempted to define atheism as a fervent belief in the NON &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;existence of a supreme being...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Indeed, atheism is (often) more than just saying "it's extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;unlikely that god exists", but also "it is not _desirable_ that god</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exists". It's about understanding that, certainly for a transhumanist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;the existence of god is _not_ "neutral", but very, VERY bad. All our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;efforts would be futile. After all, don't we want to become gods</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;ourselves? No such luck if the job has already been </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;taken...(remember: if god existed he would _not_ be "nice", just look &gt; &gt;at this deathist planet and universe. Being omnipotent = being </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;responsible for all that happens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That is one of the views I have held for quite a long time. The &gt; Christian Old Testament god is a particularly nasty critter..if this &gt; is the way things actually run, I will be quite happy to tak&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, it's a sadistic psychopath by anyone's standards...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; However, I don't think the universe is 'deathist'. Life is just &gt; localized reversal of entropy. As such, it appears the universe is out &gt; to get us...Actually, for the universe to be 'deathist' wo&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or a god...That was the point: if you assume that the Judeo-Christian</i><br>
<i>&gt; God is real, than you also must assume that he doesn't give a crap about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the well-being of his creatures. Fortunately the chances that the bible</i><br>
<i>&gt; even remotely approximates the truth (where the supernatural is</i><br>
<i>&gt; concerned) are very slim, and it's much more likely that all is just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; big ol' coincidence. That would explain a lot. </i><br>
<p>
Whether there is a real god or not, there is little doubt that "God", <br>
as worshipped, is created in man's image.  Look at the crap Moses <br>
himself says *he* ordered, and see if it isn't a lot like the crap <br>
"God" was pulling in the Pentateuch.  Which is reportedly written <br>
entirely by Moses.<br>
<p>
Also there has been some acknowledgement of late that early Judaism, <br>
through sometime after the original Temple was built, practiced human <br>
sacrifice.  This is hardly unusual, most religions -- <br>
specifically including almost all storm-god-based religions -- did so <br>
at the time.<br>
<p>
(Looking at the biblical Jehovah, it's fairly obvious that he's Thor <br>
with delusions of grandeur.)<br>
<p>
All through the Old Testament, it is clear in virtually every book <br>
that Jehovah is a lot like the guy who was writing that particular.<br>
book.  As another example, Isaiah was the sort of asshole who would <br>
call down the curse of an almighty and attentive god on a bunch of <br>
little kids for teasing an old man about his baldness -- and Isaiah's <br>
god was the sort of asshole who would send a bunch of bears <br>
to kill a bunch of little kids for teasing his prophet.  (If, as some <br>
claim, he was just teaching Isaiah to be more careful about what he <br>
asks for -- that's a pretty callous way to deliver the lesson.)  <br>
<p>
Solomon's god, on the other hand, was extremely wise and <br>
compassionate, but also passionate.<br>
