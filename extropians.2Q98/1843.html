I wholeheartedly agree.  Now, suppose someone BUYS your manuscript<br>
(static, rightfully owned) and uses this manuscript to make another<br>
manuscript.  They have stolen nothing; they have rightfully purchased<br>
everything that is static.  The only thing that changes is the<br>
organization of THEIR ink and paper and energy, something which YOU don't<br>
own, nor have a right to control. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; However, if I gave YOU the same ink, paper and energy and told you to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; write my novel, you couldn't do it.  You probably couldn't even do it if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gave you TWICE as much energy.  Why?  Because you would not know what my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; novel says or is about: you would not have the information.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because I cannot produce exactly the same service as you. However, if I were given an outline</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the novel, descriptions of the characters, I could certainly create a reasonable facsimile</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the novel that you would have produced. My writing the novel is a service, the resultant</i><br>
<i>&gt; manuscript is a product.... get it yet?</i><br>
<p>
I sure do.  That means that I can buy a copy of your written manuscript<br>
and do what I wish with it.  It's STATIC you see, and I can do anything I<br>
want with my STATIC property.  It's MY copy of the idea: you sold it to<br>
me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, if I do not give another manufacturer exact plans for the widget I produce, then by</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition his widget is going to be slightly different. Even if I tell manufacturer A and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Manufacturer B to make a widget that does Job A in Manner B, they will still be slightly</i><br>
<i>&gt; different, but will do the same job. Cases in point:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Jeep Cherokee and Ford Explorer</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mig-29 Fulcrum</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) La Cage Aux Folles (sp?) and The Birdcage</i><br>
<p>
Counter-examples:<br>
<p>
1) Non-mechanical Pencils<br>
2) Aspirin<br>
3) AA batteries (despite what the manufacturers tell you)<br>
<p>
Keep in mind that widgets are mythical products with certain properties<br>
which make them easy to work with from an economists perspecive, and that<br>
one of those properties is "perfect substitution."  In other words, one<br>
firm's widget is just as good as another firm's widget: no better, no<br>
worse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is why it is most important to enforce property rights on it. This is why the word is COPY</i><br>
<i>&gt; - RIGHT, or right to copy, get it?</i><br>
<p>
I know perfectly well what it is, and think that it should not exist.<br>
<p>
Would it be too much to ask that we maintain a higher level of ettiquette<br>
here?  I don't insult YOUR intelligence every chance I get.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is important because information is very easy to reproduce, while much more substantive</i><br>
<i>&gt; products are not so easy to reproduce. Especially with software, if there is no way an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual or company can hope to get paid for its software, if the first person to buy a copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes out and gives away copies to everyone, then there will be no incentive to produce software</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the industry will die, or at least become severely retarded.</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary; all this means is that the price of copies will plummet,<br>
and as a result more people will buy the product who wouldn't before. <br>
(This is the 40-50% of the copy market to which I have been referring.) <br>
The market [for copies!] will GROW, not shrink, because the law of demand<br>
dictates that when prices fall, quantity demanded increases.  Meanwhile,<br>
the number of new inventions will decrease; I argue that the copy market,<br>
coupled with the cost of enforcement, will outweigh this loss.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So you admit that it is a severe disincentive against invention, if an inventor is guarranteed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have his invention stolen the minute it goes public. How many people will be able to devote</i><br>
<i>&gt; their lives unselfishly to producing software when they have no hope of being compensated for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the undertaking? Far Far fewer than those at present.</i><br>
<p>
It's not stolen.  He's selling copies.  People are doing whatever they<br>
want with THEIR PRIVATELY OWNED COPIES.<br>
<p>
And YES, I'm aware that incentive will decrease and that invention will<br>
decrease.  However, we will ALSO see an explosion in the copy market, and<br>
we will all save, as taxpayers, the cost of enforcing this law.  These two<br>
effects will OUTWEIGH the decrease in invention...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And I replied that I think that you are out of your hat to think so...</i><br>
<p>
... and you have yet to provide an economic argument which counters that.<br>
Indeed, you completely FAILED TO RESPOND to any of my previous points,<br>
arguing that you wanted to see real numbers.  Well, as I'm sure you're<br>
aware, these numbers don't and CAN'T exist, because this is a<br>
MICROeconomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument; while I argue that<br>
enforcing intellectual property will hurt GDP, I'm not saying that a<br>
country with IP protection will have less GDP growth than another nation<br>
that doesn't.  Indeed, the best I can say is that ONE nation with IP will<br>
do better if it stops protecting IP; because the behavior off one market<br>
cannot ever explain the behavior of the whole economy.<br>
<p>
I'd like to prove this more vividly.  Let's take welfare for example.<br>
Welfare sucks.  It hurts the poor more than it helps them, and drags down<br>
our macroeconomy.  This can only be demonstrated through a MICROeconomic<br>
argument: that it reduces efficiency thanks to distorted incentives which<br>
lead to deadweight loss.  How much deadweight loss?  No one, not even the<br>
best macroeconomist anywhere can tell you exactly how much.  It is NOT<br>
simply the dollar value of government expenditures on welfare, adjusted<br>
for inflation.  It's actually much much larger than that.  Can you<br>
demonstrate this?  Can you show it using "real data?"  (hint:  any attempt<br>
to do so must necessarily use theoretical data, in other words "uninformed<br>
guesstimates," by your account.)<br>
<p>
If not, then a liberal could say to you:  "I don't need to show that<br>
welfare is more ecnomically efficent than laissez-faire capitalism; the<br>
current state of our macroeconomy is my proof:  we're doing EXCELLENTLY.<br>
Now, how to fix Social Security..."<br>
<p>
Since we agree that welfare is bad, yet our economy is doing well, then it<br>
is plausible, a priori, that IP may be bad, EVEN THOUGH our economy is<br>
doing well.  And the ONLY way you can show this is with a MICROeconomic<br>
argument, which you think you can gloss over.  Well, you can't.  I've<br>
provided my microeconomic argument using sound market theories which WORK.<br>
Care to provide your own?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You have yet to quantify any of your claims, probably because you cannot quantify those</i><br>
<i>&gt; claims.... come back when you get real data...</i><br>
<p>
I have left myself a WIDE margin of error with 40%, using strong economic<br>
principles which are completely valid in this example.  You'll never get<br>
better data than that; nor could you provide such numbers if we DIDN'T<br>
have IP and you were arguing for its creation.  One market cannot explain<br>
the entire economy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I work in the software industry, and it is easy to create fingerprints in data and in software.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem in the software industry is a refusal on the part of nations like china to enforce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the laws they already have, because the pirates are top officials in the Communist Party.</i><br>
<p>
No, the problem is that even if we DID have those fingerprints, (which<br>
many products already do!) we'd have to monitor people's computers in<br>
order to actually FIND THEM.  Couple that with the fact that a reasonably<br>
competent programmer can disable fingerprint protection with a crack, and<br>
you've got a situation where in order to find the pirates, you'd have to<br>
raid houses at random, violating our rights and wasting our time and<br>
money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; its more a matter of prosecuting those in the breach. An easy way for, say, Microsoft to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce its own copyright is to require that all resellers of Windows perform license checks on</i><br>
<i>&gt; software on customers computers when the coputers are sent in for maintenance. I don't see any</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why Apple, Microsoft, and IBM don't get together and adopt that as an OS industry</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard practice.</i><br>
<p>
Then it will be more profitable to have your computer upgraded by a black<br>
market computer repairman.  You can't stop the market, even when you pass<br>
laws to the contrary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One interesting thing I've found is that the pirate market overseas is turned a blind eye by</i><br>
<i>&gt; most software and music producers because its a neat way to get reduced prices from their CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturers (and consequently lowered tariff costs) by cutting a deal with the chinese CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; producer that allows him to produce X number of CDs on the side for his own resale on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'pirate' market. THis way, the music or software company can continue to make huge profits in</i><br>
<i>&gt; markets where the CDs are sold at high retail rates, while minimizing their production and</i><br>
<i>&gt; shipping costs. Its really just a tax dodge....</i><br>
<p>
Again, this problem could be solved, REAL easy.<br>
<p>
Now, from here on we have a real interesting phenomenon.  Here's where I<br>
provide my argument from microeconomic efficiency, and explain the<br>
difference between the microeconomy and the macroeconomy.  You just ignore<br>
it.  Funny that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Granted they have gone up in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; recent years, but only because we have opened our economy wide to the Chinese, who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; no respect for intellectual property, nor any other type of property or individuality, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; seems. Rather than looking at pirating as a positive externality, look at the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; enforcement as an externality created by pirates that everyone has to pay. If trade with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; pirate economies were cut off, our cost of intellectual property enforcement would go</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; down again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your logic is dizzying: the more the positive externality happens, (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this is, by definition,) the more we have to pay to stop it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; happening!  Of course, if we weren't trying to pay for IP's enforcement,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then we would circumvent that part of the problem entirely.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; You have to date, only guessed. Since the current situation is one where intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; property is respected and enforced, I think that the onus is on YOU to prove your point</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; with real numbers. Until you do, all we can think of your ideas is that they are quaint</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; fantasy with no basis in fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Guessing?  Only so as to provide extra precision.  If you'd like I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stick to being very general, based on what we already know.  We already</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know that the cost to an individual of producing another copy of a piece</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of information is low, and that it does not increase significantly when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lots of people are producing lots and lots of copies.  Therefore, we know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that the production of copies is nearly completely elastic.  (HOW near is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what I was trying to guess.)  Since the marginal revenue curve for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; monopolies is half of the demand curve, we know that it will strike the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; P=0 line at 0.5Q, where Q is the quantity demanded when P=0.  If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; marginal cost curve were completely elastic, then the market for copies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would shrink by 50% thanks to monopolization.  Again, since it is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nearly completely elastic, deadweight loss is is only nearly 50%; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; guessed 40%, which gives me a large margin for error.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that history shows that lack of intellectual property enforcement causes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; invention to be severely undervalued. Looking at how national borders create natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations on intellectual property rights, and how making such rights enforceable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; across borders via tools such as GATT it seems rather clear that prior to enforced</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; intellectual property rights, invention was severly undervalued, and the rates of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; productivity growth suffered as a result. Today's startling increases in  productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; just a few years after GATT are proof that expanding the incentive to invent expands the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; rate of invention and therefore the rate of productive growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Oh, there's no question that the rate is affected. I agree: when the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; incentive goes up, invention goes up, and when incentive goes down,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invention goes down.  That's not what I'm on about.  What I'm saying is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this:  we know both that the market for copies is slashed by at least 40%</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when IP is enforced, and that the cost of enforcement is non-trivial.  Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; monopolization's deadweight loss plus the cost of enforcement GREATER than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or LESS than the deadweight loss due to decreased invention?  I say</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; greater; you know why.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Considering that you have refused to respond to my refutation of your assertion that an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; invention is a monopoly, your argument does not stand. Any engineer will tell you that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; there are always many many ways to solve a problem. Only problems are unique. Invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; is not a monopoly market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We must assume that the engineer's ability to route aroun IP is not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; significant effect, otherwise IP has NO economic effect at all: whenever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you try to patent your idea, I invent another one just like it and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gain nothing.  If this is true, then the only difference in costs between</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enforcing IP and not enforcing IP is the cost of enforcement; and that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in MY favor, not yours.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; However, if we assume that IP cannot be so easily routed around, as we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; must if we think IP will have any effect, then we must observe that IP is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by its very definition, granting the inventor monopoly rights over copies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of their idea.  This is how we define IP; there isn't any argument to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; made here.  And, since in this market copies are cheap and supply is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; elastic, the market for copies suffers at least 40% losses thanks to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; monopolization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't need to. The present economy is my own proof. YOU need to come up with proof that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; economic growth would be higher without such protections. That the US has one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; highest levels of intellectual property protections, along with among the top 3 or 4 per</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; capital incomes/standards of living, and among the highest economic and productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; growth rates for a nation at its state of development (a third world with a 50% growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; rate doesn't mean anything if they are starting from nothing.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm making a MICROecnomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument.  As you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; well know, there are hundreds of thousands of effects which have positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and negative effects on the economy, many of which are present in the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and not in other areas (or vice versa).  The only macroecnomic argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which I can present is that microeconomic efficiency, as a trend, leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; towards greater GDP.  However, the behavior of one market can never be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; used to predict the behavior of the economy as a whole.  Microeconomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; markets tend to clear and/or equilibrate; they have no business cycle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The macroeconomy is practically the antithesis of this model.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If I am right, then IP is just one of the galaxy of factors which hold</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; America back from greater growth, none of which alone could possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; explain our growth rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, theft is when someone benefits from someone else without that persons permission or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; acquiescence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If there are no IP rights, and the inventor invents despite knowing this,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then the inventor has, by necessity, acquiesced.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<p>
OK, we're back.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, how does this sound:  I declare that individuals have a right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their physical property and energy, and that anyone has the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; organize their property in any way they want, even if they organize their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; property just like someone else's property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Doesn't sound very collectivist to ME.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How does someone else know exactly how someone else organize their property?? If they haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; paid for the product (i.e. the information about the other person) then they cannot organize</i><br>
<i>&gt; their property the exact same way, can they?</i><br>
<p>
Too true!  So I had best BUY a copy of your manuscript, and then, using my<br>
property, organize my property just like the copies that belong to you. <br>
You own the manuscripts and all of the words written on them; but if you<br>
sell a copy to me, then I own a copy, with all the words written on it.  I<br>
can do with my property whatever I please, including organizing my<br>
property just like your property.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Duh, in sum is society.</i><br>
<p>
I think we're using different words to say the same thing.  Society<br>
doesn't have the right to own property.  Individuals do.  The sum of the<br>
wealth owned by individuals is not the property owned by society, but the<br>
simple sum of the property owned by those individuals.  I think we're<br>
agreed on that.<br>
<p>
In light of that, your statement above is not correct: otherwise we are<br>
forced to say that the sum of the property owned by individuals IS proprty<br>
owned by society.  However, we both agreed that society HAS no rights,<br>
especially not the right to own property, only the individuals have these<br>
rights.  Therefore, the sum of the property owned by individuals is NOT<br>
the property owned by society.<br>
<p>
Similarly, I assert that we should maximize the sum of the utility for<br>
each individual; NOT the utility of the society, which is not a brain and<br>
therefore has no utility.  If I were arguing that society DID have<br>
utility, THAT would be collectivist.  THAT would be Borg-like.<br>
Fortunately for the both of us, I'm not saying that at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Destroying the incentive to invent destroys the utility of every thinking mind. Destroying the</i><br>
<i>&gt; value of the thinking mind makes a human nothing but another animal that can be penned,</i><br>
<i>&gt; harnessed, and slaughtered at will....</i><br>
<p>
Slaughtered at will, eh?  This is either some weird hyperbole, some<br>
obscure attempt at a reductio ad absurdum proof, or a gross<br>
misunderstanding of my argument.  Obviously, I do NOT think that<br>
individuals ought to be slaughtered at will.  Nor do I think it's OK to<br>
take away static property.  I don't believe IP exists, or to put it<br>
another way:  I don't think that we should enforce the concept of IP,<br>
because it does not maximize the sum of the utility of the individuals in<br>
society.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Monopolization objectively leads to deadweight loss.  I have argued that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the law is bad for this reason.  Now it's time for you to show how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deadweight loss under my system is bigger than the deadweight loss under</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your system as well plus the cost of enforcement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't need to. I have the present system as my proof. Since your system is the new one, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to do the quantification comparing the two. Rough percentages and uninformed guesstimates</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not cut it.</i><br>
<p>
If you would REPLY to my argument, rather than gloss over it, then I could<br>
show you that my argument is NOT uninformed, but rather leaves a wide<br>
margin for error.  If you had only read what I had said about<br>
microeconomic vs. macroeconomic arguments, you would understand that the<br>
current state of the economy is NOT evidence that IP is working, any more<br>
than it proves that welfare and social security are working (and they sure<br>
as heck aren't).<br>
<p>
So you DO need to provide your own argument; your macroeconomic argument<br>
simply does not cut it.<br>
