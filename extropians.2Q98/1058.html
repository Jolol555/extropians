NOTE:  Upon rereading this post, I've come to the conclusion that we're<br>
talking about slightly different things.  So I'll try to clarify wherever<br>
possible.  <br>
<p>
Also, I've changed the subject line to include "ECON:".  We've gotten<br>
several complaints, and I think it's about time to start doing this with<br>
all of our posts about the economy.  Let's make this a better mailing list<br>
for you and me.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;While a substitution effect of that scale is theoretically possible, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;somewhat unlikely.  Even if capital DID become that cheap, we'd still need</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people to program our non-sentient robots, people to "write the templates,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people to advertise our products to other people...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Non-sentient AI should certainly be able to handle those tasks.</i><br>
<p>
Under my definition, "non-sentient AI" is oxymoronic.  My understanding of<br>
what we were talking about were robots which would only do what they were<br>
programmed to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I do not see why there should be any instances where labor has a comparative</i><br>
<i>&gt;advantage over capital.</i><br>
<p>
Go back and reread my post about comparative advantage.  I'm not saying<br>
humans would have absolute advantage over anything, just that in many cases<br>
the ratio of goods they could produce in a given span of time would be<br>
different from that of a robot.  It is profoundly unlikely (read: pigs will<br>
fly) that that the RATIO of different types of goods robots and humans<br>
could create in a day would be exactly equal, across the board for every<br>
type of good.  (It's not even the same among individual humans!)  So humans<br>
will certainly have comparative advantage in some goods.<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/3876.html">http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/3876.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's insane!  You're talking about a population bomb that's organically</i><br>
<i>&gt;built into your economic system!</i><br>
<p>
Well, yes.  So, here's my case for population growth, taken mostly from<br>
Julian Simon's "The Ultimate Resource 2."<br>
<p>
1)  Axiom.  Promoting the greatest happiness for the greatest number is an<br>
important moral good.<br>
2)  Therefore.  If the number of people in society increase, without<br>
decreasing the happiness per capita, then population growth is a good thing.<br>
3)  Observed.  Humans, on average, produce more than they consume.<br>
4)  Axiom.  Production taxes resources; the more production takes place,<br>
the fewer resources will be available.<br>
5)  Therefore.  If resources do not run out, population growth will result<br>
in greater wealth per capita.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyhow, whether you like it or not, economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth will stop whenever you run out of raw materials and energy -- in</i><br>
<i>&gt;economic terms, when you run out of "land".  Then you will have a solar</i><br>
system<br>
<i>&gt;crammed full of dirt-poor consumers and no hope of a better life.  Malthus</i><br>
<i>&gt;vindicated.</i><br>
<p>
Now, I put forward that humans have a unique and effective mechanism for<br>
dealing with vanishing resources which not only tends to solve the problem<br>
at hand, but add to total wealth in the process.<br>
<p>
When a resource becomes scarce, its price increases.  As a result of this,<br>
fewer people buy the good, noting that it is not worth its price.  As the<br>
price rises, we observe that the resource is conserved, by virtue of the<br>
fact that fewer people consider the good worth its price, so fewer people<br>
are prepared to  use it, waste it, etc.<br>
<p>
Also, when the price of a good rises, it provides a window for new<br>
technology to provide alternatives.  Suppose some future energy resource,<br>
say black holes, cost $5 per unit of energy extracted.  Now let us also<br>
suppose that a new technology, dilithium crystals, could be invented, but<br>
that it might cost as much as $7 per unit of energy due to the cost of<br>
inventing new tools to mine it, locate it, refine it, etc.  Clearly, no one<br>
will buy dilithium crystals at this price.  But suppose black holes<br>
suddenly become extremely scarce, and the price of energy from black holes<br>
doubles to $10.  First, fewer people will buy black holes, and second, the<br>
demand for an alternative is great.  Now it is worthwhile to invest in<br>
dilithium crystals, invent the tools necessary to process them, and bring<br>
them to the world.  Scarcity makes money available to solve the energy<br>
crisis.  Furthermore, once the majority of buyers switch to dilithium<br>
crystals, you'd have even more people working on the crystals, finding<br>
better ways to refine them, etc. so as to make their own profit.<br>
<p>
Best of all, in the meantime we will reap the benefits of increased wealth<br>
per capita, allowing more people to buy an education and more people to<br>
become scientists if they so wish.  We do not see a movement towards<br>
increasing poverty, but rather a trend towards an increasingly wealthy<br>
society.<br>
<p>
Note that we have to assume that people must work in order to get more<br>
money, if this process is to succeed.  Otherwise, people will not bother to<br>
seek cheaper alternatives.  Similarly, I would call the invention of a new<br>
resource and the seeking out of better refinement mechanisms "work;" and to<br>
this extent I put forward that this sort of work will always be necessary.<br>
<p>
When Julian Simon was writing, he argued that resources were actually<br>
infinite, and that those who were arguing for finite "scarce" resources<br>
were wrong.  This may not be true, as written.  However, it IS true that<br>
the amount of resources which are available to us are determined primarily<br>
by the technology which we develop, not by the remaining quantity of any<br>
particular resource.<br>
<p>
You may argue that there is an absolute limit to the resources which<br>
technology can bring us; that eventually technologies which increase<br>
available energies will run up against some physical barrier; that all the<br>
technologies which would increase energy efficiency will eventually reach<br>
some maximum limit determined by physical law.  This may be true, but to<br>
say this implies a great deal of knowledge about the universe and physical<br>
laws which science does not claim to have.  There are some limits which we<br>
are pretty certain about.  I don't anticipate any perpetual motion machines<br>
in humanity's future.  However, technology is pretty sneaky, and engineers<br>
are a crafty bunch.  So while we may not be able to get around this<br>
particular limit, there are other mechanisms, other means of extracting<br>
energy, which may do the trick for us.<br>
<p>
I do not know if there is an ultimate limit to what technology can do for<br>
us.  I suspect that there might be; but then, much of the evidence for<br>
ultimate limits which we have seen in the past have eventually been<br>
overcome.  So perhaps there is not.  If that time ever comes, then I will<br>
be willing to hear arguments for decreases in population growth, energy<br>
conservation, etc.  However, until that time, I stand ignorant as to the<br>
truth of this point.<br>
<p>
So:<br>
<p>
6)  Observed.  Resources will not run out if we do not run out of useful<br>
technology.<br>
7)  Observed.  As wealth per capita increases, spending per capita<br>
increases, including on education.<br>
8)  Therefore.  More wealth per capita will result in more educated people.<br>
9)  Axiom.  If more people were educated, we would have more people able to<br>
create useful technology.<br>
10)  Therefore.  More educated people results in more useful technology.<br>
11)  Therefore.  If technology does not run out, population growth will<br>
result in greater wealth per capita.<br>
12)  Therefore.  If technology does not run out, population growth results<br>
in the greater happiness for a greater number.<br>
13)  Therefore.  If technology does not run out, population growth is an<br>
important moral good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's what I like about them.  Let's go back to our root principles again...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any economy is a system for distributing limited resources among people with</i><br>
<i>&gt;unlimited (?) needs and wants.  Adding more resources to the system is</i><br>
<i>&gt;helpful.  Adding more needs and wants to the system is HARMFUL.  So, adding</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-sentient robots is ideal: it increases the available resources without</i><br>
<i>&gt;increasing the total needs and wants.  (Actually, non-sentient robots have</i><br>
<i>&gt;some needs, but no wants.  And when a non-sentient robot is no longer useful,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it can be destroyed and recycled, which could not be done to a sentient robot</i><br>
<i>&gt;for ethical reasons.)</i><br>
<p>
Under this understanding, yes.  However, I was answering a different point<br>
when I composed this.  First, I was asked how the poor would keep their<br>
jobs in the face of automation.  I answered that so long as the robots were<br>
sentient, more jobs would be needed, so we could expect that humans would<br>
keep their jobs.<br>
<p>
Now, I must agree that increased non-sentient automation would lead to<br>
decreased prices and increased abundance, as you say.  However, during the<br>
transition period, wages and prices might not be as flexible as we might<br>
like.  If wages fell faster than the price level, or if wages couldn't fall<br>
with the price level (due to unions, minimum wage laws, etc.) then what<br>
we'd find is people starving in an age of plenty.  Having sentient robots<br>
would ease this transition a lot, because they would create jobs in the<br>
process, rather than just filling them.<br>
<p>
And finally, in the spirit of the post above, who is to say that the<br>
happiness of a sentient robot is not as great a moral goal as improving our<br>
own happiness?  Presuming these robots would continue the human trend of<br>
producing more than they consumed, (a trend from which I see no reason a<br>
sentient robot would break,) adding sentient robots to our population would<br>
have the same effect, if not an amplified effect, as increasing our<br>
population would.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We have been conditioned to think that adding workers to the economy is</i><br>
<i>&gt;helpful, because they tend to produce more than they consume.  This would</i><br>
also<br>
<i>&gt;be true of sentient robots, at least until you reach your limits of growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, non-sentient robots have a greater advantage.  Because they have no</i><br>
<i>&gt;WANTS, they will consume much less than the sentient robot while producing</i><br>
<i>&gt;just as much.  The net gain for the economy is much greater!</i><br>
<p>
Unless the sentient robots are themselves considered part of our utility<br>
calculations, in which case the utility which would be gained from having<br>
sentient robots would be much greater than that which would be gained from<br>
simple automation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Non-sentient robots don't buy goods; and *because* they don't buy goods,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they don't add to the demand for jobs, so they don't CREATE jobs,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;GOOD!  I don't WANT to create jobs, I want to ELIMINATE jobs!  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing sacred about jobs.  There is no reason why our economy should be</i><br>
based<br>
<i>&gt;upon work, or why jobs should be equated with wealth.  At least you haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt;shown me any reason.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it goes like this: as Lorrey will tell you, "There Ain't No Such<br>
Thing As A Free Lunch."  Even if we do decrease the price level to<br>
something absurdly low, we should still expect to make micropayments in<br>
order to receive our daily bread.  Alternately, engines like advertising<br>
could take over, but advertising applies only to people who COULD buy other<br>
goods; if you're not working, then you have no income, and so advertising<br>
to you would be pointless.<br>
<p>
So I put forward that work must happen in order to keep things running.<br>
Maybe very LITTLE work needs to happen (maybe people could be paid a living<br>
salary for a tiny service, like some of the work <a href="http://www.distributed.net">http://www.distributed.net</a><br>
is doing), but work must happen, because it takes a little work in order to<br>
feed you; even if it's just a very little amount of work.<br>
<p>
If wages and prices were fully flexible, then I'd probably just agree with<br>
you, argue that increased automation will decrease the compensation for<br>
labor but at the same time make that compensation exponentially more<br>
valuable, resulting in lots of people living on low wages and getting rich<br>
in the process.  I have made that argument here before.<br>
<p>
However, I'd be a fool to claim that wages and prices are fully flexible.<br>
The market has some sticky prices, and wages are some of the stickiest<br>
prices of all.  And even if it IS primarily because of government screw<br>
ups, it seems a little heartless for me to just presume that simply because<br>
it's the government's fault, we shouldn't do anything to make it better.<br>
<p>
Sentient robots would provide us with plenty of labor, while at the same<br>
time creating jobs, which would ease the transition a lot.  They would also<br>
have their own utility, which IMO is a moral good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;And as I've been trying to tell you, more consumers DO make us better off,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by creating more jobs for us to fill.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How does "creating more jobs for us to fill" make us better off?  Please</i><br>
<i>&gt;explain this connection, because I sure don't see it!</i><br>
<p>
Wages and prices are not fully flexible, so people may suffer greatly while<br>
wages and prices readjust to the new price schema.  Creating more jobs to<br>
fill would ease this readjustment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'm not, but then, the qualitative distinction between sentient and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;non-sentient is vague at best.  I'd say that when you've got robots that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;create art, you're definitely toeing the borderline of sentience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Art is based on emotions.  This reminds me of that other post about an AI</i><br>
<i>&gt;quoting Martin Luther King on TV.  How do you distinguish an AI that has</i><br>
<i>&gt;human-like emotions from one that's merely pretending to?</i><br>
<p>
I don't claim to know the difference precisely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a purely economic standpoint, my definition of sentience is very easy: a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sentient being is one who /wants/ things.  A consumer.</i><br>
<p>
How is this different from an AI that "pretends" to want things?  ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe art shouldn't even be done for economic reasons!  Perhaps art should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;the province of non-workers who make their living by other means, so they can</i><br>
<i>&gt;indulge their creative urges without worrying about the bottom line.</i><br>
<p>
Whoever is feeding the artist has to worry about the bottom line.  So I'd<br>
propose a different solution:  if prices are so low that people can live<br>
off of twenty minutes of labor a day, then the artists will be able to just<br>
do that, and then spend the rest of their time creating art.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you</i><br>
<i>&gt;happy with the output of Hollywood these days?  Do you like walking into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;bookstore and finding whole shelves of Star Trek novels?  All those newly</i><br>
<i>&gt;minted cyber-capitalists, freed from the burdens of work,  will have a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;time on their hands to indulge artistic hobbies.  It might result in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;renaissance!</i><br>
<p>
Again, so long as some work is necessary to feed a person, work will never<br>
go away; we should struggle to make this work as inconsequential as<br>
possible, but it will never be zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;admitted that I don't want to work; why should I want my children to?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;So they can add to their own wealth as well as the wealth of others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are certainly other ways they can do that, rather than by working.</i><br>
<p>
Such as?  Some economists DEFINE the creation of wealth as economic "work."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;So they can reap the rewards of their own investments.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This does not require work.</i><br>
<p>
What will they invest without wealth?  Where will they get the wealth if<br>
they're not working?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;So they can learn to manage finite resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This does not require work.</i><br>
<p>
You think managing finite resources is fun?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Circular logic...  I should want my children to work so that my</i><br>
grand-children<br>
<i>&gt;will have an opportunity to work?</i><br>
<p>
So they don't just get fired and starve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm all in favor of</i><br>
<i>&gt;hobbies, as long as I don't have to work for a living.</i><br>
<p>
So long as it requires work to feed you, you will have to do work in<br>
exchange.  Maybe just a little, but some.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Shall I go on?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By all means!  Maybe you'll hit upon something valid.</i><br>
<p>
Let's not get testy, now.  :)<br>
