There may be engineering reasons that with current technology reversible  <br>
computers would make more errors than the irreversible type, but I don't see <br>
any fundamental physical reason why that should be so. Consider a computer <br>
with the smallest possible memory, just one bit. The computer could be in two <br>
states, zero and one. Now record something into the computers memory, for <br>
example one. You have reduced the states the machine can be in, from 2 to 1 <br>
in this case, and because the entropy of an object is the logarithm of the <br>
number of ways the parts of the object can be rearranged without changing its <br>
macroscopic attributes, that means you have reduced the Entropy of the <br>
machine also.<br>
      <br>
According to the second law of Thermodynamics you can locally reduce the <br>
Entropy of something but it takes energy to do it. The absolute minimum  <br>
energy it takes to erase one bit of information and record something different <br>
in its  place is  ln(2)kT , k is Boltzmann's  constant 1.381 X10^-23 J/K, and <br>
T is the temperature of the computer in degrees Kelvin. This is not a lot of<br>
energy by everyday standards, but it is free energy that must be dissipated<br>
as heat if you want to erase one bit of information. With reversible <br>
computing, that is where the output uniquely determines the input, nothing is <br>
erased in computation so you don't have this energy loss and a logical <br>
operation can be performed with an amount of energy that is arbitrarily close <br>
to zero.<br>
<p>
Landauer, Bennett and Merkle have shown that with  reversible computing the <br>
amount of energy needed to make a calculation can  be made arbitrarily small, <br>
by slowing down the calculation a little. Even a small reduction in speed can <br>
help a lot in energy saving, the power dissipation (per unit of time) falls <br>
as the SQUARE of the speed. More recently in the June 28 1996 issue of <br>
Science, Landauer shows (in a interesting but non practical way) how you can <br>
also communicate and not just compute information with an arbitrarily small <br>
amount of energy if you are willing to slow things down. <br>
                           <br>
None of this is an important consideration to chip designers, today's logic<br>
circuits are so huge, and they deal in such a tiny amount of information, <br>
that the effect is utterly trivial. Chip designers can safely ignore this, <br>
Nanotechnology engineers can not. In the early days there were some <br>
embarrassing incidences where people thought they were designing a nano <br>
computer, but when you looked closely at it and the amount of heat the thing <br>
would give off if operated at the design speed, you realized that what they <br>
were really designing was a first rate high explosive. They do a lot better<br>
now.                 <br>
