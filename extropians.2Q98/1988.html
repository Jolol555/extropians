In response to EVMicks question about dinosaur bones and what they<br>
are actually made of, I called Chicago's Field Museum yesterday.<br>
<p>
One of the staff paleontologists explained that although the bones<br>
due undergo some mineralization due to water penetrating the very<br>
porous surfaces they are in fact, bone.<br>
<p>
The bones of Sue the T-Rex are so well preserved in fact that there<br>
is hope to recover DNA from fossilized marrow. (this has already<br>
been accomplished other places with other specimens).<br>
<p>
Chicago may get a little too cold for a Jurrasic park.... ;)<br>
<p>
Another interesting point for EVMick, the histology (structure) of<br>
dinosaur bones is between that of large mammals and birds, in other<br>
words they are more porous especially toward the outer third of the<br>
bone and therefore considerably less dense that those of modern<br>
mammals.<br>
<p>
It is also believed by some that they were muscled more like birds<br>
rather than mammals, being lighter still.<br>
<p>
Others have already pointed out the "range" argument. Some wooly<br>
mammoths survived till about 7 thousand years ago on and island off<br>
Siberia as I recall, but due to the decreased range, they shrunk<br>
till they were 4-5' high.  Interesting.<br>
