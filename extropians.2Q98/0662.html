Speaking of "animal rights" lumps all animals together, but in fact there<br>
are many differences among animals.  Not all animals eat others, for<br>
example.<br>
<p>
It also suggests that there are only two cases, animals with full human<br>
rights and animals with none.  Actually it would make more sense to<br>
propose that animals should have some rights.  Most states protect<br>
animals against cruelty, for example, while still allowing them to be<br>
humanely killed.<br>
<p>
Some humans, such as children and the mentally disabled, don't respect<br>
property rights and are not able to commit to contracts, but we do accord<br>
them limited rights.  So this ability in itself does not seem to be the<br>
basis on which we draw the line.<br>
