Cori &lt;Fireeye978@aol.com&gt; commented:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Heinlein once had a character remark that "one can bask in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; warmth of religion, or stand in the cold light of reason."  I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; take the cold light.  It may not always comfort, but its dangers can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be met and overcome.  And it beats the daylights out of groveling</i><br>
<i>&gt; around on my knees begging for some aloof being to be nice to me.</i><br>
<p>
	No! NO!  This view so many rationalists and extropians and<br>
people like you take is so infuriating to me.  To me this is such a<br>
lie and so many extropians and others are just playing into the<br>
religious fundamentalist's hands by regurgitating it.<br>
<p>
	Just stop and think about it for a moment with open rational<br>
eyes.  It's very simple really, if you honestly try, with the mind of<br>
a child that hasn't yet been polluted.  Is it really true that the<br>
"warmth of religion" is worth "basking in"?  Is the "light of reason"<br>
really so cold?  I say absolutely not and ask how we could all be so<br>
easily deluded into thinking something so clearly backwards.  Just the<br>
opposite is what is really true.<br>
<p>
	Look out at the natural heavens some clear night and reflect<br>
back on the progress we've made during the last billion years.<br>
Consider the slope at the point of the growth curve we have finally<br>
arrived at (which is at least exponential and possibly asymptotic) and<br>
then project this same rate of progress into the future and dream<br>
about just a few of the things we are about (in another 1000 or even<br>
10,000 years) to be able to do.  "Cold reason" is obviously telling us<br>
that this heavenly natural future is infinitely better than any<br>
unnatural, ethereal neither world any religion has told us we must die<br>
(and leave our descendents) to get to!  Any heaven any religion has<br>
ever described to me would be pure hell!  Having faith that any such<br>
thing exists isn't faith, but giving up in despair that there isn't<br>
anything better.  "Fearing God" isn't basking in any warmth and it<br>
certainly isn't "comfortable"!<br>
<p>
	Take one simple example (of infinitely many) religious<br>
teaching like "Christ died that we might live".  Examine such an idea<br>
thoroughly with open and innocent childlike eyes.  Here we have some<br>
kind of immortal deity that can't die claiming to have made "the<br>
ultimate sacrifice" that we might live.  The definition of this dieing<br>
and sacrificing by the immortal is merely returning to his father in<br>
heaven and escaping from this still sick imperfect world full of still<br>
imperfect sinning mortals ofter only temporarily healing a few.  The<br>
definition of our "that we might live" is our dieing or leaving all of<br>
our loved ones on earth and never again being able to help or interact<br>
with anyone left ever again.  What a twisted lying crock!  You don't<br>
die to get to heaven!  You Live!  Our minds are so polluted and<br>
twisted with so much blatant irrationality!  It is our mortal<br>
ancestors that lived their short lives that we might live better and<br>
longer ones!  They are the ones that lived to gave us everything we<br>
have including our lives.  Soon, because of what our ancestors have<br>
given us and by our living, we will be able to give to our children<br>
immortal lives.  We are the ones doing the work, making real<br>
sacrifices, and creating heaven for our children!  And the heaven we<br>
are creating will eventually be a naturally real heaven unimaginably<br>
better than all the contradictory, incomprehensible, neither world<br>
heavens ever described and claimed by the many religions which are<br>
really all hells at best.<br>
<p>
	If you honestly think about it, even in the "cold light of<br>
reason" there can be the possibility or hope of a resurrection.  How<br>
can any truly rational person deny the possibility that after another<br>
billion years of the continued progress which we have seen so far,<br>
that our children will not eventually evolve to be true Gods that<br>
finally discover some way to resurrect all people that have ever<br>
lived?  A way for them to eliminate all evil including repaying the<br>
debt they owe to our ancestors for creating them, as immortal Gods,<br>
and giving them this glorious true natural and real heaven?<br>
<p>
	One could go on forever showing how unnatural religious "after<br>
life" neither worlds are really hell and how this living universe is<br>
the most beautiful and naturally glorious place anything could<br>
possibly be.  Don't support the lying God fearing unreliable religions<br>
fundamentalists and spout the irrational twisted lies they've planted<br>
in your minds!  Look out at the reliable and understandable stars and<br>
realize that this is the true and best possible heaven!  That there is<br>
so much more that we can have faith in and hope and strive for!  Don't<br>
give up in hopeless despair and accept that this is the best an all<br>
powerful being could do!  Let's get busy and show how easy it is to<br>
overcome all evil and prove the faithless, theodicizing, fearful,<br>
justifying, backwards, fundamentalist completely wrong!  Let's show<br>
them what faith and hope really are, open our eyes and see what heaven<br>
might really be, and never give or accept anything less until we get<br>
there!<br>
<p>
	Well, anyway, that's my opinion! ;)<br>

P.S. Could anyone give me a reference to where one of Heinlein's<br>
     characters makes this remark?<br>
