<p>
When we say that a particular ethical theory is right, it seems to follow<br>
(IMO) that this does not apply to any particular person; if egoism is<br>
correct, then it is correct for everyone.  Correctly stated, this is the<br>
generalization principle:  That if an ethical theory it is right for me,<br>
it is also right for you.  If it is rational for me to act only in my<br>
self-interest, then it is rational for you to do the same.<br>
<p>
Now, from an egoistic standpoint, it is NOT good for me if everyone acts<br>
egoistically.  I conclude that if I believe that egoism is correct, then<br>
egoism is bad for me.  Since egoism demands that we reject anything that<br>
is bad for us, egoism seems to demand that we reject itself. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I'm failing to see is how generalisation can</i><br>

<p>
Do you disagree with the axiom that if an ethical theory is true then it<br>
is right for everyone?  It seems self-evident to me.<br>
<p>
An ethical theory is right if and only if it is right for everyone. <br>
According to egoism, egoism is not right for everyone. According to<br>
egoism, egoism is wrong. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If generalisation is detrimental to the egoist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the egoist should insure that others do the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong thing. That does not seem logically</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconsistent. Wouldn't this make it the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational choice?</i><br>
<p>
Not really, because it would be "rational" for everyone else to do the<br>
same thing, which would leave everyone worse off; a theory of<br>
rationality which demands sub-optimal consequences is fundamentally<br>
fishy, IMO.<br>
<p>
When we adopt egoism, we find ourselves in a kind of a prisoner's dilemma<br>
with the rest of the world: while it may seem better for us to act for<br>
ourselves, it is quite bad for us if everyone does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would this apply to the immortalist? Surely you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can make no such assumption when faced with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility of eternal life.</i><br>
<p>
This is why that point was arguable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem is, I see no rational reason to accept</i><br>
<i>&gt; the generalisation principle.</i><br>
<p>
It is simple: if an ethical theory is right, then it is right for<br>
everyone.  Egoism is not right for everyone by its own standards;<br>
therefore, when we presume egoism is right, we must conclude that it is<br>
wrong.<br>
