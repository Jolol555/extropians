<p>
Free association (Einstein's basic inspiration) is non-rational creativity,<br>
not irrational creativity.  Non-rational creativity is not in conflict with<br>
rational creativity. <br>
<p>
Rational creativity doesn't exclude the non-rational process of innovation,<br>
inspiration, originality, vision and daring.  <br>
<p>
Rational thinking is advantageous to creative thinking.   If I have a<br>
visionary idea (non-rational creativity) and want to take it to fruition -<br>
produce it - rational thinking is my best bet. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You cannot get these</i><br>

<p>
I don't think that anyone is making this claim.  <br>
