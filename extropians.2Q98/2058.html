<p>
It would be more precise to say truth OR falsity.  If we define blue to be<br>
a single photon with a wavelength above a certain threshold, Measuring an<br>
average to within +/- 1 nm means that some of the particles will be above<br>
the threshold and some below, or that some of the light is truly blue and<br>
some is not. For an individual particle, however, it would be wrong to say<br>
that the statement is true and false.  Fortunately, since we're talking in<br>
a metalanguage here, we can imagine statements sufficiently well defined<br>
to eliminate ambiguity such as "the light is blue" would cause in this<br>
example. <br>
<p>
To return to my waltzing example, on the first beat of each measure my<br>
average location will be on the border of Mexico and America.  If "in<br>
Mexico" is defined to be located anywhere from the border south, then I am<br>
in Mexico and I am in America.  This is not the same as saying Truth AND<br>
Falsehood, unless we posit the illogical premise that "If one is in<br>
America, one cannot be in Mexico."  Clearly, since you are in America and<br>
in Mexico when you are on the border, the premise is false; it would be<br>
true if one was in Mexico if and only if one was SOUTH of the border, in<br>
which case I would be in neither America nor in Mexico when I was standing<br>
on the border; again, this is only a problem if we posit that "One must be<br>
in either Mexico or America," an obviously false premise under these<br>
definitions.<br>

<p>
True, but take this example to its logical extreme:  450 +/- 300nm would<br>
hardly be called blue by most, despite the fact that its peak may lie in<br>
the blue range.<br>
<p>
At any rate, if we say that something is blue or not depending on what the<br>
probability curve looks like rather than the wavelength of the individual<br>
particle, then you NEVER have ambiguity of the sort described here:<br>
quantum DOES allow you to describe the shape of the probability curve for<br>
location and for momentum with perfect precision; you never even have to<br>
have uncertainty in a well defined example of this sort.<br>
