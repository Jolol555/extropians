<i>&gt;Wouldn't the bit be something which can be used to symbolize or carry</i><br>
<i>&gt;information, but not be information itself?  Or am I completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;misunderstanding the issue at hand?</i><br>
<p>
By information you usually mean a sequence of bits, ie a string of 1s and<br>
0s. A bit is an abstract thing, and must be encoded somewhere, eg on a<br>
magnetic tape. Information does not provide meaning until you interpret it.<br>
(It is possible for the same piece of information to provide multiple<br>
interpretations, and can thus mean different things to different observers.)<br>
<p>
So maybe one should regard the interpretation as more fundamental that the<br>
information. I like that because it gives you a more process oriented view<br>
(its not as platonic). But then, given the right interpretation, an<br>
interpretation itself can be interpreted as information. And we're kind of<br>
back were we started...<br>

Gerhard:<br>
<i>&gt;'Information' is an extremely esoteric concept, particularly when taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;from an information theoretic point of view.  I'm fairly certain that there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;deep connections between information and existence - take, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the information theoretic definition of entropy and the definition of entropy</i><br>
<i>&gt;in statistical physics.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I recall a formula like H(X) = -SUM ( p_i log p_i ) as a measure of<br>
both information and entropy. What I meant by simple minded was that it's a<br>
very quantitative measure. Meaning on the other hand is very qualitative. I<br>
have a 2G disk drive full of apps, but that figure doesn't tell me what I<br>
can do with those apps.<br>
<p>
For that I need something better, perhaps the application version number.<br>
Isn't there a omega point theorem that says: when the amount of information<br>
and processing power goes to infinite, so does the version number of Excel.<br>
