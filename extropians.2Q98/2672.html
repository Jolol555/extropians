&lt;&lt; 	"For reasons that are beyond us"?  My God commanded me to kill<br>
 and/or hate this person!  Don't ask me why because the reasons are<br>
 beyond us!  What a lame justification for all the evil done by the<br>
 many religions!  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The point is simply that it is possible that such reasons could exist and<br>
that, given a strong inclination to believe or actual belief in God, the<br>
presence of evil does not provide a good reason to dispense with it because of<br>
the possibility of these unknown reasons.  Can anyone say, "There IS a reason<br>
for this, really.  I just don't know what."?  Of course.  But so what?  That<br>
doesn't make the argument unsound.<br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; 	Ah, the old perverted blame evil on free will theodicy.  Yeah,<br>
 free will makes a great scapegoat for God right!??  First off, placing<br>
 the blame on free will (free will in this view must be bad or<br>
 malevolent since it is the cause of evil), to me, is far worse than<br>
 thinking that God is actually malevolent or the cause of evil.  To me,<br>
 free will is something good and glorious and when perfectly achieved<br>
 by all will finally eliminate all evil.  Since evil is, by definition,<br>
 that which we don't want.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Oh?  I think that there are moments when I've desired something that I would<br>
otherwise think to be evil, e.g. the immediate and violent death of the driver<br>
in front of me.  So I reject your definition of evil as rendered.  The fact<br>
that evil isn't simply "what we don't want" undercuts the rest of your<br>
argument.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; ... 	And finally, the biggest reason this free will theodicy is so<br>
 perverse is because of the hate and intolerance that must go along<br>
 with it.  Some people freely choose good.  We are to love these<br>
 people.  Some people freely choose evil.  We are to hate and be<br>
 intolerant of these people (rather than try to be sympathetic of why<br>
 the particular evil choices might have been made and having a hope<br>
 that we might help).  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The above simply has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  Hate and<br>
intolerance do not necessarily go along with the free will defense.  But if<br>
the unspoken religion you're criticizing here is Christianity, then I should<br>
say that most Christian churches do preach and encourage unconditional love,<br>
regardless of the individual's crimes.  And, whether or not that is the<br>
unspoken religion you're speaking of, it does not follow, necessarily, from<br>
the fact that a person has chosen evil that a person ought to be hated.  There<br>
are numerous moral systems, compatible with theism, that argue against such a<br>
principle.<br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt; 	To me, free will is not malevolent and is exactly compatible<br>
 with the non existence of evil.  As long as there is evil, no one is<br>
 yet truly free.  I will eternally have faith that such perfection is<br>
 possible and will eternally strive for such with unconditional love<br>
 for all.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
It's a beautiful picture of free will, and a breathtaking painting of the<br>
future, but I'm just not sure that it's accurate.  Still, I have to admit that<br>
it's quite appealing.<br>
<p>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; 	OK!  My God is the Devil.  Whatever evil he commands should be<br>
 done.  Anyone that deviates from all such absolute decrees will burn<br>
 in hell for eternity!  This is such a lame and devilish reason!  Good<br>
 is good and bad is bad.  Anything that is Good is Godly and anything<br>
 that is Bad is devilish.  That is the only possible way to know the<br>
 difference.  If this is not true, then there is nothing rational at<br>
 all and no way to know the difference.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Not at all.  I probably just wasn't clear.  If God is the source of all<br>
ethical law, then what he decrees as good simply will be good, and to talk of<br>
him decreeing evil as good is simply nonsensical.  And if he is the source and<br>
generator of such law, then it seems plausible that such laws are not<br>
applicable to him.  I'm not a big fan of the idea of "divine-command theory<br>
ethics" either though.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;&gt; Now I certainly find many of those reasons as repugnant and<br>
<i> &gt; implausible as you do.</i><br>
 <br>
 	Undoubtedly for some of the same reasons I've described.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Yep.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;&gt; But they show that a reconciliation of God with evil does not<br>
<i> &gt; NECESSARILY lead to either 1 or 2.  And that was my point.</i><br>
 <br>
 	So, then, you think it is OK to hate devils and all their<br>
 worshipers, as long as we can still have faith in our God!?  This is<br>
 only one of many many reasons why I just can't see how anyone can make<br>
 such points.  Thinking like this just makes more evil, hate, and<br>
 despair.  If we have true faith that all might be possible one way or<br>
 another we need not accept any of this evil and despair.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I think that you're assuming that any form of theism must be some particularly<br>
pernicious form of fundamentalist Christianity.  That simply isn't the case<br>
though; there are lots of different types of theisms.  And not all of them<br>
involve hate or devils, but an ethic of unconditional love and eventual<br>
paradise, or fulfillment, that you yourself seem to hold to, or strive for.<br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; 	Yes, I can see your point.  But accepting any such evil, for<br>
 whatever justification, is the lessor theory.  The theory that a way<br>
 can be found to eliminate all such evil is the greater theory.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I simply disagree.  Suppose that we found very good, very persuasive reasons<br>
why we should allow for evil.  And then suppose someone came along with<br>
another theory, which provided a way to eliminate all such evil but in a way<br>
that violated those very good reasons that are vital to the first theory.  I<br>
think that the first theory would to be preferred in such a case.  Therefore<br>
the theory that finds a way to eliminate all evil is not necessarily to be<br>
preferred to a theory which allows for some evil.<br>
An example would be the comparison of a theory that eliminates evil by, in one<br>
great and last evil act, eliminating all life and all possibility of future<br>
life against a theory that prescribes certain restraints on actions against<br>
evil, because such actions would themselves be evil, but that by prescribing<br>
such restraints also allows for the continued existence of evil.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I always hope that there might be some way<br>
 or another found to eliminate all evil and will eternally seek after<br>
 such!&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
;) May God be with you on your quest then.<br>
<p>
Seriously now, that's a very noble pursuit and hope, and, in the end, the best<br>
attitude to take towards evil I think.  Good luck!<br>
