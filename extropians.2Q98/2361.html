Yes, this is the theoretical basis for why the principle of my Lorrey Drive<br>
works. As the article states, one can generate thrust, while keeping in<br>
compliance with the currently known laws of physics, without necessarily having<br>
to expend reaction mass in the opposite direction from the thrust vector.<br>
<p>
While John Campbell's early publicizing of Dean's Drive may have been premature,<br>
as his device did have some serious failings which in the laboratory were able<br>
to cancel out or mask the actual thrust produced, my own design I think shall be<br>
found to overcome these shortcomings. I think that is will also be found that<br>
Woodward's work with capacitors in testing this refinement of Mach's Principle<br>
will confirm the work of Dr. TT Brown of Stanford back in the 30s-50s, and<br>
validate the Beifeld Brown effect as a manfestation of this refinement of Mach'r<br>
Principle in the Woodward effect.<br>
