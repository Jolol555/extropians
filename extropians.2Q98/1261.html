There is a very dramatic article about cancer research on the front page of <br>
today's New York Times, the headline is "A Cautious Awe Greets Drugs That  <br>
Eradicate Tumors In Mice".<br>
<p>
All cancers must induce normal cells to produce blood vessels to supply the <br>
tumor with the nutrients it needs. A few years ago Dr. Judah Folkman at <br>
Children's Hospital in Boston discovered two very rare  proteins in human <br>
blood that he thought might interfere with this process.  Progress has been <br>
slow up to now because it was very difficult to make enough of the stuff to<br>
work with, it takes hundreds of gallons of blood to make enough to treat one <br>
mouse, but now the results of a double blind study are in and they could not <br>
be better. 10 mice with huge very advanced tumors were given injections of <br>
the proteins and 10 were given injections of salt water. After two weeks all <br>
10 mice who got the salt water were dead, all 10 mice who received the <br>
proteins were alive and healthy, their tumors could not be found even with a <br>
microscope. As for side effects, Dr. Folkman injected some mice with 4 times <br>
as much as needed to shrink the largest tumor but he could find no ill <br>
effects. There doesn't seem any chance that cancer will develop an immunity <br>
to these 2 new drugs over time, tumors, bacteria and viruses  can do that<br>
because they have the ability to rapidly reshuffle their genetic makeup and <br>
mutate, but these drugs don't work on any of those things, they  works on <br>
normal cells that supply tumors with nutriments, and normal cells don't <br>
mutate like that.<br>
<p>
No human has taken these protein drugs yet but that will change in just a few  <br>
months, genetic engineers have inserted the genes for their manufacture into <br>
yeast and now we can brew it like beer and produce it by the ton. Until it <br>
has been tried on humans however Judah Folkman refuses to say he has found a  <br>
cure for cancer, all he will say if that "if you have cancer and you are a <br>
mouse we can take good care of you".<br>
<p>
Dr. James Watson, the genius who co-discovered of the double helix and is one  <br>
of the true giants of this century thinks Dr. Folkman is being far too modest:<br>
<p>
"Judah is going to cure cancer in two years [...] Dr. Folkman will be <br>
 remembered along with scientists like Darwin as somebody who permanently <br>
 altered civilization".<br>
