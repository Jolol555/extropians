<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Libertarianism is not in the best interest of most people and they vote</i><br>
<i>&gt; accordingly (for a minority group it is, or seems to be, in their best</i><br>
<i>&gt; interests and they also vote accordingly).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally I think it's a combination of both.  ...</i><br>
<p>
The two collapse into one:<br>
(1,2).  Libertarians assume a weaker time-preference than the median<br>
voter in fact holds.<br>
<p>
Consider also:<br>
3.  Certain key results in economic science, which make libertarianism<br>
more persuasive, are not yet widely known.  (*Why* they are not widely<br>
known is left as an exercise ;) )<br>
