AS&gt; I realize that their complexity is less than the chemical networks of<br>
AS&gt; many bacteria, so I don't feel too bad about them. But this may become<br>
AS&gt; a real problem in the future - the other graduate students here (me<br>
AS&gt; included) are quite interested in creating a sentinent system if<br>
AS&gt; possible, and once we start to get close to that, then we are going to<br>
AS&gt; need to think much more about ethics.<br>
<p>
So, what do you think about rule-based AI projects, like Cyc?<br>
<p>
AS&gt; But sentinent beings are ends in themselves in some sense.<br>
<p>
Yeah, but an end that must be very carefully considered.  <br>
<p>
I've thought about what kind of philosophical /purpose/ or role such artifical<br>
sentient beings could fill.  They would, in practical terms, be a branch of<br>
humanity.  They would be products of our culture, our civilization --<br>
essentially humans in different form.  No identity of their own.<br>
<p>
When I was young I read lots of SF stories about aliens.  Aliens were cool! <br>
There's something to be said for the idea of humanity not being alone in the<br>
universe.  But, it now seems unlikely that our galaxy is teeming with aliens<br>
just waiting for us to come and meet them.  We need to create our own aliens.<br>
<p>
I would like to find an Earth-like planet somewhere, or maybe terraform a<br>
planet, and create a race of beings to inhabit it.  Drop the first generation<br>
on the planet's surface with nothing: no language, no tools, no experience. <br>
Then sit back and watch as they build their own civilization from nothing: a<br>
slow and painful process, no doubt.  But, everything they had would be theirs,<br>
not something borrowed from us.  They could develop a complete identity of<br>
their own.<br>
<p>
AS&gt; Just you wait until the first AI is interviewed on CNN and starts to<br>
AS&gt; quote Martin Luther King... :-)<br>
<p>
I shudder.  What if that AI turns out to be one of the non-sentient ones,<br>
under my definition?  The bush robot I described earlier could certainly put<br>
on that sort of performance, if it's owner told it to.<br>
<p>
What happens when a highly sophisticated, non-sentient AI can pass the Turing<br>
Test?  How do you convince most people that a machine is non-sentient when it<br>
can so convincingly /pretend/ to be?<br>
