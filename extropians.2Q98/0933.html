It isn't that we don't care, but that we think that the absence of<br>
force would do a lot more than any governmental program<br>
could for the poor.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In several days of hashing out these issue</i><br>

person has<br>

either we<br>

compassionate<br>

<i>&gt;have always liked the idea of a minimum guaranteed income and others</i><br>
similar to<br>

and my<br>
<i>&gt;challenge was to *them* to come up with a solution.  So far they have</i><br>
failed to<br>
<i>&gt;so.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know that there *is* a social solution.  That is, one that<br>
we can plan for ahead of time.  The difficulty is that the first<br>
posthumans will be far more powerful than any group or <br>
organization that we could now form, and so we cannot <br>
enforce 'good' behavior.  I don't know of any substitute for<br>
effort, whether capital effort or actual work, if one wants to<br>
keep up, but if one is willing to stay at the same standard<br>
of living, a continually (and sharply) decreasing amount of<br>
work will allow it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;****  So again I ask, is their any anracho-capitalist who can</i><br>
demonstrate how the<br>
<i>&gt;free-market can support and sustain a wide-spread liesure-class society</i><br>
without<br>
<i>&gt;resorting to "faith" that it simply will.  If your conclusion is that we</i><br>
must all<br>
<i>&gt;continue to work in some form or another, then I DON'T WANT TO HEAR </i><br>
<i>&gt;FROM YOU!****</i><br>
<p>
Whoops.  Sorry, but without using force, you have to <br>
provide someone else with value, in order to get<br>
value from them.<br>
