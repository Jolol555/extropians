<i>&gt; The first genetic marker has been found for a gene that has a weak but </i><br>

<i>&gt; the journal "Psychological Science". Plomin studied the genes of 204 children, </i><br>
<i>&gt; none were retarded and 51 of the kids had an IQ of 160 or higher. He found</i><br>

This isn't as exciting as it sounds, unfortunately. The gene codes for<br>
an immune protein, and there are a few other intelligence-related<br>
genes I have heard about which are also immune-linked. Partially this<br>
is because they are easy to test for, but I think there is a fairly<br>
easy explanation for the immune-IQ correlation: if you have a strong<br>
immune system, you have more time and energy in school (or elsewhere)<br>
where your brain will be trained.<br>
<p>
Still, it is promising. It is when we start to find brain proteins<br>
linked with intelligence we should really start to cheer!<br>
