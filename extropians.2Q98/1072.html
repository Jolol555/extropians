<i>&gt; Being completely non-technological and aquatic does not preclude language. There</i><br>
<i>&gt; are several reasons to think that dolphins may have developed complex language.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) They have brain sizes from 2 to 6 times ours.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Careful examination of cetacean brain tissue has show it to be as complex as</i><br>
<i>&gt; ours at every level - from the number of average synaptic connections to the array</i><br>
<i>&gt; of neurotransmitter activity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) They have had 30 millions years longer than us to develop and evolve a</i><br>
<i>&gt; language.</i><br>
<p>
None of these reasons hold water (pun not intended); brain size<br>
doesn't correlate well with intelligence (ratio brain size / skin area<br>
seems to work better, but it is still crude) and certainly not with<br>
speech abilities (elephants vs some birds). That their brains are<br>
complex and similar to ours isn't surprising, we are related after<br>
all, but so are mice too - different parts of the brain have<br>
developed. Finally, 3 is rather silly, since we have also had tens of<br>
millions of years to develop languages (but we didn't).<br>
<p>
Still, I think we all can agree that the signals whales send are<br>
complex, have "cultural" properties and appear to affect the behavior<br>
of other whales in the pod, so calling it a language isn't far<br>
off. The main question is how much intelligence and culture is involved.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What would they 'talk' about?  Here is my guess:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since they can't write anything down, they like many other pre-literate cultures</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have an extensive oral tradition of storytelling and history recounting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Knowing how extensive some tribal cultures oral tradition is with less than 10,000</i><br>
<i>&gt; years history, imagine how much more complex cetacean's oral history could be, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; they developed complex language even 1 million years ago; less than 1/30 of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; history.</i><br>
<p>
In that case we would notice repeating patterns which remained as the<br>
whale songs changed over time (classic idioms, references to the whale<br>
equivalent of the sacking of Troy etc). Have any such patterns been<br>
discovered?<br>
<p>
While the idea of oceanic Homers is appealing, I'm not sure if it is<br>
true. Especially since in order to sing epics you better have a<br>
language able to deal with everyday experiences too (currents, social<br>
relations, food, dangers etc), and experiences worth retelling. So<br>
another prediction would be quick communications between individuals<br>
("Honey, have you seen that school of fish? I'm sure I left it here<br>
somewhere...") and long "epic" communications ("May the muses lend me<br>
their fins..."); this should be possible to check on a cetacean<br>
website.<br>
