&lt; I'd like to start a thread on the compatibilities<br>
and incompatibilities between Objectivism and<br>
Extropianism.  I know many list members have<br>
sympathies for the former.  I generally consider<br>
myself to be Objectivist or, at least, heavily<br>
colored by Objectivism.  Is this a plus or a minus? &gt;<br>
<p>
I haven't read any works of Objectivism (capitalized<br>
or not), but I'm mostly attracted to the free-market<br>
libertarianism that seems to result from such<br>
thought.  On the other hand, I'm also attracted to<br>
some of the (predominantly) European science and<br>
philosophy that emphasizes constructivist aspects of<br>
human knowledge and 'non-Cartesian cognitive science'<br>
\1, even though (unfortunately) many of these same<br>
sources seem to gravitate toward socialistic<br>
economics &amp; politics \2 \3.<br>
<p>
More coherent objections to Objectivism (than those<br>
mentioned in note 3 ;) are raised by Hungarian<br>
physician, chemist, and philosopher Michael Polanyi<br>
(whose major work - _Personal Knowledge: Towards A<br>
Post-Critical Philosophy_ - I am trying to read<br>
sporadically).  Polanyi's work describes what he<br>
calls 'tacit knowledge'.  A good online intro to<br>
Polanyi's thought is Richard T. Allen's 1996<br>
Polanyiana article \4, "Polanyi's Overcoming of the<br>
Dichotomy of Fact and Value", where Allen declares:<br>
<p>
"Life then is a realm of achievement and not of mere<br>
processes and events... there are no neutral facts,<br>
nor mere descriptions of them, in the realms of<br>
machinery and devices, organisms and organs, and<br>
conscious beings and intelligent and intentional<br>
activities. The facts here are complexities of<br>
success and failure, correctness and incorrectness,<br>
and can be understood only as such".<br>
<p>
This Allen article is strongly critical of what he<br>
calls 'Objectivism'. I think what he means by<br>
Objectivism follows Polanyi's usage and primarily<br>
refers to behaviorist psychology and Marxist<br>
sociology, plus strongly reductionist science that<br>
attempts to reduce everything to the physico-chemical<br>
level of description, and (perhaps) not necessarily<br>
(at least not explicitly) to the Objectivism<br>
enunciated by Ayn Rand and her elaborators.<br>
<p>
Let me cite a passage from the end of Polanyi's<br>
_Personal Knowledge_ (I skipped ahead ;) which, I<br>
think, shows the extropic nature of his thought \5: <br>
<p>
"Let me now introduce the concept of a heuristic<br>
field... The lines of force in a heuristic field<br>
should stand for an access to an opportunity, and for<br>
the obligation and the resolve to make good this<br>
opportunity, in spite of its inherent<br>
uncertainties... Can we see then all the works of the<br>
human mind invisibly inscribed already in the<br>
configuration of the primeval incandescent gasses?<br>
No, we cannot; for the capacity of coming to life is<br>
due to the power of a field to consolidate centres of<br>
first causes. Each such centre bears a possibility of<br>
achievement which, however limited, uncertain, and<br>
unspecifiable in its outcome, characterizes this<br>
centre as an essentially new and autonomous prime<br>
mover".<br>
<p>
I would be interested to hear if anyone else familiar<br>
with Polanyi's philosophy (or based on the excerpts<br>
provided) thinks this is compatible with pancritical<br>
rationalism and Extropianism \6.<br>

Notes:<br>
<p>
\1. See for example, Ronald Lemmen's Non-Cartesian<br>
Cognitive Science and Philosophy pages, with MANY<br>
interesting links, at<br>
<a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/ronaldl/noncartesian.html">http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/ronaldl/noncartesian.html</a><br>
 and also Alex Reigler's Radical Constructivism page,<br>
at <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/cognition/constructivism">http://www.univie.ac.at/cognition/constructivism</a> <br>
<p>
\2. Note the recent Edge debate between "The Two<br>
Steves [Pinker and Rose]" at <a href="http://www.edge.org">http://www.edge.org</a> as<br>
well the list discussion of this between Gburch1 and<br>
myself on the 'politics of autopoiesis'.  <br>
<p>
\3. I am also morbidly fascinated with the radical<br>
philosophy of Deleuze &amp; Guattari (I would say<br>
extropian, *in some respects* - see, for instance,<br>
the surplus-value semiotics described in the Guattari<br>
interview mentioned below), despite their avowed<br>
communism; because, I think this politics is<br>
sometimes the result of social situations and, in<br>
another life (or if they'd paid attention to the work<br>
of Friedrich Hayek), they might have been<br>
anarcho-capitalists rather than anarcho-socialists. <br>
For example, Felix Guattari noted (see<br>
<a href="http://www.dc.peachnet.edu/~mnunes/guattari.html#p1.6">http://www.dc.peachnet.edu/~mnunes/guattari.html#p1.6</a><br>
) "this left-right split is absolutely evident in<br>
social struggles, in power relations ... But on the<br>
level of thought, it's not at all clear." He then<br>
goes on to cite, for example, how he agrees with<br>
Milton Friedman on the legalization of 'drugs'. <br>
<p>
BTW, the philosophy of D&amp;G is very much a<br>
post-existentialist elaboration of the ideas of<br>
Nietzsche, who is familiar to many Extropians, and<br>
also those of Spinoza (who proclaimed "It is"<br>
compared to Descartes' "I think").<br>

Post-Critical Philosophy_, page 403, originally<br>
published in the 1950s, but still available in a<br>
paperback edition - see<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0226672883/002-6425617-2957633">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0226672883/002-6425617-2957633</a><br>

\6. Having just read Max More's "Pancritical<br>
Rationalism: An Extropic Metacontext for Memetic<br>
Progress" (<a href="http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/pcr.htm">http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/pcr.htm</a>),<br>
I want to note that by "post-critical" I think<br>
Polanyi was referring to the (primarily) French<br>
trends in philosophy to *focus* on criticism as a<br>
*primary* approach, rather than (IMO) any desire to<br>
establish some sort of unassailable foundation.  As<br>
an Extropian, I want to move beyond; still, I feel<br>
some of the same ambiguity toward Polanyi as I feel<br>
towards D&amp;G. Paul Nagy's "Philosophy in a Different<br>
Voice: Michael Polanyi On Liberty And Liberalism"<br>
(<a href="http://www.ch.bme.hu/chemonet/polanyi/9601/philo.html">http://www.ch.bme.hu/chemonet/polanyi/9601/philo.html</a>)<br>
nicely expresses the aspect of Polanyi's conservatism<br>
that I admire: "[Polanyi] was the most moderate of<br>
radicals... What made him differ most from those<br>
around him was his reverence... his attachment to the<br>
perennial enables him to be ahead of his time". <br>
Also, from _Personal Knowledge_, Polanyi warns: "Our<br>
objectivism, which tolerates no open declaration of<br>
faith, has forced modern beliefs to take on implicit<br>
forms..."<br>
