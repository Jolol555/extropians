Hi All,<br>
<p>
The web archive of the list has been down since March 27,<br>
and that is the reason I've not replied to any replies that <br>
may have been made to me, which may not be any, for it seems<br>
that after I defined the bottom-line (just show me an example<br>
of A where A is A free from relation to not-A) the debate <br>
sort of came to a screeching halt. That is the pattern:<br>
I cannot and nobody can find a single example of the<br>
atomist paradigm in existence. This must tell us<br>
something, something critical, something we <br>
cannot dismiss or overlook, something<br>
that maps out a major shortfall <br>
in contemporary wisdom.<br>
<p>
Oh ya, the list... I noticed something worse than the <br>
list being down... the database is scrambled. Check it<br>
out: <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1678.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1678.html</a> <br>
select any message and the page that opens is not the <br>
message you selected. This seems to be endemic. <br>
It did not do this the other day, so I don't<br>
know what the source of the problem is,<br>
maybe it's from my side, but I can't <br>
see how that possibility could be.<br>
<p>
