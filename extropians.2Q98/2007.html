 Methuselah Whales?<br>
<p>
    New research suggests Arctic bowhead whales may live beyond 150 years,<br>
 making them the longest-lived mammals on Earth, writes Ben Spiess in USA<br>
 Today. Since 1981, Inuit whalers have found six harpoon heads in bowhead<br>
 whales that were made of stone or ivory. "The types of points they've<br>
 found in these whales were gone by the 1890s," said archeologist Glenn<br>
 Sheehan. "It's likely these points are from before that - perhaps the<br>
 mid-1800s." In a study of amino-acid aging in bowhead eyes, marine<br>
 chemist Jeffrey Bada of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography found that<br>
 four samples out of 42 were more than 100 years old and one whale was<br>
 estimated to be 180 years old. (His technique, "aspartic acid<br>
 racemization," has a range of error of 12 to 50 years.)<br>
