The SHO master c.c. :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;if you have mread the bible it read that, "over all the world there </i><br>
<i>&gt;came a dark cloud and it rained for fourty days and fourty nights."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now this could be taken in several ways:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. their known world was the middle east.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. it realy rained over the whole world</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. it was wrong?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
There's another possibility here. About 11,000 years ago there was a<br>
huge flood in the Northwest, where the Snake and Columbia rivers are.<br>
A very large lake had formed, dammed by an arm of the glacial ice sheet.<br>
One fine day, the dam broke, and in one day, the coulees were formed.<br>
<p>
A similar event may have happened with the Eurasian ice sheet, along<br>
the series of water bodies (Black Sea, Caspian, Aral) being blocked<br>
and suddenly released. This would create the Flood, and the motion<br>
of such a huge amount of water may have indeed caused considerable<br>
rainfall. <br>
<p>
And (further out), perhaps an asteroid crashed into this lake instead....<br>
