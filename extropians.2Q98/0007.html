By "meaningful" do you mean "nontrivial"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   You just tried to find an</i><br>
<i>&gt;   example of meaningful self-relation and did</i><br>
<i>&gt;   so only by including exactly that which you</i><br>
<i>&gt;   purported need not be a part of relation!</i><br>
<p>
Please pay attention: I explicitly called your attention (once again) to<br>
the distinction between vernacular identity and mathematical identity.<br>
<p>
Also, you're failing to distinguish between two things and two<br>
perceptions of the same thing.  When I say "I believe this cat is the<br>
same as yesterday's cat" what I really mean is "I believe that my<br>
present perception and yesterday's perception are of one and the same<br>
cat" -- not at all that "the two cats are equal".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Also, the cat is always relatied to not-cat.</i><br>
<p>
Everything is related to everything in *some* way.  My quarrel is with<br>
your contention that everything is related to everything (except<br>
possibly itself) in the *same* way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;If I were in a black void and the only thing illuminated were</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a cat, I would say, without looking about for another comparand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"That's Fluffy" (or not, as the case may be).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: Fluffy is being related to the black void!</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Fluffy is DIFFERENT than the black void. How more</i><br>
<i>&gt;   obvious could it be? How more transparent can the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   infection by the "same as" crackpot meme be? It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;   causing you to make the most absurd arguments,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   arguments that defeat themselves by 100%!</i><br>
<p>
Yawn.  Okay, what if there's only the black void?  Can I say that the<br>
black void which I perceive right now is the same black void as the<br>
black void which I perceive right now?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And then there's binocular vision: two perceptions of the same thing at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the same place and time, yet slightly different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: "Slightly different" is still different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Good grief. All your cases against holistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;    identity are actually cases for it!</i><br>
<p>
Please pay attention: two PERCEPTIONS, not two things perceived.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Still wa[i]ting for an example of</i><br>
<i>&gt;    a nonholistic identity.</i><br>
<p>
You'll wait forever, because you reject the DEFINING example, which is<br>
the trivial example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The perfect "same as relation" would be a relation of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; thing to itself, but such a relation is a null relation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Therefore the prevailing atomist definition of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; is false, irrational, an clearly contrary to reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And yet everyone but you finds a use for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: No they don't. They don't know what</i><br>
<i>&gt;   they're doing... confused as you are.</i><br>
<p>
YOU don't know what we're doing.  There's a difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   "Same as" simply defines the "=" symbol.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Is that useful? Yes; but it does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tell us what identity actually is.</i><br>
<p>
By such standards, do we know what *anything* "actually is"?<br>
I'll let you in on a little secret: I don't much care what identity<br>
"actually is", any more than I care what an electron "actually is" --<br>
what interests me is how they behave.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Identity is difference, and difference is holistic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;War is peace.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: If we did not know about good,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   we would not know about bad.</i><br>
<p>
Do you understand the difference between that statement (with which I do<br>
not disagree) and the statement "good is bad"?<br>
