From: "Jonathan Colvin" &lt;jcolvin@ican.net&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sorry, but that is an incredibly facile explanation for religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;origin myths.  Two thousand years ago, when people didn't even</i><br>
<i>&gt;know what stars were, there were many smart people who wondered</i><br>
<i>&gt;why there was something instead of nothing, and why the world was</i><br>
<i>&gt;the way it was.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but people have been wondering this for many hundreds of<br>
thousands of years, or possibly millions, depending on when you<br>
start calling our ancestors people. Either way, clearly the<br>
beginnings of science.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In those days, and even a few hundred years ago, the idea of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;creator was a perfectly rational, metaphysical explanation for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;universe.</i><br>
<p>
A hypothesis, lets see the facts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately for religion, there are now better explanations for</i><br>
<i>&gt;why this world exists (although we are still working on why there</i><br>
<i>&gt;is something rather than nothing).  But dismissing religion as</i><br>
<i>&gt;mindless, unjustified belief does a major disservice to what has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been a central intellectual force in this world up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;beginning of science, a fairly recent phenomenon indeed.</i><br>
<p>
Science has been around as long as man ( L scire, know). Religion<br>
has been one of the least intellectual of forces. But don't take my<br>
word for it, ask Galileo, or Copernicus, or better yet Giordano<br>
Bruno (burned at the stake by the inquisition) The Inquisition,<br>
there were some intellectual giants!!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am an atheist, but having studied the history of science and</i><br>
<i>&gt;religion extensively, I become irritated when religions are</i><br>
<i>&gt;dismissed lightly.  Fundamentalists are loony-tunes.  But science</i><br>
<i>&gt;as we know it today would not have existed without the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Judeo-Christian belief in "rational explanation", which contrasts</i><br>
<i>&gt;greatly with Buddism for example, where the question of origin is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not really considered at all. The first scientists were</i><br>
<i>&gt;theologists, observing the universe around them and trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;explain it.</i><br>
<p>
I too study both the origins of science and religion (patristics)<br>
extensively which is why I haven't the slightest idea where you get<br>
your conclusions. Rational explanation has nothing to do with<br>
"Judeo-Christian" belief for example, and Buddhism most certainly<br>
discusses the question of origin. The first scientists were<br>
theologists? Theologians study theology: the study of God and<br>
religious doctrine, by definition.<br>
