<i>&gt; "rational" in the present context [1], I doubt that there has ever been a </i><br>

<p>
Ok, that statement may have been a bit vague. By rational I mean <br>
"transhumanistsic", see also below. Of course no-one is purely<br>
rational, or rational all the time, but one can be "basically rational".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you meant it in the more </i><br>
<i>&gt; restricted sense of with respect to this issue, then you are wrong by </i><br>
<i>&gt; many orders af magnitude. Based upon the best information known to </i><br>
<i>&gt; them (which is usually very poor), the rational opinion for most people </i><br>
<i>&gt; to have on this subject is either "I don't know whether immortality would </i><br>
<i>&gt; be a good thing", or "I'd like it, but I don't think it's very likely". </i><br>
<p>
So the rational reaction would be to investigate the possibilities (like<br>
we did), instead of staying passive and ignorant. No-one really wants<br>
to be stupid, sick, or grow old and die. Immortality and transcendence<br>
are ancient human dreams, and one of the main reasons why people<br>
have invented religion. What makes transhumanists more rational than<br>
others is that they actively seek the most reliable method(s) to reach that<br>
common human goal, instead of relying on fables, or accepting defeat<br>
without even trying to fight. Because of the more or less common goal,<br>
you *can* say that, for example, transhumanism is superior to religion;<br>
it's a better tool for the job. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; These are both opinions which I've heard expressed or implied quite often </i><br>
<i>&gt; by a wide variety of people.</i><br>
<p>
So have I, but their fault is not their initial ignorance, but their refusal to<br>
listen to sound arguments (let alone to do some research). Even if<br>
you present the facts in the most clear, user friendly, completely<br>
pre-chewed form they still won't listen. That is IMHO stupid.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; [1] It is quite possible to construct a value system which implies </i><br>
<i>&gt; that immortality is a bad idea. If Hayflick's value system is of this </i><br>
<i>&gt; type, then his conclusion is quite rational, although his stated </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasoning is not.</i><br>
<p>
A consistent stupidity is still a stupidity. <br>
