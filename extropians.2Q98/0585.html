<i>&gt; Imaging, as distinct from 'reading' or 'uploading' is already here in</i><br>
<i>&gt; several forms. PET scans, MRI, and CT are well known, and resolution is</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing steadily.</i><br>
<p>
The problem is that the current methods all have rather strong limits<br>
to their resolution (PET is limited by the mean free path for<br>
positrons, MRI by heating of tissue by changing magnetic fields and CT<br>
by the risk of radiation damage). Of course, new methods might (more<br>
likely, *will*) appear, but we cannot say for certain how good imaging<br>
can get. I have a suspicion that it will never become scanning, since<br>
it has to measure the brain from a significant macroscopic distance<br>
(centimeters) while we want data on the micron scale.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem I see here is: Does anyone really know how memories are stored -</i><br>
<i>&gt; is it holographic, physical location, or wiring? </i><br>
<p>
The current model is a bit of all three: memories are stored as<br>
changes in synaptic efficacies across the brain, possibly also the<br>
growth nof new dendrites and synapses. That means they are fairly<br>
non-local, although they are more sensitive to damage to certain<br>
subsystems than others. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is the brain serial or parallel in it's processing?</i><br>
<p>
Parallel, at least when you look at the low-level systems of<br>
perception, movement and memory (fairly natural when you have 10^100<br>
independent neurons active together). High-level cognition might be<br>
more serial, but it is not settled yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How much of the brain's activity is electrical</i><br>
<i>&gt; and how much is chemical, when it comes to actual thought?</i><br>
<p>
They are the same. The signals that rush along neurons are<br>
electrochemical processes where ions move in and out of the cell. At<br>
synapses the signals release neurontransmittors that cause electric<br>
changes in the postsynaptic cell. There are purely chemical processes<br>
and signals, but they seem to act much slower than the electrochemical<br>
signals and hence are unlikely to be part of normal thought.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We are still in the infancy of learning exactly how the brain works...</i><br>
<p>
Indeed. That makes it so fun to study!<br>
