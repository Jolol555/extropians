----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: Max More &lt;maxmore@primenet.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Extropians list will become two lists:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians-Open -- open to everyone, member</i><br>
<i>&gt; and non-member, Extropian, non-Extropian, and anti-Extropian alike. All</i><br>
<i>&gt; topics are open to discussion, including "the basics".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians-Select -- this will be for Extropy Institute members only.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rather than debating the basic values shared by Extropians, the purpose of</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list will be to discuss ideas in depth, to post news items, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; discuss strategies for spreading extropians ideas and for implementing them</i><br>
<i>&gt; in our own lives (life extension, intelligence increase, psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt; improvement, etc.).</i><br>
<p>
A very good solution indeed! That should stop the periodic whining of some<br>
people about S/N... ;-)<br>
<p>
Anyway, I think there's still one type of list missing: "transhumanism select":<br>
an invitation only (or in any case restricted) list for hardcore transhumanists,<br>
where all topics can be discussed without having to think about PR (you<br>
could also call it "&gt;H uncensored"). There have been some concerns <br>
about the effect of certain topics on transhuman PR, and this would solve<br>
the problem without compromising the quality of debate (censorship of<br>
any kind, no matter how reasonable or well-meant, is a killer of critical <br>
debate). The proposed list would also have a restricted (password etc.)<br>
archive, of course.<br>
<p>
(And yes, I know, the  very proposal for such a list is bad PR, but you <br>
can't eat your cake and have it too or something)...In the long run, it<br>
would be better.<br>
<p>
