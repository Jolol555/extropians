 Lately, the song lyrics that stick in my head at work are from Elvis Costello:<br>
<p>
"Everybody knows, that the world is full of stupid people....."<br>
<p>
I sing it when some customer has sent me absolute garbage data and expects me to<br>
wean gold from it....without telling me what format it is in, ascii or ebcdic,<br>
record length, block size, or data density......arrrggghhhh..... I guess they must<br>
think I'm a real wizard to be able to figure this all out ........So I look at it<br>
this way: That I am so smart is what allows me to have such a fun job with no<br>
physical strain or stress..... and make decent money. If everyone were as smart as<br>
me I'd probably have to work hard at a real job..... I'd rather be a big fish over<br>
being an average sized or small fish any day of the week....<br>
