In a message dated 98-05-31 00:28:44 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; On the other hand, here is part of an e-mail message I just received from a<br>
 student:<br>
 _________<br>
 Dear Dr Lewis,<br>
     I was missing 2 more points to get a B grade.  There is anyway that<br>
 you would give me up a B, please.  Because, I am getting scholoship next<br>
 semester.  So would you very please.  Thank you very much Dr. Lewis, U<br>
 really appreciate.  <br>
 _______________<br>
 <br>
 I assume this is a student trying to make a good impression! &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
any chance English is not this students first language?..it has<br>
characteristics that make me suspect this might be the case. if so, it isn't a<br>
reliable indication of his/her abilities, except as regards mastery of<br>
English.  <br>
Cori<br>
