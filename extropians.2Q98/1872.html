color <br>

point <br>

be <br>

to <br>

<i>&gt;On the contrary:  rather, nobody uses metalanguages in day to day</i><br>

of<br>
<i>&gt;thing we'd say.</i><br>
<p>
  Curiously enough, although nobody would do so, this statement would be <br>
acceptable in ordinary lenguage, but is nonsensical in a precise <br>
metalanguage, because of some problems encountered from specifying an <br>
exact time.  I'll make a few more points before I go back to this.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    I like Bart Kosko's notion that Trotskian statements should be </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; assigned a fuzzy truth value.</i><br>
<p>
DF<br>
<i>&gt;NO, and this is where me must take care.  First, I presume you mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;TARSKIAN statements.  ;)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I sometimes get my communists and atomists confused.  They both are <br>
idealists doing battle with an ambigous world.<br>
<p>
  Second, we may say that our INFORMATION is<br>
<i>&gt;imprecise, but the TRUTH is not.  When properly defined, the sky is or </i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;not blue; we may be only 99% certain of its blueness on a clear day at</i><br>
<i>&gt;noon, but that is VERY different from saying that the sky is 99% blue</i><br>
<i>&gt;(again, restricted by our formal metalanguage).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We already quite often say in science that the wavelength of certain </i><br>
light is 550 +/- 10 nm.  This is not to say that the wavelength varies, <br>
but<br>
<i>&gt;that our information is imprecise.  So, to the extent that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary, when we need to make clear how certain we are of something, </i><br>
we will add the precision to which we think we know it. <br>
<p>
This is not a sustainable argument because the more information we had <br>
the weaker this definition of blue would become.  For the moment I am <br>
going to shift the basis of the thought experiment away from the color <br>
of the sky because that is too complex and diffuse; containing all <br>
wavelengths of light to some degree.  Let us presume that a man on the <br>
moon is shining a laser down on our instrumentation, and we are trying <br>
to determine on whether it is a Tarskian truth that 'le laser est bleu'  <br>
Presume that with advanced femtotechnology we have built the most <br>
precise wavelength measuring instrument possible, one that can measure <br>
the wavelength between individual photons being emitted by the laser <br>
down to picometer scale or better.  If the laser is calibrated at 550 nm <br>
the light will certainly fall into the predefined range of blue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We don't need "fuzzy truth" statements: the truth is binary, and we</i><br>
<i>&gt;already have a means of communicating precision.</i><br>
