<i>&gt;Intersexuals are defined chromosomally as neither 'male' nor</i><br>
<i>&gt;'female', some are further defined as 'true hermaphrodites'. Further</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical info can be found at the Intersex Society of North America's</i><br>
<i>&gt;excellent web site: <a href="http://www.isna.org">http://www.isna.org</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Erin was trying to find out if the number of intersex individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt;being born had indeed increased, at least in the US--it's impossible</i><br>
<i>&gt;to say without reviewing every single person's medical records, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;are, of course, confidential.  A Medline search going back into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;early 1980's reveals many surgeons crowing about having found 'true</i><br>
<i>&gt;hermaphrodites', and how they fixed them (grrr....). </i><br>
<p>
In an earlier message you said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;we are most likely cutting off a path of</i><br>
<i>&gt;our own evolution at its source.  </i><br>
<p>
So you cannot be sure whether the number of intersexual babies has increased. But how can you say that it is "most likely" a path of our own evolution?<br>
<p>
In which way would an intersexual be more fit to its (for lack of a better pronoun) environment than its male or female friends? Heterosexuality is a very important concept, both for reproduction and socialization. Zoophilia, homosexuality, pedophilia, all these are likely to have evolutionary origins, but I cannot see a possible use for intersexuality.<br>
<p>
With the very low number of occurances, it appears to me that it is just a "bug", a random mutation. Now you tell me that the bug is actually a feature :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In a few cases, surgery was required to avert a life-threatening condition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but many of these kids were being operated on without the parent's</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge or consent.  The criteria: surgical ease of changing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;'anamolous' genitals to those of a male or female, to hell with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;kid's identity.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
OK, so you believe that the kid's identity is impaired after "fixing" his sexuality. Are there any psychological studies supporting this view? I grant that it is difficult to do such studies if all attempts are blocked because of such "bugfixes".<br>
<p>
Intersexuals are, as described by the ISNA, among other features, characterized by either a small penis or a large clitoris.  Won't these attributes rather lead to isolation? So far you have not presented any evidence that the "fix" is not really a "fix".<br>
<p>
With today's society, it is not at all unlikely that raised intersexuals would end up in modern freak shows or perverted pornos. I think that, in a society with other motives and more tolerance, it would be no problem to integrate intersexual individuals, but in the one we have, it might be one.<br>
