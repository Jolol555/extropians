Attention New York area Objectivists:<br>
<p>
I am posting Don Hauptman's newsflash and review of Ayn Rand's play that <br>
is running in Manhattan through May 29th.<br>
**************************************<br>
OBJECTIVIST THEATER ALERT!<br>
<p>
        NEW YORK, 21 May 1998 -- Today, a friend phoned to inform me that <br>
Ayn Rand's play "Think Twice" is being staged by an off-off-Broadway <br>
company on Theater Row. I didn't think twice, but rushed exactly 20 <br>
blocks south to see the show before its brief run ends.<br>
<p>
        "Think Twice" is no "Atlas Shrugged," but it does have its <br>
moments. An intellectual murder mystery in the tradition of Rand's "Night <br>
of January 16th," it has an ingenious concept and some surprising twists. <br>
<p>
        The problem is that it takes a long time to get there. In the <br>
meanwhile, there's a lot of melodrama and emotional outbursts in a style <br>
that now seems dated. In addition, expect the creaky machinery that's <br>
inevitable in a whodunit, where a lot of dialogue and exposition is <br>
required to give everyone a motive for the crime. Some scenes appear a <br>
bit silly. All of which may explain why the play is so rarely done. <br>
("First time on the New York stage," boasts the show's flier.)<br>
<p>
        Although "Think Twice" would be easy to burlesque, the director <br>
and the company play it straight--fortunately. (Some minor male <br>
characters were recast as female, which didn't appear to affect the <br>
integrity of the production.) The performers are all pros and are <br>
generally quite good. Occasionally, you even get a sense of the <br>
characteristic Randian hero. Everyone involved deserves credit for <br>
carrying off a complex production on a stage the size of a postage stamp.<br>
<p>
        The show is at the Pulse Ensemble Theater, 432 West 42 St., <br>
between 9th and 10th Avenues. The gala opening was May 13th (who knew?), <br>
but a week of performances still remain: Friday, May 22, and next Tuesday <br>
through Friday, May 26-29, all at 8 PM. <br>
<p>
        Tickets are $12. Call Ticket Central 1-8 PM daily at <br>
212-279-4200, or just show up at the box office as I did. Although the <br>
company's director told me she expected a large turnout of Rand admirers, <br>
the marketing and P.R. evidently aren't great and she's still waiting; <br>
the audience tonight was minuscule. I promised her I'd spread the word. <br>
<p>
        Despite my reservations, "Think Twice" delivers a satisfying <br>
ending that's likely to be a genuine surprise if you haven't read the <br>
text in "The Early Ayn Rand." So I recommend that you catch the show if <br>
you can exercise some patience until the payoff. You may not have another <br>
chance to see this rarity. And after all, even second-rate Rand is <br>
preferable to a lot of first-rate everyone else.<br>
<p>
-- Don Hauptman<br>

<i>&gt;From Kirez: I'll be seeing the Thursday night showing, as will Lana and </i><br>
several friends; Ted Keer, Olga Kats, and very probably others. Let me <br>
know if you can join us.<br>
