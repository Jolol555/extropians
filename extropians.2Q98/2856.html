Of the many claims about post-"Breakthrough" technological futures I've<br>
come across, the one that has seemed to me the most outrageously<br>
implausible is Ed Regis's suggestion (following Bernard Williams) that it<br>
would resemble Sunday afternoon in the American suburbs.  The thing I like<br>
least about Jim Halperin's generally fine and very rewarding novels --<br>
especially _FI_ -- is that he provides a vision of the future that comes<br>
close to Regis's suburban singularity.  It is interesting that he manages<br>
to avoid the more plausibly implausible weirdnesses of Vinge, Banks,<br>
Williams, and Nagata by making a few, imho, wildy counter-extropic<br>
stipulations, most conspicuously the ideas that 1, we can keep AI and SI<br>
under wraps by legislative fiat, and 2, that "total honesty" is<br>
technologically enforcable and socially beneficial (not to mention<br>
philosophically coherent in the first place).  I enjoyed Halperin's novels<br>
quite a lot (and of course they make fabulous and sorely needed<br>
immortalist propaganda), but was I alone in thinking that provisos 1 and 2<br>
enabled Halperin to sidestep many of the thornier problems we are likely<br>
to confront in the next five decades?  Best, Dale<br>
