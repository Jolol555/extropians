<p>
That just means that human labor becomes<br>
more valuable, in terms of what can be made.<br>
<p>

<p>
I don't know that a person *can* be "permanently<br>
automated out of a job".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The automation process is accelerating</i><br>
<i>&gt;faster than people are capable of re-training.  </i><br>
<p>
I don't see any reason to think that this is the case,<br>
since *I* retrained, last year, from being a<br>
factory worker to being a network administrator.<br>
It isn't even very difficult to change, for someone<br>
who is already minimally keeping up.  If a person<br>
isn't, then it's that person's own planning that is<br>
problematic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So as you said, if you are not </i><br>
<i>&gt;suggesting that people become </i><br>
<i>&gt;superfluous what are they going </i><br>
<i>&gt;to do to survive besides begging </i><br>
<i>&gt;or stealing.  If you can't answer </i><br>
<i>&gt;this with adequate demonstration, </i><br>
<i>&gt;then you have yet to meet the </i><br>
<i>&gt;challenge that I proposed at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;very beginning of this thread.</i><br>
<p>
I cannot give any general proof, but<br>
it doesn't seem to me that there is <br>
any problem, now or in the next ten<br>
to fifteen years, with retraining to do<br>
whatever needs doing.  Part of the<br>
difficulty here is that we seem to <br>
have different ideas of how automation<br>
is going to appear in the economy.<br>
With macroscale automation, much<br>
of it will be of the type that McDonald's<br>
is installing this year, that is, automation<br>
designed to improve the product, but <br>
which doesn't put anyone out of a job,<br>
as long as they can adapt to the new<br>
paradigm.  I don't think we will see<br>
vast percentages of the economy<br>
becoming automated before the<br>
arrival of molecular manufacturing,<br>
and that can be small enough that<br>
everyone can have their own <br>
manufacturing facility for almost <br>
anything.<br>
