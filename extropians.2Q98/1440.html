<i>&gt;Have you got any starting points for non-physics majors? I am an </i><br>
engineer,<br>
<i>&gt;but not a mathematician. If the discussion is not too heavy into pure </i><br>
math,<br>
<i>&gt;I would enjoy it.</i><br>

We could look at from this point of view. You being an engineer would <br>
certaintly understand the stipulations time travel would have upon a <br>
spacecraft and keeping it together let alone travel for that distance at <br>
such a speed(close to light). If a man were to travel for one year under <br>
these circumstances, 1500 years approximately would pass here on earth. <br>
Einstein believed that a clock on the spaceship would appear to be <br>
moving much slower than here on earth. lets say we engaged a time travel <br>
experiment for the pilot to travel 10 years, 5 years to one point in <br>
space and 5 back, if the pilot left earth on january 1st, 2000, he would <br>
arrive back on earth january 1st,17,000! The pilot would only be 10 <br>
years older, yet the world would be completely different, and probably <br>
the climate would be something he couldnt adjust to with the rate of <br>
global warming as it is, and therefore have a "few" surprises for him <br>
when he got home. These are just a few ideas, popular theories actually <br>
that can be read presently. actually the global warming part is my <br>
opinion so for all i know the pilot may have nothing to worry about, but <br>
im a firm believer in evolution and believe that if 15,000 years go <br>
humans will adjust to many many things that we would not be able to <br>
handle in one large spurt presently.<br>
