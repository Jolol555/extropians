<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    2 and 3 are holist in nature since they say</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    that what A is depends upon something that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    A is not, and thus they are not atomist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is completely invalid.  They are "not atomist" by YOUR definiton of</i><br>
<i>&gt;atomism, which is the very subject under debate!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: "My definition" of atomism is the Three <br>
  Law of Thought. The Three Laws of Thought are <br>
  not properly defined as "my definition." <br>
<p>
  Your definition is new and IS properly defined<br>
  as "your definition," which redefines atomism<br>
  in a holist context by adding "with respect to."<br>
<p>
  You're REdefining the standard then you're <br>
  portraying the standard as my definition that <br>
  is totally my own and is unlike what most <br>
  people use. That is the opposite of the truth.<br>
<p>
  The 3 Laws define a crisp boundary around A<br>
  that says the identity of A is exclusive to A<br>
  by 100%. Adding to A is A "with respect to 0"<br>
  turns atomism into a holistic relation.<br>
<p>
  That such relation is the truth does not mean it <br>
  is atomism. You've assumed "atomism" = "truth."<br>
<p>
  That you attempt to show examples of relations <br>
  that are what they are free from other relations,<br>
  means your saying that relation-A is A free from<br>
  -A, and thus you still deploy the very traditional<br>
  atomist definition that you seek to redefine.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    I agree that half of the difference is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    half of the difference, and half defines</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    the whole by default. If I give you $50 </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    and say this is half of the fee, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    identity of the whole fee is revealed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    so the ID of the whole is in the half.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    The area just outside the letter A defines </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    it as much as the area inside the letter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Its identity contains both areas.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My point is that most people define the fee differently, such that if I</i><br>
<i>&gt;tell you that "this is only part of the fee" you STILL know the identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;of what I've given you.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: You'll know it still by its relation to external <br>
  features. Your trying to say that A is A free from <br>
  not-A even as you try to redefine atomism not to <br>
  say that. Just ask yourself, why is it necessary <br>
  for you to add the words "with respect to 0" to<br>
  the 3 Laws? What do they change? What do they stop?<br>
  They stop the clearly stated definition of atomism,<br>
  the definition that you continue to attempt to use<br>
  by arguing that relation-A is A free from -A.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: When I refer to the high, I refer to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    the low by default;  when I refer to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    good, I refer to the bad by default...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    How is it that I don't refer to the whole?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Simple:  you have made the dualistic fallacy.  Sure, in a universe</i><br>
<i>&gt;consisting of only two objects, by looking at both you observe the whole. </i><br>
<i>&gt;However, when you look at a universe with THREE objects, observing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship between two is NOT looking at the whole, but is nonetheless</i><br>
<i>&gt;valid as a partial diffrerence.  Our definitions disagree in that atomists</i><br>
<i>&gt;define that identity comes from the relationship between the object in</i><br>
<i>&gt;question and another object which is defined to have no identity called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"0."  (Let me stop you before you start.  0 has no identity because there</i><br>
<i>&gt;is no difference between 0 and 0.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Then 1 also has no identity because <br>
   there is no difference between 1 and 1.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Under your definition of identity, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;does not define the identity of 0.  I'm aware of that.  I'm CHALLENGING</i><br>
<i>&gt;your definition.  Do not use it to defend your argument, use ANOTHER</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition to defend your DEFINITION.)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Your redefining atomism to be holism.<br>
   A relation is a holism. A universe with 3 <br>
   things defines 1 thing as 1 of 3. I've <br>
   already shown how your example of two <br>
   things relating to zero is holism by <br>
   100% since the changing relation was <br>
   change relative to the not-change.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The identity of A is defined as the difference between itself and the 0; </i><br>
<i>&gt;while we could then go on to observe 0's relationship to B, and then draw</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclusions about the relationship between A and B (if we knew what B</i><br>
<i>&gt;was!), the relationship between B and A does not define the identity of</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything.  Only the difference between A and 0 defines A's identity under</i><br>
<i>&gt;this definition.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: A may be larger, faster,... than B, <br>
   and yes, all with respect to 0. Just observe<br>
   that 3 is 5 relative to -2 and we see that <br>
   non-zero identities acquire identity attributes<br>
   from non-zero identities... as well as from 0.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    IAN: Not true. "Net difference" is not a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    violation of the definition of difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    I say that the difference between 4 and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    5 is expressed as 4 - 5 = -1. That's the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    standard definition. So saying that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    net difference is -1 &amp; 1, is not unique;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    observing that it is the holisitc struc-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    ture of identity is unique.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This not an observation, it is a definition.  I could just as easily</i><br>
<i>&gt;define identity to be only the partial difference and make just as much</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense.  I'm telling you that this is what atomists do, and that is why</i><br>
<i>&gt;holists and atomists are both right, by virtue of the fact that they agree</i><br>
<i>&gt;100%.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: But half is not free from the whole,<br>
   and the cause of the half is the whole.<br>
