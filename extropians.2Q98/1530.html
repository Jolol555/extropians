Its been a while since we've discussed concrete scenarios of technological,<br>
economic, social and political development.  The last couple of years have<br>
brought some dramatic news items on the technological front, and also perhaps<br>
some continuing confirmation of trends that have been operating for some time.<br>
These developments and continuing trends may have shaped or changed our views<br>
of the near term.<br>
<p>
I'm curious about list members' views of probable and possible developments<br>
over the next twenty years and think a more or less focused discussion might<br>
be enlightening.  I'd like to start a thread here for discussion of specific<br>
trends and developments and their impact on daily life and the "big picture",<br>
with special emphasis on matters of interest to transhumans and extropians.<br>
I'd like to solicit specific predictions for the 20 years beginning in 2000,<br>
perhaps in 5-year increments. I'm particularly interested in folks that may<br>
have a specialist's insight into particular technologies or social phenomena,<br>
but would also like to solicit general discussion of interaction of specific<br>
developments and general trends.  With that introduction, I offer the<br>
following outline as a framework for discussion (I'm sure I've left out some<br>
key technology or social issue . . .):<br>
