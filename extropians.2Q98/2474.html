That is essentially the same thing that Penrose seems to believe (minus the<br>
God bit).  Also, Occam's razor is merely a guide, and cannot have<br>
explanatory force.<br>

  For too long, the "Big Bang" theory of creation has reigned supreme,<br>
despite glaring meta-cosmological problems, and has been complacently<br>
accepted.  It is now becoming clear that there is much beyond the Big Bang.<br>
Let me be clear...I do not believe in God or a created universe.  Hpwever, a<br>
few forward-looking cosmologists speculate that we will eventually be able<br>
to create baby universes in the laboratory.  Is it too much of a stretch to<br>
think that we could eventually create a universe with initial conditions<br>
fitting for life (even though we could never access it)?  Then the last<br>
laugh will be on creationists, for at that point, we will be "God" (although<br>
not the sort of God that they envisage).<br>
