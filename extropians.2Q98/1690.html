Was: ExI = Truth First ?<br>

<i>&gt;Unfortunately, I must seriously disagree with you, as treating truth</i><br>

<p>
<p>
   IAN: I agree with you, I was stating the <br>
   above in the process of defining the case <br>
   I was countering, that truth is subjective.<br>
   Your point about contract law is excellent.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   I believe that we can have a scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   definition of truth (a one-one or maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   onto function, or both) that eliminates</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   in one fell swoop this morass of subjec-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   tive truth,  which I think is a direct</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   threat to science and ethical standards</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   as this leads to a "utility first" frame-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   work that leads to "anything goes."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, this is the whole reason behind what is termed by many conservatives</i><br>
<i>&gt;as the 'degradation' of society. If everything is subjective, as liberals</i><br>
<i>&gt;are wont to establish as a societal truth, then anything goes. </i><br>
<p>
   IAN: Exactly, and...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;THe resulting destabilization causes people to prefer more authoritarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;statist measures to return society to 'normalcy'. This is not an accident.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Creating dissafected classes is essential to generating support for</i><br>
<i>&gt;authoritarian statist measures in any society, which is a central strategy</i><br>
<i>&gt;of terrorists and subversive groups in order to generate general sentiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;for their goals, as increasing authoritarian repression of dissafected</i><br>
<i>&gt;classes is essential to creating the atmosphere for a general uprising.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is standard strategy taught in ChiCom, bolshevik, and other nihilist</i><br>
<i>&gt;guerrilla schools.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I also have wondered if the "watering down"<br>
   of truth is not part of such a totalitarian agenda,<br>
   or, gasp, "conspiracy." Maybe and maybe not, it may<br>
   be taking the issue to a level that's not totally<br>
   necessary in the ground level rebuttal of subjec-<br>
   tive "there is no reliable truth" paradigms.<br>
<p>
   Thinking on this issue has made me realize the <br>
   "ungrounding" that can take place to the extent<br>
   that a "no reliable truth" standard takes over.<br>
   I see this standard approaching on every front.<br>
   If you could lead a population to believe that <br>
   truth is subjective and there is  no reliable<br>
   truth, they'd be severed from the ability to <br>
   engage in rational thought and thus prevented<br>
   from independent thought and analysis of the<br>
   the things that their leaders tell them.<br>
<p>
   But rather than this being a conspiracy, I <br>
   think it may be more of an expression of the <br>
   fluid nature of scientific discovery, perhaps<br>
   nowhere more notably than in quantum physics.<br>
   The nature of the new findings and the rate <br>
   of redefining old standards may foster just<br>
   the atmosphere necessary for a "no reliable<br>
   truth" paradigm meme to suddenly spread.<br>
<p>
   In fact, I've had some strong reactions from<br>
   the "right-wing conspiracy-theory camp" after<br>
   I wrote an essay on TWA 800 and fuzzy logic.<br>
   The idea was expressed that fuzzy logic was<br>
   a conspiracy of the elite to destroy truth <br>
   and thereby undermine traditional values.<br>
   But that is just irrational paranoia based <br>
   on total confusion of what fuzzy logic is. <br>
   Fuzzy simply observes that WORDS do not al-<br>
   ways map onto the physical reality by 100%.<br>
   Fuzzy logic increases analytical accuracy<br>
   and is there an aid to rational thinking.<br>
