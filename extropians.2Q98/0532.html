<i> &gt; Has anyone heard of a new use of MRI technology which can be used to</i><br>
<i> &gt; modulate the visual cortex? Its a rumor that sounds like super fringe</i><br>
<i> &gt; science, but I'd like to hear if there's any truth to it.</i><br>
<p>
This might well be true. A high-Tesla research MRI imager is a pretty<br>
interesting thing. Particularly the very high field intensity in a<br>
large coil aperture distinguishes it strongly from other mainstream<br>
cryomagnet applications, as e.g. NMR spectrocopy. While it won't let you<br>
levitate in field gradients as frogs and waterdrops can do, you should <br>
not be moved rapidly because we are an electrolyte bag.<br>
<p>
Also, the RF power deposited is noticeable, and, together with certain <br>
pulse sequences can mean bad things to obese patients. One should be<br>
able to induce potential differences, but the voxel size should be<br>
pretty large. Meaning, tweaking being likely coarse.<br>
