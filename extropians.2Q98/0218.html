<i>&gt; First off, if you follow the url about Gary North, Hal Finney recently</i><br>
<i>&gt; posted, you'll find that he does NOT believe in an impending second</i><br>
<i>&gt; coming or revelations predicted apocalypse. In fact, he chides</i><br>
<i>&gt; christians who rather than attempting to solve social problems, just</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignore them and say that jesus is coming. While I am wary of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; religiosity of sources, his brand of christianity is much less annoying</i><br>
<i>&gt; to me than the millenialists who he is accused of belonging to. One</i><br>
<i>&gt; poster accused North of outright fabrication on his web site. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; check it out, you'll see that the heart of his site is LINKS to other</i><br>
<i>&gt; sources, many of them with very different views than his, plus editorial</i><br>
<i>&gt; comment on the sources. I would like to see one specific lie brought to</i><br>
<i>&gt; light as an example.</i><br>
<p>
I read www.garynorth.com regularly.  It is a good source of information,<br>
but you have to take it with a grain of salt, realize that he is filtering<br>
the data and may be presenting it in misleading ways.  Someone pointed<br>
for example to <a href="http://www.garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/1260">http://www.garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/1260</a>, which<br>
North characterizes as a banker testifying about the threat caused by<br>
the collapse of the telecommunications system.  If you follow the link<br>
to the original talk at <a href="http://www.house.gov/banking/2598acb.htm">http://www.house.gov/banking/2598acb.htm</a> you<br>
will see that North provided an out of context quote which was inserted<br>
as a caveat in a talk which otherwise discussed positive efforts to<br>
address Y2K problems.  The speaker has no particular knowledge about<br>
telecommunications (he is addressing banking issues) and was simply<br>
pointing out that the banks were relying on the phone system continuing<br>
to work.  If all you did was read North's synopsis you would have<br>
come away with a false impression of the thrust of the talk.  So it's<br>
important to follow the pointers and not just read North's excerpts,<br>
and also to realize that North is going to focus on bad news.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another concern was the nature of the posters on certain y2k forums. Try</i><br>
<i>&gt; comp.software.year-2000. A large number of very experienced mainframe</i><br>
<i>&gt; and other programmers, many working on y2k issues, post there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Admittedly, you also get Paul Milne, a non programmer who paints some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the scariest post y2k scenarios, and is annoyingly christian (though</i><br>
<i>&gt; again, not of the millenialist variety). </i><br>
<p>
This is a much more balanced forum than North's and Yourdon's BBS's.  You<br>
will find many experienced engineers who can put the problems into<br>
perspective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And Hal also took a cheap shot at Ed Yourdon. Check out his</i><br>
<i>&gt; bio(somewhere on www.yourdon.com) and you'll see he has quite the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reputation to risk. Is he supposed to work for free?</i><br>
<p>
Yourdon is selling his book and his Y2K consulting services.  He has a<br>
financial interest in making the problem look bad.  No one is going to<br>
buy the book and consulting if he tells them that Y2K probably isn't<br>
going to be much of an issue.  You have to keep this kind of thing in<br>
mind when you read his stuff.  Also take a look at<br>
<a href="http://www.albany.net/~dmills/fallback/fintro.htm">http://www.albany.net/~dmills/fallback/fintro.htm</a> (follow the links at<br>
the bottom) where a power engineer criticizes some of the claims made<br>
in the Yourdons' book.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For a view from</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone with a great deal of credibility in the markets and finance, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; also has y's r's d's and an n in his name, check out Ed Yardeni's y2k</i><br>
<i>&gt; links on his site www.yardeni.com. He is the chief economist of nyc</i><br>
<i>&gt; investment firm Deutsche Morgan Greunfell.</i><br>
<p>
Yardeni predicts that we could see a serious recession due to the<br>
Y2K problem.  I agree that this is a real danger, as I posted before.<br>
My main beef is with the apocalyptics like North who see it as the end<br>
of Western civilization.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Read the links at garynorth.com regarding the IRS, and you'll see that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they're not even in the ballpark for having any kind of meaningful fix</i><br>
<i>&gt; in time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And the fed printing up lots of cash to keep the banks from having to</i><br>
<i>&gt; close, will only work till 01/03/2000 at best.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Can someone please find an example of one fortune 2000 company that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; even claiming to be fixed. Or one government above the county level.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tenessee is 70-80 percent done, but they started before almost every</i><br>
<i>&gt; state - around 1990, I think, and most are still not actually fixing</i><br>
<i>&gt; code. How about one major utility or telco? How bout any organization</i><br>
<i>&gt; with over 20 million lines of code to fix.</i><br>
<p>
Many organizations will have problems.  But just because an organization<br>
can't certify that it is Y2K compliant doesn't mean that it is going<br>
to fail.  The first order of business is to identify mission critical<br>
components and work on fixing them.  Then you go on to less critical<br>
items.  When the millennium comes, if some things fail you may have to<br>
do some workarounds, but things can keep going.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The electric utility industry looks to be screwed. Check out what Rick</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cowles, the head of Digital's y2k utilities section, has to say at</i><br>
<i>&gt; www.euy2k.com</i><br>
<p>
Cowles is selling a Y2K book from his site.  He is making money off the<br>
problem.  That gives him a potential bias.  Read the link I provided<br>
above for information about how the power grid is designed to keep<br>
working in the face of failures.  Also see the posting here by someone<br>
knowledgable about nuclear plants debunking the fear of Y2K errors<br>
putting them off line.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And let's not forget the y2k errors found in nuclear weapons, admitted</i><br>
<i>&gt; to recently by Clinton's newly appointed y2k czar, John Koskinen. He</i><br>
<i>&gt; said something to the effect that while there is a small chance that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they may actually accidentaly fire, they are more likely to fail safe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But even that destabilizes the balance of terror. Now, the world's</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear powers have to wonder whether theirs and others' missiles now</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a "best if used by date" on them of 01/01/2000.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not a nuclear expert, but I believe these weapons are loaded with<br>
fail safes and are not in a position to go off accidentally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; About resetting clocks to 1972, that is a clever fix for a very small</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of systems. Most embeddeds have no way for the user to change the</i><br>
<i>&gt; date, and dos/windows machines can't handle dates before 1980.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting assertion: One third of business software source code is</i><br>
<i>&gt; missing</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting assertion 2: The embedded situation may be twice the size of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mainframe y2k problem, but awareness and planning is about where it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was for mainframes 2 years ago.</i><br>
<p>
It's relatively easy to identify embedded systems that could have date<br>
vulnerabilities.  They generally require some mechanism to reset the<br>
date in the event that power is lost (since any clock requires power).<br>
So there is little chance that embedded systems will surprise people by<br>
turning out unexpectedly to have Y2K problems.<br>
<p>
There are date sensitive embedded systems in some specific applications,<br>
and testing and fixing those is going to be a big job.  But I've seen<br>
simplistic figures suggesting that 5% of all embedded systems have Y2K<br>
vulnerabilities, and there doesn't seem to be much evidence for this.<br>
Not much is known yet about the scope of the embedded system problem,<br>
but more information is coming out this year as testing continues.<br>
