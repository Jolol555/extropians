At 05:39 AM 4/4/98 +1000, you wrote:<br>

<p>
If you just take away private property, then the government, who is no more<br>
required to be benevolent than Bill Gates, has precisely the same magical<br>
powers.  This is not theory, this is fact.  Slaughters just like the kind<br>
you're proposing have taken place at the hands of authoritarian governments<br>
countless times throughout history.  Abolishing private property does not<br>
alleviate this problem; it makes it much much worse.<br>
<p>
So I presume you mean to topple the state, too...  But if you try the<br>
revolutionary tactic many anarcho-socialists suggest, the general consensus<br>
is that people will be only MORE likely to embrace totalitarianism.<br>
Revolution is dangerous and chaotic.  People beg for strong leadership<br>
during these periods...  we'll *definitely* be right back where we started,<br>
because there won't be ANYTHING to stop it, not even the possibility of a PPA.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not trying to hold anarchists to anything.  I consider myself</i><br>
<i>&gt;an anarchist, in the more traditional use of the word</i><br>
<i>&gt;(anarcho-socialists).  I was just pointing out the, what i think are,</i><br>
<i>&gt;extensive simmilarities between the current system and PPA based</i><br>
<i>&gt;anarcho-capitalism as you described it, and the big power that one man</i><br>
<i>&gt;could wield over a large part of the population in this supposedly</i><br>
<i>&gt;decentralised system.  The holocaust or the inquisition could just as well</i><br>
<i>&gt;happen as with the current nation-states, the main difference being that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the new megalomaniac's great quality would be having heaps of property.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't see the case i described of bill gates or some other billionaire of</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to wipe a part of the population as any more far-fetched than that</i><br>
<i>&gt;of some german thinking that jews are evil and trying to wipe off that</i><br>
<i>&gt;portionof the population.  Great wealth is not a certificate of sanity.</i><br>
<p>
No, you're right, it's not a certificate of sanity.  Neither is holding a<br>
public office, sadly.<br>
<p>
But consider this, Mr. left-anarchist.  Remember Bakunin?  (Hint:  Don't<br>
eliminate money to make the state fall away, eliminate the state and let<br>
MONEY fall away.)  Anarcho-socialist communes, group societies, etc. could<br>
all exist, live and thrive under anarcho-capitalism.  If they're more<br>
prosperous than a capitalist system, they will even be more abundant than<br>
the PPA system.  <br>
<p>
If you support a society with no state and no private property, you should<br>
eliminate the state first, in a slow, peaceful manner; then, if you're<br>
right, private property should fall away as the more efficient and<br>
generally superior socialist communes spread like wild fire.<br>
<p>
So would you at least consider looking at anarcho-capitalism in the same<br>
way that true communists wanted to look at authoritarian socialism, as an<br>
intermediary step towards the final goal?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;huh?  what's that got to do with the price of fish?  I wasn't trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;say that bill gates wanted to wipe India off the planet, just that some</i><br>
<i>&gt;person with wealth y would want to do something disagreeable to  x people</i><br>
<i>&gt;with income z, where x is very large but y &gt; x*z, and him/her being able</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do this rather easily under the proposed system.</i><br>
<p>
Under anarcho-capitalism slaughter is harder than it is now; but if it's<br>
really really easy now, then there's not quite as much we can do about it.<br>
Anarcho-socialism won't help this, either, sadly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And for reasons i explained earlier it is very likely it WOULD win, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;more likely, that no war would occur, </i><br>
<i>&gt;or that if there was a war and it didn't then you wouldn't come out any</i><br>
<i>&gt;better. i've already stated it twice.  check my response to Dan Fabulich's</i><br>
<i>&gt;posts.</i><br>
<p>
Again, your conception of the situation was completly incorrect.  Say my<br>
PPA (PPA-1) decided to become tyrannical.  PPA-2, we agree, will interfere<br>
only if it will earn them a profit; they will win only if they make more<br>
profit than PPA-1 would otherwise.  In light of this, I offer PPA-2<br>
slightly MORE than I used to pay PPA-1, and I refuse to pay PPA-1.  From<br>
there, PPA-2 has the means and the incentive to protect me from PPA-1.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;i didn't claim that.  Stalin is not exactly the average guy in a position</i><br>
<i>&gt;of power right now.  That Bill Gates under PPA anarcho-capitalism (PPAAC?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;would have more influence than John Howard (Australia's PM, just in case)</i><br>
<i>&gt;has right now, i would say most definitely.</i><br>
<p>
John Howard is a poor choice...  A better choice would be someone like the<br>
head of the Australian military, who, we imagine, actually could take over<br>
the country given his position.  Howard could not do this.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the point is this:  Yes, Bill Gates would have a lot of power under<br>
A-C, but there are plenty of people who wield incredible powers today<br>
(military generals, etc.) who have no checks on their power.  No system of<br>
political checks and balances can overcome this; so long as the military<br>
exists, it can simply choose to reject the laws set down by the politicians<br>
and take over the country.  Anarcho-capitalism is the only way to even sort<br>
of begin to limit the effects of this power, by allowing people to choose<br>
between competing protection agencies, rather than being stuck with just one.<br>
<p>
And that's a good thing.<br>
