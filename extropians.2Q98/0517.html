I would say nanotech.<br>
<p>
BUT not in the advanced form consisting of tiny robots.<br>
<p>
U/Ling may arrive but like so many technological advances, I'd predict<br>
its arrival as a sudden fit of technological evolution, not as a<br>
graduated science.<br>
<p>
Has anyone heard of a new use of MRI technology which can be used to<br>
modulate the visual cortex? Its a rumor that sounds like super fringe<br>
science, but I'd like to hear if there's any truth to it.<br>
<p>
Anyhow, regarding the original question. The question seemed to be<br>
focused on the singularity, and since the first nano tech will probably<br>
not satisfy this function, I'd say the first singularity-oriented<br>
advance will most likely be U/Ling..<br>
<p>
<p>
My opinion isn't based on science, just an over active imagination.<br>
