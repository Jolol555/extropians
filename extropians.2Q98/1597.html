<i>&gt;&gt;Completely, just think what would happen if the world transfered its money</i><br>
from the military to other things.  There are benefits though, like the<br>
military spends a lot of money on research.&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
couldn't a civilian group spend the money just as well?..;-)<br>
<p>
seriously, i was thinking that a large factor in the high cost is the simple<br>
fact that many if not most of the items discussed on this list; augmentation,<br>
cloning, tissue regeneration, space exploration and colonization, etc.. are of<br>
value to a very small number of people...or rather the majority of folks seem<br>
to feel that way... that is to say that it seems very few can or will see the<br>
possible long term benefits of R &amp; D in such areas...if only we had the same<br>
sort of ad campaigns as used to sell shoes and candy and jeans and.....<br>
