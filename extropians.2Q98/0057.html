What that says to me is that even in its worst case scenario,<br>
anarcho-capitalism would result in a nation state.  I conclude that we have<br>
little to lose, in that case.<br>

<p>
Other PPAs, as I said elsewhere.  Moreover, they will back your ability to<br>
choose, not because it is morally right, but because this ability is<br>
valuable to customers; they will therefore be willing to pay for it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They would do this if 1) they can get you out of your own PPA's control,</i><br>

<p>
And why would either of these be false?<br>
