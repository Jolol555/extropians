At 02:22 PM 5/17/98 -0700, you wrote:<br>

<i>&gt;I don't mean to jump on your case specifically.  Its just that this thread</i><br>
has<br>

haven't<br>
<i>&gt;bother reading what I wrote, and then presuming that I am so kind of dogged</i><br>
<i>&gt;socialist proposing a centralized governmental body to re-distribute the</i><br>
wealth.<br>
<i>&gt;This is simply not the case.</i><br>
<p>
I am guilty of an occasional knee-jerk, and would like to discipline myself<br>
away form jumping to conclusions. I did not, however, get the feeling that<br>
you were proposing central control. I can't see the present forms of<br>
government surviving unchanged once everyone can build a nanocomputer on<br>
their desktop. Once the present system of wages dies off, how will they<br>
justify their continued existance? Without being able to steal from<br>
worker's wages, how will they fuel themselves?<br>
<p>
This is probably too rosy an outlook. There is nothing quite as cunning as<br>
a cornered bureaucrat..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem I'm trying to reconcile is the elegance of the free market</i><br>
combined<br>
<i>&gt;with increasing automation.  Obviously, once we reach the assembler</i><br>
breakthrough<br>
<i>&gt;this whole issue becomes moot. Money and work become meaningless in a</i><br>
world where<br>
<i>&gt;you can replicate anything you need.  My concern is for the *transition*</i><br>
leading<br>
<i>&gt;up to it.  I see those years as ones where large segments of the economy</i><br>
become<br>
<i>&gt;increasingly automated.  Jobs safe from automation until nanotech would</i><br>
probably<br>
<i>&gt;include - doctors, engineers, scientists, artists, programmers, consultants,</i><br>
<i>&gt;advisors, lawyers, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
That is also my problem. Once everything settles out, life on Earth may<br>
approach some sort of leisure paradise. The transition is genuinely scary.<br>
So far, we have pretty much dodged the bullet in industries like steel and<br>
automobiles - there have been thousands of workers let go; in most cases<br>
they were able to find other work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The question is can blue collar/joe-sixpack adapt to the changing</i><br>
workforce by<br>
<i>&gt;becoming a knowledge worker?  I have my doubts.  Also, I believe much of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;service sector will become automated.  One secretary does today what it took</i><br>
<i>&gt;dozens only 30 years ago.  This trend in office automation is continuing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Also in engineering! When I started in the industry in 1979, even<br>
supertechs had access to file clerks and secretaries who typed up reports,<br>
etc. By the time I finished school, the engineer was expected to do his own<br>
filing and typing, and in some cases, purchasing for production. One<br>
company I worked at also had the engineering staff taking service calls and<br>
closing sales. (All this while being expected to turn out product faster..)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, some interesting counter-proposals from others on the list included</i><br>
<i>&gt;pointing out that the service sector will continue because of a high</i><br>
demand for<br>
<i>&gt;'human touch'. Although each company will need less people to do the same</i><br>
thing,<br>
<i>&gt;there will be more companies doing it. Dan Fabulich pointed out that with</i><br>
<i>&gt;increasing automation comes increased production at lower costs.  So although</i><br>
<i>&gt;wages will decrease, the price of goods will decrease even more rapidly,</i><br>
thereby<br>
<i>&gt;raising the living standard for everybody.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Paul Hughes</i><br>
<p>
I, too, believe that there will always be a place for services and retail,<br>
at least until everyone downloads into cyberspace..If we can play the cards<br>
out right, perhaps we can avoid the huge disruptions and chao some have<br>
postulated..<br>
