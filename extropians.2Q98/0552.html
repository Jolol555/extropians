The recent discussion about pets let me to thinking about bodhisattvas and their <br>
transhuman counterparts. For those who know even less of Budhism than I, (any <br>
Buddhists out there should correct any errors on my behalf here) a bodhisattvas <br>
is a being that has gained all of the necessary knowledge and/or wisdom to <br>
transcend and become a Buddha but declines to do so out of compassion.  Buddhas<br>
rarely interact with mere mortals, and so a bodhisattvas delays his own <br>
transcendence so as to be in a position to help encourage the transcendence of <br>
others.<br>
<p>
The parallel with technotranscendence is clear. We talk about uplifting dogs and <br>
octopi here, but seldom about doing so for amoeba or rotifers. Creatures <br>
sufficiently far down the complexity ladder from us just don't seem worth it. <br>
The same may be true for a Power. After a while humans might not seem worth the <br>
effort to aid/uplift anymore. <br>
<p>
A Power might decide to temporarily halt its trancendence when it <br>
feels its abilities relate to humans as ours do to dogs. At that point it <br>
could still care (although WE might find it hard to understand its actions) and <br>
might work to uplift us towards its abilities.<br>
<p>
More likely (in my mind) is for a Power, able to perform distributed <br>
multi-node processing, to spawn a whole series of intermediate versions of <br>
itself to form a ladder of trancendence. Each would be a minor processing node <br>
of the Power (a sattva?), and each would have a complexity relation with those <br>
'above' and 'below' it on the ladder such that communication is just possible <br>
and/or worthwhile.<br>
<p>
If you want a selfish reason for doing such a thing, it could be observed that <br>
the space of possible transcended beings is probably immense. By leaving behind <br>
a trail, a Power makes it easier for others to follow it, and be guided such <br>
that they arrive at the Power's level as allies rather than enemies.<br>
<p>
So, what do folks think, goofy idea, or not?<br>
