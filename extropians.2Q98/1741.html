&lt;&lt; If Hitler had stayed home and set up death camps, would the world community<br>
 of the day have stepped in to do something about it? After all, he would<br>
 not have been directly affecting any other nation's borders or peoples. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
seems highly doubtful, given the recent cases of such genocide in Rwanda and<br>
other areas... the mass murder of Jews, Gypsies, Socialists, Homosexuals and<br>
others persecuted by the Nazis did not cause WWII.  while Hitlers anti-<br>
Semitism certainly played a large part in his strategic thinking, the causes<br>
of the war were many and included the economic situation and the blow to<br>
Germany's pride delivered by the treaty ending WWI...<br>
