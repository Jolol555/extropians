<i>&gt; &gt; I am interested in getting information about the Oceania project</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that ceased a while back.  It was, as I recall, intended as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; start of a libertarian country.  While the project failed financially,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I am interested in contacting the person involved.  Does anybody know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who he is and/or how that can be done?</i><br>
<p>
I just received this exciting news from The First Millennial Foundation<br>
(FMF):<br>
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
From: Phil Kopitske &lt;kopit002@maroon.tc.umn.edu&gt;<br>
<p>
Hi everybody!<br>
<p>
I just got off the phone with Robert Nicholson of Sea Solar<br>
Power in York, PA.  I called him to invite him to speak at<br>
our conclave on Saturday August 1st.  He agreed to give a<br>
talk covering the design of the SSP 10 MW shore-based OTEC,<br>
and the progress that SSP has made in lining up $40 Million<br>
in venture capital to build the plant and to get an actual<br>
contract for what will be the first commercial closed cycle<br>
OTEC.<br>
<p>
I want all you engineers and long-suffering members out there<br>
to seriously consider attending the conclave, because SSP HAS<br>
JUST GOTTEN A CONTRACT TO BUILD THEIR FIRST 10 MW OTEC!  This is<br>
earth-shattering news because THE FMF HAS BEEN INVITED TO<br>
WORK WITH SSP TO BUILD AND STAFF THE COMMERCIAL MARICULTURE and AQUAPONICS<br>
FACILITIES THAT WILL ACCOMPANY THIS 10 MW OTEC!<br>
<p>
I cannot overstate the significance of this first contract<br>
for a commercial OTEC, nor can I overstate the importance<br>
of the FMF working with SSP to do the ground breaking<br>
research on mariculture and aquaculture using this OTEC's<br>
discharge waters.  There will be many orders for shore-based<br>
and then for larger floating OTECs once the commercial<br>
viability of this OTEC has been demonstrated to the venture<br>
capital community, and we can get into the OTEC game on the<br>
ground floor by helping SSP to design and build the mariculture<br>
and aquaponics facilities associated with their OTEC.<br>
<p>
An even more exciting prospect is a second contract that<br>
SSP is negotiating, where an uninhabited island with no<br>
infrastructure whatsoever will be getting a $500 Million<br>
dollar cruise ship pier, with attendant OTEC power and<br>
fresh water production to be provided by SSP.  We have<br>
here a perfect location for Aquarius Rising, where the<br>
land will be either free or very inexpensive, where there<br>
will be a continuous supply of cruise ship tourists, and<br>
where our entire business plan for AR can be implemented<br>
without the compications of an existing politicised<br>
population base that raises barriers to new projects.<br>
<p>
Bob wants the help of the FMF in coming up with the mariculture<br>
and aquaponics facilities plans, and SSP ALREADY HAS THE<br>
VENTURE CAPITAL TO BUILD THESE ON-SHORE AND NEAR-SHORE<br>
FACILITIES.  Basically, the OTEC component of the business<br>
plan for AR has become the SSP 10 MW shore-based OTEC with<br>
its 300,000 gallon per day fresh water production facility<br>
(via a first stage hybrid open cycle system).  The sub-sea<br>
habitat, water bottling facility, pavillion, hotels, sub<br>
tours, etc. can all be built as planned, and FMF MEMBERS<br>
can help build and run these facilities!<br>
<p>
This is going to be a pivital conclave, where we the FMF<br>
transition from TALKING to DOING, so get to Denver any way<br>
you can folks.<br>

They are hosting their annual conclave (conference) in Denver this year<br>
around the first of August.  For details please contact Phil above.<br>
