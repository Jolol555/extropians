Oh yes, I have read most of the books your referring too and several others *not* on THE LIST.  I have heard this debate about that many times<br>
too!  And it has yet to adequately address the challenge I set forth at the beginning of this thread.<br>
<p>
One OBVIOUS thing you seemed to have missed - is not ONCE have I ever mentioned or advocated government support to alleviate the potential<br>
problems I have outlined.  As a free-marketeer myself, I am asking others of the same ilk if they have insights into problems I have yet to<br>
find solutions for - i.e. the alleviation of the poor bastards permanantly automated of the economy during the *transition* to a nanotech one.<br>
<p>
So far only David Fabulich as been able to demonstrate anything of substance.  And oh, BTW, I have heard the same nanotech discussions<br>
circulate on the list as least 300 times in the last couple of years.<br>
