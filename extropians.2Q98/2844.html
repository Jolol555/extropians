<i>&gt; &gt;Welcome Michelle, if you are indeed new to the list. ( I don't recall seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your posts before a few days ago).</i><br>
<p>
thank you.  it spike, and ive been and exi member and posting for a couple<br>
months.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And excuse my cynicism, but, regarding the above, ...umm.. too late?</i><br>
<p>
it is difficult for me to explain where i am going with this thread.  my<br>
fault.the notion is that as governments get more technology that makes it easier<br>
<p>
for that government to oppress its people, these same people compensate<br>
by voting more libertarian, perhaps as a result of a healthy fear of misuse<br>
of the technology by the government.  circular reasoning?<br>
<p>
we have seen some post the notion that we should eschew the technology that<br>
takes away privacy.  i suggest we develop the technology and eschew the<br>
government control.  we can do it!  spike<br>
