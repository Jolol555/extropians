On the contrary:  rather, nobody uses metalanguages in day to day<br>
conversation.  (Lojban advocates, this is where you can pipe up if you<br>
feel like it. :) )  If we did, however, you're right, this is the sort <br>
of<br>
thing we'd say.<br>
<p>
Curiously, you could get away with this statement in ordinary language, <br>
but in a metalanguage suitably precise for defining Tarskian truths this <br>
sentence is nonsensical, because of problems drawing conclusions from <br>
exact time.  However, I'll make a couple other points before coming to <br>
this one.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    I like Bart Kosko's notion that Trotskian statements should be </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; assigned a fuzzy truth value.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;NO, and this is where me must take care.  First, I presume you mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;TARSKIAN statements.  ;)</i><br>
<p>
My mistake.  I sometimes get my communists and atomists confused.  They <br>
are both idealists doing battle against an ambigous world. <br>
<p>
  Second, we may say that our INFORMATION is<br>
<i>&gt;imprecise, but the TRUTH is not.  When properly defined, the sky is or </i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;not blue; we may be only 99% certain of its blueness on a clear day at</i><br>
<i>&gt;noon, but that is VERY different from saying that the sky is 99% blue</i><br>
<i>&gt;(again, restricted by our formal metalanguage).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We already quite often say in science that the wavelength of certain </i><br>
light<br>
<i>&gt;is 550 +/- 10 nm.  This is not to say that the wavelength varies, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;that our information is imprecise.  So, to the extent that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary, when we need to make clear how certain we are of something, </i><br>
we<br>
<i>&gt;will add the precision to which we think we know it. </i><br>
<p>
This argument does not hold up because an increase in informatio will <br>
actually increase the ambiguity, or at least make it more obvious.  It <br>
is certainly acceptable to assign blueness a range of 540-560 nm, but <br>
there will still be certain situations in which it is impossible to say <br>
whether the light is blue or not.  For the moment I am going to abandon <br>
the sky because the entire visible spectrum is present in what we <br>
perceive as the blue sky.  Imagine a satellite is beaming a laser down <br>
on our instrumentation.  We are trying to determine whether or not 'le <br>
laser est bleu' has a true or false Tarskian value, based on a <br>
definition fo blue between 540-560 nm.  Presume using advanced <br>
femtotechnology we have a wavelength detection instrument so precise <br>
that it can measure the distance between each individual photon that <br>
strikes the receptor down to the picometer scale or better.  This <br>
instrument will be able to detect wavelengths as precisely as physically <br>
possible.  Also presume that the laser on the satellite has been <br>
calibrated as precisely as physically possible.<br>
       If the laser on the satellite has been calibrated to 550 nm, or <br>
555, or 548, or any value in the middle of the blue range, we can quite <br>
easily give it a true value.  However, what if the laser is calibrated <br>
at exactly 540 nm at it's source?  As the laser shines through the <br>
atmosphere, the photons will be slightly, randomly refracted so that the <br>
time between photons striking the instrument will wobble slightly (The <br>
instrument would measure wavelength between individual photons by <br>
dividing the time between photon strikes by the speed of light).  Slight <br>
variations in temperature gradients throughout the atmosphere will slow <br>
photons sufficiently to cause a wavelength change (this problem is <br>
accerbated by the fact that both the position of the photons and the <br>
atoms of the instrument are slightly ambigous because of quantum <br>
uncertainty principles, but I shall ignore this factor for the moment).  <br>
The instrument would record the distances between individual photons as <br>
follows:<br>
Photon Number:     1     2     3     4     5     6     7      8 <br>
<p>
Distance Apart: (5) 39.97 40.03 40.01 40.04 39.99 39.95  40.04<br>
<p>
In fact the variation from 540nm would be far, far smaller (not taking <br>
into account quantum effects, because if one did you couldn't assign any <br>
precise number at all), but it makes no difference in principle.  <br>
Because the wavelength of the light will inevitable wobble, the validity <br>
of assigning a Tarskian truth value to the statement 'le laser est bleu' <br>
is destroyed by the fact that neither a true or a false value can be <br>
assigned at the borders of the definition (540 and 560 nm).  The change <br>
over time destroys any attempt at certainty.<br>
  One way to try to freeze the truth would be to freeze time, make the <br>
precisely 5:34 P.M statement mentioned earlier.  However, besides being <br>
impractical in the real world, if time was frozen, light would not <br>
travel and there would be no way for the instrumentation to measure any <br>
value at all.  If you froze time exactly at the point that a photon <br>
struck the receptor, you would be able to tell whether the light was <br>
blue in the past (540nm)/(186,000 km/sec)(I am suddenly struck by the <br>
mortal terror that I have misremembered the speed of light.  I will <br>
fight my neurosis by sending it off as is).  However, you would have <br>
absolutely no basis for saying whether the light is blue NOW because <br>
that will not become apparent until the next photon strikes the <br>
receptor, and of course nothing at all can be said about the matter <br>
until it is tested.  <br>
    As a brief backtrack, I'll note the advantage of ordinary language <br>
over metalanguage in that ordinary language allows just enough ambiguity <br>
to avoid nonsense.  When people use the term precisely, they allow for <br>
that to include enough time so that light and sound waves can continue a <br>
brief ways on their appointed rounds, thereby not striking the world <br>
deaf and blind at that precise moment.  I think the reason why common <br>
language is so much more common than metalanguage is that it is much <br>
more useful.<br>
     <br>
      In fact, it seems that allowing for a discrete range of blueness <br>
has made the ambiguity twice as bad.  If blue was defined as light with <br>
a wavelength of 550nm, at almost every point the Tarskian truth value of <br>
the statement 'le laser est bleu' would be false, except at 550nm which <br>
would be ambigous.  By creating a range, there is an area of clear <br>
truth, clear falsehood, and TWO ambigous points.  It does not seem to me <br>
that Tarskian logic is the path to finding absolute truth if there are <br>
necesarily ambiguities wherever one tries to draw boundries. Indeed, the <br>
only way to create a genuinely universal Tarskian logic statement would <br>
be by defining blue as being the set of all wavelengths, i.e., an <br>
infinite statement.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;We don't need "fuzzy truth" statements: the truth is binary,</i><br>
<p>
I admire faith, and thus I choose not to argue against it.  As bivalent <br>
truth is the foundation of an information system, it cannot be supported <br>
using the precepts of that system, any more than you can say that the <br>
Pope is infallible because the infallible Pope said so. A foundation <br>
cannot have foundations.  I chose to allow for fuzzy truth because I <br>
find it more relaxing philosophically and allows me to see more creative <br>
possibilities.  My support of fuzzy truth does not have any more logical <br>
basis than your support of binary truth.<br>
<p>
 and we<br>
<i>&gt;already have a means of communicating precision.</i><br>
<p>
And the greater the precision, the more clear it becomes that it isn't <br>
very clear.<br>
