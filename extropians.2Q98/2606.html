trappings?"<br>

I've often thought this to be the case.  For a<br>
place to start research why not look at modern<br>
traditions?  There are literally thousands of<br>
traditions that have come about in much the same<br>
way as you describe here, but it would be far<br>
easier to track them through history.  Tradition<br>
could be seen as something that once had purpose,<br>
but is now kept for its entertainment- or<br>
reassurance value. (Also look at modern rituals -<br>
like luck charms - that "lucky" tie that got you<br>
your job, etc.)  There seems to be a huge number<br>
of situations that support this theory.<br>
