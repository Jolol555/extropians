One problem with simplistic space expansion models is that space may be<br>
infinite.  In the simplest models from general relativity, if the density<br>
of the universe is so small that it will expand forever and not contract,<br>
that also implies that the universe, although curved, does not "close"<br>
and so goes on forever.<br>
<p>
You can still have an expanding universe even if it is spatially infinite.<br>
It just means that distant objects move apart, slowly at first, and then<br>
faster and faster.<br>
<p>
Suppose space were not expanding.  It is three dimensional, obviously<br>
(ignoring the "time dimension").  Would you demand that there exist a<br>
four dimensional space in which the three dimensional one was embedded,<br>
in order to give it reality?  And would that four dimensional space have<br>
to be part of a larger five dimensional space, which is itself part of<br>
a six dimensional one, and so on?<br>
<p>
All this is conceivable, but is it really necessary?  I don't think we need<br>
to assume there are higher dimensional spaces in order to give ours<br>
reality.<br>
<p>
Even though our space is said to be "curved", and expanding, those<br>
properties do not require higher dimensional spaces, either.  Curvature is<br>
like a gradual internal warping of space, so that large enough triangles<br>
don't have angles that add to exactly 180 degrees.  It can be fully<br>
described without reference to any larger embedding space.<br>
<p>
Likewise the expansion of space can be expressed soley in terms of the<br>
relations between objects within our universe.  There is no need to<br>
postulate a higher dimensional universe which ours is part of.<br>
