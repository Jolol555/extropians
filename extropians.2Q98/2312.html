<i>&gt;A bit of an exaggeration, Betamax gave a better picture but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference was subtle, so subtle you couldn't even tell the</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference unless you had a very good and expensive TV, and there</i><br>
<i>&gt;are more important technical considerations. When VHS first cane</i><br>
<i>&gt;out it could record 2 hours on one cassette, Betamax could only</i><br>
<i>&gt;handle one, by the time Betamax cane out with 2 hours VHS was up</i><br>
<i>&gt;to 4 and very soon after that 6 hour. Remember this was a time</i><br>
<i>&gt;when blank cassettes or either type were very expensive, about $20</i><br>
<i>&gt;each, and that was in 1980 dollars.</i><br>
<p>
If I've told myself once, I've told myself a million times, don't<br>
exaggerate!   ;)<br>

You may have me here on total history, My Betamax was/is (still<br>
going) a Sony SuperBeta Theatre. It runs Beta I,II,III, and I<br>
always ran it on Beta III, (3 hours recording) and always<br>
demonstrated it side by side with a VHS that way. (dual trinitron<br>
monitors) Under such conditions the difference was very striking,<br>
not until Super-VHS was it even close.<br>
 <br>
So I guess I concede that Beta I and VHS were close.... :)<br>

Point John.....<br>
