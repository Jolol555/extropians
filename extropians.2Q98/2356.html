Only from the photon's reference frame; not from my own.<br>

<p>
Yes, but the idea of "old photons" is not speaking to the point of<br>
universal time, but only with respect to t=0 *in my reference frame*.<br>
<i>&gt;From the perspective of everything with respect to everything else, yes,</i><br>
it took no "net time," but it took time with respect to my reference<br>
frame, and that's all I was trying to assert.<br>
<p>
As for why my definition is better than your three laws?  I posit that<br>
THESE are the three laws of atomism:<br>
<p>
1) A is A.<br>
2) A is not both A and not-A with respect to 0.<br>
3) A is either A or not-A with respect to 0.<br>
<p>
Here I use "with respect to 0" to mean that the partial difference between<br>
A and 0 is either A or not-A and not both.  Ask anybody who claims to be<br>
an atomist and they will agree with the laws as posited.<br>
<p>
Why is my definition better?  My definition is better because it is the<br>
one most people use.  "Atomism" means whatever people use it to mean, and<br>
they happen to use it to mean that A is either A or not-A and not both<br>
with respect to 0. The omission of "with respect to 0" from your statement<br>
of the laws is trivial: it is implicit in everything that we do or say<br>
that we are always referring to the partial difference, and never the<br>
"whole" difference, when we talk about difference.  (By we, I mean not<br>
YOU, Ian, obviously.)  No one defines "difference" the way you define<br>
difference, Ian, and that's all there is to it.  Atomism is right because<br>
it uses different definitions than you do.<br>
<p>
If I have allowed a bit of frustration to creep into this post, it is<br>
purely because this argument SHOULD have ended years ago.  Neither<br>
atomists nor holists disagree with the laws I posit above.  No<br>
disagreement means that there's nothing to debate.  Learn to love the<br>
atomists: you've got us sorely misunderstood.<br>
