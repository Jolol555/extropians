<p>
I suspect that this meme won't be as hard to overcome as you seem to<br>
believe, and as stated in the original media story, it may actually just be<br>
the reporter's reasonable hedge against disappointment. After all, we here<br>
in the US now enjoy an average lifespan nearly half again as long as our<br>
great grand-parents did a century ago and yet we don't have any kind of<br>
"Logan's Run"-like disbelief that only the rare individual might live<br>
happily and healthily into his eighth decade or older, as was surely the<br>
case in 1898. Quite the opposite, especially now, with large numbers of<br>
people from the Baby-boom cadre approaching "senior citizen" status, I<br>
think we are seeing a continuing shift of the media's image of older<br>
Americans as active, healthy, alive individuals, as opposed to wizened old<br>
prunes waiting to die. The two images, representing our fears and our<br>
hopes, do constant battle. But the age of 'old-age' seems to keep racheting<br>
up.<br>
<p>
I suspect that the Average Joe and Jane's expectations about "reasonable"<br>
life span will closely track the lifespan available to them. The challenge<br>
to Extropians is to be ahead of that swell of general knowledge - we're<br>
trying to surf that future-wave, not content to be dragged along as flotsam<br>
by the inevitable current of progress or deposited on the bottom as<br>
detritus by the turbulence of change.<br>

Hang twelve baby!<br>
