That long URL points to a short article in ComputerWorld Australia which<br>
describes the poisoned water supply story as a myth.  There is not much<br>
detail in the article itself, though.<br>
<p>
A poster on c.s.y-2000 claimed that the Sun-Herald, which printed the<br>
original claim, was a lightweight, semi-tabloid newspaper better known<br>
for its entertainment value than its news coverage.<br>
<p>
Even though this story is apparently not true, potential failures in<br>
embedded computer systems are a serious problem which the industry is<br>
only beginning to grapple with.  The possible consequences of failures<br>
of the infrastructure are at least as bad as failures of the financial<br>
system or the government.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, liability concerns are forcing many companies into making<br>
only ambiguous Y2K statements, with no guarantees of success.  The concern<br>
is that even if they think they are compliant, giving guarantees will<br>
open them up to liability in the event that something goes wrong, even<br>
something out of their control (like phones or electricity failing).<br>
This makes it difficult for outsiders to determine what is the true<br>
state of affairs.<br>
