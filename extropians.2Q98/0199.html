<i>&gt; Ahhh...Michael ....I don't like flame wars, so I will try a last time to</i><br>

<i>&gt; by "socialist transhumanists" you mean everybody who don't share your</i><br>
<i>&gt; extreme positions.</i><br>
<p>
What starts flame wars is to immediately label your opponent an extremist,<br>
trying to make yourself look reasonable. Take your own advice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, please first, stop to imagine there are two</i><br>
<i>&gt; camps, red-commies-stalinian- socialists on one side,</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarians-individualist-capitalists on the other; you will really</i><br>
<i>&gt; progress in your  analysis. May I remind you that most of the stalinian</i><br>
<i>&gt; crimes were due to the belief there was only two camps: the "nice guys"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the others, who had to be fighted and eventually killed. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; really don't like communism, you should stop to adopt their main</i><br>
<i>&gt; characteristics, don't you think ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; So now, let's go to Michael's (Bowling) definition : we should be pissed</i><br>
<i>&gt; of , really ? By saying that, you prove one more time that you didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand most of the arguments of your opponents. Or worse, you didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; hear. That's sad. So open your ears and listen :</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nobody here is opposed to individual freedom. The socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanists (by this term, you certainly want to name the mad guys</i><br>
<i>&gt; who think that the free market defects have to be corrected by a welfare</i><br>
<i>&gt; system) are advocates of individual freedom. that's why we want to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure that ANYBODY (sorry for shouting, but the message seems hard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; pass) can decide of his evolution, according to his own desires, and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be forbidden to succeed because he is born on the wrong side of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bronx.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this clear enough, or must I capitalize other words?</i><br>
<p>
The socialists transhumanists make a mistake when they try to label<br>
libertarians as selfish meanies who want to keep the have-nots in the<br>
ghetto. They are also polarizing the argument by doing so. Take your own<br>
advice.<br>
<p>
Libertarians beleive that every person should have equality of opportunity.<br>
They steadfastly oppose that people should be guarranteed equality of<br>
results. Socialists do, and that is the main point of contention which you<br>
refuse to acknowledge. Take your own advice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You can disagree with my opinion; I just want you to understand it and</i><br>
<i>&gt; be fair in your opposition, instead of using low-level (and constant,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and frequently out of topic, as here)  propaganda. The worst thing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; this, (from your own point of view) being that you give a very bad image</i><br>
<i>&gt; of your own camp, therefore forbidding any intelligent discussion on</i><br>
<i>&gt; economical matters on this list. Fortunately, there are more open-minded</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarians.</i><br>
<p>
I am known to be very open minded, however, any individual person only has<br>
to learn about socialism once to decide that is it utter foolishness or not,<br>
which tends to say somethig about their intelligence. I have yet to meet a<br>
committed socialist that has an open mind.<br>
<p>
Mr Bowling's excellent statement never once mentioned anything about the<br>
state. Only about the individual. Socialists know that their fondest dreams<br>
require guns to people's heads by government goons to make reality. Those<br>
that don't are either liars or fools.<br>
