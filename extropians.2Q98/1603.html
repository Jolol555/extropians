'Buzzed' gives straight answers on drugs <br>

DURHAM, N.C. (May 12, 1998 01:26 a.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) - Don't let<br>
those Hershey's cravings carry you away -- chocolate stimulates the same<br>
receptors in the brain as marijuana.<br>
<p>
Don't follow John Travolta and plunge an adrenaline needle into someone's<br>
heart to reverse an opiate overdose -- that "Pulp Fiction" scene was simply<br>
incorrect.<br>
<p>
Don't get high the day before a calculus exam -- marijuana impairs<br>
short-term memory for two days.<br>
<p>
These are just a few of the tidbits in "Buzzed," a sort of Betty Crocker<br>
book for the recreational drug world. In it, three Duke University<br>
scientists -- whose motto is "Just Say Know" -- dispel the misconceptions<br>
and myths about used and abused drugs from alcohol to Ecstasy.<br>
<p>
The idea came from co-author Bill Wilson's daughter, a college junior who<br>
had frank questions about drugs and their effects.<br>
<p>
Since it was published in March, the book with the psychedelic red-and-blue<br>
spiral on the cover slowly has caught on with law enforcement agencies,<br>
drug addiction counselors and educators. The Chapel Hill-Carrboro (N.C.)<br>
School District, for instance, plans to stock "Buzzed" in every school<br>
library.<br>
<p>
"It has information that students need and want without being<br>
condescending," said Susan Spalt, health coordinator for the Chapel<br>
Hill-Carrboro schools. "It doesn't beat around the bush, it doesn't use<br>
scare tactics, but on the other hand it gives a very real overview of the<br>
problems and consequences."<br>
<p>
"Buzzed" tells far more than any high school health textbook: For every<br>
drug, it describes the high feeling, ill effects, history and slang terms.<br>
<p>
"We're scientists," co-author Cynthia Kuhn said. "We don't formulate public<br>
policy; we're not lawyers. We understand what the drugs do."<br>
<p>
All three authors conduct brain research on rats. Kuhn studies the effects<br>
of drugs on the brain and teaches an undergraduate course, "Drugs and the<br>
Brain." Clinical neuropsychologist Scott Swartzwelder teaches "Memory and<br>
the Brain," and treats patients with brain disorders. Wilson, a<br>
neuropharmacologist, studies the way drugs affect learning and memory.<br>
<p>
Readable, unbiased and scientific, "Buzzed" is the answer, the authors say,<br>
to the government's scare tactics in the war on drugs, misinformation on<br>
the Internet and the public schools' anti-drug program, "Just Say No."<br>
<p>
Not all drugs have the same danger level, the authors contend, and<br>
anti-drug programs lose credibility every time a kid smokes a joint and<br>
lives to tell about it.<br>
<p>
"Often, the government will use the term 'dangerous' about every drug,"<br>
Wilson said. "We say the 'Just Say No' phrase is dangerous; it's destructive."<br>
<p>
People will make smarter decisions about drugs, the authors said, if they<br>
have good information.<br>
<p>
"There is this fear that if you start educating people, then you're somehow<br>
giving people permission to use," Swartzwelder said.<br>
<p>
The authors distilled data from hundreds of research papers and sprinkled<br>
the book with literary and cultural references -- from excerpts of William<br>
Burroughs' novel "Junkie" to the poppy field scene in "The Wizard of Oz."<br>
<p>
"There's very little drug education in high schools, there's zero in<br>
college and there's zero in real life," Kuhn said.<br>
<p>
All three authors were surprised, they said, to find out how often college<br>
students use and abuse drugs without knowing the dangers.<br>
<p>
Wilson gained a rare glimpse into the college drug scene when his daughter,<br>
Heather, entered Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., three years ago.<br>
<p>
"We have a great relationship, and we're always talking about drugs,"<br>
Wilson said. "And she was a little too interested in drugs."<br>
<p>
Wilson was visiting campus one weekend when he and Heather discovered a<br>
friend of hers lying unconscious on the dormitory floor in a pool of blood.<br>
The girl had mixed cold medicine with bourbon, became delusional and tried<br>
to slit her wrists, Wilson said. The girl would not have been suicidal,<br>
both Wilsons said, if she had known not to mix the drugs.<br>
<p>
Another time, Heather and some friends decided not to try the drug<br>
"Ecstasy" after consulting Wilson and one of Kuhn's textbooks and learning<br>
that the drug can cause permanent mood disorders.<br>
<p>
"This was such a clear illustration that when people have good information,<br>
straight information, they tend to make good decisions for themselves,"<br>
said Heather Wilson, who helped research the book.<br>
<p>
The book is unusual because scientists don't usually take the time to put<br>
their findings into such readable language, said Carlton Erickson, head of<br>
the Addiction Science Research and Education Center at University of Texas<br>
at Austin's College of Pharmacy.<br>
<p>
"It takes books like this to be able to synthesize all this information,"<br>
said Erickson, who co-wrote a similar book, "Drugs, the Brain and<br>
Behavior," that should be published next month. "There's a lot of people<br>
taking these drugs, and we have to know how to help those people."<br>
