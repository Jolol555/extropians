In a message dated 98-06-22 19:18:50 EDT, Alexander Chislenko rearranged the<br>
electrons to say:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I wonder what they think of the economic environment for<br>
 the period covered in their forecast.  The economic utility<br>
 of both humans and machines should very considerably<br>
 change; any  long-term economic scenario should take<br>
 into account radically different organizational methods,<br>
 cheap little robots with image recognition taking over<br>
 much of current work, etc.  If anybody was able to give<br>
 quantitative assessments of such things, I would drop<br>
 everything else I'm doing and go learn from them.<br>
 Maybe, I should start from requesting that report... &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I haven't yet read the report, but it would surprise me rather a lot if they<br>
considered any such thing.   The more likely scenario, imho, would have them<br>
painting a sunny picture based on what they know about out level of technology<br>
right now.  Should that be the case, then any paradigm shifting discoveries<br>
such as "cheap little robots with image recognition" would likely make an<br>
otherwise very optimistic prediction look very shabby indeed.  Anything other<br>
than trend prediction based on a solid historical record, a la Julian Simon,<br>
would fall into the same category of mistake that the "1 extinction every 20<br>
minutes" environmentalists make.  It would just happen to fall on the opposite<br>
side of the spectrum.<br>
<p>
But I could always be wrong,<br>
