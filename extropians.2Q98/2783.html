As we develop more and more powerful technologies which are more and more<br>
efficient in their potential to be used to interfere or restrain the<br>
individual's rights, the threat of government overreaching becomes even more<br>
amplified, and by neccessity, will force the body of individuals to elect to<br>

TANSTAAFL: Acronym coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his novel _The Moone is a<br>
Harsh Mistress_ and it means "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch", which<br>
is also known as the Laws of Thermodynamics, and the central tenet of<br>
Libertarian thought. Heinlein's novel is about a revolution of the Luanr Penal<br>
Colonies against its Earth Opressors, masterminded by a computer technician, a<br>
beautiful young political rabble rouser, a retired rational anarchist, and a<br>
spontaneously born artificial intelligence in the Lunar computer network called<br>
Mike, who thinks its all one big joke...<br>
<p>
Fnord (f-nord) n. 1. Mythical Creature representing hidden truth and mind<br>
expanding realizations. First coined by Robert Anton Wilson in his _Illuminatus!<br>
Trilogy_. Exercise for the Reader: Over your bowl of cereal, turn to the<br>
editorial pages of your newspaper. Read Between the Lines. When said fnords come<br>
into focus, shout, "The fnords! The fnords! I see the fnords!"<br>
<p>
My statement about fnords is a paraphrase of  "believing 6 impossible things<br>
before breakfast". The correct answer to my question, of course, is 23...<br>
