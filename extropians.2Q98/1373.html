For example, there is a classification of atheists that is:<br>
<p>
Positive Atheists x Negative Atheists.<br>
<p>
The former are all those who do not believe in god by logical positive<br>
reasons and are sure of that, f.ex. because of scientically based reasons.<br>
In second class are all the rest, who deny god's existence simply by<br>
negative reasons. There are included those who don't believe in god because<br>
they think there is so much bad in the world, or their mothers, in general<br>
religious, hit them a lot when they were children or because they lost the<br>
love of their lives and so do not believe anymore... These are not even<br>
considered serious atheists and at the first laugh of a girl/boy in a<br>
religious cult ( or even someone pass the hands on their asses... :)  ),<br>
turn to be great believers...: "God made marvelous things to me... Alelujah<br>
!!! " ... they have just psychological ( even if little ) problems or social<br>
non-adjustments... got it ???<br>

Positive Atheist<br>
