"Retardation of Experimental Tumorigenesis and Reduction in DNA Adducts by<br>
Tumeric and Curcumin"<br>
<p>
Abstract:<br>
<p>
   Tumeric and its active principle curcumin have been extensively<br>
investigated for their antimutagenic and antioxidant effects in bacteria<br>
and animal systems. Because oral cancers are common in India, an<br>
experimental model of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene-induced buccal pouch<br>
tumors in Syrians Golden hamsters was used to evaluate the tumor<br>
retardation effects of turmeric and curcumin. Turmeric and/or curcumin was<br>
administered in the diet and/or applied locally for 14 weeks along with<br>
7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene. After the experimental period, the animals<br>
were sacrificed and oral pouches were examined for tumor number and size.<br>
DNA adducts were estimated by 32P postlabel assay in the cheek pouches.<br>
Neoplastic changes were graded by histopathology. The results of the study<br>
suggest that turmeric or curcumin in the diet and/or applied locally<br>
significantly reduced DNA adducts at the target site. Tumor number and<br>
tumor burden were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in the animals that recieved<br>
tumeric in the diet and applied locally. The histopathological examinations<br>
suggested that the neoplastic grading was least in the animals fed or<br>
painted with curcumin (p&lt;0.05). The current study demonstrates that<br>
turmeric or curcumin administered in the diet or applied as paint may have<br>
a plausible chemopreventive effect on oral precancerous lesions.<br>
<p>
Additional note:<br>
<p>
   The dietary dosage used was 1% for turmeric, and 0.03% for curcumin,<br>
which is the yellow pigment in tumeric.  A human consuming about 2500<br>
calories daily of the rodent chow would ingest roughly 6 grams of turmeric<br>
or 200 mg of curcumin.<br>
