Well put. Transhumanism claims that we can modify the human condition<br>
in various ways; more specifically, it claims this can be done through<br>
rational means such as technology. There is a division here between<br>
those who acknowledge this, but regard such changes as bad (an<br>
increasing number of people have advanced to this stage from the<br>
original "nothing new under the sun" stage) and those who think there<br>
can be very positive consequences of such changes. I prefer to only<br>
call the last group real transhumanists, since otherwise Jeremy Rifkin<br>
would likely be a transhumanist too.<br>
<p>
Note that humanism in its most open-minded form doesn't necessarily<br>
have a problem with this, but in practice many humanists regard the<br>
assumption of an unchanging human condition as essential for their<br>
philosophy.<br>
