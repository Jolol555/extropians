Ah, my cue!  <br>
<p>
If anyone is interested in checking out the range of reviewers' responses<br>
to the idea of the Spike nee Singularity (in Australia at any rate which is<br>
the only place yet that my book has been published, damn and blast it)<br>
Compare &amp; Contrast the links in the box called `OzLit Pages Relating to<br>
this Writer' at<br>
<p>
<a href="http://dargo.vicnet.net.au/ozlit/writers.cfm?id=74.0">http://dargo.vicnet.net.au/ozlit/writers.cfm?id=74.0</a><br>
<p>
Especially worth comparing are the ones by Barry Jones (a stinkeroo from a<br>
world-class polymath who set up the notable Australian govt Commission for<br>
the Future, now disbanded for lack of interest), Alan Olding (pleasant but<br>
in places missing the point) and Race Mathews (amazingly astute, er, that<br>
is, generous).  There are also links to some samples or extracts from a<br>
couple of my masterpieces...<br>
<p>
Well, *I* reckon it's S and not N; YMMV.  (Not to mention YVH.)<br>
