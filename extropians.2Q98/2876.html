Harvey:<br>
<i>&gt;To establish the relationship between age and violence, one would need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to eliminate other age-related factors. </i><br>
<p>
Absolutely agree ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I believe that wealth increases with age.  I believe that a lack of money</i><br>
<i> &gt;is the leading cause of violence. Persons with money resort to</i><br>
<i> &gt;violence less often to obtain what they need or desire.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Before promoting advanced age as a PR point, consider the negative PR</i><br>
<i> &gt;that advanced age may bring to mind.</i><br>
<p>
I also agree that it is probable that persons with money resort to violence<br>
less often, as there is no material need.  But you have to be careful about<br>
what one defines as a 'leading cause'. For example, the large male<br>
population could be seen as the leading cause of violence.<br>
<p>
As a bit of anecdotal evidence for the connection between age and<br>
violent crime, I am acquainted with a number of men who committed<br>
violent crimes in their youth.  Ten years later, despite being monetarily no<br>
better off today, they admit to having 'slowed down' and wouldn't<br>
consider performing the acts today.<br>
