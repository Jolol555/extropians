<i>&gt; As for 2, I find it rather revealing that at my research group (around</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10 people) there are one guitarrist in a rock band, one synth player,</i><br>
<i>&gt; one organist and one professional pianist - at least among</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational neuroscientists there are artistic people - but they all</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to be creating music in its traditional form (rock, church music,</i><br>
<i>&gt; modern classical music), not trying to combine their science with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; art. There seems to be a kind of taboo here, that one shouldn't put</i><br>
<i>&gt; science into art or art into science. I would like to see art that</i><br>
<i>&gt; express science and science that express art. This is why I look</i><br>
<i>&gt; forward to the Cajal space mission - Cajal showed that science can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; art.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I really hope I can turn some of my research into art one day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I would go further and say that most really good science is a result of<br>
very creative, artistic thinking, combined with a very vigorous logic.<br>
The two go together synergistically.<br>
