Grrr.  Last time I write an essay for YOU, smarty pants.  :p<br>
<p>

how the<br>

<p>
Well, first of all, as I think I may have already showed, it's very likely<br>
that people will WANT to work.  There's always another planet to colonize,<br>
after all.  ;)  So this question may be ill-founded.<br>
<p>
However, your point.  Even if a couple of essential goods DO become so<br>
cheap as to be free, (food for example,) there are a number of ways<br>
capitalism can deal with it.  Consider how we've dealt with matches,<br>
drinking water, etc.  I imagine food machines as ubiquitous as bathrooms<br>
(which were a luxury within my grandmother's lifetime).  Expect to see free<br>
lunches being offered wherever there is something worth selling.  Hell, if<br>
there's even one charitable organization interested in distributing food,<br>
and it becomes cheap enough to do so freely, we can expect that<br>
organization to distribute food like there was no tomorrow.  Similarly, I'm<br>
imagining free hospitals set up to advertise other goods... stuff like<br>
that.  We've dealt with water in abundance, we can deal with honey just as<br>
easily.<br>
<p>
Satisfied?<br>
