<p>
The prime difference between a PPA and a nation state is that a) a PPA isnt in a<br>
monopoly position enforced by overwhelming force of arms, as a nation state is, b)<br>
a PPA's client should have an ability to choose among various services, and only<br>
have to pay for the ones desired, and c) if your PPA provides poor service, or<br>
abuses its customers, its competitors should be able to acquire that PPA's<br>
customers as they so choose.<br>
<p>
So its basically a difference of being a free market of politics and being a<br>
monopoly dictator.<br>
