Yes I know you do Dan and your arguments have been compelling, but your eqaution<br>
still included the *necessity* of work.  With increasing automation why should we<br>
be forced to choose between work and destitution?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Uhm...  How about people work, buy their upgrades, and live posthumanly</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever after?</i><br>
<p>
Great idea!   Assuming that people will have enough money to do that. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Grrr.  Last time I write an essay for YOU, smarty pants.  :p</i><br>
<p>
I should have been more precise in excluding you.  You have come closest to<br>
addressing my concerns.  I am quite grateful for your input depite my smarty-pants<br>
shoulder-chip.  :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, first of all, as I think I may have already showed, it's very likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; that people will WANT to work.  There's always another planet to colonize,</i><br>
<i>&gt; after all.  ;)  So this question may be ill-founded.</i><br>
<p>
Work as forced labor which it is now is definitly something I DON'T WANT TO DO.<br>
Working on colonizing space - that wouldnt be forced.  You'd have to pay me alot<br>
of money to keep me from doing that kind of work!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Hell, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's even one charitable organization interested in distributing food,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and it becomes cheap enough to do so freely, we can expect that</i><br>
<i>&gt; organization to distribute food like there was no tomorrow.  Similarly, I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagining free hospitals set up to advertise other goods... stuff like</i><br>
<i>&gt; that.  We've dealt with water in abundance, we can deal with honey just as</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Satisfied?</i><br>
<p>
Getting there!  :-)<br>
