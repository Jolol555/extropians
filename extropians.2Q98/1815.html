(Apologies to Susan Masterman for 'borrowing' her title).<br>
<p>
<p>
I'm mildly surprised that more readers of this list are not fully familiar <br>
with logician Alfred Tarski's reconstruction of a commonsense <br>
Correspondence Theory of Objective Truth, utilizing a metalanguage, <br>
whereby we evaluate the truth content of formal statements concerning <br>
objective reality.<br>
<p>
   This following example is a bit more complex than first appears -- it's <br>
   deceptively simple -- sometimes there is more to the obvious than is <br>
   obvious...  &gt;:-} ).<br>
<p>
<p>
   Following Tarski, we may say:<br>
   <br>
   'The statement "le ciel est bleu" is true if --<br>
   <br>
   and only if --<br>
   <br>
   the sky is, in fact, blue.'<br>
   <br>
   Thus, we can examine and test the correspondence of statements with <br>
   objective reality, with the metalanguage serving to avoid tautology, <br>
   among other things.<br>
   <br>
   Readers of Popper will be fully cognizant of Tarski's wonderful <br>
   breakthrough, which provides unbreakable logical foundations for the <br>
   commonsense idea that there exists a truth directly related to reality, <br>
   without all the subjectivist errors and pitfalls.<br>
<p>
<p>
   Bayesian Probability is worth a look too -- it's extensively favored by <br>
   the intelligence community, which is why my friend Admiral Gayler says <br>
   "Intelligence work is a probabilistic kind of thing."  But Tarski's <br>
   method is superior in that it is exact, not probabilistic.<br>

   PS:  Someone on this list, whose address I alas mislaid, asked me if <br>
   I'd ever met William Warren Bartley, and what I thought of him.<br>
   <br>
   Yes, I met Bill Bartley in London in the early Eighties, in the company <br>
   of my great friend Jeremy Shearmer (for eight years Popper's Research <br>
   Assistant) who knew him well.  I thought he was a bit 'stand-offish' <br>
   (he _did_ say "I don't care what anyone thinks.').  This seemed a bit <br>
   odd for a philosopher and an acolyte of Werner Erhard's 'est'!  The <br>
   world (and I mean 'the entire world') is however permanently indebted <br>
   to him for his rescuing some of Popper's unpublished writings.<br>
<p>
   Bartley wrote a lovely book on Lewis Carroll's Logic.  It's such a <br>
   shame to lose people like Bartley and Feynman so young.<br>
<p>
   I think his (prize-winning) book on Erhard and 'est' is very brave (he <br>
   expected it to ruin his academic reputation, instead of which it won <br>
   eleven prizea!  &gt;:-} ) but is badly flawed by its failing to identify <br>
   the origins of the various elements of the 'est' training, foremost <br>
   among which are Mind Dynamics and Silva Mind Control.<br>
   <br>
   Feynman (Richard) knew Werner Erhard too, BTW.  I've been to meetings <br>
   with Erhard, but never met him personally.  He's very funny, and a <br>
   brilliant raconteur.  I haven't done his 'Forum' training, so I can't <br>
   say whether it has the flaws (or the brilliance) of 'est.' I'm wary of <br>
   things with Roman titles -- I'm with Greece against Rome (and Athens <br>
   against Sparta).<br>
<p>
   I'll always remember thinking, early on in the 'est' training: "This is <br>
   the most brilliantly clever, intricate and powerful thing I've _ever_ <br>
   seen in all my life."  (I'd already toured NIMROD at Harwell, the <br>
   Atomic Energy Research Establishment) when it was under construction. <br>
   The big accelerators are truly _awesome_).  With all its faults, that's <br>
   still true. I work on a CD-ROM based Human Potential Skills Evocation <br>
   Programme which will (I hope!) be _more_ brilliant, _more_ intelligent; <br>
   and _staggeringly_ powerful.<br>

   PPS: Nanci; do you know the 'Light Doodler' gadget?  Comes from <br>
   Chatsworth, California -- It's really beautiful.  A spinning 4" <br>
   polycarbonate ring has wired multi-coloured micro-LEDs set into the <br>
   circumference which switch on and off under microprocessor control to <br>
   create polychromatic light patterns on the described surface of a <br>
   sphere.  It has pattern controls, and a microphone to enable it to <br>
   'play along' with music, voices etc.<br>
   <br>
   Very Extropian!  Around $50 retail.<br>
