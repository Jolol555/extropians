HOPE IN THE LAB: A special report.<br>
<p>
A Cautious Awe Greets Drugs That Eradicate Tumors in Mice <br>
<p>
By GINA KOLATA <br>
<p>
   Within a year, if all goes well, the first cancer patient will be<br>
injected with two new drugs that can eradicate any type of cancer, with<br>
no obvious side effects and no drug resistance -- in mice. <br>
<p>
   Some cancer researchers say the drugs are the most exciting treatment<br>
that they have ever seen. But then they temper their enthusiasm with<br>
caution, noting that the history of cancer treatments is full of high<br>
expectations followed by dashed hopes when drugs with remarkable effects<br>
in animals are tested in people. <br>
<p>
    Still, the National Cancer Institute has made the drugs its top<br>
priority, said Dr. Richard D. Klausner, the director. Dr. Klausner<br>
called them "the single most exciting thing on the horizon" for the<br>
treatment of cancer. <br>
<p>
   "I am putting nothing on higher priority than getting this into<br>
clinical trials," Dr. Klausner said. The mouse studies are "remarkable<br>
and wonderful," he said, and "very compelling." But he pointed out that<br>
the studies were in mice and so, when it comes to humans, he said he<br>
wanted to emphasize "the if's." <br>
<p>
   The new drugs, angiostatin and endostatin, work by interfering with<br>
the blood supply tumors need. Given together, they make tumors disappear<br>
and not return. <br>
<p>
   Dr. James M. Pluda, who is directing the cancer institute's planned<br>
tests of the drugs in patients, said he and others at the institute were<br>
"electrified" when they heard the drug's discoverer deliver a lecture<br>
about the newest results. "People were almost overwhelmed," Dr. Pluda<br>
said. "The data were remarkable." <br>
<p>
   Although the discovery of the drugs, and some of their effects, have<br>
been reported over the past few years, Dr. Pluda said that "if people<br>
understood how many steps ahead" the research was compared to what had<br>
been published, "they'd be even more in awe." <br>
<p>
   But Dr. Jerome Groopman, a cancer researcher at the Harvard Medical<br>
School, was wary. "We are all driven by hope," Dr. Groopman said. "But a<br>
sober scientist waits for the data." And until the drugs are given to<br>
humans, he said, the crucial data simply do not exist. <br>
<p>
<p>
   So far, the drugs are the only ones ever tested that can seemingly<br>
eradicate all tumors in mice, even gigantic ones, equivalent to a<br>
two-pound growth in a person. The best that other cancer drugs have done<br>
is slow the growth of these large tumors.  Mice are the traditional test<br>
animals in cancer research. <br>
<p>
   But even the drugs' discoverer, Dr. Judah Folkman, a cancer<br>
researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston, is cautious about the<br>
drugs' promise. Until patients take them, he said, it is dangerous to<br>
make predictions. All he knows, Dr. Folkman said, is that "if you have<br>
cancer and you are a mouse, we can take good care of you." <br>
<p>
   Other scientists are not so restrained. "Judah is going to cure<br>
cancer in two years," said Dr. James D. Watson, a Nobel laureate who<br>
directs the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a cancer research center on<br>
Long Island. Dr. Watson said Dr. Folkman would be remembered along with<br>
scientists like Charles Darwin as someone who permanently altered<br>
civilization. <br>
<p>
   The long trail to the discovery of the new drugs began more than 30<br>
years ago when Dr. Folkman became obsessed by what many saw as a<br>
quixotic notion: that cancers cannot grow beyond the size of a pinhead<br>
unless they have their own blood supply. If he could block a tumor's<br>
blood supply, he reasoned, the tumor should shrink to a minuscule size. <br>
<p>
   The first major break in the efforts came a decade ago when Dr.<br>
Folkman and his collaborators found drugs that did what he envisioned.<br>
He called them anti-angiogenesis drugs because they stopped the process<br>
of developing new blood vessels, or angiogenesis. They slow tumor growth<br>
in animals but do not eradicate the tumors. Early results in patients<br>
indicate that the drugs may slow human cancers. Dozens of companies are<br>
developing such drugs. <br>
<p>
   The results with these weaker drugs were "a proof of principle," said<br>
Dr. Bart Chernow, a professor of medicine and dean for research and<br>
technology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr.<br>
Chernow is a founder of Entremed, a company in Rockville, Md., that was<br>
formed to make and market angiostatin, endostatin and other weaker drugs<br>
that can slow cancer growth. <br>
<p>
   But the real breakthrough -- and the two new drugs -- came from Dr.<br>
Folkman's efforts to understand a peculiar phenomenon that has been<br>
known to cancer surgeons for 100 years: sometimes a patient will have a<br>
single tumor, with no evidence whatsoever of metastases, the satellite<br>
cancers that can pepper a patient's body. A doctor will remove the tumor<br>
and all will seem fine. But then, a few months later, a whole series of<br>
metastases will appear, grow, and kill the patient. <br>
<p>
   In 1989, Dr. Folkman proposed a reason for the effect, which he wrote<br>
on a large white board in a room where his laboratory group had its<br>
weekly seminars. Is it possible, he asked, that a tumor could be making<br>
both stimulators and inhibitors of blood vessel growth? If so, the<br>
inhibitors might travel through the bloodstream, squelching metastases.<br>
When the large tumor was removed, it would no longer be a source of<br>
inhibitors, allowing the tiny metastases to proliferate. <br>
<p>
   Dr. Folkman tried to get one of his doctoral or post-doctoral<br>
students to work on that idea. "Each Friday, at our meeting," he said "I<br>
would say, 'Here's a great experiment.' But no one wanted to work on<br>
it." It seemed too wild, Dr. Folkman said, too unlikely to result in<br>
findings that would end up in a scientific journal, a major goal of<br>
young scientists. <br>
<p>
<p>
Undertaking The Big Challenge <br>
<p>
   Then, in 1991, a post-doctoral student, Dr. Michael O'Reilly, decided<br>
to take on the challenge. Dr. O'Reilly focused on a particularly deadly<br>
mouse cancer that grows to the equivalent of a two-pound tumor in a<br>
person. <br>
<p>
   As long as mice had the large tumor, they had no signs of metastases.<br>
But five days after the tumors were surgically removed, metastases<br>
invariably sprang up in the animals' lungs. Within 15 days, the animals<br>
would be dead, their lungs packed with large red tumors, like grapes. <br>
<p>
   Eventually, after arduous work in collaboration with chemists, Dr.<br>
O'Reilly discovered that the large tumors made a substance that stymied<br>
the growth of other tumors. This substance showed up in the animals'<br>
urine, but was present in such minute quantities that Dr. O'Reilly had<br>
to collect 10 quarts of mouse urine to obtain 30-thousandth of an ounce<br>
of the mysterious substance. It turned out to be a piece of a larger and<br>
very common protein, plasminogen, that the body uses in blood clotting.<br>
Dr. Folkman named the new substance angiostatin. <br>
<p>
   Apparently, cells can use the plasminogen gene for two purposes: they<br>
can use it at its full length to make plasminogen, or they can use just<br>
a piece of it and make angiostatin.  Plasminogen does nothing to stop<br>
tumor growth. The question was, would angiostatin? <br>
<p>
   Dr. Folkman and Dr. O'Reilly discovered that angiostatin also<br>
appears, in minute quantities, in human blood. Using outdated human<br>
blood discarded by the Red Cross, they extracted enough angiostatin to<br>
treat mice. Then they began their experiment. <br>
<p>
   They had 20 mice with large tumors on their backs. The investigators<br>
removed the tumors and then injected half of the mice with angiostatin<br>
each day and the others with salt water, as a comparison. <br>
<p>
   After 15 days, the researchers killed the mice and cut them open. As<br>
more than a dozen scientists gathered around a table in the laboratory,<br>
Dr. O'Reilly opened the first mouse. It had huge tumors filling its<br>
lungs.  Then Dr. Folkman checked a notebook to see what the animal had<br>
received: salt water. They looked at the next mouse. No tumors. Dr.<br>
Folkman checked to see the treatment: angiostatin. And so it went. All<br>
10 of the mice that had been injected with angiostatin were free of<br>
cancer. All 10 of those that had been received salt water had huge new<br>
tumors. <br>
<p>
A Jubilant Celebration And a Second Discovery <br>
<p>
   The room was buzzing, the scientists were grinning. Dr. Folkman said.<br>
Everyone in the room knew what the results meant, and they were elated.<br>
They responded, he said, like men at a football game. "Everyone clapped<br>
O'Reilly on the back," Dr. Folkman said. <br>
<p>
   Then the researchers found a second protein fragment, secreted by<br>
tumors, that also squelches metastases, Dr. Folkman said. It was a piece<br>
of a different protein, collagen 18, that is in all blood vessels but by<br>
itself has no effect on cancer. They named the collagen fragment<br>
endostatin. <br>
<p>
 <br>
 <br>
   "It was even more potent than angiostatin," Dr. Folkman said. If he<br>
gave it to a mouse with a huge tumor, he said, the equivalent of one<br>
weighing a pound and a half in a human, endostatin would shrink the<br>
cancer down to a microscopic size. <br>
<p>
   Moreover, tumors never became resistant to endostatin, said Dr.<br>
Folkman, who added that he had given the drug to mice with large tumors<br>
and they had shrunk to almost nothing. He stopped the drug, he said, and<br>
the tumors grew back. Then he gave the drug continuously for the rest of<br>
the animals' lives. The tumors remained small and harmless and the<br>
animals remained healthy. <br>
<p>
   Dr. Robert S. Kerbel, a cancer researcher at Sunnybrook Health<br>
Science Center in Toronto, said he was not surprised that the cancers<br>
never became resistant to endostatin. Tumors become resistant to<br>
chemotherapy drugs, Dr. Kerbel said, because cancer cells constantly<br>
reshuffle their genetic information. The result, he said, is that the<br>
tumors spin off mutant cells that resist the drugs and, ultimately, the<br>
tumors grow back, invulnerable. <br>
<p>
   But, Dr. Kerbel said, angiostatin and endostatin do not act on<br>
tumors. Instead, they act on normal blood vessels that feed tumors. And<br>
normal cells, he said, do not reshuffle their genes and so do not<br>
develop drug resistance. That is why chemotherapy drugs continue to<br>
devastate normal cells -- causing bone marrow suppression, loss of hair,<br>
nausea and vomiting -- even when the cancer cells have grown impervious<br>
to their effects, Dr. Kerbel said. <br>
<p>
Drug Combination Knocks Out Tumors <br>
<p>
   Then Dr. Folkman discovered that he could actually obliterate tumors<br>
in mice with his new drugs. He gave endostatin and angiostatin together,<br>
treating mice for 25 days. To his surprise, Dr. Folkman said, "there was<br>
no tumor left -- we couldn't even find it with a microscope." The<br>
tumors, he said, "were eradicated." <br>
<p>
   And the drugs seem to have no side effects at any stage of life, at<br>
least in mice, something that Dr. Folkman said is hard for researchers<br>
to believe. But, he said, he had given mice up to four times the doses<br>
needed to eliminate cancer and could not find any adverse effects. These<br>
two human proteins may be, he said, "exquisitely aimed -- we do not know<br>
why -- at cancer." <br>
<p>
   In contrast, Dr. Folkman said, mice become very ill when they receive<br>
commonly used chemotherapy -- their hair falls out, they bleed, they<br>
refuse to eat. <br>
<p>
   For the past four years, Dr. Folkman said, he and his colleagues have<br>
found that all tumors responded to the drugs in the same way. Even<br>
leukemia, a blood tumor, responds, he said, because it turns out that<br>
leukemia needs to form new blood vessels in the bone marrow to grow. <br>
Leukemia tumors grow on these blood vessels, "like berries on a bush,"<br>
Dr. Folkman said, shedding cancer cells into the blood. <br>
<p>
   But Dr. Folkman is the first to urge caution in leaping to<br>
conclusions about what might happen when patients try the drugs. "Going<br>
from mice to people is a big jump, with lots of failures," he said. <br>
<p>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hopes were high for chemotherapy drugs that worked well in mice but<br>
turned out to be less successful in people. Therapies that used the<br>
immune system to rid the body of cancer also worked in mice but were<br>
disappointing when they were tried in people. Gene therapy treats mouse<br>
cancer, but has had limited success in people. <br>
<p>
   From bitter experience, most cancer researchers have learned to be<br>
leery of what one called "that four letter word" -- cure. <br>
<p>
   Meanwhile, Entremed is working as fast as it can to produce<br>
angiostatin and endostatin for studies in humans. Dr. John Holaday,<br>
Entremed's president and chief executive, said his company was working<br>
with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company to develop angiostatin and had not<br>
yet decided on a corporate partner to develop endostatin. The drugs are<br>
being made in genetically engineered yeast growing in 20-gallon vats. <br>
<p>
   Dr. Pluda, of the cancer institute, said the first patients to get<br>
the drugs would have cancers that were growing quickly and were<br>
essentially untreatable. The institute will start by giving the drugs<br>
separately by the end of the year, he said, then hopes to combine them. <br>
<p>
   Already, Dr. Folkman said, he gets hundreds of calls a day from<br>
cancer patients, pleading for the drugs. <br>
<p>
   Dr. Folkman, in an interview on Friday, said one call had come from<br>
an old friend from medical school with prostate cancer that had spread<br>
to his bones. <br>
<p>
   "He's terrified," Dr. Folkman said. But there were no strings Dr.<br>
Folkman could pull. He said he had to tell his friend what he told all<br>
the other callers: "You can't get it because it isn't being made." <br>
