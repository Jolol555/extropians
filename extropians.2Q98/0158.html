Suppose technology evolves to the point where people can create new<br>
biological entities in the privacy of their homes.  Biotechnology<br>
allows you to grow an organism with a desired genetic code in an<br>
artificial womb.  You can create people in this way, and modify their<br>
genome any way you like.<br>
<p>
What are the moral issues involved in using this technology?  Here are<br>
some scenarios.  Which if any are immoral?<br>
<p>
 - You use it to grow a child, the offspring of you and your partner,<br>
   with a genome chosen from a random combination of the parents using<br>
   a method which simulates natural fertilization.<br>
<p>
 - You use it to grow a child with a designed genome that has little<br>
   resemblance to your own.  You can give the child special abilities but<br>
   they have some consequential weaknesses.<br>
<p>
 - You use it to grow an organism not fully human, but with a human-like<br>
   mentality - a dog with a human brain, for example.<br>
<p>
 - You use it to create an assortment of subhuman servants, the deltas and<br>
   epsilons of Brave New World.<br>
<p>
I don't have a good answer to these questions.  It seems to me that<br>
intentionally creating a being whose life will involve more suffering<br>
than pleasure is wrong.  The degree of wrongness would relate to how much<br>
suffering there was, and the level of consciousness and intelligence<br>
which perceived the suffering.<br>
<p>
None of the examples above would clearly fall into that category, although<br>
an human-intelligent animal might, depending on how its life turned out.<br>
As in Huxley's novel, the subhuman servants are designed to be happy with<br>
their limited lives.<br>
<p>
By the same reasoning, reckless experimentation which stood a good<br>
chance of suffering would be wrong as well, although not as much so.<br>
Most of the examples above could lead to disastrous outcomes if not done<br>
carefully or if the procedures were not well understood.<br>
<p>
Based on this rather cautious principle, I would tentatively classify<br>
the above procedures as moral, as long as they were done carefully so<br>
that suffering was minimized.<br>
