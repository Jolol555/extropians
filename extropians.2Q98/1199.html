IMO the US represents people *very* poorly because of the huge discrepancy between the<br>
number of people in congress versus the general population - what is it now 450,000 to 1?<br>
Thus the 40% of wealth you talk about does not represent the individual very well at all,<br>
and might as well be considered theft.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  And if reality does not mesh with this</i><br>

<p>
I couldn't agree more.  That's why I'm eliciting responses from free-market guru's!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Outside of that, the claim that 94% of *other* wealth is owned by the</i><br>

<i>&gt; this is obviously a major exclusion and needs to be justified.</i><br>
<p>
As far as I know, the figure quoted by NPR last week does include those pension and mutual<br>
funds.  You are also neglecting the fact that any poor person statistically has a lot less<br>
invested in any particular mutual fund than a rich person.  So these types of percentages<br>
and ratios can still remain.<br>
