Yes, I confused the terms. However, my point remains valid. The article<br>
was about quantum computing, and demonstrates that quantum computing<br>
is still primitive. IMO quantum electronics is also still primitive,<br>
which was the point of departure for the rest of my message, which<br>
argued that nanoelectronics is harder than nanomechanics. Basically<br>
quantum electronics is necessary for both nanoelectronics and<br>
quantum computing, but is not sufficient for quantum computing.<br>
