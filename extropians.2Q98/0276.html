<i>&gt; &gt;Because workers and human beings like Bill Gates or Rockefeller are *not*  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on the same level. Rich people have enough money to build up a firm; there- </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fore for them are to work for wage or to work for their own firms a real  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;alternativ;</i><br>
<p>
You mean rich people like Ray Kroc?  Rich deVoss?  Sam Walton?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; but if you have to work for wage and must spend most of your  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wage for your survive you are not able to earn enough money to build up  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your own firm. Therefore you are forces to earn wage your hole life.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but the three people I named (among a great many others -- <br>
some of whom immigrated to the United States, not speaking English, <br>
possessing only those resources they were able to keep while fleeing <br>
through the jungle or accumulate during years in refugee camps -- <br>
you can't get much poorer than that) did precisely what you <br>
say cannot be done.<br>
<p>
Maybe you didn't recognise the names, though.  <br>
<p>
Ray Kroc was a milkshake-making-machine salesman and repairman, and <br>
from that start he created the McDonald's chain. <br>
<p>
Rich deVoss was a door-to-door soap salesman.  He owns half of Amway. <br>
 (The other half is owned by Jay Van Andel, who was also a <br>
door-to-door soap salesman with a territory nearby.)<br>
<p>
Sam Walton sold various supplies to small-town general stores.  And <br>
created the WalMart chain.<br>
US$500 fee for receipt of unsolicited commercial email. USC 47.5.II.227<br>
