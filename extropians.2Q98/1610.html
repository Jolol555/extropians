<i>&gt;&gt;A Study of Imagination Deficiency in Ten Cases of Skepticism</i><br>

Yes - funny, stylish and deft.  And ouch-making.<br>
<p>
I've been wondering about this paradox myself.  Despite having been an sf<br>
writer by profession for, um, 35 years, I'm clearly `Imagination<br>
Deficient'.  Part of this is what I would justify as<br>
`Dick-Headedness-Intolerant', but part is quite close to what Quinne's<br>
spoof parametrizes.  <br>
<p>
Example: I can cautiously consider the possibility that certain claims of<br>
the paranormal are valid without my head exploding, but I get very, very<br>
angry when my sister-in-law blithely reports that she and her friends can<br>
change the traffic lights green when they wish to.  <br>
<p>
Leaving aside the question of rational adjudication of conflicting claims,<br>
I've been musing on possible links between birth order, family dynamic<br>
ecology, stress levels (measured by cortisol, say), temperament and<br>
radicality.  Frank Solloway's recent amazing work on birth order as a<br>
predictor of response to novelty is a key datum.  So is the recent paper<br>
showing that first-born mice (and, I think, some other lab beasties) are<br>
more skittish, easily stressed, than their later-litter sibs.  Might have<br>
something to do with uterine environment, or with the mother's inexperience.  <br>
<p>
It occurred to me that I (a first born) have a high probability - on<br>
Sulloway's acount - of being narrow, conservative and opposed to change.<br>
My brother Mick, 15 years younger and the family's `baby', should have<br>
turned out neophilic and radical - as indeed he did, in a relaxed and<br>
sardonic way (he's a scathing authority on nuclear tropes in movies and<br>
TV).  But I sort of muddy the picture, being gung-ho for change in some<br>
directions and quite narrow and hostile to innovation in many others.  (I'm<br>
one of those people who find it hard to believe anyone except the mentally<br>
infirm would choose  to wear a baseball hat backwards - it mimics baldness,<br>
never a good look, it leaves you with the sun in your eyes, not a lot of<br>
fun, and it's a marker of herd mentality.)  <br>
<p>
I suspect this might have something to do with anxiety control.   If your<br>
stress set-points are low, from birth, you might arrange your reactions to<br>
the world in a defensive, suspicious way, and if you're intelligent as<br>
well, you might do this by constructing/adopting highly complex, organised<br>
systems of categorisation, evaluation and expression.  More relaxed people<br>
might find it easier to break free, to explore `imaginatively' without the<br>
risk of premature closure.  (If that's true, there'll also be more paranoid<br>
delusives - who might seem at first sight to be wildly imaginative - among<br>
the non-`imaginatives' as well... which is one of the claims in the spoof<br>
article.)<br>
<p>
Are you a later-born, Anders?  Max?  Natasha?  Greg?  Keith?  John?  Anyone?<br>
