I also like Thom's idea.  Perhaps we could have some discussion on which<br>
topics would be most appropriate for the essays.  It would depend on the<br>
target market, right?  Will this be a book aimed at educating the general<br>
public or aimed at extropians (or other transhumanists)?  Maybe we should<br>
consider two books.  Being rather new at this, I haven't been reading the<br>
ExI journal but assume there's lots of potential material there.  Any<br>
general text should certainly have Max More's collection of essays on the<br>
Extropian Principles (first chapter maybe).<br>
