<i>&gt; &gt; TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life that seeks the acceleration of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; development beyond its currently human limitations by means of science,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology, creativity, and other rational means.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I like this, since it suggests that creativity is or can be rational.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure if I like creativity and rational in the same relational context.<br>
Why does it have to be rational?<br>
<p>
I feel as though there's an amendment there which isn't necessary. If you think<br>
about it, you'd have to define rational dynamically to have it really work.<br>
What is the definition of rational if you are a mid-transition posthuman? How<br>
does our ability to rationalize change with our accelerated evolution in flux?<br>
<p>
Perhaps creativity becomes completely rational.<br>
<p>
<p>
Perhaps this is one downside of the posthuman.<br>
