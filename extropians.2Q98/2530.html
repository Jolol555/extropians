<i>        &gt;Religion is connected with believe not with explanations. Either you         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;can believe,  or you can`t.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
I understand that, what I don't understand is why believing in something when <br>
there is no good reason for doing so is supposed to be virtuous.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There won`t ever be an explanation in a real religion.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, and that's exactly why religion is garbage.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why should God create a perfectly suited world for humans? </i><br>
<p>
                 <br>
If God is a sadist then you're correct, there is no reason to expect him to <br>
treat us with kindness.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If there`re no problems and obstacles there can`t be any evolution.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
So what? Evolution is a horribly cruel process, God is omnipotent so He <br>
should not need it to create us, unless He just likes to see us suffer.<br>
<p>
                 <br>
<i>        &gt;The way you express your explanation implies that you don`t believe         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;in the freedom of spirit.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I don't know if I believe in that or not because I don't know what <br>
"freedom of spirit" means.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It`s a matter of opinion if something is good or not.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Then God and religion have nothing to say about morality, we already know <br>
they have nothing intelligent to say about the physical world so the only <br>
conclusion to draw is that the millions of words written by the pious are <br>
utterly vacuous.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you think like this, you`ll never be religious. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Thanks, I hope you're right.<br>
<p>
                 <br>
On a completely different matter, on Friday morning at 7 am EST Showtime will <br>
run a movie about the life of Richard Feynman called "Infinity". I thought it <br>
was excellent but it's hard to find, I can't imagine why it didn't make a <br>
bigger splash when it was in the theaters 2 years ago, I couldn't even rent <br>
it on video tape. I liked The Truman Show but this is better.<br>
