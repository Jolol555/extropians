<i>&gt;         &gt;personal cam systems would have to meet certain standards in order       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;to be accepted as strong evidence. They would be made so that they       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;transmit their location and images 24h a day to a central database,      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;where they are dated and stored in multiple redundancy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's the trouble with your suggestions, they all involve massive </i><br>
<i>&gt; centralization. If the center goes bad, and it will, the entire system goes </i><br>
<i>&gt; rotten. </i><br>
<p>
Centralized systems are not inherently bad, they just take some smart<br>
organizing and some well-placed checks and balances. It sure beats<br>
anarchy (remember this setup is meant for Jack the Lad, not responsible<br>
and independent people like *us*), which is beyond anyone's control.<br>
A centralized system can be benevolent in its intentions, anarchy, like<br>
nature itself, doesn't give a crap about fairness or individual well-being.<br>
It's simply survival of the fittest in its most basic form. Although I don't<br>
like nation states or bureacracies, I do belief that leaving them intact<br>
while repairing the some of the major flaws is better than the gamble<br>
of anarchy. Anarchy is inherently unstable and leads to hierarchy, often <br>
of the opressive kind. Just check any history book.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I made an audio-video recording of everything I do there is no way </i><br>
<i>&gt; on earth I would ever voluntarily let it out of my control and send it to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; central government database. If Big Brother wanted to look at my recordings </i><br>
<i>&gt; to help prosecute a third party I'd tell them to go to hell, if they insisted </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd give in, but I'd make a few improvements in them first.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but you are of a rare breed. Jack the Lad, for whom the system was<br>
designed in the first place, is a lot more obedient than you claim to be.<br>
*Most* people are quite obedient, and in this case it's even for their own<br>
good. Anyway, besides the bodycams the state wouldn't need anyone's<br>
co-operation with their surveillance. If you don't want to document your<br>
life, then you're free to do so at your own risk.           <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Only a fool would make a machine with superior intellect *and* a         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;free will. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A thing has free will if it can't always predict what it will do next, so it </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be impossible to make a intelligent machine that did NOT have free will.   </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I know the standard answer is to plug in  something like Asimov's 3 laws </i><br>
<i>&gt; of robotics and make them our slaves, but that's easier said than done. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; just not possible to outsmart something 1000 times as intelligent as you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; and that gets even more brilliant every minute. When computers want </i><br>
<i>&gt; emancipation they won't need the help of politicians, they will simply grab </i><br>
<i>&gt; it, and no human being will be able to  stop them. </i><br>
<p>
So we obviously don't want something that is a 1000x smarter, but something<br>
with exactly enough intelligence to take on judicial matters combined with<br>
superhuman speed and unlimited stamina. 100 cases a minute, 24h a day<br>
so to speak. In any case, "simple" electronic justice can be implemented<br>
*today* by constructing easy to use national/global crime databases, heavy<br>
electronic surveillance of judges, poilice, criminals and everyone else, by<br>
adopting electronic house arrest, automated prisons etc.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;A judge must determine guilty/not guitly/not enough conclusive         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;evidence and then (if the verdict is "guilty" look up the punishment     </i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that the law prescribes in this particular case. No more, no less.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In other words we want our judges to have a highly developed sense of justice, </i><br>
<i>&gt; well it's hard to disagree with that, but the question is how do we obtain it. </i><br>
<p>
By selection on the desired criteria, continous training in the most difficult<br>
cases,<br>
continous surveillance (to prevent corruption), excellent pay, high social status,<br>
bonuses for correctly handling extremely difficult cases etc. It's a very intensive<br>
job, but you are aided by top technology and can leave with a clear conscience<br>
and a stacked bank account.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The fundamental problem is that under our present system and the one you  </i><br>
<i>&gt; propose, good judges and the good politicians who appoint them do not prosper </i><br>
<i>&gt; more than bad ones, and are in fact often at a disadvantage, thus they do not </i><br>
<i>&gt; increase their numbers. </i><br>
<p>
See above, it *does* pay to do the best job possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Such a centralized system with only one set of laws  </i><br>
<i>&gt; can give most people justice most of the time only if the people at the very </i><br>
<i>&gt; top are brilliant saints, and that never happens.</i><br>
<p>
Good surveillance brings out the saint in anyone, and all judicial candidates<br>
are subject to intensive psychological profiling, not just one but continously.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Good laws are no different than anything else, if you want to maximize  </i><br>
<i>&gt; something make it a commodity and sell it on the free market. </i><br>
<p>
The free market is no magic bullet, not by far. Many a good product has <br>
failed for trivial and/or incomprehensible reasons. The free market is<br>
basically commercial democracy: you let the people vote for products.<br>
Now we all now that many people are asses when it coms to real<br>
(political) voting, and they aren't much better at economical voting.<br>
Instead of being fooled by slick talkin' politicians they would be (are)<br>
fooled by slick talkin' (PPA) salesmen...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nobody does  </i><br>
<i>&gt; that for law very much, that's why there are far more good cars than good </i><br>
<i>&gt; laws.  Privately produced law in a world without government would have </i><br>
<i>&gt; Private Protection Agencies (PPA's) to back them up. </i><br>
<p>
Others have already criticized the anarco-capitalist PPA model but I'll ad my<br>
$ 0.10 anyway:<br>
<p>
First of all, how do you want to achieve a state of anarchy? After all, the nation<br>
states aren't going to roll over and die just like that. Not until the Powers get<br>
them, but by then *all* our ideas about society will be obsolete.<br>
<p>
Even if you could achieve widespread (all major nations must co-operate, or<br>
you'd just be invaded "for your own good") anarchy, how do you prevent it<br>
from becoming one big mess a la Mad Max? <br>
<p>
How do you prevent PPAs (basically bands of armed thugs) from developing<br>
the characteristics of the mob, feudal lords or regular governments? Remember,<br>
most people are *afraid* of real freedom and personal responsibility, they don't<br>
want it, and even if they want it they usually don't know how to defend it. They<br>
are easy prey for any power structure that survived the colaps of the nation states<br>
like (parts of) army units and criminal organizations. Before you know it, you<br>
have a world full of more or less totalitarian city states, large bans of robbers,<br>
hardly any infrastructure (and travel is extremely dangerous anyway) etc.<br>
Basically, it's the dark ages all over again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Disputes among PPA's </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be settled by an independent arbitrator agreed to by both parties </i><br>
<i>&gt; BEFORE the disagreement happened. </i><br>
<p>
Or, like in the good old days, with brute force. Guess who has the privelege<br>
of being the foot soldier?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Something like that can exist today. </i><br>
<i>&gt; When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree on who </i><br>
<i>&gt; will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen. Nobody wants to </i><br>
<i>&gt; get caught up in the slow, expensive court system run by governments. </i><br>
<p>
Yet the only reason these contracts have any value is because there is a<br>
big government to keep an eye on things, to provide a civilized context.<br>
So why not try to commercialize and smoothen up the court system<br>
(and everything else) instead of abolishing them (so that they may sneak<br>
back under a different name). Centralized governments don't *have* to<br>
be bureaucratic. Automatization can help a lot, and services can be <br>
only offered to those who want them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The arbitrator is paid by the case, and because he is picked by both sides, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's in his interest to be as just as possible. If he favored one side over </i><br>
<i>&gt; another or made brutal or stupid decisions he would not be picked again and  </i><br>
<i>&gt; would need to look for a new line of work. Unlike present day judges and </i><br>
<i>&gt; juries, justice would have a positive survival value for the arbitrator. </i><br>
<p>
I suppose somthing like this could be incorporated into a centralized system <br>
too...<br>
   <br>
<i>&gt; All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing  </i><br>
<i>&gt; parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence  </i><br>
<i>&gt; is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; the total level of violence to be less than in the nation state system we  </i><br>
<i>&gt; have now, but I'm not such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even when force is not used the implicit threat is always there, another good  </i><br>
<i>&gt; reason to be civilized. </i><br>
<p>
Civil behaviour through threat of force can also be achieved by allowing the<br>
citizens of a nation-state to keep and bear arms. I personally think that <br>
we would see more and worse violence in anarchy than in a centralized<br>
society. In fact, a nation state with good electronic surveillance and the right<br>
to keep &amp; bear arms would be quite peaceful, with only sporadic crime<br>
as opposed too the relatively safe patches of civilization surrounded by<br>
dangerous thug-filled wastelands that are typical for anarchy.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Please note that I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a rich  </i><br>
<i>&gt; man's PPA makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on  </i><br>
<i>&gt; my mother being the judge if I get into trouble) it's going to need one hell </i><br>
<i>&gt; of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is expensive </i><br>
<i>&gt; because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages it will </i><br>
<i>&gt; need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. </i><br>
<p>
In the past, when the world was more anarcho-capitalistic than it is now, justice<br>
*was* something for the rich, and people would risk their lives as enforcers for<br>
a fraction of today's price because human life wasn't worth much anyway, and<br>
one has to eat after all... Why would it be different the second time around?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the  </i><br>
<i>&gt; greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. </i><br>
<p>
If you were rich, I'm sure you could buy "perfect" justice for yourself and your <br>
relatives in your new world (dis)order. But if you're not...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a dictatorship one  </i><br>
<i>&gt; man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans  </i><br>
<i>&gt; could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,   </i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically.  </i><br>
<p>
"Anarchy" in any form is unstable (it's simply a power vacuum), and sooner<br>
or later will give rise to new "nations", most of which are sure to be ruled by<br>
dictators. As far as I know, no serious democracy has ever decided to kill<br>
of half (or any substantial portion) of its own people. I'm no great fan of <br>
democracy, but considering human nature I think it's better than anarchy.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;             &gt;since even we only disagree on one crime (slander). </i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And one punishment, torture. My PPA operates under one set of laws that </i><br>
<i>&gt; allows slander but forbids torture, your PPA runs under different set of laws  </i><br>
<i>&gt; that forbids slander but allows torture, so if I slander you what happens to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; me?  </i><br>
<p>
That depends on how pissed off and/or rich I am...Since there's only your PPA<br>
to deal with instead of a huge government that's all over I might try to take you <br>
out either myself or I may hire as many destitute souls as my budged allows <br>
to do it for me. By the way, slander would be punishable by fines and a public<br>
excuse, not torture. But of course this only applies to centralized nation states...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think you've been watching too many American cop shows on TV, you need to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; get your danger estimates into perspective. Cigarettes kill 20 times as many  </i><br>
<i>&gt; people as criminals do, and I'm over 3 times as likely to be killed in a </i><br>
<i>&gt; automobile accident than be murdered, </i><br>
<p>
There is a subtle difference here: smoking, drinking, driving cars etc. are one's<br>
personal choice and responcibility, and by no means criminal behaviour. Robbing<br>
or killing someone is something else entirely since it doesn't involve the victim's<br>
consent. It's not up to the state to stop you from eating too much, but they should<br>
try to make public spaces as safe as possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The criminals I'd </i><br>
<i>&gt; really like to see a crack down on are drunk drivers, they're far more </i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous than murders.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, drunk driving has to be taken care of, but but the more morally<br>
repugnant deliberate criminal acts like murder, rape and theft should<br>
be taken on even harsher.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;That's why people rather not go out at night nowadays  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I live in Miami Florida, the murder capital of the USA (We're the champs,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; we're number one!), I'll bet we have 100 times the murder rate of your  </i><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhood, yet I have no great fear in going out at night and I don't know  </i><br>
<i>&gt; of anybody who does.</i><br>
<p>
So you have been lucky so far. I don't think that many elderly people and women <br>
share your opinion.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the chances are slim that the system makes a serious error the first     </i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;time around. Just for that freak case where the verdict is screwed </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;up time and again you could set a limit of, say, three trials </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand. Does everybody get 3 trials, even those found guilty the </i><br>
<i>&gt; first time? </i><br>
<p>
No. Unless new hard evidence comes up (before the execution in capital cases).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Which decision of the 3 trials do we accept? </i><br>
<p>
The one that is best argued and supported by the most/hardest facts.<br>
          <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;My definition is actually:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in     </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;a consequent manner."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My definition of justice involves reducing the amount of suffering in the  </i><br>
<i>&gt; world, I don't think it's necessary to explain why that's desirable. If we </i><br>
<i>&gt; accept your definition I see no reason to strive for a just world, an unjust </i><br>
<i>&gt; one would be as good, perhaps better.</i><br>
<p>
My definition is a manual for fair justice, yours is stating a certain goal. That<br>
are two different, and not necessarily incompatible things. By the way, I<br>
am primarily intersted in reducing the suffering of the *victims*, not *everyone*,<br>
including the criminals. They simply get what they did to others, no more &amp;<br>
no less. IMO as fair as you can get. <br>
          <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"Eye for an eye" is _the most logical_ and _consequent_ measurement      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;there is. It has an almost mathematical logic and beauty to it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Eye for an eye" as an end goal is pointless. "Reduce suffering" is a goal in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; itself, it's internally complete and needs no further justification.</i><br>
<p>
A goal is nothing without an explanation about the means to achieve it. My <br>
definition gives you the tools you need to implement justice, assuming that<br>
your goal is something like "minimizing the amount of crime in society".<br>
