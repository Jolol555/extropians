It's easy to be a psychic.  All you have to do is get set up to take<br>
credit card numbers over the phone.  As a credit-accepting merchant, you<br>
can arrange access to look up customer's credit records online as they<br>
call.  By looking at the caller's credit records, the psychic has<br>
instant information about you, including:<br>
<p>
Your current address, and a history of your addresses:  "I sense that<br>
you just moved from the desert southwest to a place near an ocean, maybe<br>
6-8 months ago...  I sense that you move every 2-3 years."<br>
<p>
Your current salary, and a history of your salaries:  "I sense that you<br>
just got a raise...  I sense that you frequently get raises..."<br>
<p>
Credit problems and late bills:  "I feel that you started having money<br>
problems recently.  I sense that you had plenty of money, and your<br>
problems didn't start until this year..."<br>
<p>
Creditors and new accounts:  "I see that you just bought a new sports<br>
car...  I also see a hospital stay last year...  Did you have a death or<br>
some kind of funeral arrangements two years ago?...  I sense you working<br>
with realtors, and maybe moving into a new house very soon!...  I see<br>
you starting to work out at the Gym, and starting to take sky-diving<br>
lessons!...."<br>
<p>
Types of creditors or purchases:  "I see you working with lots of<br>
computer equipment...  You just bought a lot of new equipment...  I<br>
sense $10,000's worth just last month!..."<br>
<p>
900-numbers:  "I feel you are a lonely person...  I see you calling<br>
900-sex lines seeking companionship...  This started three or four<br>
months ago..."<br>
<p>
Long distance credit card calls:  "I see you traveling out of the<br>
country a lot...  I sense you were in asia this past year....  You were<br>
in Paris just recently..."<br>
<p>
You get the idea.  I want to be your Psychic Dog!  Send me your credit<br>
card numbers now.  My spirit-guide tells me you want to!  The first 10<br>
minutes is FREE FREE FREE while I look up your credit history!  The<br>
extremely gullible can qualify for extra charges!<br>
