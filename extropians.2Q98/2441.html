My employer has a technology research facility in Palo Alto, and I'm trying<br>
to get there. Luckily, I've found a well-connected manager who can assist<br>
me, but since he has to go through the world-wide head of technology for<br>
the company he needs me to produce a short paper showing my abilities.<br>
<p>
I intend to write a paper on uploading. The head of technology is an<br>
Extropian-savvy person, to whom uploading will not sound like a 'way-out'<br>
concept.<br>
<p>
So... can you please suggest some good sources of information for the paper<br>
either on the Net, or in print, or, best of all, in the form of friendly<br>
researchers in this area who could provide nice sound bites. I need to<br>
write a presentation which is very up-to-date and though-provoking. My<br>
writing abilities are up to the job, but I need a little assistance with<br>
the content. Right now, I could put together something informed, coherent<br>
and well-structured: but it need to be a little more than that.<br>
<p>
Going to Palo Alto is important to me in both personal and Extropian ways.<br>
Any help would be very, very greatly appreciated.<br>
<p>
Many thanks,<br>
<p>
Sarah Marr<br>
