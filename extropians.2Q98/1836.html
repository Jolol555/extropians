I apologize for sending the bulk of this post twice; but I dispatched <br>
the last one before I intended to.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; I would separate meditation from relaxation although they share the </i><br>
same<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; basis. In fact, meditation seems to be relaxation combined with a </i><br>
high<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; level of awareness. Contrary to relaxation (which often occurs while</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; sitted on an armchair, laying on a bed eyes closed, or even on the </i><br>
floor<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; as in the yogic savasana posture), meditation includes some tension</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which have to be maintained during the whole session : the back</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; straight, eyes open, hands or whole body in strange and hard to </i><br>
maintain<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; postures, etc. </i><br>
<p>
   This is not true of all meditation procedures.  Transcendental <br>
Meditation is a technique which calls for no particular posture, <br>
breathing control, or other bodily behavior. The only thing that all <br>
meditative techniques have in common is that they are used to acheive <br>
transcendental states, i.e., meditation is defined functionally.  It's <br>
like the definition of a chair; it may or may not have four legs, three <br>
legs, a lower back support, any legs at all, but it is definately <br>
something that you sit on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The tension is likely necessary to keep the awareness high; if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;falters and begins to move towards relaxation (which tends to decrease</i><br>
<i>&gt;awareness as we slip into normal rest/sleep) we get a mechanical</i><br>
<i>&gt;response (sagging back, a sudden touch as the fingers move or the need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to realign the posture) that alerts us to this. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
   In Zen monasteries, masters facilitate this process.  Whenever they <br>
observe a meditating monk is losing concentration and posture, the <br>
master delivers a smack with a wooden stick.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Martial art can even be seen as medtation occuring in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stressing environment of fight!</i><br>
<p>
Some skilled martial artists will occasionally go into brief moments of <br>
transcendence during combat, essentially amnesiatic fugues in which the <br>
body carries on its tasks without conscious awareness. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I really like the japanese idea of finding meditation potential in all</i><br>
<i>&gt;sorts of tasks, not just traditional meditation forms but in martial</i><br>
<i>&gt;art, everyday work or various ceremonies. I wonder if we could develop</i><br>
<i>&gt;a form of meditation for studying?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; if meditation is "created" by changing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the parameters of relaxation, we can perhaps change meditation by </i><br>
adding<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; some new elements created especially in the purpose of increasing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; intelligence. for instance, combine meditation with Ars memoria, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; doing martial arts movements to navigate in an abstract virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interface representing some mathematical or scientifical truthes, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; little like the tai-chi experiment at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   this page : <a href="http://dbecker.www.media.mit.edu/~dbecker/">http://dbecker.www.media.mit.edu/~dbecker/</a></i><br>
<p>
  This would definately be a change.  I don't think it could be called <br>
meditation afterwards.  Meditation is intended to produce transcendental <br>
experiences, at least in the major meditative schools.  The fundamental <br>
property of transcendental consciousness (also called the introverted <br>
mystical experience) is the complete abscence of any defining <br>
characteristics.  If a concept of mathematical and scientific truths <br>
persist, then there can't be nothing, and thus it is not a <br>
transcendental experience.  However, I am not saying that such a goal is <br>
necesarily far from meditation.  It is reported in various meditation <br>
literature that in states very close to transcendence highly abstract <br>
and mathematical concepts persist after all the more gross thoughts and <br>
sensations have disappeared.   DesCartes' Meditations may be an example <br>
of a state of consciousness just short of transcendence where all <br>
awareness of the environment has disappeared but pure individuality and <br>
abstract reasoning persist.  The increase in pure intellect you seek may <br>
be found fluctuation around the transcendental moments of pure <br>
meditation.<br>
