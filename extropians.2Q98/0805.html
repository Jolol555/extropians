I don't know who is on the chatsubo or COMMUNET listserves, or gets <br>
forwards from Curt, this is an interesting conference taking place in <br>
Los Angeles, though I'd send it on...<br>

Prof. Nadia Thalmann<br>
Prof. Daniel Thalmann<br>
Bernie Roehl, and other members of the VRML H-anim group.<br>
<p>
The Metaborg Consortium is an emerging international initiative which<br>
aims<br>
to bring together the principal v-humans standards activities, so that<br>
software subsystems from different developers can be integrated into<br>
composite v-humans ('Metaborgs') and readily incorporated into<br>
applications. The Consortium will produce and demonstrate reference<br>
implementations of multiple-source virtual humans, define standard APIs,<br>
and guide the formal standards-making processes.<br>
<p>
Initial participants comprise the research labs and standards groups<br>
represented by the speaker panel, together with Prof. Loftin's VETLab at<br>
the University of Houston, which has agreed in principle to act as the<br>
primary independent integration, administration and support center for<br>
the<br>
Consortium. Other Executive Members of the Consortium are expected to<br>
comprise major applications developers. There will additionally be<br>
membership categories for academic and commercial groups interested in<br>
participating or receiving information.<br>
<p>
In this session the panelists will outline current standards activity,<br>
discuss integration requirements, problems and opportunities, and seek<br>
the<br>
views of the audience on plans for the Consortium.<br>

9.00-9.30am<br>
<p>
Prof. Michael Zyda, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California<br>
<p>
Computer-generated characters are part of every videogame and defense<br>
simulation. We need such characters as intelligent opponents to live<br>
players in videogames. We need such characters for fully automated<br>
simulations. The Department of Defense and the Entertainment Industry<br>
share<br>
common desires for computer-generated characters and can, perhaps, have a<br>
common research agenda. In this presentation, we outline the desires of<br>
the<br>
two communities for computer-generated characters and the scope of the<br>
research agenda necessary to achieve those desires.<br>
<p>

cohabits a virtual world with students.<br>
Steve's objective is to help students learn to perform physical,<br>
procedural<br>
tasks, such as operating and maintaining complex equipment. He can<br>
demonstrate tasks, explaining his actions, and can monitor students<br>
performing tasks, providing help when they need it.<br>
