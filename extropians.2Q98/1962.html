<p>
As a casual observer, your "holism" is trivial.  It proves nothing that<br>
atomism does not, and makes no predictions that atomism would not.  All<br>
you're saying is that A + -A = 0.  Add A to both sides and you get A = A,<br>
the atomist prediction.  YOU'RE SAYING THE SAME THING.<br>
<p>
Your presumption that A + -A = 0 somehow proves the mystical experience is<br>
hogwash; the mystical experience is that A = -A because A = 0 and A- = 0. <br>
The mystical experience demands that all things are all things, not that<br>
the sum of all things is zero. <br>
<p>
To show that the mystical experience holds true, you must show that 1 IS<br>
0, not that the sum of the identity of 1 and not-1 is the same as the sum<br>
of the identity of 0 and not-0 (which is trivially true), but that the<br>
identity of 1 is equal to the identity of 0.  Similarly, showing that the<br>
sum of the differences in location with respect to multiple objects is<br>
zero is again trivial; the mystical experience demands that all such<br>
values actually BE zero.  Same goes for time.<br>
<p>
So, as an example of atomism working, I posit: everything holism predicts.<br>
