I'm still not convinced this is "everybody wanting the power."  I<br>
originally said this is "how" a stable anarchy could exist, the<br>
likelihood of it doing so is highly remote.  And the events leading up<br>
to these transitions are unlikely.<br>
<p>
Besides gangs, what you talk of can be applied to voters.  If you<br>
can't be in the big chair, you want someone similar to be there instead.<br>
<p>
This may seem strange, but as we approach better forms of government<br>
the likelihood of anarchy increases.  The better a government is the<br>
more political diversity (as people concentrate on smaller and smaller<br>
problems that create a greater number of divides in opinion.)  The<br>
more political diversity the less likely gangs and organisations will<br>
appear.  Add to this a degree of paranoia, and you could solve the<br>
problems of organisation and have the system collapse into stable<br>
anarchy.<br>

[property...]<br>
<i>&gt; Without private property, why do people</i><br>
<i>&gt; cooperate?</i><br>
<p>
They have no choice but to share resources with everyone who wants<br>
them.  It may not be formal co-operation, but it is co-operation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The purpose of work is gain the resources</i><br>
<i>&gt; to survive and do what you *really* want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do.</i><br>
<p>
It's economic Darwinism, but that doesn't make it the only way of<br>
doing things.  This is after all, the extropian list where we talk<br>
about doing things differently.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The dancer has no right to say that for</i><br>
<i>&gt; this period each day the dance studio he</i><br>
<i>&gt; built is *not* available as a place for</i><br>
<i>&gt; small children to play.</i><br>
<p>
I think you've jumped ahead of yourself here.<br>
<p>
Private Property: The government enforces the individuals right to own<br>
property.<br>
<p>
No Private Property: The government does not enforce the individuals<br>
right to own property.<br>
<p>
Anti-Private Property: The government enforces the properties right<br>
not to be owned.<br>
<p>
With no private property you can protect your right to anything you<br>
wish.  As I said anarchy is about the illusion of freedom, you're<br>
never going to be truly free someone somewhere is always going to be<br>
after your dance floor.<br>
<p>
['Archy...]<br>
<i>&gt; A perfect social or political system, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; all systems I have examined, requires</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfect people in some quantity --</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictatorship being the best in this regard</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it requires the fewest perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; people, and anarchy among the worst</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it requires that the overwhelming</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority -- possibly everyone -- be</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfect.  In this part of the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfect people are a rather scarce item,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and what I read in the newspapers doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell me that this is a strictly local</i><br>
<i>&gt; shortage.</i><br>
<p>
Your reasoning is sound but doesn't take subjectivity into account. <br>
'Perfection' is probably the most subjective term you can think of.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, a governments role is to make life cosy for it's people<br>
so they can get on with the important stuff (like nanotechnology and<br>
space travel) without worrying where their next meals coming from. <br>
Unfortunately, about 80% of what a modern government does is to keep<br>
itself in power (the latest war, the latest drug scare, etc.)  The<br>
concept of such a government is sound transhumanism.<br>
<p>
This email has allowed me to build a coherent (but complex) political<br>
system:<br>
<p>
The "anarcho-centralist" wants everyone to serve his or her needs but<br>
also recognises everyone else's want to do the same.<br>
