On Fox News a week or two ago, there was a doctor who had a magnetic pulse<br>
device he was using to treat severe depression. The transducer was what<br>
appeared to be a ferrite C-core with perhaps a dozen turns of heavy wire,<br>
connected to a cable running to a large cabinet. The device made cracking<br>
noises (capacitor discharge?) at about a 5 to 10 Hertz rate.<br>
<p>
He was heard saying to the patient that she would notice twitching in her<br>
extremities when he found the right spot..<br>
<p>
It actually seems to do some good, but I have no idea whether there have<br>
been any actual studies done to remove the placebo effect as a reason.<br>
