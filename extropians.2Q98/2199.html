Sarah: A slightly belated "welcome back" to the list. I've missed your<br>
contributions.<br>
<p>
Let me note here, for those of you who don't know, that the NodeNet grew<br>
out of an idea that was originally Sarah's a couple of years ago. Sarah<br>
discussed her idea with Greg Burch while he was in England, then Greg went<br>
on to refine the idea. We have now simplified the workings in order to make<br>
it feasible to actually get it implemented.<br>

<p>
My own perspective on this is that the NodeNet forums should incorporate a<br>
reasonable degree of exclusivity. We do indeed want to build a strong<br>
reputation for ExI. The lists will not be open to all. They will be<br>
restricted to ExI members, and only those applying members whom each<br>
NodeMaster deems appropriate or qualified for a forum. However, to address<br>
Reilly's concern, the criteria of "qualified" will vary for each list. Even<br>
if desirable (and I agree it is not), qualifications need not be academic<br>
degrees. (Requiring higher -- or any -- degree in relevant fields, given<br>
the size of ExI's membership, would guarantee very little participation!) <br>
<p>
For highly technical forums, we probably want to be more restrictive in<br>
allowing members to be posting-enabled Participants. Here, either a formal<br>
background in the topic, or demonstrated knowledge in writings, previous<br>
email list postings, etc. would count. For other forums, especially highly<br>
cross-disciplinary ones, or more practically focused ones, the default<br>
might be that all applicants can be participants, with the NodeMaster<br>
merely screening out those who have shown little substantive imput in the<br>
past.<br>
<p>
I will work with each NodeMaster on setting out both a mission statement<br>
and qualification filters for each forum. I hope we will also continue to<br>
discuss it here (or on the Extropians-Select list once that's up).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Second, with multiple, highly-specific nodes, how is ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt;to ensure that 'cross-pollenation' of ideas occurs effectively?</i><br>
<p>
That's the job of the Extropians-Select and Extropians-Open lists, as well<br>
as publications in Extropy Online, and conversations at local events and<br>
EXTRO conferences.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
