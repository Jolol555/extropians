It may not correlate well, but can you possible say it does not correlate at all? Ants<br>
are less intelligent than rats which are corresponding less intelligence than dogs which<br>
are less intelligent than gorillas.  There is definitely *some* correlation.  Speech<br>
modality is distinct from language.  Elephants don't have the laryngeal design to<br>
variate sound waves, birds do.  Besides,  dolphins do produce immense variation in<br>
sound.<br>

If brain size didn't matter at all, then lusting after jupiter brains would be<br>
meaningless.<br>

The key difference is in that 30 million years our brain size went from a small monkeys<br>
to what it is now.  During the same time period, cetaceans had already achieved brain<br>
sizes larger than ours at present.<br>

<p>
As far as I know the cross-section of data is pretty small - insufficient to determine<br>
anything yet.<br>

<p>
I'm not sure if it true either.  My point is *if* they have a complex language that is<br>
descriptive beyond the means of survival, then it could resemble something akin to an<br>
oral tradition.<br>
