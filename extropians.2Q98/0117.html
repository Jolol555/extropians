<i>&gt; If you just take away private property, then the government, who is no more</i><br>

<p>
whoever said there would be a government around?  <br>
BTW, i don't think this has been done countless times throughout history.<br>
I can't come up with even ten events where 10 million people were directly<br>
wiped out by a government.  Actually i can't come up with 5 but i think<br>
that's more to do with my extremely limmited knowledge of anything that<br>
did not happen in the 20th century (where my knowledge moves up to<br>
the "very limmited" category)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I presume you mean to topple the state, too...  But if you try the</i><br>
<i>&gt; revolutionary tactic many anarcho-socialists suggest, the general consensus</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that people will be only MORE likely to embrace totalitarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Revolution is dangerous and chaotic.  People beg for strong leadership</i><br>
<i>&gt; during these periods...  we'll *definitely* be right back where we started,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because there won't be ANYTHING to stop it, not even the possibility of a PPA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
general consensus?  by whom? again, your argumentative style leaves much<br>
to be desired.  you could try using less "definitely"s and other such wide<br>
sweeping statements and try slightly more concrete or better thought out<br>
ideas. <br>
I, just one case i suppose, would not beg for strong leadership.  i really<br>
don't know how a mostly educated and wealthy western type population would<br>
react to this scenario, since i don't think its been tried before.  please<br>
correct me on this, since as i said before, my history knowledge is<br>
sketchy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;portionof the population.  Great wealth is not a certificate of sanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, you're right, it's not a certificate of sanity.  Neither is holding a</i><br>
<i>&gt; public office, sadly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
i might state it again: i don't support centralised governments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But consider this, Mr. left-anarchist.  Remember Bakunin?  (Hint:  Don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminate money to make the state fall away, eliminate the state and let</i><br>
<i>&gt; MONEY fall away.)  Anarcho-socialist communes, group societies, etc. could</i><br>
<i>&gt; all exist, live and thrive under anarcho-capitalism.  If they're more</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosperous than a capitalist system, they will even be more abundant than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the PPA system.  </i><br>
<p>
i agree, but with one big condition: evenly distributed wealth as a start<br>
point.  There are natural advantages of mass production which i don't<br>
think would be compensated for in a free market system, or if it did, it<br>
would take an extremely long time, and i don't really like asymptotic<br>
solutions.  otoh, anarcho-capitalist "societies" could also exist in an<br>
anarcho-socialist world, and if they are more effective then they would<br>
also thrive and multiply<br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you support a society with no state and no private property, you should</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminate the state first, in a slow, peaceful manner; then, if you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; right, private property should fall away as the more efficient and</i><br>
<i>&gt; generally superior socialist communes spread like wild fire.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
that is pretty much what i'm hoping will happen with the help of nanotech.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So would you at least consider looking at anarcho-capitalism in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; way that true communists wanted to look at authoritarian socialism, as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; intermediary step towards the final goal?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
again, with wealth redistribution, no problem.  without it i don't think<br>
it's a sufficiently big step.  i admit that wealth redistribution isn't an<br>
easy task, but again, nanotech might (hopefully) have something to say<br>
about this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Under anarcho-capitalism slaughter is harder than it is now; but if it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; really really easy now, then there's not quite as much we can do about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anarcho-socialism won't help this, either, sadly.</i><br>
<p>
it would definitely help, since there wouldn't be anyone powerful enough<br>
to do anything of such magnitude.  And i don't think anarcho-capitalism<br>
makes slaughter any harder than it is now<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And for reasons i explained earlier it is very likely it WOULD win, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more likely, that no war would occur, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or that if there was a war and it didn't then you wouldn't come out any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;better. i've already stated it twice.  check my response to Dan Fabulich's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;posts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, your conception of the situation was completly incorrect.  Say my</i><br>
<i>&gt; PPA (PPA-1) decided to become tyrannical.  PPA-2, we agree, will interfere</i><br>
<i>&gt; only if it will earn them a profit; they will win only if they make more</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit than PPA-1 would otherwise.  In light of this, I offer PPA-2</i><br>
<i>&gt; slightly MORE than I used to pay PPA-1, and I refuse to pay PPA-1.  From</i><br>
<i>&gt; there, PPA-2 has the means and the incentive to protect me from PPA-1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
if i remember correctly, it was i who described what i thought your PPA<br>
would be able to do.  again, if i remember correctly, i did not use the<br>
word tyrannical.  i did describe a PPA which would be able to control you,<br>
by which i meant that it could make you pay, even if you did not want to<br>
and wouldn't let you switch to another PPA (i realise now where the<br>
tyrannical and other assumptions come from, i'm sorry for the confusion).<br>
now, from this scenario:  PPA is getting x units per second from you as<br>
pay.  you want to pay y where y &lt; x.  Another PPA would be willing to be<br>
paid y, but it would not be able to get you out of your current PPA's<br>
control since your current PPA would be willing to spend f(x) (where f(x)<br>
is a monotonically increasing function which refers to what a company<br>
thinks you are worth) on protecting you while the other would only be<br>
willing to spend f(y) toget you.  f(y) &lt; f(x), so you are stuck where you<br>
are.  If you are willing to spend z, where z &gt; x, then, yes, you will be<br>
taken out of your current PPA's control, and put under another PPA's<br>
control which charges you z, but they have to make sure that they recoup<br>
what they lost in getting you which has to be greater than f(x).  so,<br>
unless your current controlling PPA is stupid and doesn't know how to<br>
calculate the f function, then you'd end up spending more on your new one<br>
than on your current one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;i didn't claim that.  Stalin is not exactly the average guy in a position</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of power right now.  That Bill Gates under PPA anarcho-capitalism (PPAAC?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would have more influence than John Howard (Australia's PM, just in case)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;has right now, i would say most definitely.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; John Howard is a poor choice...  A better choice would be someone like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; head of the Australian military, who, we imagine, actually could take over</i><br>
<i>&gt; the country given his position.  Howard could not do this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
no, i don't think that the head of the australian military could, unless<br>
it got support from the us military.  but even if he could, i think there<br>
would be more (or at least the same) number of people who could take that<br>
decision in an anarcho-capitalist system as in the current one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway, the point is this:  Yes, Bill Gates would have a lot of power under</i><br>
<i>&gt; A-C, but there are plenty of people who wield incredible powers today</i><br>
<i>&gt; (military generals, etc.) who have no checks on their power.  No system of</i><br>
<i>&gt; political checks and balances can overcome this; so long as the military</i><br>
<i>&gt; exists, it can simply choose to reject the laws set down by the politicians</i><br>
<i>&gt; and take over the country.  Anarcho-capitalism is the only way to even sort</i><br>
<i>&gt; of begin to limit the effects of this power, by allowing people to choose</i><br>
<i>&gt; between competing protection agencies, rather than being stuck with just one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
i agree with everything until the last sentence.  why does a ppa have less<br>
power than the army?  don't they fill exactly the same role?  consider the<br>
colombian army hired to protect the oil pipes.  this is just one of the<br>
more explicit forms of it, but if you consider a government to be just a<br>
business, then the army is constantly just a ppa.<br>
