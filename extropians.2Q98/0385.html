I really hate to defend the English actions in Ireland, which have in the<br>
past been much more oppressive even than those they used against my <br>
ancestors in Scotland...<br>

Only one problem... the Irish government have made clear on many occasions<br>
that they don't want the IRA and definitely don't want the Northern <br>
Protestants; AFAIR they even changed their constitution recently to remove<br>
any claim on Northern Ireland. You can't seriously suggest dumping millions <br>
of Protestants into one of the most staunchly Catholic countries on the <br>
planet?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The PEOPLE you refer to are descendants of those deliberately</i><br>

<i>&gt;invaders every bit as much as the soldiers.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, so an Irish Protestant who was born in Ireland, grew up in Ireland,<br>
lives in Ireland, and comes from a family that's been living in Ireland<br>
for centuries is an invader? I think you're letting emotion get in the<br>
way of reality; which is the main reason why nothing has been solved<br>
in Ireland despite decades of warfare.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unlike the soldiers who</i><br>
<i>&gt;do not belong there,</i><br>
<p>
In reality, of course, while the soldiers have on many occasions acted<br>
reprehensively against the Republicans -- and IMHO some should have been<br>
up in court on murder charges for it -- their main job is to keep the<br>
Republican extremists and Unionist extremists apart, not to act as an<br>
invading force.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;they would be free to remain, but under Irish,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not British law.</i><br>
<p>
But the vast majority of Northern Irish don't want that, and the Irish<br>
government don't want that, so how is it going to happen? Trust me, the<br>
majority of British people and government would be glad to get rid of <br>
Northern Ireland and give it to the South if they could do so.<br>
