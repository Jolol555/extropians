  Could anybody advise some cryonics visuals or their sources for TechnoCalyps?  <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; TechnoCalyps is a Belgian TV-documentary that is exploring the reality<br>
of transhuman science, its impact on society, and the basic philosophical<br>
issues around it. In that context, they are still looking for images of<br>
suspended animation, proving that cryonics, and the reviving of frozen<br>
people, is not just a pipe-dream, but has been prefigured in animal<br>
research.<br>
<p>
They have heard of rat and primate research, for example of a rat being<br>
frozen, knocked on a table, and then successfully revived, but have as yet<br>
been unable to identify a source, BioTime being unwilling to share the<br>
tapes due to current animal welfare sensibilities.<br>
<p>
Can anyone help to identify a realistic source for such images? The crew<br>
will be in the Bay Area from April 30 to May 8, and in LA from May 10 to<br>
16th. They can be reached a crew@technocalyps.com<br>
