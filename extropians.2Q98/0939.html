Erik, please either shut up or at least make some kind of meaningful points.<br>
"Poverty level" means absolutely nothing, because it's an entirely subjective<br>
term... 'poverty' in the US is utterly incomparable to real poverty in the<br>
third world and elsewhere.<br>
<p>
And how the hell do you intend to 'regulate' an economy without a big evil<br>
government? The free market is the natural state of an economy; only big<br>
government can convert it into the kind of mess we see in the modern world.<br>
<p>
Frankly, I'm really tired of reading all this crap; I will debate the merits<br>
of the free market on other lists (and often do), but I sure as hell don't<br>
want to come in to work in the morning and have to delete 50 or 60 of these<br>
messages on this list every day.<br>
<p>
