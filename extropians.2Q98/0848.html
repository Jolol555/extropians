<p>
<p>
   IAN: What? You think Religions are seeking truth?<br>
   I'd say that that pretty much defines what they <br>
   are NOT doing and what science IS doing. Almost<br>
   without except, religions consider their definition<br>
   of truth to be defined, like, case closed. On the <br>
   other hand, in science the supreme truth, which<br>
   might be the "Unified Field Theory," is yet to <br>
   be found, and admittedly so. So what is actively<br>
   being sought in science is absolute knowledge of<br>
   truth (that's why people are still researching).<br>
   The "religious seeker" may be looking for truth,<br>
   but virtually any given religion has "found it."<br>
<p>
   Religions have truths generally in spite of them-<br>
   selves. Because they had some wise observers at <br>
   their roots, or along the way. Yet in the broad<br>
   definition that Erik applies to ExI, we could <br>
   even define science as a religion, since it <br>
   has principles and de facto rituals. But a<br>
   scientific ritual of investigation seeks to <br>
   gain new information, whereas most religious<br>
   rituals seek to simply repeat old information.<br>
<p>
   There is a difference between science and religion,<br>
   but that difference is not that religion =&gt; truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Instead science seeks to develop theory, these theories are judged by</i><br>
<i>&gt;their applications in the real world.  For instance, it doesn't matter</i><br>
<i>&gt;if quantum mechanic's is true or false as long as I can build a</i><br>
<i>&gt;working quantum computer.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: That's the principle I see people here<br>
   applying to my holistic theory: "Ya, OK, so <br>
   it's true, but so what? Does it get a better<br>
   mouse trap, a faster car?" Utility over truth.<br>
<p>
   I think that principle, "utility over truth," <br>
   is actually pretty religious. Religions serve<br>
   a utilitarian purpose to those therein. It gets<br>
   them feeling better, it gives them stability,<br>
   it gives them fraternity, hope, and so forth.<br>
   Show them that the underlying claims of truth<br>
   their religion stands on are false and that <br>
   doesn't really matter to them, since truth<br>
   is NOT the real goal they are after. So I<br>
   see your definition of the goal of science<br>
   as more fitting to the goal of religion.<br>
<p>
   I think it falls apart totally in that I <br>
   believe that the degree to which science <br>
   yields material outcomes is the degree <br>
   to which science has discovered truths. <br>
   And future benefits from science will<br>
   come from future discoveries of truth.<br>
