Dear all,<br>
<p>
Here in the Netherlands they are starting with <br>
a national database of all the people in Holland, in<br>
which they record what you would like to be done<br>
with your organs should you die. We all have to fill<br>
in a form and express our wish. Up on our death the<br>
doctors will immediately contact this database and ask<br>
for the wish. <br>
<p>
Since "we" sign up for Cryonics it is not wise to express<br>
the wish, that we would like to donate our organs.<br>
Also on this form there is no room to put in writing what<br>
wish you may have (a missed opportunity IMHO).<br>
<p>
However, there is the option to give an other person the<br>
right to choose for you. So, I could appoint a member of<br>
Transcedo to make sure that they don't use my organs.<br>
<p>
The beauty of this is, that he/she will be contacted ASAP.<br>
<p>
Second: they will keep me "alive" until the decision is made,<br>
this could be very valuable I think.......<br>
<p>
Please share your opinion. Is it a good thing to use this <br>
option? or do we risk a lot of damage by the "waiting"<br>
period. Is anyone a doctor, and does he/she knows what<br>
the procedure is with donations.<br>
<p>
THANKS !! :)<br>
<p>
