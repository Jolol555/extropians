Unless somebody invents FTL travel, which I must consider unlikely based on<br>
current scientific knowledge, each economic system will be effectively limited<br>
to a single solar system.  You can't have an interstellar economic system any<br>
more than you can have an interstellar government.  So, the real concern is<br>
not over-running the resources of the universe, but rather over-running the<br>
resources of individual star systems.<br>
<p>
Obviously we're a long way from doing that.  However, it *could* happen.<br>
Eventually it *will* happen, unless some other factor comes into play.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;So if/when we actually do find impregnable resource limits, I'll hear your</i><br>
<i>&gt;point.  Until then, we've got a long way to go.</i><br>
<p>
No resource limit is "impregnable" if you assume there will be miracle<br>
technologies that can repeal the laws of physics.  I prefer not to make<br>
that assumption.<br>
<p>
Hm.  That reminds me of Groo the Wanderer....<br>
<p>
   Chakaal: "As long as the lizard-men are inside their citadel, they<br>
      are impregnable!"<br>
<p>
   Groo: "They cannot have children?"<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is CERTAINLY outside the field of economics.  :)  However, on a more</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophical point, what ELSE would we be motivated by?</i><br>
<p>
The pursuit of greatness, perhaps.  To me, this is one thing that separates<br>
people from animals.  As animal-rights activists are quick to point out,<br>
animals can suffer just like humans, and animals can also be happy.  But, they<br>
can't achieve greatness.<br>
<p>
The Pharaoh Khufu created the Great Pyramid at Giza.  Presumably it made him<br>
happy to create pyramids.  Now Khufu is long dead, and he is therefore no<br>
longer happy, but his pyramid is STILL GREAT.  He changed the world.<br>
<p>
That's why I am interested in Project Star Net.  It's the greatest thing that<br>
I can think of, so I would like to contribute in whatever way I can to making<br>
it happen.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you trying to tell me what life is going to be like post-singularity?</i><br>
<p>
Post-singularity?  I'm not familiar with that term.  The only singularity I<br>
know about is a black hole.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I sure won't.  I'm of the camp that believes that while some concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt;economics may exist post-singularity, we have no rational way of figuring</i><br>
<i>&gt;out what we'll want, need, or think past that point.</i><br>
<p>
I see no obstacle to making such predictions.  (Keeping in mind that I'm not<br>
sure exactly what you mean by "post-singularity".)  There will be a lot of<br>
chaos and upheaval in our near future, but that will all shake out eventually<br>
and reach a stable condition.  This is one of those odd cases where<br>
forecasting the distant future is much easier than forecasting the near<br>
future.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is this even remotely the case?  I don't know.  However, I think you must</i><br>
<i>&gt;agree with me that wherever that resource limit lies, it's nowhere close to</i><br>
<i>&gt;where we are.  So as far as we can tell, we're creating resources.</i><br>
<p>
That is true.  Did I mention my idea for renovating the MOON?  I wanted to<br>
strip off the whole top layer and convert it into utility fog.  Turn the whole<br>
thing into a virtual environment.  I'm sure the eco-freaks would turn blue if<br>
they heard such an idea.  But what a wonderful resources it would be!  You<br>
could create something similar to the Well World, with the virtual space<br>
partitioned off into "hexes" with each a different environment, each with<br>
something different to offer its visitors (or residents) -- and the whole<br>
thing permanently parked here next to the Earth for easy access.  How<br>
convenient!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Non-problem, yes.  However, as I think is self-evident, it is morally right</i><br>
<i>&gt;to create a new person if they will be happy, and if the happiness of</i><br>
<i>&gt;others does not decrease.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that is self-evident at all.  Anyhow, I like ELBOW ROOM.  I<br>
would be happy to live in a star system with a few million other people, or<br>
maybe even LESS.  But maybe I'm just weird because I live in a rural area of<br>
Texas where the population has been *shrinking* for years, and I still feel<br>
crowded sometimes.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;tsk tsk&gt;  Malthus was wrong, and later recanted his own theory.</i><br>
<p>
Malthus was wrong about details and timing, but his basic principle was rock<br>
solid, like the firmness of the earth.  Human beings are replicators and will<br>
eventually over-run any fixed resource.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;We are nowhere near any imaginable energy limit, and do not seem likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt;hit upon it very soon.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe energy won't be the problem.  Maybe it will be waste heat.  Maybe it<br>
will be the supply of raw matter.  Maybe it will be living space.  Whatever<br>
limit there may be, an exponentially growing population will eventually find<br>
it.<br>
<p>
So, anything that's not going to happen "very soon" is something we shouldn't<br>
concern ourselves with?  But "very soon" is a relative term.  Just a while<br>
back, somebody on this list referred to a span of several million years as an<br>
"eyeblink", if I recall right.<br>
