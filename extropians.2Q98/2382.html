Volume 2 of the Journal of Transhumanism <br>
(<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com">http://www.transhumanist.com</a>) is now released, featuring a paper by <br>
Robin Hanson on the singularity and the economics of explosive <br>
growth. If you feel competent, please consider submitting a note to <br>
the open peer commentary to seed the discussion.<br>
<p>
<p>
Is a singularity just around the corner? What it takes to get <br>
explosive economic growth<br>
<p>
ABSTRACT<br>
Economic growth is determined by the supply and demand of <br>
investment capital; technology determines the demand for capital, <br>
while human nature determines the supply. The supply curve has two <br>
distinct parts, giving the world economy two distinct modes. In the <br>
familiar slow growth mode, rates of return are limited by human <br>
discount rates. In the fast growth mode, investment is limited by the <br>
world's wealth. Historical trends suggest that we may transition to <br>
the fast mode in roughly another century and a half. Can some new <br>
technology switch us to the fast mode more quickly than this? <br>
Perhaps, but such a technology must greatly raise the rate of return <br>
for theworld's expected worst investment project. It must thus be <br>
very broadly applicable, improving almost all forms of capital and <br>
investment.  Furthermore, investment externalities must remain within <br>
certain limits.<br>
