Apparently it was purported to be a policy back in the 60's-70's to prevent average people from coming into<br>
contact with meteorites or other objects which might have contagious organisms on or in them that humanity<br>
might have no defense against. THis was when books like The Andromeda Strain was a best seller and<br>
astronauts were kept in 'isolation' environemnts when returning from space....<br>
<p>
However, I am aware that sections like that shown above that are publicly stated to be [reserved] are in<br>
fact in use and are merely classified at a high level. For example, its been reported that classified<br>
sections of the National Security Act of 1947 placed the nation in a secret state of martial law, in order<br>
to combat the communist menace (remember that this was at the time of the Rosenbergs, Klaus Fuchs, etc. so<br>
the paranoia was at an all time high at this point), and that there are a number of 'reserved' sections of<br>
the Code of Federal Regulations which were enacted by this Act and are still today classified. At this<br>
point, we start to reach X-files levels of paranoia ourselves, and are wont to end this digression....<br>
