From: Anton Sherwood (dasher@netcom.com):<br>
: If the government has no knowledge of aliens, then why does Title 14,<br>
: Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations, implemented on July<br>
: 16, 1969, make it illegal for U.S. citizens to have any contact with<br>
: extraterrestrials or their vehicles?<br>
<p>
This is one of those experiments where people post fiction and see how<br>
long it is believed, right?<br>
<p>
You can search the Code of Federal Regulations at <br>

<p>

reindex their database is:<br>

and the contents is:<br>
<p>
