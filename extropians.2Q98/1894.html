  IAN: Maybe it was such a spark that over 100 <br>
  witnesses saw shoot up, trailing white smoke to <br>
  take down the plane, at least 96 of whom saw it <br>
  originate on the surface. But I doubt that any <br>
  of the wires of a 747 at 13,700 ft would also <br>
  be located on the surface of the ocean, or <br>
  even if so, arch 13,700 ft to the plane.<br>
<p>
  Also, while the NTSB cannot say how a spark could <br>
  get into the CFT, there's no reason to believe that<br>
  even if one did that it would cause an explosion. <br>
  The fuel used in commercial jets is Jet A-1, which,<br>
  unlike gasoline, does not easily explode. You can <br>
  put out a cigarette in Jet A-1. It is not until <br>
  the fuel is 127 degrees that it becomes flammable. <br>
<p>
  The FBI/CIA Evergreen test claiming to prove <br>
  that the fuel in a test plane was flammable at<br>
  14,000 did so in a plane with a 17-degree hotter<br>
  ambient temperature than existed in TWA 800!<br>
<p>

<p>
  Furthermore, fuel explosions are weak explosions. <br>
  Fuel explosions are * combustions * NOT detonations. <br>
  A combustion is when the explosive reaction travels <br>
  through the explosive material at a subsonic rate. <br>
  A combustion in the center of the plane will not <br>
  rip the nose off of the plane (which was the <br>
  first thing that happened). I could list many<br>
  examples of physical damage that occurred to<br>
  the plane and the passengers that define <br>
  high-velocity forces far in excess of <br>
  any low-velocity vapor combustion.<br>
<p>
  The CFT theory is a crackpot theory that may be<br>
  "good enough" to fool some of the people some of <br>
  the time, but not all of the people all the time.<br>
