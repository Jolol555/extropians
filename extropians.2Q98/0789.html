John Clark:<br>

<i>&gt;Oh you horrible horrible man! My world view is based on Extropian thought,</i><br>
my<br>
<i>&gt;emotional life is hinged on it, but now you use your superior intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt;and knowledge to expose my belief system for the hollow shell that it is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You big bad intellectual bully you, don't you know how deeply your words</i><br>
hurt?<br>
<i>&gt;Extropians are delicate creatures, but you use cold logic to prove that all</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we thought was true and beautiful is really meaningless and ugly, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that my life is nothing but one big lie built on a foundation of sand. Oh</i><br>
<i>&gt;the shame of it all, life is no longer worth living. I'm going to go to bed</i><br>
<i>&gt;now and cry myself to sleep.</i><br>
<p>
You see, just that Extropy is a cult doesn't mean that it's as stupid as<br>
Christianity. Especially your postings on this list have often been<br>
enlightening to me and usually of high quality (although you have a<br>
psychical bug that often causes you to rant like this. Never mind, have the<br>
same bug). It's just that the _basics_ of your worldview are beliefs and<br>
wrong assumptions that do not correlate with reality. That's why I wrote<br>
"your fundamentals are built on sand". The building itself may be made of<br>
steel concrete, but it's still no safe place to live in.<br>
<p>
Maybe I will dissect the Extropian Principles some other day. For now, I<br>
just advise you not to be too one-sided. Revise the basics of your thinking<br>
often, for if they are wrong, all further work will be negatively biased.<br>
You probably guessed that I mainly refer to the idea of free markets. For a<br>
start, don't evaluate whether they are good or bad but whether they are<br>
pratically possible in today's political and economic power structures. You<br>
have agreed with me in the past that today's big industry supports<br>
government because they get in trouble without them. Do you really think you<br>
stand any chance against The Powers That Be [TM]?<br>
<p>
Of course I also refer to your idea of individual freedom, which has other<br>
problems. If people are uneducated, they will make the wrong decisions --<br>
you can either force people to do the right things, which is tried in<br>
current systems, or you can educate them better.  *Or* you just leave them<br>
do anything they want to do and watch the world go to hell. Guess which path<br>
I would take. And -- of course -- I refer to the idea of freedom itself,<br>
which is only possible in a physical sense. There is no freedom of mind, no<br>
free will or whatever you call it. Decisions are dependant on information.<br>
You can make the masses think what you want if you got the media.<br>
<p>
Then there's this strange desire for immortality, which I do not oppose but<br>
cannot understand. You get immortal through your deeds, not through your<br>
biological existence. If you live forever but achieve little or nothing,<br>
what's your immortality worth? Then there's Extropy itself, the idea of<br>
bringing order into the universe, colonizing space &amp; building up space<br>
industry. Most of these ideas are either derivated from the false free<br>
market meme or from old thinking (strive for room to live in, colonize other<br>
continents).<br>
<p>
That's the most common meme bugs in Extropian thinking. There are others,<br>
less common ones, like the gun advocacy and the cryo discussions. They are,<br>
however, not characteristics of Extropy. The beliefs above are, they are<br>
part of the Extropian ideology (even if not clearly expressed, they are<br>
commonly shared).<br>
<p>
But if you do not even allow criticism on the list, these points will never<br>
be discussed and revised for most Extropians. If you give me a tag to<br>
include in messages criticizing Extropian thinking, I'd be happy. This way,<br>
they could be easily filtered for those who just want to believe. Why do you<br>
think am I still here? Because I hate you all so deeply? Certainly not. But<br>
we'll have to fix a lot of basic stuff before we can start serious<br>
discussions on this list.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Erik Moeller<br>
<p>
PS: I wish you long days and peaceful nights -- may your sleep be better<br>
than after my last message.<br>
