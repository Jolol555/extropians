Uh, that would seem unlikely, give the wavelength of ultrasonic sound<br>

Inasmuch would this differ from you internal scene representation? You <br>
have textures, depthcueing and stereo to construct a 3d description.<br>
<p>
The interesting part of sonar vision is that you can tell materials<br>
with different sound propagation velocities apart, e.g. a plastic and<br>
a steel ball. Also, you could theoretically share a mental image,<br>
though there is no evidence that the cetaceans really do that.<br>

P.S. Is the extropy listserv malfunctioning, or is this just me?<br>
