<p>
Too true, and thus I misspake.  I maintain that your costs are covered by<br>
your increase in revenues.  (The area inside the trapezoid.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe the DRAM problem arose because someone forecast a much too rosy</i><br>

<p>
Maybe.  This happens sometimes.  I don't see how this applies, however,<br>
unless you're trying to intimate that the increases in demand which I am<br>
referring to are "too rosy."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Therein lies the rub - who can tell if the costs will be less than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;revenuse. It's always a gamble. Sometimes you lose. C'est la vie..</i><br>
<p>
Indeed...  This IS one of those facts about life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;When there's lots of competitors, however, you can't set your price that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;way.  The market sets your prices in perfect competition, because if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;raise your prices at that quantity then nobody would buy from you;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;meanwhile if you lower your price at that quantity you'll take a loss.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Thus, your price is the same price as the entire market, and thus your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;marginal revenue is given by the simple demand curve.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I begin to see where some of our disagreement may lie. I am talking about</i><br>
<i>&gt;the real world, not theory.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not suggesting that the real world acts like perfect competition.<br>
However, the sales of copies of something is about as close as you get to<br>
it.  Entry into the market is negligible.  A copy from one firm is<br>
perfectly substitutable with another firm.  It is unlikely that one firm<br>
would be able to have any control over prices in a market like this.<br>
<p>
So to this extent, while the market for copies may not be PERFECT<br>
competition, it's damned close.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Fully satified, in my mind, is there is no one left who wants the product at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the moment, all have been served. Until this happens, there is still demand.</i><br>
<p>
You can't do that, and don't want to.  I might want an ultrasound sensor,<br>
too, if it only cost me $1.  I would presume you aren't catering to my<br>
price range, however, so you have to stop satisfying somewhere and choose a<br>
price.  And if you're a monopolist, that price will be higher than if you<br>
were in competition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the absence of any controls, how do you prevent a monopoly, given</i><br>
<i>&gt;somebody with the will to do it and no scruples?? A free market should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;free of government handouts and special favors, but should also be free of</i><br>
<i>&gt;coercion and use of force..</i><br>
<p>
Competition.  If you're trying to jack up the prices in a nasty way, and<br>
I'm offering an equivalent good at the lower price, you'll fail; the<br>
consumers will all (freely) buy from me.<br>
<p>
Indeed, many economists believe that it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to create a<br>
(non-natural) monopoly without government support.  Once the monopoly tries<br>
to jack up the prices, it creates a window between the actual marginal cost<br>
of the product and the market price, a window which competitors can make a<br>
profit filling.  So if you're really looking at someone to blame, look to<br>
the government, which has a history of corrupt corporate welfare.  It's<br>
"good for American businesses."  Heard that one before?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Agreed. That I need to be 'competitive. I still don't agree that I should</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to allow others to take my devlopment as is without compensating me.</i><br>
<p>
Returning to my original point, when you create something without monopoly,<br>
it's a good with positive externalities.  Your profits increase (given by<br>
your trapezoid minus the cost of invention) and all other firms in the<br>
industry gain as well (each of their individual trapezoids).  But when you<br>
create a monopoly, you deliberately cut off those externalities, and<br>
instead create an economic BAD:  higher prices at a lower quantity.<br>
<p>
I put forward that the cure, in this case, is worse than the "disease,"<br>
loathe though I am to call positive externalities a disease.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Look at it this way. I make ten widgets and put them on the market. I get</i><br>
<i>&gt;people offering to buy them. Someone comes along and steals five, exerting</i><br>
<i>&gt;some effort to convey them to his plant. I should allow him to keep and sell</i><br>
<i>&gt;them, because he took the effort to transport the product? The same thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;holds if I produce an idea, convert it to workable plans, and someone takes</i><br>
<i>&gt;the plans and builds my gadget. I have been the victim of a theft either</i><br>
<i>&gt;way. Ideas are the property of the thinker, until that person gives the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rights away.</i><br>
<p>
This isn't comparable AT ALL.  When someone takes five of your widgets, you<br>
can't sell them.  You reap no trapezoid.  When someone makes five widgets<br>
just like yours however, you can sell them, all of them, in a free and<br>
competitive market, and you ALL get a trapezoid.<br>
<p>
You can't compare information to widgets; the transmission of information<br>
is a SERVICE, not the sales of goods.  When I give you a backrub, I do you<br>
a service.  I have not made a "backrub unit" and sold it to you.  I have<br>
scratched your back, and you have paid me for it.<br>
<p>
Rather than thinking of services like widgets, try thinking of them like<br>
fire, a far more apt simile.  If you have fire, and I stick wood in your<br>
fire and "take" your fire, is your fire darker?  What have you lost,<br>
precisely?  The reason this is so tricky is because the distribution of<br>
fire is a service, not a widget.  If I WERE to sell you fire, it would not<br>
be because I have made a fire unit and I am selling you one.  If I were to<br>
sell you fire, I would be doing you the SERVICE of igniting your wood.  And<br>
BECAUSE services aren't like widgets, I can reasonably expect that someone<br>
else will be able to emulate my service; in this case, probably the person<br>
I sold it to.<br>
<p>
The difference between a service and the sale of goods is not semantic;<br>
neither is the sale of goods a service.  They are distinct non-colliding<br>
entities (unless someone has an example to the contrary; this isn't one)<br>
which represent very different transactions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All we need is someone who will put up the money to the inventor for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rights to the product, knowing that as soon as he produces the thing, twenty</i><br>
<i>&gt;knockoff plants will be making the identical thing, and at less cost, since</i><br>
<i>&gt;this poor fellow had to pay the inventor. The theft is now one person</i><br>
<i>&gt;removed from the inventor, and he does not suffer directly. Since there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;no property rights in an idea, the first plant owner can't recover from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;copyists..</i><br>
<p>
The investor does not buy the RIGHTS from the inventor; he pays for the<br>
service of being told the information.  And reasonably, if that investor<br>
wants to sell that service to others, he must expect that others will be<br>
able to emulate his service.<br>
