<i>&gt;&gt;   be covered by the MGS, and the pyramids are </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   out of the strips, or the plan altogether:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Odd, because that's an MGS image (see the original at</i><br>
<a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD2/cydonia2m_tjp_bot.gif">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD2/cydonia2m_tjp_bot.gif</a>) and Hoagland,<br>
<i>&gt;'Mr Face' himself, claims it's a pyramid. Quite clearly it's not, and only</i><br>
<i>&gt;looks a little like one because of the human's natural tendency to 'draw</i><br>
<i>&gt;lines' between dots.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I don't know why Hoagland is showing what <br>
  is not the pyramid and implying that it is the <br>
  pyramid. Clearly, one need not "connect the <br>
  dots" to see the pyramids that are pyramids.<br>
<p>
  The URL you point to is also NOT the pyramids<br>
  in question. If I say "House X looks old," and<br>
  you counter by saying, "Your wrong, house Y <br>
  looks new," what's going on here? The pyramids<br>
  in question were clearly visible on the sites<br>
  I pointed to, including NASA (which you can trust<br>
  since it's a Govt page). Again, MGS has not imaged <br>
  the pyramids. The NASA pages tell us just that.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Here you will see the planned second sweep </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   and the actual sweep. It was going to get </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   one of the pyramids, but D'oh! missed: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It was probably part of THE CONSPIRACY that FAKED the Mars Face photos...</i><br>
<i>&gt;but now we're onto them they don't DARE fake any more so they had to </i><br>
<i>&gt;miss it. The Face-Freaks are TOO SMART for NASA.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Your missing the actual evidence again.<br>
   Joking about conspiracy does not explain what<br>
   geological forces create 5-sided pyramids. I'm<br>
   just as willing to believe natural as not, but <br>
   making jokes and throwing "crap" isn't useful,<br>
   at least to some trying to figure this out.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   In these Viking images you can see both pyramids.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Notice the largest one on the lower right side.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   While the Viking images may be fuzzier than the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   MGS images, the hard lines are hard lines.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Uh-huh, but most of the 'lines' don't really exist; as far as I can see</i><br>
<i>&gt;they're just optical illusions like Hoagland's pyramid image. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: What your saying is just false. I don't<br>
   know why Hoagland is showing what is not the <br>
   pyramids, claiming it is, but images of the <br>
   actual physical objects in question have been <br>
   made available to you, yet you seem to prefer <br>
   Hoagland's error over the actual evidence.<br>
<p>
   There are hard lines that are not an illusion<br>
   in both the Viking and around the base of the <br>
   "face" in the MGS images, and those lines also<br>
   showed up perfectly in the Viking images.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The remainder</i><br>
<i>&gt;are no more unusual than mountains on Earth, and as for the 'perfect shadows'</i><br>
<i>&gt;you talk about, you should really try looking at the shadow of a mountain</i><br>
<i>&gt;sometime. I've watched sunrise from the top of Mt Fuji, and its shadow is</i><br>
<i>&gt;just as 'perfect' a triangle as any of those 'pyramids'.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: You should try to observe the actual <br>
   physical evidence and not what is not the <br>
   physical evidence in question, maybe then<br>
   you can actually start to analyze the facts.<br>
   In short, you don't even know what your<br>
   rejecting out of hand!!<br>
<p>
   It may all be natural, but I hate to see <br>
   even the right conclusion drawn for the <br>
   wrong reasons, and your reasons are wrong.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; And the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   MGS images of the face reveal perfectly straight,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   parallel running lines and perfectly ovoid curves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Look, it's not a face, it's a lumpy-bumpy rock thing, OK; it looks nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;like a face to anyone </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: To say that it's similarity to a face <br>
   = 0% is just flat-out false. It has a striking<br>
   resemblance to a face even in the MGS images.<br>
   And then all around the base of the "face" <br>
   are perfectly straight lines and formations,<br>
   perfect ovoid lines and a sharp right angle.<br>
<p>
   Would a perfectly (or nearly so) carved face<br>
   not erode over time? Ancient human structures<br>
   erode. Why should we not ask these questions?<br>
   The reaction to the "face" on the ExI list<br>
   seems to be anti-inquiry, anti-questioning,<br>
   just throw "crap" at this issue. Bizarre.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;but those who have too much invested in the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;face hysteria to change their minds. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I cuts both ways, a lot of people have<br>
   invested in throwing "crap" at the face and<br>
   are not about to allow that to change. For <br>
   anyone to look at the face and write it off<br>
   as "crap" is entirely reactionary and anti-<br>
   thetical to truth inquiry. There are forms<br>
   in and around the "face" that are highly <br>
   anomalies/unusual at the very least.<br>
<p>
   Should those not be explained? Does science<br>
   say, "We need to explain everything, except <br>
   those pyramids and sharp liner formations <br>
   on Mars, they are crap."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I, for one, have seen no 'perfectly</i><br>
<i>&gt;straight, parallel running lines' or 'perfect ovoid curves',</i><br>
<p>
   IAN: Glasses might help.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Frankly, this is probably my last comment on this pointless thread, except</i><br>
<i>&gt;to point out what I find most bizarre. The original justification for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;face hysteria was that there was a rock which supposedly looked like a</i><br>
<i>&gt;face. Now that there's a high-resolution photo which shows it looks nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;like a face, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: It does not "Look nothing like a face."<br>
   It has strong face resemblance, but that's <br>
   not all (in fact by it self, I'd probably<br>
   agree it's natural), what is most interesting<br>
   are the sharp parallel running lines and forms<br>
   and perfect ovoid curves around the "face" base.<br>
<p>
   If you can't see them, I find that most bizarre.<br>
<p>
