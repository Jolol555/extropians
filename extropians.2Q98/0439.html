<i>&gt; From:          anduril@cix.compulink.co.uk (Tony Hollick)</i><br>
<i>&gt;    [ FX: "SHOUT MODE ON:" ]</i><br>
<p>
Stop shouting! :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       There is no 'Absolute Foundation' for property rights, and to </i><br>
<i>&gt;       propose to base an entire society on the illusion that there is, is </i><br>
<i>&gt;       the sort of crass folly only clever people are capable of.</i><br>
<p>
Property rights, to everything except raw natural resources <br>
(inc. land) land, can be directly derived from a right of <br>
self-ownership.  So can freedom of speech, assembly, religion, etc.  <br>
<p>
So failure to support property rights is qualified failure to support <br>
the right of self-ownership, which is a qualified endorsement of <br>
slavery.<br>
<p>
Property rights to raw natural resources (inc. land) can be <br>
developed from the pragmatic need to enforce property rights in other <br>
things; from concern about the environment; from considerations of <br>
efficiency.  In fact we observe worldwide that natural resources <br>
which are unowned (not the property of any particular person) in <br>
their natural state are abused, overexploited, and threatened, <br>
except in those cases where by government decree they are <br>
underutilized, and then usually neglected; those which are owned and <br>
thoroughly under the control of the owner, are comparatively *much* <br>
better cared for.<br>
