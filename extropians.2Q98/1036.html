<i>&gt; &gt;  Indeed, atheism is (often) more than just saying "it's extremely</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;  exists". It's about understanding that, certainly for a transhumanist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  the existence of god is _not_ "neutral", but very, VERY bad. All our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  efforts would be futile. After all, don't we want to become gods</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  ourselves? No such luck if the job has already been taken....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Structuring your worldview solely to satisfy your ideology strikes me as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous project.  Gods may or may not exist at present.  Most understandings</i><br>
<i>&gt; of theology make the question utterly unresolvable in a theoretic sense (thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; encouraging principled agnostism).   Practically speaking, of course, sensible</i><br>
<i>&gt; people find it useful to assume that gods do *not* exist, and to act like</i><br>
<i>&gt; atheists in a day-to-day sense.  But none of that justifies embracing</i><br>
<i>&gt; *theoretical* atheism from fear of the anomie that could follow facing</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible truths.  Better, I think, to cut the bluff and learn to live with</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited facts.</i><br>
<p>
However using Occams razor, if no other alien races in the universe have acheived<br>
godhood status through a singularity cultural evolution already, then it is also<br>
highly unlikey that we could acheive such status.  if it hasn't been done already<br>
by some other race, its not likely we will be able to do it in the future....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  And I shall continue as a quite vocal atheist until someone can present</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  sufficient evidence of god's existence and/or that this would not be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  disaster for humanity and transhumanists in particular.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I take it that an atheist in fact asserts that gods do not and cannot exist--a</i><br>
<i>&gt; claim that cries out for positive proof.  But, again, most understandings of</i><br>
<i>&gt; theology deny that scientific methods will suffice to resolve the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; god's existence.  Scientists typically agree that they have little to add to</i><br>
<i>&gt; theological disputes.  Defending atheism thus take more than mere rejection of</i><br>
<i>&gt; theism; it calls for the sort of proof that, ex hypothesis, cannot obtain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I used to think myself an atheist--until I decided that even denying the</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence of gods gives too much credit to theology.  I now cheerfully admit</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorance about whether gods exist . . . though that does not prevent me from</i><br>
<i>&gt; theorizing about what I might make possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I won't claim that they cannot exist, but I find it highly unlikely that if<br>
becoming godlike is a possibility in this universe that the universe is not<br>
teeming with such beings evolved from other alien species. That we are not being<br>
harassed and dominated by at least one of these beings right now indicates to me<br>
that either a) they actually cooperate (another highly unlikely possibility) and<br>
have embargoed our planet, or b) they do not exist in this universe. If becoming a<br>
god requires one to go to another universe, then of course, it is as good as not<br>
being one at all, as far as we are concerned...<br>
