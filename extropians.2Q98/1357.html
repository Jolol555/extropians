The main problem for me is not such interpretation, just because I suppose<br>
they did not even know Everest... And the greater mountain for them was<br>
possibly Sinai...They were, in general, an ignorant people, with almost no<br>
great commerce or knowledge of the rest of the world... They were weak, lots<br>
of times were taken as slaves... Just after, at the time of Solomon or<br>
David, they got a little more importance... Their main difference  was the<br>
religiousty with a monotheist image of the supposed god was of a Good<br>
Father... This made them different from Greek ( = Roman ) Theology... And,<br>
talking about good things and look: ressurrection... they "made the minds"<br>
of other people... ( Note that Christians were nothing more than<br>
revolutionary ( in the philosophical sense... ) Neo-Jews, for that time... )  <br>

<i>&gt;That's not the worst of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It rained so much as to cover the mountain (and don't forget that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;fountains of the earth opened up to help out).  That would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;Everest, which according to my almanac (I found the damn thing </i><br>
<i>&gt;again) is 29,028 feet above sea level.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It did this in only 40 days and 40 nights = 960 hours.  The water </i><br>
<i>&gt;level rose at an average of 363 inches per hour.  Even if only 10% of </i><br>
<i>&gt;that is rain (the rest being from the fountains of the earth), that's </i><br>
<i>&gt;a yard of rain an hour.  A heavy Midwestern rainstorm delivers maybe </i><br>
<i>&gt;four inches an hour.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With a yard of rain an hour, Noah didn't need an ark.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He needed a submarine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;an ark.</i><br>
