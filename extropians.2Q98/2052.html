I'd put it differently: it acknowledges that any non-trivial system of <br>
thought requires certain founding assumptions. Using these founding <br>
assumptions is not an irrational procedure, unless you wish to declare <br>
all systems of thought irrational.<br>
<p>
In the case of transhumanists, the founding assumptions, or basic values, <br>
are such that life extension is a rational goal. Other systems of thought <br>
do not necessarily imply that.<br>

<p>
How does it fail to meet this criteria?<br>
