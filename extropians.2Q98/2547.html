<i>&gt; This is really easy to understand, I can summarize in four words...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;             SCIENCE, TRUTH</i><br>
<i>&gt;             RELIGION, MEANING.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Science is our greatest method for finding truth, but religion</i><br>
<i>&gt; generates meaning.</i><br>
<p>
	This isn't the way I see it at all.  Science is a rational<br>
method of finding truth, meaning, and anything else of value.<br>
Religion is simply something that comes into play when there isn't yet<br>
enough scientific or rational information or data to convince everyone<br>
such that they all have the same view.  When everyone disagrees,<br>
because of lack of reliable scientific evidence, we fall back on<br>
religion.  When there is finally enough reliable or rational evidence<br>
to convince everyone, then it becomes science.  And this includes the<br>
realm of "meaning".  I find infinitely more good and hopeful "meaning"<br>
in science than in any nebulous, unreproducible, ununderstandable,<br>
contradictory religion I know of.  For example, the "meaning of life"<br>
is very different and contradictory in all of the religions of the<br>
world.  That is why it is religion, because no one can agree on which<br>
religious views are mistaken and which are closer to reality.  Only<br>
rational means such as science can reliably show us which "meanings of<br>
life" are mistaken or misguided and which are true, good, hopeful and<br>
worth having faith in and striving for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm telling you that Science will lead you to the top of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mountain but when you get there you'll have no idea what your</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking at unless you embrace your soul and take a little religion</i><br>
<i>&gt; along too.</i><br>
<p>
	As long as there is "religion", or people are disagreeing<br>
about what is right and what is wrong, we will not yet be "at the top<br>
of the mountain" or know for sure any true meanin.  Only when all<br>
religion is eliminated and everything has become science,<br>
i.e. everyone can finally agree and reliably understand why, will we<br>
have finally discovered all meaning and truth.<br>
