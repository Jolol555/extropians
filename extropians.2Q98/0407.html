As people's lifespans slowly but surely start to increase, the frequency<br>
of death from "unnatural causes" will also increase. Eventually, the<br>
chance of dying in a car accident or plane crash will become quite<br>
significant. Approximately one in 2 million flights go down. That means<br>
that if you make only 100 flights in your life, the chance is one in<br>
20,000 that one of the planes will go down - that's way "better" than<br>
the lottery. I saw a rather horrifying TV program recently called "Why<br>
planes go down". Human error is by far the major reason. Anyway, there<br>
was one crash in which one of the engines blew out, and the pilots had<br>
to land the plane as best they could. Even though they had 1/2 hour to<br>
get the plane down, something like 150 people died. A rather obvious<br>
question is "why do airlines not make parachutes available to<br>
passengers." Admitedly, there are some incidents where you have _no_<br>
time to save anybody, but sometimes there _is_ time to bail out. It may<br>
seem like a naive question, but I would appreciate people's opinions.<br>
