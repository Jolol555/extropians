Fair?  According to whom?  Why don't we let the <br>
free market decide what is fair, eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is about as logical as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;manufacturer only getting paid for some of the product he makes, i.e.</i><br>
not somthing<br>
<i>&gt;which should be legislated or forced on someone. Product for which a</i><br>
manufacturer<br>
<i>&gt;is not paid, and which he does not willingly donate to charity or give</i><br>
away is<br>
<i>&gt;STOLEN. GET IT?</i><br>
<p>
The problem with "stealing" information is that it is<br>
sooo difficult to show the missing information, since<br>
it isn't.  As long as you still have something, I haven't<br>
stolen it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, you are still ignoring my question as to why I or anyone should</i><br>
invent<br>
<i>&gt;something to benefit others without our say so as to who can benefit</i><br>
freely from it<br>
<i>&gt;and who pays. Anything less is theft.</i><br>
<p>
After you sell any other product, you don't insist that you<br>
continue to own it and can decide who gets it next, so <br>
why with information?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;All you are doing is akin to an attempt to legislate PI to equal 3. Get</i><br>
off your<br>
<i>&gt;subjectivist, post modern butt and pay for what you use. No free</i><br>
lunches.<br>
<p>
Not even for monopolists, right?  I could go with that...<br>
