Dear fellow Transhumans,<br>
<p>
Below some short impressions from various participants of the first<br>
European Transhumanist Gathering, more later. Information about Transvision<br>
'98 can be found on the Transcedo website <a href="http://www.transcedo.org">http://www.transcedo.org</a>.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Arjen Kamphuis<br>

Waldemar Ingdahl, Aleph Sweden:<br>
Incredible, there are quite a few transhumanists in Europe, and now that we<br>
have met we can start to plan about some serious stuff. Let us organize a<br>
European Meeting in 1999 too.<br>
<p>
Ake Brannstrom, Aleph, Sweden:<br>
It's fun, and I think that Amsterdam is an excellent city to host<br>
TransVision. I hope to see you there next year!<br>
<p>
Gernot Faulseit, Germany:<br>
Pretty interesting, nice city, nice people - just a perfect atmosphere to<br>
discuss Transhuman goals. To the rest of the German Transhumanists: We need<br>
our own association!!<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg, Aleph, Sweden:<br>
This is the start of something great.<br>
<p>
Felix Ungman, Aleph, ExI, World<br>
TransVisionaries of the world are uniting.<br>
<p>
Erik Moeller, Germany:<br>
Sweet location. It is certainly interesting to meet the people you have<br>
only talked to via email before. Anyone who did not come missed something,<br>
although it is hard to describe what.<br>
<p>
Remi Sussan, France:<br>
Really great event!<br>
<p>
Klaus Mathwig, Germany:<br>
Great event, we should start a german transhumanist organization.<br>
<p>
Sven Visser, Transcedo, ExI, the Netherlands:<br>
Having a great time whitnessing the beginning of great things to come.<br>
<p>
Holger Wagner:<br>
It's nice to see some of the bodies, mimics and gestures that belong to the<br>
ASCII-communication on the mailing-lists. We should do this somewhat more<br>
often until we have life-like Avatars ;-)<br>
<p>
Henrik Alpsten:<br>
Killroy wasn't here. But all the other nice guys in european Transhumansm<br>
are. Nice seeing the faces, some realtime presentations and having fun at<br>
the same time.<br>
<p>
Henri Kluytmans:<br>
I think part of the future of transhumanism is being shaped here. I'm<br>
thrilled to be here.<br>
I hope this is only the first of a yearly event.<br>
<p>
Berrie Staring:<br>
I really hope we can have even more people on TransVision '99. If we keep<br>
this "meme" going,	<br>
I think we can atract a lot more "new" Transhumanists. At least all the<br>
organisation we have	<br>
now are very much willing to cooperate and build a solid Transhuman-network.<br>
<p>
