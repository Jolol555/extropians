<i>&gt; Without the motive to do so, no entity needs to develop imagination. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Without imagination and volition, we'll never have true AI. That is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; is at the heart of the kind of intelligence we posess, and it cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardwired into a system, it must evolve through complex feedback from an</i><br>
<i>&gt; external environment.</i><br>
<p>
While I agree that we want volition for AI to become useful and<br>
interesting, I'm not sure it must be evolved. A sufficiently clever<br>
programmer might be able to write an AI program from scratch, although<br>
it might turn out that this is so tricky and inconvenient that<br>
everybody in their right minds will evolve AI and then tweak it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In fact, I expect it will be impossible to create a virtual world of</i><br>
<i>&gt; sufficient complexity to allow an AI 'baby' to achieve conceptual</i><br>
<i>&gt; awareness at all. Certainly far more complex than to create the AI 'baby'</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself. One would probably have to wire up the baby with enough sensory</i><br>
<i>&gt; organs to allow it to accumulate a rich enough sensory and perceptual</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience, with plenty of feedback mechanisms, and let it free in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; real world if one expected it to get anywhere in its cognitive growth. </i><br>
<p>
I think you make the mistake of thinking that we need to put all the<br>
complexity in by hand, which would likely be infeasible. But you could<br>
set up a basic set of world rules that encourage emergence, and then<br>
let the world develop (e.g. let virtual plants go through a run of<br>
simulated evolution, generating a synthetic ecology with fairly<br>
complex structures no human has had the need to program).<br>
<p>
Second, I don't see why you need to create a very complex virtual<br>
world. It might turn out that "rather complex" worlds will do just as<br>
well for creating basic AI. One might even have a succession of worlds<br>
of increasing size and complexity, where the AI grows up until it<br>
emerges in the real world.<br>
