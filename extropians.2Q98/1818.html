<i>&gt; Information is not a product, nor can it be treated as same.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; provision of information is a service, not a sale of consumable goods.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Your position is like saying that if I light a fire, and then sell you</i><br>
<i>&gt; some, and then you give/sell fire to your friends, you've stolen my fire.</i><br>
<p>
Information can certainly be treated as any other product. Since information cannot exist<br>
in nothingness, it needs to be represented in an arrangement of printed letters, or<br>
electrons, or sound waves, then it certainly has material existence and is therefore a<br>
product.<br>
<p>
A service is work, a kinetic, not a static state. Information is static like any other<br>
product. Transmitting information is doing work as it is a kinetic action, expending<br>
energy to do work, so the act of transmission is a service, and the act of agreeing to<br>
lend someone the use of my information for specific purposes on the condition that you do<br>
not reproduce my information to sell to others is also a service. The information which<br>
is lent is still a product.<br>
<p>
Moreover, service, or work, is the ultimate property right, unless you beleive in<br>
slavery. Only a slave does not have sole right to his or her own labor. An individual<br>
cannot have his or her work stolen from them. Intellectual property rights protect the<br>
product of that work, whether it is a statue, a song, a building, a machine, or anything<br>
else which is the result of man applying his or her intelligence to add value to<br>
something.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Similarly, your argument that intellectual property is stolen when copied</i><br>
<i>&gt; is valid but unsound; as you should already realize, I am opposed to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; premise that the right of other people to make copies of a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt; information could be lawfully owned.  Also, with respect to coercion, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; there were no intellectual prpoerty rights, then an inventor who knew this</i><br>
<i>&gt; and created a product anyway must necessarily be aware of the fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt; his transaction has positive externalities.  If the inventor created</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway, then the action is voluntary; the inventor accepts the fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people would benefit from his/her work.  This is simply stating the</i><br>
<i>&gt; trivial fact that if there were no property, there would be no "theft," in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the technical sense.  This is not a valid reason to eliminate property,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however.  Indeed, I maintain that we should enforce property rights in</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a way as to maximize economic efficiency.  For example, take a look</i><br>
<i>&gt; at:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter">http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; 43.html</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Which is chapter 43 of David Friednman's _Machinery of Freedom_, arguing</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the enforcement of only economically efficient property rights.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; intend to argue that intellectual property rights are NOT economically</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficent, and for that reason should not be enforced as law.</i><br>
<p>
I understand your logic, and beleive that you are wrong in your economic evaluation.<br>
Without a protect of an inventors intellectual property rights, there will not be the<br>
same level of invention as there is when there are such protections. The human race is<br>
desperately dependent on advancing technology from invention that is stimulated by<br>
intellectual property rights incentives, only because we are stuck on one planet with an<br>
ever increasing population. Every increase demands greater efficiency of resource<br>
utilization, something which can only happen with high levels of invention. You have<br>
ignored the incentive effect that such protections have on technological development.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As Friedman notes, the Coase theorem states that if transaction costs are</i><br>
<i>&gt; zero, externalities will be handled efficiently; that is, in this case, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; transaction costs were zero, the inventor could simply say "OK, world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've got my idea.  I'll tell everyone who wants to make a product with it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; all at once, if you all pay me your fair share in doing so."  Clearly this</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot happen due to the fact that transaction costs are high; trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; arrange such a bargain would be particularly difficult, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; considering that you would have to provide provisions to correct for those</i><br>
<i>&gt; who would hold out on the deal, cheat, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, which is why your concept cannot work and maintain a decent level of<br>
technological advancement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In reality, one of two things might happen: either we might enforce</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property, and as a result pay the high cost of trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce these laws (especially high over the Internet, where copying is</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy, anonymity cheap and encryption ubiquitious) as well as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; deadweight loss resulting from monopoly, or we should suffer</i><br>
<i>&gt; inefficiencies as inventors are not paid quite as much as they are worth</i><br>
<i>&gt; to society, resulting in a naturally lower price for invention, and thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; some deadweight loss as inventors produce fewer inventions than they</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise would.</i><br>
<p>
There are many ways to doctor information to ensure that it can be identified as a copy.<br>
For example, in my work, I deal with mail list brokers. We do mailstream processing for<br>
their customers. The broker will send us a tape or disk with file(s) that the customer<br>
rents from the broker for a single or more use. The customer then does his or her mail<br>
campaign with the rented list. The doctoring comes in in that the list is seeded with<br>
dummy name records which are set up by the broker. The customer does not know what names<br>
are seed names and what are real names, so they send their mail campaign to all of the<br>
names. The seed names receive the capaign materials (magazines, junk mail, free samples,<br>
what have you) and log it. If the customer is larcenous, they will try to use the rented<br>
list more than once, and wind up sending materials to the address the other times,<br>
including to the seed addresses. THis way, the broker knows that the customer is breaking<br>
the list rental agreement and can charge the customer for additional use of the list.<br>
<p>
Intellectual property enforcement  costs are extremely low, because it is very easy for<br>
the public to know when a product is a knock off or not. Granted they have gone up in<br>
recent years, but only because we have opened our economy wide to the Chinese, who have<br>
no respect for intellectual property, nor any other type of property or individuality, it<br>
seems. Rather than looking at pirating as a positive externality, look at the cost of<br>
enforcement as an externality created by pirates that everyone has to pay. If trade with<br>
pirate economies were cut off, our cost of intellectual property enforcement would go<br>
down again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, if we accept an economic analysis of law, then the question we should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be asking ourselves is: what form of intellectual property rights, if any,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is economically efficient?  I say that enforcing intellectual property</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights is more expensive than it is worth; while both result in deadweight</i><br>
<i>&gt; losses, if we presume that the supply curve for COPIES of the information</i><br>
<i>&gt; (or products produced using the idea) would be fairly elastic, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable presumption considering the ease of copying these days, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; halving of marginal revenues for monopolies would result in drastic</i><br>
<i>&gt; reductions in quantity, by up to 50% as the supply curve approaches total</i><br>
<i>&gt; elasticity.  Chances are something closer to 40% of the market is lost</i><br>
<i>&gt; thanks to monopolization.  And this doesn't yet consider the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement.</i><br>
<p>
You have to date, only guessed. Since the current situation is one where intellectual<br>
property is respected and enforced, I think that the onus is on YOU to prove your point<br>
with real numbers. Until you do, all we can think of your ideas is that they are quaint<br>
fantasy with no basis in fact.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, without intellectual property, these enforcement costs</i><br>
<i>&gt; would vanish; the only deadweight loss would be that from undervalued</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention.  While it is difficult to estimate precisely HOW undervalued</i><br>
<i>&gt; the price would be, as it would depend on the percentage of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; marketplace with which inventors would be able to sign a contract, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not immediately apparent that the inventor faces either a high or a low</i><br>
<i>&gt; elasticity in supply of ideas; I'd guess that it is probably not so</i><br>
<i>&gt; inelastic as the supply of copies is elastic.</i><br>
<p>
I think that history shows that lack of intellectual property enforcement causes<br>
invention to be severely undervalued. Looking at how national borders create natural<br>
limitations on intellectual property rights, and how making such rights enforceable<br>
across borders via tools such as GATT it seems rather clear that prior to enforced<br>
intellectual property rights, invention was severly undervalued, and the rates of<br>
productivity growth suffered as a result. Today's startling increases in  productivity<br>
just a few years after GATT are proof that expanding the incentive to invent expands the<br>
rate of invention and therefore the rate of productive growth<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if I am not precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt; right on this point, however, intellectual property is still not worth</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing if the deadweight loss due to undervaluing invention MINUS the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost of enforcing intellectual property (a non-trivial value) is less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the deadweight loss due to monopolization.  That is, even if the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; undervaluing inventions were greater than the cots of monoplization, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; still wouldn't necessarily be efficent to enforce intellectual property</i><br>
<i>&gt; because you would have to add on the cost of actually ENFORCING the law.</i><br>
<p>
Considering that you have refused to respond to my refutation of your assertion that an<br>
invention is a monopoly, your argument does not stand. Any engineer will tell you that<br>
there are always many many ways to solve a problem. Only problems are unique. Invention<br>
is not a monopoly market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In this case, I don't think it's possible to make a reasonable case that</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing intellectual property rights eliminates more economic deadweight</i><br>
<i>&gt; loss than it costs, especially considering that it very likely ADDS to</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic inefficiency rather than reduces it, even if the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement were free.  I am anxious to see how or if you can show me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be wrong.</i><br>
<p>
I don't need to. The present economy is my own proof. YOU need to come up with proof that<br>
economic growth would be higher without such protections. That the US has one of the<br>
highest levels of intellectual property protections, along with among the top 3 or 4 per<br>
capital incomes/standards of living, and among the highest economic and productivity<br>
growth rates for a nation at its state of development (a third world with a 50% growth<br>
rate doesn't mean anything if they are starting from nothing.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, you are still ignoring my question as to why I or anyone should invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; something to benefit others without our say so as to who can benefit freely from it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and who pays. Anything less is theft.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Theft does not exist where property rights do not exist.</i><br>
<p>
No, theft is when someone benefits from someone else without that persons permission or<br>
acquiescence. To fail to protect the product of an individuals mind is to declare that<br>
all minds are slaves to society, that the individual has no rights at all. That is a<br>
collevtivist, subjectivist, post modern scam if ever I heard one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In the same way,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a feudal lord is not breaking the law when he exploits his serfs;</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather he defines the law in such a way as to make his actions legal.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree that his actions SHOULD be illegal, but not because it's theft, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; because rigged laws are economically inefficient, and thus fail to maxmize</i><br>
<i>&gt; utility.  In contrast, I argue that intellectual property should not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforced, because doing so is not ecnomically efficent, and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; fails to maximize utility.</i><br>
<p>
Fails to maximize the utility of what or who?? Society? Sorry, society has no rights, and<br>
is not entitled to its own utility. Lack of intellectual property is enslavement of the<br>
mind to the collective. Bye Bye BORG.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; All you are doing is akin to an attempt to legislate PI to equal 3.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Seems to me that this line could be used by anyone against anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagrees with them politically.  Empty rhetoric, I say; I could just as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well say the same thing to you.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly. As history has shown intellectual property works (American history). Lack thereof<br>
does not work (most everywhere else's history)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Get off your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; subjectivist, post modern butt and pay for what you use. No free lunches.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm no subjectivist, nor am I politically postmodern.  Politically, I am a</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian, and I justify my views through utilitarian principles.</i><br>
<p>
Are you utilitarian or libertarian. There is a distinct difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; support property rights because they are better for us than socialism, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they are objectively morally right.  I am also fully prepared to</i><br>
<i>&gt; pay for my choice of property rights in the deadweight loss which would</i><br>
<i>&gt; result from economic inefficiency.  Are you prepared to pay the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcing a bad law?  Or were you looking for that free lunch yourself?</i><br>
<p>
You have yet to objectively and scientifically demonstrate that it is a bad law. The only<br>
dead weight here are those who steal the product of another's mind.<br>
