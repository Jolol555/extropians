<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   As we agree, the old absurd Aristotelian identity </i><br>
<i>&gt;   laws need to cite the holistic-identity structure </i><br>
<i>&gt;   in which A is A only relative to -A. As such, 1 </i><br>
<i>&gt;   is 1, not due to its relation to itself, but 1 </i><br>
<i>&gt;   is 1 fundamentally due to its relation to 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Toward holistic revision, you have suggested </i><br>
<i>&gt;   that "with respect to 0" be added to the Three</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Laws of Thought in accord with zero mechanics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Having established that 1 is the 0/1 relation,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   we have 1, we've "achieved" identity, and this </i><br>
<i>&gt;   0/1 relation is a holism, it is a whole set with </i><br>
<i>&gt;   subsets, or subfeatures dependent upon the whole. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   An issue we disagree on is does the addition of </i><br>
<i>&gt;   other identities relating to 0 into our universe </i><br>
<i>&gt;   of discourse change the identity of the first </i><br>
<i>&gt;   0/1 relation that we had. You say no, I say yes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Our universe of discourse (U) contains the 0/1 relation:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	   0/1</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Now we add several more relations, none same as 0/1:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	   0/1   0/9</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	   0/6   0/4</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   In the first case, 0/1 was 100% of U, now the 0/1 </i><br>
<i>&gt;   relation is only one-fourth of U, now it *is* LESS </i><br>
<i>&gt;   relative to the whole. We can now also say that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;   0/1 relation is unique. When we say A is _____(fill </i><br>
<i>&gt;   in the blank), what it is is an attribute of its </i><br>
<i>&gt;   identity, and as we can see, adding new relations</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to U has added new identity attributes to 0/1,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and as such, identity is a holistic function.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Why Holism is Absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   100% holism always wins, for even if we disagree </i><br>
<i>&gt;   with the above and instead believe that the 0/1 </i><br>
<i>&gt;   relation has NOT changed, then this identified </i><br>
<i>&gt;   state of "not-change" (not-C) is "not-C" relative, </i><br>
<i>&gt;   and only relative, to C, and thus the non-changing </i><br>
<i>&gt;   of the initial 0/1 relation is a measure of holism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The change here being that of the contents of U.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   So the examples of the relations of relations </i><br>
<i>&gt;   cited have not identified any variety of free</i><br>
<i>&gt;   identity, and as such we always have 100% holism.</i><br>
<p>
As I have constantly asserted, we OUGHT to get 100% holism: it's the same<br>
theory with different definitions.  In this case, I don't see that there's<br>
any way that you could argue that I CANNOT define identity to refer only<br>
to the A-0 partial difference.  It's just a definition, after all: I can<br>
define unicorns if I so wish.  Within that context, identity is the<br>
partial difference if you adopt the (my?) atomism set of definitions<br>
and it is the net difference if you adopt the (your?) holism set of<br>
definitions.<br>
<p>
However, a thought occurred to me today which just might sink zero<br>
mechanics as a theory.  (Gasp!)  As we both agree, zero mechanics is<br>
completely compatible with Newtonian mechanics; indeed, this may be zero<br>
mechanics's downfall.<br>
<p>
Consider objects A and B, which comprise the entire universe.  Imagine for<br>
a moment that when they were at rest they measured each other's lengths<br>
and found that both had the same length.  So their identity chart for<br>
length would look like: <br>
<p>
   A  B<br>
A  0  0<br>
B  0  0<br>
<p>
There is 0 difference between A's length and A's length; nor is there any<br>
difference between A's length and B's length.  The chart sums to zero.<br>
So far, so good.<br>
<p>
Now let us suppose that they change their speed relative to each other to<br>
something quite large; 0.6c.  The velocity of A-&gt;B is 0.6c, B-&gt;A is -0.6c. <br>
A-&gt;A = B-&gt;B = 0.  Sum them all, you get zero.  Again, so far, so good. <br>
<p>
But let's go back to observing their lengths again.  According to special<br>
relativity, A and B would EACH observe each other's lengths to have<br>
contracted, while their own lengths remained the same (again, relative to<br>
each).  To be precise, A observes B's length to be 80% of what it<br>
once was; B observes A's length to have contracted in the same way.  Let's<br>
call the magnitude of this change C.  Now let's look at our identity<br>
chart:<br>
<p>
   A  B<br>
A  0 -C<br>
B -C  0<br>
<p>
This chart sums to -2C, violating a principle of zero mechanics, and<br>
ruining net identity's whole day.<br>
<p>
Of course, so long as we take on an (my) atomistic definition, we're fine. <br>
There is no principle of zero mechanics inherent in atomism, so we avoid<br>
this problem entirely.  Interesting, no? <br>
