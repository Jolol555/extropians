This is another of those threads that seem to reincarnate from time to<br>
time. The appeal is obvious: a place where we can be free and do what<br>
we want to do. Great! But then reality intrudes, and we get all the<br>
problems of practicalities of sea engineering, silly laws about<br>
territories, the worry about defenses, and eventually it tend to run<br>
into the perennial libertarian discussion. There have been several<br>
similar projects beside Oceania, and none have succeeded (most never<br>
left the paper). The reason seems to be that while a lot of people<br>
like the idea, few are really wanting to pay a lot to participate, and<br>
you need serious funding and planning for a project like this. This is<br>
actually a worry I have about the Millennial Project, which at least<br>
has thought about making the islands profitable from the start.<br>
<p>
Maybe we should rethink the question. Last time this thread of<br>
building an extropia came up people began to discuss various islands<br>
instead. After all, a completely independent new nation might be<br>
overdoing it, it might be enough to have breathing room. Maybe one<br>
could back down even further: the most important thing in order to<br>
really create a working community for this kind of project is of<br>
course the community itself. Where it is and what jurisdiction is<br>
involved is really secondary, since if you don't have the community in<br>
the first place there is no way you could make the floating island<br>
work. It is a good idea to figure out how to build the core community<br>
and test it out first before trying to achieve soverignity.<br>
<p>
What form the community might have is interesting. Right now we have<br>
the extropian nexi, and one could imagine something like an<br>
employee-owned transhumanist corporation that grows out from it. If we<br>
can create transhuman communities that have not just social but also<br>
economical potential I think we will be on to something.<br>
<p>
<p>
To sum up: I want to live in Oceania/New Utopia/Stateless too, but we<br>
need more than a loophole in UN regulations to do it. It might be<br>
better to start with thinking of how to create transhumanist<br>
companies.<br>
