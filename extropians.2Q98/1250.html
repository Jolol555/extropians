<i>&gt;In other words, the artist should get paid a certain amount for </i><br>
<i>&gt;writing the book (who pays, and why?) without regard to whether many </i><br>
<i>&gt;people prove they like it by, for example, buying copies.</i><br>
<p>
An author sells the first copy to a private entity.  The market decides<br>
whether someone wants to buy it.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, a publisher will invest in new books, because having a new book<br>
on the market should increase the total demand for books (from which, as an<br>
externality, all publishers will benefit).  However, the first buyer will<br>
gain in part from that increase in demand.  So as long as the increased<br>
profit you get from increased demand outweighs the price the publisher must<br>
pay the author for making the book, buying new art is still worthwhile,<br>
though less worthwhile than it was when the government was granting<br>
publishers monopoly status over copies of their books.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And in general it is never reasonable to spread the cost of </i><br>
<i>&gt;production facilities (the author's work is an essential part of </i><br>
<i>&gt;producing a book) over the entire production run.  The author must </i><br>
<i>&gt;get his entire compensation for producing the book out of the sale </i><br>
<i>&gt;price of the first book; the printer must get his entire </i><br>
<i>&gt;compensation for creating the printshop out of the first item he </i><br>
<i>&gt;prints.</i><br>
<p>
As usual, you are confusing the production of COPIES with the creation of<br>
NEW ART.  The guy who invents a printshop must get his entire compensation<br>
from inventing the first printshop.  The printer gets her compensation from<br>
printing books.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The cost of building an auto manufacturing plant should be </i><br>
<i>&gt;tacked IN ITS ENTIRETY onto the FIRST car that plant produces.</i><br>
<p>
No.  The cost of INVENTING an auto manufacturing plant must be tacked onto<br>
the first plant.  The cost of BUILDING a plant which has already been<br>
invented should be paid with the sales of every car which that plant<br>
produces.  See the difference?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yet you assume that this will somehow INCREASE the number of books being </i><br>
<i>&gt;written...</i><br>
<p>
And yet again, you confuse books being written and books being printed.  I<br>
contend that fewer books will be written but more copies of those books<br>
will be printed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Higher price?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is true, if you want to hear the group Sublime, you will have to </i><br>
<i>&gt;hire the group to come to you, and this will cost more than if you </i><br>
<i>&gt;could just run down and buy a CD.</i><br>
<p>
I could pay them a high price to make a CD for me.  Or they could produce a<br>
CD and sell it to the highest bidder.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, it is also true that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;maximum you are likely to pay is far, far less than their portion of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the sales price of a quarter million CDs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, YOU pay a HIGHER price, but THEY collect a LOWER price.</i><br>
<p>
Well, to some extent, we might expect this a little, seeing as it is a<br>
system consisting of hundreds of thousands of tiny government enforced<br>
monopolies.  So I concede, the CD industry would lose some revenues due to<br>
the abolition of their monopolies.  However, so did the aviation industry<br>
lose some revenues when it couldn't use the government to cartelize.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not to mention that all the people involved in producing, shipping, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and marketing the CDs, must seek some other source of income -- not </i><br>
<i>&gt;because their jobs are obsolete, but because we deny creative people </i><br>
<i>&gt;ownership of their creations.</i><br>
<p>
Again, CDs would and could be produced, shipped and marketed just as they<br>
have been; only they would cost a lot less.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You are entirely free, today, to write books and give them away if </i><br>
<i>&gt;you choose.  You were not free, then, to open an airline and give </i><br>
<i>&gt;away air transportation.</i><br>
<p>
Again, you confuse new art with copies.  I am free to write books, but I am<br>
not free to print copies of books which the government will not let me<br>
print, even if I give them away.  Even if I have no prior contract with the<br>
author.  (Especially in that case.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; In this case, by not allowing new companies to make copies, the artist</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gains a coerced monopoly over book copies; as a result, the artist can set</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a much higher price than the copies are actually worth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No company other than United Airlines ever has, or ever will, provide </i><br>
<i>&gt;you a flight on United Airlines' work.  So if you ever had a United </i><br>
<i>&gt;Airlines flight, United Airlines was rewarded for your benefitting </i><br>
<i>&gt;from their work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anybody can go to a cheap copier and provide you a flight on Anne </i><br>
<i>&gt;McCaffrey's work.  And Anne McCaffrey will receive no reward for your </i><br>
<i>&gt;benefitting from her work.</i><br>
<p>
Without copyright, McCaffrey would have received all of her rewards when<br>
she was paid for writing the novel in the first place.  So, yes, she would<br>
receive no FURTHER reward.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That said, I agree with you: setting a minimum price which people </i><br>
<i>&gt;*must* charge for their work, is wrong.  But instead you propose to </i><br>
<i>&gt;set a *maximum* price, and that is just as wrong.</i><br>
<p>
The deregulation of a monopoly is not the same as setting a maximum price;<br>
it's letting the market set the price at a reasonable level.  The market,<br>
today, does not set the price of copies of _DragonFlight_, but rather the<br>
government grants the copyright holder of _DragonFlight_ monopoly status<br>
over all copies of the book, so they can set the price to whatever they<br>
want, with no fear of having to lower their price due to competition.  The<br>
demand curve still dictates the revenues, but it is the copyright holder<br>
which determines the price.  We'd be better off without this monopoly and<br>
allowing the market to set the price of _DragonFlight_ copies, when prices<br>
are pushed down by firms competing for business.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The novel-reader is not buying the work of the novel-writer.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; novel-reader is receiving the work of the novel-printer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What are those black marks on the pages?  Their arrangement is the </i><br>
<i>&gt;work of the novel-writer.  If you think that it is the </i><br>
<i>&gt;novel-printer's work that matters, go buy a hundred pages of notebook </i><br>
<i>&gt;filler paper and enjoy your reading.</i><br>
<p>
When I said the above, I said it in the same way that I would say that I am<br>
not buying crude oil when I buy gasoline.  Now, obviously, the creation of<br>
gasoline would be impossible if no one were to pump crude oil; however, *I*<br>
do not have to pay crude oil companies for my gasoline.  My individual<br>
gasoline station has ALREADY paid the crude oil company for its crude oil.<br>
I am buying the work of my individual gas station, who in turn has<br>
purchased the work of a refinery, who has purchased the work of a crude oil<br>
manufacturer.<br>
<p>
When I buy a copy of a book, I buy the work of a novel-printer.  The<br>
novel-printer may have paid the novel-writer for its original copy; without<br>
copyright it may simply have purchased the work of another novel-printer.<br>
Either way, I do not pay the novel-writer for the book.  I pay a bookstore,<br>
who in turn pays a printer, [who in turn pays a novel-printer, if it is not<br>
the last on the chain,] who in turn pays the novel-writer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The writer should be paid according to the agreement the writer makes </i><br>
<i>&gt;with the publisher.  You should not have the right to dictate the </i><br>
<i>&gt;terms of that agreement, considering that you are neither the writer </i><br>
<i>&gt;nor the publisher.  Sometimes the agreement will specify that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;publisher is paying only for a mold, and sometimes it's on a per-copy </i><br>
<i>&gt;basis.</i><br>
<p>
True, I have no right to do so, nor do I wish to do so.  However, I put<br>
forward that they have no right stop me from producing my own copies of the<br>
same book at a cheaper price, unless they have a contract over me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What we find in general in the fixed arts (which means, pretty much </i><br>
<i>&gt;everything except live performances) is that the top artists are paid </i><br>
<i>&gt;on some form of per-copy basis, and the hacks are paid for molds.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;And the hacks hope to get per-copy contracts.  Some of them </i><br>
<i>&gt;eventually become top artists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Writing specifically is a bit different, but not a whole lot </i><br>
<i>&gt;different.  Magazines pay for molds.  Book contracts are almost </i><br>
<i>&gt;always on a per-copy basis, with an "advance" that is non-refundable </i><br>
<i>&gt;and amounts to a payment for the mold if the book doesn't sell well.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Let me give you a clue: if you spend six months per book, and never </i><br>
<i>&gt;get any payment beyond the advance, you won't be able to live for </i><br>
<i>&gt;long as a book writer.  But you propose to eliminate all other </i><br>
<i>&gt;payment, and believe that this will increase the amount of art.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  COPIES, *NOT NEW ART*.  And I'm not surprised that most artists vie<br>
for government-protected status.  As for whether an advance is sufficent to<br>
live off of, keep in mind that today the advance is only part of the<br>
payment, whereas tomorrow it would represent the full price of the book.<br>
So we may expect to see this price change as an actual market begins to form.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Look at it further down the line: a publisher starts printing a book </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the belief that for a certain amount of time HE will be the ONLY </i><br>
<i>&gt;publisher of that specific book.  On this basis he dedicates the </i><br>
<i>&gt;substantial capital of a printing plant to that book for a period of </i><br>
<i>&gt;time, and he puts some effort into marketing the book.  And he </i><br>
<i>&gt;enforces his copyright to protect that assumption.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But you choose to eliminate the copyright.  The publisher sends the </i><br>
<i>&gt;books out of his shop.  Of the first five boxes, three go to </i><br>
<i>&gt;copy-shop chains.  The publisher paid the author an advance, and put </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the capital and resources to print 25,000 copies of the book; the </i><br>
<i>&gt;next day there are 250,000 copies on the market.  For every dollar </i><br>
<i>&gt;the publisher spent in marketing, $8 are spent on copies of the book, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and the publisher gets 80 cents of that.  Being a publisher who </i><br>
<i>&gt;actually pays authors, is a complete loss.  So publishers won't pay </i><br>
<i>&gt;authors, and this is supposed to increase the amount of art.</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary; buying a new novel is not a complete loss if you increase<br>
sales by offering a new book.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Today, an author can auction a work to the highest bidder -- who will </i><br>
<i>&gt;probably be a publishing house and will probably pay $10,000 for a </i><br>
<i>&gt;first novel, or $1,000,000 for something from someone with multiple </i><br>
<i>&gt;previous hot sellers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Under your system, an author can auction a work to the highest bidder </i><br>
<i>&gt;-- who will probably pay $8 for a first novel, and there will be no </i><br>
<i>&gt;such thing as a "hot seller".  Why?  Because being the *second* </i><br>
<i>&gt;highest bidder means you can't publish the book -- until half an hour </i><br>
<i>&gt;after the highest bidder does.  And the 8,427th highest bidder can </i><br>
<i>&gt;publish at exactly the same time you can.</i><br>
<p>
Again, as I noted above, the book will be worth as much as publishers would<br>
benefit from the increased demand for book sales.  So it IS worth it to pay<br>
more than $8 for the first copy.<br>
<p>
How much exactly?  Best to let the market decide.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you don't think writing a good novel is hard work, try it.</i><br>
<p>
I didn't say that writing a novel is easy.  But, then, neither is flying an<br>
airplane, and I won't grant THEM monopoly status either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And you want to eliminate the means by which the market communicates </i><br>
<i>&gt;its decision.</i><br>
<p>
I most certainly do not.  I still think that authors should be paid, but<br>
shouldn't receive monopoly status on their works.  Say what you will, but<br>
don't get to thinking I'm anti-market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Under the current system, authors do bear the full cost of a failed </i><br>
<i>&gt;writing enterprise: they put all the work into writing the book, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;no publisher buys it.  On the other hand, if their writing enterprise </i><br>
<i>&gt;is successful, they reap the rewards.</i><br>
<p>
When a publisher buys a book which later fails, the publisher and author<br>
both still reap the benefits of being able to set a non-competitive price<br>
for the book so as to maximize their profits at the expense of consumers.<br>
This is NOT bearing the full cost of a writing enterprise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Under your system, authors bear the full cost of a failed writing </i><br>
<i>&gt;enterprise -- ALWAYS -- even if the book is a massive success.</i><br>
<p>
Authors who offer books which will greatly increase demand can charge more<br>
than authors who offer books which won't increase demand very much at all.<br>
Thus, authors DO benefit from writing better books; they get paid more.<br>
