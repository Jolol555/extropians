<p>
You would think that since Venus is slightly smaller, slightly less dense, and a<br>
lot hotter than Earth, that its atmosphere would have boiled off quite a while<br>
ago, yet its atmosphere is much denser and hotter than our own. Even Saturn's<br>
moon Titan has an atmophere denser than our own, though it is slightly cooler,<br>
yet Titan is not much bigger than our own moon. There is a distinct correlation<br>
between atmospheric density and tidal influence. Compared to its surface<br>
gravity, Earth has the highest level of tidal influence, yet proportionately the<br>
lowest atmospheric density of all bodies in the entire solar system. This cannot<br>
be an accident.<br>
