I have been aware of the Robotopian Law of Economics for over ten years.<br>
<p>
“With modern technology, it will soon be possible, in fact impossible to<br>
<p>
avoid, to spew out all the goods and services humanity can dream of. .<br>
.and everything will be free and no one will have to work. “<br>
<p>
A few days ago, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape described how<br>
competition and the Internet are falling in line with the Robtopian Law<br>
of Economics exactly as I have been predicting all these years.<br>
<p>
‘"We've got thousands of developers focusing their energy on this,"<br>
Andreessen said. "It's going to prove to be almost impossible to fight<br>
this.<br>
<p>
How do you fight it? It's free."’<br>

Andreessen Predicts Freeware Push<br>
(04/24/98; 4:42 p.m. ET)<br>
By Lee Pender, Computer Reseller News<br>
<p>
Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen predicted a breakthrough year for<br>
freeware today at a meeting of the Massachusetts Software Council.<br>
Netscape released the source code for its Navigator browser at the site<br>
www.mozilla.org in late March.<br>
<p>
Since then, Netscape has recorded hundreds of thousands of downloads,<br>
Andresseen said. He predicted freeware, such as the Mozilla project and<br>
the Linux operating system, <a href="http://www.linux.org">http://www.linux.org</a> will experience rapid<br>
commercial adoption beginning this year.<br>
<p>
"These projects are resulting in software that is more stable and<br>
supports a faster rate of innovation than any software company,"<br>
Andreessen said.<br>
<p>
 "It's capturing the hearts and minds of the technology industry like<br>
nothing since the Web.<br>
<p>
We're going to see broad-based use of Linux for commercial<br>
applications."<br>
<p>
Andreessen pointed to the rapid rate of innovation and development that<br>
results from the collective work of worldwide developers, as one<br>
advantage freeware has over slower-moving products from software<br>
companies.<br>
<p>
He also said freeware faces no competition because software companies<br>
cannot create an incentive as attractive as the complete lack of a price<br>
<p>
tag.<br>
<p>
"We've got thousands of developers focusing their energy on this,"<br>
Andreessen said. "It's going to prove to be almost impossible to fight<br>
this.<br>
<p>
How do you fight it? It's free."<br>
<p>
As a result, software companies are going to have to create new<br>
incentives in order to attract customers to their products, Andreessen<br>
said. Many software companies will turn to service offerings in order to<br>
<p>
make their applications attractive to potential users, he said.<br>
<p>
"Software companies are going to have to figure out how to give<br>
something away to start with, in order to get something later," he said.<br>
<p>
"The opportunity exists for many software companies to become service<br>
companies."<br>
<p>
Andreessen also said the rise of freeware has begun to even the playing<br>
field between his company and rival Microsoft. Microsoft has been<br>
rapidly gaining market share recently with its Internet Explorer<br>
browser, which is currently at the heart of an investigation by the U.S.<br>
<p>
Department of Justice.<br>
<p>
"It's become much more of a Coke versus Pepsi thing than a Windows<br>
versus Mac thing," he said.<br>
<p>
Andreessen took a shot at Microsoft when discussing the future of the PC<br>
<p>
industry. He predicted the PC will eventually become a giveaway product<br>
tied to a service contract, usinga plan similar to those that cellular<br>
phone companies now use.<br>
<p>
That will happen, Andreessen said, because software development,<br>
specifically by Microsoft, is not keeping up with hardware advancements.<br>
<p>
Consumers and organizations will not need to buy new, high-end<br>
PCs,because they can run almost every known softwareapplication on<br>
standard PCs, for which prices are constantlyfalling, he said.<br>
<p>
"There's an old saying in the computer industry that Andy giveth but<br>
Bill taketh away," Andreessen said, referring to former Intel Chairman<br>
Andy Grove. "And Microsoft comes out with software that runs much<br>
slower. A modern $800 PC is capable of running everything we know<br>
today."<br>
<p>
As a result, the PC itself will eventually experience price drops down<br>
to negligible fees or no price at all, he said.  "PC prices are going to<br>
<p>
go straight to zero and below zero,"<br>
<p>
Andreessen said. "You start to envision a world in<br>
which you have companies trying to get you to use their PCs."<br>
<p>
The result, he said, would harm chip maker Intel but would be a benefit<br>
for Microsoft, which could continue to sell its operating system. The<br>
result could be a split in the partnership of the two companies that are<br>
<p>
commonly referred to as the Wintel monopoly, he said.<br>
<p>
"Microsoft would love to see PC price points go to zero,"<br>
<p>
Andreessen said. "Intel would hate to see it happen."<br>
<p>
Andreessen took one final shot at Microsoft when he mentioned a new<br>
initiative that would incorporate Windows technology into heart monitors<br>
<p>
at hospitals.<br>
<p>
"It's the kind of product that creates its own market," he said.<br>
"You have heart problems just thinking about it."<br>
