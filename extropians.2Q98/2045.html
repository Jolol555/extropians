I LOVE people.  I think they're great.  People are by far the niftiest<br>
things on earth, IMO.  I love my friends especially, not all of whom are<br>
transhumanists.  That makes me sad, because it means I'm going to lose<br>
someone I love, but I don't think less of them for doing so.  Maybe this<br>
is completely attitudinal, but there are so many good people out there<br>
with so much great stuff going on in their minds (even if it's not all<br>
rational!)... it's mindboggling.<br>
<p>
If you haven't seen much goodness in people, maybe you haven't been<br>
looking hard enough.  I see it all the time, in everybody I see and talk<br>
to.  It's different from the kind of intelligence you'll find here, but<br>
it's very special, and I consider it a special treat when people are<br>
willing to share it with me. <br>
<p>
Call me a dynamic optimist, but I think people are good, basically<br>
rational, and nifty to be around, even when they disagree with me.<br>
