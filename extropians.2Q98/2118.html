<i>&gt; From: Bryan Moss &lt;bryan.moss@dial.pipex.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's say an imaginary "Mr. X" wanted to post a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "uncensored" message to the list, what - in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; purely hypothetical sense - might that message</i><br>
<i>&gt; consist of?</i><br>
<p>
Can't tell you that on this public list ;-)<br>
<p>
Just think of the biggest taboos today's society has, taboos <br>
so bad that you need a private, incripted list to discuss them.<br>
Actually, people (listmembers) have complained about the<br>
bad PR of topics like grey goo, superminds stepping on humans<br>
as if they were ants, the stupidity of most people, saying <br>
transhumanism is superior to other philosophies etc, etc.<br>
<p>
The logical consequence is of course to have these discussions<br>
on a separate list, so that people can speak freely for once,<br>
without having the weight of being co-responsible for the PR of the<br>
whole movement on their shoulders, or having to worry about<br>
being harassed or even prosecuted because of what they<br>
write.<br>
<p>
Is this such a stupid idea? We all want good PR and protection<br>
of our privacy, right? Yet we also want to be able to speak freely, <br>
and to say very controversial things if necessary (and if you've <br>
nothing "socially unacceptable" to say, then you're simply not <br>
thinking hard enough). This is the way to do it.<br>
