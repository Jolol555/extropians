   IAN: So "some cults are negative" and you think<br>
   "extropian ideas are negative," therefore ExI <br>
   is a cult. Supported further by the fact that <br>
   ExI holds regular meetings, and therefore per-<br>
   forms "rituals." Why bother with such strained<br>
   argumentation to achieve an insult? Just argue<br>
   over the philosophical principles.  The insult<br>
   thing is just an ad hominem variety of counter.<br>
<p>
   BTW, your comments on the "optimism" post were <br>
   very enlightening and wise.  My revolutionary <br>
   style is exactly what I've felt is reckless.<br>
   But I have trouble breaking out of it. Full<br>
   frontal attacks on a cover-up may in fact <br>
   only make it dig its heels in deeper.??<br>
<p>
   Maybe you should also consider such with <br>
   respect to your attacks on Extropianism.<br>
   The way to change things is to work with<br>
   them, not to insult and demolish them.<br>
