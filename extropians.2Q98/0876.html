I'm getting the feeling that I've sent off thousands ofreplies to this list<br>
today. Well, I'm one of those guys that cannot leave a mail unanswered.<br>

<i>&gt;Ah, yes, and such a look at history would have no doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt;given Benjamin Franklin a good idea as to whether, say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;horseless carraiges were likely.</i><br>

You cannot compare technological innovation to social and economic models.<br>
Most social and economic models of today can be found in the far past.<br>
Primitive cultures often have councils or single leaders, the Roman Republic<br>
is often compared to democracy and so on. Although the names differ, there<br>
are not many possible power constellations and economic systems.<br>
<p>
World history should give some examples for free markets in larger<br>
societies, if they were possible and useful. According to my knowledge, it<br>
doesn't.<br>
