Nico Myowna wrote 4/11/98: &lt;Reilly, all phenomenons are relative to the<br>
relativity of time and space.  This relativism is true: In our experience<br>
is there only one time -- but if we send a atomary watch (A) with a space<br>
shuttle around earth and have an other similar runing atomary watch (B) on<br>
earth than there is a time difference between A and B after A has returning<br>
from space.&gt;<br>
<p>
This time difference is a function of the measuring mechanism itself.  You<br>
are not saying that the Planck moment has changed during the flight, are<br>
you?  Is the Planck moment constant or is it not?<br>
<p>
As long as you bring up science here, I'll address some comments made by<br>
the Merry Guillotiner on 4/9/98:<br>
<p>
&lt;Your philosophy is cutting edge, cutting edge for the 13'th century that<br>
is, the same is true of your science....  The speed of light is absolute,<br>
it's the same for any observer....  And you've also rejected Quantum<br>
Mechanics, I think that's part of your credibility problem.  After dumping<br>
on the two greatest intellectual  accomplishments of the century it's hard<br>
to get people to sit contentedly at your feet while you [unpleasant blah,<br>
blah, blah].&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree that the speed of light being the same for any observer is<br>
absolute, an absolute metaphysical assumption.  Verification continues... <br>
This is science, not mysticism.  I have not rejected QM, I have simply<br>
noted that QM and Relativity are not reconciled, and they are not<br>
reconciled for a reason that science has not discovered yet.  They have not<br>
discovered it yet because something is wrong with some of the metaphysical<br>
assumptions underlying the current Kuhnian paradigm and it is very hard to<br>
buck dogmatism when you are trying to suck in grant money.<br>
<p>
I also can't believe that individuals who proclaim themselves to be<br>
scientists, promote the Big Bang as science.  Creation ex nihilo was<br>
formulated as a pious scientific doctrine at the Fourth Lateran Council in<br>
1215.  All the kooky machinations undergone since then to undergird this<br>
doctrine resemble Ptolemy's increasingly convoluted epicycles more than<br>
anything else.<br>
<p>
There is a lot of kookiness in science I don't go for.  Time travel, for<br>
one.  Utterly senseless.  Basement or attic universes for another, unless<br>
the Planck moment for each is different from ours and different from each<br>
other, then I'd be willing to entertain the idea.  Singularities inside<br>
black holes for another.  Black holes are just like glaciers, if you want<br>
to free up the matter in them, just raise the background temperature around<br>
them.  The idea of a space-time continuum for another, I'd go for a<br>
space-time conjunction or a space continuum, though.  The Planck moment is<br>
not a variable, not involved in any continuum, at least not locally anyway.<br>
 I don't just pick on junk physics either, biology makes no sense when it<br>
takes randomness (as in mutations) to be some ontological aspect, rather<br>
than an epistemological aspect.  If there was one ounce of ontological<br>
randomness in the universe, the universe would be entirely unintelligible.<br>
<p>
Lastly, I can't think of any greater credibility problem that to take<br>
information as an ontological primitive.  Information has no existence<br>
without a knower and a known.  It is a common fallacy to say that DNA<br>
transmits information, without referencing the knower who can translate the<br>
information.  DNA replication, the thing-in-itself, is not transmitting<br>
information, it is simply molecules bumping around and lining up in<br>
preferred developmental branches.  The "everything is digital" worldview I<br>
always held to be harmless idiocy until I was shown that it leads to a<br>
mandate to guillotine half my state.  I will take it seriously now.<br>
