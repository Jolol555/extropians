Er, good point.  Not thinking in a metalanguage leaves you prone to these<br>
sorts of errors.  Instead, you might add statements of precision to each<br>
of your values, or simply presume that each of these values were precise<br>
to their least significant digit.<br>

<p>
I wholeheartedly disagree.  If blue were defined to be any light within<br>
the wavelengths 549nm and 551nm (where both of these values have perfect<br>
precision; they are simply part of our definition after all) then the<br>
definition of blue cannot become stronger or weaker.  More information<br>
will only tell us whether certain wavelengths (ie 551.00 +/- 1nm) are, for<br>
example, truly blue.  Not that this is a particularly USEFUL definition,<br>
of course, but you get the idea.<br>
<p>
(On an unrelated note, is 550nm really blue?  That number sounds wrong,<br>
for some reason...)<br>
