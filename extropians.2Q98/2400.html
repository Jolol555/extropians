<i>&gt; Michael,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As someone with an intense historical interest in the development of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian faith, I'm intrigued by some of the points you've made.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; b) while the East has had a long tradition of very pacifistic spiritual</i><br>
<i>&gt; development prior to Buddha, there was none such (except for small groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Essenes) in the Middle East or Europe at the time of Jesus, he was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a pioneer in the region for what he had to say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, from my reading, I have the impression that almost nothing he</i><br>
<i>&gt; purportedly said or did was original with him. What do you think is unique</i><br>
<i>&gt; about his teaching?</i><br>
<p>
He culled much from different sources. What made him different to the original<br>
Jewish followers was he had a royal pedigree. Just as people are more likely to<br>
listen to JFK, Jr. than Nutty Joe Wingnut, those who followed him were more<br>
likely to listen to him due to his family heritage than the hundreds or<br>
thousands of other run of the mill street corner prophets that were around at<br>
the time.<br>
<p>
The other thing that was different about early Christianity was its openness to<br>
non-Jews. Most other similar sects that had similar teachings as Jesus typically<br>
restricted themselves to the ethnic group they originated in. Any spread was<br>
usually by that ethnic group forcing it on people they conquered. Thus the<br>
franchising potential for this new sect was much greater than other sects. As to<br>
why this is different from India, I can say that while India had its long Hindu<br>
tradition before Buddha, that was in many ways much much more pacifistic than<br>
the strict totalitarian Solar worship of the Roman Empire.<br>
<p>
Another thing which aided its spread in the Roman Empire amongst Gentiles was<br>
that the Bible was edited to exclude any texts that put Jews in a positive<br>
light, and included those texts which actually put the majority of the blame for<br>
Christs crucifiction on the Jews, rather than on the Romans, even though he was<br>
so obviously punished in the Roman way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; c) keep in mind that the Bible as we know it is only a small part of all of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; biographical texts, and that the two gospels which were actually written by</i><br>
<i>&gt; actual disciples of Jesus were left out of the Bible because they weren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; conducive to a stern autocratic Church. The four gospels that are in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bible</i><br>
<i>&gt; were written 70-150 years after the death of Jesus, and are thus open to</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant debate as to whether the quotes attributed to Jesus are</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; what he said. The Gospel of Thomas, and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; found in the Nag Hammadi, along with a number of other texts which paint a</i><br>
<i>&gt; much</i><br>
<i>&gt; different picture of Jesus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm with you on this, except I never heard of a Gospel of Mary Magdalene. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought I knew of all of the NT apocrypha. Can you point me to a reference?</i><br>
<p>
The Nag Hammadi is known also as the Gnostic Gospels. There is a Gospel of Mary<br>
in it. Many people assume that this Mary is Christs mother, however the scene<br>
where Jesus berates Mary Magdalene's sister Martha exposes that the author is<br>
Mary Magdalene. Due to losses through time, the gospel of Mary is very small.<br>
While you can say this might also be a form of historical editing, it is more<br>
remarkable by its inclusion than by its exclusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; d) keep in mind also that Jesus was more of a political figure than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bible</i><br>
<i>&gt; lets on. Since the marriage of his two parents reunited the two Houses of</i><br>
<i>&gt; David</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and his purported marriage at Cana to Mary Magdalene would have united the</i><br>
<i>&gt; House of David with the House of Saul) he was a royal figure in Isreal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What's this about the two Houses of David? I don't find such in my studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ancient literature (not that I'm anything like an erudite scholar). And</i><br>
<i>&gt; what's the basis for asserting that Jesus married the Magdalene? I've seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; speculation on this, and it titllates my fancy, but I know of no actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; confirming evidence. I'd be greatly in your debt if you could provide</i><br>
<i>&gt; references for these contentions.</i><br>
<p>
In one gospel of the Bible, Jesus's family lineage to David is traced through<br>
his mother Mary, and in another, through his father Joseph, through different<br>
branches of Davids house, one through Solomon, and the other through Davids<br>
other wife.<br>
<p>
I've found a number of discrepancies in the Bible, as well as the Nag Hammadi,<br>
which others have also commented on, which, when I checked with my Jewish<br>
relatives, I found seem to indicate that Jesus was most probably married, and<br>
that he was most likely married to Mary Magdalene.<br>
<p>
a) Jesus is frequently called 'rabbi' in many places in many texts, in quotes of<br>
other Jewish characters in the texts. In traditional Jewish society, a man can<br>
only be a rabbi if he is married, because a rabbi can only be expected to be<br>
able to advise, console,  and judge his fellow Jew if he is experienced in all<br>
aspects of life.<br>
<p>
b) The wedding at Cana: When the servants run out of wine, they are told to seek<br>
out Jesus for a solution. In Jewish weddings, it is the grooms family that<br>
traditionally paid for the wedding, I am told, so the guy who provided the wine<br>
is the obvious person to go to if you run out, eh???? Jesus being a teen ager<br>
was the right age for an arranged marriage, since Jewish boys become men<br>
traditionally at age 13.<br>
<p>
c) In Jewish law, if a wife commits adultery, it is her husband who must press<br>
charges. This is why the adulteress (who it turns out through more serious<br>
scholarship is in fact Mary Magdalene) is brought before Jesus for judgement,<br>
she is his wife.<br>
<p>
d) In the scene where Jesus berates Martha for complaining about Mary's rapt<br>
focus on the words of Jesus, while ignoring household chores that Martha is so<br>
busy with. In traditional Jewish families, spinster sisters that are brought<br>
into the household are typically expected to perform a large measure of the<br>
housework, and in large households is in charge of the servants. In the Gospel<br>
of Mary, Jesus is quoted as saying that Mary holds 'the favored place', and that<br>
Martha should not berate her for her good fortune.<br>
<p>
e) Mary Magdalene, according so some sources I have heard of, is descended from<br>
King Saul, the first Isreali King.<br>
<p>
Thus it is rather obvious as to why the Romans were so keen on stringing Jesus<br>
up, eh? Reuniting all of the houses and tribes of Isreal under one man (who<br>
would probably have been Jesus, or possibly his son by Mary Magdalene) would<br>
seem to me to spell a serious threat to Roman control of Palestine through the<br>
rule of King Herod, their lackey. This also explains why King Herod was so keen<br>
on killing every child born on or around  the prophesied day in Bethlehem. In<br>
order to fulfill the prophesy, the people who worked to bring this breeding plan<br>
to fruition would have to arrange that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem on or<br>
around the right day. That Mary's cousin, who became pregnant before Mary, was<br>
also seen as giving birth to a religious leader (John the Baptist), he may have<br>
been merely a failed attempt at getting a kid on the right day to fulfill the<br>
prophesy. I think that it might be interesting to find out how many other<br>
relatives of Joseph and Mary were intermarried from the deposed royal families<br>
and had kids in relative proximity to the fateful day.<br>
