Linux is fringe. <br>
<p>
Uh? Hardly. I know a lot of people who use it, almost the whole of the<br>
academia, occasional patches in business (see Sixt, many web servers), <br>
and the majority of hackers.<br>
<p>
The user statistics about Linux (like the ones recently published by<br>
Wired) seem ridiculously high to me. <br>
<p>
Too high, yes. But distincly less than one order of magnitude incorrect.<br>
<p>
Usually, they are simply measured by the sales. But of the hundreds of<br>
thousands who buy Redhat, how many stay with it? I had installed Linux<br>
<p>
I have no data for this. I for one, have not bought my current<br>
installation but installed it off a local ftp redhat mirror. Those<br>
distributions I buy I lent so several people.<br>
<p>
but had to drop it for lack of usable software (mainly OCR) and usable Plug &amp; Play support.  I suppose many who bought it didn't even manage to install it.<br>
<p>
PlugNPray is supported, albeit you have to configure it manually. I<br>
for one tend to configure the PnP devices with Win95.<br>
