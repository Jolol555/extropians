<i>        &gt;We know empirically that in such tasks people mostly select</i><br>

<i>        &gt;do with `hunches' - the `lucky' numbers in their astrological</i><br>
<i>        &gt;charts, the days of the month of their kids' or other loved</i><br>
<i>        &gt;ones' birthdays, etc.  </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
They sure seems like hunches to me. If psi exists we have not the slightest <br>
idea how it works and so we're unjustified in throwing data out just because <br>
it doesn't work. Birthdays, astrological charts, and interesting patterns on <br>
play slips are as legitimate as anything else. There is a insidious trap in <br>
science that should be feared, unconsciously "correcting" the raw data until <br>
the desired results are obtained.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Perhaps the most intriguing finding in my study is that people by         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and large *can't* be following evanescent `hunches', because their         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;behaviour is so rote. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Who says hunches must be evanescent? If I had a hunch that there was one <br>
chance in a thousand that a particular 12 digit number would win I'd play it <br>
every week for the rest of my life.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;a catastrophic earthquake, or bad weather for the picnic, or a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;market slump, are each encodable as just one bit of data. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
If it exists it seems to me psi would have to deal with a lot more than one <br>
bit because you'd have to know what the bit refers to.  Before you can <br>
receive an answer you must ask a question, just exactly how do  you explain <br>
to psi that you want to know if particular city at a particular place on the <br>
Earth's crust will experience an earthquake of a particular size at a <br>
particular time? First you'd have to explain to psi that an earthquake is a <br>
large scale movement of rock, then you'd have to explain what rock is and <br>
exactly what you mean by "large scale movement". Most earthquake predictions <br>
mentions the Richter scale and that involves the amount and rate of energy <br>
that is released. That's not a simple thing to determine and you certainly <br>
can't do it with one bit.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;In the USA you can win about 10$ if you guess 3 out of the 6 numbers         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;in any order, the number of these small winners is in the millions         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;and the number is just what you'd expect if the psi effect was zero.</i><br>
                   <br>
<i>        &gt;Good point.  But how do you know the outcomes are random?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The state makes a lot of money off the lottery, if the total number of <br>
winners was significantly larger than what the laws of probability dictate  <br>
the annual budget would be in the red because of it. It may be in the red but <br>
not because of that.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;John, I believe you mentioned that you've never heard of PEAR, one         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of the major academically-affiliated anomalies research programs in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the world.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's true I've never heard of it, but if the data is as solid as you say it <br>
is then it would be the most important scientific paper in 400 years. I read <br>
a lot so I really should have hear of this interesting development by now, <br>
the fact that I have not makes me wonder if the data is really that solid.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Even Dr Ray Hyman, prime CSICOP debunker, admits that the latest</i><br>
<i>        &gt;batches of ganzfeld studies show that *something* unexplained in</i><br>
<i>        &gt;afoot.  He doesn't think it can be psi, because he argues that psi </i><br>
<i>        &gt;as classically propounded is inconsistent with QT, relativity, etc.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't think there is any question, if psi exists QT and relativity would <br>
have to be dumped, I'd be willing to do that but only if the data was very <br>
solid indeed. I know nothing of the latest research you speak of, maybe it's <br>
better, but psi's history of incredible sloppiness and outright fraud does <br>
not build much confidence.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Nobel physics laureate Brian Josephson disagrees with him, as it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;happens.           </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Josephson is a strange man and hasn't done any physics in 35 years. He <br>
started off great and discovered the Josephson Effect as a very young man in <br>
1962, but then for unknown reasons he immediately abandoned science and <br>
became a mystic. And not a very good mystic.<br>
