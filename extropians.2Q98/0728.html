OK, but the least thing a creator could do is to check if <br>
sentient entities occur in his simulation (e.g. universe). <br>
If so, he (/she/it) could make backup copies of their states <br>
just prior to their destruction. The saved backup copies could <br>
then be restored in a separate simulation (heaven/hell?).<br>
<p>
This way he doesn't disturb the simulation, but he does save <br>
the sentient beings, which after all are indirectly created <br>
by him and therefore are his responsibility.<br>
<p>
Of course that separate simulation is the same as a separate <br>
universe is to us. There is no way the sentient inhabitants <br>
of the original simulation can find out about the other <br>
simulation, but only to wait until they are restored there <br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
So, IMO a creator *can be held responsible* for the individual <br>
events in their creations.<br>
<p>
(Isn't this the same issue as a creator being responsible <br>
for any artificial sentient being(s) he has created.)<br>
<p>
By the way, at Transvision98 we will show a television documentary <br>
which will illustrate exactly this issue: "A creator of a simulation <br>
containing sentient beings is being held responsible" :-&gt;<br>
