In a message dated 98-04-16 19:49:09 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I recently discovered that several cryonicists have frozen or plan to<br>
freeze<br>
 their pets.  It reminded me of an old sci-fi tale (Heinlein, perhaps) about<br>
 a future in which pets had evolved in sync with humans and were able to<br>
 communicate, reason abstractly, use metacognition, etc...in short, they<br>
 evolved into what we are today while their masters had advanced that much<br>
 further.  Has this been discussed on this newsgroup?  Do extropians promote<br>
 or accept the idea of accelerating the development of non-human species and<br>
 if so...under what circumstances?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Havent there been experiments where they froze a dog for a few weeks then<br>
thawed it and it came back to life?<br>
