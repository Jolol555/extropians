Looks like its time for me to jump in.<br>
<p>
After many months of y2k research and thought, I loudly and arrogantly<br>
proclaim myself uniquely qualified among extropians to mouth off re y2k.<br>
Sort of.<br>
<p>
First off, if you follow the url about Gary North, Hal Finney recently<br>
posted, you'll find that he does NOT believe in an impending second<br>
coming or revelations predicted apocalypse. In fact, he chides<br>
christians who rather than attempting to solve social problems, just<br>
ignore them and say that jesus is coming. While I am wary of the<br>
religiosity of sources, his brand of christianity is much less annoying<br>
to me than the millenialists who he is accused of belonging to. One<br>
poster accused North of outright fabrication on his web site. If you<br>
check it out, you'll see that the heart of his site is LINKS to other<br>
sources, many of them with very different views than his, plus editorial<br>
comment on the sources. I would like to see one specific lie brought to<br>
light as an example.<br>
<p>
Another concern was the nature of the posters on certain y2k forums. Try<br>
comp.software.year-2000. A large number of very experienced mainframe<br>
and other programmers, many working on y2k issues, post there.<br>
Admittedly, you also get Paul Milne, a non programmer who paints some of<br>
the scariest post y2k scenarios, and is annoyingly christian (though<br>
again, not of the millenialist variety). <br>
<p>
And Hal also took a cheap shot at Ed Yourdon. Check out his<br>
bio(somewhere on www.yourdon.com) and you'll see he has quite the<br>
reputation to risk. Is he supposed to work for free? For a view from<br>
someone with a great deal of credibility in the markets and finance, who<br>
also has y's r's d's and an n in his name, check out Ed Yardeni's y2k<br>
links on his site www.yardeni.com. He is the chief economist of nyc<br>
investment firm Deutsche Morgan Greunfell.<br>
<p>
Read the links at garynorth.com regarding the IRS, and you'll see that<br>
they're not even in the ballpark for having any kind of meaningful fix<br>
in time.<br>
<p>
And the fed printing up lots of cash to keep the banks from having to<br>
close, will only work till 01/03/2000 at best.<br>
<p>
Can someone please find an example of one fortune 2000 company that is<br>
even claiming to be fixed. Or one government above the county level.<br>
Tenessee is 70-80 percent done, but they started before almost every<br>
state - around 1990, I think, and most are still not actually fixing<br>
code. How about one major utility or telco? How bout any organization<br>
with over 20 million lines of code to fix.<br>
<p>
The electric utility industry looks to be screwed. Check out what Rick<br>
Cowles, the head of Digital's y2k utilities section, has to say at<br>
www.euy2k.com<br>
<p>
And let's not forget the y2k errors found in nuclear weapons, admitted<br>
to recently by Clinton's newly appointed y2k czar, John Koskinen. He<br>
said something to the effect that while there is a small chance that<br>
they may actually accidentaly fire, they are more likely to fail safe.<br>
But even that destabilizes the balance of terror. Now, the world's<br>
nuclear powers have to wonder whether theirs and others' missiles now<br>
have a "best if used by date" on them of 01/01/2000.<br>
<p>
About resetting clocks to 1972, that is a clever fix for a very small<br>
number of systems. Most embeddeds have no way for the user to change the<br>
date, and dos/windows machines can't handle dates before 1980.<br>
<p>
Interesting assertion: One third of business software source code is<br>
missing<br>
<p>
Interesting assertion 2: The embedded situation may be twice the size of<br>
the mainframe y2k problem, but awareness and planning is about where it<br>
was for mainframes 2 years ago.<br>
<p>
That's enough for now.<br>
