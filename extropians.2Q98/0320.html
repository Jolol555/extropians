That's strange, I see free market capitalists as "get back to basics"<br>
people.  When compared to our natural systems, anarcho-capitalism is<br>
the most conservative of all.  It actively promotes the individual,<br>
competition, survival, and all the other aspects of Darwinism.  It<br>
promotes the active expectance, and even advocacy, of genetically<br>
pre-programmed drives. Perhaps many socialist systems should be best<br>
considered as "reactionary" responses to this, but I consider the<br>
general idea of "transcending" our genetic heritage to be sound<br>
transhumanist thought.  I certainly see no reason to consider this<br>
irrational.<br>
<p>
And although anarcho-capitalism may make a nice "means" it is<br>
certainly not the "end" - don't forget that we're transcending here. <br>
That is transcending forwards to something new, not backwards to<br>
something been and gone.  And while I too can be accused of<br>
questioning the rationality of morals and non-competitive behaviour<br>
there is something behind them.  Collective intelligence and ability<br>
to communicate emotional experience is leading to a greater move<br>
towards moral complexity.  Is this good or bad?  It's certainly bad<br>
for your system, but what about those darn socialists?<br>
