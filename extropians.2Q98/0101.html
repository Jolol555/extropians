People seem so convinced that anarcho-capitalism will collapse into nation<br>
states.    There's no checks on the powers of PPAs, except other PPAs.<br>
What's to stop them?<br>
<p>
And I ask you again, what's to stop the US military from doing EXACTLY THE<br>
SAME THING?<br>
<p>
den Otter, your state has a military, yes?  What's going to stop it from<br>
squishing your exquisite statecraft, cutting out the electronic<br>
surveillance (at least on themselves) and surpressing the masses?<br>

<p>
Widespread unemployment takes place because wages don't adjust down, even<br>
when the demand for labor falls.  Minimum wage laws are responsible in<br>
part; labor regulations also play a major role.  Moreover, keep in mind<br>
that these very same improvements in technology will also make the goods<br>
themselves much cheaper, allowing people to accept lower paying jobs and<br>
still get food on the table.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Checks and balances, so several teams of profilers who's salary depends</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the results of their work (actually, this is something that would apply</i><br>
to *all*<br>
<i>&gt;government employees -- pretty radical, eh). do the testing. So a good</i><br>
profiler <br>
<i>&gt;gets wealthy, while a bad one sees a reduction in payment followed by "the</i><br>
boot" if<br>
<i>&gt;the bad results continue. Judges, cops, clerks etc. -- the same. Just like</i><br>
in a<br>
<i>&gt;normal company. This would take on bureaucratic inefficiency at its root.</i><br>
<p>
Uhm... how do you measure the quality of a psychological profiler?  And<br>
more importantly, why wouldn't the politicians/military add your<br>
surveilance-bureaucracy-reducing regulations to the round circular file and<br>
oppress the people as they see fit?  How is this more secure than<br>
anarcho-capitalism?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, sometimes good products are suppressed </i><br>
<i>&gt;because they threaten the position of some big powerful company</i><br>
<i>&gt;that happens to operate in the same niche. Only a powerful state</i><br>
<i>&gt;can put these things right, thus achieving a higher level of progress</i><br>
<i>&gt;and product quality for the consumer to enjoy.</i><br>
<p>
I challenge you to provide even one example of such "market failures" which<br>
was not CAUSED by a powerful state.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; When I "vote" in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; always win. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Unless you buy crap of course.</i><br>
<p>
You think it's crap; but if I like it, then I win.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm quite sure your PPAs would either</i><br>
<i>&gt;be a minority from the start (the rest being totalitarian clans,</i><br>
citystates and<br>
<i>&gt;full- blown countries)</i><br>
<p>
Not if it takes place through a slow period of privitization.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;or that many, possibly all, would quickly degenerate into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;flock of hardworking, meek/scared sheep ruled by an elite of enforcers.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe, if they like it like that ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Logical,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because many people are insecure, uneducated and vulnerable to any slick</i><br>
<i>&gt;talker or bully with a gun.</i><br>
<p>
... but just in case, there are OTHER PPAs to choose from (with their own<br>
slick talkers) who will offer emancipation from the bullies.  Why wouldn't<br>
people choose that if they could?  Even the advocates of freedom have slick<br>
talkers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In *theory* you might move from a region if you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;like the resident PPA, but in reality it may proof too difficult/dangerous. </i><br>
<p>
You misunderstand how PPAs would work.  PPAs wouldn't have their own<br>
regions exclusively; their regions would overlap with many other available<br>
PPAs.  You wouldn't even have to leave your house to switch PPAs, just pick<br>
up a telephone and make a deal.  Sure, perhaps your current PPA could try<br>
to stop you... but so could the US military.  So could the military in your<br>
own imagined government.  What's stopping them?  How is this more secure<br>
than a competitive system?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex, </i><br>
<i>&gt;providing mediocre yet somehow "appealing" services and taking out</i><br>
competition<br>
<i>&gt;left and right by any means necessary. Such a PPA would become more like</i><br>
<i>&gt;a nation state with every takeover or alliance it achieved.</i><br>
<p>
So what?  The US military has the means and the incentives to do exactly<br>
that; they wouldn't even have to be slow about it, because there is no<br>
competing military in the US to stop them.  So why is this so much more<br>
secure than anarcho-capitalism?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;*If* you're indeed in a position to do so. I can well image that many</i><br>
folks would<br>
<i>&gt;have debts with their PPA, just like with the mob/state etc.No way that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;will leave in one piece, and even if so what other PPA would dare/want to </i><br>
<i>&gt;accept you in this state...unless you make even more debts and become </i><br>
<i>&gt;in fact a slave. </i><br>
<p>
And how is this different from your system?  If I've got a debt with the US<br>
military and it decides not to let me out of the country alive, what's<br>
stopping it from doing exactly the same thing?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;PPAs and other anarcho-capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt;goodies may be great in *theory*, but are in fact ivory tower productions</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;don't take human nature into account and will thus fail as have many before</i><br>
<i>&gt;them.</i><br>
<p>
I'd say the idea that you could check the power of the military simply by<br>
designing a new system of laws is the ivory tower production.<br>

If the people running some of the PPAs are stupid or of low quality, those<br>
of high quality will be at a competitive advantage to them, and thus will<br>
more likely thrive over the stupid PPAs.<br>
<p>
There is, of course, little hope for anyone if EVERYONE is stupid.  But the<br>
advantage of the market is that it rewards ingenuity, intelligence and<br>
creativity, and thus is more likely to maximize extropy than, say, a<br>
dictator, who may or may not be intelligent at all, and for whom there is<br>
no mechanism for ensuring competence.<br>
