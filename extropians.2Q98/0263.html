<i>&gt; &gt;We are in some sense underdefined, we can consciously set up our own</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The human body has been observed to work in a homestatic way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Many aspects of the human nervous system have been observed</i><br>

<i>&gt; genetically programmed to work in a homeostatic way. </i><br>
<p>
All life is homeostatic, that is the meaning after all of a metastable<br>
dissipative system: it manages to retain its structure and state by<br>
allowing energy to flow through it. But homeostasis in some dimensions<br>
(like body temperature) doesn't imply homeostasis in other dimensions<br>
(like aging).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think this carries over to the pschology of human consciousness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Human consciousness as it has evolved seems to operate in a </i><br>
<i>&gt; homeostatic way as well.</i><br>
<p>
How? In what respect? Obviously memory is not homeostatic, since it is<br>
constantly updated and changes our behavior. We have certain stable<br>
conscious states we tend to return to, but are they really long-term<br>
homeostatic and not just short-term homeostatic?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps a fundamental success </i><br>
<i>&gt; principle, or a fundamental principle for the future evolution of </i><br>
<i>&gt; trans and post human consciousness will be to overcome this homeostatic</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature of consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
I think it can be partially overcome already, since people do change<br>
from time to time. It is not easy, and obviously it would be a bad<br>
idea to change constantly since we could not retain ourselves well<br>
(although, as I speculate in a short story I wrote, posthumans might<br>
have attractors in personality space so that they appear to have<br>
stable personalities while they are actually quite fluid).<br>
