Forwarded from another mailing list.  Synopsis: clouds affect Earth's thermal<br>
budget; cosmic rays stimulate cloud formation; solar wind keeps cosmic rays<br>
away; sunsports are correlated with solar wind; particle physicists actually<br>
get to do something useful, in applying their cloud chamber experience.<br>
<p>
   On a scale of scientific importance, Dr Henrik Svensmark and Dr Eigil<br>
Friis- Christensen's research on cosmic rays and cloud formation may one day<br>
rank as a world leader.<br>
   Yet its origins were obscure and its initial impact negligible.  Pain-<br>
stakingly assembled from weather satellite data and other astonomical<br>
observations, the two Danish meterorologists' report was buried in a few<br>
pages of the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics last year.<br>
It made little impact at the time, but slowly the paper has acquired a cult<br>
status among physicists.  And it may yet prove to be a scientific milestone.<br>
   What Svensmark and Friis-Christensen discovered was simple: over the past<br>
15 years they saw an exact correlation between levels of cosmic rays hitting<br>
Earth and the proportion of the world's skies obscured by clouds.  The<br>
effect may not seem profound: a typical 20% drop in cosmic ray levels<br>
reduces cloud cover from 68 to 65%.  Nevertheless the impact for our planet<br>
is considerable.<br>
   "Clouds have a profound effect on Earth's radiation budget," says Dr<br>
Jasper Kirkby of CERN, the international centre for particle physics<br>
research at Geneva. "The more cloud cover there is, the cooler will be the<br>
climate. Fewer clouds, and the planet will warm up."<br>
   And our planet is warming up. Over the last 100 years global temperatures<br>
have risen by about .5=B0 Celsius. It had been assumed that this was the<br>
result of a steady rise in industrial activity - more and more factories,<br>
cars and homes spewing out carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,<br>
trapping the sun's heat and warming the atmosphere.<br>
   But there are inconsistencies in this simple picture. For example, global<br>
temperatures fell slightly between 1945 and 1970, a fact that cannot be<br>
explained by the steadily rising emissions over that period.<br>
   Some scientists have continued to argue that other factors must be<br>
involved. The importance of the work by Svensmark and Friis-Christensen is<br>
that they have provided these doubters with a convincing alternative<br>
candiate - cosmic rays.<br>
   Our planet is bathed in cosmic rays, a heavenly rain of sub-atomic<br>
particles that pour down upon us from deepest space.  Researchers believe<br>
that the particles were probably spewed into the cosmos by exploding=<br>
 supernovae.<br>
   Cosmic rays trigger a cascade of other particles when they strike atoms<br>
in the upper atmosphere, creating a background of natural radiation on<br>
Earth.  This radiation would not be expected to fluctuate - were it not for<br>
the sun. The sun pours out gusts of its own sub-atomic particles. We call<br>
this the solar wind. It protects Earth from cosmic rays, sweeping them away<br>
from our planet.<br>
   In other words, when the solar wind is intense, fewer cosmic rays hit<br>
Earth, cloud cover is reduced and temperatures rise.  And there is<br>
compelling evidence to support this idea because there is an easy way to<br>
tell when the solar wind is strong. Just count sunspots. The more there are,<br>
the stronger the solar wind.<br>
   Claims of a link between sunspots and the weather are not new, of course.<br>
The great astonomer William Herschel noticed that the price of wheat in 18th<br>
century England was lower when there were many sunspots and the weather was<br>
warm. In the second half of the 17th century, when sunspots almost<br>
disappeared, the Earth went through a miniature ice age.<br>
   Crucially scientists have discovered that sunspot activity has been<br>
changing radically over the past century. The solar winds have become<br>
stronger and stronger.<br>
   The only link that has yet to be established is the mechanism by which<br>
cosmic rays influence cloud formation.  This is why Kirby and Dr Frank<br>
Close, another British physicist, have proposed building a cloud detector at<br>
CERN.<br>
   This machine would recreate Earth's atmosphere. A chamer containing the<br>
gases, water vapour and aerosol particles found in our atmosphere would be<br>
battered with sub-atomic particles from one of CERN's accelerators to reveal<br>
the exact mechanism that links sunspot activity with atmospheric heating.<br>
   In this way, the expertise of the world's leading particle physicists<br>
would be brought to bear on a critical environmental issue.<br>
   If they succeed in establishing a link, a major environmental shibboleth<br>
- that mankind is responsible for the rise in global temperatures - will be<br>
destroyed, with profound political implications.  Fear that continued<br>
industrial development urgently sought by the developing world, might have<br>
devastating consequences could then be discounted, although other valid<br>
concerns about acid rain and ozone depletion would remain.<br>
