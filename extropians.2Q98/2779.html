<i>&gt; &gt; raise enough cash to build offshore Extropia.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, relatively cheap as it is, you could</i><br>

<p>
This would be entirely against the ideals of the<br>
New Utopians but could you realistically steal the<br>
money?  Actually, while I'm out on a<br>
less-than-ethical whim, how about a chemical<br>
weapons factory?  That could bring in some serious<br>
money.  Euthanasia resorts (next door to the<br>
longevity centre!)?  My own private drugs cartel?<br>
Could you hide the island in a sort of<br>
super-villain way?  We could invite homeless<br>
people (or condemned criminals) to experience<br>
paradise in exchange for them acting as human<br>
guinea pigs for our advanced medical research.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Instead of having a constitutional monarchy, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would have a complete free market, i.e. you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; buy your office/house, and it's yours.  No</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; taxes, no laws, just pure capitalism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In any case there would have to be some</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreements regarding island defense, pollution</i><br>
<i>&gt; &amp; other damaging behaviour etc.  Rudimentary</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws, but nothing like modern bureaucracies, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course. Just the "golden rule" &amp; some practical</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff.</i><br>
<p>
I'd rather have contracts between companies than a<br>
centralised system of enforcement.  Although<br>
commanding my own military has a certain appeal<br>
(especially if I get a big control room).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Start off with the monopoly on PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; services, etc. and then invite other companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to join in.  Anyone want to help out?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure, I'd love to be involved in such a project.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As I explained in other mails, the advantages of</i><br>
<i>&gt; having your own country are enormous, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; for transhumnists/cryonicists.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder if it would cost more to have your own<br>
country where you can do things declared unethical<br>
(human cloning, germ line therapy, etc.) or a<br>
research centre and a really good PR guy.<br>
