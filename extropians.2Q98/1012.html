If by poorer you mean lacking anything worth trading, then I'd say 'no'.  We<br>
could go back to the rich having lots of servants, a la the 19th century.  As<br>
someone said, a use can probably be found for any sufficiently cheap labor.<br>
Part of current Western unemployment is said to be native poor people being<br>
unwilling to take janitorial jobs which immigrants come here for.<br>
<p>
If automation was really really cheap the capital to survive might be cheap<br>
enough to purchase out of wages.  I don't know if that's plausible.<br>

I think this depends on what is considered adequate support.  Food,<br>
alternative housing in rural places, and simple clothing would cost a few<br>
thousand dollars a year, I think.  Federal poverty level for one person is 6-8<br>
grand, I think.  Supporting 100 million Americans at $4000/year would require<br>
$400 billion/year, which is less than half of what we spend on retired people<br>
now.  I suspect the West is perfectly capable of supporting huge portions of<br>
its population at a low level, at noticeable but not self destructive cost;<br>
the catch is in competing with societies which do not impose such a cost on<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
This is not within the free market, of course.<br>
<p>
<p>
Earlier Paul said that solar energy would suffice for the transition period.<br>
This seems to assume that while a nanotech economy could use arbitrary amounts<br>
of energy ours could be saturated.  I doubt this is the case, even in the<br>
short term.  I can conceive of society having a practically infinite supply of<br>
water, where all uses are fulfilled and there's not a damn thing to do with<br>
the excess.  But not energy.  There must be plenty of activities which would<br>
become profitable if energy was cheap enough.  Low-grade mining; landfill<br>
mining and recycling; carrying the extra mass of parachutes and other safety<br>
features on planes; checking for defects; creation of industrial quantities of<br>
diamond, corundum, and other high-energy materials; spaceflight.  Give me<br>
cheaper energy and I'll use it.  Say that I don't need that much to maintain<br>
my current standard of living, and I'll say that's an arbitrary peg, and those<br>
who don't work can be supported now (see above.)<br>
