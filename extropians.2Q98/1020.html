 Seems rather like industrial age thinking to assume a higher tech society<br>
would need more energy. For me the interesting problems are ones of<br>
complexity. And our most complex systems have tended to get smaller and use<br>
less energy. I figure a complex, well organized acorn-brain will be able to<br>
outhink a poorly organized Jupiter-brain.<br>
<p>
 And what is your definition of the "leisure class"? Seems to me that many<br>
people do for leisure what other people do for work. Neither are sitting on<br>
their asses. The significant difference is for a "hobby" pursuit the drive<br>
is internal rather than an external. Or are you thinking of people who<br>
watch TV?<br>

 Why? Most creative people I know (and I include myself) find the hassle of<br>
trading creations for food and shelter something we could do without. A lot<br>
of good creative output has come from people prepared to live in a garret<br>
if that is what it takes to make their idea real. If Nanotech provides easy<br>
food, shelter and medical aid, I'd be happy to pass on my output to anyone<br>
who is interested. In the meantime, the Net seems to be doing a good job of<br>
providing me a living with very little effort. So I think things are going<br>
in the right direction.<br>
<p>
  Having lurked on this list for a little while, there seems to be a divide<br>
between those who demand some payment before they do anything, and those<br>
who would like to get out of that loop. I think both choices are possible.<br>
