Dan Fabbulich, referring to the poor:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also happen to think they'll be just fine under capitalism,</i><br>
thankyouverymuch.<br>
<p>
OK, let's see whether the poor are fine under capitalism today. It has been<br>
often expressed on this list that the US are "not great, but certainly the<br>
best system there is".<br>
<p>
The facts (I cite from "Fifty Facts about Poverty" by Nancy Leidenfrost, see<br>
<a href="http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/facts.txt">http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/facts.txt</a> for the complete list together with<br>
the references):<br>
<p>
*    In 1991, the United States had approximately 35.7 million<br>
     people living below the poverty level.  This represents 14.2<br>
     percent of the Nation's population (U.S. Bureau of the<br>
     Census, 1992).<br>
<p>
*    One in five children (14.3 million) lived in poverty in<br>
     1991, the highest number since 1965.  The majority of poor<br>
     children are white; most have a parent that works; and most<br>
     live outside large cities, in rural and suburban America<br>
     (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).<br>
<p>
<p>
*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 20th<br>
     in infant mortality (UNICEF, State of World's Children,<br>
     1992, U.S. Data from NCHS, 1991).<br>
<p>
*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 17th<br>
     in the world in percentage of<br>
     1-year-olds fully vaccinated against polio (UNICEF State of<br>
     the World's Children Report 1993, 1992, U.S. Immunization<br>
     Survey, 1985).<br>
<p>
*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 14th<br>
     in life expectancy and 4th in literacy (Howell, B., 1990).<br>
<p>
*    The United States has one of the highest degrees of<br>
     inequality in distribution of income (Smeeding, T.M.,<br>
     O'Higgins, M., &amp; Rainwater, L., 1990). (I have more sources on this, if<br>
anyone wants them, just ask. -- EM)<br>
<p>
*    The United States has higher child poverty than seven other<br>
     major industrialized western countries (UNICEF, State of the<br>
     World's Children Report 1993, 1992).  The U.S. child poverty<br>
     rate is dramatically higher than those of Canada, Germany,<br>
     Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.<br>
<p>
*    America's wealth as  measured by the gross national product<br>
     (GNP) reached  an all-time high in 1990.  Between 1979 and<br>
     1989, GNP grew by more than one-fourth, but child poverty<br>
     increased by 21 percent (Johnson, C.M., Miranda, L.,<br>
     Sherman, A., &amp; Weill, J.D., 1991).<br>
<p>
*    About half of the Nation's poor in 1991 were children under<br>
     18 years of age (40.2).  Children are almost twice as likely<br>
     to be poor than any other group of Americans, including the<br>
     elderly (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).<br>
<p>
*    In 1991, the poverty rate among children in female-headed<br>
     families was 55 percent, more than five times the rate among<br>
     married-couple families (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992). (so much for<br>
equal chances -- EM)<br>
<p>
And for those who believe that the poor are not "really poor":<br>
<p>
*    Poor families are less likely to have nutritionally adequate<br>
     diets than nonpoor families.  Children who have inadequate<br>
     diets lag in growth and have more frequent, more severe, and<br>
     longer-lasting infectious diseases.  Inadequate nutrition,<br>
     including iron deficiency (with or without anemia), may also<br>
     affect cognitive development and social behavior, with<br>
     undernourished children being more apathetic (Kotch, J., &amp;<br>
     Shackelford, J., 1989).<br>
<p>
*    Poor children are believed to experience mental and<br>
     emotional problems more frequently than nonpoor ones (Gould,<br>
     M.S., Wunsch-Hitzig, R., &amp; Dohrenwend, B., 1981).  The 1987<br>
     report, Children's Mental Health: Problems and Services,<br>
     noted the relationship between poverty and minority group<br>
     membership and environmental stresses.  These stresses posed<br>
     risks to children's mental health (Dougherty, D.H., Saxe,<br>
     L.M., Cross, T., &amp; Silverman, N., 1987).<br>

What am I asking for? Socialism? Certainly not, although many Extropians<br>
still seem to believe that if one isn't a free market capitalist, he must<br>
automatically be a defender of the big evil governments and possibly a<br>
potential socialist (or a real one). These facts just show that a<br>
deregulated economy tends to produce more poverty and inequality than a<br>
correctly [!] regulated one. Add automatism to this, and you got the High<br>
Tech Middle Ages.<br>
