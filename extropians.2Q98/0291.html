<i>&gt;For example, if you were to take a starving, battered Kurd and provide</i><br>

<i>&gt;is), the kurd would likely be exstatic - would have an "enhanced"</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional state of consciousness if you will. However, after some</i><br>
<i>&gt;time, what usually happens is that that persons consciousness returns</i><br>
<i>&gt;to "homeostasis" to a point where s/he would no longer be in that</i><br>
<i>&gt;exstatic, elevated state.  (In this example) living this new lifestyle</i><br>
<i>&gt;would eventually become "normal" and blase. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This same phenomenon occurs with people who win the lottery.</i><br>
<p>
OK, I see what you mean. <br>
<p>
The two examples are actually slightly different. In both there is a<br>
sudden emotional change, but it is temporary (this is what you refer<br>
to as homeostasis). But in the lottery example, there is no real<br>
change in circumstances: the world looks about the same, and the<br>
person's cognitive model is not changed - there is just more money. So<br>
usually it is spent in accordance with the person's personality and<br>
reality map, which doesn't lead to any dramatic changes. Compare this<br>
to moving to a different culture: you cannot avoid it, it is a<br>
persistent pressure forcing you to re-value your old maps. People who<br>
move to a new culture do change, and does not return to their old<br>
selves when they move back to the old land.<br>
<p>
One could perhaps model this as elastic and plastic deformation: if<br>
you squeeze a rubber eraser it will quickly return to its original<br>
shape, but if you leave it clambed overnight it will be permanently<br>
deformed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Haven't you ever notced, either in yourself or from watching others, that often</i><br>
<i>&gt; the times of greatest pleasure are ones that involve _change_</i><br>
<i>&gt; from one situation to a much better situation. Regardless of how</i><br>
<i>&gt; "good" either of the sitatutions "actually" are.</i><br>
<p>
"Good" is not a scalar potential function (to use a physical analogy<br>
again), it changes. I think the concept of flow (a la Mihály<br>
Csíkszentmihályi ) is a good model for when we achieve true<br>
happiness. He suggested that we achieve it when we feel that our<br>
abilities are just right for the task at hand, they are being<br>
exercised at their fullest, but we also make progress. It is then we<br>
use our true capacity, and this creates what he calls mental order and<br>
leads to a growth process (I'm mangling his argument awfully here). So<br>
it is the task of moving from one situation to the other that is<br>
important, the start and end states are less important (even if it is<br>
of course much easier to feel good while moving towards a better<br>
state).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is wrong with having a highly dynamic personality? I suspect that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this may become quite common in post humans.</i><br>
<p>
It is not the dynamic personality that is troublesome (we already<br>
switch our personalities slightly to fit the situation), it is having<br>
a highly dynamic set of core goals and values that is bad. If they are<br>
too fluid, they shift before any goals can be achieved and hence the<br>
individual becomes very inefficient.<br>
