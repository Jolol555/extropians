MOVING FORWARD INTO THE PAST.  Many novelists and not<br>
a few scientists have pondered the possibility of returning to a point<br>
in one's past.  In principle physics does allow time travel via closed<br>
timelike curves (CTCs).  Along such a warped spacetime trajectory<br>
the traveler is always moving into the future (locally) but eventually<br>
finds himself back where he started from.  (Think of sailing around<br>
the world; heading west you return from the east.)   J. Richard Gott<br>
and Li-Xin Li at Princeton have speculated on whether spacetime<br>
could both allow travel into the past and insure a consistent<br>
chronology (the traveler must remember shaking hands with his<br>
older self as he sets off). They have determined that in part of space<br>
no time travel would be allowable, but in another part (separated<br>
from the first by a surface called a Cauchy horizon) a time machine<br>
could be built, subject to this restraint: if you build a time machine<br>
in the year 3000, you might be able to use it to go from 3002 to the<br>
year 3000, but not back to the year 1998 because that would have<br>
been before the machine was built.  Of course even this limited sort<br>
of time travel would be very difficult because you would need a lot<br>
spacetime warp for it to work, and this could only be provided<br>
through the agency of a black hole or a decaying cosmic string<br>
loop.  For example, to move even one microsecond back into the<br>
past would require the presence of a space-warping mass equal to<br>
one tenth the mass of the sun! And then there's no guarantee the<br>
black hole wouldn't swallow you and the space around you.  Then,<br>
as Gott says, you'd be able to circle around and meet your earlier<br>
self, but you wouldn't be able to escape to boast about it.  (Physical<br>
