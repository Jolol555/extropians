level capable of providing stimulating conversation or &gt; competition...<br>

<i>&gt;torture people forever in hell for the slightest transgression? People</i><br>
<i>&gt;it has programmed *itself* to commit those transgressions. It's like</i><br>
<i>&gt;making a creature that's always thirsty, and punishing it when it tries</i><br>

<i>&gt;conversation -- he only wants blind worship. Competition? I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt;so! When Satan and Adam &amp; Eve got too "emancipated" they got kicked out</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's why we should be glad that He is just a myth. </i><br>

<p>
I still don't see why a god or God must follow the hell and brimstone route.<br>
What if this personage created the universe as a child might create a<br>
sandcastle, and then 'grew up' and away from childish things? It might not<br>
have any idea that life arose, and even if It did, It might care as little<br>
as we do for an anthill 'way out in the woods...Why must we assume evil<br>
intent? Yes, of course, the lack of positive interaction might appear evil,<br>
especially if you are getting the short end of things because of it.<br>

<i>&gt;Strong atheism should definitely be a part of the transhuman package,</i><br>
<i>&gt;certainly if you want to teach the philosophy to novices, because</i><br>
<i>&gt;otherwise they would be easy prey for any religious fanatic. "If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything". God (and the rest</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the "supernatural") does not exist until he comes down from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;heavens in all his glory etc. People really need to get rid of that</i><br>
<i>&gt;"there must be some higher force"-meme in order to make truly rational</i><br>
<i>&gt;decisions (about cryonics, for example). The god-meme is very powerful,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in order to beat it one has to have a powerful counter-meme, not the</i><br>
<i>&gt;maybe/maybe not agnostic approach. People are going to get infected</i><br>
<i>&gt;with memes (programmed/brainwashed etc.) one way or another, that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;how we work, so better make it the transhuman/atheist/rationalist meme.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
In my younger days, I was 'born again' by close association with friends in<br>
bible churches. I outgrew this in a few weeks when I realized that they had<br>
the same lack of answers and proof as all other churches I had<br>
seen...Teenagers are most at risk, I think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Oh dear, I have been preaching again...:-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Hey, somebody's got to preach, else there can never be a force for change..<br>
