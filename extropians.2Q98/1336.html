Right.  One final down, three to go.  In the meantime...<br>

<p>
I don't understand what you mean when you say that your costs must be<br>
recovered before you make a profit.  You cover costs BY making a profit.<br>
That's the whole point.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Only if the demand magically expands to suck up all I produce. Look at what</i><br>
<i>&gt;happened to DRAM makers recently due to huge increases in supply in a finite</i><br>
<i>&gt;market.</i><br>
<p>
Careful; in microeconomics we refer to two different entities which are<br>
easily confused.  When we refer to "demand increasing" or "total demand<br>
increasing," we mean that the whole demand curve has shifted upwards (as<br>
takes place when you bring a new product to market).  However, the<br>
"quantity demanded" is a different beast altogether; the quantity demanded<br>
will increase, for example, when supply increases (ie the supply curve<br>
shifts down).<br>
<p>
As far as "magical" increases in demand, I don't think it's at all<br>
unreasonable to think that you'd get increased demand if you were offering<br>
a new product, even if others were also offering the same product,<br>
presuming that there is a profitable market for what you're selling.<br>
(DRAM, for example, may not be a profitable market at all.)  People see a<br>
new thing, so some people who want the new thing and couldn't buy it before<br>
will now start doing so.  What's so magical about that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How can all my 'knock off' competition also collect the SAME amount given a</i><br>
<i>&gt;fixed market? If there is the possibility of selling X products, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt;double the number of vendors, the profits available are X devided by each</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitor's market share. Anything else is a pyrimid scheme.</i><br>
<p>
The graphs that I showed you above were not the supply curve and demand<br>
curve for the entire market, but only for your firm.  If you were to add up<br>
the demand of all the buyers buying from you and your competitors, as well<br>
as the supply costs for you and all of your competitors, you'd get a<br>
microeconomic supply and demand graph for the market.  (They look<br>
remarkably similar, perhaps I didn't make that clear.)  In that case,<br>
you're right, the increase in demand would have to be divided evenly among<br>
the firms.<br>
<p>
However, since I was showing you only YOUR supply and demand curve, that<br>
means that your competitors would see an identical supply and demand curve<br>
facing them; thus, when you get your trapezoid, they get theirs.  The total<br>
revenue inside the sum of your trapezoid and all of your competitors is<br>
equal to the trapezoid you would find if you did a supply-demand analysis<br>
of the entire market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That is true. As long as my profits exceed my costs, I will keep on</i><br>
<i>&gt;producing, regardless of competition.</i><br>
<p>
OK, well, as I think I just demonstrated, you DO earn a profit from<br>
invention, even when there's competition.  It's given by the area inside<br>
the trapezoid, minus the sunk cost of invention.  These profits are smaller<br>
than the profits you get from monopolization, but they are still there.<br>
<p>
Thus, in the end, if the revenues inside the trapezoid are greater than the<br>
costs of invention, then you'll invent.  If not, it's not worth it, so you<br>
won't.<br>
<p>
Now, as for the monopoly analysis...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why must I lower the price? Where is this rule posted?  I don't see</i><br>
<i>&gt;Volkswagen, who has a 'monopoly' on their New Beetle, lowering the price</i><br>
<i>&gt;sequentially on each car they sell..</i><br>
<p>
No, they don't lower the PRICE sequentially, but rather the extra revenue<br>
earned on each car decreases sequentially.  They choose a point on that<br>
graph when they set ONE price and collect the area under it and above their<br>
supply curve.<br>
<p>
For example, suppose the demand curve is given by P = 10 - Q, where P is<br>
price and Q is quantity.  Now suppose you are a monopolist facing this<br>
demand curve, and that you currently sell 3, because your price is 7.  Now<br>
suppose you want to increase your Q by one, to sell one more.  Well, people<br>
won't buy four at price of 7, they'll only buy 3 at that price.  (Which is<br>
just what the demand curve told us.)  In order to get people to buy four,<br>
you'll have to lower the price.<br>
<p>
Now, this isn't saying that VW starts with their price at some<br>
extraordinarily high value at the beginning of every year and then<br>
decreases the price with each car sold.  Obviously, if they were selling<br>
cars where Q was the millions of cars sold and P was the price in thousands<br>
of dollars, they will set one price ($7) and sell a certain quantity of<br>
cars (3 millions).  However, if they want to sell 4 millions, VW must lower<br>
the price.  [This is actually a bad example, because if you don't want a VW<br>
you can always buy another car, whereas a monopolist would have cornered<br>
the entire market for all cars.]<br>
<p>
When there's lots of competitors, however, you can't set your price that<br>
way.  The market sets your prices in perfect competition, because if you<br>
raise your prices at that quantity then nobody would buy from you;<br>
meanwhile if you lower your price at that quantity you'll take a loss.<br>
Thus, your price is the same price as the entire market, and thus your<br>
marginal revenue is given by the simple demand curve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why does a monopoly have a lower MR curve? Just because you are the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;supplier, this does not affect the DEMAND for your product. Demand is quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;different from sales. Many might like to purchase a product but refrain</i><br>
<i>&gt;because the cost is too high. The demand is there, but sales lag. Once the</i><br>
<i>&gt;artificailly high price is lowered (and this DOES NOT mean that you sell</i><br>
<i>&gt;below cost!) the sales will increase. If you cut costs even further, sales</i><br>
<i>&gt;will increase to the limit of the real demand. If this happens before you</i><br>
<i>&gt;run out of margin and production capacity, you make lots of money. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;run out of supply before you can sell everything demanded, the demand does</i><br>
<i>&gt;not disappear, but raising your price will surely cause more customers to</i><br>
<i>&gt;back off and wait..</i><br>
<p>
I'm already aware of this.  But because a monopolist represents the entire<br>
market, the monopolist cannot increase the quantity sold without directly<br>
lowering its prices.  Thus, the monopolists MR curve is lower than that for<br>
a perfect competitor.<br>
<p>
I'm not making this up...  You should be able to find this in any<br>
microeconomics textbook.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Where P* and Q* are the price and quantity which would be reached by a free</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;market, and P and Q are the price and quantity which a monopoly would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;choose to maximize profits.  (I recognize that it's hard to read...  Try</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;drawing it on paper or something.)  When we keep in mind that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;consumers' surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the price</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;line, whereas the monopoly's surplus is the area above the supply curve and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;below the price line, it is clear that by setting the prices this high, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;firms are benefitting at the expense of the consumers.  Worse, we also note</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that because this quantity is lower than it would be under a free market</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;there is "deadweight loss" (the wealth which would have been created if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;market were free), represented by the area inside the triangle bounded by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the demand curve, the supply curve and the quantity line.  The part of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;triangle above the price line is that surplus which would have been earned</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by consumers; the part below this triangle is that which would have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;earned by firms.  Firms will happily sacrifice this triangle, however, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they can gain the rectangle formed by the y-axis, the monopoly price, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;quantity line, and the competitive price.  The revenues in that rectangle</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;outweigh the revenues in the triangle.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In a free market, will goods magically appear to fill all the holes?</i><br>
<p>
What magic?  Most of this stuff is true by definition: we defined the<br>
demand curve to be the price at which people would buy a certain quantity,<br>
the supply curve to be your marginal costs.  I think I have shown why the<br>
monopolist necessarily suffers from a lower marginal revenue curve, and it<br>
is self-evident that you should only produce up until the point where the<br>
revenue you would get for selling one more would be less than the costs you<br>
would earn from it (ie MR-MC=marginal profit=0).  Thus, people will pay the<br>
price given by the demand curve at that quantity, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There</i><br>
<i>&gt;are going to be second order effects - lags in development, tooling, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;that will prevent the market from being fully satisfied at least in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;beginning of sales of a new invention. Some 'profit' will always be</i><br>
<i>&gt;unreaped. This 'loss' is an imaginary quantity, since there is no way to</i><br>
<i>&gt;EVER recover it, unless you posit 'thought to production' technology..</i><br>
<p>
What do you mean by "satisfied?"  If for some reason you can't make enough<br>
to "satisfy" demand, then you'll just sell fewer; the loss in sales is<br>
deadweight loss for you and for your customers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The monopoly is only bad for consumers if it refuses to listen to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;customer's wants and needs. If the company cares about it's customers, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;will adjust their products to fit what the amrket wants.</i><br>
<p>
Once we observe that a monopolist makes more profit producing at a lower<br>
quantity and a higher price than at a competitive price and at lower<br>
quantity, we are able to restate it in another way:  a monopoly would have<br>
to start taking a loss on every extra unit sold in order to reach the<br>
competitive quantity, because in order to sell that much, the monopolist<br>
has to lower its price to a competitive price (otherwise people won't buy<br>
the competitive quantity!), further cutting into its profits.<br>
<p>
To be blunt, you'd have to be MAD to produce like that.  It simply makes no<br>
sense, once you've got monopoly status, to cut into your profits that way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;case, other firms will find ways to produce equivalent product that</i><br>
<i>&gt;sidesteps the patent, and satisfy the true wants of the market.</i><br>
<p>
I'm presuming that they can't do that in a cost effective way.  If they<br>
could, then there would be no point in having your patent anyway; instead<br>
of reverse engineering your product, they'd just develop an equivalent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If your product isn't worth making under a competitive price, but is only</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;worthwhile under government protection, maybe you should rethink whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the product is worth making at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the competitive price is arrived at by allowing anyone who happens along</i><br>
<i>&gt;to steal my idea, I might as well stay out of the market.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that was what I was trying to say.  If you can't keep afloat at a<br>
competitive price, then that's the market's way of saying "we don't want it<br>
that badly."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I don't understand what you're saying here.  As you surely know if you've</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;read my other posts on this topic, I DO think that creaters deserve rewards</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;for inventing, I just don't think they deserve monopoly status on the idea.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's pretty hard to reap profits BEFORE you sell a product, unless there's</i><br>
<i>&gt;some fairy godmother of a government agency that pays me for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;development, then lets anyone who cares to make the gadget! We have enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;handouts now!</i><br>
<p>
Again, I think that inventors should sell their ideas, once, and then<br>
conclude the transaction.  Firms who try to negotiate a per-copy<br>
arrangement will have greater marginal costs than firms who don't have this<br>
arrangement, and thus won't be able to compete in a competitive market,<br>
whereas a firm which pays a sunk cost can recover that cost from the<br>
increase in demand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Again, if you need the coerced profits in the rectangle in order to stay</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;afloat, then maybe you should be rethinking the value of your product in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;general.  And as I think I have shown, you DO benefit from invention, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;when other people are allowed to compete with you for your products.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, you are confusing a limited supply with infinity! If there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;demand for X products, and the knock-off guy can make them for less than I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can, because I have 'sunk costs' to amortize, I am dead. The customers will</i><br>
<i>&gt;naturally buy his product and pass mine by - after all, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference if his quality matches mine! If he makes a cheap imitation, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;still may be dead if he succeeds in selling long enough for me to starve to</i><br>
<i>&gt;death, or if he poisons the market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I get no benefit from a given market if my costs prevent me from selling at</i><br>
<i>&gt;a profit. Period.</i><br>
<p>
You're not dead, you just make a smaller total profit than he does.  He<br>
gets to reap the whole trapezoid, you get the trapezoid minus the costs of<br>
invention.  However, (and this is my whole point,) that's still a positive<br>
number.<br>
