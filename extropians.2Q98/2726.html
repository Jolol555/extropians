heres a spin on privacy that i dont often see:suppose we wanted to form a system<br>
that intentionally ended<br>
privacy, for volunteers only.  one could sign up, pay a fee, get<br>
a magnetic chip implanted in or on one's person, that would<br>
allow the government or anyone else to know ones whereabouts<br>
and actions at any time.  this would apply only to those of us who<br>
are hard-line openness advocates.  it would carry medical records,<br>
for instance, financial information for use in purchasing, or for<br>
allowing advertising people to really know what i am interested<br>
in purchasing, etc.  i think i might sign up for something like that,<br>
just to show that for a subset of humanity, total openness is nothing<br>
to fear.  or perhaps i would learn that this is something to be feared?  spike<br>
