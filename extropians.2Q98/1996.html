Michael Lorrey and  Daniel Fabulich<br>
<p>
Gentlemen, you have been discussing IPR for some time now and<br>
are beginning to refine the discussoin somewhat. However, you<br>
still appear to be repating yourselves to some extent, and<br>
perhaps spending a little bit of time on rhetoric instead<br>
of discussion. Still, It's a good debate. At this point however,<br>
I'd really appreciate it if you could develop a brief consensus<br>
statement, describing what you agree on, what you disagree on,<br>
and the relevance to the future in general and to extropy in<br>
particular.<br>
<p>
It appears that you agree that:<br>
   --the IPR issue is important<br>
   --It's appropriate to discuss this in terms of private law<br>
     (PPA's, PPL's, and contracts<br>
   --There are IP enforcement costs<br>
   --there are IP enforcement benefits<br>
<p>
It appears that the crux if the disagreement is primarily in<br>
terms of the costs and benefits.<br>
<p>
There appears to be a secondary(?) disagreement on appropriate<br>
measurement.<br>
<p>
Perhaps you should each list your ideas of the costs and the benefits,<br>
First just name them, and then try to analyze them. I would be<br>
able to follow the debate more easily if you started with an<br>
agreed-upon list of disagreements before you continue the debate,<br>
but I realize I'm asking for a lot.<br>
<p>
Thanks.<br>
