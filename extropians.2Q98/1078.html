That is true here on Earth. What about beings evolved in the atmosphere of a<br>
gas giant? Or on a planet circling a brown dwarf? There might not be enough<br>
ambient radiation to make vision possible.<br>

I would expect that non-visually oriented intelligences would never develop<br>
astronomy, and so probably would never develop space travel, or get out to<br>
meet other races - but what if WE go to meet them? Would we ever be able to<br>
communicate? Would we be able to even see them as intelligent?<br>
