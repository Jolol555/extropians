         <br>
<p>
But it's much deeper than just a measurement problem because Heisenberg's  <br>
Uncertainty Principle is only a small part of Quantum Mechanics, and by the <br>
standards of that bizarre science a conventional part.  It's a little strange <br>
that there's a relationship between  position and momentum, and a limit on <br>
our knowledge of the product of both,  but it's not irrational. On the other <br>
hand there are some aspects of modern physics can only be described as crazy. <br>
Take the famous 2 slit experiment for example, shine a light on 2 closely <br>
spaced slits and it will produce a complex interference pattern on a film, <br>
even if the photons are sent out one at a time. If a photon goes through one <br>
slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the other slit, the one it didn't go <br>
though, was there or not, but it does.<br>
<p>
Even stranger, place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit, and  <br>
one set at  90 degrees over the other, the interference pattern disappears. <br>
Now place a third filter set at 45 degrees one inch in front of the film and  <br>
10 light years from the slits. The interference pattern comes back, even <br>
though you didn't decide to put the filter in front of the film until 10 years <br>
after the photons passed the slits! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does <br>
not enter in any of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and <br>
we just don't know which one, it must go through the left slit only, and the <br>
right slit only, and both slits, and no slit at all, and it must do all these <br>
things at the same time. Fundamental ambiguity in nature? Fundamental  <br>
ignorance of some new law of logic? Backward causality? Parallel universes?  <br>
None of the above? I have no idea. <br>
<p>
If this seems pretty stupid and completely ridiculous I don't blame you a bit, <br>
but I'm the wrong person to receive the  complaint, send it to God.<br>
