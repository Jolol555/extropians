<i>&gt; I missed the earlier post, so I'll respond to this here.  You have</i><br>

<i>&gt; and consequentialism may sometimes agree on the same moral actions, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are two VERY distinct moral theories; there is no way you could construe</i><br>
<i>&gt; one to be the other, despite the fact that they do have some overlap.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     I think that M and L intersect, but not by 100%,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     which is to say, as you've articulated, that not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     all things that can be defined as "me first" can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     be defined as libertarian. I think that L is either</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     equal to U or all of L is in U, such that no L is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     external to U (which I think we agree). I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     that L may be defined: "me-first + nonaggression."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would agree with most of this, however, not with the total concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nonagression. Personal Caveats vis a vis nonagression:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a) no first strike policy against those who espouse and practice the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; b) maintain a first strike policy against those who fall into a utilitarian or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; communitarian subset which has in the past demonstrated a high likelihood to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; practice first strike agression.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; c) maintain and practice skills and equipment for first strike preparedness, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the threat of instant retaliation seems to be the only deterrent which agressor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; type sets respect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You're going to maintain a first-strike policy against communitarians???</i><br>
<i>&gt; You realize that this entails going out there with a weapon, TODAY, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; killing as many non-libertarians as possible?  Besides the fact that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; plan will be totally ineffective, (we're outnumbered, millions to one,) it</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignores the possibility that these people could learn from their mistakes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; change their ways, and learn to coexist with their fellow human beings.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As much as I dislike communitarians, you won't ever see me killing</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody just for holding that belief.</i><br>
<p>
I never said I'd kill all of them. A First strike can range from a mild talking to,<br>
up to the agression you are insinuating.  Moreover, I was mainly thinking of it in<br>
terms of the policy I would have in a libertarian world, not the current one.<br>
