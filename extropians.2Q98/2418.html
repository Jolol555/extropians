<p>
  IAN: We agree on most things: that identity is <br>
  holistic and that the traditional Three Laws of <br>
  Thought are absurd and need holistic revision.<br>
<p>
  We're covering 2 issues, (1) What is identity?<br>
  and (2), What do people think atomism is? <br>
<p>
  Re: (1) What is identity?<br>
<p>
  As we agree, the old absurd Aristotelian identity <br>
  laws need to cite the holistic-identity structure <br>
  in which A is A only relative to -A. As such, 1 <br>
  is 1, not due to its relation to itself, but 1 <br>
  is 1 fundamentally due to its relation to 0.<br>
<p>
  Toward holistic revision, you have suggested <br>
  that "with respect to 0" be added to the Three<br>
  Laws of Thought in accord with zero mechanics.<br>
<p>
  Having established that 1 is the 0/1 relation,<br>
  we have 1, we've "achieved" identity, and this <br>
  0/1 relation is a holism, it is a whole set with <br>
  subsets, or subfeatures dependent upon the whole. <br>
<p>
  An issue we disagree on is does the addition of <br>
  other identities relating to 0 into our universe <br>
  of discourse change the identity of the first <br>
  0/1 relation that we had. You say no, I say yes.<br>
<p>
  Our universe of discourse (U) contains the 0/1 relation:<br>
<p>
	   0/1<br>
<p>
  Now we add several more relations, none same as 0/1:<br>
<p>
	   0/1   0/9<br>
	   0/6   0/4<br>
<p>
  In the first case, 0/1 was 100% of U, now the 0/1 <br>
  relation is only one-fourth of U, now it *is* LESS <br>
  relative to the whole. We can now also say that the <br>
  0/1 relation is unique. When we say A is _____(fill <br>
  in the blank), what it is is an attribute of its <br>
  identity, and as we can see, adding new relations<br>
  to U has added new identity attributes to 0/1,<br>
  and as such, identity is a holistic function.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Why Holism is Absolute<br>
<p>
  100% holism always wins, for even if we disagree <br>
  with the above and instead believe that the 0/1 <br>
  relation has NOT changed, then this identified <br>
  state of "not-change" (not-C) is "not-C" relative, <br>
  and only relative, to C, and thus the non-changing <br>
  of the initial 0/1 relation is a measure of holism.<br>
  The change here being that of the contents of U.<br>
<p>
  So the examples of the relations of relations <br>
  cited have not identified any variety of free<br>
  identity, and as such we always have 100% holism.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Re: (2) What do people think atomism is?<br>
<p>
  I say that the traditional Three Laws of Thought <br>
  define atomism by 100% by declaring that what the<br>
  identity of A is excludes -A, and that the theory <br>
  of atomism is different than holism. You feel that <br>
  atomism = holism and an improved version of the 3<br>
  Laws of Thought based upon holism defines atomism.<br>
<p>
  If, as you stated, nobody believes the Three Laws <br>
  of Thought as they've been written for centuries, <br>
  that's fine with me. If there is nothing exterior <br>
  to holism, as you also seem to agree on, that too<br>
  is fine with me. But I still believe that atomist<br>
  identity theory is different than holist identity<br>
  theory, but I'm willing to agree to disagree.<br>
<p>
