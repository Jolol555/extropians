<p>
Indeed.  But the ways in which people have come to terms with death are<br>
perhaps even more personal.  Suggesting that death can be long deferred<br>
threatens the core of many people's being, inspiring fierce opposition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But death will not go away - unless we make it go away.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; For the first time since single-cell life coalesced on this planet, we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps within reach of doing just that.</i><br>
<p>
Death will not go away.  The current causes of death will be replaced by<br>
other causes.  But dramatically increased lifespans are indeed cause for joy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But solving death, and life, is not a merely technical project.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It embraces everything that makes us human.  The first immortal generation</i><br>
<i>&gt; will not be the children of just science alone, but of law, art, music,</i><br>
<i>&gt; writing - all the humane arts.</i><br>
<p>
A vivid example of this is cryonics.  A technology which has a good chance of<br>
lengthing the lives of most people who now "die" by orders of magnitudes is <br>
taken up by only a few hundred.  What makes those people different is mainly <br>
their "humanity".  Yes, these people tend to know science better than average,<br>
but millions of others know science much better.  The few hundred cryonics <br>
customers, in contrast, seem to have taken the science seriously enough to <br>
let it join with their soul.  They love life strongly enough to face their<br>
deepest fears head on.<br>
