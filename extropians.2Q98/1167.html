From: Ian Goddard &lt;igoddard@erols.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;   Truth simply is the physical</i><br>
reality, true<br>
<i>&gt;   knowledge is  knowledge that has a</i><br>
one-one<br>
<i>&gt;   relation with the physical reality.</i><br>
To say<br>
<i>&gt;   X is true is to say that X exists or</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;   it models existence accurately.</i><br>
Science<br>
<i>&gt;   is about truth because it is about</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;   physical universe and learning its</i><br>
<i>&gt;   laws, principles, and structure.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Okay, now we have:<br>
<p>
Truth = Physical Reality<br>
<p>
So, if you seek the ultimate truth, that<br>
equates to: you seek the physical<br>
reality. But since /you/ constitute part<br>
of the physical reality, knowing<br>
yourself equals knowing the truth.<br>
Consequently, knowing the truth<br>
correlates to knowing yourself.<br>
Furthermore, "the truth will make you<br>
free" parallels "you will make you free"<br>
or "physical reality will make you<br>
free." Well, no one has called me "free"<br>
lately, but I like to think of myself as<br>
/reasonable/, if not really inexpensive.<br>
