I saw Jim Halperin (The Truth Machine, The First Immortal) speak and he made<br>
this same point.  He seemed to say in The Truth Machine that terrorists and<br>
criminals will have increasingly destructive weapons available to them and<br>
it won't be long before we will be practically forced to create some means<br>
of identifying the crazies (e.g. an infallible truth machine).  He thinks<br>
the price we will have to pay in terms of loss of privacy is the tradeoff we<br>
will have to make.<br>
