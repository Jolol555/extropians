[A long description of AIs vs Augumented humans]<br>
<p>
I think you are making some unsupported assumptions:<br>
   -- you asusme that AIs are separate entities.<br>
   -- you assume that augmented humans are separate entities.<br>
   -- you assume a polarization between humans and AIs<br>
<p>
I quit using the term AI some time ago, during an earlier round<br>
of this discussion in 1996. I prefer the term "superintelligence",<br>
or SI. IMO an SI will very likely start as an augmented human,<br>
a collaboration between one human and a computer. This SI can<br>
rapidly augment the computer part of itself, so there is no<br>
reason to assume that a second SI will come into existence prior<br>
to the first SI taking over the world, or that a de novo AI will<br>
ever come into existence. The SI may choose to decouple from its<br>
human component, but such a decision, and indeed any decision made<br>
by the SI, is beyond analysis by humans.<br>
<p>
There are variants on this scenario, such as a multi-human initial<br>
collaboration, but IMO a single human suffices. Further, there<br>
is no real necessity for new I/O interfaces: mouse and monitor suffice.<br>
Since the human can provide creative direction and strategic pattern<br>
matching, the computer need not start at "human level". This means<br>
that the SI may be achievable at today's level of hardware, and that<br>
the only reason the SI does not already exist is that the software<br>
has not yet all been invented. If this is the case, the SI will<br>
come into existence suddenly, as a phase change rather than as a<br>
mere rapid increase in development. Please see:<br>
