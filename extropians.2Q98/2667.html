Interesting meme...that people are sooooooo terrified that life has no<br>
"meaning"...that there has to be someone "responsible"...<br>
<p>
Lots of tag words.  God, evil, meaning, good...responsibible...heaven,<br>
hell...beleiver...infidel...apostacy...heretic...blaspheme....yapata yapata...<br>
<p>
You hear yammering about relegious freedom?  In reality they want freedom to<br>
persecute others while not being persecuted themselves.  The history of<br>
relegion is rife with bloodshed...one relegious group against others.<br>
<p>
In the past I've heard the phrase..."Freedom OF relegion..but not freedom FROM<br>
relegion'...referring to the constitution or somthing.  Disgusting thought.  <br>
<p>
In reality nature IS...and doesn't much give a hoot one way or another. We can<br>
sit in our sand pile and paint our bellies blue and bow and scrape to made up<br>
gods...or not.  If we make it fine...if not...well how many million species<br>
are we aware of that went extinct?  Does nature   care? Of course not...the<br>
very concept of "caring" and "nature" is an anthropomorphism....and incorrect.<br>
