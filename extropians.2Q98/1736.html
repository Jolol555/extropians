<i>&gt; If my principle is utility first and I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; a hypothesis about what nature is, then I do</i><br>
<i>&gt; research, gathering data about nature, add </i><br>
<i>&gt; it all up, and lo and behold the numbers </i><br>
<i>&gt; suggest my hypothesis is not true, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; have one of two options:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) conclude that my hypothesis is not true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) alter the data to make my theory appear true</i><br>
<p>
Most of you seem to take for granted the equation science=truth, <br>
which is a bit naive considering the fact that absolute scientific <br>
facts change on a frequent basis.<br>
No actual/physical alteration of data is necessary to achieve a <br>
scientific situation which is only arguably true.<br>
Consider Dark Matter. It is fairly reasonable to consider Dark Matter <br>
as a concept thought of only to resolve certain conflicts between old <br>
theories and recent calculations. As a matter of fact, there is no <br>
justification nor evidence of the existence of such a thing, apart <br>
from the fact that it allows existing scientific theories to stand. I <br>
wonder, isn't it more 'truthful', at least on the level of <br>
intellectual integrity, to cancel the old theories once they have <br>
been rebutted rather than inventing a new factor that makes them <br>
legitimate? I mean, this kind of behavior is practically religious.<br>
