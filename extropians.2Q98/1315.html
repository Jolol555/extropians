<i>&gt; &gt;Copyrights do nothing but reward duplication and mediocrity at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the expense of true creativity and artistry.  Patents do nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;but reward pointless novelty at the expense of workmanship and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;quality.  Writers and inventors should not be afraid of losing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their jobs to their abolition--they should cheer for losing their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;jobs, and being freed to use their talents more profitably in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a thousand other ways that the laws have stifled for too long.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here I have a problem. How exactly doesw my having a copyright or patent</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent you from developing your own unique copyrightable or patentable</i><br>
<i>&gt; product? These laws have no effect on creativity, except possibly in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; area of discovering ways to make a patented thing faster or better than </i><br>
<i>&gt; the patent owner can..</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't prevent me from developing my own /unique/ creations,<br>
where "unique" is defined as "sufficiently different and unobvious<br>
to merit copyright or patent under the present system".  What it<br>
prevents is I and others making small incremental improvements or<br>
customizations to creative works.  I can't build a Dodge Neon with<br>
a little better stereo; I can't produce a good German translation<br>
of a book I like, even if I'd do a much better job than whoever<br>
the author chooses to hire--if he hires anyone at all.  I can't<br>
make a braille edition of a magazine without negotiating with the<br>
copyright holder.  I can't make a college textbook with extensive<br>
excerpts from classic novels (only short "fair use" excerpts).<br>
I can't make wallpaper based on a popular piece of art.<br>
<p>
Copyrights is based on the myth of the lone inventor--the idea<br>
that creative works spring full-born from the mind of a single<br>
creator.  In reality, there is no such thing as "creation" from<br>
nothing.  All inventors and authors draw from a pool of public<br>
domain ideas and recombine and modify them in interesting ways.<br>
With copyright law, only those modifications that pass an arbitrary<br>
bar of "uniqueness" are able to get to market, regardless of their<br>
inherent value.  Small, incremental improvements to things--which<br>
would be the majority of works without copyright--aren't made,<br>
which results in a decline of both quality and quanitity of work.<br>
When all creators are free to do those small things they do best<br>
without lawyers in the way, really great works can be created. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even so, the free market will evolve protections analogous to</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents and trademarks. It is inevitable that rules of some sort</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be made to prevent theft and fraud.</i><br>
<p>
Some creators will go to great lengths to use encryption and<br>
contracts and other means to guard their works--and they will<br>
suffer for it.  That's their problem.  As long as they do it in<br>
the free market, let them.  Also, I have no problem with laws<br>
against actual fraud--for example, producing a work by someone<br>
else and claiming it is yours.  I suspect, though, that what you<br>
are calling "theft" here is merely the use of others' ideas, and<br>
that is only "theft" by definition, not reality.  Copyright law<br>
is what mistakenly attributes the concept of "property" to ideas<br>
that are no such thing, and I reject such argument-by-definition<br>
as meaningless.<br>
