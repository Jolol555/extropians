Some otherwise rational scientists have extreme problems with even<br>
considering certain topics. Isaac Asimov wrote wonderful science fiction and<br>
as a scientist dismissed out of hand many ideas that did not match the<br>
current state of knowledge in physics. 'Impossible!' was the title of one<br>
essay - and he meant it!<br>
<p>
It is fine to say 'under our current level of knowledge, this process is<br>
impossible' - the qualifier allows you to gracefully accept the impossible<br>
when someone discovers the way to do it. Psi is one thing that has had tons<br>
of bad press, and bad sci-fi, so many scientists shy away.<br>
<p>
There has to be room for 'silly science' research. Most of it will be found<br>
to be horsefeathers, I am afraid, but there will be an occasional gem that<br>
should more than pay the costs of supporting research on dead ends. Besides,<br>
this research will keep some of the crackpots from entering politics or<br>
becoming Presidential advisers..<br>
