<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; times" which have long been foretold.  His Y2K site is largely secular,</i><br>

You know this could be rather funny. You could look at it like those people whose<br>
technology is outmoded such that they do not fix their Y2K problems will die a<br>
horrible death economically as their livlihoods are destroyed. Thus those people<br>
with non Y2K compliant software and hardware are marked with 'the number of the<br>
beast'  he he he..... thus the chosen people of GOD are the extropic digerati of<br>
the world, and the old ignorant people and bureaucracies are the minions of the<br>
devil... he he....   If things are bad with the US's IRS, how bad are they for<br>
computer systems in countries like India, China, and Russia???  ....<br>
<p>
Those that get the Y2K fix will experience 1000 years of computing Heaven on<br>
Earth, those that don't will burn in the pits of ignorance....<br>
<p>
Hmmmmm, sounds like a marketing campaign......<br>
