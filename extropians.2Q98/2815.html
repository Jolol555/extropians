&lt;&lt; Well, if you look up the definition of "beautiful" in a dictionary and<br>
learn <br>
 it's something that has beauty you won't be much the wiser, but it's really <br>
 irrelevant because in my original comments I never said anything about <br>
 definitions. People rarely have definitions for the concepts they use every<br>
 day and rarely need them. Nearly all our knowledge, and all the really <br>
 important stuff, comes to us by way of example not definition.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Two things.  <br>
<p>
First, In your original comments you said that if something is more<br>
fundamental than information we will never understand it.  I replied that<br>
because X allows definitions to exist does not mean that X cannot be defined.<br>
To tie this back in with your original comment, the fact that X makes<br>
information possible does not mean that we can't understand X (assuming that<br>
what we can define we can understand).  So it's quite relevant to your<br>
original comment.  <br>
<p>
Second, it's true that people don't require much knowledge at all as they go<br>
about their daily tasks.  We could get along quite well with a series of true<br>
beliefs (acquired, luckily, through false methods) or simply with a series of<br>
beliefs that are practical in the sense that we can use them to manipulate the<br>
world but false in the sense that they don't accurately represent the world.<br>
For those interested in acquiring knowledge, however, the definitions of<br>
concepts are extremely relevant.  To reply to your example regarding beauty,<br>
while I agree that a dictionary definition might not prove very illuminating,<br>
a philosophical discussion aimed at creating and refining a definition might<br>
prove extremely illuminating.<br>
                <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;          &gt;Is information fundamental?  That's the kind of question to be   <br>
<i>         &gt;resolved by the parent of all empirical sciences, philosophy</i><br>
                   <br>
 <br>
 I think Astronomy is the parent of all Science, philosophers have been big on<br>
 theory but notoriously poor at empirical science, Aristotle was a complete <br>
 embarrassment as a scientist.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
As each branch of philosophy became successful and expanded it broke off, in a<br>
sense.  A fairly recent example is psychology.  The fact that when science was<br>
a part of philosophy it was still in its infancy and thus quite poor has<br>
nothing to do with the fact that it sprang from philosophy.  And indeed, I<br>
would venture to say that science is STILL part of philosophy, that neither<br>
can really exist or flourish without the other.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; And I still maintain we'll never discover <br>
 anything more fundamental than information, you'll never prove that you and I<br>
 and the entire visible universe aren't just a software program running on a <br>
 hyper computer somewhere. I'm not saying that's what's happening, I'm saying <br>
 it could be and we'd never know. Besides, even a hyper computer can't operate<br>
 without information.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The principle that we'll never discover anything more fundamental than<br>
information is only true if everything IS information.  I think that it is<br>
more accurate to say that everything could PROVIDE information, while not<br>
everything IS information.  When we ask for information, we really want the<br>
FACTS; we could, if possible and necessary, do without the symbols and such by<br>
means of which we transmit those facts.<br>
As far as skeptical challenges go, like the one you mentioned although I<br>
confess that I've never heard of it, I think that they can be explained away. <br>
