Yes, you are right Damien.  I had some discussion with Dan privately and he is<br>
very polite and diplomatic.  I went off a little half-cocked and apologized to<br>
him accordingly.<br>
<p>
Over the discourse of the last couple of weeks, some have 'gone off' on me<br>
without reading a single thing I wrote - and in turn putting words in my mouth I<br>
never said.  After a couple of weeks of constantly defending and RE-explaining<br>
myself, it can get very frustrating hearing certain people trashing my posts for<br>
no other reason than what appears to be I am not one of the "in" crowd with<br>
appropriatly phrased "catch-words" spouting some particular "party-line".  I<br>
apologize if I got a little overly defensive in this regard.  Like most everyone<br>
here, I very much want to engage in healthy discourse and debate on issues that<br>
interest all of us - increasing extropy.<br>
