<i>&gt; I don't understand what you mean when you say that your costs must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; recovered before you make a profit.  You cover costs BY making a profit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's the whole point.  :)</i><br>
<p>
I think you're confusing revenues with profit.<br>
<p>
Revenues is every dime of income from sales or rental of goods, <br>
services, or capital.<br>
<p>
Profit is what is left of revenues after you pay all costs.<br>
<p>
So you cannot cover a cost by making a profit.<br>
<p>
You have to cover *all* costs before you make *any* profit.<br>
<p>
There are various *categories* of profits, categorized by specifying <br>
what costs are already paid and what aren't.<br>
<p>
For example, suppose that you pay all your sunk costs with borrowed <br>
money.  You could have an "operating profit" which is your day-to-day <br>
income minus your day-to-day operating expenses.  But when you are <br>
looking at "operating profit", you still have not made any payment on <br>
all that money you borrowed, and you still have not paid your <br>
business income taxes.<br>
<p>
If your "operating profit" is not sufficient to make the payments on <br>
the loan, your business is in serious trouble.<br>
<p>
You also haven't paid depreciation.  If you have a million-dollar <br>
piece of equipment which is going to be worn out after ten years, you <br>
had best be setting aside enough for depreciation that, when the ten <br>
years are up, you can go buy another one: very roughly $100,000 per <br>
year.  If you fail to set aside a depreciation allowance long enough, <br>
a critical piece of equipment will wear out and you won't have the <br>
money to replace it.  your business will die.  This is important <br>
enough that even the US Internal Revenue Service allows companies to <br>
set aside money in a depreciation fund and consider it a business <br>
expense.<br>
