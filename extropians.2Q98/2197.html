        Thank you, Damien.<br>
        <br>

        What I find so hard to explain is why anyone should have problems <br>
        with what is essentially a profoundly _uncomplicated_ physics:<br>
        <br>
      [1] Classical Mechanics (the foundation of physics):<br>
     <br>
      [2] Faradayan Electric and Magnetic and Gravitational Forces <br>
        propagated with time delays (as Leigh Page showed [1912] and <br>
        [1914] these reduce to Maxwell's equations relative to the <br>
        force-emitting bodies).<br>
<p>
      [3]  A Ballistic Theory of Light whereby photons-with-mass are <br>
        emitted at 'c' relative to the emitting body.<br>
<p>
<p>
      My basic claim is that -- if you do a little bit of work -- you can <br>
      deal with any physics problem above the nuclear scale (we're working <br>
      on extending it into the nuclear realm).  Everything becomes so much <br>
      more straight-forward, and -- on a balance-sheet basis -- the gains <br>
      vastly exceed the losses.  In addition, there are are no 'six <br>
      impossible things before breakfast' to believe.<br>
      <br>
      The whole thing can be laid out on a single sheet of A4 paper.<br>
<p>
      And it can be easily simulated on a computer.  The program does not <br>
      break down with paradoxes and contradictions.  It's my guess we have <br>
      this program directly encoded into our brain at a tacit level.<br>
      <br>
  <br>
      There's a wonderful sense of clarity and intellectual power.<br>
<p>
<p>
      And there's a _political_ edge to all this  -- particle theories are <br>
      favoured by individualists, whilst wave theories are preferred by <br>
      collectivists (Cf: Danah Zohar, 'The Quantum Self.').<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Regards,<br>
      <br>
