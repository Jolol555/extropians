<i> &gt; Hey guys &amp; gals:</i><br>

<i> &gt; Want to let these spammers know how much you *really* like learning about</i><br>
<i> &gt; how to freeze your bat?  They have a message board at: </i><br>

<i> &gt; You can also post a complaint to UU.NET via spam-complaint@uu.net or</i><br>
<i> &gt; fraud@uu.net.  Mr. John Bradshaw (bradshaw@UU.NET - head of the dept.)</i><br>
<i> &gt; claims they are putting an end to spam on UU.NET.  You can also post your</i><br>

Btw, you might be interested in what Sanford W. recently said:<br>

<p>
Have acts of physical violence against spammers and their businesses<br>
ever been reported? As emails are no evidence in court, and legal<br>
action can be delayed virtually indefinitely, termination of spammers<br>
in physical space (Achille's heel at least of the nonvirtual<br>
merchandize) should be a natural autoregulation mechanism. It a)<br>
provides low-latency effective deterrence b) remove individuals <br>
from the (small) foolhardy-spammer pool (albeit by small increments). <br>
<p>
Of course relying on naturally occuring Holy Avenger fruitcakes<br>
is somewhat difficult the lack of their abundance considered, so can <br>
there be an effective mechanism to funnel resources of irate targets <br>
into spammer termination? Future crypto infrastructure may provide an <br>
anonymous digicash user-to-avenger nexus, allowing interactive resource<br>
allocation to known spammers (authenticadedly indentified, to protect <br>
against turning lilly-white users for spammers). This provides a<br>
nice positive autofeedback loop between number of spam hits and the <br>
head money allocated to termination of the offender -- to the effect<br>
that the most pressing problems get removed first.<br>
<p>
Wouldn't we all sometimes gladly pay $5 just for a short snuff video snippet?<br>
<p>
ha-ha only serious,<br>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. Of course above scheme is also applicable to other unpopular<br>
     public figures, which will probably mean it to be difficult to <br>
     implement.<br>
