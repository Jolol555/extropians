Got it.  Thanks.<br>
<p>
Has anyone looked at the results poll?  The majority wants to be around in<br>
2200, yet only a minority would be cryonically frozen after death even<br>
if financing it wasn't an issue.  What other option is there to live to<br>
the year 2200 *after you've died*???  Maybe the public just needs to be<br>
better educated... when's Halperin's miniseries going to be aired?<br>
<p>
Also interesting is that all the names I saw were extropians: Robin<br>
Hanson, Ralph Merckle, and Kennita Watson.  These people were classified<br>
as "nerds."  Is that a fair classification?   From just reading the<br>
contributions of these 3 extropians, "nerd" is not a word that pops into<br>
my mind.  I always think of a nerd as someone who spends their time<br>
exercising their mind at the expense of their body-- a pretty unextropian<br>
thing to do if you ask me... hardly a good path to physical immortality.  <br>
<p>
I remember Anders Sandberg classifying himself as a nerd.  Why was that?<br>
<p>
Another point mentioned by the writer is that of the 26 people he found<br>
signed up for cryonics, only 1 was female... is that a representative<br>
figure? Does anyone have Alcor stats to support this gender gap?<br>
<p>
A recommend extropians take the poll and skew their results-- maybe that<br>
will alter the tone of articles like this one, where cryonicists and<br>
physical immortalists are treated as a bizarre and insignificant fringe,<br>
and good fodder for silly jokes about a post-apocalyptic Planet of the<br>
Nerds.<br>
