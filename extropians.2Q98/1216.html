I, too, have a deep love for the power company. Years back, I operated a<br>
body shop I bought as a going concern from the founder. I transferred<br>
electricity and gas utilities to my name, and paid the bills on time.<br>
<p>
Almost a year later, Communist Edison sent me a letter demanding a $1000<br>
deposit because I was a 'new business'. I asked the person at the office<br>
what would happen if I refused to give them the money. They said they would<br>
cut off my power.<br>
<p>
I told them to go ahead - I did not need them! I installed a 75 kW three<br>
phase alternator driven by a Toyota 3RC engine, burning natural gas. Two<br>
days later I was up and running my own 'utility'. In the six months I did<br>
this, I estimated I saved about 20% on what I would have spent for their<br>
power, including maintainance on the generator. In the cold months, I also<br>
used the waste heat for reducing demand on the space heaters.<br>
<p>
I called them up and requested to be hooked up again after learning that the<br>
gas cost was going to double. CE had me back on line in a day, and did not<br>
ask for a deposit - it seemed that I was now an 'established business' and<br>
therefore trustworthy.<br>
<p>
I guess the original desksitters had moved on by that time, or they have a<br>
really short corporate memory..<br>
