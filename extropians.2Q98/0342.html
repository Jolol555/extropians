So there's this lo-o-ong table set up in a conference room at the Garden<br>
Court Hotel in Plow Alto and arrayed along it are (amongst others) Jamie<br>
Zawinski (the guy who footed the bill for the Mozilla Dot Party last<br>
week) and Tom Paquin of Mozilla.org, Paul Vixie, the developer of BIND,<br>
Brian Behlendorf, one of the developers of Apache, Eric Allman, the guy<br>
behind sendmail, Larry Wall, the benevolent god of Perl, Guido van<br>
Rossum, the somewhat-less-benevolent demigod of Python, John Gilmore,<br>
founder of (among other things) the alt.* newsgroup hierarchy, the EFF,<br>
The Little Garden and Cygnus Solutions, Phil Zimmermann (with a magic<br>
markered-in second "n" on his nameplate), John Ousterhout, the man who<br>
created Tcl and Tk, Eric Raymond, author of "The Cathedral and the <br>
Bazaar", the white paper that was intrumental in convincing Netscape to<br>
release its source code, Linus Torvalds and other luminaries, all gathered<br>
around Tim O'Reilly, who's acting as ringmaster for the collection of<br>
computer industry trade journal wankers in suits who've been invited to<br>
question these luminaries at the end of the first-ever Freeware Summit.<br>
<p>
And what, you might wonder, did these business-suited nitwits clamor to<br>
ask this jaw-dropping conglomeration of brainiacs?<br>
<p>
"So, how do you expect to make any money, if you give your software away<br>
for free?"<br>
<p>
"No, really--how do you expect to make money?"<br>
<p>
"Uh--how are you going to convince IS managers to take you seriously, if<br>
you give your software away?"<br>
<p>
"I mean it--why should they take you seriously?  You're not IBM or DEC<br>
or Oracle, after all."<br>
<p>
"How do you expect to compete against Microsoft?"<br>
<p>
"Seriously, how are you going to compete against Microsoft?"<br>
<p>
"No, but listen--how are you going to compete against Microsoft?"<br>
<p>
This crap went on for almost 90 minutes (I have most of it on audio tape,<br>
if anyone's interested).  It's a damned good thing I don't carry firearms<br>
to these things, or InfoWorld, et al, would have help-wanted signs out<br>
right now.<br>
<p>
At least there was a nice opportunity to go one-on-one with the good guys<br>
after the formal press conference broke up.  I found out that Larry Wall<br>
is planning on getting Perl 5.1 out the door by August, and that it will<br>
include stable multithreading, Unicode support and other goodies.  I also<br>
found out that Linus runs Red Hat on his own desktop.  And that Paul <br>
Vixie is even more paranoid than Zach--and is certain that SAIC is behind<br>
the so-called Green Paper on the New Domain Order.<br>
<p>
Other interesting stuff happened, too, but I'm very tired now, so I'm<br>
going to bed..<br>
<p>
