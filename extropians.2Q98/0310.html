<i>&gt; From:          "Lee Daniel Crocker" &lt;lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net (none)&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Horatio Alger may be fiction</i><br>
<p>
No, Horatio Alger was extremely real.  He was an author.<br>
<p>
The funny thing is, Horatio Alger wrote no "Horatio Alger stories".<br>
<p>
The classic Horatio Alger story is like the guys I mentioned: young <br>
man gets rich through hard work.<br>
<p>
The actual stuff Horatio Alger wrote was more a socialist's parody of <br>
that: young man gets rich through marrying the boss's daughter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and success may have as much to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do with luck as with hard work (honest capitalists never claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise), but it clear can and does happen.</i><br>
<p>
Many honest capitalists also point out that you shouldn't give luck <br>
only one chance to happen to you.  There are any number of rich <br>
people who will tell you they started on a shoestring -- and the <br>
shoestring broke.  So they worked as employees for a few years and <br>
saved up enough money to buy another shoestring.  And maybe the third <br>
or fourth shoestring actually held up long enough to get rich off of.<br>
<p>
What?  With the socialists claiming that under capitalism an employee <br>
can't save enough in a lifetime to become a business owner, I'm <br>
claiming that under capitalism an employee can do so IN A FEW YEARS?<br>
<p>
Yep.  Absolutely.  <br>
<p>
My own father did so at least three times between <br>
1960 and 1974.  (Unfortunately he was a lousy businessman, and never <br>
managed to make the shoestring hold up; basically both his business <br>
and the family he was raising had to live off his savings.)<br>
