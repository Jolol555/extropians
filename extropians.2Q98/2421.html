<i>&gt; I am not one for defending Christianity</i><br>

me neither<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Testament seems to indicate that Jesus kept denying his divinity and kept</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling his followers to stop treating him any differently than any other</i><br>
<i>&gt; human.  I believe that his followers are the ones who diefied him, as with</i><br>
<i>&gt; many great men.  The legend took on a life of its own, and has little</i><br>
<i>&gt; relation to the actual history.</i><br>
<p>
Let me add to this that we have the distortions of one Saul of Tarsus, who was <br>
not only a woman-hater but also a self-aggrandizing Jesus-hater; who was <br>
called to account by Jesus' appointed apostles on at least two separate <br>
occasions during his lifetime -- *after* his alleged conversion -- for <br>
misrepresenting the teachings of Jesus, and is suspected on credible evidence <br>
of having attempted to murder the titular head of the Jesusite sect, Jesus' <br>
brother James, on one of these occasions.<br>
<p>
And that the New Testament we have today can be neatly divided into two parts:<br>
<p>
 (1) the words of Saul and his followers, and<br>
 (2) one Gospel -- Mark if I remember correctly, but don't quote me -- and the <br>
book of Acts.<br>
<p>
Further, there was a synod during the reign of a Justinian in the eastern empire, <br>
a rather embarrassing thing in that a grand total of six bishops attended who <br>
weren't *politically* dependent on Justinian, and most votes ended up with six <br>
bishops on one side and the rest on the other.  Prior to this synod, a certain <br>
early Christian theologian by the name of Origen was very highly regarded by <br>
most priests and bishops, including quite a few who were later named saints; <br>
afterward, his teachings and his very name were blasphemy, and anything <br>
resembling them was to be stricken from the church's teachings -- and through <br>
various machinations these teachings were quite thoroughly stricken, including <br>
when re-copying the writings of the various founders (none of which had the <br>
status of "Holy Scripture" at that time or for another couple hundred years).<br>
<p>
This synod, incidentally, was part of the beginning of the schism between the <br>
Roman church and the Orthodox church -- but both sides accepted its edicts.<br>
<p>
(What I learned about the history of the Christian faith got me expelled from a <br>
church before I was a teenager - and later persuaded me that a person who <br>
truly and honestly followed the teachings of Jesus would find no spiritual home <br>
in that religion, with the multiply-debatable exception of the Unitarians.  And <br>
this was before I turned away from strict monotheism...)<br>
