<i>&gt;&gt;   ExI holds regular meetings, and therefore per-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   forms "rituals." Why bother with such strained</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   argumentation to achieve an insult? Just argue</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   over the philosophical principles.  The insult</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   thing is just an ad hominem variety of counter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You should separate the "cult" discussion from the "principles" discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;As I've already written in a private mail to Anders, I am a very lingual</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinker and prefer to use the correct words. And I still think that the word</i><br>
<i>&gt;"cult" applies to the ExI. It doesn't have anything to do with whether the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ExI is positive or negative, it just means using the right terms to describe</i><br>
<i>&gt;things.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I addressed that before: it seems to me that <br>
  your implying that your defining of ExI as a "cult"<br>
  is simply an objective linguistic analysis, no harm<br>
  or insult intended, but then you attempt to imply<br>
  "Scientology" and "ExI" are same thing since you <br>
  have defined both as "cult," even as you admit that <br>
  the two are not the same thing. In short, why not <br>
  just say: "I hate ExI and I'm going to attempt to <br>
  fit it into any demeaning category that I can" ?<br>
<p>
  If it can be so fit, then it is properly fit, but <br>
  I think ExI fits into "cult" only after considerable<br>
  stretching, so much so that the term "cult" is nulled.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;   BTW, your comments on the "optimism" post were</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   very enlightening and wise.  My revolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   style is exactly what I've felt is reckless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   But I have trouble breaking out of it. Full</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   frontal attacks on a cover-up may in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   only make it dig its heels in deeper.??</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have followed your analysis of the TWA-800 cover-up and forwarded it to my</i><br>
<i>&gt;friends. It was certainly interesting, but on the other hand, you have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ask yourself what you can achieve with this kind of information? Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have to understand power structures -- but although I have much</i><br>
<i>&gt;information about the JFK "incident", I will not try to convince anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the CIA are a bunch of killers, liars and generally evil guys. How</i><br>
<i>&gt;could that possibly help anyone?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: If they are killers, why should they <br>
   not be defined as such? How is defining a <br>
   killer not as a killer going to help anyone?<br>
   I think such would only ensure future killing.<br>
<p>
   You may follow up by saying, "If ExI is a <br>
   cult, why should it not be defined as a <br>
   cult?" To which I would reply that the <br>
   application of that definition to ExI is <br>
   strained at best, and as such serves no <br>
   useful function except to the extent that<br>
   it facilitates the application of an insult.<br>
<p>
   Your objections over the principles may or <br>
   may not be valid, but it seems to me that <br>
   this foray into "cultism" is tangential.<br>
