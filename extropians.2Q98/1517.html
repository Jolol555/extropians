The first genetic marker has been found for a gene that has a weak but <br>
statistically real effect on IQ. Robert Plomin of the London Institute Of  <br>
Psychiatry reported the results of his 5 year study in the May 1998 issue of  <br>
the journal "Psychological Science". Plomin studied the genes of 204 children, <br>
none were retarded and 51 of the kids had an IQ of 160 or higher. He found<br>
there was a relationship between high IQ and a marker on chromosome 6 called <br>
IGF2R. Plomin said that there must be a gene very close to this marker on <br>
the DNA and it would account for 2% of the variation in IQ found in the <br>
population. Having this gene would be worth about 4 IQ points to you. <br>
Plomin noted the extremely rapid rate new genes are being discovered and<br>
expressed confidence that more discoveries of this sort that deal with <br>
complex traits will be made in the near future.<br>
