There will always be a market for viable-seed plants from home gardeners.<br>
Reseeding plants can save a lot of time, and they also tend to do much<br>
better than the first year's crop (especially with flowers such as<br>
poppies) I assume this is because only the plants that are suited to one's<br>
environmental conditions will go to seed, making the following year's crop<br>
more consisently healthy.<br>
<p>
If TT seeds companies ever start using their market share for the "powers<br>
of evil", the companies that cater to home gardeners can enter the farming<br>
business and make a killing.<br>
<p>
If anyone is worried that even home gardeners will all switch to TT,<br>
someone should make a "seed-bank" with frozen seeds for all the major<br>
species of plants.  In the event that viable-seed plants for certain<br>
species are completely eliminated by disuse, someone can unfreeze some<br>
seeds and enter the market.<br>
<p>
I have a feeling this is done for endangered plants, except that instead<br>
of freezing the plants are grown in a large endangered-plant farm.  I<br>
think this is an important initiative: just compare the number of types of<br>
apple (probably around 100), to the number of types that exist at your<br>
local grocery (probably no more than 4).  The other apples are not getting<br>
used since they don't keep as well-- if they were not grown they would<br>
disappear forever, which would be a very silly mistake.  How hard do you<br>
think it would be to sell a bunch of health-conscious, enviro-friendly,<br>
trendy yuppies some short-keeping specialty apples?  It would be tragic to<br>
miss a business opportunity like that because no one though to freeze a<br>
few seeds.<br>
