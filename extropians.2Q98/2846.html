I reccommed that you read "the Transparent Society" (1998), by david Brin. Actually,<br>
you may prefer to read "Earth"(1990), also by Brin, instead, since it's a science<br>
fiction book that incorporates ideas from the other scolarly work.<br>
<p>
Basically, Brin states the obvious: the technology of surviellence is advancing<br>
exponentially, and we can't stop it. This means that government, and just about<br>
anybody else with enough money, can find out just about anything they want to<br>
about what an individual does in public. Brin's solution to the problem is<br>
simply to agree that all actions in public places are public, and give access<br>
to the scanners to anybody at all who wants it.<br>
<p>
By now, you are probably objecting to this violently as a gross invasion of privacy.<br>
I don't like the consequences either, but I agree with the premise and I cannot<br>
think of a viable alternative that is better. How do you propose to stop an<br>
observer, government or private? by force of law? How? do you propose to make it<br>
illegal for me to hook up a web camera in my car that runs continuously? or carry<br>
a web camera with me all the time? remember, I'm a private citizen, not a policeman.<br>
<p>
If you do intend to make it illegal, I must assume that you feel that law enforcement<br>
is a valid concept and that government is necessary. If you to not intend to make it<br>
illegal, you must enforce the law yourself or through a collective. But you will<br>
be attempting to enforce a law against dissemenation of information that I acquired<br>
in a public place. This is ethically unreasonable and technically very difficult.<br>
<p>
Brin sympathsizes with and shares our desire for privacy. Both he and I agree that<br>
privacy is desirable. It's just becoming incresingly less feasible. Please don't respond<br>
that "privacy is good, we must must keep it." Instead, please describe an approach to<br>
ensuring privacy that may work.<br>
<p>
Brin's solution is to say that since we can't protect our privacy from the government and<br>
other wealthy organizations and individuals, then the government and others should not<br>
have privacy either. This is what is meant by "so what?" When everybody's public activities<br>
are reviewable by everybody else, the range of acceptable activity will get a lot<br>
broader.<br>
