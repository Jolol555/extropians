<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; I've seen a serious proposal for a system which could bring down an </i><br>
<i>&gt;  entire 747 by parachute in a serious inflight emergency (or individual </i><br>
<i>&gt;  pieces if the plane should partially break up in flight). The problem is </i><br>
<i>&gt;  again cost and mass; AFAIR it requires fourteen large parachutes fitted </i><br>
<i>&gt;  to various parts of the plane.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I seem to recall some time ago that one of the combat aircraft (?) was fitted</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a system whereby the entire crew compartment ejected as a whole with</i><br>
<i>&gt; built in parachutes...what would be the problem in having such a concept for</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial passenger aircraft?</i><br>
<p>
The biggest problem with doing exactly that is political: how is it <br>
going to look that the airlines buy that sort of protection for the <br>
crew, but not the passengers?<br>
<p>
Please note that the combat aircraft had an ejection mechanism for <br>
the CREW compartment.  Not the CARGO compartment.<br>
<p>
And, for that matter, the combat aircraft did not have flight <br>
attendants among its crew.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  That is: in the event of a "crash and burn"</i><br>
<i>&gt; emergency the pilot could eject the passenger compartment.</i><br>
<p>
And here you have changed the protection from the CREW compartment to <br>
the CARGO compartment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It then descending</i><br>
<i>&gt; on it's own automatically deployed chutes.  Since said compartment would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; much lighter than the entire airframe  it would possible require less chutes.</i><br>
<p>
Hm... it would lose the wings, wing anchor structure, cockpit, tail <br>
assembly, and part of the undercarriage.  Maybe as much as 2/3 of the <br>
unloaded weight of the aircraft.  It would also have no fuel tanks... <br>
but it WOULD have PASSENGERS.  And it WOULD still have to be <br>
PRESSURIZED.<br>
<p>
But there is a more fundamental problem.<br>
<p>
Typical loss-of-airframe emergency situation involving a military <br>
aircraft in wartime: the plane took damage from enemy fire while at <br>
altitude.  The highly-trained crew is thoroughly strapped in, <br>
five-point harnesses minimum, to seats that are firmly attached to <br>
the ejection assembly and don't adjust.  Depending on the severity of <br>
the situation, they can eject immediately or delay (somewhat) to a <br>
more convenient location.  If they have to eject immediately, a small <br>
pod wrapped around the seat -- if that much -- ejects with them; the <br>
seat is equipped with oxygen gear equivalent to pressurization, which <br>
the crew is already wearing.  And since they are already at altitude, <br>
there is plenty of room for parachutes to deploy, not only cushioning <br>
the fall but also disposing of any forward speed.<br>
<p>
Typical loss-of-airframe emergency situation involving a commercial <br>
airliner: the plane rams into the ground.  That's how much warning <br>
there is.  The untrained passengers are in seats which adjust and are <br>
in uncertain positions; the majority of them, but probably not all, <br>
are wearing two-point safety harnesses (seat belts).  Oxygen masks <br>
are available but the passengers have near-zero training and <br>
absolute-zero experience in their use, and they are not attached to <br>
the passengers.  If the passenger compartment must be ejected, it is <br>
*huge* compared to the passengers it contains, and will take a very <br>
high g-force acceleration to throw it clear of the impact.  Then it <br>
isn't really high enough for chutes to deploy and slow its forward <br>
speed, so its own impact is nearly as bad as the impact of the <br>
airframe.<br>
