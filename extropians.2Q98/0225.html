Abstract<br>
  We investigated the antihypertensive effect of sesamin, a lignan from<br>
  sesame oil, using two-kidney, one-clip<br>
  (2K,1C) renal hypertensive rats. After clipping the left renal artery,<br>
  animals were assigned to either a normal diet group (control group) or a<br>
  sesamin-containing (1% (w/w)) diet group (sesamin group). The sham-operated<br>
  rats (sham group) were fed a normal diet and tap water. The systolic blood<br>
  pressure of the control group increased progressively in comparison with the<br>
  sham group. This 2K,1C-induced hypertension was markedly reduced by feeding<br>
  the sesamin-containing diet. The systolic blood pressure after 4 weeks was<br>
  123.60 +/- 4.01 mmHg in the sham group, 187.43 +/- 5.69 mmHg in the control<br>
  group and 145.57 +/- 6.78 mmHg in the sesamin group, respectively. There were<br>
  significant increases in left ventricle plus septum weight-body weight ratio<br>
  in the control group compared with the sham group. This rise was also<br>
  significantly reduced in the sesamin group. When the thoracic aorta was<br>
  histochemically evaluated, the wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio in the<br>
  control group were significantly increased, compared with the sham group,<br>
  indicating that vascular hypertrophy had occurred in the control group. The<br>
  sesamin diet tended to ameliorate this vascular hypertrophy, although its<br>
  effect was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that sesamin<br>
  is useful as prophylactic treatment to combat the development of renal<br>
  hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.<br>
