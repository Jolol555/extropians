<i>&gt; &gt;Can we really put a definite definition to the word truth?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: Physical reality. Concepts, ideas, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;   claims that are true are those that map onto</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the physical reality as a one-one function.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Beyond the physical reality, a true claim </i><br>
<i>&gt;   is one that follows logically from a given</i><br>
<i>&gt;   set of axioms and such claims are true only </i><br>
<i>&gt;   to the extent they adhere to those axioms</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and may not be true outside those axioms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1. truth is in the eye of the beholder</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: Physics equations can predict physical</i><br>
<i>&gt;   outcomes with little or no room for doubt.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   That Newton's law of gravity F = GmM/r^2</i><br>
<i>&gt;   defines gravity and allows up to predict </i><br>
<i>&gt;   its effects under various conditions is</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a truth NOT "in the eye of the beholder." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  2. bias truth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     a. hitler is viewed as evil by the majority for ordering the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;death of millions,  yet Einstien is viewed as good when in actuality </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;he killed millions more than hitler</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: I doubt that that maps onto the physical </i><br>
<i>&gt;    reality since I don't think that the A-bombs</i><br>
<i>&gt;    killed millions, or that Einstein can be said</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to be fully responsible. Mutual assured de-</i><br>
<i>&gt;    struction may have even saved millions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    If those claims about reality do not map onto</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the physical reality, then they are not true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    They very fact that you cite them means that </i><br>
<i>&gt;    your relying on some standard of truth to </i><br>
<i>&gt;    argue that there is no standard of truth!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     b. Columbus discovered America, usually discovery is of the unknown</i><br>
<i>&gt; (America was already known, and inhabited) and he never saw </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;America</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: So it does not map onto the physical reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;3. my truth is not necessarily your truth, and yours not mine</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    IAN: You mean that you can override gravity?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;4. truth is only a test of you collected knowledge, there fore the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more knowledge the more truth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;5. all truth has the option of being bias</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     IAN: No argument here invalidates the definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;     of truth as the physical reality I just proposed.</i><br>
I mentioned nothing that gravity was the truth, some claim that they <br>
can overcome gravity by blocking that truth from their mind.  then in <br>
fact if they can, gravity may also be a bias truth.  But wait we are <br>
told that all things that have mass have gravity, we think this to be <br>
true, but no one can actually prove it.  Why because much as time <br>
gravity is a human defined reality, it is something we believe to be <br>
present but cannot be absolutely sure that is exists.<br>
<p>
I certainly believe in gravity, but with minimal doubt.  If someone <br>
tells me there is a God in the sky, how do I know he is in the sky?  <br>
Why couldn't he be all around us?<br>
