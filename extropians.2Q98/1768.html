I used to think hermeneutics implied that every interpretation is a mis-<br>
interpretation -- or, at least, that all interpretations are equal.  On this<br>
stance, someone who believed, to use a classic example, Belgium<br>
invaded Germany in World War One is just as right as someone who<br>
believed the opposite as well as someone who believed there was<br>
no war or that Belgium and Germany were both nonbelligerents.<br>
<p>
However, regardless of what I think, the Objectivist movement has<br>
penetrated and been penetrated by hermeneutics.  See, e.g., the<br>
works of Gregory Johnson (his "Hermeneutics: A Protreptic" which<br>
appeared a few years ago in _Critical Review_ gives a semi-<br>
Objectivist view of the subject) and of Chris Sciabarra.  The latter<br>
has a web site at:<br>

It will be interesting to see what hybrids and mutants flourish in such<br>
soil.:)<br>
<p>
Personally, I don't believe _all_ poststructuralist, postmodernists and<br>
hermeneutics is bunk, though like all movements, the members of<br>
these probably do too far and lack perspective.  It's like the New<br>
Critics who saw irony in everything or Freudians who see sex all<br>
over the place.  I'm sure there's a good deal to be learned from all<br>
of them.<br>
