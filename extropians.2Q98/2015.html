<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "If write attempts are made to specific hidden</i><br>

<i>&gt; software will corrupt enough data to foil the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tampering attempt, making the software unusable."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since CD's "cannot be overwritten that easily"</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroying the data contained on the CD wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be an option.</i><br>
<p>
However, since we are talking about serial numbers, in order to escape<br>
the virus guard, you would need to do a straight copy on a dumb copy<br>
device, not on a computer, thus leaving the serial numbers and other<br>
fingerprints intact. When the software is installed, it then becomes<br>
active, and leaves the purchaser open for enforcement actions against<br>
them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you used a small writable sector</i><br>
<i>&gt; or room on the users HD to store a "no copy" file</i><br>
<i>&gt; (a method commonly used) it could be just as</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily changed and wouldn't offer much protection.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Creating systems of copyright protection in both</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware and software on user systems can stop the</i><br>
<i>&gt; initial "casual" copying of files, but cracked</i><br>
<i>&gt; versions are released in next to no time.  So the</i><br>
<i>&gt; only option your virus would have is to destroy</i><br>
<i>&gt; data on the users computer (an option that was</i><br>
<i>&gt; explored on some software in the late 80's).  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; even then the boot sector of the CD need not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; run, so none of the viruses would be initialised</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the first place.</i><br>
<p>
As far as I can tell, any time you put a CD in a drive, or any other<br>
disk in a drive, the drive checks the boot sector of the drive. This is<br>
how you can get a virus from an infected floppy simply by sticking the<br>
disk in the drive. You do not need to 'look at it' in order to give the<br>
virus a go at your system. Granted you could use a specially rigged CD<br>
copying machine, but these are expensive devices, not likely to be owned<br>
by the casual pirate. This cost of entry limits potential pirates to<br>
those with the capital to take the risk. Thus this limits the potential<br>
pirates, and eases enfocement.<br>
