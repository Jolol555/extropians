<i>&gt; However, I have to question whether low intelligence indicates a 'chaotic'</i><br>
<i>&gt; view. I would expect the lower intelligence would entail a simpler view of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world. A child begins with a simple view of things around him, and adds</i><br>
<i>&gt; complexity as he grows and learns. A less intelligent person does not learn</i><br>
<i>&gt; as quickly, and would be less sophisticated in his views.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder how intelligence and experience influences the worldview; on<br>
one hand, there are plenty of people who live in a simple<br>
black-and-white world, on the other hand others who think the world is<br>
fundamentally chaotic and incomprehensible. Maybe this isn't a<br>
question about intelligence and education, but whether they find that<br>
seeing the world as complex or understandable are useful. <br>
<p>
For example, a person living in a narrowminded religious community<br>
would early find that views that are not black and white often get<br>
negative responses from other people, and hence learn a dualistic<br>
mindset. A person who repeatedly fails in school would learn that the<br>
world is incomprehensible and/or that they are stupid (and hence<br>
allowed not to think). In the opposite direction, an intelligent<br>
person in a suitable environment would learn that it is possible to<br>
understand the world usefully, and that by learning more about the<br>
world it becomes more complex (i.e. not just larger and diverse, but<br>
also that it has new levels of organisation).<br>
