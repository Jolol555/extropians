<i>&gt; &gt;my biggest question of all why if someone is muslim do they have to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;follow the christian life style, and don't say that they don't . take </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a look at time!</i><br>
<p>
Original Christianity is a direct offspring of Judaism, which is the <br>
descendant of a storm-god cult within a previous body of religions in <br>
the same area.  Islam is a direct descendant of another cult in the <br>
same budy of religions, and heavily influenced by Judaism.<br>
<p>
To put it in individual-human terms, Sue Islam was raised living <br>
right next door to her mother's sister Jude, and now you're asking <br>
why has the same approach to child-raising as her cousin Chris.<br>
<p>
(Original Christianity was soon modified by Mithraism <br>
and other Greek/Roman religious cults.  But, aside from being a bit <br>
less harsh, the Greek/Roman religious environment wasn't massively <br>
different from the religious environment of the mideast.)<br>
