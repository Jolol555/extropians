I've also done a bit of traveling, including to China not long after the fall<br>
of the "Gang of Four", Nicaragua just at the end of the Sandanista period and<br>
Mexico over a few decades, as well as places with more attractive civil<br>
societies, such as England and Costa Rica (and even Canada) . . . and I have<br>
to echo Chuck's comment.  <br>
<p>
There seem to be two elements to one's feelings about where we are on the<br>
continuum of progress: One is a study of history and the other is one's<br>
personal inclination to optimism or pessimism.  It's hard to separate the two,<br>
but at the extremes one can perhaps be more certain.  Only a fool would have<br>
been optimistic living in Weimar Germany in the late 1920s, but I find that it<br>
is hard to be pessimistic for long living in the United States in the late<br>
1990s.  At this moment in history, the U.S. is experiencing perhaps<br>
unprecedented economic prosperity and opportunity for just about anyone<br>
willing to participate, even the very statist mainstream political parties<br>
make at least public statements in favor of less centralized government and<br>
there seems to me to be as much experimentation in social institutions as<br>
there ever has been.  <br>
<p>
Of course, there are constant struggles in the cause of liberty: Essentially<br>
all institutions and public figures endorse at least some state control over<br>
intimate private activities such as drugs and sex and accept without question<br>
that individuals should be forced to pay for "public goods" of dubious<br>
goodness.  Some of these threats are aimed at core values of liberty, and<br>
there can be no doubt that the mainstream conception of the proper reach of<br>
state power is greater than it was during the zenith of classical liberal<br>
thought in the Anglo-American world from the late 18th to the late 19th<br>
century.<br>
<p>
But all over the world, far beyond the borders of the States, I see causes for<br>
hope: The communist nightmare has passed as the bad dream that it was, only a<br>
lingering memory in Cuba and North Korea, and not long to haunt people there;<br>
there isn't a single real military dictatorship in Latin America I can think<br>
of; a black man is the president of South Africa and elsewhere on that<br>
continent civil society is at least becoming aware of the tribalistic passions<br>
that have wracked it for centuries; and in Asia people are perhaps at last<br>
facing the consequences of carrying too much of Confucianism forward into a<br>
capitalist world order.<br>
<p>
True, there are deeply troubling problems in the world.  The worst is probably<br>
the swath of the planet from the Balkans to Sri Lanka dominated by<br>
fundamentalism and primitive religious bigotry; where the concept of civil<br>
society has only a tenuous hold over the human condition.  Here in America,<br>
seemingly growing numbers of baby boomers are turning to traditional religious<br>
institutions or "new age" pseudo science in reaction to realization of their<br>
own mortality.  Throughout the "developed world" the mainstream supports<br>
legislative restriction on at least some promising biotechnology.<br>
<p>
But in much of the world the material conditions of even average people is<br>
superior to that of  kings of old and, despite a few luddite laws here and<br>
there, economic pressures compel an accelerating feedback of research and<br>
development of key transhumanist technologies.  It seems increasingly<br>
improbable to me that fundamentalists could stop that trend before we reach<br>
some sort of critical point in our ability to use technology to transcend<br>
traditional human limits.  Regardless of what spokesmen for the mainstream may<br>
SAY, in fact the best and the brightest are working around the clock to put<br>
the tools of transcendence in our hands.<br>
<p>
Sure I'd like things to happen faster and for life to be more free.  And we<br>
should all do what we can to make it so.  But in the meantime I, at least,<br>
feel that this is a time for optimism and pride.<br>
