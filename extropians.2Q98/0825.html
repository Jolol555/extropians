<i>&gt;&gt;You see, just that Extropy is a cult</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Frankly, Eric, I find your use of cult in describing extropy rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;annoying.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is obvious. Most Scientologists would probably also be annoyed when<br>
Scientology was called a cult by others.<br>
<p>
IAN: It's an easy cheap shot. Unfortunately<br>
  any group with a set of principles and unique<br>
  beliefs can be framed as "a cult." The more<br>
  unique the beliefs the more easily framed.<br>
<p>
  But, clearly, no honest person could ascribe<br>
  to the ExI any of the attributes of a cult,<br>
  such a brainwashing, unswerving obedience,<br>
  surrender of one's possessions... So the<br>
  charge is just a baseless and malicious<br>
  insult intended to inflame, don't let<br>
  it. It is a meme that feeds off the<br>
  energy of the inflammation caused.<br>
<p>
Let's clear the definitions first.<br>
<p>
cult n, often attrib [F &amp; L; F culte, fr. L cultus care, adoration, fr.<br>
colere to cultivate--more at wheel] (1617) 1:<br>
formal religious veneration: worship 2: a system of religious beliefs and<br>
ritual; also: its body of adherents 3: a religion<br>
regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also: its body of adherents 4: a system<br>
for the cure of disease based on dogma set<br>
forth by its promulgator &lt;health ~s&gt; 5 a: great devotion to a person, idea,<br>
object, movement, or work (as a film or<br>
book); esp: such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad b: a<br>
usu. small group of people characterized by such<br>
devotion -- cul.tic adj -- cult.ish adj -- cult.ish.ly adv -- cult.ish.ness<br>
n -- cult.ism n -- cult.ist n -- cult.like adj<br>
<p>
(Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition)<br>
<p>
I am referring to definition number 2: a system of religious beliefs and<br>
ritual, its body of adherents.<br>
<p>
A system<br>
<p>
    (the ExI)<br>
<p>
of religous beliefs<br>
<p>
re.li.gious adj [ME, fr. OF religieus, fr. L religiosus, fr. religio] (13c)<br>
1: relating to or manifesting faithful devotion<br>
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity &lt;a ~ person&gt; &lt;~ attitudes&gt; 2:<br>
of, relating to, or devoted to religious beliefs<br>
or observances 3 a: scrupulously and conscientiously faithful b: fervent,<br>
zealous -- re.li.gious.ly adv --<br>
re.li.gious.ness n<br>
<p>
be.lief n [ME beleave, prob. alter. of OE geleafa, fr. ge-, associative<br>
prefix + leafa; akin to OE lyfan] (12c) 1: a<br>
state or habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person<br>
or thing 2: something believed; esp: a tenet<br>
or body of tenets held by a group 3: conviction of the truth of some<br>
statement or the reality of some being or<br>
phenomenon esp. when based on examination of evidence<br>
<p>
    the religous belief in a free will and individual freedom<br>
    the religous belief in extropy which is considered as an ultimate<br>
reality<br>
    the belief in the solution of today's problems through the use of<br>
superior technology<br>
<p>
and ritual,<br>
<p>
ritual n (1649) 1: the established form for a ceremony; specif: the order of<br>
words prescribed for a religious ceremony<br>
2 a: ritual observance; specif: a system of rites b: a ceremonial act or<br>
action c: a customarily repeated often formal act<br>
or series of acts<br>
<p>
    Although it is not obvious, the regular meetings of Extropians could be<br>
considered a ritual.<br>
<p>
its body of adherents<br>
<p>
    Extropians, obviously.<br>
<p>
It is not my fault that cults generally have such a negative image.<br>
Certainly,  "brainwashing, unswerving obedience,<br>
surrender of one's possessions" are not the attributes that make up a cult,<br>
although many cults have such features.<br>
