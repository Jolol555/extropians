<i>&gt; From:          Paul Hughes &lt;planetp@aci.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is good evidence that a cetacean's sound repertoire is as complex as</i><br>
<i>&gt; our own, indicating language.  Yet we still haven't a clue what they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'talking' about.  If we can't decode what an alien species is saying that</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolved on the same planet as us, imagine how much more difficult it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; to communicate with species from completely alien worlds.</i><br>
<p>
Cetacea are completely non-technological, and aquatic.<br>
<p>
Assume for the sake of argument that, except as compelled by those <br>
two facts, they are psychologically human.  (A pretty unlikely <br>
assumption, by the way).  What *would* they talk about?<br>
<p>
Work?  They are, variously, hunters and gatherers.  Being completely <br>
non-technological, there aren't a lot of techniques available to them <br>
and they've been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years.  It's <br>
a good bet that all good techniques are common knowledge.<br>
<p>
Girls?  Remember their speech mechanism.  A guy talking about his <br>
girlfriend, even if he mumbles, can be heard clearly for several <br>
hundred miles.<br>
<p>
Possibly the current location of food.  But that won't produce a lot <br>
of vocalizing.<br>
<p>
The single good bet I can come up with, is that they chat <br>
about their kids.<br>
<p>
Human observers, watching a bunch of mothers chat about their kids, <br>
often can't later figure out what was said even when they understand <br>
the language! <br>
