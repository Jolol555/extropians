Care to tell that to all those who support the American Confederacy?  You<br>
can only "leave and split the community" (aka secede) if the voting<br>
majority hasn't forbidden it.<br>
<p>
*I* don't agree with most of Congress's laws, but it's still illegal for me<br>
to sit in my house and secede from the USG.  Try it yourself.<br>
<p>

<p>
And if my delegate misrepresents me?  See above.<br>

<i>&gt;therefore no decision.</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely.  Now, imagine direct consensus democracy happening on a<br>
very small scale, even between just two people at a time, all over the<br>
country.  Plus, since both participants agree on the "vote" beforehand,<br>
they will almost never need to be forced to agree with themselves (except<br>
when they change their minds after voting).  Now imagine people calling<br>
these votes "contracts" and calling this system "the free market."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Which parties? Political parties?</i><br>
<p>
Participants.  Individuals making a deal.  All of them do so voluntarily in<br>
a free market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Does you really mean that hunger is a voluntary feeling?</i><br>
<p>
You may not volunteer to be hungry, but unless you can either feed yourself<br>
or someone else volunteers to feed you, you will remain hungry.  In a free<br>
market, you usually convince somebody to voluntarily feed you by helping<br>
them out in exchange; you cannot force someone else to feed you, however.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Have you ever notices the "military" decision making procedures inside the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;industrial companies? --</i><br>
<p>
So they are competetive.  Fortunately, in the case of companies, they're<br>
competing to see who can perform the services which are worth the most to<br>
the most people... note that each and every buyer co-operates voluntarily<br>
when they buy goods, and that the company which performs services which are<br>
not worth enough to enough buyers eventually goes out of business.<br>
<p>
The military, on the other hand, competes in the arena of force.  It<br>
requires no one's consent, and in no way competes in a way that maximizes<br>
co-operation.  The essential differences between these organizations,<br>
therefore, is vast, even if they are both competing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once the managment have made a decision, it have to force its operations  </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the majority of workers.</i><br>
<p>
This is completely wrong.  Under capitalism, corporations can't (legally)<br>
force their employees to do anything.  All of the employees volunteer to<br>
work in a corporation.  All those who don't volunteer to do what the CEO<br>
wants don't have to work there at all.  How is this force?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Therefore capitalism in its dayly reality  </i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't much closer to "spontaneous order" than democracy.</i><br>
<p>
Only your direct consensus democracy is actually spontaneous, and this I<br>
agree with.<br>
