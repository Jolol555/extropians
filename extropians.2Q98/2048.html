Well that's only if we keep viewing programs as finished blocks of code<br>
like it is now. If instead we view it as evolving systems, which<br>
upgrades/updates in realtime. Then there's suddenly a very god<br>
possibility of copy protection of software. What if you made some<br>
software that people really wants which upgrades via the net by the use<br>
of a serial number. Then there would be good reasons to "subscribe" to<br>
the software. It would be easy to close down a number that updated too<br>
many times and from too many places.<br>
<p>
Also it would be both possible and wise to rent out this kind of<br>
software more inexpensively than software currently is. As any good<br>
bussinesman can tell you. The easiest customer to get is a return<br>
customer. This would furthermore discourage from pirating due to the low<br>
price.<br>
<p>
I think there is far to much emphasis on open source, and the free<br>
software on the net. Of course theres Linux, but it's still a fringe<br>
product, And the few good examples of open source doesn't make for a<br>
complete change in the way of the world. Netscape btw. still has to<br>
prove that their open way of doing things is better than Microsofts.<br>
Naturally distribution systems and pricing will change, but most of our<br>
software will still cost money. We will might not buy it in big dead<br>
lumps like today but more like a flexible subscription.<br>
<p>
Freeware, and open source will coexist together with traditional<br>
of-the-shelf products, and any other way we can concieve selling and<br>
distributing software.<br>
