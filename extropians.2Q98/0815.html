I would love to read your "aboliton of work" post, but I just re-joined this list<br>
a few hours ago.  Could you re-send it to me?<br>
<p>
Wow, as for the rest of your post, it is very well written and thought-out.<br>
However, perhaps I'm missing a key element to your argument, but I somwhow missed<br>
how it addresses the trend of increasing automation.  My concern will take some<br>
explaining:<br>
<p>
Here are some job sectors that will most likeley no longer require humans over the<br>
coming years:<br>
<p>
1) The Retail Sector:  This sector employs 10's of millions of people.  With the<br>
advent of e-commerce and online stores, retail store fronts will find it<br>
increasing difficult to compete with online direct channel lines - they are<br>
cheaper because they cut out the costs of physcial store infrastructure and<br>
distributor chains.  Car dealers are a good example of a punishing buying<br>
experience that most people would rather avoid.<br>
<p>
2) The Service sector - online banking and automated tellers will almost<br>
completely obsolete the need for phyical banks and human tellers.  Banks are just<br>
itching to jump into the online e-commerce revolution.  Consider the demise of the<br>
postal service, as<br>
telecommunication is taking hold.<br>
<p>
3)  Industrial Workers - of course this sector is an obvious one that has already<br>
succumbed to automation.  Either manufacturers will resort to automation as it<br>
becomes increasingly cheaper or rely on cheaper and cheaper labor in desperate<br>
third-world countries.  Whichever is cheaper.  However automation is getting<br>
cheaper and more sophisticated all the time.<br>
<p>
So here is my question:<br>
<p>
With the 100's of millions to be displaced by this sophisticated automation, what<br>
kinds of jobs will they be able to do instead?  Are you suggesting that eventually<br>
all of us will become doctors, sceintists, engineeers, designers, artists and<br>
writers?  Because those are the only types of jobs that I can see that will be the<br>
last to succumb to automation.<br>
