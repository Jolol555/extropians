If you really think you're right: pick ten of the most likely candidates<br>
for Y2K problems. On Dec. 31, 1999, borrow as many shares of each<br>
company's stock as your broker will let you. Sell them immediately. By<br>
the end of the day January 2, 2000, you can buy the stocks back for a<br>
fraction of the purchase price. Give them back to your broker. You keep<br>
the difference. <br>
<p>
Of course, with all the hubbub, Y2K is the perfect squeeze play<br>
scenario. Lots of people I know are eyeing 2K as the time to sell short.<br>
The risk is when a stock that is heavily shorted actually drops only a<br>
tiny bit. If it looks like it's going to stay, short sellers will<br>
scramble to buy, driving the price up. The loss comes when you buy too<br>
late.   <br>
<p>
Does anyone know if you can sell short on US Govt securities?<br>
