   Gerhard contends that the "A = -A" statement is<br>
   false, as it would be if we say that A is 100%<br>
   the same as -A, but it is not false in an im-<br>
   portant context. Let's see how A can = -A.<br>
<p>
   Here's an obvious example where A = -A:<br>
<p>
   If A = 30% of U and -A = 70% of U, in the context<br>
   of volume we say that A =/= -A, or the volumes of <br>
   A and -A are different. If A = 50% and -A = 50%,<br>
   then A = -A with respect to volume. With respect <br>
   to location, color, etc, it may be that A =/= -A.<br>
<p>
   So A = -A and does not = -A at the same time in <br>
   different contexts. When mystics say A = -A (or<br>
   something to that effect) they are referring to <br>
   a primordial context that maps the structure of<br>
   identity. So what is this "mystical" context?<br>
<p>
   If we should ask, what is the degree to which a thing,<br>
   A, is a required feature of the identity of A, and what <br>
   is the degree to which another thing, -A, is a required<br>
   feature of A, we find that the answer is that the degree<br>
   to which A requires A is EQUAL to the degree that A re-<br>
   quires -A for A to exist. So "the degree of A" = "the <br>
   degree of -A" with respect to the degree to which <br>
   either is necessary for the existence of A, and<br>
   in this fundemental context, indeed A = -A.<br>
<p>
   That's the true meaning of the mystical axiom: A = -A.<br>
   Even if A = 90% of the spacetime volume of U, while -A <br>
   only = 10%, the identity of A requires that 10% to a <br>
   degree that is equal to its requirement for the 90%.<br>
   A = -A expresses the equality of identity dependence.<br>
<p>
   Saying "A =/= -A" says, "A is different than -A,"<br>
   and it's precisely the difference between A and -A <br>
   (with respect to features of identity such as color, <br>
   size, speed, etc.) that is the basis of the relational, <br>
   or differential, dependence of A and -A upon each other <br>
   for their unique identity features, and which therefore <br>
   renders the "A = -A" statement true with respect to<br>
   the degree of dependence for identity existence.<br>
<p>
   A = A if, and only if, A =/= -A, which means that for<br>
   A to exist A must be differentiated from -A, which means<br>
   that A requires -A as much as A (itself), and the degree<br>
   to which A requires -A = the degree to which A requires A.<br>
<p>
   So when we say "A =/= -A" we say that A has features that <br>
   are different than the features of -A, and when we say <br>
   that "A = -A" we say that the degree to which A requires <br>
   -A for its identity is equal to the degree A requires A. <br>
   Hence the identity structure of A contains both A and -A,<br>
   and the identity of A spreads out beyond the limits of A.<br>
<p>
   We can express this via the holistic set theory I've <br>
   proposed, which defines the "A = -A" context of A as <br>
   (super)A. (super)A is the superstructure of the iden-<br>
   tity of A that contains all the features that are re-<br>
   quired for the existence of (in)A. (in)A is the in-<br>
   terior region of the entity called "A." (super)A <br>
   contains both (in)A and (out)A, and (out)A is <br>
   simply the external area of (in)A. So:<br>
<p>
   (super)A = {(in)A, (out)A}<br>
<p>
   and (in)A =/= (out)A<br>
<p>
   which states that (in)A is different than (out)A.<br>
   When we add entities to (out)A, we have overlapping<br>
   identity mappings, which my upcoming pages cover.<br>
