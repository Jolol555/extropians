Let's establish a convention here.  Small-o objectivism<br>
will stand for the standard dictionary defintion of the<br>
term, while large-O Objectivism will stand for the <br>
philosophy of Ayn Rand and those in her tradition<br>
(regardless of whether she or they accept this:) such<br>
as Nathaniel Branden, Leonard Peikoff, David Kelley,<br>
George Walsh and Chris Sciabarra.<br>
<p>
Basic tenets of Objectivism are, as Rand and others<br>
put it:<br>
<p>
Metaphysics: Reality<br>
Epistemology: Reason<br>
Ethics: Rational Self-Interest<br>
Politics: Laissez-faire capitalism<br>
Esthetics: Romanticism<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but I'm mostly attracted to the free-market</i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarianism that seems to result from such</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought.  On the other hand, I'm also attracted to</i><br>
<i>&gt;some of the (predominantly) European science and</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophy that emphasizes constructivist aspects of</i><br>
<i>&gt;human knowledge and 'non-Cartesian cognitive science'</i><br>
<i>&gt;\1, even though (unfortunately) many of these same</i><br>
<i>&gt;sources seem to gravitate toward socialistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;economics &amp; politics \2 \3.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the wording above, do you think that Objectivism</i><br>
or objectivism are Cartesian?  What do you mean by<br>
Cartesian?  I tend to think of it, simply, as stuff<br>
stemming from Descartes philosophy with its emphasis<br>
on an ontology of mind-body dualism and a skeptical<br>
view of epistemology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More coherent objections to Objectivism (than those</i><br>
<i>&gt;mentioned in note 3 ;) are raised by Hungarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;physician, chemist, and philosopher Michael Polanyi</i><br>
<i>&gt;(whose major work - _Personal Knowledge: Towards A</i><br>
<i>&gt;Post-Critical Philosophy_ - I am trying to read</i><br>
<i>&gt;sporadically).  Polanyi's work describes what he</i><br>
<i>&gt;calls 'tacit knowledge'.</i><br>
<p>
I have the book, but have not managed to read it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A good online intro to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Polanyi's thought is Richard T. Allen's 1996</i><br>
<i>&gt;Polanyiana article \4, "Polanyi's Overcoming of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dichotomy of Fact and Value", where Allen declares:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Life then is a realm of achievement and not of mere</i><br>
<i>&gt;processes and events... there are no neutral facts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;nor mere descriptions of them, in the realms of</i><br>
<i>&gt;machinery and devices, organisms and organs, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;conscious beings and intelligent and intentional</i><br>
<i>&gt;activities. The facts here are complexities of</i><br>
<i>&gt;success and failure, correctness and incorrectness,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and can be understood only as such".</i><br>
<p>
Before reading Allen's essay, I'd like to mention two<br>
things.  One, Objectivism does not posit a dichotomy<br>
between fact and value.  In fact (no pun intended),<br>
Rand and others in her camp believe value to be<br>
derived from fact.  Some Objectivists -- Leonard<br>
Peikoff, for example -- believe there are no neutral<br>
facts for seemingly the same reason: conscious<br>
things being living things must pursue values and<br>
therefore all things either help or harm them.  Two,<br>
objectivism of the small-o kind is often applied to<br>
the field of ethics to mean that there are objective<br>
moral standards, and usually honesty is one of<br>
them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This Allen article is strongly critical of what he</i><br>
<i>&gt;calls 'Objectivism'. I think what he means by</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objectivism follows Polanyi's usage and primarily</i><br>
<i>&gt;refers to behaviorist psychology and Marxist</i><br>
<i>&gt;sociology, plus strongly reductionist science that</i><br>
<i>&gt;attempts to reduce everything to the physico-chemical</i><br>
<i>&gt;level of description, and (perhaps) not necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt;(at least not explicitly) to the Objectivism</i><br>
<i>&gt;enunciated by Ayn Rand and her elaborators.</i><br>
<p>
Rand and her cohorts were/are critics of behaviorism,<br>
Marxism and reductionism too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let me cite a passage from the end of Polanyi's</i><br>
<i>&gt;_Personal Knowledge_ (I skipped ahead ;) which, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think, shows the extropic nature of his thought \5: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Let me now introduce the concept of a heuristic</i><br>
<i>&gt;field... The lines of force in a heuristic field</i><br>
<i>&gt;should stand for an access to an opportunity, and for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the obligation and the resolve to make good this</i><br>
<i>&gt;opportunity, in spite of its inherent</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncertainties... Can we see then all the works of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;human mind invisibly inscribed already in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;configuration of the primeval incandescent gasses?</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, we cannot; for the capacity of coming to life is</i><br>
<i>&gt;due to the power of a field to consolidate centres of</i><br>
<i>&gt;first causes. Each such centre bears a possibility of</i><br>
<i>&gt;achievement which, however limited, uncertain, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;unspecifiable in its outcome, characterizes this</i><br>
<i>&gt;centre as an essentially new and autonomous prime</i><br>
<i>&gt;mover".</i><br>
<p>
Okay...:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;\3. I am also morbidly fascinated with the radical</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophy of Deleuze &amp; Guattari (I would say</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropian, *in some respects* - see, for instance,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the surplus-value semiotics described in the Guattari</i><br>
<i>&gt;interview mentioned below), despite their avowed</i><br>
<i>&gt;communism; because, I think this politics is</i><br>
<i>&gt;sometimes the result of social situations and, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;another life (or if they'd paid attention to the work</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Friedrich Hayek), they might have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;anarcho-capitalists rather than anarcho-socialists. </i><br>
<p>
Perhaps.  It might be that free market viewpoints<br>
aren't really taken seriously because they are<br>
traditionally associated with socially conservative<br>
types and because of the typical intellectual<br>
[elistist] attitude toward everyday life and business.<br>
<p>
Also, given that in mixed economies businesses<br>
often collaborate with governments -- e.g.,<br>
regulatory capture, subsidies for industries, and<br>
support of laws which limit competition (such as<br>
import quotas, tariffs, bank portfolio requirements),<br>
it is often hard to separate the market from the<br>
government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For example, Felix Guattari noted (see</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://www.dc.peachnet.edu/~mnunes/guattari.html#p1.6">http://www.dc.peachnet.edu/~mnunes/guattari.html#p1.6</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;) "this left-right split is absolutely evident in</i><br>
<i>&gt;social struggles, in power relations ... But on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;level of thought, it's not at all clear." He then</i><br>
<i>&gt;goes on to cite, for example, how he agrees with</i><br>
<i>&gt;Milton Friedman on the legalization of 'drugs'. </i><br>
<p>
The problem here is that many on the left would agree<br>
with the libertarian view on legalizing drugs.  However,<br>
that's merely one position out of many.  (Which is one<br>
reason to think in principles.  We get to see why people<br>
who differ in other areas agree in this one.)<br>
<p>
Overall, I do not see tacit knowledge as anathema to<br>
Objectivism or objectivism.  Or vice versa.  Nor do I<br>
confuse Cartesianism -- which here I take it you mean<br>
a form of philosophy that maintains "all knowledge is<br>
not tacit" -- with Objectivism or objectivism.<br>
<p>
The beginning of many philosophical debates is often<br>
a narrowing of choices such that one idea (or philosophy)<br>
is confused with others, than a whole category is rejected<br>
without being examined.  While dialectical thinking might<br>
held us to clean up this mistake, given that we are finite<br>
(for now:), I urge caution.<br>
