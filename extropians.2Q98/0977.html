My engineering naivete?  I was simply talking thermodynamics.  I see energy<br>
consumption increasing by many, many orders or magnitude in the transhuman<br>
near future.  Most of the things worth doing that haven't been done are<br>
limited by either energy or technology.  Remove the technology barrier to<br>
the entire population of the planet and energy consumption will skyrocket,<br>
just to feed the technology.  Energy consumption is increasing rapidly as<br>
it is.  Readily available energy only seems abundant by current standards.<br>
When your average engineering project starts having peta-watt energy<br>
requirements on a 24/7 basis as a routine part of transhuman life, finding<br>
local, high-quality energy sources will become an issue.  I think a<br>
not-too-far-future society could burn up the useful energy of the Solar<br>
system pretty quickly without trying too hard.  Power technologies like<br>
OTEC could be widely useful now, but the energy density is probably<br>
insufficient to meet the needs of the not-so-far future.<br>
<p>
<p>
I am quite certain that I will not be the only person spending their time<br>
(as part of the new "leisure class") finding really interesting ways to<br>
burn cosmic quantities of energy, given that technology is no barrier and<br>
cost is no object.<br>
