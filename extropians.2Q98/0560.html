<p>
Let's say: a great part of human society seeks a master they can love<br>
unconditionally. Most of those people don't seek though - they think<br>
they have found "him" already. And a part of those would die for this<br>
master, or even kill people who might be a "danger" to their master.<br>
There's a great variety of different "masters", and also a great variety<br>
of behaviours towards that (imaginary or real) master.<br>
<p>
Others are their own masters.<br>
