My dim understading of the history of law is that the position on liability<br>
has changed.  Traditionally liability was strict; you were responsible for any<br>
failings traceable to you.  But in the past few centuries the common law has<br>
evolved to included a concept of negligence, where one is not fully<br>
responsible for mistakes.  Posner suggests that this is due to an increasing<br>
ability to tell when someone has been negligent.  This suggests that this form<br>
of copyright should be subject to strict liability, or a liability stricter<br>
than current common forms.<br>
<p>
OTOH, of course, people will be less willing to buy rights if they fear<br>
retribution for any leakage, and doubt their ability to control it.  I can't<br>
help thinking that for all its problems and absurdities the current copyright<br>
and patent system does accomplish the jobs of temporary recompense and later<br>
openess.  But I've been reading much Hayek, and am feeling more like a<br>
classical liberal than an anarchist.<br>
