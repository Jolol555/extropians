In a message dated 98-06-25 02:10:14 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Well hold on now.  The issue was whether we could reconcile the idea of God<br>
 with the presence of evil and not end up with the conclusion that we should<br>
 not try to overcome evil ourselves.  It simply has nothing to do with the<br>
 particulars of any specific religion &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Andrew, I should have included a paragraph tying this together with that<br>
reconciliation theme.   <br>
<p>
I can't reconcile god with evil because i simply can't buy the argument that<br>
god is standing aside, neutral.  Observing.  Letting us make it or not.  For<br>
one simple reason.  There is no such thing as being neutral in such a<br>
situation.  It is, say, Charles Mansons, choice to commit evil. Fine.  What<br>
about his victims?. Where did their choice go? Or the victims of horrible<br>
diseases, accidents and the like. These may not be things you consider evil,<br>
but I certainly consider any god that would sit by and permit such,  to be<br>
evil, ruthless, and sadistic.  <br>
<p>
Since I observe such evils to exist, I can only come to one of two<br>
conclusions; either god does not exist, or he is one cruel bastard.   It<br>
honestly seems to me that most attempts to reconcile the two result in a<br>
grasping at straws, at best.  <br>
Sure, we can come up with a theory to explain just about anything. Finding one<br>
or three or a dozen that allow for god to exist and for him to allow evil to<br>
exist isn't that hard.  But they strike me as lame attempts to hold on to a<br>
superstition and fearful outlook on the world and the universe.  <br>
<p>
Thanks for your comments..be well, Cori<br>
