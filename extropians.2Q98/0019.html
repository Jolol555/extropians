Lee, if you don't believe in democracy and are transhumanist, this is<br>
your right.<br>
Den , if you like the traditional Afghan way of dealing with criminals<br>
and see yourself as a transhumanist, this is certainly your right too.<br>
As Nick said in his principles/declaration/manifesto, "transhumanism is<br>
politically neutral" (and yes, I find this sentence useful).<br>
<p>
But, because the posts of this list are archived and I worry, as Arjen<br>
does, about PR of transhumanism, I cannot let strangers or newbies<br>
believe that these extremist positions are in some way representative of<br>
transhumanist thought.(even if I aknowledge the fact that the posters<br>
used wisely the "I find", "I think" words).<br>
I'm a transhumanist: this means I want to abolish death and suffering.<br>
As such, I think my job is to accelerate my own evolution and help<br>
people to do the same thing, not to punish them with tortures or<br>
sentence them to death.<br>
I'm an antiauthoritarian: I think democracy is the closest form of<br>
"spontaneous order " that we know, the best way we found to limit, and<br>
eventually break down, power structures. Other find that capitalist<br>
libertarianism is a better way. That's their right. But this choice is<br>
not an official part of the transhumanist package (for extropians, I<br>
don't know: if I understood some earlier Max's posts, it's more complex<br>
than usually said).<br>
<p>
A last word about humanism: I don't know what is exactly "council for<br>
secular humanism", but the fundamental text about humanism is certainly<br>
the "Manifesto on human dignity" by Pico de la Mirandola, written during<br>
the Renaissance, and there is certainly nothing in it which contradict<br>
transhumanism. Transhumanism seems to me a natural follow-up of<br>
humanism, not an adverse ideology<br>
<p>
