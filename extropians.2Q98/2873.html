<p>
<p>
That's far from obvious to me. I agree that exponential growth is involved <br>
but I come to the opposite  conclusion. If I increase the complexity of my <br>
encryption algorithm so that it takes me twice as long to encrypt a message, <br>
I have made my code not twice,  but millions of times more difficult for an <br>
attacker to break. The government  has access to more powerful computers than <br>
I do, but not that much more powerful. For the first time in human history <br>
everybody on Earth will soon  have the ability to communicate with anyone on <br>
Earth in complete privacy.<br>
<p>
Of course there is still the matter of physical privacy, secret cameras,  <br>
microphones and the like, I'm sure they will be used but I see no way they <br>
could keep everyone under surveillance all the time as Brin thinks, there is  <br>
no enough wireless bandwidth, the signal can be blocked or jammed and due to  <br>
the wave nature of light there is a limit to how small a camera can be made.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Brin's solution to the problem is simply to agree that all actions         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;in public places are public, and give access to the scanners to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anybody at all who wants it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I haven't read "The Transparent Society" and have absolutely no intention of  <br>
doing so. I don't know if Brin's views have moderated, but I do know that <br>
when I corresponded with him on this subject a year and a half ago he made no  <br>
distinction between public and private places, there were no private places<br>
and everybody would live every second of their lives in a fishbowl, just as <br>
Trueman did in the movie.<br>
<p>
I must say that corresponding with Brin was  the strangest experience I ever <br>
had on the net. His first letter was almost friendly and pretty intelligent <br>
but in each subsequent letter he seemed to drop another 15 IQ  points. <br>
It was very odd and I have no explanation for it.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How do you propose to stop an observer, government or private? by         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;force of law? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, I'm willing to take my chances with technology, if you're smarter than me  <br>
and get through my privacy defenses then so be it.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I must assume that you feel that law enforcement is a valid concept </i><br>
          <br>
Yes.<br>
          <br>
<i>        &gt;and that government is necessary. </i><br>
<p>
No.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;please describe an approach to ensuring privacy that may work.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I want no special treatment and I certainly don't want privacy laws, I just <br>
want government to get out of the way, I'll take care of my privacy concerns <br>
myself.              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Brin's solution is to say that since we can't protect our privacy         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;from the government and other wealthy organizations and individuals,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;then the government and others should not have privacy either. </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
I guess he hasn't changed much, that's what he was peddling before, but first <br>
he explained to me how evil capitalists and the "techo-elite" were and how <br>
enlightened government bureaucrats can be. He told me there was not even one <br>
example in history were anonymity or as he put it, selling "masks" to the<br>
oppressed, had helped them.  He told me secrecy was always bad because it was <br>
the enemy of accountability.<br>
 <br>
I told him, politely I think, that all the evil corporations have ever done  <br>
was little more than mischief compared to the horrors governments have <br>
committed. I told him  that whatever virtues his Transparent Society might <br>
have were irrelevant because it was inherently unstable and so would never <br>
happen, the idea of a powerful man like the president of the USA allowing <br>
anybody on earth to watch his every move 24 hours a day was not realistic. <br>
I then said those who sold phony ID papers (masks) to the Jews and enabled <br>
them to escape German murderers in the 1930's and 40's certainly helped them <br>
and deserve praise. I asked Brin if he opposed the secret ballot used in all <br>
modern democracies.<br>
<p>
Brin responded to my points by calling me a liar, an ignoramus, a paranoid <br>
little boy, and some other stuff I'd rather not repeat, then he got nasty. <br>
He implied that I was anti Semitic. I still don't know how on earth he got  <br>
that bizarre idea into his head or why he became so hysterical, but I had the  <br>
strong hunch that if I wrote to him again he would reply by questioning the<br>
marital state of my parents and by telling me to do things that may not be  <br>
anatomically possible. I decided that the very last thing he said to me was <br>
good advice, he advised that I "SHUT UP!", so I did. <br>
<p>
As I said it was all very odd.<br>
