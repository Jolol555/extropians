<i>&gt;Can we take it as a given, now, that Mr. Hollick doesn't believe in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the existence of Linux?</i><br>
<p>
Linux is fringe. The user statistics about Linux (like the ones recently published by Wired) seem ridiculously high to me. Usually, they are simply measured by the sales. But of the hundreds of thousands who buy Redhat, how many stay with it? I had installed Linux but had to drop it for lack of usable software (mainly OCR) and usable Plug &amp; Play support.  I suppose many who bought it didn't even manage to install it.<br>
