In general I like what you say.<br>
But just one question? "lost my respect" When is that ?<br>
at what age. I mean, a lot of us are raised in family's<br>
where religion is part of their daily lives. It took me quite<br>
some years to get rid of this an find out that there was<br>
more to life then the principles I was raised with.<br>
So, because of this, I do respect people with an other<br>
view on life. But I want it back too. My boss is a "fanatic <br>
believer" We disagree basically on everything. But we shared<br>
our visions and just let it be..... He doesn't want to change<br>
me and I don't "want" to change him. But I keep letting<br>
him know, that I think he has it all wrong :-)<br>
<p>
To Erik:  respect for an Innovator is not the same as blindly following<br>
his meme's ...............<br>
