<i>&gt; Ok...let me summarize what I think I understand.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A long time ago there were supercontinents...pangea and gondawondaland.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; huge landmasses allowed for tremendous ranges supporting the evolution of</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely large animals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Also...very large critters are an evolutionary response to cooling</i><br>
<i>&gt; enviromental cooling.  Witness whales living in artic waters.  The megafauna</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Ice Ages.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That being the case the HUGE dinosaurs would seem to have been ice age</i><br>
<i>&gt; critters also?</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily. Its a function of their cooling demands. If they spent a lot of<br>
time in water, they would of course be cooled more efficiently than if they were<br>
in open air all the time, so they would trend bigger without necessarily a cold<br>
climate. However, there is some evidence that at least some dinosaurs were evolved<br>
to live in rather chilly climates.<br>
<p>
Additionally, another persons comments about the nutritional content of flora of<br>
the jurassic period is also relevant, in that a) needing to eat much more food to<br>
get equal nutritional content will tend to trend animals to larger sizes, as they<br>
need to engage biological economies of scale to eat right, and that b) larger<br>
animals tend to have slower metabolisms, and thus require a lower percentage of<br>
their body weight in dead mass food intake. Small animals like small birds and<br>
shrew must eat at least their entire body weight each day in food to survive,<br>
while you and I only need around 5% of our body weight or less  in food each day,<br>
using todays highly nutritious food. This is also one reason why modern humans<br>
tend toward the obese (besides the lack of exercise), as their bodies are evolved<br>
for a much less nutritious diet.<br>
<p>
Dinosaurs, which were cold blooded or semi-cold blooded, were evolved to eat a<br>
much less nutritious diet than is presently available. I imagine that if any were<br>
alive today, they would die early of obesity related health problems. THis could<br>
also possibly be a contributing factor to their demise. Imagine that a much more<br>
nutritious plant evolved, which was very sucessful at reproducing and spreading,<br>
and became a staple diet for dinos. All of the herbifores would become fat and<br>
easy for predators to catch, while the predators, now eating this 'cornfed' meat,<br>
would start developing cholesterol problems, cardiopolumonary disease, etc....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmmmmmmm.....Brontosaurs wading thru snowdrifts munching from the tops of</i><br>
<i>&gt; then-equivalent pine forests?  Stegasaurous being the equivalent to Bison?..</i><br>
<i>&gt; Allasuraus being that peroids's dire wolves?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Every critter fills a niche...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; How for wrong am I?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But that leaves the question....64 million years ago when the dinokiller hit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Was it glacial?  Was Gondawandaland (or pangea?) dispersed to be the map we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are more familair with today?  After all the dinoblaster is reputedly resting</i><br>
<i>&gt; beneath the gulf waters near the Yucatan. Were the big dino's already gone</i><br>
<i>&gt; then?</i><br>
<p>
Its thought that most dinos in North America at least were killed off by the<br>
blast, as the regolith from the blast settled mainly over north america, and the<br>
large tidal flood reached far up the missisipi valley to canada.  The amount of<br>
dust blown into the sky would have been up long enough to kill off most plant life<br>
for sufficient time for most of the remaining dinos to die off from starvation,<br>
though I imagine that there were sufficient lizards species that survived that<br>
they were around long enough to become todays modern birds and reptiles, while<br>
creating an instinctual fear of reptiles in mammals.<br>
