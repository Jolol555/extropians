	Subject: 	Re: Alien Communication Re: Ethics of being a<br>
Creator<br>
<p>
	..What if they communicate via odor, or some other strange medium?<br>
An<br>
<i>	&gt;image as such might not even be concievable to them...</i><br>
<i>	&gt;</i><br>
	&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>	&gt;</i><br>
	I don't know. Seems to me that one attribute generally favored by<br>
natural<br>
	selection is increased awareness of one's environment...  &lt;snip&gt; <br>
<p>
i agree with scott.  if et communicates via odor or other medium,<br>
i have to imagine some odor emitting alien scientist would<br>
develop an instrument that works like our eyes.  human<br>
scientists are developing instruments that detect the<br>
"language" of ants by meauring their pheromone emissions.  <br>
<p>
extropians might expect that alien signals would be<br>
understandable because they are carefully <br>
*designed* to be understandable by a wide range of<br>
lifeforms.  now, if the ets can figure out how to communicate<br>
with our whales, i will *really* be impressed.  {8^D  spike<br>
