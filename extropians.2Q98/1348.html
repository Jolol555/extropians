EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!<br>
<p>
Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.<br>
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email<br>
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect<br>
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can<br>
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and<br>
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.<br>
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called<br>
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting<br>
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website<br>
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of<br>
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the<br>
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to<br>
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to<br>
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!<br>
<p>
A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is<br>
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo<br>
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted<br>
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the<br>
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide<br>
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the<br>
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the<br>
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!<br>
<p>
For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors<br>
in New York all you would do is:<br>
<p>
1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in<br>
the words doctor(s) and New York<br>
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the<br>
<a href="http://..">http://..</a>.  for instance it might look like<br>
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s">http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s</a>)/?New+York<br>
3) Press the START button<br>
<p>
THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites<br>
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses<br>
you want.<br>
<p>
The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all<br>
day or all night while you are working on important things or<br>
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a<br>
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give<br>
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at<br>
the end of the day!<br>
