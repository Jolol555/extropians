virus on a floppy, a) on a CD there is plenty of<br>
room for multiple copies to watch over each other,<br>
and b) a CD cannot be overwritten that easily."<br>

Point B is invalid because of your earlier<br>
statement:<br>
<p>
"If write attempts are made to specific hidden<br>
read only files, the virus or worm built into the<br>
software will corrupt enough data to foil the<br>
tampering attempt, making the software unusable."<br>
<p>
Since CD's "cannot be overwritten that easily"<br>
destroying the data contained on the CD wouldn't<br>
be an option.  If you used a small writable sector<br>
or room on the users HD to store a "no copy" file<br>
(a method commonly used) it could be just as<br>
easily changed and wouldn't offer much protection.<br>
Creating systems of copyright protection in both<br>
hardware and software on user systems can stop the<br>
initial "casual" copying of files, but cracked<br>
versions are released in next to no time.  So the<br>
only option your virus would have is to destroy<br>
data on the users computer (an option that was<br>
explored on some software in the late 80's).  But<br>
even then the boot sector of the CD need not be<br>
run, so none of the viruses would be initialised<br>
in the first place.<br>
