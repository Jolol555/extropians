<p>
Religion is not garbage, most true religious belief systems don't pretend to<br>
explain anything. Okay, admittedly there is some pretty lame physics in the<br>
Bible, but the idea wasn't to give a true model, it was for something far<br>
more noble.<br>
<p>
This is really easy to understand, I can summarise in four words...<br>
<p>
            SCIENCE, TRUTH<br>
            RELIGION, MEANING.<br>
<p>
<p>
Science is our greatest method for finding truth, but religion generates<br>
meaning.<br>
<p>
I think you'll find very little true meaning if you worship science alone. I<br>
recommend Ken Wilber's latest book "The marriage of sense and soul" an<br>
excellent attempt to integrate Science AND religion... It can be done, if<br>
you want to do it...<br>
<p>
I get the feeling you don't, however.... and your life will remain<br>
meaningless...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...I don't know what "freedom of spirit" means.</i><br>
<p>
...and you never will until you find it, science won't give it to you,<br>
meaning comes from a place outside the lab — I hope you "get it" soon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;..God and religion have nothing to say about morality, we already know</i><br>
<i>&gt;they have nothing intelligent to say about the physical world so the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclusion to draw is that the millions of words written by the pious are</i><br>
<i>&gt;utterly vacuous.</i><br>
<p>
Another conclusion to draw is that they have a deeper meaning that you'll<br>
never understand if you continue to use your blinkered half-brained<br>
approach. Try reading the above book using BOTH hemispheres and perhaps your<br>
science will help your soul to find true meaning rather than bland<br>
explanations and what are essentially only half-truths...<br>
<p>
I'm not telling you to become religious, you are already a dedicated<br>
worshipper of _S_cience and its High Priests, Fenyman, Sagan, et al.<br>
<p>
I'm telling you that Science will lead you to the top of the mountain but<br>
when you get there you'll have no idea what your looking at unless you<br>
embrace your soul and take a little religion along too.<br>
<p>
I'll say it again. Science will lead you to Truth, Religion will lead you to<br>
meaning. Combine the two and you'll be the happiest man alive....<br>
<p>
Avoid the Bible if it grieves you so, but find some spirit — have you tried<br>
Taoism? Lots of stuff that grooves with Physics!!! And Buddhism...<br>
<p>
Lastly, don't fully embrace any religion — just use your scientific method<br>
to take the bits which work for you and discard the rest.<br>
<p>
Good luck... its a beautiful path, enjoy the ride...<br>
