The basic idea has merit, I always thought the huge star ship Enterprise was  <br>
dumb because there is no point in hauling millions of tons of matter around <br>
the galaxy when you can send the really important part, information, much <br>
easier. The seeds would be very small and if it's a Von Neumann self <br>
replicateor you'd only need to make one. Even if they moved no faster than<br>
existing space probes (a very unlikely possibility) there would be several in <br>
every star system in the galaxy in just an instant of time, less than <br>
50 million years. I don't see any such probes in our galaxy and that's one <br>
reason I think ET's are unlikely.<br>
 <br>
However, before any of this happens we will have achieved immortality and  <br>
mastered Nanotechnology, uploading and artificial intelligence, and it will <br>
be a radically different world. I don't think an organization to promote <br>
this idea could do much good, by the time it happens any ideas we have now on<br>
the subject won't be of any use, it would be like Pikaia, the first animal <br>
with a spinal cord that lived 570 million years ago worrying about the year <br>
2000 computer bug.<br>
