Oh, well then, I'd say you qualify not as an atheist but as a militant<br>
agnostic.  Heh.<br>
<p>
FWIW, and in contrast to your views, I harbor close relations to many, many<br>
theists.  Although I find their judgements about matters theological quite<br>
dicey, that by no means prevents me from respecting their opinions about other<br>
things.  Sometimes I even think that their theological notions merit<br>
respectful treatment.  Think that's heretical?  Get this:  I even know and<br>
respect many *statists*!<br>
<p>
I suppose that tolerance for ideological differences varies widely; I often<br>
find that I enjoy the frisson that comes from rubbing up against different<br>
opinions (even woefully misguided ones).  When it comes to intellectual<br>
companionship, I would rather talk with someone who gets things wrong in<br>
interesting ways than I would with someone who agrees with me in<br>
stultifyingly.<br>
