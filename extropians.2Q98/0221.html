Please identify a plausible y2k-related bug in a computer used in <br>
power-grid management, which could not be worked around acceptably by <br>
(a) disabling the process that sets the date &amp; time to match some <br>
central clock, and then (b) telling the computer it's Jan 1 1980.  <br>
(Recall that perfection is not required.)<br>
<p>
As for the power to bring it up, I'll guarantee that a UPS doesn't <br>
really care what date it is, and the large majority of <br>
system-critical computers can run for at least 20 minutes off their <br>
UPSes.  (The network I used to administer, has doubled the number of <br>
servers since the last time they upgraded the UPS.  So today the UPS <br>
can only power all servers for 35 minutes.)  If that isn't enough, <br>
they'll shut down the servers running financial and office <br>
applications, and drag those UPSes over.<br>

<p>
Um... there is something you don't understand about federal debt.<br>
<p>
It's BONDS.<br>
<p>
Redeemable at a specified time and NOT BEFORE no matter how badly the <br>
person wants to redeem them.<br>
<p>
There are only two categories of bonds that are in any sense <br>
exceptions to this:<br>
<p>
(1) US Savings Bonds, which are an insignificant fraction of the <br>
federal debt, and are 5- or 10-year bonds redeemable 6 months after <br>
issue; and<br>
<p>
(2) the special category of bonds that constitute federally-held <br>
trust funds, and are redeemable upon demand -- if Congress and the <br>
Treasury find it convenient to redeem them at that time.  And the <br>
Social Security Administration won't demand redemption for such a <br>
trivial reason as the government being generally regarded as <br>
bankrupt.<br>
<p>
The shortest-term federal bonds have a term of, if I recall <br>
correctly, 90 days.  So the average outstanding bond of the shortest <br>
term would be redeemable in 45 days.  But IRS income is normally <br>
extremely cyclical, and there is probably little money coming in in <br>
the first 10 days of January anyway: bonds redeemable in that period <br>
are redeemed from funds left over from before, or funds raised by <br>
selling new bonds.  So you're looking at a bare minimum of 10 days, <br>
and probably more than 30, before the IRS's problems actually have a <br>
real impact.<br>
<p>
Can that be gotten around?  Sure.  Take photocopies of the checks and <br>
then go deposit the checks.  When the computers are fixed, then <br>
process the photocopies as if they were checks.<br>
