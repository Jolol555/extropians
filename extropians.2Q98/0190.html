That put's things un a different light ;-) I was not aware of this.<br>

Get back to you in 630 days ;-)<br>

Hmmm, I'd like to see the largest Dutch retail coporation do it's logistics<br>
on paper (they're using a system that makes deep-blue look whimpy to<br>
control their overnight 'just-in-time' supply system - It's suposed to be<br>
y2k-proof, soon we'll know). That should solve a lot of unemployent though ;-)<br>

<i> &gt;The bulletin board</i><br>

<i> &gt;predicting disaster since the 1970's.</i><br>
<p>
I've now got 24 hrs worth of discussion in a sepeate malbox and it seems to<br>
support your statement (see below).<br>

Well, I just read this website.... ;-) OK, I'l try to be less naive (someday).<br>

Yep, that's me trying to bring about the downfall of the US gov't (it seems<br>
a good way to settle some of the other discussions ;-). Actually it's<br>
interesting to see that these memes seem to be much widespread in the US.<br>
Any ideas's on how this (cultural?) difference came about?<br>

Thanks for the lesson in critical web-reading.<br>

This was posted by someone in a related y2k-forum, it might give some<br>
indication about what kind of people are on these forums (the poster<br>
previously stated some of the things that were also stated on this list by<br>
Hal and Dan):<br>

<i>&gt;Hmm. Maybe that last posting wasn't such a good idea. In less than two</i><br>
hours, my e-mail inbox has received numerous messages, two with Word<br>
macro-viruses in the attachments (nice try, folks!), several calling me<br>
(figuratively, of course) an ignorant fathead who allows himself to be a<br>
puppet of the corrupt establishment, one quoting scripture as to the the<br>
events leading up to and just after the Second Coming, and one wishing me a<br>
good time as I burn in Hell for daring to besmirtch the good Dr. North.<br>
Perhaps a bit of clarification is in order.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While I do not even remotely agree with Dr. North's religious, political</i><br>
or economic views, I do find some of his Y2K points interesting and thought<br>
provoking. In reading his material, it caused me to ask questions I had not<br>
thought to ask before. Therefore, even though I do not agree with the bulk<br>
of his conclusions, I feel I have profited from reading his work.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As I have in the past, I will respond to email from people who want to</i><br>
discuss Y2K issues as best I can, but please don't flood me with either<br>
hate mail or attempts to draw me into a religious discussion. The hate mail<br>
only serves to degrade the sender and I will not debate religion.<br>
