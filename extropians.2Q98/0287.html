Dear transhuman friends,<br>
<p>
In my most recent post, I was referring to Max More as that "guy" who<br>
defined "transhumanism".  <br>
<p>
The gracious practice would be to include those who originally defined<br>
words into the discussion.  The definitions of both "transhuman" (FM) and<br>
"transhumanism" has been published.  And, as I understand it,<br>
"transhumanism" is going into a dictionary.<br>
<p>
In explaining ideas to people, what is needed is concise definition and a<br>
manner of explanation that allows individuals who are new to concepts to<br>
grasps the new ideas easily.  This is usually done in stepping-stone ways;<br>
one idea building upon another so that the our ideas are expressed<br>
carefully, openly and reasonably.  Our ideas are fairly far-reaching for<br>
most people, and the best way to do this is not by definition alone, but by<br>
an expression that is inclusive.<br>
<p>
Here I'll refer to both Max More's editorial comments in the most recent<br>
Extropy Newsletter where he explains beautifully his thoughts and feelings<br>
on the subject.  Also, Chris Peterson is quite effective in expressing new<br>
ideas to people in a manner that is inclusive.<br>
<p>
So, to sum up my point, it is my understanding that definitions can be<br>
concise and effective, and further writings on the subject can be expressed<br>
in a manner that draws people in.  <br>
<p>
I'd like to suggest that if we want to redefine "transhuman" let's bring<br>
FM-2030 into the picture.  <br>
<p>
If we want to redefine "transhumanism", let's bring Max More in on the<br>
discussion.<br>
<p>
We are not such an isolated community that we can go around redefining<br>
words when the folks that defined them are within earshot.  Wouldn't it be<br>
more gracious to include them?<br>
<p>
What if I wanted to redefine "nanotechnology."  Would I be wise to include<br>
Drexler in the conversation?  Or, if I wanted to redefine the<br>
"Singularity," I might speak with Vinge about it.  FM has been working in<br>
the field of future studies and social sciences for decades.  He is the<br>
first to teach about transhuman ideas.  He wrote the first book about<br>
transhumans.  Shouldn't we put a call into him for his opinion?  Max<br>
authored the first journal on transhumanism, and made it a philosophy.<br>
Shouldn't we speak with him about this?<br>
<p>
I'm just waiting for someone to redefine Transhumanist Art and to write a<br>
new Transhumanist Art Statement.  I would be terribly hurt and stunned if<br>
that person(s) didn't first speak with me about it.  <br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
<p>
Long Life!<br>
<p>
Natasha<br>
