A couple of years ago someone on this list (I think Greg Burch or Max<br>
More?) posted an idea called MOM or MOMMs or something.  This was a<br>
solution that addressed the fact that the average man will need some<br>
hand-holding and guidance by a mother-type in an anarcho-capitalist<br>
system.  So many are used to Big Brother acting as Mother...  What to<br>
do... What PPA to choose... <br>
