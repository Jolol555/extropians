Hmm, I thought this thread withered away weeks ago...one can only hope.<br>
<p>
The flaw of your statement is I never once assumed anything, most especially 'that<br>
the poor would get poorer.'  Poverty, per say, has nothing to do with it.  It has<br>
to do with the means to providing for your own existence when increasing segments<br>
of the economy become automated.  Being that I made no assumptions, I instead<br>
asked if any there are any free-marketeers, who could explain in as specific terms<br>
as possible, what people will do as more and more jobs get automated?<br>
<p>
For example, what will the millions who are currently occupied in the retail<br>
sector do as this sector fades away from a proliferation of online transactions<br>
and e-cash?  Although some did answer this question with some success, others<br>
assumed they would simply find other jobs (w/o specifying anything), while others<br>
said they would most likely perish.  Neither response lives up to the challenge I<br>
initially offered:<br>
<p>
----------<br>
I'm looking for optimistic free-market mechanisms that yield positive scenarios to<br>
the following questions.<br>
<p>
If people are unemployed through increasing automation, how will they support<br>
themselves?<br>
<p>
For example, if the millions of people being automated out of the retail sector do<br>
find other jobs, what what might those jobs be?  Assuming there is a market for<br>
them, can you say in all honesty that they *all* have the aptitude to be<br>
scientists, artists, designers, or engineers?  If not, then what will they do to<br>
support themselves?<br>
<p>
These are not an assumptions, these are questions - answer them if you can.<br>
<p>
