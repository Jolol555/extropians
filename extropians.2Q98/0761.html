<i>&gt; From: Michael Scarazzo &lt;mscarazzo@rocketmail.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although authors like Sagan think that a spacefaring species would</i><br>
<i>&gt; most likely be friendly, I do not think that will be/is always the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes. Seafaring nations sure weren't always friendly towards other<br>
cultures, so why would this change when they get into space?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is there not the possibility that extremely hostile races would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not destroy themselves?  Instead they might have a sense that they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; supreme and all other species should be subject to them or simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; annihilated?  </i><br>
<p>
And then there's also the possibility that the visitor is not a race,<br>
but a single (planet-sized?) entity. Maybe it's the only survivor of a<br>
titanic battle between Powers. Or maybe it's a super-AI that turned<br>
against its masters...If it's powerful enough, it can be as hostile as<br>
it wants to be. No, benevolence is far from a sure thing when it comes<br>
to extra-terrestrial life.<br>
