"Anyway, I think there's still one type of list<br>

only (or in any case restricted) list for hardcore<br>
transhumanists, where all topics can be discussed<br>
without having to think about PR (you could also<br>
call it "&gt;H uncensored"). There have been some<br>
concerns about the effect of certain topics on<br>
transhuman PR, and this would solve the problem<br>
without compromising the quality of debate<br>
(censorship of any kind, no matter how reasonable<br>
or well-meant, is a killer of critical debate).<br>
The proposed list would also have a restricted<br>
(password etc.) archive, of course."<br>
<p>
Let's say an imaginary "Mr. X" wanted to post a<br>
"uncensored" message to the list, what - in the<br>
purely hypothetical sense - might that message<br>
consist of?<br>
