   IAN: I clearly didn't say M and U were the same <br>
   philosophy. I simply observed that they intersect:<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;As to whether the intersection of M and non-aggression (NA) is entirely</i><br>

<i>&gt;no one to use my gun no matter how important the cause. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Utilitarianism will steal the gun and save the people, then repay the gun</i><br>
<i>&gt;owner in whatever way possible; M U NA would not aggress against the gun</i><br>
<i>&gt;owner.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Yes, that address the issue quite directly.<br>
   Would you say that this defines a degree of dis-<br>
   junction between L and U? We agree as per M and <br>
   U. I find that expressing ideas according to set <br>
   theory helps us "see" what we're talking about,<br>
   and thus maximizes accuracy and understanding.<br>
