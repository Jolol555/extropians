The movie was originally inspired by 'the Gods Must Be Crazy', and there is<br>
a short homage to that movie at the very beginning, along with an homage to<br>
'The Prisoner'.  The directors cited a few other cinematic and philosophical<br>
references, but no science fiction.  Peter Weir, one of the directors, tends<br>
more towards literature and European philosophy.  The underlying themes of<br>
the movie, some cultural and some philosophical, are universal enough to<br>
have found their way into many genres throughout literature.  I certainly<br>
don't think that any science fiction writers invented those themes, although<br>
many have found interesting applications for them.   <br>
<p>
I just realized that our European friends probably won't get to see this for<br>
the next year...<br>
