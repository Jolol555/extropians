<i>&gt;</i><br>

Just remember that the character in the movie was a religious fundamentalist<br>
type, and some of these people sincerely believe that the world literally<br>
revolves around their particular vision of God...They tend to be very bad<br>
with statistics, too.<br>
<p>
The book was quite a bit different. There was a team of travelers, no<br>
terrorists, no second machine, and the group was sequestered after their<br>
return for fear of what they would tell the world. I guess since Carl Sagan<br>
was dead, they had greater 'artistic license'...<br>
