 IAN: Why is reality fuzzy? It is what it is. Reality is reality.<br>
 Our concepts (such as the photon should go through slit 1 or 2) <br>
 seek to model reality, however, reality does not seek to model <br>
 our concepts. Therefore, the physical reality is the "winner" <br>
 in the contest over which is 100% truth. The fuzziness lies<br>
 in the mismatch between concepts and the physical reality.<br>
 If the photon goes through both slits, that is 100% true.<br>
