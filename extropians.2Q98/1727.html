<i>&gt; However, most of my distractions are internal.  My mind</i><br>

Maybe you could use symbols or markers to denote your mode? "Thinking<br>
hats" so to say. When you are working on music, put a bust of<br>
Beethoven on your desk. When you switch to mathematics exchange it for<br>
a bust of Newton instead, and so on. The presence of the marker will<br>
remind you about what mode you should be in.<br>

<i>&gt; Meditation seems to me as something I should try, but my first look into</i><br>

<i>&gt; which I'm not concerned with.  I just want to think more clearly and with</i><br>
<i>&gt; greater focus.</i><br>
<p>
I think much of what is called meditation is just a fancy form of<br>
sitting around relaxing and thinking, either concentrated on a single<br>
task or trying to let the various mental subprocesses calm down. I<br>
think that can be learned without much teaching, but it requires<br>
plenty of training anyway.<br>
