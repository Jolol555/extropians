<i>&gt; From:          PaR &lt;par@nu-world.com&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; However the problem with the no absolute morals/ethics statement is that it leads to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the innevitable "so you believe that anyone can do anything to anyone else - plunder, </i><br>
<i>&gt; murder, rape etc.!!" </i><br>
<p>
It is not necessary to believe "rape is wrong" in order to have a <br>
compelling reason not to commit rape.  It is sufficient to believe <br>
"if I rape this girl, her brothers/sisters/friends/neighbors will <br>
find out who did it and come beat my head in".<br>
<p>
For those who hold the former belief, committing rape would simply <br>
produce a moral problem.  There are abundant cases of people finding <br>
their way out of moral problems in a manner that leaves them free of <br>
self-blame for incredible crimes.<br>
<p>
For those who hold the latter belief, committing rape would be a form <br>
of suicide.<br>
