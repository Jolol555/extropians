  IAN: Here are some images of one of the pyramids seen<br>
  from the Viking mission (the first is a 3Dized image):<br>

<i>&gt; Oddly, it looks a lot like a bunch of rocks.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Well, what if one or both of the pyramids were<br>
  not like "a bunch of rocks" but were perfectly formed,<br>
  or about 95% perfect, would that alter the possibility<br>
  that they were not of natural origin? Well they ARE both<br>
  about 95% perfectly formed 5-sided pyramids.  There are <br>
  other formations in the area, however, that are pyramid <br>
  like, yet do appear natural, so it could be some freak<br>
  geological formations. Or maybe the others are badly<br>
  eroded Martian-made structure 10,000,000 years old.?<br>
<p>
  That fact that so many symmetrically converging straight <br>
  lines and angles appear in one area is simply noteworthy.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;You know, when I predicted this face denial a few weeks ago I really didn't</i><br>

<i>&gt;bizarre... </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: But Dr. Mark J. Carlotto, a scientist who has<br>
   done more research on the face than probably anyone <br>
   alive, is not bizarre at all. He has published many <br>
   articles on the face in leading scientific journals.<br>
   <br>
   Here's his page: <a href="http://www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html">http://www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html</a> <br>
<p>
   I think that the many perfectly straight lines around <br>
   the base of the face are remarkable in and of themselves.<br>
   The best case against the face is that there are other<br>
   objects in the area, clearly nature, also have similar<br>
   unique features. But that is all certainly interesting<br>
   from a geological stand point if not an ET standpoint.<br>
