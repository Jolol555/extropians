<p>
I apologize in advance for my naivete, and also for perhaps going<br>
off-topic.<br>
<p>
	Something that has always puzzled me about Marxism... whence the<br>
_need_ for this thesis-antithesis-synthesis junk? I mean, as long as<br>
they're talking about collectivizing and redistributing the means of<br>
production, the what, why, and how of their ideology is coherent enough to<br>
agree or disagree with. What did they hope to accomplish by tying their<br>
straightforward core meme to shaky generalizations about history,<br>
determinism, and the nature of contradiction? Did the peasants and factory<br>
workers bust out cheering every time Vladimir Ilyich launched into his<br>
quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes speech, or what?<br>
	For that matter, to me the thesis-antithesis doctrine begs the<br>
question:  "won't the opposites of communism and capitalism therefore<br>
synthesize into a mixed-market economy?". Another vulnerability they've<br>
introduced into their ideology for no reason I can see is the assertion<br>
that the victory of communism is an inevitable culmination of unstoppable<br>
historical forces... BUT as soon as communism wins history will come to a<br>
screeching halt and nothing further will ever evolve. Now certainly nukes<br>
made that a distinct possibility toward the end, but I don't think that's<br>
what Marx meant. <br>
	In short, can someone please explain what the dialectic<br>
materialism meme had to do with the "workers of the world unite" meme? <br>
<p>
                                            --Sincerely, Alex F. Bokov<br>
