Another thing that I am wondering is if cryonics patients are wealthy ?  Is<br>
there any data on this that can be released without jeopardizing doctor-patient<br>
confidentiality (which I believe should apply)<br>
<p>
If it turns out that the average cryonics patient could actually afford to pay a<br>
lot more, here is a strategy that might allow capitalism to give us a helping<br>
hand;<br>
<p>
1)  Instead of $100k for suspension, we make the client pay $1M.<br>
2)  Where possible, 9 other people who have medical similarities to the client<br>
but cannot afford suspension will be offered cryonic suspension for free.<br>
<p>
Done properly, we'd pick 9 people who die before the client and are suspended.<br>
Similarly when the day comes to re-animate we'd do it by FIFO.  You can see the<br>
obvious commercial appeal of this to the client who put up the $1M as he can be<br>
sure that the procedure is being done in the best possible way in both<br>
directions !  Similarities in medical condition + storage technique gives our<br>
paying customer an edge.<br>
<p>
For every 100 rich dudes who got suspended, the cryonics industry would freeze<br>
1000 people.  This would lead to much more rapid advancement in the field as I<br>
think one of the biggest things holding it back at the moment is the lack of<br>
numbers.  As a marketing idea it is very powerful but caution should be taken.<br>
Lets not have images of a cryonicist walking through a public hospital calling<br>
for poor volunteers with liver damage !<br>
<p>
Would a company that offered this service actually attract *more* clients<br>
because of the more personal guarantee that they provide to the people who put<br>
up the money ?<br>
<p>
As for the volunteers who get it for nothing, well, TANSTAAFL !!<br>
