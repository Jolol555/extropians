<i>&gt; Yes - funny, stylish and deft.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; ouch-making.</i><br>
<p>
It reminded me of that saying people tend to abuse around here, "don't<br>
be so open minded that your brains fall out."  You can form words into<br>
pretty sentences, but do they mean anything?  Just the same, you can<br>
be funny and make a point but it doesn't make that point valid.  Oh! <br>
Shit I'm being too rational (but not so rational &lt;insert pointless,<br>
but oh so clever, remark here&gt;).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been wondering about this paradox</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself.  Despite having been an sf</i><br>
<i>&gt; writer by profession for, um, 35</i><br>
<i>&gt; years, I'm clearly `Imagination</i><br>
<i>&gt; Deficient'.  Part of this is what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would justify as `Dick-Headedness</i><br>
<i>&gt; -Intolerant', but part is quite close</i><br>
<i>&gt; to what Quinne's spoof parametrizes.</i><br>
<p>
And why, pray tell, do you want to be more 'imaginative'?  It's easy<br>
to make a funny remark and have people believe it's valid simply<br>
because it makes some clever observations.  It's not so easy to say<br>
something that truly is valid.<br>
<p>
When someone makes a witty and "biting" remark so clearly aimed in<br>
your direction there are two responses; A) retaliation - making some<br>
other equally witty remark to keep face, or B) defence, agreeing that<br>
you fit snugly into their social rut and then extrapolating to perhaps<br>
why you do it.  You managed to fall into the latter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Example: I can cautiously consider the</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility that certain claims of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; paranormal are valid without my head</i><br>
<i>&gt; exploding, but I get very, very angry</i><br>
<i>&gt; when my sister-in-law blithely reports</i><br>
<i>&gt; that she and her friends can change</i><br>
<i>&gt; the traffic lights green when they</i><br>
<i>&gt; wish to.  </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure I understand this.  Do you want to believe your<br>
sister-in-law? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It occurred to me that I (a first</i><br>
<i>&gt; born) have a high probability - on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sulloway's acount - of being narrow,</i><br>
<i>&gt; conservative and opposed to change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My brother Mick, 15 years younger and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the family's `baby', should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; turned out neophilic and radical - as</i><br>
<i>&gt; indeed he did, in a relaxed and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sardonic way (he's a scathing</i><br>
<i>&gt; authority on nuclear tropes in movies</i><br>
<i>&gt; and TV). </i><br>
<p>
Well I'm the last of three; I'll let you decide whether I fit neatly<br>
into your model.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; But I sort of muddy the picture, being</i><br>
<i>&gt; gung-ho for change in some directions</i><br>
<i>&gt; and quite narrow and hostile to</i><br>
<i>&gt; innovation in many others.</i><br>
<p>
Again I find you trying to fit yourself into someone else's rut (no,<br>
Damien, don't do it!).  Being "gung-ho for change" when you should be<br>
"narrow, conservative, and opposed to change" isn't "sort of muddying<br>
the picture" it's wiping your arse on it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I'm one of those people who find it</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard to believe anyone except the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mentally infirm would choose to wear a</i><br>
<i>&gt; baseball hat backwards - it mimics</i><br>
<i>&gt; baldness, never a good look, it leaves</i><br>
<i>&gt; you with the sun in your eyes, not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of fun, and it's a marker of herd</i><br>
<i>&gt; mentality.)  </i><br>
<p>
Today's youth tend walk with their heads hung low; thus the backs of<br>
their necks are more prone to sunburn.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suspect this might have something to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do with anxiety control.   If your</i><br>
<i>&gt; stress set-points are low, from birth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you might arrange your reactions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world in a defensive, suspicious</i><br>
<i>&gt; way, and if you're intelligent as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well, you might do this by</i><br>
<i>&gt; constructing/adopting highly complex,</i><br>
<i>&gt; organised systems of categorisation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluation and expression.  More</i><br>
<i>&gt; relaxed people might find it easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; break free, to explore `imaginatively'</i><br>
<i>&gt; without the risk of premature closure.</i><br>
<p>
You could have a point, I'm relaxed to the point of near-death and<br>
IMHO I'm "open-minded" (i.e. I don't suffer from premature closure,<br>
well, maybe once or twice but you know what it's like when you get<br>
excited!).  And personally, I wouldn't say that a SF writer with<br>
extensive knowledge of all things psi is prone to premature closure<br>
either.<br>
