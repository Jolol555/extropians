Damien Broderick wrote 4/13/98: &lt;Black holes evaporate when the external<br>
temperature is *lower* than that of the hole, not higher.<br>
<p>
This discussion seems wrong-headed anyway, because the canonical view of<br>
Hawking radiation is that it's due to the infall of one half of a virtual<br>
particle pair ripped out of the vacuum beyond the hole, and the slingshot<br>
escape of the other.  Positive energy is *not* tunnelling out of the hole,<br>
negative energy is being imported into it.  I can imagine that this is the<br>
kind of claim that will set Reilly's teeth on edge...&gt;<br>
<p>
There is something here that sets my teeth on edge.  Black holes with less<br>
mass evaporate because their temperature is greater than the background<br>
temperature, black holes with more mass accrete because their temperature<br>
is less than the background temperature.  Now, when we have a black hole<br>
with sufficient mass to achieve a temperature a hair more than the<br>
background temperature, it is evaporating.  As a gedanken experiment, let's<br>
dribble itsy bitsy bits of matter towards this black hole and watch what<br>
happens at the event horizon Planck moment by Planck moment.  We are<br>
carefully cooling the black hole until, at a given Planck moment,<br>
equilibrium is reached with the background temperature.  At the very next<br>
Planck moment - Poof! - the black hole is now cooler than the background<br>
and begins to accrete even after we immediately turn off the dribble of<br>
matter.  In one instant, the black hole turns from an everyday ordinary<br>
melting ice cube into a refrigerator powerful enough to suck in every bit<br>
of matter and energy that drifts by it, to suck in the whole universe if we<br>
could maneuver it into the black hole's vicinity.  The only way out of the<br>
eternal mega-refrigerator scenario is to wait for the death-worshipper's<br>
ultimate paradise - the heat death of the universe.  I just don't feel<br>
comfortable with this.<br>
<p>
The surface of the event horizon in such a scenario seems to me to be quite<br>
complex.  Aside from tidal forces of rotation, which breaks the spherical<br>
geometry of the surface and creates complex mixing patterns, there should<br>
be peaks and valleys at the surface due to the underlying distribution of<br>
matter inside the black hole and due to quantum fluctuations.  The surface<br>
should be roiling like a flag blowing in the wind.  Evaporation would occur<br>
at the peaks from the tangential shear from incoming particles and<br>
accretion would occur in the valleys.  I am uncertain of the full nature of<br>
particle interactions in such a scenario, but my intuition says that as the<br>
peaks are sheared away in evaporation, the valleys temporarily are more<br>
open to accretion in a see-saw action.  The canonical interpretation says<br>
that the greater the event horizon is relative to the mass inside, the more<br>
peaks control the action and vice versa.  But I not sure if the true<br>
dynamics at the surface of larger masses tip the scale to the valleys.  I<br>
am not certain that the thickness of the region where particles interact at<br>
the event horizon is constant regardless of the mass of the black hole,<br>
even though this is one of the underlying assumptions of the canonical<br>
interpretation.  In any event, thanks for the response.<br>

John Clark wrote 4/14/98: &lt;If you define a vacuum far from any object as<br>
having zero pressure and if the vacuum can still push the plates together<br>
then the space between the plates  must have negative pressure. According<br>
to Einstein, mass is not the only  thing that can warp space and time, that<br>
is, create gravity, pressure can too, although this only becomes important<br>
when the pressure is VERY high, like  inside a Neutron star. New theory<br>
says negative pressure should do  interesting things to time and space<br>
also, just like positive pressure, but  this part has not been confirmed<br>
experimentally because the effect is so tiny. <br>
<p>
An observer's clock between the plates will (probably) run a little fast<br>
and  for an observer outside the plates distances would (probably) expand a<br>
little.  Since speed is distance divided by time nobody sees a change in<br>
the speed of  light. This negative pressure idea is a little similar to the<br>
old cosmological constant idea of Einstein, he later said that was the<br>
worst mistake of his  life, but maybe not, it may play an important part in<br>
the  evolution of the  universe.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is lucid and interesting to me.  John, I can't figure out why, after<br>
publicly announcing that you think I and half my state should be<br>
guillotined because we don't want to turn our doctors into murderers of the<br>
old and sick, you still try to help me out, which, in fact, you do.  Why<br>
are you helping me if you think my shoulders should be relieved of my head?<br>
<p>
I am wedded to the cosmological constant because of my physical conception<br>
of substance, of how gravity physically works, of the phenomenal continuum<br>
between gravity and consciousness, only I am unsure if the "constant" is an<br>
average constant, with local variability, or is an absolute constant.  I<br>
also may be confusing aspects of the cosmological constant with the<br>
location and quantum effects of negative energy.  I am, ahem, uncertain.<br>
<p>
As an aside, since you're being helpful, I'll apologize for my reference to<br>
"Kuhnian paradigms," I was just being irritating, rather out of character<br>
for me.  Thomas Kuhn was a no-good relativist, pah!<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;The question was not whether the Big Bang is true or not but weather<br>
it's a scientific theory or not, you said it was not but the only reason<br>
given is that you just don't like it. If you have other reasons I'd like to<br>
hear them.&gt;<br>
<p>
Earlier, you wrote your idea of what constitutes a scientific theory: "Any<br>
theory that makes predictions and can in principle be proven wrong is<br>
Science."  Now, I don't want to get into something I've exhaustively posted<br>
on previously, but Popperian falsifiability is itself false, as I have<br>
explained in detail.  The truth about scientific theory is that it<br>
logically *must* be equally falsifiable as verifiable, again as previously<br>
posted.  Verifiability comes when the words of scientific theory are<br>
actualized in physical reality.  This is why there is no boundary between<br>
technology and science.  Now, as to why the Big Bang is not science, it is<br>
because physicists claim:<br>
<p>
a) energy cannot be created from nothing and<br>
<p>
b) energy was created from nothing.<br>
<p>
This looks fishy to me.  Perhaps I don't have the relativist's useful<br>
emotional capacity for embracing contradiction.<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;A singularity is a point where an equation no longer works because<br>
values become infinite. There is absolutely no doubt that our equations do<br>
this at the center of a Black Hole, whether this fact has any physical<br>
significance remains to be seen.&gt;<br>
<p>
It only remains to be seen after we've completely melted a black hole.  In<br>
the meantime, I will continue to view the postulation of singularities<br>
physically existing inside black holes as kooky.  First reality, then math,<br>
not vice versa.<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;If you're not the greatest you're certainly the world's most certain<br>
expert, and on every subject under the sun. Unfortunately absolute <br>
certainty is a dime a dozen, being correct is not.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is a good example of the pot calling the kettle black.  If your<br>
fixation on information as an ontological primitive, your "everything is<br>
digital" worldview, isn't as hardcore a certainty as any expression of<br>
religious dogmatism I've seen, then I don't know what is.  I'm certain of<br>
that.  I'm also certain that it's a delusional worldview that proceeds from<br>
its metaphysical premises to the political consequences of guillotines<br>
working overtime.<br>
