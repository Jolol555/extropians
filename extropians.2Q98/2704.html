&lt;&lt;Noticed your admonishment regarding insulting someone who simply disagreed<br>
with you...Wondered about it in light of this post.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
You're absolutely correct.  The post was done in a rush, and as such missed my<br>
normal editing. I apologize.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Anyway.  You seem to have attributed a great many traits to me after having<br>
read that post.  I'm not at all sure of how to disabuse you of them.  I don't<br>
feel "superior to god ". I don't think any such being exists to feel superior<br>
to.  I don't want god to fix everything just for me.  But could you please<br>
explain to me what function AIDS, or tuberculosis, or take your pick,, have in<br>
perpetuating free will?  Why does it have to be all or nothing? You claim that<br>
I seem to want a perfect world.  I never said any such thing. I simply<br>
wondered, in the context of the thread regarding reconciliation of an<br>
omnipotent/ominbenevolent god with the existence of evil.  I equated the<br>
existence of such things as disease with a seeming willingness on the part of<br>
this god to create hardship for no apparent reason.  Is cancer somehow a<br>
neccesary penalty to suffer for the gift of freewill?  I can't believe any<br>
such thing.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
To simplify:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;1) I don't believe that this god being exists.<br>
<p>
2) If such a being exists, the evidence available to me suggests that<br>
he/she/it is at best uncaring and at worst remarkably cruel.  In either case I<br>
don't care to have anything to do with he/she/it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I have no problem with the idea that god does not exist.  I have no evidence<br>
either way.  I disagree with the idea that if such a being does exist, he must<br>
be one cruel bastard because people suffer.  As I stated earlier, most of the<br>
forces that imperil us, such as AIDS, are products of the same scientific laws<br>
that allowed us to evolve into sapient beings in the first place, and to<br>
create a civilization in the second.  To say that God  is either uncaring or<br>
sadistic because people die in airplanes is to say that the creation of<br>
airplanes is in itself an evil thing.  To say that God must be cruel because<br>
people die of ebola is to disregard the fact that the same process that<br>
produced ebola produced us.  On of the tenets of deism/theism is that god<br>
created the natural laws of the universe, and stood back from there.  To<br>
interfer with those laws once they had started running would be to destroy the<br>
independence of that creation.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Have a lovely day,<br>
