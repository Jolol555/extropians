<i>&gt;I have a feeling this is done for endangered plants, except that</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of freezing the plants are grown in a large</i><br>
<i>&gt;endangered-plant farm.  I think this is an important initiative:</i><br>
<i>&gt;just compare the number of types of apple (probably around 100),</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the number of types that exist at your local grocery (probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;no more than 4).  The other apples are not getting used since they</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't keep as well-- if they were not grown they would disappear</i><br>
<i>&gt;forever, which would be a very silly mistake.  How hard do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;think it would be to sell a bunch of health-conscious,</i><br>
<i>&gt;enviro-friendly, trendy yuppies some short-keeping specialty</i><br>
<i>&gt;apples?  It would be tragic to miss a business opportunity like</i><br>
<i>&gt;that because no one though to freeze a few seeds.</i><br>
<p>
Actually there are thousands of types of apples and most other<br>
common food plants, there are tens of thousands of rice varieties<br>
for example.<br>
<p>
The good news is that we are revisiting a topic discussed here<br>
before, but I shall briefly recapitulate.<br>
<p>
In the early 70's a group of amateur gardeners all concerned with<br>
the disappearing variety's of favorite fruits and vegetables, and<br>
the dwindling number of seed companies, began seeking out lost<br>
varietys and each other to form what is known as "Heirloom<br>
Gardening" (because varietys were handed down generation to<br>
generation) This started largely with a man who noticed the<br>
dwindling supplies (around the 1920's)and single-handedly preserved<br>
over a thousand varieties of beans (most seeds need to be grown<br>
every three years or so) this has grown into a worldwide movement<br>
and new seed companies are emerging all the time. One of my<br>
favorites is "Seeds Of Change". At the same time Cambell's is<br>
creating the "flavorsavor" these people have brought back the<br>
Brandywine (awesome). These companies all produce "open-pollinated"<br>
seeds. Not only have they saved thousand's of old varietys, but<br>
they are creating new ones.<br>
<p>
New restaurants and some not so new (Chez Pannisse) are the driving<br>
forces.<br>
<p>
Seeds of change is also the name of a book on this movement.<br>
<p>
Good news......<br>
