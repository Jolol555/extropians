<i>&gt; &gt; 1) Is there a single field which is intrinsically safe from automation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the course of the next 20-30 years?  If you can think of more fields,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; please elaborate.</i><br>
<p>
All of the fields you mentioned below make up less than 5% of the populace.<br>
Even if you were correct, it still would leave the remaining 95% unemployed.<br>
But even still, most of the jobs you mention can or already are becoming<br>
automated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; a: Jerry Springer Show guests ;)</i><br>
<p>
Can't argue with this one! :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; b: writers</i><br>
<p>
This is debatable.  I once read a rather interesting but somewhat incoherent<br>
story, which I later found out was created by a computer program running on a<br>
486.  I have a friend who is working on interactive fiction software at Carnegie<br>
Mellon.  As computer power increases and interactive heuristics improve, more<br>
and more people will be reading and playing in complex fictional environments<br>
without the need of an author.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; c: artists</i><br>
<p>
See above.  Although anyone can always contribute in this area. We need all the<br>
art we can get.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; d: scientific researchers</i><br>
<p>
A lot of things that were called science several decades ago are now completely<br>
automated with advance computer software.  With increasing power and software<br>
sophistication, software inches closer to becoming our collaborators rather than<br>
just our tools.  According to Hans Moravec, human-level AI will be reached in<br>
the 20-30 year timeframe.  At such a point, super-AI could exceed humans in<br>
almost any scientific enterprise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; e: explorers</i><br>
<p>
Much of this is already automated.  Orbital reconasaince satellites, underwater<br>
rovers, and most especially robotic space probes.  Despite the fact that 'I'<br>
want to go to space, it is much cheaper to send a robot to explore the deep<br>
reaches than to send a human.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; f: colonizers</i><br>
<p>
Since when is moving to a new location a job?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; g: politicians</i><br>
<p>
hehehe.  And you call yourself an extropian - shame on you! :-)<br>
<p>
Politicians are the most easily automated of all.  If we have ubiquitous<br>
internet access, everyone can vote as much or as little as they like, depending<br>
on how important a specific issue is to them.  Electronic voting heralds a move<br>
from representational to participatory democracy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; h: lawyers</i><br>
<p>
Most lawyers are contract lawyers of one kind or another.  Contract *law*<br>
becomes superfluous when you can circumvent the need for such laws with Smart<br>
Contracts. The advent of smart contracts (see<br>
<a href="http://www.best.com/~szabo/smart_contracts_2.html">http://www.best.com/~szabo/smart_contracts_2.html</a>) will render the majority of<br>
lawyers useless.  Who needs a lawyer when you can use cryptography and digital<br>
reputations for secure transactions?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; i: plaintiffs</i><br>
<p>
see above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; j: teachers</i><br>
<p>
Most people I know learn more on their own than from most teachers.  As the<br>
internet becomes more pervasive, anyone and everyone becomes a potential<br>
teacher.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; k: strippers</i><br>
<p>
Virtual Reality is catching up quick.  Before too long, prostitutes will become<br>
an expensive alternative to sophisticated teledildonics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; l: robot maintenance</i><br>
<p>
Yes, for a while at least.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2) Are these remaining fields if any, sufficient to employ the majority</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of humanity?  If not, what will the rest of humanity do in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; survive?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; have fun? explore new worlds? maintain the machines?</i><br>
<p>
This assumes that they already have the means to survive.  You cant have fun if<br>
your dead.  From where will they get their income?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 3)  For those who are unemployed and do not have sufficient investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; income, is death the inevitable result?  If not, how will they survive?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; considering that the more free and capitalistic a society is, the more it</i><br>
<i>&gt; tends to privately fund charitable organizations, and recruit volunteers for</i><br>
<i>&gt; charitable organizaitons,  then a future economy should free people up to</i><br>
<i>&gt; help improve the lives of others through volunteer organizations. I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that education will be the great growth industry along with mind network</i><br>
<i>&gt; interfacing.</i><br>
<p>
I hope your right here. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; you have no idea, nor do I of the sort of economic trends that have yet to</i><br>
<i>&gt; even start, but will be branched off from the technologies we can currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceptualize. It is too soon to tell.  However, based on past history, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather optimistic.</i><br>
<p>
Your right, I have no idea.  That's why I was hoping some of the more<br>
economically adept could enlighten me as to how the transition to a fully<br>
automated economy would not render the majority of the workforce obsolete<br>
without them having a means to continue prospering.<br>
<p>
Thanks Michael for a very entertaining post!  :-)<br>
