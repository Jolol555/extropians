<i>&gt; No, you missed the point of that part of the article.  The author didn't mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; track as in note when and where you used your government ID card (since the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government would OF COURSE be aware of when and where you used it, presumably,</i><br>
<i>&gt; excluding the use of it for entrance into clubs or such) but meant that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government could actually track your movements even when you didn't use it.</i><br>
<p>
Given smart card technology, this too will become possible. I happen to know one<br>
of the pioneers in this technology, he founded Automated Payment Systems, Inc., in<br>
Seattle. The systems they sold were primarily for use in parking and subway/bus<br>
system payments, but the technology is easily transferrable to everyday use for<br>
all financial transactions, and in its present form can be used for tracking<br>
people through public spaces. These cards have a chip in them, and a small radio<br>
transmitter. Unlike some other systems that you need to swipe your card through,<br>
these cards have a range of several feet, such that you could have your parking<br>
card in your wallet, drive through the turnstile, and be charged without ever<br>
taking out your wallet. This technology will be easily usable for tracking with<br>
the wide installation of sensors  that can interface with this card. Not only<br>
could such technology be used for tracking you, but if you are deemed a threat to<br>
public safety, the powers that be could easily seize the financial assets in your<br>
card's chip, making you helpless and easily picked up...<br>
<p>
Fortunately, my freind was also working on card technology he calls a 'ghost'<br>
card, that allows you to pass through undetected....<br>
