Governments exist primarily because historically centralization has been<br>
more efficient and required to defeat other invading governments. With<br>
current weaponry and communications technologies this is no longer the<br>
case; in fact government centralization is a weakness when the entire<br>
US government could be wiped out by one fanatic with a van-nuke. Hence<br>
increasing government paranoia, which serves only to increase the <br>
probability that the White House will move to the stratosphere.<br>
<p>
Criminal organisations generally exist because of bad laws; remove<br>
victimless crime laws and most of them would have no way to make money<br>
other than direct use of force. Sadly, the generation who learnt their<br>
lesson with prohibition were dying out by the arrival of the 'War on <br>
Some Drugs'.<br>
