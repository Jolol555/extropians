<p>
first of all, he wouldn't have to spend all his money.  He earns more per<br>
unit time than those 10000000 Indians combined, so he would just have to<br>
spend a couple of months until the indians run out of funds.  Second of<br>
all, even if someone did have to spend all his money (say a lesser god,<br>
like rupert murdoch or ted turner), that is still way too much power to<br>
give to one person.  Most of the psychotic dictators around the world<br>
didn't get anywhere near that figure (arguably only three ever made it<br>
there, counting side effects and other stuff)<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Other PPAs.  If your PPA decides to get tyrannical, you decide to stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; paying them for protection and instead pay another PPA (who will gladly</i><br>
<i>&gt; accept your funds) to protect you against your current PPA.  If your</i><br>
<i>&gt; current PPA is really being tyrannical, then lots of people will favor this</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategy and the tyrannical PPA will be out of funding.  They may still try</i><br>
<i>&gt; to wage war, and lose even more money, until eventually they'll be out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; business.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
That is if your PPA lets you decide where your money is<br>
going to go.  I think the analogy with the nation state is pretty useful.<br>
you could fund another nation, (a la cubans in the US), but only if that<br>
other nation is more powerful than your current one.  And that does not<br>
guarantee that your new PPA won't do the same thing, even though it <br>
might not be to the same degree (again, a la cubans in<br>
the US).<br>
