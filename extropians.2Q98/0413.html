I don't see why you're uncomfortable with this.  It won't suck the whole<br>
universe in because you *can't* maneuver it into the black hole's vicinity.<br>
Furthermore, if the universe is open, then it (the U.) will expand until<br>
it's temperature is lower than the BH's, at which point the BH will again<br>
start to evaporate.  (This could even happen if the U. is not open, but<br>
expands for a sufficiently long time.)  And since the U. is expanding, it<br>
gets harder and harder to maneuver stuff into the BH's vicinity, since<br>
things are getting further and further apart.  And if the U. is closed<br>
tightly enough that it starts to contract before it gets cool enough to<br>
cause the BH to start evaporating, then it will collapse long before<br>
the BH has any chance to gobble everything up --- except during the last<br>
instance, when all the BH's in the universe get close enough to touch,<br>
merge, and swallow everything up just before the universal singularity.<br>
(In fact, I'm not enough of a GR expert to say if this will happen;<br>
perhaps some matter/energy will remain outside BH's right down to the<br>
last Planck moment before the collapsed universal singularity.)<br>
<p>
So, what exactly is it that makes your teeth uncomfortable?<br>
