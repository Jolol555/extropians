<i>&gt; &gt; Actually, the universe doesn't have to be very smart. Novikov makes a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; careful analysis of the action principle on a billiard table with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; time-travel wormhole and a single billiard ball. In quantum mechanics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it turns out that the wavefunction for the inconsistent solutions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; becomes identically zero, while some weird but consistent solutions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; involving the billiard ball having interactions with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; itself-from-the-future becomes possible. So the inconsistent stuff</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doesn't happen, just weird but consistent stuff. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a dramatic use of this in Robert Forward's novel Timemaster.</i><br>
<p>
His use is essentially Novikov's billiard ball trick:<br>
<p>
Place the backwards-in-time-wormhole ends like this (anything that<br>
enters the entrance appears one second earlier at the exit). Send a<br>
billiard ball towards the entrance:<br>
                                                                <br>
                                                                <br>
       Billiard ball                         # <br>
-----------------------------------------&gt;   # Entrance to wormhole       <br>
                                    A        #                  <br>
<i>                                    |                           </i><br>
<i>                                    |                           </i><br>
                                 ###### Wormhole exit           <br>
<p>
If you give it the right velocity, a future version of itself will<br>
appear at the exit one second before it enters, and move forward to<br>
block it from entering. PARADOX!!!<br>
<p>
But Novikov shows that there is a consistent solution that the<br>
universe might use instead: one second before the ball enters the<br>
wormhole a ball emerges from the exit at a slanted angle, collides<br>
with the ball and sends it into the entrance at an angle. This way the<br>
universe remains consistent, momentum is conserved (OK, there are some<br>
tricky considerations when you use wormholes to turn the momentum<br>
vector about) and we avoid paradoxes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I still say that it is black magic.  Once you start up one of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; Novikov collisions, you won't be able to interfere.  The whole path is</i><br>
<i>&gt; pre-ordained.  Any universes where you succeed get nulled out.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I think it is more clever than that. Agents still have their<br>
free will, it is just that they or the world will not behave in such a<br>
way that a paradox results.  Suppose you were trying to make a paradox<br>
on the Novikov table by shoving the ball around. When you are planning<br>
to snatch any balls emerging from the exit and throw them into the<br>
wastebasket, none will appear.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Remember Asimov's short story about the crystals which dissolve *before*</i><br>
<i>&gt; you add water?  The military used them to create a bomb by using a cascade</i><br>
<i>&gt; of stages to expand the time interval.  Once a crystal dissolved there</i><br>
<i>&gt; *had* to be ("had been") water added in a few hours.  Drop the bomb in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; heavily sealed case in an enemy country, and a bizarre, damaging typhoon</i><br>
<i>&gt; would arise sufficient to bash open the bomb, along with everything else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not contradictory or inconsistent, but paradoxical in my book.</i><br>
