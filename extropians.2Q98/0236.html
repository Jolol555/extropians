<i>&gt;Yes, thats true in our time. But there are people in this world who work  </i><br>

<p>
If it's illegal, then I have proven my claim that "once your direct<br>
democracy has made a decision, it has to force its operations on the<br>
minority who disapprove."  The fact that people have to WORK in order to<br>
CAUSE it to be legal to do this is proof that majority-level democracy is<br>
not what you claim.<br>
<p>
Your "new land" claim made sense back when there was new land to go to...<br>
however, the only area currently which (to my knowledge) has no government<br>
is Antarctica, and IMO the costs of living there are far too great to<br>
outweigh the privledges this would allow me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; And if my delegate misrepresents me?  See above.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Than all decisions are illegal because the groups have to acept voluntary  </i><br>
<i>&gt;the decisions of all delegates.</i><br>
<p>
Who are the groups?  And what if my delegate gets outvoted by a factious<br>
majority?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Plus, since both participants agree on the "vote" beforehand,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; they will almost never need to be forced to agree with themselves (except</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; when they change their minds after voting).  Now imagine people calling</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; these votes "contracts" and calling this system "the free market."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Okay, but I think there is a diffrent between a contract and a consensus  </i><br>
<i>&gt;decision. A consensus decision ends if the participant in this consensus  </i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot longer agree with this consensus. But a contract is a peace of pa- </i><br>
<i>&gt;per who can force you to agree with yourself and your old decision if you  </i><br>
<i>&gt;have mutual agreed in a time sequence where you are obligated by the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;contract.</i><br>
<p>
This is true at the moment, but again, this is only in the case where<br>
people change their minds and try to violate contracts which they have<br>
already made.  The majority of contracts, however, are fulfilled without a<br>
hitch, without force nor threat of force because both parties agree to its<br>
terms.  And smart contracts and other similar systems may well be able to<br>
obviate the use of force in contracts altogether in the near future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; So they are competetive.  Fortunately, in the case of companies, they're</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; competing to see who can perform the services which are worth the most to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the most people... note that each and every buyer co-operates voluntarily</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; when they buy goods, and that the company which performs services which are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not worth enough to enough buyers eventually goes out of business.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see, you havn't had thought about it.</i><br>
<p>
You couldn't possibly see this.  Don't make presumptions about what I'm<br>
thinking.  ("Unless otherwise specified, I'm not telling you everything I<br>
know.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I havn't told from competetion. I  </i><br>
<i>&gt;have asked if you noticed the inner structure of industrial companies to  </i><br>
<i>&gt;make decisions and not their relationship to buyers/customers.</i><br>
<p>
What?  That they're hierarchical?  Yes, I had noticed this.  This is<br>
because they are in competition.  However, they differ in their essense for<br>
the reasons I just got through telling you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;See above. Therefore this statement is wrong. Workers and their managment  </i><br>
<i>&gt;inside the industrial world are forced to co-operate: the managment have  </i><br>
<i>&gt;to co-operate with their workers because they cannot produce without wor-  </i><br>
<i>&gt;kers and the workers have to co-operate with the managment, because they  </i><br>
<i>&gt;need their wages to survive and therefore they have to acept that the ma-  </i><br>
<i>&gt;nagment have command of their work.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, the Marxist fallacy: that the workers cannot survive without the firm's<br>
wages.<br>
<p>
I know you're probably opposed to the very idea, but try reading an<br>
introductory neo-classical microeconomics textbook.  (It's important to<br>
understand the language of your enemy.  ;)  Hell, I've read _Capital_.)<br>
<p>
Anyway, this theory of labor would be true if, and only if, the firm could<br>
offer any wages it wanted.  This is not the case however, and would be true<br>
if, and only if, it were the only buyer of labor (a monopsony).  You see,<br>
when firms are in competition, workers will tend to apply for jobs which<br>
offer higher wages.  As a result, a firm which offers higher wages can<br>
afford higher quality workers, and offer a better product.  In theoretical<br>
"perfect competition," firms cannot set wages at all, but rather must<br>
accept the market price: by setting wages any higher, they wouldn't make<br>
any money, and by setting them any lower, they wouldn't have any workers.<br>
<p>
When there is only ONE buyer of labor, however, the firm has complete<br>
freedom to set the price of labor to be whatever it wants, which workers<br>
must accept because there is no one else to whom they can sell labor.  This<br>
is how Marx viewed the labor market, and it is clearly wrong, which we can<br>
observe empirically: there are MANY different firms out there, each<br>
offering different wages and producing goods of different quality.<br>
<p>
Even under a monopsony, however, workers can increase their wages through<br>
investment; in this case, strikes.  In this form of wage investment,<br>
workers forego today's earnings in exchange for an increase in wages from a<br>
firm; this can even take place under a monopsony.  Marx presumed that this<br>
would be impossible because the proletariat are property-less (or nearly<br>
so) and therefore too destitute to survive a strike.<br>
<p>
But thanks to the competition which does exist, workers are NOT destitute,<br>
and do not depend entirely on one firm's wages to survive.  Using their own<br>
savings, (which Marx presumed would not exist under capitalism,) workers<br>
can and do successfully invest in their own wages by striking.  If the<br>
labor market looked as you suggest it does, then this would be totally<br>
impossible.<br>
<p>
Workers do not depend on a firm's wages for their living.  They can sell to<br>
other firms, and they can strike, and the firm cannot legally stop either<br>
of these from happening under l-f capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The structure of the military is as well hirarchically as the structure of  </i><br>
<i>&gt;the industry. Both have structures where competence and responsibility are  </i><br>
<i>&gt;split from the top to the bottom; the people on the top make the decisions  </i><br>
<i>&gt;and have a high responsibillity whereas the people at the bottom carry out  </i><br>
<i>&gt;orders with a low responsibillity; only the managment -- the industrial ge- </i><br>
<i>&gt;neral staff -- could change the production and the structure of the firm  </i><br>
<i>&gt;and have command of this structure of working.</i><br>
<p>
This is true; many have argued this is the best way to organize when you<br>
must compete against others.  I am unconvinced, but I do not specialize in<br>
this sort of thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Once the managment have made a decision, it have to force its operations</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;on the majority of workers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This is completely wrong.  Under capitalism, corporations can't (legally)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; force their employees to do anything.  All of the employees volunteer to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; work in a corporation.  All those who don't volunteer to do what the CEO</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wants don't have to work there at all.  How is this force?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Because workers and human beings like Bill Gates or Rockefeller are *not*  </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the same level. Rich people have enough money to build up a firm; there- </i><br>
<i>&gt;fore for them are to work for wage or to work for their own firms a real  </i><br>
<i>&gt;alternativ; but if you have to work for wage and must spend most of your  </i><br>
<i>&gt;wage for your survive you are not able to earn enough money to build up  </i><br>
<i>&gt;your own firm. Therefore you are forces to earn wage your hole life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Every costs of interests of all firms who produce, transport or sell a  </i><br>
<i>&gt;product are part of the price of this product. Every buyer of a product  </i><br>
<i>&gt;have to pay the price -- and all costs of interests inside. Rich people  </i><br>
<i>&gt;could invest there money and could earn this costs of interests back which  </i><br>
<i>&gt;they have to pay inside the prices -- or they earn more. But poor people  </i><br>
<i>&gt;who cann't invest their money because they need this money to survive can-  </i><br>
<i>&gt;not earn cost of interests back. Therefore they are not on the same level  </i><br>
<i>&gt;with the firm- and capital-owners. And therefore they cannot co-operate  </i><br>
<i>&gt;voluntary on the same level.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Therefore capitalism in its dayly reality</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;isn't much closer to "spontaneous order" than democracy.</i><br>
