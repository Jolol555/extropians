<i>&gt;             "First, we kill all the 11-year-olds..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Meaner than the mean kids who go on shooting sprees are the measures</i><br>
<i>&gt; adults are pursuing in the name of combating crime -- including proposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislation to execute preteens.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; BY ROBIN TEMPLETON | A series of high-profile school-site killings by</i><br>
<i>&gt; young boys -- including last week's shooting spree in a Springfield,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ore., high school cafeteria -- have precipitated a more predictable</i><br>
<i>&gt; horror: proposed legislation to try 10-year-olds as adults and apply the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  death penalty to 11-year-olds. It is as if a handful of problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; children -- "mean kids" we call them -- are absolving adults of having</i><br>
<i>&gt; to deal with the problems of children.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Current juvenile laws could not have anticipated violent crimes being</i><br>
<i>&gt; committed by children this young," explains Texas State Rep. Jim Pitts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; who is sponsoring the latest round of legislation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But it is Pitts' generation that warrants concern. For the past</i><br>
<i>&gt; quarter-century, aging baby boomers -- not children or teenagers -- have</i><br>
<i>&gt; driven the upsurge in violent crime. The FBI reports that arrest rates</i><br>
<i>&gt; for violent crime have doubled for 30- to 49-year-olds since 1975.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Homicide by children under 13 occurs less frequently today than in 1965.</i><br>
<p>
The FBI arrest rates only measure an average nationwide. Professor John Lott's<br>
analysis of FBI statistics from 1977 to 1996, which he originally worked on for<br>
a study sponsored by Handguns Control Inc., the primary anti-gun lobbying group<br>
(and which fired him when his conclusions directly contradicted their<br>
predetermined prejudices and propaganda needs), shows that there is a distinct<br>
difference in violent crime statistics between states that have passed<br>
right-to-carry concealed weapons laws, and states that have no-right-to-carry<br>
laws. In his expanded study for his new book: _More Guns, Less Crime_ he<br>
examined stats for all multiple death spree type shootings, and found that the<br>
rates for all such violent crimes have been trending downward, and in states<br>
which pass right-to-carry laws, they will experience an average of almost an 80%<br>
drop in such spree shootings within 5 years of passage of such laws in each<br>
state.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Texas is not a lone state. Long before Jonesboro, the governors of</i><br>
<i>&gt; California and New Mexico appealed in the name of victims of juvenile</i><br>
<i>&gt; crime for laws to lower their states' execution ages to 14 and 13,</i><br>
<i>&gt; respectively. On state and federal fronts, efforts are proliferating to</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentence children as adults, abolish the protective segregation of child</i><br>
<i>&gt; from adult inmates and limit parole for juvenile offenders. New Jersey</i><br>
<i>&gt; is deploying military-designed satellite technology to track juvenile</i><br>
<i>&gt; parolees cuffed with 8-pound transmitters. The head of the state's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Juvenile Justice Commission boasts that the system is like "Star Wars."</i><br>
<p>
Another interesting note is that Prof. Lott found that the death penalty has had<br>
little to no measurable impact on violent crime rates. Hmmmmm....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In short, the war on crime has become obsessed with young people -- but</i><br>
<i>&gt; as targets rather than victims, predators rather than prey. Which</i><br>
<i>&gt; shouldn't surprise young people. After all, children are far more apt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be murdered by adults -- including their own parents -- than the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; way around. "The only time people really pay attention to kids is if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; pick up a gun and blast somebody," a 16-year-old friend observed a week</i><br>
<i>&gt; after the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, Ark. Yet most young people</i><br>
<i>&gt; are more concerned about missing breakfast than dodging bullets. Some 12</i><br>
<i>&gt; million children are malnourished in America today, according to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Children's Defense Fund. The poverty rate of young people overall is 50</i><br>
<i>&gt; percent higher today than it was in 1970.</i><br>
<p>
The Children's Defense Fund is one of thos liberal PACs that erroneously<br>
categorize 'children'.  While Websters dictionary classifies a 'child' as a<br>
person in a prepubescent state, usually less than 14 years of age, liberal<br>
groups like CDF and HCI, in their propaganda, use stats for people of ages up to<br>
19 and even up to 25 years of age. That teen age girls may be malnourished due<br>
to peer pressure/self discipline or eating disorders associated with peer<br>
pressure is not taken into account in these stats.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Adults' response to all this would make Charles Dickens shudder: Since</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1970 we have cut back spending on education by at least 25 percent and</i><br>
<i>&gt; upped funding for incarceration by $3.2 billion. If the present rate of</i><br>
<i>&gt; incarceration continues, one out of every 20 children born in 1997 will</i><br>
<i>&gt; spend time behind bars. For males the figure will be one out of 11, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; for African-American males it will be one in four.</i><br>
<p>
We have been cutting back on the rate of increase in funding. Actual funding, in<br>
real dollar terms, when adjusted for inflation, has not dropped at all.<br>
<p>
Also, what is meant by the term 'time behind bars'? If you call spending a few<br>
hours behind bars while the bureaucracy finally figures out that the bail they<br>
say you are wanted on was actually paid, or that the fine they say you never<br>
paid was actually paid, is actually classifiable as 'hard time' then its obvious<br>
that a propaganda job is going on here. Additionally, at the rate that<br>
government is making more and more daily activities illegal, I can well imagine<br>
that within a few years a majority of the population being members of the<br>
'criminal' class.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The irony is that the generation of baby boomers backing these policies</i><br>
<i>&gt; grew up, by and large, distrusting adults. Today it is adults who</i><br>
<i>&gt; distrust the young. A Rand Corporation survey in 1996 found that</i><br>
<i>&gt; American adults believe juveniles cause 50 percent of violent crime. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; FBI, by contrast, reported that year that juveniles caused 10 to 15</i><br>
<i>&gt; percent of violent crime. Last March -- the same week that media</i><br>
<i>&gt; headlined the Jonesboro shootings -- the FBI reported a 30 percent drop</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the juvenile homicide rate over the past three years.</i><br>
<p>
The primary targets in this media campaign are not the children, but gun makers<br>
and dealers. The media ignores that these sort of shootings have been going on<br>
for years at a more or less constant rate. They are publicizing them now because<br>
they are prepping the population to support more gun restriction legislation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "I know what World War III will be -- a war against teenagers,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; predicted Emilio, 17, after watching "Twelve Monkeys," a film about</i><br>
<i>&gt; postapocalyptic dystopia. According to the National Criminal Justice</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission, spending on crime fighting is actually increasing three</i><br>
<i>&gt; times faster than defense spending. The spectre of 10- and 11-year-olds</i><br>
<i>&gt; dressed in camouflage, toting rifles as they stalk their peers, serves</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the new "Red menace" for a prison-industrial complex that is coming</i><br>
<i>&gt; to rival the military-industrial complex. This time the enemy is among</i><br>
<i>&gt; us -- our own children.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wars, of course, can be useful. World War II drafted 10 million American</i><br>
<i>&gt; men after the Great Depression rendered more than 15 million Americans</i><br>
<i>&gt; jobless. In deindustrializing economies, prisons convert otherwise</i><br>
<i>&gt; expendable and potentially subversive residents into raw material and</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit margins. The war on crime is assimilating young people on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; margins by criminalizing them largely for nonviolent, economically</i><br>
<i>&gt; motivated offenses such as drug possession. Three-strikes-you're-out</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws make it clear that there is no such thing as redemption once you've</i><br>
<i>&gt; activated the tripwire.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Facing up to Springfield -- or Pearl, Miss., or Memphis or Jonesboro --</i><br>
<i>&gt; will require acknowledging that children devalue life to the extent that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the adult world devalues their lives. In towns long considered America's</i><br>
<i>&gt; heartland, mean children are arming themselves in imitation of adults</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasingly determined to prove they can be meaner.</i><br>
<i>&gt; SALON | May 27, 1998</i><br>
<p>
Also, from the amount of time the media focuses on people who use guns to solve<br>
their problems in a wrong manner, some children may be developing the idea that<br>
the world pays attention to people who use guns. Children in todays increasingly<br>
single parent family structures are starved for love and attention, and some<br>
will do anything to get it.<br>
