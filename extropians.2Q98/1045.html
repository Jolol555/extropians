<i>&gt; Btw, it might be a good idea to accept that transhumanism, just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryonics for example, is for the enlightened few. Of course some</i><br>
<i>&gt; preaching (in order to win souls) to the outside world is great, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; even necessary to keep the membership steady, but it may also</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a good idea to "turn inwards", and make things more worthwile for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the people you already have. Transhuman institutions like ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt; (or one specially created for this purpose) could offer more tangible</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefits to their members, or rather the members to eachother.</i><br>
<p>
Memetic r and K strategies; either you try to have a lot of offspring<br>
(spread the memes widely) or you try to have few offspring but make<br>
sure they thrive ("turn invards").<br>
<p>
As I see it we want as many people as possible to think about or use<br>
transhumanist ideas, but there is no real need to have lots of people<br>
in our institutions. However, at present more people would be useful,<br>
since we are yet to reach the critical mass needed to make our<br>
institutions work really smoothly and offer truly useful services to<br>
the members (far too many of us are busy with careers of various<br>
kinds, making our ability to work for transhuman goals rather spotty).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example, now everyone has to more or less figure out for himself</i><br>
<i>&gt; what he can do to fully use today's technological potential. That is</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardly efficient. It would be good to have an easy-to-use, frequently</i><br>
<i>&gt; updated database where the best of all fields is registered, described</i><br>
<i>&gt; and recommended. From this database a program could be made</i><br>
<i>&gt; that members can take to become more efficient (like, dare I say it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientology has, only based on more enlightened principles). If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can effectively make people "healthy, wealthy and wise" (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; immortal while you're at it) there should be a reasonable rise in </i><br>
<i>&gt; membership. A good product sells itself.</i><br>
<p>
A very good idea. How to make this work is another matter - this is<br>
exactly the kind of thing you need a critical mass to get off the<br>
ground.<br>
