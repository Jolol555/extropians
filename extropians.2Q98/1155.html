I've been thinking about the issue of antibiotic resistance and it occurred to<br>
me that the best strategy for the human race would be;<br>
<p>
1) Tight control on the use of antibiotics in animals.<br>
2) A free hand for geneticists who want to breed resistance into animals - good<br>
luck to them<br>
3) Use the best bits from what we learn by messing with the animals DNA into<br>
ourselves.<br>
<p>
The above strategy maximises returns for humans.  My reasoning is that while we<br>
may be able to 'win' this war with ever more expensive and complex antibiotics,<br>
we'll never be able to shift lots of the stuff to poor people like we can with<br>
the older antibiotics.  We have got to stop using antibiotics in animals<br>
otherwise it's *our* biodiversity that is at risk.<br>
<p>
If we banned the use of antibiotics in animals, can you imagine how much money<br>
would immediately shift to genetic research ?  Farmers cannot produce food at<br>
modern levels of productivity without antibiotics.  If their only option was<br>
breeding (with a helping hand from Dr. DNA)  then you can be sure that<br>
capitalism will 'do it's thing' for us here.<br>
