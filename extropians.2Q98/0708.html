<i>&gt;Anyone is free to (non-coercively) prevent others from being stupid. For</i><br>
instance, I'm doing that<br>

Right, and I know that no (well, probably, but you never know) Extropian<br>
would hold a grudge against this. But Lee Dee called himself a "militant<br>
atheist". Maybe I have a lingual problem here, but "militant" comes from<br>
"military", and military is certainly not what I would call non-coercive.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Before deciding that you're militantly anti-Extropian, it would help if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;understood what is extropian.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think I've understood it. Probably better than you, the founder.<br>
