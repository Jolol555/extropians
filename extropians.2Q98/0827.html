<i>&gt;It is difficult, if not impossible, for me to demonstrate my ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;choose what I believe.  After all, I could TELL you that I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;something differently, but how would you know it empirically?  However, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to be able to demonstrate my control over whether I listen to</i><br>
<i>&gt;something or not by, say, turning on or off the television, or by</i><br>
<i>&gt;observably listening or not listening to someone else.</i><br>
<p>
If I hadn't sent my last mail to the list, you would not have replied. If I<br>
had written something different, you would have replied differently. If you<br>
had written something different in your original posting, I would have<br>
replied differently or not at all. If you hadn't replied, I would have let<br>
the thread die out.<br>
<p>
The exchange of information determines our actions entirely. If I had locked<br>
you in a sensory deprivation tank for the first 10 years of your life, you<br>
would probably be an uneducated, extremely aggressive asshole, or maybe a<br>
suicidal pessimist. If you had grown up in a socialist environment with all<br>
its propaganda, you would probably be a socialist today.<br>
<p>
Even now, I can determine your future actions regarding this thread with<br>
sufficient likeliness (although or even _because_ now that I've told you,<br>
you would probably act differently than expected)  -- i.e., it is likely<br>
that you would stop the discussion if I called you a mindless troll and it<br>
is -- surprise! -- also likely that you stopped if I said that I agree with<br>
all what you said.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- From a utilitarian moral standpoint, I put forward that "coercion"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(which, according to axiom 1, is characterized by a lack of "control")</i><br>
<p>
It is not. Actually, there is *only* coercion, but there are different<br>
degrees and types of it.<br>
<p>
- unconscious informational coercion, I would call it soft coercion, like<br>
every normal communication<br>
- deliberate informational coercion, I would call it hard coercion, also in<br>
verbal<br>
- unconscious physical coercion<br>
- deliberate physical coercion<br>
<p>
A militant atheist exercises type two, deliberate informational coercion, on<br>
others, although it is often a mix between type one and type two -- he is<br>
not necessarily aware of the degree of coercion he exercises.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Coercion is not necessarily wrong, if we accept</i><br>
<i>&gt;your definition.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Definitely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I put forward that under your definition, the atheist IS coercing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;believer; but that this is irrelevant from a moral standpoint,</i><br>
<p>
Depends on the degree and the consequences of the coercion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2.1)  Axiom.  Reducing the well-being of others is morally wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.2)  Axiom.  A person's well-being is reduced when they cannot get what</i><br>
<i>&gt;they desire.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.3)  Definition.  Coercion prevents people from getting what they desire.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.4)  Therefore.  Coercion is morally wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;OR</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;B</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.1)  Axiom.  Reducing the well-being of others is morally wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.2)  Definition.  Coercion does not reduce the well-being of others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.3)  Therefore.  Coercion is not necessarily morally wrong.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
OR<br>
<p>
C<br>
<p>
2.1) Axiom. The fundamentals make up the basic worldview of a person with<br>
which any other information is correlated.<br>
2.2) Axiom: Destroying the fundamentals of others' can damage their psyche<br>
and thereby reduce their well-being.<br>
2.3) Axiom. Reducing the well-being of others is morally wrong.<br>
2.4) Definition: Communication is a type of coercion.<br>
2.5) Therefore. Coercion can lead to destroying the fundamentals of others'<br>
beliefs, which can damage their psyche, which is morally wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;sigh&gt;  Look, you might try to argue that my desire to discuss them was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;under my control, but the presence of two non-trivial replies to your</i><br>
<i>&gt;postings should sufficiently evince that I DO want to discuss them.  I WANT</i><br>
<i>&gt;to discuss them, with you and with others, somewhere else.  Is this</i><br>
<i>&gt;closed-mindedness?</i><br>
<p>
No, certainly not. But we are currently breaking the rules of the Extropian<br>
cult :-&gt;. We would have to move this discussion to a different mailing list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you trying to tell me that extropy can be discussed in one place, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;one place only, and that this is it?</i><br>
<p>
No. I am trying to tell you that the Extropy mailing list is the best place<br>
to discuss extropy. Not the transhuman mailing list, not the sliced-bread<br>
mailing list and certainly not the alien visitor mailing list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Extropy Institute only BEGAN in 1992, and already the "Extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt;Principles" have undergone several revisions.  To my knowledge, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;majority of extropians did not reject the changes in each revision.</i><br>
<p>
Then let's see what will happen when I suggest a change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As Max pointed out (in a much cruder fashion than I would have liked), you</i><br>
<i>&gt;have in no way proven that extropianism is a cult.</i><br>
<p>
See my reply to Natasha and Ian.<br>
