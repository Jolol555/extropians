Sorry, Damien. I remembered that at one point we were using "spike"<br>
and "swell" as two alternatives, but I had forgotten that you had<br>
achieved a synthesis. I should go back to "phase change" as a<br>
descriptor for the instantaneous hypothesis. Anders and I seem to<br>
have agreed on a consise characterization of the differences in<br>
our positions. I think this is a positive result that clarifies the<br>
issues, at least for me.<br>

Yeah, but we'll buy more books this way! It is as easy to buy from<br>
them at from amazon, and lower exchange rate takes the sting out of<br>
the extra cost for fast delivery.<br>
