<i>&gt; From:          "Lee Daniel Crocker" &lt;lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net (none)&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; A similar fear is that of industries kept in place by government</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercion, such as copyrights and patents.</i><br>
<p>
These industries are not "kept in place" by government coercion, <br>
except in the sense that any business is protected by keeping looters <br>
away.<br>
<p>
  It is assumed that<br>
<i>&gt; those industries--publishing, music, software--will be decimated</i><br>
<i>&gt; if those "protections" are removed.  That's absolutely right--and</i><br>
<i>&gt; equally cause for celebration</i><br>
<p>
We should celebrate the death of all forms of publication, plus news <br>
reporting?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as the human spirit of creativity</i><br>
<i>&gt; is released from the bonds of labor, free to create and influence</i><br>
<i>&gt; all other industries toward an even higher standard of living,</i><br>
<i>&gt; more art, more writing, and more software.</i><br>
<p>
A thousand years ago, every artist was directly rewarded by the <br>
people whom he directly delivered his art to, but could do nothing <br>
about copying and could not do any form of indirect delivery.<br>
<p>
Today, some artists sell their art to people who choose to make it <br>
freely available, while others receive indirect payment from each <br>
individual consumer -- who also receives the art indirectly.  Only a <br>
tiny fraction of art revenues are related to art delivered directly <br>
from artist to consumer.<br>
<p>
A thousand years ago, only a tiny fraction of households contained <br>
any art whatsoever that wasn't made by its residents.  Today, nearly <br>
every home does.<br>
<p>
Eliminate copyrights and patents, and indirect payment ceases to <br>
exist; so the artists who live off that indirect payment -- the large <br>
majority of those who can live off their art at all -- must turn to <br>
other fields.  They will produce less art, or no art at all.<br>
<p>
How does driving artists away from art and into other fields, produce <br>
more art?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nothing could be better for writers than to lose their present</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercively-supported jobs and be freed to create as they wished,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or use their creative talents in new ways.  Nothing could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; better for the government price-supported wheat farmer than to</i><br>
<i>&gt; lose his subsidy and be freed to use his talents in more</i><br>
<i>&gt; productive ways.</i><br>
<p>
There is a substantial difference between being protected from <br>
looters who want to receive the benefit of your work without paying <br>
you (the writer as described), and being protected *by* looters who <br>
compel others to pay you without receiving the benefit of your work <br>
(the farmer as described).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Nothing could be better for the politician</i><br>
<i>&gt; than to be voted out of a job and be freed to use his consensus-</i><br>
<i>&gt; building talents in a profitable enterprise.</i><br>
<p>
This is easily disproven: the politician is free, today, to walk away <br>
from politics and use his consensus-building talents in a profitable <br>
enterprise.  Look how many choose to remain politicians until they <br>
either retire or can no longer find continued employment in politics.<br>
<p>
And again, the politician (the one currently holding elective office, <br>
anyway) is protected *by* looters, not *from* looters.  He receives <br>
payment taken by force from people who not only do not *receive* his <br>
services, but do not *desire* his services -- or even consider them <br>
to be services.<br>
<p>
The novel-writer simply wants to be paid by the novel-reader.  If the <br>
reader chooses to not read that novel, its author expects no payment. <br>
 But novel-writers who receive no payment and have no reason to <br>
expect any payment in the future, tend to stop writing novels.  <br>
Without copyrights, there would be no expectation of payment.<br>
<p>
And while I am sure we all agree that 90% of all art produced today <br>
is crap, we don't necessarily agree on *which* 90%.<br>
