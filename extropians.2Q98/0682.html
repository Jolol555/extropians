<i>&gt; A few years ago I had an idea for my very own work of art which I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet to act on.  Commonly the value of art is directly associated with</i><br>
<i>&gt; its rarity.  So I propose (assuming I'm not too late) a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Network Art" which increases in value when it increases in ubiquity</i><br>
<i>&gt; (like all good networks).  I propose this as a sort of play on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; popular definition of what makes art "valuable" and a homage to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; network age.</i><br>
<p>
A fascinating idea. What about running it as a distributed<br>
evolutionary system where each node allows users to breed new<br>
artworks, which then diffuse to appear at other nodes or become part<br>
of the art produced there? The more people who used the system the<br>
more diversity and computer power there would be. One could even have<br>
slightly different nodes, some where one creates 3D objects a la<br>
Latham and some that produce 2D art (which can be used as textures for<br>
the 3D stuff) and so on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem comes with putting this idea into practise.  It would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy to network over the Internet and/or running it on a computer, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would rather it retain some ties with "traditional" works of art. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, that would be delightful. One possibility is that some of the<br>
"nodes" are installations with (say) cameras so that people standing<br>
in front of them become part of the input to the evolution of 2D<br>
pictures elsewhere.<br>
<p>
I like your idea, it would be a wonderful way of expressing our values<br>
and ideas!<br>
