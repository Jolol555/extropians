<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; concerning the life and death of 10000000 Indians than Bill Gates does.</i><br>
<p>
depending on how much bill wants to see those 10000000 people dead.<br>
Again, on the whim of a dictator...<br>
<i>&gt; 		  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;Not to mention that most people's wieldable money (spare money?) is </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;much less than 2% of a rich person's spare money.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 		  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not you against the world, no viable PPA would have only one member, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; if you need money to prevent you from being hanged tomorrow morning then your </i><br>
<i>&gt; spare money is 100% of your total net worth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Which would mean that you would just die of some other cause in the<br>
extremely short term.  What i meant by spare money is money that can be<br>
used for things other than necessities, necessities being anything you<br>
need to survive (just food, probably shelter in non-tropical areas, and<br>
expenses spent in getting the income/means to get the previous two). This<br>
spare money, for most people in the worlds, is an extremely small<br>
percentage of their total income, and is smaller the smaller the income<br>
is. So you get this exponential, instead of linear relationship between<br>
total income and spare money, which means that those 10000000 indians have<br>
some sum approaching zero (its tricky for them to survive without any<br>
other expenses), and bill's (or pick your favourite billionaire)<br>
approaching huge.  Net effect: bill 0 Indians -10000000<br>
If you are poor, you couldn't count on your PPA being supported by some<br>
billionaire since any billionaire would know that he would just be<br>
supporting the rest.  In fact, i don't see any PPA supporting the poor<br>
people since they have nothing to gain from this, apart from forced labor<br>
and slavery.<br>
The analogies that naturally emanate between the description in the above<br>
two paragraphs and nation states were not premeditated.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;Also, what's the difference between a large PPA and a standard </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;nation state, in which you pay taxes to be protected?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 		  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unlike a government a PPA  will not force you to join or pay them one dime  </i><br>
<i>&gt; because it does not claim rights an individual does not have. If I need money  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't claim the right to take it from you regardless of your wishes. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Government does.</i><br>
<p>
And what is stopping the PPA from claiming that right?<br>
<i>&gt; 		  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;What will protect you from your own PPA?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Possibly nothing, one PPA might become  far more powerful than any other,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; turn psychotic and take over everything. It could happen, but it's much less  </i><br>
<i>&gt; likely than the US Army doing it and setting up a military dictatorship, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and they certainly have the power to do so if they wanted. </i><br>
<p>
They are just paid a "tithe" of 300 billion dollars a year by the US<br>
population.  Rest of the world's armies do simmilar things, unless their<br>
tithe is too low, in which cases they decide to take more direct<br>
approaches. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At the first signs </i><br>
<i>&gt; of totalitarian behavior in a PPA, people could simply stop doing business </i><br>
<i>&gt; with it and switch to a competitor, this would cut off its lifeblood, money. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember, doing business with a PPA is voluntary and that gives enormous  </i><br>
<i>&gt; power to people, a power that citizens forced to finance the army and police  </i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless of their opinion of it do not have. </i><br>
Again, the fact that the "laws" and "rights" are backed up by PPAs, they<br>
do not apply to PPAs.  Doing business with a PPA is voluntary as long as<br>
that PPA lets it be a voluntary thing. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, just like now, PPA's in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a world without government would attract people who enjoy exercising control </i><br>
<i>&gt; over other people, but unlike the police and army of today, it would also </i><br>
<i>&gt; attract people who enjoy making money. Those kind of people are much safer to </i><br>
<i>&gt; have in positions of power.                     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
i would say that is exactly the kind of people that are in a position of<br>
power right now.  How many dictators are poor after their time in<br>
government?<br>
