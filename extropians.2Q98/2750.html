Yes it does, and all the two objects of this investigation have to do is plead<br>
their right to not speak under the Fifth Amendment. That they have not done<br>
this, and have testified that nothing happened, then gone on to be taped by<br>
people saying it did happen and urging people to lie about it is what this<br>
investigation is about. Clinton knows that if he does plead the Fifth , that his<br>
administration is over, which is why liberals have their skirts all up in a<br>
bunch about this, and exposing their own hipocracy...<br>
