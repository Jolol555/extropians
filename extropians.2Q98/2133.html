<i>        &gt;physical reality. Number 2 is, in and of itself, true by 100%, but </i><br>

          <br>
<p>
So questions that seem perfectly meaningful, reasonable and clear cut to  <br>
humans (Did the particle go through the left slot or the right slot or both <br>
slots or no slot?) are really ambiguous (How long is a piece of string?) <br>
or gibberish (Did the klognee go through the fisben or the onrobonob?). <br>
The trouble is this question is as simple and basic as it's possible to ask <br>
and you're saying we can't even get that one right. Well maybe, but if so then <br>
the word "truth", that after all humans invented, can't have much meaning. <br>
<p>
It seems to me saying our most basic questions are fuzzy but the truth is <br>
clear cut is equivalent to saying our questions are clear cut but the truth <br>
is fuzzy, one is just a euphemism for the other. <br>
