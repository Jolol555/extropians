 I am not one for defending Christianity, but my reading of the New<br>
 Testament seems to indicate that Jesus kept denying his divinity and kept<br>
 telling his followers to stop treating him any differently than any other<br>
 human.  I believe that his followers are the ones who diefied him, as with<br>
 many great men.  The legend took on a life of its own, and has little<br>
 relation to the actual history. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Actually you're both a bit off... read it and weep (or laugh)... keep in mind<br>
that there are several different versions written from several different<br>
biased perspectives, for example, compare Paul the zealot and woman hater, vs.<br>
the softer Leo Busgalia like St. Matt.    If you were to watch Monty Python's<br>
Life of Brian you'd  get a clearer idea of what life was like during those<br>
times, some of the mentality, and also social circumstances.   Christ no doubt<br>
had rebelled against the tyranny of the temple.   As all authority then was<br>
believed to be granted by god, it would have only made sense for him to<br>
present himself as (or believe himself to believe) some sort of prophet.   At<br>
that time there was also a trend of faith healers, televangelists and all<br>
sorts of what is sometimes refered to in Yiddish as "chazerai" - - definitely<br>
it would have taken a "charismatic" figure to create a counter movement.   For<br>
his times, no doubt, Christ was a leftist and revolutionary.   He redeemed the<br>
Jews from a life encompassing legal system of 613 laws guided by a highly<br>
organized theocrascy.    He deserves atleast a tidbit of credit for this, even<br>
in retrospect if his method of porpagating those ideas were a bit distasteful<br>
to us enlightened transhumans.    Incidently, I believe that Ben Franklin  and<br>
Thomas Jefferson were involved in the writing of a softer and more humanistic<br>
version of the Bible in which all references to "the diety" were eliminated.<br>
Carrying the issue back to the present, we might ask, can the masses really be<br>
appealed to with common sense ?    If a highly superstitious idiot  was<br>
pointing a gun at you, and you could get away saving you life by telling him<br>
that a ghost was about to hit him over the head with a baseball bat to save<br>
your doubt, would you do it ???     Let's take it a step further...No one, for<br>
example, doubts the leadership of Ghandi, but did the fact that his followers<br>
viewed him as a saint have anything to do with his followers ?   What type of<br>
modern day Christ or Ghandi would it take to make Cryonics such a well<br>
entrenched social institution as Christianity so we're not in danger of<br>
extinction, or by lowering ourselves to such levels would we be defeating our<br>
purposes ?<br>
