<i>&gt; From:          ChuckKuecker &lt;ckuecker@mcs.net&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; One of the pluses of the suborbital is that the longest possible trip is</i><br>
<i>&gt; well under an hour. Too short for boredome, and if it was true orbital, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; get some time at zero gee..</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't have to be true orbital to achieve that; merely ballistic.<br>
<p>
(An orbital trajectory is a ballistic trajectory that goes <br>
completely around another body without ever impacting anything.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, there is no pollution involved as is the case in virtually every</i><br>
<i>&gt; launch system I can think of. Even Liek Myrabo's Lightcraft will produce NOx</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the superheated air that propels tham. Also, no launch system except a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mass driver has the capability of recovering even a small percentage of</i><br>
<i>&gt; launch energy.</i><br>
<p>
In order for a mass driver to recover energy, it must *catch* things. <br>
 With a non-portable mass driver, this requires extremely high <br>
precision on the launch, or post-launch guidance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then, there's the air drag losses inescapable with atmospheric travel for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the launch/reentry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For the best efficiency, the evacuated tube reigns supreme, second only to</i><br>
<i>&gt; travel in space. I think, however, we will see the use of suborbital rockets</i><br>
<i>&gt; as transports MUCH sooner than underground sattelites!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;On an unrelated tentacle, here is a monkey catapult idea. You probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;know that liquid CPR has arrived as an advanced ER technique. Well, if </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;floating in a container of saline with lungs full of oxygenated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fluorocarbon you can as well put you into a Luna-located</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;PV/capacitor-driven linear motor a few km long, while keeping the g's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well below monkey homogenization threshold.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Take a superconducting coil, and make sure it won't quench due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;launch forces, and mount it upon a composite (you'd have to shield the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;human, though) containment with a (anaesthesized or VR-entertained) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;monkey pickled in saline/fluorocarbon, add a fuel cell and some </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;controlling circuit and hurl the whole thing from the lunar linear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;motor catapult. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Of course you must make sure an inverse thing catches you on the other </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;end, orelse this is just an expensive means of having you making a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;GIANT impact upon poor unsuspecting target, and you probably won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;like the saline that much (you can remove the lung flooding while </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in transit),</i><br>
<p>
If you're going to be caught by a mirror image of the launch device, <br>
you probably want to be caught in the same circumstances used to <br>
launch you, except perhaps facing the opposite direction.<br>
<i>&gt; My feeling is that the Star Trek transporter or anything even remotely</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar will turn out to be quite unworkable. Think of the bandwidth</i><br>
<i>&gt; requirements for transmission and the precision required for the encoder and</i><br>
<i>&gt; decoder/reassembler! Damn shame. Also, too many people have seen 'The Fly'...</i><br>
<p>
To me, it isn't the bandwidth or the precision that create the <br>
problems; rather, it's the combined requirement of precision and <br>
SPEED.  You don't want to FEEL things taking you apart, and you don't <br>
want to suffer any symptoms (dying, for example) of being only <br>
partially assembled.  That'll be the big potential show-stopper.<br>
<p>
As for "The Fly", travel agents report that the movie "Titanic" <br>
caused a big *jump* in cruise-ship bookings.<br>
