<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; with a system whereby the entire crew compartment ejected as a whole with</i><br>
<i>&gt; built in parachutes...what would be the problem in having such a concept for</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial passenger aircraft?  That is: in the event of a "crash and burn"</i><br>
<i>&gt; emergency the pilot could eject the passenger compartment.  It then descending</i><br>
<i>&gt; on it's own automatically deployed chutes.  Since said compartment would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; much lighter than the entire airframe  it would possible require less chutes.</i><br>
<p>
This was used on the F-111 and the F/B-111, as well as the EF-111, obviously. The<br>
maintenance of the capsule was equal to around 1/4 to 1/3 that of the rest of the<br>
airplane, increased its weight (and therefore decreased its range and performance,<br>
and increased its cost) The capsule pressurized at a level equal to 8500 feet, and<br>
could be entirely ejected rapidly with a built in rocket motor, even while on the<br>
ground. It had a set of parachutes equal in size to those used on the Apollo space<br>
capsule, as well as a rapidly deployed attenuation bag that inflated just prior to<br>
touchdown. In the event of an ejection in flight at low altitudes, such as those<br>
experienced by commercial airliners during takeoffs and landing approaches, the<br>
capsule hits the ground rather hard with horizontal velocity retained, frequently<br>
causing serious back injury to the occupants.<br>
<p>
This concept is not used in any civil aircraft of any type for the simple reason<br>
that its too damn expensive to own and maintain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course...the redesign of the airframe might negate any saving.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And the pilots might complain...but presumably they might be trained in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; use of individual parachutes...or have a seperate system for the pilot</i><br>
<i>&gt; compartment.</i><br>
<p>
There are currently parachute retreival systems available for aircraft of up to<br>
2-6 seater private types, like a Cessna 182 or a Piper. They deploy the chute with<br>
a small rocket, and give a rather staid ride down for the entier aircraft.<br>
<p>
Using such systems obviously is a matter of mass and economics. Considering that<br>
air travel is safer than sitting on your own toilet, its rather obvious why there<br>
are no commercial airliners that have large parachutes and attenuation bags to<br>
retreive an entire plane. The long term costs of maintaining and lugging around<br>
all of that unproductive mass far exceed what customers are apparently willing to<br>
pay for the marginal increased safety.<br>
