Anders Sandberg wrote 4/7/98: &lt;My current definition of transhumanism is:<br>
"The idea that the human condition can be improved above and beyond the<br>
current stage, through rational means in a life affirming way".&gt;<br>
<p>
This is a good stab at a definition.  As you know from past list<br>
discussions, definitions are critical to communication, which is critical<br>
to developing a consensual moral polity, which is critical to achieving<br>
great aims in the future.  It seems to me that defining what a human is,<br>
has not met with consensus and that defining what a transhuman is,<br>
therefore, is putting the cart before the horse.<br>
<p>
That said, since speculation for fun is the lifeblood of e-lists, I would<br>
like to offer that "rational means" is wedded to the concept of "truth,"<br>
and "a life affirming way" is wedded to the concept of "good."  All you are<br>
missing is some part of your definition that is wedded to the concept of<br>
"beauty."  "Beauty" should enter in as an aim, what transhumanism aims for.<br>
 Across all scientific endeavors, at all scales, spatial and temporal,<br>
preferred branches of development reveal themselves.  Transhumanism should<br>
be aiming at maximizing chances of successful speciation by learning where<br>
these preferred branches are located.  I like the idea of defining<br>
transhumanism as an "idea" because it avoids getting bogged down in<br>
prescriptive or normative ethics, i.e., it doesn't come across as a<br>
"program" or a utopian manifesto.  Optionally, you might bring in some<br>
concept wedded to "adventure," something relating to the vitality of<br>
pursuing enhanced consciousness and indefinite longevity.<br>
<p>
The inclusion of "a life affirming way" naturally excludes enthusiasts of<br>
abortion, infanticide and euthanasia since these are all life devaluing,<br>
not affirming.  Freedom to murder is not liberty, it's license.  These<br>
enthusiasts, who sanction predatory behavior against the weak, the sick and<br>
the old, who adhere to the "might makes right" ethic of entropic<br>
death-worship, are essentially ape-like thugs who aim no higher than the<br>
next tree branch up in a fetid jungle.  They may masquerade as<br>
transhumanists or extropians, but they live an ugly lie, incoherently and<br>
irrationally posturing as if they "affirm life" and mouthing vapid<br>
platitudes about "non-coercion" while forcing everyone to tolerate their<br>
endorsement and practice of butchery.<br>
