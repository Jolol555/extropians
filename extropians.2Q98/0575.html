   IAN: Right, rational thinking minus creativity<br>
   is a computer, and computers invent nothing --<br>
   that is, unless we can digitize creativity.<br>
<p>
   Creativity minus the rational is fantasy, and<br>
   fantasy by itself also leads to no progress. <br>
   But interface the two and you have progress.<br>
<p>
   Einstein supposedly spent quite a bit of time<br>
   as a youth fantasizing what it would be like <br>
   to ride on a beam of light as a surfer rides <br>
   on a surf board. Such fantasy was as much a <br>
   part of this innovations as were the lessons<br>
   in rational thinking he learned in college.<br>
