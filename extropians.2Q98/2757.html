<i> &gt; I am presently attempting to improve my use of the internet; a </i><br>
<i> &gt; problem of applied Intelligence Amplification.  I have a few questions </i><br>
<i> &gt; and an observation which I would greatly appreciate comments on.</i><br>
 <br>
An interesting project, I'm looking forward to the summary.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; What are your most effective sources of information on the internet?</i><br>
<p>
Documents, and people. People spontaneously segregate in virtual<br>
locations, and generate interesting informations streams both<br>
spontaneously, and upon cues. Of course you have to pay for these<br>
resources in the same coin. Documents can be found by searching, both<br>
locally and globally in web spider indexes. Unfortunately, the growth<br>
of both nodes and documents therein has long outstripped the<br>
capabilities of even distributed search engines. If apache was to <br>
marry webglimpse, and would send the rebuilt index actively, or even <br>
link up with others to act as a global distributed search engine <br>
the problem would go away. While we are at that, we can fix the <br>
backlink problem properly, and take care of stale links (if a document <br>
is referenced more than once, it is likely to float in some cache <br>
somewhere, so with proper addressing scheme it could survive even if <br>
the original site is down -- once all references have vanished, the <br>
space can be reclaimed by garbage collection). <br>
 <br>
Apart from documents and people there are interactive, dynamically<br>
generated documents, map servers, e.g. <br>
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~bradley/mrsid/bay_area/">http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~bradley/mrsid/bay_area/</a><br>
structure generators, translators, etc. These are becoming<br>
progressively more important.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; How did you find those sources?</i><br>
 <br>
By word of mouth, hotlinks and search engines.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; How do you make use of those sources?</i><br>
 <br>
Personally I scan the email, crosspost relevant items to several<br>
persons/mailing lists. The big problem remains mail management. Even<br>
the best mail agents are incapable of handling more than 6k messages,<br>
which forces me to start afresh frequently, leaving the gzipped INBOX <br>
body in some vault. Once I can set up my home machine properly, I will <br>
make a giant (well, by now several 100 MBytes of gzipped mail are to<br>
be processed) <a href="http://critmail.org">http://critmail.org</a> of it, and index it with webglimpse.<br>
I think permanent connectivity is not a pipe dream anymore, even<br>
outside of California. Of course having a webcam, and NMEA feed from<br>
a GPS receiver is the logical next step. Relying on cellular is<br>
expensive, and radio modems are not ubiquitously available, not very<br>
cheap. Also, I don't understand why people do not turn fine-grain<br>
providers, linking up with neighbour's housenets, offering mutual<br>
router capabilities. One should think a (even diskless) i386/i486 <br>
8 MByte Linux box with several NICs is not so very expensive.<br>
<p>
I read the documents on the web, in the last time frequently abusing <br>
the local <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a> mirror. Let's hope similiar services<br>
will spring up for other fields, I'm missing this particularly for<br>
chemistry and biosciences. Researcher's pages are very useful, but<br>
sometimes hard to find. Almost forgot: mailing list archives are<br>
sometimes very useful. I even made a nightly mirror of CCL archive,<br>
unfortunately my current machine is unavailable for incoming ftp/http<br>
requests so currently I'm the only user. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Do you use filters or robots as an aid to processing material obtained </i><br>
<i> &gt; from the internet?</i><br>
 <br>
I distrust robots, though I've never used one. I think I'll wait for<br>
learning neural nets which learn from looking over my shoulder. I<br>
think people are the best filters, and I'd wish more people would<br>
participate in the transhumantech@excelsior.org effort.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; It strikes me that a very well-thought out document "How to use the net", </i><br>
<i> &gt; along the lines of Mortimer Adler's "How to read a book" would be </i><br>
<p>
Apropos books: my next project is OCRing my entire library, book by<br>
book, and digest my CD collection into mp3. Ideally, these should live <br>
in a wearable computer. <a href="http://www.netwinder.org">http://www.netwinder.org</a> seems like a good<br>
starting point for a conversion. Particularly built-in networking and<br>
IrDA make it sound ideal for hot-synching with the home unit.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; extremely useful.  _All_ guides to the net I know of focus on what </i><br>
<i> &gt; resources are available, not the applied skills which are necessary to </i><br>
<i> &gt; make the most efficient use of the net.  </i><br>

Sorry, this has become unfocused/ranty. No time to fix it up, gotta<br>
run.<br>

ciao,<br>
