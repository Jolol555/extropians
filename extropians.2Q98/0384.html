<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; While operating a crane, a forklift, or a tractor trailer may not be as</i><br>
<i>&gt; unskilled</i><br>
<i>&gt;  posistions as a ditch digger, the fact is that a reasonably well trained</i><br>
<i>&gt;  individual can pretty much master the job requirements in 6 weeks of</i><br>
<i>&gt; training.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (Forklift training actually takes one day, but I'll be generous). &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not meaning to detract from your overall point Mike...with which I agree</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...but....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've done two of the above....(forklift and tractor trailer)...and must</i><br>
<i>&gt; confess that it does take only a short time to learn the rudiments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Like it only takes a few minutes to learn how to ride a horse....right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I mean...how difficult is it?  You just sit up there in the saddle...hold the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reins...use your knees ever now and then...and everything is peachy keen?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously that is nonsense....as is the idea that you can be a skilled tractor</i><br>
<i>&gt; trailer operator in such a short period of time.  Consider why the major</i><br>
<i>&gt; carriers (non union) pay so much more for experience....  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Greater experience means greater productivity...less wear and tear on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment...and fewer accidents...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And as far a CRANE!!  &lt;shudder&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 I've never operated a crane, but I've watched a few.  It seems to me <br>
that, typically, the crane starts moving horizontally (inc. <br>
rotating) before the load does, and the crane stops first as well.<br>
<p>
So to quickly move a load from one place to another, put it down in <br>
place, and not hit anything you didn't intend to hit, probably takes <br>
quite a bit of practice.<br>
