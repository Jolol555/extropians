   IAN: I also had one vivid dream sequence from which <br>
   I awoke. Several weeks later the entire event unfolded,<br>
   down to the most minute details,  involving things in <br>
   a room I'd never been before and the people in it and<br>
   the things they were doing. It was a doctors office.<br>
   Precancerous growths were found and removed from <br>
   me, so the event had a significance. So many <br>
   details were exact that I have to believe<br>
   that I had some kind of "fore vision."<br>
<p>
   At the time of the dream I had no idea that I would <br>
   be at that doctor's office or that I had any health <br>
   problem, so it could not have been anticipation.<br>
<p>
   I've also had deja vu that's too uncanny to dismiss. <br>
   It could be that we're "time blind," we cannot see down<br>
   the forth dimension for some reason. If we could we'd<br>
   it would probably destroy the illusion of being a free<br>
   agent. The mind obviously evolved to compensate for being<br>
   time blind by having to think logically in order to  be<br>
   able to predict what will happen. It's impossible to con-<br>
   ceive of existing physically in any way other than being <br>
   time-blind. But it may be that somehow at rare moments <br>
   the mind catches a glimpse of the future. But I agree <br>
   with you that probably nobody can control such vision. <br>
<p>
   The fact that experiments in quantum physics have shown<br>
   the backward-time-travel of particle waves, and the fact<br>
   that our brains are "tuned into the field," as it were,<br>
   may lay the physics ground work to explain psychic stuff:<br>
