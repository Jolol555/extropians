Imagine we could change the laws of physics, so that we could make a <br>
material with the following properties: cheap as concrete, and tough <br>
enough to withstand the blast of a supernova.  Out of this we could make <br>
walls, safes, locks,  armor light enough to coat vehicles<br>
and wear as clothes, envelopes impervious to snooping or <br>
tampering, and a wide variety of other devices to defeat violence <br>
against individuals and their property.  The security possible for  <br>
individuals in our current physical world would be put to shame.<br>
<p>
I know of a frontier where these kinds of materials are available.  <br>
Specifically, one-way functions, trapdoor one-way functions, and the <br>
other building blocks of cypherspace.   Offensive computations could <br>
quite literally consume the energies of supernovae, and still not crack <br>
codes generated by a lowly Intel chip.   These codes are currently <br>
available.  In the future with quantum cryptography, security against <br>
computers and quantum computers of even infinite energies is possible.   <br>
<p>
Out of these ultratough materials of cypherspace, we can really<br>
build  a Galt's Gulch: heretofore merely a metaphorical<br>
ideal or a hopeless dream about physical security.<br>
<p>
There has been a lot of hype about colonizing space, the oceans, and <br>
other physical frontiers.  American culture and perhaps even human <br>
instinct equate freedom with the physical frontier.  Some government <br>
bureaucracy  finds 1% water at a lunar pole and  some libertarians, <br>
recalling those old entertaining industrial-era yarns about a dreamy <br>
future on the Moon (a.k.a. heaven),  go gaga.   I have  more water, and <br>
more  of  almost everything else useful, in my literal backyard!<br>
<p>
Supposedly, mere physical distance, the mere increase of a constant <br>
factor  in the energy and time needed to get across the oceans <br>
or into space, is supposed to provide some protection from the thieves <br>
and parasites who first steal our livelihoods through taxes, then steal <br>
our very lives by harassing practitioners of advanced medicine. But the <br>
increased cost of a physical barrier is the same for both the offense <br>
and the defense.  Such a barrier offers no significant improvement to <br>
those wishing to defend their freedoms.  Only a barrier of great <br>
asymmetry, where defense is vastly more efficient than offense, turns <br>
the tides towards freedom.   Freedom in cypherspace, first for our <br>
communications, then for our financial transactions, then for the free <br>
flow of research and services from unlocatable medical laboratories.<br>
<p>
An extropian evolves beyond the stage of entropic griping or whining <br>
about our current condition of human slavery, and beyond the stage<br>
of participation  in the human tribal rituals of political bickering. We <br>
evolve beyond the naive belief that what passes for "politics" in our <br>
public-school-brainwashed and licensed-media-saturated culture <br>
constitutes any sort of effective political action.  An extropian <br>
evolves beyond wishful thinking inspired by those entertaining<br>
TV escape fantasy shows.  We transform our human desires to conquer the <br>
physical frontier into transhuman action which <br>
conquers the secure frontier of cypherspace.  We seize the liberty at <br>
hand!  I salute those extropians working on the colonization of <br>
cypherspace, and encourage many others with a knack for computers, <br>
mathematics, law, or business to join in.  Ad BlackNet Per Perspera!<br>
