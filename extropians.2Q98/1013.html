<p>
Again, *how* will people be able to but and use more or improved products<br>
when those products are being made almost completely with human labor?<br>
<p>
Your points on stock devaluation are well taken, but you have yet to<br>
demonstrate how the free-market can alleviate those people who are<br>
permanently automated out a job.  The automation process is accelerating<br>
faster than people are capable of re-training.  So as you said, if you are<br>
not suggesting that people become superfluous what are they going to do to<br>
survive besides begging or stealing.  If you can't answer this with adequate<br>
demonstration, then you have yet to meet the challenge that I proposed at the<br>
very beginning of this thread.<br>
