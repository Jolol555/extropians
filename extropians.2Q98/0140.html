<i>&gt; From:          "Lee Daniel Crocker" &lt;lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net (none)&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'd like to state that I don't _oppose_ anarcho-capitalism in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; itself.  It's a great idea, but I just don't think it will ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; work properly in this world with these people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a very common speculation, but it clearly flies in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; face of the abundant evidence of human history that free</i><br>
<i>&gt; societies--in this world, with these people--are now and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; always been the most peaceful societies, while centrally</i><br>
<i>&gt; controlled societies have always been the most brutal.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; indeed an extrapolation on the part of anarcho-capitalists to</i><br>
<i>&gt; thereby assume that even more freedom will result in even more</i><br>
<i>&gt; peace, but at least we're speculating in the same direction as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the data, not directly opposite from it.</i><br>
<p>
But it's a speculation on a boundary condition, which is <br>
precisely the sort of condition where simple extrapolation is <br>
prone to error.<br>
<p>
And it's a speculation premised on the observation that groups of <br>
people do not long remain leader-less, and about half an hour after <br>
they acquire a leader they have dissent against the leader.<br>
