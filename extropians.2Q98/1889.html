<i>&gt;&gt; I admire faith, and thus I choose not to argue against it.  As </i><br>
bivalent <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; truth is the foundation of an information system, it cannot be </i><br>
supported <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; using the precepts of that system, any more than you can say that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Pope is infallible because the infallible Pope said so. A foundation </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; cannot have foundations.  I chose to allow for fuzzy truth because I </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; find it more relaxing philosophically and allows me to see more </i><br>
creative <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; possibilities.  My support of fuzzy truth does not have any more </i><br>
logical <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; basis than your support of binary truth.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hardly.  The truth of certain axioms is unquestionable; A=A leaps to </i><br>
mind.<br>
<i>&gt;You cannot logically support a position under which 0.99A=A, unless A </i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;0.  In other words, if anything exists, then A = A; logic does not </i><br>
allow<br>
<i>&gt;for contradictions.</i><br>
<p>
I can't support 0.99A=A if I subscribed to bivalent logic and its forms <br>
of expression, but since I don't, there isn't any problem.  Fuzzy logic <br>
expressions are less concise than bivalent, because it is more precise.  <br>
A=A and .99A=A are expressed in fuzzy logic as follows (although I will <br>
be less than economical by not putting it all in symbolic notation)<br>
<p>
1.00A=1.00A to a 1.00 degree<br>
.99A=1.00A to a .99 degree<br>
<p>
When expressed in proper notation  the supposed contradictions <br>
disappear.  The main argument against fuzzy notation is that Aristotle <br>
didn't use it, and therefore anybody who does is a Satanist and going to <br>
hell.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Frankly, I think you have simply misspoken with respect to your point</i><br>
<i>&gt;about logic; in logic, things ARE either true or false.  It's one of </i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;defining characteristics of logic.</i><br>
<p>
It's one of the defining characteristics of bivalent logic, and it's <br>
philosophical child, logical atomism. I do not believe that historical <br>
precedence is sufficient reason to declare all other systems of logic to <br>
be impossible or immoral.  All that is necesary for a system of logic to <br>
be valid is that true conclusions follow from true premises, which fuzzy <br>
logic satisifies.<br>
  <br>
If you wish to adhere to fuzzy truth,<br>
<i>&gt;then you had best dump all pretenses of logic altogether and claim some</i><br>
<i>&gt;other higher ground; mysticism seems popular these days.  However, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing we logicians have shown, time and time again, is that the mystics</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot beat us on our own turf. </i><br>
<p>
You have caught me.  I am a mystic.  In fact, I am a Jungian <br>
psychologist.;)<br>
<p>
There are three definitions of mysticism in my dictionary &lt;American <br>
Heritage&gt; :<br>
1. Immediate consciousness of the transcendent or ultimate reality or <br>
God.<br>
2. A belief in the existence of essential realities beyond perceptual of <br>
intellectual apprehension that are accessible to subjective experience.<br>
3.Vague, groundless speculation<br>
<p>
I suppose that you mean mysticism in the third sense, while I support <br>
the second definition and have occasionally experienced the first.  You <br>
are correct that mystical beliefs are spreading quite rapidly in the <br>
Western scientific world.  This change in acceptance started with the <br>
quantum physics revolution, but I think the current upswing can be <br>
blamed on the spread of the Penrose/Hameroff quantum brain meme.  Many <br>
people still disagree with the theory that the human brain works via <br>
quantum computation, but the point has been reached that most people <br>
will admit that it is possible to both give credence to the idea and be <br>
in one's right mind. <br>
   Mysticism becomes sensible under these conditions by replacing 'God <br>
or ultimate reality' in the first definition with 'undifferentiated <br>
quantum field'.  Transcendental Consciousness is a state of <br>
consciousness in which there are no qualities (dichotomies) whatsoever, <br>
which is equivalent to the state of a quantum computer before you open <br>
it up and look inside.  Such a state cannot be experienced by <br>
intellectual or perceptual faculties (which I think are just different <br>
manifestations of the same thing) because by definition the intellect <br>
(logic) seperates things into parts.  This includes fuzzy logic, which <br>
differs from Aristotelian logic only in that it allows for partial <br>
dichotomies.<br>
   It is worth remembering that the seperation between mysticism and <br>
logic has only been a recent historical phenomenon.  All early <br>
scientific systems had decidedly mystical elements; from the Jewish <br>
Kabalists (who invented alchemy which begat chemistry) to the cult of <br>
the Pythagorans, to Plato and his forms.  It is not suprising that <br>
mysticism and logic are once again uniting. I think the division only <br>
occured in the first place because the Catholic Church decided the <br>
ambiguity of mysticism to be a threat to its authority and managed to <br>
mostly stamp it out in the Western world.  Now that the power of the <br>
church is waning, mysticism is once again flourishing.<br>
