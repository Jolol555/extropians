extending the reign of Moore's law beyond 2020, when we hit atomic-sized<br>

its merry path for the next 20 years.<br>
What are the possibilities for increasing computer power beyond that point?"<br>

I think that femtotech is a dead end.  Quantum effects render the<br>
preservation of information at this scale impossible.  However, the same<br>
effects enable the salvation: quantum computing.  Taking advantage of the<br>
many worlds-interpretation of QM, a quantum computer takes advantage of the<br>
enormous combinatorial explosion of combining quantum logic gates.   Each<br>
gate is not merely on or off, but in a superposition of the two states.<br>
Thus all possible computations are performed simultaneously.  A quantum<br>
computer could factor a large prime instantaneously.  That is why the NSA is<br>
funding much of the research.  The last lecture I saw on the subject (about<br>
a year and a half ago) a quantum NOT gate had been successfully produced.<br>
Its a start...so enjoy PGP while you can :)..<br>

On the subject of String Theory, a very informative book is Hyperspace by<br>
Michio Kaku, one of the founders of string theory.  Its a bit out of date<br>
(1994) but String theory is still hot, and getting hotter, although it has<br>
been replaced by manifold theory now.  We no longer have vibrating<br>
10-dimensional strings, but vibrating manifolds instead.  I am certainly a<br>
String (now manifold) convert.  Its where its at...21 century physics that<br>
we accidentally discovered a bit early..but if only we had the math to cope.<br>
