Or there's a bug that they can't fix because the power systems went out<br>
too, and they can't even run the computers long enough to find it. I don't<br>
expect that to happen, but if there are unexpected bugs that take down<br>
most of the power generation system for weeks then the rest of the economy <br>
is probably hosed. If there aren't, then we'll probably be OK by 2001.<br>

The question is, how long does the IRS have to go down before all those <br>
people who've lent trillions of dollars to the Feds decide that they're<br>
uncreditworthy and want their money back? <br>
<p>
Looking at the IRS' past record with computer systems I'd say that a long shutdown is quite probable; not to mention that they'll have to be willing <br>
to pay market prices when most of the world's COBOL programmers will be <br>
busy earning a hundred dollars an hour or more with commercial <br>
organizations.<br>
<p>
Based on what I've read, the best solution to the IRS problem would be <br>
to throw out their current system and write a new one from scratch; but<br>
they tried that a few years ago and failed.<br>
<p>
I don't believe much of what Gary North says, but I certainly expect that<br>
Y2K will have a major impact on the US government and others.<br>
