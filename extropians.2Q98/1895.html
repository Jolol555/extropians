I missed the earlier post, so I'll respond to this here.  You have<br>
incorrectly stated the nature of my statement.  Indeed, while deontology<br>
and consequentialism may sometimes agree on the same moral actions, they<br>
are two VERY distinct moral theories; there is no way you could construe<br>
one to be the other, despite the fact that they do have some overlap.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;     I think that M and L intersect, but not by 100%,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     which is to say, as you've articulated, that not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     all things that can be defined as "me first" can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     be defined as libertarian. I think that L is either</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     equal to U or all of L is in U, such that no L is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     external to U (which I think we agree). I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     that L may be defined: "me-first + nonaggression."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would agree with most of this, however, not with the total concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonagression. Personal Caveats vis a vis nonagression:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; a) no first strike policy against those who espouse and practice the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt; b) maintain a first strike policy against those who fall into a utilitarian or</i><br>
<i>&gt; communitarian subset which has in the past demonstrated a high likelihood to</i><br>
<i>&gt; practice first strike agression.</i><br>
<i>&gt; c) maintain and practice skills and equipment for first strike preparedness, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the threat of instant retaliation seems to be the only deterrent which agressor</i><br>
<i>&gt; type sets respect.</i><br>
<p>
You're going to maintain a first-strike policy against communitarians???<br>
You realize that this entails going out there with a weapon, TODAY, and<br>
killing as many non-libertarians as possible?  Besides the fact that this<br>
plan will be totally ineffective, (we're outnumbered, millions to one,) it<br>
ignores the possibility that these people could learn from their mistakes,<br>
change their ways, and learn to coexist with their fellow human beings.<br>
As much as I dislike communitarians, you won't ever see me killing<br>
somebody just for holding that belief.<br>
