Yes !!! But my only "fear" is about facts like:<br>
<p>
1) In the beginind of XX century, some priests and protestant leaders made<br>
people believe that world would finish...and believers...: really<br>
believed... Will they repeat it in XXI ?? Or are they already doing it ?...<br>
<p>
2) Recently, even this pope, Carol Wojtila, apparently menthally<br>
equilibrated, said that a certain bishop of a protestant religion was the<br>
beast itself ... Bishop Macedo of the Universal Church of The Kingdom of God<br>
was turning the minds of lots of catholics to his church... That was an<br>
irresponsible affirmation since the beast would just come when supposed (<br>
and taugh...) end would be near... <br>
