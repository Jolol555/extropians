	Glad to hear it. I didn't meen to imply that no one here uses PGP. <br>
PGP can be useful on an open list to confirm the sender's identity via<br>
signature.  Otherwise, anyone can log into the server's SMTP port and send<br>
out fake mail masquerading as that sender... and that's the moderately<br>
knowlegeable hacker. The newbie hacker will just configure<br>
Netscape/IE/Eudora/Outlook with a fake originating address and voila! I'm<br>
years from being important enough to impersonate, but I figure I'll start<br>
covering my butt early.<br>
	In any case, people should seriously consider PGP regardless of<br>
what list they're on, regardless of whether they are an industrial spy or<br>
a school teacher. By their very nature, threats to one's privacy are hard<br>
to predict. After all, one doesn't lock one's door only on nights when one<br>
is expecting to be robbed, right? <br>
	I know the above ideas are old hat to the Cypherpunks on the list;<br>
I'm going into this because, as you put it,<br>
 <br>

<p>
	Yup, and the beauty of it is, it's not a loophole they can close<br>
without repealing or crippling the first ammendment. Here's the rub,<br>
though: whether or not other countries already have PGP, it's _still_<br>
illegal to export it from the United States in digital form. These guys<br>
just don't know when to give up! <br>
	By the way, did they actually compile it yet? Are there sites<br>
outside the US where PGP can now be downloaded legally?<br>
<p>
	While we're on the subject... is there anyone out there who uses<br>
Pine as their email client? It took me a while to come up with a<br>
convenient way to integrate PGP with pine, and I want to save other people<br>
the hassle. Contact me individually if you want the scripts. <br>
