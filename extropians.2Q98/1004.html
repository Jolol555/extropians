the<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;HUH?  Perhaps you have missed the evolution of this thread.  So I will</i><br>
try to<br>
<i>&gt;repeat it in brief:</i><br>
<p>
&lt;some snippage of brief&gt;<br>
<p>
Oh.  Well, we can do this another way, then.<br>
If people are willing to buy stock (either on<br>
credit, or from what they now make), then I've<br>
no problem with this, though you might find<br>
it difficult at first to get a loan officer to lend<br>
money for "investment".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So why not allow everyone who is automated out of a those jobs (i.e. </i><br>
<i>&gt;laid off) become shareholders in the company?  </i><br>
<p>
No problem.  You can become such a shareholder <br>
now.  However, if you just *give* them the shares,<br>
that percentage of the company's worth must come<br>
from someone else's share.  Now, it is true that <br>
after the automation the capital assets of the <br>
company are worth more, but the same people<br>
who got the shares should have paid for the <br>
automation, else the money comes from someone<br>
who received no return on it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And since when is </i><br>
<i>&gt;owning some stock in a company equivalent to a devaluation of same?</i><br>
<p>
It is only a devaluation if you arbitrarily<br>
increase the shares, with no more actual<br>
worth.  This is the same as monetary<br>
inflation, but in shares.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More importantly, if people are on the street with no money, they can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;contribute to the economy except through begging.  With some invested</i><br>
income<br>
<i>&gt;they can at least buy YOUR products and services and perhaps make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;contribution back to society.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but if you just *give* them the "invested income",<br>
then they are buying your goods from you with your<br>
money; that is, you are just giving away everything<br>
that they can buy with what the invested income <br>
brings to them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or are you sugesting that as more and more of the economy becomes</i><br>
automated<br>
<i>&gt;less and less people are needed both as employees and consumers.  So at</i><br>
this<br>
<i>&gt;point one must ask why is their an economy at all if it isn't there to</i><br>
serve<br>
<i>&gt;the people?  What is the point of a business if there are no </i><br>
<i>&gt;customers?</i><br>
<p>
*I* am not suggesting this.  Dunno about James Rogers.<br>
As the economy becomes automated, we will all be able<br>
to buy and use more or improved products.  <br>
