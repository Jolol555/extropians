Sure, as long as its free enough for me to go nuke anyone who steals my<br>
property....remember, I'm with the Force Doctrine camp as the source of human<br>
rights. Whether I do it personally or have my government representatives do<br>
it for me by proxy does not matter.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is about as logical as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;manufacturer only getting paid for some of the product he makes, i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; not somthing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which should be legislated or forced on someone. Product for which a</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is not paid, and which he does not willingly donate to charity or give</i><br>
<i>&gt; away is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;STOLEN. GET IT?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem with "stealing" information is that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; sooo difficult to show the missing information, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; it isn't.  As long as you still have something, I haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; stolen it.</i><br>
<p>
See my other post. Unfortunately, you are talking to someone who knows about<br>
this market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Also, you are still ignoring my question as to why I or anyone should</i><br>
<i>&gt; invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;something to benefit others without our say so as to who can benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; freely from it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and who pays. Anything less is theft.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; After you sell any other product, you don't insist that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue to own it and can decide who gets it next, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; why with information?</i><br>
<p>
I don't sell my invention, I rent its use. A lease agreement (license) is not<br>
a bill of sale.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;All you are doing is akin to an attempt to legislate PI to equal 3. Get</i><br>
<i>&gt; off your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;subjectivist, post modern butt and pay for what you use. No free</i><br>
<i>&gt; lunches.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not even for monopolists, right?  I could go with that...</i><br>
<p>
If inventions were monopolies, you might be right. However as any engineer<br>
can tell you, there are always many ways to solve a problem. Only problems<br>
are unique. Therefore, any one invention is not in a monopoly position in a<br>
market. (contrary to popular beleif, Windows is not a monopoly, no matter<br>
what the government says. As there are many other operating systems out there<br>
that can be used, that anyone can choose from freely, Microsoft forces no one<br>
to buy their product.)<br>
