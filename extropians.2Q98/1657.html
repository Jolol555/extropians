I read this last night.  Thanks for the reference, Keith.  This is a very good<br>
article and primed my appetite even more to read Wilson's new book,<br>
"Consilience" (just as soon as I finish David Brin's "The Transparent Society"<br>
and Jim Halperin's "The First Immortal" -- which I need to do before I'm on<br>
the same podium with them in 2 weeks!).<br>
<p>
I was also fascinated by the interview with Wilson I found at the Atlantic's<br>
website.  Wilson seems to be on the same wavelength as many of us here; that<br>
we are on the verge of a "New Enlightenment".  He very explicitly states that<br>
the best course for our civilization is a conscious revisitation of the<br>
program of the Enlightenment of the 18th Century.  However, I found his deep<br>
biological conservatism quite surprising.  Wilson states quite explicitly that<br>
he expects genetic alteration of the human form to stop at the eradication of<br>
disease, that human progress will, for some unstated reasons, slow down, that<br>
we will become engrossed with an immutable "human nature" and that we will not<br>
pursue space colonization.  All these ideas seem utterly inconsistent with his<br>
clear view of the evolutionary basis of human nature and also incompatible<br>
with the Enlightenment's valuation of an ideal of progress.  Has anyone read<br>
"Consilience" yet and, if so, does he rationalize this surprising conservatism<br>
there?<br>
