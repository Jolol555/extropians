<i>&gt;humans, guts riddled with bacteria. I'll resurrect them completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;without any bacteria, then they will be healthy and happy!").</i><br>
<p>
I think al this can be solved in principle. The question is only <br>
how much time it requires. I think that all intelligent sentient <br>
beings can be detected in principle. Of course I can't prove that. <br>
This would equal creating a formal definition of sentience, which <br>
nobody has been able to do yet. <br>
<p>
You could for example record al the intermediate states of the <br>
simulation. (When the simulation is deterministic you wouldn't <br>
even have to do that. You would only have to remember the <br>
beginning state of the simulation and its total duration.)<br>
<p>
Then afterwards, the creator could in principle examine the <br>
simulation in detail. Dependable on the complexity of the <br>
sentient beings he wants to detect this examination could <br>
take a time extremely much longer than the duration of the <br>
simulation itself. The question is only, does it take longer <br>
than time the creator will exist.<br>
<p>
I expect it will not be that difficult for the creator to <br>
detect sentient lifeforms in simulations. For example it <br>
is also not so difficult for humans to detect selfreplicating <br>
systems and moving systems in the "game of life". Of course <br>
these current universes are much to small to create sentient <br>
or even intelligent beings. <br>
<p>
<p>

But you could learn...<br>

<i>&gt; This reasoning presumes that reproducing sentient beings will at one </i><br>

<p>
Systems in "game of life" worlds can alter their surroundings. <br>
When they do this in an indirect way, this could be considered <br>
using tools. I don't see why tools can't also exist in "game of life" <br>
worlds.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Third, the afterlife is rather underdetermined: how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;keep the entities from pain *there*?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When the entities are restored in a separate simulation there </i><br>
<i>&gt; is now no reason anymore not to communicate with them. So the </i><br>
<i>&gt; creator could ask the sentient beings themselves if they are happy </i><br>
<i>&gt; or not. Or even give them the capabilities to alter themselves </i><br>
<i>&gt; in to a state they individually prefer.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This assumes we can easily communicate with them. But how do we start</i><br>
<i>&gt;exchanging communication with entities with a fundamentally extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt;different world </i><br>
<p>
I didn't assume it should be very easy. But it shouldn't be to hard <br>
to communicate with other intelligent sentient beings. We will have <br>
enough in common. It should be just as hard as communicating with <br>
any other intelligent sentient lifeform.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(like Tierrans, with a world consisting of computing</i><br>
<i>&gt;nodes and nonlocal memory indexed by templates and energy appearing if</i><br>
<i>&gt;you do certain things but not other things)? </i><br>
<p>
Interesting, where can I find more about these Tierrans?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think it can be done, but it would be extremely hard to do, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;the process might be rather painful for the entities again (imagine </i><br>
<i>&gt;being resurrected all alone in a weird caricature of the real world </i><br>
<i>&gt;where *something* tries to communicate with you - and if you die, </i><br>
<i>&gt;you are immediately resurrected).</i><br>
<p>
The idea was they would be resurrected together with other <br>
individuals form their world. And why should the resurrection <br>
world be made a weird caricature of their real world. It could <br>
just as well be made as familiar as possible to their real world.<br>
<p>
This whole issue reminds me a bit of the Riverworld saga by <br>
Philip Jose Farmer. Here all the people who have once lived <br>
on Earth are resurrected on another planet along the banks <br>
of an extremely long river. The river is spiraling the whole <br>
surface of the planet and the river valleys are separated <br>
by insurmountable mountains. The people are restored with full <br>
health in 25 year old bodies. When killed they will <br>
immediately be resurrected at another location. I enjoyed these <br>
books very much. :-&gt;<br>
