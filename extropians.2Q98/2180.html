<i>&gt;Has anyone looked at the results poll?</i><br>
<p>
Yes!  I even voted.  I actually think online polls are an interesting<br>
new vector for the spread of extropian memes, provided you can get a<br>
group of likeminded friends to crash the poll. Everyone knows they're<br>
not scientific, but still... people can't help looking at those things<br>
and thinking, "Hmm... so this is what everyone thinks, huh?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The majority wants to be around in</i><br>
<i>&gt;2200, yet only a minority would be cryonically frozen after death</i><br>
even<br>
<i>&gt;if financing it wasn't an issue.  What other option is there to live</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;the year 2200 *after you've died*???</i><br>
<p>
After you've died, probably none (though not necessarily -- the<br>
"Universal Immortalists" think we'll eventually be able to revive<br>
anyone who's ever lived). But that particular question wasn't<br>
specifically saying "after you've died". I think it is quite possible<br>
that many of us will get there simply by gaining access to good life<br>
extension technology in the next few decades.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe the public just needs to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;better educated... when's Halperin's miniseries going to be aired?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think there's a definite air date yet, but you can probably<br>
keep track of it by monitoring <a href="http://www.firstimmortal.com">http://www.firstimmortal.com</a>.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also interesting is that all the names I saw were extropians: Robin</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hanson, Ralph Merckle, and Kennita Watson.</i><br>
<p>
Well, Ralph's list (from www.merkle.com) lists only extropians, as far<br>
as I can tell. The guy seemed to get almost all his info from Merkle's<br>
page (not that he did a good job even at that... more on this below).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;These people were classified</i><br>
<i>&gt;as "nerds."  Is that a fair classification?   From just reading the</i><br>
<i>&gt;contributions of these 3 extropians, "nerd" is not a word that pops</i><br>
into<br>
<i>&gt;my mind.  I always think of a nerd as someone who spends their time</i><br>
<i>&gt;exercising their mind at the expense of their body-- a pretty</i><br>
unextropian<br>
<i>&gt;thing to do if you ask me... hardly a good path to physical</i><br>
immortality.<br>
<p>
"Nerd" and "Geek" have both undergone serious makeovers in the past<br>
decade. I think they both used to be pure pejoratives, but now many<br>
wear the labels with pride. Intelligence, education, and technical<br>
sophistication are sexier than ever.<br>
<p>
And many folks in the extropian community are striving to add even<br>
more to these connotations. We are the Uber-Nerds! Wanna hack some<br>
code? Let's go! Wanna analyze the latest findings on the frontiers of<br>
physics? We're down? Wanna pump some iron and knock out some pushups?<br>
You betcha!<br>
<p>
What can't we do? Of what are we not capable?<br>
<p>
I ask you!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I remember Anders Sandberg classifying himself as a nerd.  Why was</i><br>
that?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another point mentioned by the writer is that of the 26 people he</i><br>
found<br>
<i>&gt;signed up for cryonics, only 1 was female... is that a representative</i><br>
<i>&gt;figure? Does anyone have Alcor stats to support this gender gap?</i><br>
<p>
Not representative at all, not even representative of Merkle's sample<br>
of 26. On that list, the guy missed Ailing Freeman, Terry Stanley, and<br>
Chris Peterson, dynamic fem-geeks all, and quite representative of the<br>
kind of babes you can find within our community.<br>
<p>
This is not say that we're swimming with females in the cryonics and<br>
extropian communities, but the ratio isn't as bad as it used to be. In<br>
Alcor, I believe the ratio is something like 33/67 female/male. Max<br>
might have figures for ExI.<br>
<p>
The real problem, of course, is that so many of them are already<br>
spoken for, romantically speaking. But if its just the female touch<br>
you're looking for, it is all around us, and it is MARVELOUS!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A recommend extropians take the poll and skew their results-- maybe</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;will alter the tone of articles like this one, where cryonicists and</i><br>
<i>&gt;physical immortalists are treated as a bizarre and insignificant</i><br>
fringe,<br>
<i>&gt;and good fodder for silly jokes about a post-apocalyptic Planet of</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;Nerds.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Geoff.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
<p>
I wrote an email to the author of the piece (and copied it to the<br>
letters to the editor email address). Leaving aside the tone of the<br>
article, he got a number of facts just plain wrong, even just in<br>
regard to his reading of Merkle's page. Never mind that a little<br>
research on other pages would have given him a much better view of the<br>
real cryonics community. (We're not all in California, we're not all<br>
nerds, and a good deal more than 1/26 of us are female.) It will be<br>
interesting to see whether a correction is printed.<br>
