<i>&gt;We imagine that you make a variety of goods, and this demand curve</i><br>
<i>&gt;represents the demand for all the different goods you might make in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitive market.  OK, now suppose you invent something new.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;invention is a "sunk cost": it does not add to your marginal costs (see</i><br>
<i>&gt;below) and so it does not change the shape of your supply curve.  (This may</i><br>
<i>&gt;not necessarily be true; making a sensor may be more costly the other goods</i><br>
<i>&gt;which you make currently, or it may be cheaper.  However, because the</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect is ambiguous, we can presume that it doesn't change your supply</i><br>
<i>&gt;curve.  Even if it does, this doesn't affect my argument.)  Nonetheless, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;DOES increase the demand for your goods, since you now attract new buyers</i><br>
<i>&gt;who want to buy your new product.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree that a 'sunk cost' does not add to production costs, but it sure<br>
DOES affect my ultimate profits!<br>
<p>
The 'sunk cost' needs to be covered BEFORE I can realize profits on my<br>
invention. Otherwise, there is no point in the whole process - if I can<br>
never recocver my R+D costs, why should I even think of creating something?<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;      |    \_</i><br>

<i>&gt;Price |\_      \_   _/ &lt;-- supply</i><br>

<i>&gt;      |/      |   |  \       \  &lt;--- new demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;      ---------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;              Q*  Q**</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Quantity    </i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
<i>&gt;Where P** and Q** are the new price and quantity.  As this graph shows, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;reap increased revenues thanks to the invention, even under a market where</i><br>
<i>&gt;you don't have copyright protection.  To be specific, you reap extra</i><br>
<i>&gt;revenues given by the trapezoid formed by the y-axis, the old price line,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the supply curve and the new price line.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Only if the demand magically expands to suck up all I produce. Look at what<br>
happened to DRAM makers recently due to huge increases in supply in a finite<br>
market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So what did I mean by externalities?  Well, just as your firm will receive</i><br>
<i>&gt;the money in that trapezoid, so will all other firms who produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;"knock-offs."  You will all EACH receive the quantity inside that</i><br>
<i>&gt;trapezoid.  Thus, invention has positive externalities on other suppliers.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
How can all my 'knock off' competition also collect the SAME amount given a<br>
fixed market? If there is the possibility of selling X products, and you<br>
double the number of vendors, the profits available are X devided by each<br>
competitor's market share. Anything else is a pyrimid scheme.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Meanwhile, it IS worthwhile to pay for invention, even if the invention is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not protected with a government monopoly, if the area inside your trapezoid</i><br>
<i>&gt;is equal to or greater than the cost of invention.  Indeed, the larger your</i><br>
<i>&gt;stake in the market, the more worthwhile invention is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
That is true. As long as my profits exceed my costs, I will keep on<br>
producing, regardless of competition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If I set my prices arbitrarily high, I limit my sales to those for whom</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;money is no object. This is a very small market. If I charge a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;price for my invention, based on its' costs and a fair payment to me for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;development, I should have more takers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's look at what you're saying economically.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You correctly point out that if you set the price arbitrarily high, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;won't have as many takers as if you set the price somewhat lower.  I agree</i><br>
<i>&gt;with this; monopolies do not get to set their own revenues, they only get</i><br>
<i>&gt;to set the market price without worrying about competitors.  So we imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you demand curve looks like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Price |\__                              </i><br>
<i>&gt;      |   \__               </i><br>
<i>&gt;      |      \__        </i><br>
<i>&gt;      |         \__                          </i><br>
<i>&gt;      |            \__       </i><br>
<i>&gt;      |               \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;      |                  \__</i><br>
<i>&gt;      |                      \  &lt;-- demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;      -----------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<i>&gt;             Quantity</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, because you are the only source of this particular good, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;represent the entire market for that good.  This means that each time you</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to increase quantity by one, you have to lower the price slightly.  As</i><br>
<i>&gt;a result, the marginal revenue (MR, or the revenue you get from selling one</i><br>
<i>&gt;more of your product) for a monopoly is actually LOWER than the demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;curve, and looks like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Why must I lower the price? Where is this rule posted?  I don't see<br>
Volkswagen, who has a 'monopoly' on their New Beetle, lowering the price<br>
sequentially on each car they sell..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The profit maximization rule for firms state that you should continue to</i><br>
<i>&gt;produce goods until your marginal costs are equal to or greater than your</i><br>
<i>&gt;marginal revenue; in order words, that you should make one more if the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt;of one more is less than the revenues which it will make for you.  A normal</i><br>
<i>&gt;firm will find this point when the supply curve intersects the demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;curve, because for most firms, the demand curve IS the marginal revenue</i><br>
<i>&gt;curve.  Monopolies, on the other hand, have a lower MR curve, and thus will</i><br>
<i>&gt;set their quantity lower than a regular firm.  Unfortunately for consumers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;however, the PRICE a monopoly can charge for a given quantity is given by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the demand curve, not by the marginal revenue curve.  So what we see is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that monopolies, when acting in such a way as to maximize their profits,</i><br>
<i>&gt;will set prices higher than a competitive firm would, and produce a smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt;quantity, thus:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I am going to excise the graphs in the interest of bandwidth. You know what<br>
you drew..<br>
<p>
Why does a monopoly have a lower MR curve? Just because you are the only<br>
supplier, this does not affect the DEMAND for your product. Demand is quite<br>
different from sales. Many might like to purchase a product but refrain<br>
because the cost is too high. The demand is there, but sales lag. Once the<br>
artificailly high price is lowered (and this DOES NOT mean that you sell<br>
below cost!) the sales will increase. If you cut costs even further, sales<br>
will increase to the limit of the real demand. If this happens before you<br>
run out of margin and production capacity, you make lots of money. If you<br>
run out of supply before you can sell everything demanded, the demand does<br>
not disappear, but raising your price will surely cause more customers to<br>
back off and wait..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where P* and Q* are the price and quantity which would be reached by a free</i><br>
<i>&gt;market, and P and Q are the price and quantity which a monopoly would</i><br>
<i>&gt;choose to maximize profits.  (I recognize that it's hard to read...  Try</i><br>
<i>&gt;drawing it on paper or something.)  When we keep in mind that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;consumers' surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the price</i><br>
<i>&gt;line, whereas the monopoly's surplus is the area above the supply curve and</i><br>
<i>&gt;below the price line, it is clear that by setting the prices this high, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;firms are benefitting at the expense of the consumers.  Worse, we also note</i><br>
<i>&gt;that because this quantity is lower than it would be under a free market</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is "deadweight loss" (the wealth which would have been created if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;market were free), represented by the area inside the triangle bounded by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the demand curve, the supply curve and the quantity line.  The part of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;triangle above the price line is that surplus which would have been earned</i><br>
<i>&gt;by consumers; the part below this triangle is that which would have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;earned by firms.  Firms will happily sacrifice this triangle, however, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can gain the rectangle formed by the y-axis, the monopoly price, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;quantity line, and the competitive price.  The revenues in that rectangle</i><br>
<i>&gt;outweigh the revenues in the triangle.</i><br>
<p>
In a free market, will goods magically appear to fill all the holes? There<br>
are going to be second order effects - lags in development, tooling, etc.<br>
that will prevent the market from being fully satisfied at least in the<br>
beginning of sales of a new invention. Some 'profit' will always be<br>
unreaped. This 'loss' is an imaginary quantity, since there is no way to<br>
EVER recover it, unless you posit 'thought to production' technology..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is why monopolies are bad:  they are REALLY bad for consumers, since</i><br>
<i>&gt;they go from reaping the entire area under the demand curve and above the</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitive price line to only getting the much smaller area below the</i><br>
<i>&gt;demand curve and above the monopolistic price line.  Moreover, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;also bad for the wealth of society as a whole, because the deadweight loss</i><br>
<i>&gt;represents commerce which COULD have contributed to economic growth for</i><br>
<i>&gt;everybody, but won't, because the monopolistic firm is profit maximizing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The monopoly is only bad for consumers if it refuses to listen to the<br>
customer's wants and needs. If the company cares about it's customers, they<br>
will adjust their products to fit what the amrket wants. If this is the<br>
case, other firms will find ways to produce equivalent product that<br>
sidesteps the patent, and satisfy the true wants of the market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, to answer your point directly:  Yes, you won't set your price</i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrarily high; instead, you'll set your price just high enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt;squeeze profits out of the consumers at the expense of everybody else,</i><br>
<i>&gt;hurting everyone by hurting the consumers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
See above. Personally, I am not a robber baron. I just want to keep OTHER<br>
robber barons from profiting from my work until I can recover my 'sunk costs'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;In the case of our products, the market is fairly small and specialized. One</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;competitior stealing our ideas and undercutting us would ruin the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;works for us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If your product isn't worth making under a competitive price, but is only</i><br>
<i>&gt;worthwhile under government protection, maybe you should rethink whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;the product is worth making at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If the competitive price is arrived at by allowing anyone who happens along<br>
to steal my idea, I might as well stay out of the market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The rewards are for the initial creation of the information, not knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of same. You seem to be saying that the creators deserve no rewards for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;their thinking!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't understand what you're saying here.  As you surely know if you've</i><br>
<i>&gt;read my other posts on this topic, I DO think that creaters deserve rewards</i><br>
<i>&gt;for inventing, I just don't think they deserve monopoly status on the idea.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It's pretty hard to reap profits BEFORE you sell a product, unless there's<br>
some fairy godmother of a government agency that pays me for the<br>
development, then lets anyone who cares to make the gadget! We have enough<br>
handouts now!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;You still benefit from the invention in the form of the new market you've</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;just created or in the increased demand for your products.  The fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;your competitor will also benefit does not detract from this.  Thus, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;long as you still make a profit from the invention, it's still worthwhile</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;to pay for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I beg to differ. As I stated earlier, if the market is small, you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;seriously harmed by knock-off competetion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, if you need the coerced profits in the rectangle in order to stay</i><br>
<i>&gt;afloat, then maybe you should be rethinking the value of your product in</i><br>
<i>&gt;general.  And as I think I have shown, you DO benefit from invention, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;when other people are allowed to compete with you for your products.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Again, you are confusing a limited supply with infinity! If there is a<br>
demand for X products, and the knock-off guy can make them for less than I<br>
can, because I have 'sunk costs' to amortize, I am dead. The customers will<br>
naturally buy his product and pass mine by - after all, there is no<br>
difference if his quality matches mine! If he makes a cheap imitation, I<br>
still may be dead if he succeeds in selling long enough for me to starve to<br>
death, or if he poisons the market.<br>
<p>
I get no benefit from a given market if my costs prevent me from selling at<br>
a profit. Period.<br>
