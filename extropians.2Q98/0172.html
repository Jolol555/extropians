<p>
What is the difference between artificial happiness and the real thing?<br>
Can someone be happy and still be in terribly difficult and painful<br>
circumstances?  That seems a bit contradictory.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the real difficulty here is the difficulty of knowing what the<br>
true mental state is.  Obviously, creating someone with a fixed smile<br>
on their face is no indication that they are actually happy.  Even if we<br>
have good general understanding of genetics it may be much longer before<br>
we can say with confidence that a particular design will lead to a happy<br>
being, one which does not suffer.<br>
<p>
Still, in terms of judging morality, I'd say we have to use our best<br>
understanding of these matters, just as in other areas of uncertainty.<br>
We may want to err on the side of caution, in which case creating beings<br>
with drastically new mental structures could be considered immoral,<br>
since we might unknowingly create a being who was constantly in terrible<br>
pain, and who (of course) never volunteered to undergo that experience.<br>
This would obviously hinder the growth of understanding the mind and<br>
brain, but it would be wrong to gain knowledge at the cost of involuntary<br>
suffering by others.<br>
