I don't know, I like to think so.<br>

            <br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure Lao Tzu would be interested is some of the things we talk <br>
about and I'd certainly love to hear what he thought about them, to a lesser <br>
degree the same is true of Buddha. Kabir didn't have the intellectual <br>
firepower of a Lao Tzu but I'll bet he was a nice person, almost a <br>
libertarian, can't say the same for his later followers, the Sikhs. It's hard <br>
to say anything meaningful about Krishna, his incarnations seem contradictory <br>
and it gets mighty confusing, I can't help thinking of him as a cartoon <br>
character. If Socrates were on the list I doubt if I'd agree with him much, <br>
but I would value him because the man was intelligent, knew how to argue, and <br>
he had the ability to laugh at himself. If Jesus or Mohammed subscribed I'd <br>
put them in my kill file along with the $$ MAKE BIG MONEY NOW $$  people.    <br>
