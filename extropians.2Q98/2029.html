quantum,<br>

<p>
I did not want to go classical to quantum without due cause, as it is an <br>
intellectual arms race, but once you start referring to particles as <br>
having individual wavelengths, you are talking quantum, and I must <br>
respond like Pakistan.  My apologies.<br>
    The easiest way to point out the problems with finding an exact <br>
position is wavelength is the notorious Heisenberg uncertainty <br>
principle. I almost hesitate to bring it up as it is the only element of <br>
quantum physics that has made it into pop physics, (along with e=mc^2 <br>
and that bit about Galileo dropping things off the Tower of Pisa)and <br>
thus is the most misunderstood theorum of quantum physics, as all the <br>
others are merely unknown.  This is not because it is complex, it is <br>
because people tell lies about it (or perhaps .2 Truths).  <br>
Unfortunately I have no mathematical symbols at my disposal, so words <br>
must do.<br>
<p>
The uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to precisely <br>
measure a particle's momentum and position simultaneously.  If one is <br>
measured precisely, the other becomes unbounded.  This has practical <br>
significance towards the question of whether a photon is or is not blue <br>
according to whether it lies within the range of 540-560 nm. As the <br>
wavelength of the photon may lie arbitrarily close to the cutoff point <br>
of 540 nm, the wavelength must be specified to infinite precision. The <br>
wavelength of a photon is determined by the relationship x=h/E, where x <br>
is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and E is energy.  I will <br>
further translate E into mc^2(which describes all aspects of momentum <br>
but the direction).  x=h/mc^2.     Planck's constant is constant, as is <br>
the speed of light.  The wavelength is therefore determined by the mass <br>
variable.  The observational task at hand is to pin down the mass to <br>
infinite precision so that it can be determined whether or not the <br>
stated photon is or is not blue.  However, once you have accomplished <br>
this the position of the photon becomes unbounded!  Since the photon is <br>
just as likely to be in the Andromeda galaxy as on the surface of the <br>
Earth, I do not think it possible to draw any conclusions about the <br>
color of the sky from your precise measurement of wavelength.<br>
In practice both precision and momentum can be constrained to a very <br>
small range, although there is always a remote possibility (assuming <br>
non-infinite precision of momentum) that a photon emitted from your <br>
flashlight will end up in the Andromeda Galaxy. In our blueness <br>
defintion this suggests that there is actually some ambiguity at every <br>
wavelength, although in most cases infitesimally small.  We can perceive <br>
blue because the cones in our eyes are tolerant to small fluctuation of <br>
wavelength,and the sheer number of photons that enter our eyes make <br>
precise positions unimportant due to statistical mass.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The change </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; over time destroys any attempt at certainty.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hardly.  We can see this from a macroscopic example: if I lead you in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;simple waltz on the Mexican border facing north, my left foot will be </i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt;America during the first measure and in Mexico on 2 and 3 of the second</i><br>
<i>&gt;measure.  (Ignore the fence.)  It will truly be wherever it is at any</i><br>
<i>&gt;given time, however. </i><br>
<p>
The question is not the truth value at points well within boundries. It <br>
is what truth value to prescribe exactly at the border.  I will not try <br>
to extend the analogy to your macroscopic example,as feet are not point <br>
particles and will overlap the border.  Photons, when well behaving, are <br>
point particles and do not cause this sort of confusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;       In fact, it seems that allowing for a discrete range of </i><br>
blueness <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; has made the ambiguity twice as bad.  If blue was defined as light </i><br>
with <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a wavelength of 550nm, at almost every point the Tarskian truth value </i><br>
of <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the statement 'le laser est bleu' would be false, except at 550nm </i><br>
which <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would be ambigous.  By creating a range, there is an area of clear </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; truth, clear falsehood, and TWO ambigous points.  It does not seem to </i><br>
me <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that Tarskian logic is the path to finding absolute truth if there </i><br>
are <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; necesarily ambiguities wherever one tries to draw boundries. Indeed, </i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; only way to create a genuinely universal Tarskian logic statement </i><br>
would <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; be by defining blue as being the set of all wavelengths, i.e., an </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; infinite statement.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As noted, in light of the above definition, this discussion of </i><br>
ambiguity<br>
<i>&gt;is fishy.  Since particles have a discrete location at a given time, </i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt;since their instantaneous velocities ARE given by calculus, there's no</i><br>
<i>&gt;ambiguity at all on the Newtonian scale.</i><br>
 <br>
  Unfortunately Newtonian physics had to be abandoned because it does <br>
not adequately explain the behavior of light (and other things, but <br>
light was the initial problem).  Your explanation works slightly better <br>
because it is not Newtonian.  Photons cannot have frequencies <br>
independent of other photons within Newtonian physics.<br>
<p>
       The gist of my argument is that when attempting to map all <br>
statements (in a metalanguage) onto the world, wherever boundries are <br>
drawn there will be fundamentally unavoidable ambiguities.  At some <br>
point (in this case at the points of 540 and 560 nm), it will be <br>
impossible to give a truth value of either true or false.  I suppose if <br>
you insist on maintaining the Tarskian diagram, you could say "le laser <br>
est bleu' is Truly True or False, but I don't think this is what Tarsky <br>
had in mind! If you find multivalence truly abhorrent, I find no <br>
objection to making a Tarskian diagram with three Truth values, True, <br>
False, and Ambiguous (or Not Applicable).  However, as I pointed out <br>
above, the uncertainty principle would make Ambiguous the correct Truth <br>
value at every point (each photon may or may not be blue). While <br>
accurate, it doesn't do much good to anybody.<br>
You could get around the problem of Ambiguity by redefining blue in <br>
terms of complex numbers, but your new defintion would not bear any <br>
relation to what anybody else thought of as blue.<br>
