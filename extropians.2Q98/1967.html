<p>
  IAN: Alas, a skillful counter, <br>
  thanks! But here's the holism:<br>
<p>
  Change of piano location in room<br>
  or rooms (C = change, 0 = no change):<br>
<p>
            Shape   Location<br>
   -Piano:    C        0<br>
    Piano:    0        C<br>
<p>
  Because the location of a thing is an<br>
  identity attribute of it, the identity<br>
  of the piano changes to the extent that<br>
  its location changes; and, changing the <br>
  L of P changes the S of -P, which maps <br>
  the their holistic-identity structure.<br>
<p>
  So long as a change to A scores any<br>
  change to -A, we have mapped holism.<br>
  In fact, a change to A that did not <br>
  result in a change to -A would still<br>
  map holism!, since the "not-change" <br>
  is defined by the change. It seems<br>
  to me that holism can never fail,<br>
  and is thus an absolute truth.<br>
<p>
  Notice that the location of -P refers <br>
  only to the empty space as defined by <br>
  P and the walls. The location of the <br>
  room and its walls could be said to <br>
  change by moving the piano around.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or similarly, the numeral zero on the integer scale and the numeral</i><br>
<i>&gt;zero on the rationals are both the same - the integers are a subset</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the rationals after all.  However, not zero in either case is</i><br>
<i>&gt;different.</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: I don't see how this applies. We have<br>
  two things with one similar trait, 0. Each<br>
  thing is defined as a "different thing" by<br>
  relation to the other, and all members of <br>
  each thing are defined by their relations.<br>
