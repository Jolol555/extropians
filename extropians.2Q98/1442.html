<i>        &gt;The Schrodinger equation is entirely deterministic. </i><br>
          <br>
That's true. Non determinism enters Quantum Mechanics because the Schrodinger <br>
equation does not describe something in the real world, something concrete <br>
like a position or a momentum, it describes the square root of a probability.<br>
<p>

True again, small changes in input do not lead to huge changes in output.<br>

<p>
<i>           &gt;Not without the help of a computer operator.</i><br>
<p>
Nonsense, millions of people use computers successfully without the slightest <br>
understanding of how they work.<br>
         <br>

<p>
<i>        &gt;In some worlds, perhaps so. But it depends on your definition of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;intelligence. </i><br>
<p>
Definitions alone are of no value in philosophy, just words describing words  <br>
that are themselves made of nothing but words. A Dictionary is one big <br>
circular definition.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Viruses seem quite robust, yet they don't demonstrate any equivalent         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;intelligence to that of say, the average extropian.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Viruses don't need brains because their bodies are astronomically better at <br>
spreading their genes that human bodies are. Even compared to other mammals <br>
human bodies are inferior, our endurance is good but we're slow, weak, and <br>
our teeth and claws are a joke. If our brain were no better than other <br>
mammals we'd be long extinct, as it is we're the most common large animal on <br>
earth.<br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;&gt;random mutation and natural selection bother to make anything         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;sentient?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It may turn out that life indeed finds sentience to be an         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;unprofitable experiment.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Irrelevant. Evolution has no foresight, each mutation must confer a <br>
reproductive advantage NOW or natural selection will not let it persist into <br>
future generations. If sentience were not an inevitable product of <br>
intelligence it would have never have evolved, and even if by some magic it <br>
did genetic drift would not let us keep it, it would wither away as all <br>
useless appendages do, just as the eyes of fish that have lived in dark caves <br>
for millions of years did.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;I know for a fact that evolution did bother to make at least one         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;thing conscious.</i><br>
            <br>
<i>       &gt;There you go again. You say no test exists to determine consciousness</i><br>
    <br>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;yet you claim that it nevertheless exists.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes. I need no test because my consciousness is one thing, the only thing, <br>
that I have direct experience of, it's above logic, even if you had an  <br>
impeccable proof that I was not conscious I wouldn't be impressed. On the <br>
other hand, I do need a test of your consciousness, but I don't have one and <br>
never will.                                    <br>
