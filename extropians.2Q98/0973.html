if theft is okay, for people who've been laid off, then<br>
why not have them do it themselves?&gt;&gt;<br>

HUH?  Perhaps you have missed the evolution of this thread.  So I will try to<br>
repeat it in brief:<br>
<p>
The Scenario is that before we reach productive nanotech, the economy becomes<br>
so productive and efficient through automation that people become superfluous.<br>
So why not allow everyone who is automated out of a those jobs (i.e. layed off)<br>
become shareholders in the company?  And since when is owning some stock in a<br>
company equivalent to a devaluation of same?<br>
<p>
More importantly, if people are on the street with no money, they can't<br>
contribute to the economy except through begging.  With some invested income<br>
they can at least buy YOUR products and services and perhaps make a<br>
contribution back to society.<br>
<p>
Or are you sugesting that as more and more of the economy becomes automated<br>
less and less people are needed both as employees and consumers.  So at this<br>
point one must ask why is their an economy at all if it isn't there to serve<br>
the people?  What is the point of a business if there are no customers?<br>
<p>
What is your alternative?  To let them eat cake? To die off?<br>
<p>
