In an earlier post Damien Broderick voiced the opinion that there might be a<br>
problem in the transistion period between todays market based economy and<br>
tomorrows replicator based economy.  He speculated that a type of gauranteed<br>
minimiuim might be useful to ease the transition.<br>
<p>
I found the following information to be interesting in that regard.<br>

A MEDICARE MUTUAL INSURANCE SYSTEM<br>
<p>
A mutual insurance model for a new Medicare system is proposed by <br>
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), and Texas A&amp; M University economists <br>
Andrew J. Rettenmaier and Thomas R. Saving in the New England <br>
Journal of Medicine.<br>
<p>
They propose that over a 50-year transition period, Medicare be <br>
changed from a transfer payment system to one in which each age <br>
group -- defined as all the people born in any given year -- <br>
would contribute to an investment fund to pay for the health care <br>
needs of that group in retirement.<br>
<p>
   o   Workers in each age group would pay a set percentage of <br>
       their wages throughout their working lives for health care <br>
       in retirement.<br>
<p>
   o   The annual cumulative funds collected from each age group <br>
       would be divided equally and deposited in each person's <br>
       account to grow until retirement.<br>
<p>
   o   Investment account providers would be subject to <br>
       reasonable requirements with respect to the safety and <br>
       soundness of their portfolios and required to take all <br>
       applicants.<br>
<p>
   o   If a person died before retirement, his contributions <br>
       would be redistributed to other members of the respective <br>
       age group.<br>
<p>
As each age group moves through its life cycle, the contribution <br>
rate would be adjusted to take into account changes in <br>
experience, just as other casualty-insurance rates are now <br>
adjusted.<br>
<p>
Since all workers in an age group would pay the same tax rate, <br>
workers would subsidize nonworkers and high-income workers <br>
subsidize low-wage earners.<br>
<p>
Funding the transition cost from the current tax transfer system <br>
would have a present value cost of about $1.4 trillion, say the <br>
authors, compared to unfunded liabilities under the current <br>
system of $2.7 trillion.  Workers 43 and under would be fully <br>
covered by the new system -- initially paying a higher tax rate <br>
to help fund the Medicare benefits of current retirees and older <br>
workers.  <br>
<p>
The contribution or tax rate on younger workers would fall for <br>
each age group as they accumulated enough funds to pay for their <br>
retirement medical expenses, and the cost of funding <br>
benefits for a shrinking pool of retirees under the old system <br>
fell.<br>
