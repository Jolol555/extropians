The article by Beam on cryonics in located in the Section Living/Arts.<br>
Well, you can imagine how I found the article to be rather kitsch.<br>
<p>
In instances such as this, where the journalist's story is fallible, it<br>
would be good to take action and send letters or e-mail to the Globe.<br>
<p>
Its a poor portrayal of cryonics, a misleading comment about nerds.  The<br>
idea of a nerd has mutated over the past decade.  Where it was once to be<br>
uncool, its reputation changed and has become cool, or cryo, (although I'm<br>
not a nerd nor a geek for that matter.)<br>
<p>
I'm glad that Kennita Watson got some press, as an active cryonicist she<br>
certainly deserves to be mentioned.  Though, I had to laugh about the bad<br>
math in adding up the female cryonicist 'cause cryonics has a lot of female<br>
members (not to mention its founding member Linda Chamberlain -- who<br>
probably would not be considered a nerd (or geek) either.)<br>
<p>
Regardless, I do think that the best response is to make the Globe aware<br>
that it printed an article that was not researched responsibly and it was<br>
under the Section "Living/Arts" rather than "Fiction."<br>
<p>
Alex Beam's e-mail address is beam@globe.com, although I don't have the<br>
address for the Boston Globe, but it shouldn't be hard to find.<br>
