<i>&gt; &gt;actually wouldnt you agree that the ancient greeks and even egyptians</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;had a fairly high level of invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Greeks had the ability, for certain, but their spin on the scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; method was such that they saw no purpose in experimental proof of theories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; After all, once you have figured Nature out in your mind, what point is</i><br>
<i>&gt; there in getting messy by proving the truth? I particularly enjoyed reading</i><br>
<i>&gt; Socrates' arguments for the existence of an immortal soul, based on his own</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal experiences alone. No wonder the rulers of the time sought his</i><br>
<i>&gt; death - he was as far from the pragmatic science of today as possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Their 'inventions' were mostly used as special effects for their temples,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to impress the common folk, or for toys. Persons who actually would dig</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the mess to prove things were looked down on as mere mechanics and</i><br>
<i>&gt; laborers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Egyptians, I don't have good information on. Now I will have to go to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the library again..</i><br>
<p>
All of these, when compared to the societies before, were obviously more<br>
inventive, but remember that they are really only known for a few inventions<br>
that were true advances over what was used before, that were developed over<br>
several hundred years. Comparing this with the over 5 million patents that have<br>
been issued here in the US alone over the past 200 years (mostly within  the<br>
last 50 years) is like saying that a mouse standing on a pile of dung has a<br>
similar view as giraffe.<br>
