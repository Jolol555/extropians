Hmm. Does anyone else think that transhumanism is weakened<br>
definitionally by the use of 'seeks.' <br>
<p>
It seems to me that one could espouse a transhumanist philosophy without<br>
doing much of anything, really. Transhumanism *could* be a waiting game. <br>
<p>
Maybe something like this (?):<br>
<p>
TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life that accelerates our development<br>
beyond currently human limitations by way of science, technology,<br>
creativity, and other rational means.<br>
<p>
This requires every philosophy that might call itself transhumanist to<br>
*prove* it by pointing to the ways it accelerates development. <br>
<p>
It all depends on whether we want to tighten the standard by which<br>
transhumanist philosophies are judged. This little alteration might be<br>
enough to nip any 'rapture of the future' accusations in the bud.<br>
Transhumanism requires a person to develop now, not just later<br>
(perpetually deferred).<br>
