Humor me, if you will, with the answer to a particular philosophical<br>
problem which has been bugging me.<br>
<p>
I often hear individuals in debates about consciousness stating that they<br>
know, with absolute certainty, "above logic," as you say, that they exist<br>
and that they are conscious.  Now, while I do believe that I am conscious,<br>
and have no evidence at all to the contrary, how precisely is it that I<br>
might KNOW that I exist?  Surely, if I did not exist, I would not know it.<br>
And though I would have to exist in order to deny my own existence, even to<br>
formulate this question in my mind, how do I know that these are actually<br>
happening?  Wouldn't it be possible that I do NOT exist and that I have not<br>
formulated these questions at all?<br>
<p>
Would it be more precise to say that I am more certain that I am conscious<br>
than I am certain of anything else?  Or is there a stronger version of this<br>
proof which I am overlooking?<br>
<p>
Actually, having formulated this question and now realizing my error, I<br>
realize that I SHOULD have asked "How does a person know that they exist?"<br>
or "How do you know?"  But the points, I think, do not change.<br>
