In a message dated 98-06-24 16:47:47 EDT, you write:<br>

&lt;&lt; &gt; 1) God does not overcome evil because he has voluntarily undertaken<br>
<i> &gt; to somehow remove himself from this universe, in order to give the</i><br>
<i> &gt; beings here, say, greater responsibility.  However, since we are</i><br>
<i> &gt; here, and somehow can, we should overcome evi &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This sounds as if god has, for whatever reason, taken a "neutral" stand on the<br>
issue. Leaving it to us humans to sink or swim, so to speak.  The flaw i see<br>
in this is tha this "neutral" god allows his chosen spokespeople to tolerate<br>
evil, even to promote it and even, in some cases, to engage in it!  I'm<br>
supposed to believe in a religion whose leaders are corrupt?  A religion whose<br>
followers frequently demonstrate their displeasure with a persons flaws by<br>
killing that person?  A religion that says a person is evil or "ungodly"<br>
because of a biological difference, weather that difference be a matter of<br>
skin color, sexuality, or whatever other perceived offense?  <br>
<p>
Such ideas are repulsive to me.  If it sounds as if I have an attitude against<br>
such, that is because I do.  I can't abide the hypocrisy and hatred generated<br>
by these "Institutions of Love"  <br>
<p>
Sorry if this post seems a bit vehement.   Must be the ornery Scotsman in<br>
me..:-)<br>
<p>
Thanks all, Cori<br>
