<i>&gt; &gt;You don't need any nukes to defend yourself from suckers</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;controlled plane with a couple of rockets and machine guns? Or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;remotely controlled gunboat?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At which point, at the request of the Tongan government the US sends over</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few stealth fighters (aka small stealth bombers) with laser-guided bombs</i><br>
<i>&gt; and you don't wake the next morning. </i><br>
<p>
Why would the US bother to help some little dictator in a far away, <br>
obscure part of the world? Unless there's oil or tons of white<br>
powder to be had, no-one's interested. Besides, "stealth" is highly<br>
overrated. It can't have rain, and the planes can be made visible<br>
if you tweak your radar a bit. Then they're just billion dollar<br>
sitting ducks. Anyway they're not gonna waste their expensive bombs<br>
on some remote, insignificant little island with a bunch of nerds <br>
on it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Surely you can't honestly believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that any US president is going to sit by quietly while you set up a free</i><br>
<i>&gt; country anywhere on the planet? </i><br>
<p>
If you practice some basic discretion he (and others) won't even know<br>
about you, and even if anyone knew, what would they care? They may be<br>
great assholes, but even the US military don't blast private islands at<br>
sight. What if you have lawyers. Oh dear, what bad PR that would be if<br>
it leaked out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Either you stay within their definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "freedom" (e.g. no selling drugs, no gun-running, no bioweapons, no "child</i><br>
<i>&gt; porn", no giving haven to "terrorists") or you're going to become Global</i><br>
<i>&gt; Enemy #1. And you can't prevent those things in a free country.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't even *try* to prevent such things out of principle. There is<br>
no problem as long as your island is simply a place to live for just<br>
100 - 300 or so individuals, and business is conducted elsewhere from<br>
boats or other platforms. No-one's going to bother a remote retirement<br>
community where consenting adults (no kids in this place) take some<br>
dope or read porn every now and then. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Unlike in any regular country, you can use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;virtually any means you want to defend yourself successfully, and *not*</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be arrested afterwards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh yeah, you can use anthrax and nerve gas on passing warships and no-one</i><br>
<i>&gt; is going to take action against you. Get real.</i><br>
<p>
Gassing warships? Really, I don't think that will be necessary. The<br>
only likely problem are pirates, and even those prefer to operate<br>
close to coastlines, not on the high seas where there's no cover etc.<br>
As with regular isolated islands, hardly anyone ever comes by, or<br>
knows that they're there alltogether. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And *should* they cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;trouble after all, they're as vulnerable as anyone to retaliatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;attacks (with for example the plague, anthrax, nerve gas or something</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more subtle) by the surviving islanders/their comrades in other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. But such tactics are only possible if you already have those</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons ready to use. The only tactic which will keep the US government</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of your country is to call up the President and say "hey, we've got</i><br>
<i>&gt; nukes in various major cities which will detonate if we don't send them</i><br>
<i>&gt; a valid code every ten minutes. Attack us and they go off." Only immediate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; massive retaliation will stop them, not a vague threat of future attacks.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, once you've arrived at this point you've in fact already<br>
failed. I can almost guarantee you that the US, or any other big state,<br>
would take its chances and nuke you out of principle. No way that<br>
you could blackmail them for any significant period of time. Only<br>
massive countries like the former USSR can (could) do that, and even<br>
they came close to open conflict when they got too bold. Nukes are a<br>
quick ticket to your extinction, and too expensive and difficult<br>
to obtain anyway (if you want to get noticed, try to buy a nuke).<br>
Nerve gas or biological agents are considerably easier, but would<br>
probably also cause more trouble than they would solve. Basically,<br>
it's the pure arrogance of countries like the US that gets in the<br>
way. Obscurity is a much better weapon.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As Erwin Strauss says, don't even think about it without weapons of mass</i><br>
<i>&gt; destruction at your command, *and* the willingness to use them in defence.</i><br>
<p>
In the case of an island, I think that's a bit too extreme. Things will<br>
really get interesting when the space race begins for real. In the case<br>
of a planet, space station or asteroid, nuke defense *does* make sense.<br>
A relatively small group of pioneers could claim Mars for example, and<br>
there wouldn't be much anyone could do about it.<br>
