<p>
I'm a first born. My younger brother and I are quite different: I'm<br>
theoretical and he is quite practical, I tend to explore many areas<br>
while he focus on what needs to be learned and done. It is quite<br>
telling that I'm a computer scientist/neuroscientist and he is a civil<br>
engineer with computer specialization. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It occurred to me that I (a first born) have a high probability - on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sulloway's acount - of being narrow, conservative and opposed to change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My brother Mick, 15 years younger and the family's `baby', should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; turned out neophilic and radical - as indeed he did, in a relaxed and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sardonic way (he's a scathing authority on nuclear tropes in movies and</i><br>
<i>&gt; TV).  But I sort of muddy the picture, being gung-ho for change in some</i><br>
<i>&gt; directions and quite narrow and hostile to innovation in many others.</i><br>
<p>
I recognize the same combination of openness in some directions and<br>
closedness in others in myself.<br>
<p>
I think we humans tend to complicate our psychology on our own. We can<br>
channel our anxieties into certain schemas and deal with them in<br>
different ways. So even if you have a high basic anxiety level you<br>
might develop coping strategies focussing it in certain directions and<br>
having broad and very relaxed perspectives otherwise. Maybe this is<br>
why birth order seems to be a less strong predictor among humans than<br>
in rats.<br>
