<p>
      That's a silly response.  The Silva people say you can get 95% of <br>
      the Course's value from the paperback book by Jose Silva, 'The <br>
      Silva Mind Control Method', which describes all the coursework and <br>
      the sought-for outcomes in great detail.  If you consider my <br>
      paragraph coolly, I'm just saying that you can find out for yourself <br>
      _if_ you have psi powers.  The fact that the Silva people say you <br>
      _do_ is not my point.  If you do the course and get nothing from it, <br>
      you get a refund (OK, you're out sixty hours or so).<br>
<p>
      I did most of the Silva coursework without knowing it, in 1979, as <br>
      part of the first week-end of Werner Erhard's 'est' training (which <br>
      I'm much more critical of).  'est' is a sort of smorgasbord of all <br>
      the Californian Human Potential techniques, with all the labels <br>
      removed.  'est' is the Human Potential equivalent to bad acid, and <br>
      can do your head in, IMHO.  Read William Warren Bartley's book on <br>
      'est' for a more positive 'take.'<br>
<p>
      Here are the possibilities re: Silva Mind Control:<br>
      <br>
      You read the book, and get value from that.  The book is Extropian, <br>
      in that it asserts you have latent quasi-magical _practical_ powers <br>
      that are easily liberated.  Of course, you may decide you'd rather <br>
      not have these powers.  HHOK....<br>
      <br>
      You do the course, and get more value from that.<br>
      <br>
      You get no value from any of this, and get a refund.<br>
<p>
<p>
      As I may have mentioned, I'm working on a multi-media program to <br>
      give you all these benefits and more at your own speed.  I'm not <br>
      paid by Silva. I utilize scientific method.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; What next - plugs for $cientology?</i><br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;:-}  Funny you should say that -- I've known three Scientologists. </i><br>
      One worked on Hubbard's Sea Org flagship and is on this list; he <br>
      could be worth a dollar or two;  one is a friend who's a software <br>
      genius who makes $100 000 a year as an OS/2 wizard;, and the third <br>
      is Mary Kay's younger brother, who's also a friend, and is a <br>
      successful petrochemical industry engineer who is a Karl Popper buff <br>
      like me.<br>
<p>
       <br>
      I make my usual offer to Extropians -- I stand behind everything I <br>
      say.  Read the Silva book, and if you don't think it was well worth <br>
      the six bucks, give the book to a friend who might enjoy it and I'll <br>
      give you your six bucks back in solid gold.<br>
      <br>
      Nothing wild-eyed about that...<br>
