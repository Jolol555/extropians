Where's that list?<br>

Sure, the MIT cyborgs (including Steve Mann et al) are quite active at<br>
implementing their ideas into their everyday lives. You can get a decent<br>
intro to the Lab by checking out:<br>
&lt;<a href="http://wearables.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/">http://wearables.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/</a>&gt;<br>
<p>
The Swedish Isaac Project is also worth checking out. It's been quite<br>
successful at using many not-quite-cutting-edge-anymore-technologies to<br>
create a working solution that significantly enhances the function of<br>
non-techie humans by using wearable tech:<br>

<p>
I have many more URLs but that's a reasonable start. [My company, btw, does<br>
hw and sw development of ubiquitous computing solutions, of which<br>
"wearables" makes up a significant part.]<br>
<p>
Btw, the MIT Media Lab Wednesday Colloquium today ("The invisible computer:<br>
Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and<br>
Information Appliances Are the Solution") features Don Norman - the author<br>
of "The Design of Everyday Things," "Turn Signals Are the Facial<br>
Expressions of Automobiles" and "Things That Make Us Smart". The Colloquium<br>
is on Wednesday 1 April 4:30 pm Bartos Theatre 20 Ames Street, Cambridge<br>
(refreshments at 4:15 pm). 20 Ames is the Media Lab Bathtub, for those<br>
unfamiliar with MIT numbering schemes. Bartos is downstairs.<br>
<p>
I'll be there, taking written and voice notes on my mid-size electronic<br>
slate...<br>
<p>
tschau,<br>
