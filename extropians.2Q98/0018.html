Yes, but it could have misinterpreted, I was just trying to clarify as<br>
someone of the list, after reading your comments, sent me some private<br>
mail pointing out humanism was just atheism in disguise. <br>
<p>
Now, lets move on.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;I have met many Secular Humanists and not one of them was using it as a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;be a silly way to go about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My point was I never claimed to be speaking about secular humanism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but about secular humanists I met.  Since I qualified my statements, only</i><br>
<i>&gt; a sloppy reading would mischaraterize my assertion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I was just pointing out that your comment</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;was not a fair way to characterize humanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To reiterate:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "I've also noticed that many people who call themselves "secular</i><br>
<i>&gt;  humanist" are really just using the term as a euphemism for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "atheist.""</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was observing how people I've met who call themselves secular humanists</i><br>
<i>&gt; use the term.  I qualified my statement in such a way that only someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; with an axe to grind would have mistaken it.  I took no stand on humanISM</i><br>
<i>&gt; or secular humanISM.  I was discussing secular humanISTS.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You should try some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;scientific method which does not allow one to use such "personal" off</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the cuff observations as evidence to support claims. Have you ever heard</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the science method?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Problem is: I did not and do not claim my "off the cuff observations" are</i><br>
<i>&gt; somehow the height of data collection.  In fact, I made no claims that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; could not support.  Nor did I maintain that my experience is somehow</i><br>
<i>&gt; priviliged or universalizeable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Of course you have. Just as I can read. I was not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;jumping on your back, why did you feel it necessary to stomp on mine?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because you misread me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You just were making it sound like Secular Humanism was philosophically</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a "weak straw man" which is identical to atheism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I made and make no claim about secular humanism as a philosophy.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was making claims about secular humanists -- not ideas but people.  I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; met a few and when we got to discussing our beliefs, it seemed to me</i><br>
<i>&gt; that most had atheism as their only binding belief -- the thing they had in</i><br>
<i>&gt; common, that they all could agree on.  Some did share other things, such</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a basically JudeoChristian ethical system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not claiming that secular humanism implies this, though if secular</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanism owes anything to humanism as it has come down through</i><br>
<i>&gt; the centuries, then one might expect it to be JudeoChristian ethically</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Leftist politically.  This is because few movements have outright</i><br>
<i>&gt; rejected JudeoChristian ethics -- even Marxists are animated by them</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- and humanism is generally has always been more toward the Left</i><br>
<i>&gt; end of the political spectrum.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For the record, these are just my observations.  I've not done nor do</i><br>
<i>&gt; I claim to have done extensive research or randomly surveyed</i><br>
<i>&gt; secular humanists.  The thing to do here, if anyone cares, would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do a survey of alleged secular humanists and examine the</i><br>
<i>&gt; major and influential works of secular humanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This would not be a be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a far criticism. It is like then people characterize transhumanism as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;science fiction that is confused about reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, my claim was about secular humanISTS NOT secular humanISM.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think I have a little understanding of transhumanISM, but it would not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong to examine and post observations about transhumanISTS, as long</i><br>
<i>&gt; as others and me did not confuse the two.  Do you see the difference?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cheers!</i><br>
