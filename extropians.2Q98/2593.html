Here is a pet theory of mine.  I have not researched it, but will throw it out<br>
for comments.<br>
<p>
I think that the original superstitious or religous beliefs probably started<br>
with the hunting of animals for meat.  What if an enlightened person realized<br>
that proper planning could make the hunt go better?  This would not be<br>
intuitively obvious, and would be hard to explain to others.  How would such an<br>
individual go about training others?  Perhaps it would be explained by ritual. <br>
A person dresses up as the animal intended to be hunted.  Others are assigned<br>
specific roles, including where to hide, when to run, how to approach, how to<br>
attack, etc.  This procedure would be repeated over and over until the hunters<br>
had it memorized and could do it right.  Eventually, the enlightened one would<br>
declare that they were ready to hunt the real animal, and that the hunt would<br>
probably go well.  Based on the practice rituals, the enlightened one could<br>
predict who could hunt, and who could not hunt.  It might even be possible to<br>
predict who would probably run in front of the charging animal and be trampled,<br>
or who couldn't run fast enough to keep up, or who would probably trip while<br>
running.<br>
<p>
The enlightened person might also realize that practice would make<br>
spear-throwing aim  more accurate.  Such a person might request that an effigy<br>
animal be speared over and over from a distance, until the effigy can be<br>
"killed" often.  Only when the ritual animal can be killed in ritual would<br>
their be a good chance that the real animal would be killed in the real world.<br>
<p>
Such a person would probably be seen as magical or as having some connection<br>
with the nature gods that control the animals.  Ritual would be seen as<br>
important, becuase it often predicted the outcome.  Those who were poor in<br>
ritual, would be poor in the hunt.  Those declared victorious in ritual, would<br>
be declared victorious in the hunt.  It may even be that the enlightened one<br>
was injured through experience, or old with experience, such that they were<br>
excluded from the actual hunt.  Their contribution would be the ritual<br>
preperation before the hunt.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the war-paint or wearing of skins was also a way to better hide or<br>
disguise the smell.<br>
<p>
Can it be that the roots of religious and ritual come from a scientific basis,<br>
but that those receivers of the knowledge couldn't understand it, so they<br>
reduced it down to religious rituals and trappings?  Maybe religions and<br>
rituals are poor copies of some original method that was lost throughout the<br>
ages.  As with most religions, the followers deified and extrapolated the<br>
original teachings, based on their limited knowledge.  Eventually, such<br>
teachings were simply "magic" and obedience was simply "commanded by the gods."<br>
<p>
Any comments on this theory on the origins of religion?  I would also postulate<br>
a similar origin for agriculture rituals looking to the stars to dictate when<br>
to plant, when to harvest, etc.<br>
