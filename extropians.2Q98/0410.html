<i>&gt;seem like a naive question, but I would appreciate people's opinions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If the parachutes could be made sufficiently automatic so as to require NO<br>
user interaction, and the aircraft could be equipped with a door openable in<br>
the air (old 727's come to mind, and DC-8's?) this could become a reality.<br>
If the airlines see the same public relations benefit to this that they see<br>
in putting defibrillators on board, they might do it without governmental<br>
prodding.<br>
<p>
Some major problems occur to me - as an engineer, I always see problems with<br>
things like this, but that starts me thinking of solutions...<br>
<p>
The biggest problem I see is how do you control landing? Coming down in an<br>
urban area, on power lines, in water, etc...<br>
<p>
Personally, I wish I did have access to a 'chute when I fly. Trusting my<br>
safety to a machine of unknown maintainance history, operated by persons of<br>
whom I have no knowledge of their abilities and mindset, always makes me<br>
quite nervous..<br>
