I may have an idea on how an extropian nation could be wrangled into existence<br>
with minimal difficulty.  I see it as a political parallel of the common<br>
business practice of buying a shell corporation. In business, there are many<br>
companies which have listings on Stock Exchanges, but no longer operate any<br>
business. The easiest way for a start up company to get listed on a major stock<br>
exchange is to buy one of these shell corporations.<br>
<p>
How I would apply this to the political transaction of creating an extropian<br>
state easily is going to involve a bit of environmental science here. I was<br>
watching a program on the Discovery Channel about the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,<br>
and how it is expected to collapse some time in the near future (20-200 years)<br>
due to global warming, or some other unknown cause. When this ice sheet<br>
collapses (they say when, not if), it is expected that sea levels will rise<br>
several tens of meters, which will be enough to flood many existing island<br>
nations around the world. As many of these nations will not want to give up<br>
their national sovereignty, even though they are then no longer dry land, I<br>
expect that the UN will make some special exemption to the 'dry land' clause to<br>
preserve these nations. I also expect that at least one, if not more of these<br>
nations, will simply be abandoned by nations which cannot afford to build sea<br>
platforms. This is where we can step in, buying the country out. We could even<br>
plan ahead on this and work out an agreement with some island nations ahead of<br>
time that we would get the capital to build sea structures in return for<br>
concessions.....<br>
