<i>&gt;yup.  we may be seeing the fear that</i><br>
the five jobs<br>
<i>&gt;created are for people *other* than the</i><br>
one displaced.<br>
<i>&gt;it might be early yet for extropians to</i><br>
declare victory over<br>
<i>&gt;the problem of creating a society that</i><br>
has no need for<br>
<i>&gt;its less qualified members.  spike</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Problem? What problem? "No need" you<br>
say? I don't even want "less qualified<br>
people" around. We'd have a better<br>
world, IMNSHO, if we created a society<br>
without less qualified people<br>
altogether. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
But seriously folks, if extropianism has<br>
anything to do with "a society that has<br>
no need for<br>
its less qualified members", then Mexico<br>
must have a huge extropian head start<br>
over the US. Or do you believe that the<br>
hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens<br>
crossing the border into California,<br>
Texas, and Arizona all have advanced<br>
engineering degrees and doctorates in<br>
computer programming? I don't think so.<br>
<p>
The sooner (American) extropians<br>
"declare victory" the sooner less<br>
qualified migrants will get the message,<br>
and stop pouring into America. For every<br>
displaced worker in the (extropian) US<br>
and UK, you can count five in<br>
(anti-extropian) countries.<br>
<p>
The newsreels I've seen of<br>
quasi-capitalist China indicate that<br>
displaced workers from anywhere only<br>
need to learn Chinese to get plenty of<br>
jobs there.<br>
<p>
On second thought, I guess I rather<br>
prefer a society that has no need for<br>
its less qualified members. After all --<br>
consider the alternative, i.e., a<br>
society that *needs* its less qualified<br>
members. Such a loopy society would not<br>
last long.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
