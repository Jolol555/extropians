And the ideas man in question is Richard Josza, of the University of<br>

<p>
Ah. Well, don't worry, this is false. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The bottom line is that some clever fellow has worked out how to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;answers out of a quantum preparation *without turning the machine on to</i><br>
<i>&gt;run the calculation*.</i><br>
<p>
Someone has slightly misunderstood the process, and then jumped to a<br>
conclusion that they *thought* followed logically from the description they<br>
had seen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's based on the bomb-testing idea I'm sure you're all familiar with from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Penrose's SHADOWS OF THE MIND.  Elitzur and Vaidman showed that one time</i><br>
<i>&gt;in 4 you can determine the state of a macro-system, *without observing it*,</i><br>
<i>&gt;if &gt;it is coupled to a quantum detector.  </i><br>
<p>
Actually they also showed the result you are describing here, namely that<br>
you can determine that state as with reliability as close to 1 as you like<br>
(but not actually 1), and you can reduce the probability that that will<br>
involve measuring the system (in any one universe) to an arbitrarily low<br>
number above zero. Again, if you reduce it to zero, the scheme won't work. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All that's needed is for the observation </i><br>
<i>&gt;to be *possible* via that procedure, </i><br>
<p>
Which means "to occur in some universes", remember.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and quantum interference</i><br>
<i>&gt;can deliver you information about the real world without actually looking</i><br>
<i>&gt;at it.  Some of the time, anyway.  And since that's true, a sequence of</i><br>
<i>&gt;assays can multiply up your level of confidence to whatever degree you</i><br>
<i>&gt;wish.</i><br>
<p>
The whole quantum computation that does this is the "sequence of assays".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[...] This gadget doesn't need to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;activated until *after* it's done the job.  </i><br>
<p>
False.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(What's more, it's reported</i><br>
<i>&gt;that objects have now been `photographed' using this principle without</i><br>
<i>&gt;shining any light on them, simply because light *could have been* shone on</i><br>
<i>&gt;them....)</i><br>
<p>
No. It's because light did fall on them in other universes. Just like any<br>
other interference experiment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Penrose is evidently rubbing his hands with glee, because this sounds like</i><br>
<i>&gt;it might be the missing link in his theory that neural microtubules can</i><br>
<i>&gt;sustain quantal superpositions in something like a Bose condensate.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;brain might thus leap instantly and without frying itself to conclusions</i><br>
<i>&gt;that even the smartest Turing Jupiter brain would be agonising over to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;end of time...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I dunno.  Sounds like witchcraft to me.  Pretty logic, though.</i><br>
<p>
All that microtubule stuff, and more generally all suggestions that the<br>
brain is a quantum computer, while not witchcraft, seem entirely<br>
unmotivated to me. The 'interaction-free measurements', however (or<br>
counterfactual computations as Richard Jozsa has somewhat misleadingly<br>
called them), are a matter of ordinary, uncontroversial physics. It is<br>
indeed pretty physics. And it only sounds like witchcraft if you try to<br>
understand it as happening in a single universe.<br>
