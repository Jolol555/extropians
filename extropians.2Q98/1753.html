I'd be interested to hear (off-list if you prefer) if anyone else on this<br>
list are home educating their children or know of anyone who is.  Seems to<br>
me that this choice might be popular among this sort of crowd.<br>
<p>
I have 5 children and a nice sub-tropical lifestyle.  High-tech and<br>
tele-commuting, we've dumped public education and believe that we can do it<br>
better.  Others ?<br>
