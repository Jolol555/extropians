That claim is contradicted by the availability of specialty food in<br>
every city.  (Did you read my first sentence above?)  The majority say<br>
"no tofu!" and yet tofu is sold.  The majority say "Who needs to pay<br>
retail for water?" and gourmet bottled water is sold.  The majority say<br>
"beer is beer" and microbreweries sprout like mushrooms.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Where's the center?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The firm would be the centre, even if it is 'controlled' by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; customers.</i><br>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; Again, the firm is the centre.  Just because it has not been quite so</i><br>
<i>&gt; successful at forcing me to use its product (like a government) it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not decentralised.  And just because there are more firms than</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments, they are not decentralised.  And just because firms are</i><br>
<i>&gt; smaller than governments, they are not decentralised.</i><br>
<p>
If you cut out everything else in the world and look only at the trades<br>
of a particular actor, yes, it is naturally "centralized" - as has<br>
already been conceded at least once.  I can't see the advantage of<br>
describing a free economy, with millions of actors each trading with<br>
thousands of others who may not know of each other, in such terms.<br>
