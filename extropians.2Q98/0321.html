I'm in the process of writing 'Report #TL20: The Principles<br>
of Meta-Knowledge.'  A section of the report will be titled<br>
"Knowledge Roles."<br>
<p>
I believe this section is relevant to all those involved<br>
in improving and increasing their own knowledge as well as<br>
that of others.<br>
<p>
I would appreciate your comments and suggestions for improving<br>
my classification and descriptions:<br>
<p>
<p>
Knowledge Roles<br>
===============<br>
<p>
By "knowledge role" I distinguish between different ways<br>
in which people tend to behave with respect to knowledge.<br>
This section was considerably influenced by James Craig<br>
Green's article 'ADVOCATES, SKEPTICS and SEEKERS' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://pw2.netcom.com/~zeno7/advocates.html">http://pw2.netcom.com/~zeno7/advocates.html</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
I distinguish the following knowledge roles:<br>
<p>
1. Advocate - Someone who has found some (hopefully) *useful<br>
knowledge* (or "absolute truth") and actively attempts to<br>
spread this knowledge or "truth" because it's *useful* or<br>
"right."<br>
<p>
2. Skeptic - Someone who has found some purported "knowledge"<br>
or "truth" to be mistaken and sets about proving that it's<br>
"wrong." <br>
<p>
3. Seeker - Someone who actively seeks to improve his or<br>
her knowledge.  (A Seeker can also act as a Learner or an<br>
Unlearner, or both.)<br>
<p>
4. True Believer - Someone who believes he or she has found<br>
"objective truth" or "absolute truth."  (A True Believer<br>
could also act as an Advocate or a Skeptic.)<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
According to Dr. Michael Hewitt-Gleeson -- 'Brain Freebie' course at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.sot.com.au/">http://www.sot.com.au/</a>&gt; -- the symptom of the True Believer is saying,<br>
 "I have the truth" ... "My policy is the true policy" ... "My doctrine<br>
is good and your doctrine is evil", or, perhaps, "Wasn't I lucky to be<br>
born into that True Religion and now what are we going to do about you,<br>
unbeliever?" It's a dangerous mental condition.  In the Preface of his<br>
book 'The True Believers' Peter Bowler warns:<br>
<p>
Here they come, the True Believers, wide-eyed and earnest; here they come,<br>
the devotees, the fanatics, the evangelists, the pilgrims, the worshippers,<br>
the contemplatives -- clutching their hymns and invocations, observing their<br>
holy commandments and taboos, performing their sacrifices but, above all,<br>
believing.  Believing in God, or in several gods, or even a goddess or two.<br>
Believing in the soul, in demons, in eternal forgiveness, in eternal<br>
punishment, in life after death, in assorted varieties of heaven and hell,<br>
in the power of faith to heal, to move mountains...<br>
<p>
They are and always have been, the idealists of humankind. Seeking<br>
something beyond the material, something intangible, something to explain<br>
the unexplainable, something to assuage their fear of the uncontrollable,<br>
something to compensate them for the unacceptable, something to offer them<br>
a kind of dignity and power in the midst of indignity and impotence.<br>
<p>
Let us not mock the True Believer for their idealism. But watch out for<br>
them -- they can be dangerous. Combative people, they are, by nature;<br>
crusaders rather than compromisers. Because they are right, others are<br>
wrong. The sinful must be punished, and who more sinful than the<br>
unbeliever? The more intolerant and warlike among them seek to punish the<br>
unbeliever in this life, with holy wars and inquisitions; the more<br>
benevolent and tolerant leave it to their God to punish the unbeliever with<br>
eternal torments after death.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From time to time history has thrown up a sect that is gentle and moderate</i><br>
and peace loving, like the Quakers or the Baha'i; invariably these sects<br>
are singled out for the most ruthless persecution at the hands of the True<br>
Believers.<br>
<p>
When two religions are so similar as to be almost identical in every<br>
significant respect then take cover, because the conflict between them will<br>
be truly murderous. Buddhists and Presbyterians get along famously, but if<br>
you are selling insurance you would be ill-advised to set up shop in<br>
Palestine or Belfast."<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
5. Rejector or True Unbeliever - Someone who tends to<br>
automatically reject new, different information with<br>
little or no thought.  The extreme Rejector might<br>
claim that all knowledge is basically useless.  The<br>
"Semmelweis-reflex" applies here -- see '#TL03: HOW TO<br>
IMPROVE YOUR INFORMATION' at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl03.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl03.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
6. Onlygenius - Someone who believes he or she is the "only genius"<br>
in the universe.  L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology infamy wrote along<br>
these lines, "In all the history of Scientology there have been<br>
only two or three good ideas that were not generated by me..."<br>
I once shared some realization of mine with a Scientologist friend.<br>
He asked me, "Did Ron say that?"  I said, "No, I said it."  He<br>
replied, "Well, if Ron didn't say it, it can't be true!"  The<br>
Onlygenius suffers from the N.I.H. Syndrome ("not invented here")<br>
coupled with a strong dose of arrogance -- sometimes partly justified.<br>
(The Onlygenius acts as a True Believer regarding his or her own<br>
"absolute truth" and as a Rejector or True Unbeliever regarding the<br>
knowledge of others.)<br>
<p>
7. Lazymind - Someone who's not willing to invest any<br>
effort or thought to improve his or her knowledge.  (Both<br>
True Believers and Rejectors could also be Lazyminds.)<br>
Lazyminds passively expect knowledge to be provided to them<br>
on a platter.  For example, a Lazymind might say, "All this<br>
Freedom Technology is written for Americans; I can't use it<br>
anywhere else."<br>
<p>
8. Infogetter - Someone who actively acquires the knowledge he<br>
or she needs, adapting existing knowledge as necessary.  For<br>
examples, see David T. Freeman's website at &lt;<a href="http://www.mind-trek.com/">http://www.mind-trek.com/</a>&gt;,<br>
the "Wepin Store" at &lt;<a href="http://www.wepin.com/">http://www.wepin.com/</a>&gt;, and Bill Way's<br>
website at &lt;<a href="http://www.livefree.com/">http://www.livefree.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
9. Facilitator - Someone who has considerably developed his<br>
or her knowledge and creates and provides facilities that<br>
enable others to improve their knowledge -- without acting<br>
as a know-all Advocate who commands "absolute truth."  (A<br>
Facilitator basically acts as an Advocate, but also as a<br>
Seeker seeking to become a more effective Advocate, while<br>
remaining (to some extent) a Skeptic of his or her own<br>
knowledge.)<br>
<p>
The Facilitator's task is vastly more difficult than that<br>
of the Seeker.  Once a Seeker has discovered or developed<br>
some important knowledge people in general lack, he or she<br>
may want to share this knowledge with the rest of the world.<br>
Generally, he or she could attempt do this in the role of<br>
either Advocate or Facilitator.<br>
<p>
There are major differences between Advocate and<br>
Facilitator.  Many Advocates just plug away at pushing<br>
their line, sometimes year after year, producing little<br>
or no positive results.  They tend to focus totally on<br>
pushing their line at every opportunity.  Dr. Michael<br>
Hewitt-Gleeson is an example of a successful Facilitator<br>
-- &lt;<a href="http://www.sot.com.au/">http://www.sot.com.au/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
Successful Facilitators mostly act as Advocates,<br>
but include some additional functions:<br>
(1) They seek to learn how to identify and attract<br>
prospects for their knowledge; they need to distinguish<br>
between prospects and non-prospects.  They don't<br>
want to waste precious time on non-prospects.<br>
(2) Facilitators, while being largely Advocates,<br>
focus totally on producing worthwhile results<br>
effectively and efficiently.<br>
(3) Successful Facilitator act as Seekers on at least<br>
five levels:<br>
(a) Identifying and attracting prospects;<br>
(b) Seeking to learn how to become more<br>
efficient and effective Facilitators;<br>
(c) Seeking to better understand people in<br>
general, so as to learn to improve interaction<br>
with them;<br>
(d) Seeking to use the interaction to further<br>
improve their own knowledge;<br>
(e) Seeking to improve their ability to observe,<br>
particularly self-observation -- vitally necessary<br>
to become a better Facilitator.<br>
(4) Suceessful Facilitators always remain at least<br>
"little Skeptics" concerning their own information.<br>
<p>
10. Objectivist - Someone who believes in "objective knowledge"<br>
and "objective truth."  Many Objectivists believe in "objective<br>
morality."  Objectivists tend to act as True Believers of their<br>
very rigid "objective knowledge" and "objective morality."<br>
Objectivists tend to act as Seekers of "final answers" who<br>
become Advocates of the "final answers" once they think they've<br>
found them.<br>
<p>
11. Positivist, Empiricist, or Realist - Someone who believes<br>
that all knowledge needs to be based on physical observation<br>
and experimentation; that physical objects exist independently<br>
of the mind; that certain concepts like "mind" (as opposed to<br>
brain), "self," and "consciousness" are illusions with no basis<br>
in reality.<br>
<p>
12. Subjectivist or Idealist - Someone who believes that<br>
consciousness is senior to physical reality; that subjective<br>
experience and feeling are superior to physical observation.<br>
Plato's notion of "essence" or "ideal form" constitutes the<br>
essence of subjectivism.  (Subjectivists may say, "It's all<br>
in the mind" -- but when the bus bears down at them, they<br>
mostly get quickly out of the way (like Realists) to avoid<br>
being run over and killed!)<br>
<p>
13. Egoist -- Someone who regards the self as supreme and<br>
structures his or her knowledge to best serve himself or<br>
herself.<br>
<p>
14. Solipsist - Someone who believes that only the self exists,<br>
and that all he or she can know are creations or modifications<br>
of his or her self.<br>
<p>
15. Questioneer - Someone with the ability or willingness<br>
to question everything.  Someone who repeatedly asks certain<br>
questions like, "How can I improve this?" and "What is right<br>
about what I'm doing?"  For more details on some powerful<br>
questions on the basis of which to live your life, see Kurt<br>
Wright's 'Breaking the Rules' at &lt;<a href="http://www.cpmpublishing.com/">http://www.cpmpublishing.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
16. Learner - A Seeker who has identified an area where he<br>
or she needs to learn more -- an area of relatave ignorance<br>
-- and actively learns whatever he or she needs to learn.<br>
(A Learner could act as a True Believer who "learns" only<br>
what his or her "master guru" Advocate tells him or her to<br>
"learn.")<br>
<p>
17. Unlearner - A Seeker (or "Self-Skeptic") who has identified<br>
an area where he or she needs to unlearn certain things --<br>
could be an area of "absolute truth" or arrogance -- and<br>
actively unlearns whatever he or she needs to unlearn.<br>
Because of the "truth" virus, arrogance, learning investment,<br>
etc., it's sometimes more difficult to unlearn what you've<br>
previously learned. Toward the end of 'Report #TL07G: NSPIC<br>
DEBATE #3' at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm</a>&gt;<br>
there's a debate on unlearning.  For more on unlearning,<br>
see 'Unlearning Ineffective or Obsolete Technologies' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~wstarbuc/unlearn.html">http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~wstarbuc/unlearn.html</a>&gt;.  See also<br>
'What is Unlearning?' at &lt;<a href="http://www.mithya.com/what_Unlearning.html">http://www.mithya.com/what_Unlearning.html</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
18. Identifier - Someone who in his or her mentation<br>
fails to make a distinction between word and thing (map<br>
and territory or menu and meal) when the distinction is<br>
necessary.  See '#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
During a debate I wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A thought process that will help some to recognize and</i><br>
<i>&gt;clear pemes from their minds is to make a distinction</i><br>
<i>&gt;between the *word* and the *reality* (or non-reality)</i><br>
<i>&gt;the word is usually used to represent.  Next focus</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the word and all the ways it's habitually used</i><br>
<i>&gt;by political "masters."  Then consider the likely</i><br>
<i>&gt;consequences typically produced in the minds of most</i><br>
<i>&gt;"subjects" by such use of the word.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
(Peme = political meme -- see '#TL074: Peme-Theory -<br>
Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl074.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl074.htm</a>&gt;.)<br>
<p>
Someone in the Identifier role doesn't distinguish<br>
between the *word* on the one hand, and the *reality/<br>
non-reality* on the other hand, the word is used to<br>
represent.  Thus some or all of what I'm writing here<br>
about the Identifier may make no sense to an Identifier.<br>
<p>
Toward the end of 'Report #TL07G: NSPIC DEBATE #3' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm</a>&gt; there's a<br>
discussion about "meta-literacy" -- the thinking skill<br>
necessary to break out of the Identifier role and act<br>
as a Distinctor.<br>
<p>
19. Distinctor - Someone who can competently distinguish<br>
in his or her mentation between *word* and *thing*.<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
Toward the end of 'Report #TL07G: NSPIC DEBATE #3' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm</a>&gt; I also distinguish<br>
four levels of literacy:<br>
<p>
(0) No command of language -- can't speak, read, nor write.<br>
<p>
(1) Illiterate -- can speak, but not read nor write.<br>
<p>
(2) Literate -- can speak, read, and write with a reasonable<br>
degree of proficiency.<br>
<p>
(3) Meta-literate -- can transcend language and use language<br>
to examine, analyze, and evaluate language; can change language<br>
depending on appropriateness for any given situation. <br>
<p>
...Ayn Rand's analysis of the concept/word "selfishness" is a<br>
level 3 activity.<br>
<p>
This is a level 2 statement: Government exists.<br>
<p>
Level 3: The notion that "government" (so-called) exists is silly.<br>
<p>
The person stuck at level 2 [the Identifier] can't read a level 3<br>
statement as it's written. So he compulsively distorts it into a<br>
level 2 statement: Government doesn't exist.<br>
<p>
...Level 2 statements are essentially about physical reality or<br>
have the form and syntax of statements about physical reality.<br>
<p>
Level 3 statements are essentially about verbal reality, the<br>
relationships between verbal reality and physical reality, the<br>
weaknesses, strengths, and consequences of verbal forms, and the<br>
improvement of verbal forms. Level 3 statements are about the<br>
effects words have on the way we perceive the world, the way we<br>
think about the world, the way we communicate, and the way we<br>
act. All these can be greatly influenced by the words we use."<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
The Distinctor handles level 3 statements competently and<br>
understands them easily.  The Identifier may have great difficulty<br>
with level 3 statements and generally attmepts to change and distort<br>
them into level 2 statements.<br>
<p>
20. Wordblinder - Someone who is effectively unaware of the<br>
verbal environment in which he or she lives, and relatively<br>
blind to the influences of words on perception, thinking,<br>
and behavior.  In '#TL076: TWILIGHT OF THE PHOBOCRATS' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl076.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl076.htm</a>&gt; there's a section<br>
on a Wordblinder who claims, "Words don't hurt people, people<br>
hurt people."  (A Wordblinder almost certainly also acts as an<br>
Identifier.)<br>
<p>
21. Whobeliever - ("Who-do-you-believer") Someone who thinks<br>
that some or much of your knowledge depends on "who you believe."<br>
(A Whobeliever probably tends to act as a Subjectivist or<br>
Idealist.)<br>
<p>
22. Weigher - ("Rational-weigher-of-theory-and-evidence")<br>
Someone with the ability to collect evidence and theories,<br>
or formulate theories based on the evidence, and who then<br>
reaches reasonably rational conclusions.<br>
<p>
Many years ago I had a discussion with a friend who was also<br>
a health enthusiast.  I told him that I'd decided to give up<br>
cow's milk and other dairy products.  He replied that he didn't<br>
know who to believe because some people were pro-milk and others<br>
anti-milk.  I realized that he didn't have a methodology for<br>
weighing evidence and theories in order to come to a reasonably<br>
rational conclusion.  He was acting as a Whobeliever.<br>
<p>
In contrast, I collected considerable evidence and evaluated<br>
theories related to aspects such as mucus formation, composition<br>
of cow's milk vs. composition of human milk, calcium deposits<br>
resulting in arthritis, optimum weaning age, etc.  Based on all<br>
this I reached what I believe to be a reasonably rational conclusion.<br>
I acted as a Weigher.  (A Weigher probably tends to act as a<br>
Positivist, Empiricist, or Realist.)<br>
<p>
23. Outmeaner - Someone who thinks meanings are outside himself<br>
or herself, e.g., "words have meanings."  See '#TL50A: Semantic<br>
Rigidity, Flexibility, and Freedom' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl50a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl50a.htm</a>&gt; and<br>
'#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
24. Inmeaner - Someone who believes that he or she creates and<br>
has all meanings, e.g., "people have meanings for words."  See<br>
'#TL50A: Semantic Rigidity, Flexibility, and Freedom' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl50a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl50a.htm</a>&gt; and<br>
'#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak' at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
25. Inevaluator - ("Intensional Evaluator") Someone who creates<br>
mental models or representations based on personal internal<br>
experiences, rather than external facts.  See '#TL07A: The<br>
Anatomy of Slavespeak' at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
The Inevaluator tends to elevate words over facts -- he or she<br>
tends to regard words as more important than facts.  For example,<br>
a Godbeliever as Inevaluator might say, "I can't demonstrate any<br>
observable facts that indicate God exists, but I've had many<br>
religious experiences that have convinced me that God exists."<br>
(Inevaluators also tend to act as Subjectivists or Idealists.)<br>
<p>
26. Exevaluator - ("Extensional Evaluator") Someone who creates<br>
mental models or representations based on observable external<br>
facts, rather than personal internal experiences.  See '#TL07A: The<br>
Anatomy of Slavespeak' at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
The Exevaluator tends to elevate facts over words -- he or she<br>
tends to regard facts as more important than words.  For example,<br>
in thinking about so-called "AIDS," he might say, "OK, we have<br>
this word "AIDS."  What facts are available to justify people<br>
using this word the way they habitually do?" -- See section<br>
below on ""AIDS": The Billion Dollar Word."  (Exevaluators tend<br>
to act as Positivists, Empiricists, or Realists.) <br>
<p>
27. Fixer - Someone who's attitude toward knowledge (and life in<br>
general) is: "Find out what's wrong and fix it."<br>
<p>
28. Builder - Someone who's attitude toward knowledge (and life<br>
in general) is: "Find out what's right and build on it."  For more<br>
details on the benefits to the Builder, see Kurt Wright's 'Breaking<br>
the Rules' at &lt;<a href="http://www.cpmpublishing.com/">http://www.cpmpublishing.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
