There's no question that "nanotech when?" is the Big Question:<br>

<p>
Yes, I am.<br>
  <br>

<i>&gt; over half</i><br>

<i>&gt;  most of the rest reflects operating and materials costs.</i><br>
<p>
In theory, this is true, but see below.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  IMO a similar approach can build any simple diamondoid macro-scale part, </i><br>
<i>&gt; such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  window panes, bricks, pre-cut building lumber, many machine parts, etc.</i><br>
<p>
I absolutely agree, and think that many, many macro-scale components will be<br>
fabricated at the molecular level sometime between 2005 - 2025.<br>
  <br>
If by "advanced <br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you mean the abiltity to make things other than diamondoid, such as</i><br>
potatoes,<br>
<i>&gt;  then</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I agree, we need something qualitatively advanced from the "robot factory" </i><br>
<i>&gt; model.</i><br>
<p>
Right, and herein lies my doubts about development of an "anything box" before<br>
2015, at least.  I believe it was Robin Hanson who best expressed my<br>
reservations: We know it takes the information processing capacity of either<br>
(1) a large segment of the economy or (2) a very complex living organism to<br>
generate just about any complex device right now.  Any device that could<br>
generate a complex device from inputs of only atoms and information would have<br>
to be equally complex and coordinated.  Creation and control of such an<br>
"anything box" doesn't seem to be any simpler than modeling an entire economy<br>
or organism at a highly detailed level.  I believe this problem is solvable,<br>
but is very, very difficult.  It seems to me that it will be some time before<br>
a device under the ultimate control of a single individual -- even a highly<br>
augmented one -- can be created.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  However, the IMO the robot factory generating diamondoid parts is easily </i><br>
<i>&gt; achievable in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the 2005-2015 timeframe. This technoligy is sufficient to completely </i><br>
<i>&gt; obsolete all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  current capital equipment. </i><br>
<p>
Not overnight, I think.  The process will be "bottom up" in the sense that<br>
simple component manufacture will fairly quickly succumb to "STMs-on-a-<br>
superchip" manufacturing technology, but much secondary processing and<br>
infrastructure handling will then be transformed more slowly (albeit in a<br>
matter of a decade, IMO).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If the groundwork in AI based on massively </i><br>
<i>&gt; parallel computing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is in place when the assember is developed, then the assembler-built </i><br>
<i>&gt; superconputers will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  also precipitate the singularity.</i><br>
<p>
Again, I think this presupposes a much, much higher degree of modeling and<br>
control of complex systems than we have yet achieved.  Accordingly, I see a<br>
"great leap forward" in hardware that jumps a good deal ahead of "software"<br>
for perhaps a decade.<br>
