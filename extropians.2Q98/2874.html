I'd reccomend John Stuart Mill's _Utilitarianism_ and _On Liberty_.  Then<br>
I'd especially reccomend Chapters 41-43 of David Friedman's _Machinery of<br>
Freedom_. All of these are already online at:<br>
<p>
Utilitarianism:<br>
<a href="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/122/3">gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/122/3</a><br>
On Liberty:<br>
<a href="ftp://wiretap.area.com/Library/Classic/liberty.jsm">ftp://wiretap.area.com/Library/Classic/liberty.jsm</a><br>
Machinery of Freedom:<br>

These don't relate explicitly to immortality, however, but IMO immortality<br>
isn't particularly a special case: dying is always bad for our well-being,<br>
no matter how old we become.<br>
<p>
Also, as I seem to recall, this debate arose from asking ethical questions<br>
about Alife; since I am a utilitarian I must first ascertain how and to<br>
what extent an Alife-form is or isn't made better off before I can begin<br>
to answer questions about dealing with it ethically.  Unfortunately, since<br>
there isn't really a convenient example of Alife that we can point to and<br>
say "This Alife-form is better/worse off," it seems to me impossible to<br>
determine how or even *if* it could be made better or worse off. <br>
Therefore, if you believe that consequentialism is true, then we must<br>
concede that we have no basis upon which we could even begin to answer<br>
ethical questions about Alife. <br>
<p>
Oh! of course, how silly of me to forget.  The primary argument which is<br>
often levelled against me when I speak out in favor of immortality is<br>
population growth; I definitely want to reccomend Julian Simon's _The<br>
Ultimate Resource 2_, which puts these arguments to shame.  It's also<br>
online at:<br>
<p>

Sorry if that wraps on you...  Try pasting it into your browser in parts<br>
or just typing it out by hand.<br>
<p>
Have fun!<br>
