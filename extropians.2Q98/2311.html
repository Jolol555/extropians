In Response to John Clark, Mike Lorrey and others:<br>
<p>
A lot of the points you raise miss the point, because of some <br>
common misunderstandings.  I propose to essay a clarification!<br>
<p>
<p>
 Classical Mechanics is essentially Euclid's geometry with the addition of <br>
 mass-points and vector forces (forces having direction and magnitude).<br>
<p>
<p>
 Newton's Three Laws of Motion are its foundation.<br>
<p>
<p>
 Newton added his (confusing) theory of gravitation to create Newtonian <br>
 physics.  Confusing, because Newton treats gravitation as acting <br>
 instantaneously at a distance, even while denying this!  He had to deny <br>
 it, because action-at-a-distance was 'occult' and proposing it would have <br>
 put his life at risk.<br>
<p>
<p>
 His 'corpuscular' theory of light, and his ideas on electricity and <br>
 magnetism, were never fully included into the Newtonian programme.<br>
<p>
 In the early 1800s, 'aether' theories of both light and electromagnetism <br>
 gained the ascendancy.  The aether fills all of space: light is waves in <br>
 the aether; and electric and magnetic forces are transmitted via the <br>
 aether.<br>
<p>
 Electrodynamics divided, into the English programs of Faraday (fields of <br>
 force) and Maxwell (aether force-transmission); and the Continental <br>
 programs of Weber, Helmholtz etc., in which electric and magnetic forces <br>
 are Newtonian instantaneous action-at-a-distance forces, or delayed <br>
 action-at-a-distance forces.<br>
<p>
 By the end of the 19th Century, Maxwell's unified theory of light and <br>
 electromagnetism, with an aether, had won out, consigning Faraday's field <br>
 theory to history (for a while); and consigning particle theories of <br>
 light to history (for a while).<br>
<p>
 Maxwell's theory does conform fully with Classical Mechanics.<br>
<p>
<p>
 Thus we had arrived at 'Classical Physics' -- Newtonian Mechanics plus <br>
 Maxwell's electromagnetics.  Physics seemed 'complete.'  Two niggling <br>
 problem-situations remained: the lack of evidence for the aether itself; <br>
 and problems with the wave theory of light (black-body radiation; the <br>
 'ultraviolet catastrohe'; photoelectric effects; etc).<br>
<p>
<p>
   I am _not_ proposing a return to 'Classical Physics.'<br>
<p>
   I _am_ proposing a return to a 'particles, forces, empty space' <br>
   metaphysics.<br>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
 <br>
   I propose that we return to the point where aether theories gained the <br>
   ascendancy, and *instead* we take a different tack.  We continue with <br>
   the ballistic or 'particle' or 'quantum' theory of light -- we now know <br>
   that particle theories of light can predict, describe and explain all <br>
   optical phenomena: and we retain and integrate Faraday's fields of <br>
   force to include gravitation, electricity and magnetism.  It is <br>
   possible to do this in full compliance with Classical Mechanics and in <br>
   conformance with the physical electrical and magnetic evidence, as was <br>
   shown by Leigh Page, Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale [1912] <br>
   and [1913].<br>
<p>
   Using this theoretical system, we then 'walk back the cat' as the <br>
   counterspies say, and re-examine each 'crucial experiment' in the light <br>
   of present experimental knowledge.  Lo and behold, all the 'evidence' <br>
   for Special and General Relativity dissolves: Quantum Mechanics becomes <br>
   just a useful approximation method (without any mistaken reification of <br>
   its terms); and Quantum Electrodynamics becomes unnecessary.<br>
<p>
   In result, we have a simplified, self-consistent and fully integrated <br>
   Physics, ready to advance into the territory presently occupied by <br>
   Quantum Chromodynamics.<br>
