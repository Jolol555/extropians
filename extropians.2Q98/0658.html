I don't claim that dogs are completely different, but rather sufficiently<br>
different that we should not respect "animal rights."  And by this I don't<br>
mean that we shouldn't take care of animals, love them, respect their<br>
space, etc., but rather that we should only do so when we gain utility from<br>
it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not true, if it were animals would be in no need of a brain. Most animals </i><br>

<i>&gt;decade to decade, as great as the change in musical styles from Classical to </i><br>
<i>&gt;Swing to Jazz to Rock.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with much of this, and retract my point about animals following a<br>
social code.  However, it is still worth noting that many animals often do<br>
not respect the rights of other animals or humans, and that it would be<br>
practically impossible to teach them to do so, barring some intelligence<br>
enhancing technology which, to the best of my knowledge, we do not wield.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not so. It would be in the self interest of a bitch to kill her puppies, yet </i><br>
<i>&gt;she does not do so.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.  A rational bitch will nurture her puppies if she gains a lot<br>
of utility from it, as I believe she does; this is not contrary to her<br>
self-interest.  And while I also believe that dogs would benefit greatly<br>
from agreeing to respect the rights of humans, I don't think that dogs are<br>
capable of making that kind of agreement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;I will stand by this point until you can find me an animal which</i><br>
       <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;understands and respects property rights. (Not urinating indoors</i><br>
       <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;does not count.)  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why not, seems an important point to me.</i><br>
<p>
You're right.  I should have said that not urinating indoors is<br>
INSUFFICIENT; that urinating outside is not sufficient to show an<br>
understanding or a respect of property rights.  I grant that it is a step<br>
in the right direction, but nowhere near the point where I could reasonably<br>
say that dogs respect human rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've also noticed that when I walk my dogs on my (our) property and they</i><br>
meet <br>
<i>&gt;a strange dog they're usually aggressive and the other dog submissive, but </i><br>
<i>&gt;when we're far from my home the situation is reversed.</i><br>
<p>
This is true.  Dogs do have a sense of territory.  However, this is again<br>
not sufficient to show an understanding of property rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;I would not find it at all acceptable if you killed another</i><br>
human,         <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;even if you ate them afterwards. (In  fact, especially not in</i><br>
that         <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;case.)  So why exactly should we grant animals the same license?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We don't. Sometimes humans engage in cannibalism but it's rare, the same is </i><br>
<i>&gt;true of all mammals.                               </i><br>
<p>
Actually, it was not the cannibalism which I was reacting to, but rather<br>
the implicit assertion that some animals are justified in their killing,<br>
because they "only kill others for food and self defense," (Russakoff) and<br>
that there is or should be a system of universal rights for all living<br>
things.  If we accept this, then we conclude that killing is morally<br>
acceptable if we eat our kill.  Since this moral theory results in an<br>
absurd conclusion, I reject the argument.<br>
<p>
My point is this:  if animals will not respect the "right" of other animals<br>
not to be killed and eaten, then we have nothing to gain and much to lose<br>
from respecting this special right of animals not to be killed and/or eaten<br>
by people.  In light of this, it does not make sense from a utilitarian<br>
perspective to respect animal rights.  In contrast, it does make sense for<br>
humans to respect human rights, because (if done under voluntary contract)<br>
it ensures that others will respect ones own rights.<br>
