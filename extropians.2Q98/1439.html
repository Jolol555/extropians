Johnny's Little Red Fire Engine<br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
<p>
A man was walking on the sidewalk and noticed up ahead that little<br>
Johnny was wearing a red fire man's hat and sitting in a red wagon. It<br>
appeared that the wagon was being pulled slowly by a large Labrador<br>
Retriever.<br>
<p>
When he got closer to the lad, he noticed that Johnny had a rope<br>
tied around the dog's testicles, which probably accounted for why the<br>
dog was walking so gingerly.  <br>
<p>
Smiling, he spoke to the little boy, "That's really a nice fire<br>
engine you have there son, but I'll bet the dog would pull you faster<br>
if you tied that rope around his neck." <br>
<p>
"Yeah," Johnny replied, "but then I wouldn't have a siren."<br>

A couple of weeks after hearing a sermon on "Knowing my own Hidden<br>
Secrets" and "Lies and Deceit," a man wrote the following letter to<br>
the IRS: <br>
<p>
"I have been unable to sleep knowing that I have cheated on my Income<br>
Taxes. I understated my taxable income, and have enclosed a check for<br>
$150.00. If I still can't sleep, I will send the rest." <br>

Sleeping Arrangements<br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
<p>
A lawyer and two friends, a Rabbi and a Hindu holy man, had car<br>
trouble in the countryside and asked to spend the night with a<br>
farmer.<br>
<p>
The farmer said "There might be a problem; you see, I only have room<br>
for two to sleep, so one of you must sleep in the barn." <br>
<p>
"No problem," chimed the Rabbi, "My people wandered in the desert for<br>
forty years, I am humble enough to sleep in the barn for an evening.<br>
With that he departed to the barn and the others bedded down for the<br>
night.<br>
<p>
Moments later a knock was heard at the door; the farmer opened the<br>
door, there stood the Rabbi from the barn. <br>
<p>
"What's wrong?" asked the farmer. <br>
<p>
He replied, "I am grateful to you , but I can't sleep in the barn.<br>
There is a pig in the barn and my faith believes that is an unclean<br>
animal."<br>
<p>
His Hindu friend agrees to swap places with him. But a few minutes<br>
late the same scene reoccurs. There is a knock on the door, <br>
<p>
"What's wrong, now?" the farmer asks. <br>
<p>
The Hindu holy man replies, "I too am grateful for your helping us out<br>
but there is a cow in the barn and in my country cows are considered<br>
sacred. I can't sleep on holy ground!"<br>
<p>
Well, that leaves only the lawyer to make the change. He grumbled and<br>
complained, but went out to the barn.<br>
<p>
Yep, you guessed it! Moments later there was another knock on the<br>
farmers door. Frustrated and tired, the farmer opens the door, and<br>
there stood the pig and the cow.<br>

The "Teaching What I Most Need to Know" Section:<br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
<p>
To know full and pure love is a matter of rising to your highest <br>
self, being willing to accept the other fully and with an <br>
understanding heart.  There must be complete and full trust between <br>
you and the other, which also serves to clear away your and the <br>
other's issues, making it possible for you both to approach the world <br>
with clear eyes and joyful optimistic hearts.<br>
<p>
Take care in who you trust for a romantic relationship by listening <br>
to your feelings, but when you find that right person who you know <br>
you can trust, give it your all and then some more.  You will find <br>
sides of your self that you hadn't even imagined, blooming freely in <br>
the light of love.  And remember always - a relationship is not a <br>
thing from which you need gain, but rather, a joining to which you <br>
give and thereby fully know who you are.<br>
<p>
The risks are so worth the incredible feeling of having an <br>
undying bond and trust with the one you love.  Your expanding <br>
fullness will come from giving to and boosting up another to untold <br>
dimension, as the other will give to you.  Love expands and heals.  <br>
Let not fear enter your heart in life or love.  Cast it out until <br>
only feelings based in love remain.  Do this by facing your feelings <br>
honestly, knowing them, and sharing them.<br>
<p>
This giving and building includes letting that person grow and go<br>
should that be what they need.  Be true to them always in all ways.  <br>
But be true to yourself first and foremost, thereby being true to <br>
the other.  <br>
<p>
Should your relationship not be able to carry forward for all the<br>
time you live, remember that success in a relationship is not based<br>
on its length.  Success in relationships, and all other things, is<br>
based on the fullness of your soul.<br>
