I confess, I am a fan of the X-files.  I find the show fun.<br>
<p>
What is amusing to me is that the X-files is currently espousing the world-view<br>
that you describe above.  Fox Mulder has evolved to the point that he no longer<br>
believes in UFOs.  He believes that the whole concept is a fraudulent attempt<br>
by big government to numb the masses into accepting coming future events.  They<br>
use the rediculous cover-story of UFOs to conceal a more sinister and<br>
down-to-earth scientific experiments and military exercises.  In the X-Files<br>
universe, the government discredits witnesses to secret operations by fooling<br>
them into think what they have witnessed was a UFO.  That way, no one<br>
investigates the real events that are occurring, because they are too busy<br>
investigating the bizarre cover stories.<br>
<p>
The best thing about the show is that the main character can reject years of<br>
past belief when new scientific evidence shows him to be in error.  I hope they<br>
can maintain this integrety, and don't "rescue" Mulder from "losing the faith".<br>
<p>
My favorite episode was the one with Charlse Nelson Riley writing a book about<br>
a UFO abduction.  The different witnesses gave him radically different versions<br>
of the story, showing that everybody remembers things the way they want to, and<br>
that eyewitness reports are unreliable.  Mulder wanted to believe in the UFO,<br>
while one of the witnesses describes Mulder as the evil government man-in-black<br>
trying to supress the information.  Scully does an alien autopsy on the alien<br>
to prove it is real and discovers that the alien is a human in a rubber suit<br>
who was killed during the staged event.  After reporting that the alien was<br>
faked, a film of her autopsy shows up on Fox carefully doctored to make it look<br>
like a real alien autopsy.  The best part was when a girl was put under<br>
hypnosis to bring about more UFO memories.  The scene in the hypnotists' office<br>
with all the investigators transformed into the scene in the UFO with aliens<br>
examining her.  It was clear to the audience that the "memories" were being<br>
manufactured from the current hypnosis session, even though the characters on<br>
the screen did not realize that the memories were being manufactured!<br>
<p>
I find the show to be very extropian, and very true to life.  There is<br>
confilicting information in the show.  True-believers think that the aliens are<br>
confirmed to exist, while skeptics can show where all the evidence has been<br>
faked.  Even the main characters flip-flop between believing and disbelieving. <br>
They find "proof" that convinces them, and then find "proof" that the original<br>
proof was faked.  Even if everything in the X-files were literally true, I<br>
still would not believe in aliens while a true believer would think that the<br>
existance of aliens was indisputeable.  I don't know how much more realistic<br>
they could get.<br>
