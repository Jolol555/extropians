<i>&gt; From: Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net (none)&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think the impression left in the mind of most English-speakers</i><br>
<i>&gt; when they hear someone describe eirself as an "agnostic" is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this person merely is unconcerned with religion; ey does not go to</i><br>
<i>&gt; church, baptize children, etc.  But the label "agnostic" does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; imply any disrespect for others' religious beliefs--if I hear</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone call emself "agnostic", I would expect em to have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualms about having close friends and associates who are dedicated</i><br>
<i>&gt; theists, maybe even marry one, or support eir child's choice to</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe, or even have some measure of respect for clergy.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When someone calls emself "atheist", I expect that such person</i><br>
<i>&gt; might actually distrust openly theist folks, to entirely discount</i><br>
<i>&gt; the opinions of clergy and even ridicule them, to actively oppose</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious-based laws and practices, to oppose prayer and teaching</i><br>
<i>&gt; creationist nonsense in schools, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is for this reason that I call myself "atheist" even though</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tom's more logical definition might not apply.  I want there to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be no doubt in anyone's mind that even though I may rationally</i><br>
<i>&gt; refuse to assert that there is positively no God, I nonetheless</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to make it clear that I think those who assert that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a God have lost my respect, and decisions of any kind made</i><br>
<i>&gt; from theist doctrine are bad decisions, not merely different.</i><br>
<p>
And AMEN to that! Regardless of any intellectual games or "official"<br>
definitions this is the real difference between atheism and agnosticism.<br>
Atheists *reject* the god-meme out of principle, they think it's wrong<br>
and should be fought (mostly verbally) whenever possible. It's a stupid,<br>
dangerous (killer!) meme that has caused enormous damage throughout<br>
history, and it deserves every ounce of criticism it gets.<br>
<p>
Agnostics on the other hand seem to have something of a lukewarm<br>
attitude towards the whole matter. It seems that they refuse to see<br>
religion for what it really is: dangerous and stupid, not "neutral".<br>
Just go to Iran or the Bible Belt and see how "harmless" it is. Mass<br>
insanity really is quite scary.<br>
