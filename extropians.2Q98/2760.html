Okay.  There is still a slight issue in that addressing is a major<br>
overhead in storage architecture, and involves dynamics; the same caveats <br>
about the need for error correction apply.  You also better make sure <br>
that your nanomechanical storage is extremely error free.  What happens <br>
if thermal fluctuations flip your bit?  Sure, this would be a rare event -- <br>
but you're talking about a scenario where the goal is ~ 10^10 bits or more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Three-dimensional</i><br>

<i>&gt; technology,</i><br>
<p>
Well, it would need to be. Suppose (conservatively), that you are going <br>
to have 10^6 layers, each storing bits with a density of 100 atoms / bit; <br>
a storage density of 1 bit for every few nanometers squared.  Such a <br>
device will have roughly 10^12 more bits stored on it than current <br>
commerical chips.  I forget the exact numbers, but the dissipation rate <br>
per logical operation is something like 10^6 kT in current chips.  That <br>
means you have a major problem unless everything is done completely <br>
dissipation free.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and diamondoid should be able to operate at much higher</i><br>

<i>&gt; of heat than silicon, also.</i><br>
<p>
These are good points, but they only buy you a tiny amount.<br>
