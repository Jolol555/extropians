Good point. I negelected the cavity effect of the fuselage. Still, I would<br>
design this equipment to work in a test chamber with at least 10 times the<br>
worst case expected RF fields applied. Just stands to reason - it's mission<br>
critical stuff..<br>
<p>
That must be why magnets are considered 'hazardous' on aircraft..<br>
