Sorry to jump in the middle of your thread guys, but you got me thinking<br>
about a particular example.<br>
<p>
-----Original Message-----<br>
From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;There are many ways to doctor information to ensure that it can be</i><br>
identified as a copy.<br>
<i>&gt;For example, in my work, I deal with mail list brokers. We do mailstream</i><br>
processing for<br>
<i>&gt;their customers. The broker will send us a tape or disk with file(s) that</i><br>
the customer<br>
<i>&gt;rents from the broker for a single or more use. The customer then does his</i><br>
or her mail<br>
<i>&gt;campaign with the rented list. The doctoring comes in in that the list is</i><br>
seeded with<br>
<i>&gt;dummy name records which are set up by the broker.</i><br>
<p>
The problem of course on the internet with this method is knowing *who* the<br>
client is that has pirated your list.<br>
<p>
For my example I will use a software purchase over the internet.  In it's<br>
simplest form;<br>
1) The customers requests and pays for the software<br>
2) The software is "watermarked" in some way to identify who it was sold to<br>
3) The customer downloads this package, and if any pirate copies turn up<br>
then we've got him.<br>
<p>
The problem here is of course that there is currently no way of providing<br>
this sort of identity matching.  Short of smartcard implants at birth or DNA<br>
authenticators on PC's, there may never be an effective way of doing this.<br>
<p>
If you use my credit card number to watermark the file, it does you no good<br>
to track me down because even though it was a *valid* credit card, I had<br>
circumvented the bank's identification policy and got it in a false name.<br>
You won't catch me because you don't know who to chase after.<br>
<p>
In fact any "digital signature" is only as strong as it's policy for being<br>
issued by the authority who makes it.<br>
<p>
I'm interested in any pointers to discussions about how the information<br>
economy will operate given the above conditions.  In my opinion this is a<br>
fundamentally different problem than has previously been addressed by any<br>
economic model.  How does Tim May's "Crypto-Anarchic Manifesto" translate to<br>
real life and real economic activity ?<br>
<p>
Keep the thread going, it's an interesting discussion.  Better than A=!A<br>
etc..  Ignore this detour if it isn't central to your point - I just wanted<br>
to have expand on it a bit.<br>
