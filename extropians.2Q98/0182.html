Hal Finney wrote 4/8/98: &lt;Suppose technology evolves to the point where<br>
people can create new biological entities in the privacy of their homes.&gt;<br>
<p>
Um... We've been here for some time now, Hal.  The biological entities are<br>
called children.  With the socialist statism we live under, the privacy of<br>
our homes isn't very private any more.  It seems the state has largely<br>
coopted raising our children, at least those children not murdered by their<br>
mothers with the sanction of our judicial oligarchy.<br>
<p>
Hal: &lt;Biotechnology allows you to grow an organism with a desired genetic<br>
code in an artificial womb.  You can create people in this way, and modify<br>
their genome any way you like.&gt;<br>
<p>
We're not here yet, but we're certainly trying to get here.  Following my<br>
distinction between "developed" individuals (which many abortion<br>
enthusiasts pretend to find at some arbitrary point before or even after<br>
birth but which actually don't ever exist) and "developing" individuals<br>
(which begin to develop after conception and continue until death - with<br>
polycentric jurisdictions free to handle different options), then the only<br>
area here subject to political jurisdiction would be if the genome were<br>
intentionally altered during development.  That would be altering a self<br>
other than your own self, which involves the larger polity.  The polity may<br>
choose to ignore the alterations, set guidelines for them, outlaw them,<br>
whatever they see fit.  Choose a different polity if you don't like it. <br>
But let's not have one giant standard for all, a monoculture.<br>
<p>
Hal: &lt;It seems to me that intentionally creating a being whose life will<br>
involve more suffering than pleasure is wrong.  The degree of wrongness<br>
would relate to how much suffering there was, and the level of<br>
consciousness and intelligence which perceived the suffering.&gt;<br>
<p>
Half the world's population believes in some form of redemptive qualities<br>
in suffering.  Suffering or pleasure are very weak guides to morality.  Why<br>
would suffering or pleasure matter much at all, especially since such<br>
physiological reactions are increasingly modulated by technological means? <br>
They just don't mean much in the moral sphere because humans (and<br>
transhumans) are able to transcend both, whether aiming towards great<br>
achievements or high ideals.<br>
<p>
Michael Scarazzo wrote 4/8/98: &lt;I followed for a while the thread that<br>
pitted Reilly Jones against the majority of the list over what amounted to<br>
a discussion of the morality of abortion....  I think that a discussion<br>
resulting in the creation of an "us and them" dichotomy, fails to exemplify<br>
and to encourage thought based on the principles of extropy.&gt;<br>
<p>
Fortunately, majorities don't manufacture truth.  Discussion that relates<br>
to what is entropic vs. extropic is always appropriate to the list. <br>
Oftentimes individuals adopt some personally convenient position that<br>
appears extropic without following the chain of moral logic to its entropic<br>
endpoint.  Exploring these chains of moral logic is often interesting and<br>
informative even if annoying and uncomfortable.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;Is life, human or transhuman, meant to be simply existence?  Should<br>
transhuman life be happy, or should it simply be existence?  I believe that<br>
life should be happy, or at least that a human has the intrinsic right to<br>
have happiness from the beginning of that existence, and even to the<br>
frequently unfortunate end.&gt;<br>
<p>
Rocks are simply existing, yet they aren't life.  Perhaps you should<br>
consider the possibility that life is qualitatively different than rocks. <br>
I could care less about happiness, especially now that it can be<br>
technologically modulated.  When we can get eudaemonia-in-a-pill, what<br>
worth is striving for knowledge, or sacrifice for achievement?  Try reading<br>
Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics" about how elusive happiness is ("feeling<br>
of conscious vitality") and think about how feeble happiness is as an ideal<br>
to develop morality by.  There is never a right to happiness.  The right to<br>
*pursue* happiness is no different than the right to pursue unhappiness, it<br>
is simply a statement of the centrality of volitional freedom to humanity<br>
(and transhumanity).<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;Wedding rational means and truth is rather difficult.  All things,<br>
events, and thoughts are relative.  Truth relates to reality and each<br>
person has his/her individual reality.&gt;<br>
<p>
Is the statement "all things are relative" a true statement?  You see how<br>
absurd such windage is?  Relativism is incoherent.  If rationality is not<br>
wedded to truth then it is clearly irrationality.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;Linking "a life affirming way" and "good" is also very subjective and<br>
difficult, because good is greatly open to interpretation...&gt;<br>
<p>
If "life affirming way" does not refer to "good" then why use the word<br>
"affirming"?  This makes no sense at all.  Any time you specify a moral<br>
direction ("way"), you are inescapably referencing the good.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  What you see as beautiful may<br>
or may not correspond to what another person sees.&gt;<br>
<p>
I see an underdeveloped imagination here.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;Your emotions have greatly confused your ability to discern between<br>
those who support a right to an action or a procedure and those who seek to<br>
expand its application(s).&gt;<br>
<p>
If you really followed the earlier discussion, you will see that I<br>
presented a rational chain of moral logic, entirely secular in nature,<br>
beginning with clear definitions and ending with clear, reasonable options.<br>
 Emotions are not a part of this presentation until the end of the<br>
consequences are reached and they are a bad end.  I was met with<br>
unintelligent bigotry, stereotyped as a religious kook, and flaming<br>
emotional irrationality was heaved my way, including a prescription for<br>
guillotining half my state for not wanting to turn our doctors into<br>
murderers, into neo-Nazi "angels of death."  My options are polycentric in<br>
nature.  The options of those who support a right to murder, by a clear<br>
chain of cause-and-effect logic, proceed to overwhelm world society with<br>
not just sanctions, which soil all those opposed to it, but inevitably<br>
statist taxpayer-funded support for it.  Extropian culture is inherently<br>
polycentric, the culture of death is inherently monocentric.  No compromise<br>
between the two can be made.  Even Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a well-known<br>
libertarian, in this week's "Washington Times" was quoted saying: "The<br>
Libertarian argument, or the principle is, you can't initiate force, you're<br>
not allowed to use violence.  We even sign a pledge.  If you're not allowed<br>
to initiate violence, you're not allowed to kill.  How can you kill a fetus<br>
without initiating violence?"  Duh...<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;I would rather have one unhappy person weeping for the child that<br>
could never be in her reality, than to have two unhappy people as the child<br>
grows into a world that it comes to despise because it is not happy.&gt;<br>
<p>
Happiness isn't everything, in fact, it's not much at all.  Individuals are<br>
remarkably resilient, the backgrounds of people throughout history show an<br>
amazing ability to make something of their lives regardless of how horrible<br>
their beginnings were, or their formative years.  Let me sum up your<br>
position here as "better dead than sad."  It's ridiculous.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;What is affirming life?  I take this phrase to mean more than<br>
affirming<br>
an individual life.  Life can refer to the general human condition, for<br>
which the extropians and transhumanists stand to improve.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is the classic twentieth-century rationalization for Stalinism,<br>
Maoism, etc.  Butchery on a mass scale to improve the general human<br>
condition at the expense of some poor slobs who just were getting in the<br>
way.  Either we have individual rights, not group rights, or we have no<br>
rights at all.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;Reilly, you are the person who wishes to force your beliefs and your<br>
truths upon everyone else.&gt;<br>
<p>
No, I am the person who has had other persons force their beliefs on me and<br>
mine, and the society I live in and am trying to raise my children in, is<br>
so much more degraded than the one I grew up in that it shocks me.  A large<br>
part of that decline is due to the way nihilism transformed into concrete<br>
expressions of the culture of death, such as abortion, infanticide and<br>
euthanasia.<br>
<p>
MS:  &lt;By saying that others are trying to make you tolerate says that<br>
because you do not tolerate those beliefs, they should not be allowed to<br>
continue.  THAT is forcing beliefs on others.&gt;<br>
<p>
No, I am repeatedly saying we should have extropic polycentric solutions,<br>
only the culture of death will not allow them, it's internal logic forces<br>
sanctioned and taxpayer-supported butchery on all jurisdictions by<br>
*necessity*.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;Do you not think that there are already enough unhappy people in the<br>
world?&gt;<br>
<p>
Who cares?  Life's tough.  Let them work it out for themselves without<br>
murdering innocents on the way.<br>
<p>
MS: &lt;I personally believe that abortion, particularly late-term, should be<br>
avoided at all costs, unless there are dire circumstances, such as the<br>
threat to a woman's life.&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, of the 35 million innocent unborn children murdered in the U.S. since<br>
Roe v. Wade, the best estimates are that less than 3% were for<br>
life-of-the-mother, rape or incest.  If only 1 million had been murdered<br>
during this time span, the culture of death's devaluing of life would not<br>
have extended its grip nearly so hard on us.  We would have a lot more<br>
happy citizens on the streets than we do now.  There'd be a lot more<br>
brainpower in our pool. There'd be a lot more women around.<br>
