My work area is not as concentration conducive as it will be when I<br>
re-assemble it.  However, most of my distractions are internal.  My mind<br>
is a really noisy place.  I've recently been engaged in a handfull of<br>
projects each requiring different modes of thinking(music, mathematics,<br>
coding, writing, video production).  Some of them are more engaing (music)<br>
than others and clearing my head when I switch tasks is the part of the<br>
problem I'm trying to work out at this time.  I've made some progress<br>
simply by realizing and acknowledging what the problem is.  (The problem<br>
could be that I spread my self to thin, but I'm not going to drop anything<br>
I find fullfilling until I've made an effort to sharpen myself.)<br>
Meditation seems to me as something I should try, but my first look into<br>
the subject revealed mostly mystic-type communing with mystic-type stuff,<br>
which I'm not concerned with.  I just want to think more clearly and with<br>
greater focus.<br>
