Of course.  Do you see drool on my lip?  :)<br>
<p>
The difficulty with the most detailed natural psi experiments such as Lotto<br>
is, as I mentioned, that the owners of the data are usually unwilling to<br>
disgorge it more than once. But my work so far has set severe upper limits<br>
on any population incidence of psi (which might, of course, turn out to be<br>
zilch).<br>
<p>
BTW, Dr Radin (whose book I cited several times) was given the boot from<br>
University of Las Vegas, and his research centre closed down, on dubious<br>
grounds last year.  His side of the story can be sampled at<br>
<p>
 www.psiresearch.org/crlthes.htm<br>
<p>
Further to my critical remarks about the tacky and misleading cover/title<br>
of his book, this exchange:<br>
<p>
ME:<br>
<i>&gt;I was disturbed when you used the shorthand (e.g.) `odds of a hundred to</i><br>
<i>&gt;one' = `probability of one in 100'.  I've been snide at Randi for doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;this, when he meant `odds of 99 to one'.</i><br>
<p>
RADIN:<br>
&lt; Yes, I know.  I had to make lots of strategic decisions about how to<br>
present odds.  I figured that while p = .01 is not exactly the same as odds<br>
of 100 to 1, it was close enough for the expected audience, and for any<br>
practical purposes in my exposition.  But I'll add a footnote about this on<br>
the next edition for the purists.  BTW, the title and the jacket cover were<br>
not my choice.  I was quite angry about the cover in particular. You can<br>
probably tell this was the marketing folks' idea of what I was writing about.&gt;<br>
