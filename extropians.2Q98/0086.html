<i>&gt; Well,  I've done it again - gotten myself into a bind.  I was caught in</i><br>
<i>&gt; my Freshman Seminar class reading the latest installment of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropian Principles,  and was forced to give a small lecture on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject matter (i.e. - explaining to everyone what extropy was).  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested my FreshSem teacher enough for her to give me that as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; essay subject.  Now I must relate "Extropian values in accordance to</i><br>
<i>&gt; slavery" with the Harriet Jacobs book "Incidents in the Life of a Slave</i><br>
<i>&gt; Girl".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyone have any ideas for subject matter for me?  I've read through the</i><br>
<i>&gt; book and through the Extropian Principles,  but I need to write an essay</i><br>
<i>&gt; that my teacher will be able to comprehend - and that drastically</i><br>
<i>&gt; reduces my options.  Assigned on Friday,  I need to have it done by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wednesday.  Eep.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any help would be appreciated,  as I'm not accustomed to writing</i><br>
<i>&gt; analytical essays.</i><br>

You might look up extropian and transhumanists writings on the UIF<br>
principle, which is central to our thought on many things. UIF stands for<br>
Unlimited Individual Freedom. In this context, being extropian is about as<br>
far from being a slave or condoning slavery as one could possibly get. You<br>
could also say that they stand at opposite ends of the evolutionary scale,<br>
where at one time in our past, all humans were slaves to one thing or<br>
another, either slaves to a master in a labor arrangement, women being<br>
enslaved to men and to their wombs, a vassal to lord relationship, or all<br>
humans to the politically correct deity that is worshipped. Extropians on<br>
the other hand, deny the ability or right of any force, being, or situation<br>
to enslave the individual to it. We demand of ourselves the will and<br>
perseverance to bend the universe to our own ends, not ours to its. We shall<br>
overcome the greatest form of slavery, the slavery of mortality, and the<br>
slavery of limited intellect as well. In this we live up to and move beyond<br>
the finest dream of proponents of indvidual liberty like DuBois, Douglas,<br>
and King, as well as Jefferson and Franklin, Rand and Paine<br>
