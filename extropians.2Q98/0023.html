<i>&gt; Good laws are no different than anything else, if you want to maximize  </i><br>
<i>&gt; something make it a commodity and sell it on the free market. Nobody does  </i><br>
<i>&gt; that for law very much, that's why there are far more good cars than good </i><br>
<i>&gt; laws.  Privately produced law in a world without government would have </i><br>
<i>&gt; Private Protection Agencies (PPA's) to back them up. Disputes among PPA's </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be settled by an independent arbitrator agreed to by both parties </i><br>
<i>&gt; BEFORE the disagreement happened. Something like that can exist today. </i><br>
<i>&gt; When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree on who </i><br>
<i>&gt; will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen. Nobody wants to </i><br>
<i>&gt; get caught up in the slow, expensive court system run by governments. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The arbitrator is paid by the case, and because he is picked by both sides, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's in his interest to be as just as possible. If he favored one side over </i><br>
<i>&gt; another or made brutal or stupid decisions he would not be picked again and  </i><br>
<i>&gt; would need to look for a new line of work. Unlike present day judges and </i><br>
<i>&gt; juries, justice would have a positive survival value for the arbitrator. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing  </i><br>
<i>&gt; parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence  </i><br>
<i>&gt; is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; the total level of violence to be less than in the nation state system we  </i><br>
<i>&gt; have now, but I'm not such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even when force is not used the implicit threat is always there, another good  </i><br>
<i>&gt; reason to be civilized. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please note that I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a rich  </i><br>
<i>&gt; man's PPA makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on  </i><br>
<i>&gt; my mother being the judge if I get into trouble) it's going to need one hell </i><br>
<i>&gt; of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is expensive </i><br>
<i>&gt; because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages it will </i><br>
<i>&gt; need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for all this </i><br>
<i>&gt; they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely limiting their </i><br>
<i>&gt; customer base and that means even higher charges. They could never get the </i><br>
<i>&gt; upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to outspend a PPA that </i><br>
<i>&gt; had outrageous demands and was just for the super rich. A yacht cost a lot </i><br>
<i>&gt; more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer than all the yacht </i><br>
<i>&gt; builders on the planet combined.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the  </i><br>
<i>&gt; greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one  </i><br>
<i>&gt; man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans  </i><br>
<i>&gt; could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,   </i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews would be willing to pay as  </i><br>
<i>&gt; much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be  </i><br>
<i>&gt; killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a result the PPA protecting Jews would be much stronger than the one that  </i><br>
<i>&gt; wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you  </i><br>
<i>&gt; (like not getting killed) you have much more influence than just one man one </i><br>
<i>&gt; vote.        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
so a billionaire's whim would be much more powerful than any "standard"<br>
indivual's greatest desire.  What would stop someone like Bill Gates from<br>
doing what he will with 10000000 Indians?  Not to mention that most<br>
people's wieldable money (spare money?) is much less than 2% of a rich<br>
person's spare money.  Also, what's the difference between a large PPA and<br>
a standard nation state, in which you pay taxes to be protected?  <br>
What will protect you from your own PPA?<br>
