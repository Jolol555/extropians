Its actually a pretty pathetic religion that does not explain anything. Keep in<br>
mind that religion formed as an organized class to maintain knowledge of a<br>
social groups history, mythology, and intellectual property. In its time,<br>
successfull religions explained everything sufficiently for the man of the<br>
time. That science has surpassed religion in its ability to explain the<br>
universe in a more consistent manner that is congruent with observed fact is an<br>
indication that most of mankind has or is moving beyond religion as the major<br>
means of explaining the universe. This is extropic to say the least. This is<br>
not to say that any religion, in its original form, was not extropic for the<br>
time in which it was formed. Organized structures like religions do, however,<br>
become obsolescent with time if they cannot change sufficiently to meet the<br>
changing times.<br>
<p>
Any religion which cannot explain anything to the satisfaction of even a small<br>
group of people is nothing more than either a dead mythology or a quaint form<br>
of meditative exercise.<br>
