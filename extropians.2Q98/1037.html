<p>
	Watch yourself here.  Sending a simple black and white photo<br>
presupposes:<br>
<p>
	1)  That they have electromagnetic vision similar to ours.<br>
<p>
granted.  but practically all complex lifeforms on this planet have evolved<br>
such a system.<br>
it is inherently useful in nearly all imaginable environments.<br>
<p>
	2) That their vision is at the same frequency as our - highly<br>
improbable.  <br>
<p>
 i agree: their vision would most likely be a different spectrum. but it<br>
wouldnt need to<br>
 be the same spectrum as ours for a black and white image to be informative<br>
to them.<br>
<p>
	3)  That they would have the same spatial awareness to put something<br>
into a 2-d<br>
	grid.  <br>
<p>
we should explore what is the simplest possible "grid".  is that a 2-d<br>
rectangular<br>
matrix?  even if et has a different system as you suggest, it would occur to<br>
them to<br>
try the simplest possible grid.  <br>
<p>
	As a test it would be fun to take an x-ray photograph of a jellyfish<br>
and then<br>
	digitize it into 0's and 1's and then send this binary coded message<br>
to SETI to<br>
	see if they can interpret it.  Depending on how clever they are, it<br>
could take<br>
	them years to figure out what it is.<br>
<p>
something like this has been tested.  seti scientists sent a bunch of bits<br>
to a number<br>
of smart people.  the number of bits was the product of two prime numbers.<br>
they<br>
reported that every test subject figured out to put the bits in a m by n<br>
matrix and color<br>
in the 1s (or 0s) to form a picture.  <br>
<p>
it would be a cool challenge to try to design a number of b/w pictures to<br>
send to<br>
et that would encourage technology exchange, mutual understanding etc.  <br>
thanks for the input!  spike<br>
