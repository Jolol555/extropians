You're a human; you need to think ahead.  Losing will do no good if you just<br>
gain it back.  Healthwise you'll be worse off than you were in the first<br>

Harder than you might think.  On ketotic diets, you must essentially eat<br>
*nothing*<br>
but meat, eggs, cream, and oils (25 grams of carbohydrate is one carrot a<br>
day). <br>
No candy, no dessert, no fruit, no milk, no vegetables, no bread, not even<br>
ketchup.  <br>
Yuck.  <br>

<p>
Since you can eat what you want, this is basically true.  Some of the research<br>
literature claims ketotic dieters develop carbohydrate craving for the foods<br>
they can't eat.  So you'll really want that candy bar, even though you're not<br>
hungry.<br>
