Information is measured in number of bits (or more commonly kilobytes or<br>
megabytes). This measure does not tell you much about meaning of the<br>
information. If I would convert this mail to a gif picture or an mpeg<br>
slideshow it would take more information to hold it, and perhaps give a<br>
heavier hype measure (or spam measure), but it wouldn't contain more<br>
meaning.<br>
<p>
The concept of Exformation is on the other hand more meaningful. When you<br>
buy milk, butter and eggs, you get a receipt containing a list of these<br>
items and a total. The list contains more information that the total, but<br>
you are more interested in the total, because that is what you will pay to<br>
the cashier. The total contains more Exformation.<br>
<p>
The total is computed using the addition algorithm, and in fact the purpose<br>
of any algorithm (the useful ones at least) is to produce exformation, not<br>
information. Information is not good in itself, the less you can do with,<br>
the better (ok, I know there are some info-junkies out there :-).<br>
<p>
The interesting question is, how is exformation measured? I claim that<br>
exformation is measured as money. It fits nicesly in the<br>
production-consumption theory. You produce exformation, sell it to someone,<br>
who consumes the information. Although I'm just an economist wannabe, I<br>
would like to go as far as to say that exformation *is* money. You don't<br>
know how valuable something is/was until you actually sell it. But as<br>
exformation is laos closely related to algorithmic complexity, exformation<br>
may be measured as time. So money is time. The time someone has to spend<br>
instead of spending money.<br>
<p>
The definition of Extropy (in The Extropians Principles) says it is a<br>
measure of Information (among other things), but more accurately this should<br>
be Exformation. So if Exformation is one measure of Extropy, perhaps Bill<br>
Gates really is the greates Extropian among us.<br>
