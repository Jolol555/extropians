<p>
I don't want to appear to be an all out defender of hermeneutics, but<br>
here goes...<br>
<p>
I agree authorial intent should be part of literary criticism, though it should<br>
not be the do all be all of it.  The influence a text (or anything for that<br>
matter) often goes well beyond what the author intended.  A writer's goal<br>
is not always clear -- hence the debates on the meaning of Homer's epics<br>
that go on to this day.  There is also open deception.  Thirdly, unintended<br>
consequences creep in, as they creep into every intended thing, e.g.,<br>
welfare policies.  Should we not apply the same idea to literature?  Surely,<br>
the writers of the Bible did not intend for Ayn Rand to use their symbolism<br>
in her novels -- as the late Ronald Merrill proclaimed in his _The Ideas of<br>
Ayn Rand_?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"...philosophical hermeneutics is not concerned with verifiable accounts</i><br>
<i>&gt;and, as noted above, it denies the possibility of objective knowledge.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Instead, it argues that only a person who stands in history, subject to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the prejudices of his age, can hope to understand it. A valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding of an event, interaction or text is one that bridges history</i><br>
<i>&gt;or socio-cultural differences to highlight the inquirer's situation." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problems with both of these philosophies for capitalism is apparent;</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's impossible to enforce a contract as law if meaning does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;ultimately spring from authorial intent or if the referent of the contract </i><br>
<i>&gt;varies, depending on the reader's background and upbringing.  We might be</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to make a little headway if we were to assert that legal contracts</i><br>
<i>&gt;are necessarily written in a formal meta-language remarkably LIKE English,</i><br>
<i>&gt;a language designed in such a way as to be infinitely more precise than</i><br>
<i>&gt;our own.  However, even this formulation is not without problems, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't help us to get around the greater problems presented to us by</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophical hermeneutics, which I think we ultimately must reject if we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are to accept the existence of an objective reality impervious to</i><br>
<i>&gt;interpretation.</i><br>
<p>
I agree, though some of the methods of hermeneutics are transplantable<br>
and useful outside the above quoted context.  The problem of<br>
interpretation, if consistently applied, also makes non-capitalist systems<br>
unviable.  How can the people vote for central planners in democratic<br>
socialism IF each individual is so mired in her context that she can't<br>
communicate with others?  How can Marxists or Fascists interpret the<br>
forces of history -- be they embodied by the proletariat or the nation --<br>
correctly, IF no objective rendering is possible?  This extreme position<br>
-- that any interpretation is equal and inconmensurable with any other<br>
interpretation -- is obviously false, but it does not help anyone to support<br>
any political or social system.<br>
<p>
The only reason, I believe, many academics support anticapitalist systems<br>
is just that they traditionally have done so.  Despite all these radical<br>
philosophies, the university has always been a very conservative place.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
