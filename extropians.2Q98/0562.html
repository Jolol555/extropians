History written by Marxists/socialists makes capitalism look oppressive,<br>

Go back and reread what I said in my second response to you.  "...  if<br>
organizing in another way would improve efficiency, then I suspect you'd<br>
see more organizations incorporating it.  But I'm not sure about this."  To<br>
state my opinion more clearly, I'm totally in favor of co-ops in<br>
competition if that improves economic efficiency.  However, that's a far<br>
cry from embracing the abolition of capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I know you're probably opposed to the very idea, but try reading an</i><br>

<i>&gt;You don't know that I have had studied okonomy.</i><br>

I'm sure that you have.  But what I suggested is that you read an<br>

<p>
First of all, this is simply untrue.  The real income of the poor (which is<br>
income adjusted for inflation) has undergone severe fluctuations over the<br>
last 30 years, both up and down.  The 70s were marked by severe inflation,<br>
while the beginning of the 80s started in recession, then pulled out again<br>
by deficit spending, then dragged back into recession again when Bush<br>
increased taxes and cut spending to recover a runaway deficit.  Inflation<br>
now is at an unparalleled low and I'm proud to say that real income,<br>
including and especially that of the poor, has been higher throughout this<br>
decade (even including the recession of the early ninties) than in the 70s.<br>
<p>
Care to check my data?  <a href="http://www.census.gov">http://www.census.gov</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Who produce your products? The managment? Of course, the workers.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, it usually takes both.  Workers must coordinate their efforts in<br>
order to produce; one way to do so is by having people whose sole job is to<br>
coordinate.  And before you tell me that the workers can manage themsleves,<br>
let me also add that I AGREE that the workers can manage themselves: the<br>
manager is a worker too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Only  </i><br>
<i>&gt;work gave the managment products to sell. So the managment need workers.  </i><br>
<p>
The management ARE workers, at least under capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And the managment need buyers to sell their products and to survive in  </i><br>
<i>&gt;competition.</i><br>
<p>
They need buyers to stay in business.  The management would not die if a<br>
recession happened next year.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Every product have a price -- and this price is subordinated  </i><br>
<i>&gt;to all other prices for the same product of other firms who act in the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;same business. The competition force the high of the price who the firms  </i><br>
<i>&gt;can earn at the market.</i><br>
<p>
Please don't take this in the wrong way... I don't mean this as a joke or<br>
as an insult, but I'm having a really hard time understanding your English.<br>
 I think your last sentance should read "Competition forces (sets?) the<br>
height of the price which the firms can earn in the market."  If I've<br>
misread you, please correct me.  And if I've read you correctly, then I<br>
agree with this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This price represent partly the costs of produc- </i><br>
<i>&gt;tion: interests, materialcosts, firmownerloans, costs of promotion, tax,  </i><br>
<i>&gt;wages etc. If one buyer buy a product than he pay all this costs. And the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;majority of this buyers are workers who spend their money which they earn  </i><br>
<i>&gt;as wage.</i><br>
<p>
In microeconomics, labor is not the source of all value, but rather labor<br>
is a product which workers make using their "human capital."  The price of<br>
this labor is ALSO set by competition, just like all other market goods;<br>
just like how consumers can't and don't expect goods at an arbitrarily low<br>
price, firms can't and don't expect more labor at lower wages than workers<br>
are willing to supply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Every firm hope to earn more money if they selling their products as they  </i><br>
<i>&gt;have had spend to produce them. Marx call this "Mehrwert" -- value adding.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;And every firm payed wages to the workers who are under that value adding,  </i><br>
<i>&gt;because their workers work is just one point in the list of cost of pro- </i><br>
<i>&gt;ducing. -- This is the theory of labor which you don't reject with your  </i><br>
<i>&gt;nice picture above.  The workers can only earn wages who are under that va- </i><br>
<i>&gt;lue adding who pay capital gains of capital investments by as well firm  </i><br>
<i>&gt;owners as outside capital owners.</i><br>
<p>
Underlying this theory is the highly contestable assertion that "the<br>
management" doesn't do any economically useful work.  After all, we EXPECT<br>
value adding to happen if value is actually added, as when workers turn raw<br>
steel into a car door.  And the fact of the matter is that capital owners<br>
DO work, and thus deserve a just return on their OWN labor.<br>
<p>
Owners of capital must make decisions on how to invest their capital, in<br>
what forms, and with whom.  These are not trivial decisions, nor can they<br>
be made lightly.  Despite what people say about "old boy networks,"<br>
investing in one's friends simply because they are friendly is highly<br>
detrimental to one's own economic livelihood.  The rich do not stay rich<br>
for long with this investment strategy.  (Instead, "old boy networks"<br>
usually tend to consist of those (WASP men, sadly) who have consistently<br>
proven themselves to be the money makers in society, not just any old<br>
fuddy-duddies who happen to own capital.)  The best way to invest is with<br>
those who can make the most money:  those who can produce the most<br>
efficiently, at the lowest cost to the greatest number; those who can<br>
provide the greatest service to the community, as measured by the amount<br>
which the community is willing to pay for it.  <br>
<p>
Again, this is no easy decision to make.  It often requires intimate<br>
knowledge of the people involved, the tools being used, the demand for the<br>
product being offered, etc.  And there's no question that investing in this<br>
way requires intelligence and skills which not all people have.  By<br>
allowing those capitalists to collect their rightfully earned return on<br>
their capital, a decentralized system of voluntary market coordination<br>
develops, one which ultimately tends towards greater efficiency and greater<br>
wealth for all than a democratic allocation of resources.<br>
<p>
Capitalists do economically useful work.  Not only do they do useful work,<br>
but their work is far more scarce (and in much greater demand) than most<br>
other labor due to the complicated and difficult nature of their task.<br>
Meanwhile, manual laboring, which Marx sees as the only source of value, is<br>
in abundant supply.  Due to this, and the fact that it is under<br>
capitalism's voluntary coordination that the richest nations have<br>
prospered, I say with most certainty that the capitalist's task is in many<br>
ways more valuable than the manual laborer's job.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; When there is only ONE buyer of labor, however, the firm has complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; freedom to set the price of labor to be whatever it wants, which workers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; must accept because there is no one else to whom they can sell labor.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is how Marx viewed the labor market, and it is clearly wrong, which we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; observe empirically: there are MANY different firms out there, each</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; offering different wages and producing goods of different quality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nonsense. </i><br>
<p>
Look, I'm prepared to discuss this matter if you'd like, but I need a<br>
little more to go on.  Care to expand on this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You forgot here the back of this class war. If the firms space out there  </i><br>
<i>&gt;workers and force them to live from there wages investments in the union  </i><br>
<i>&gt;than the workers must return to work if their collectively owned money is  </i><br>
<i>&gt;out. Than they have to acept every wage because they need money to survi- </i><br>
<i>&gt;ve. And every firm are able to dismiss all striking workers and to hire  </i><br>
<i>&gt;other workers.</i><br>
<p>
Let's examine what you're saying economically.<br>
<p>
I'm saying that in perfect competition, the market for labor looks like this:<br>
<p>
Wages |\_           _/ &lt;-- supply<br>
<i>      |  \_       _/</i><br>
<i>      |    \_   _/</i><br>
   W* |______\_/<br>
<i>      |     _/^\_</i><br>
<i>      |   _/  |  \_</i><br>
<i>      | _/    |    \_</i><br>
<i>      |/      |      \ &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      ----------------------<br>
              E*<br>
           Employment<br>
<p>
Wages are set entirely by the market in this imaginary model.  Workers are<br>
unwilling to work for less than a certain wage at a given employment level<br>
(given by the supply cuve), and will seek other firms rather than work in<br>
such conditions.  Firms are unable to pay more than a certain wage at a<br>
given employment level (shown here as the demand curve).  Workers make<br>
surplus utility on their labor, given by the area above the supply curve<br>
and below the price; firms make surplus profit given by the area below the<br>
demand curve and above the price.  Firms which attempt to lower wages do<br>
not receive any labor supplied as all workers substitute into other firms;<br>
firms which attempt to increase wages operate at a loss.<br>
<p>
However, the market for labor probably doesn't look like this.  To some<br>
extent, it may look monopsonistic, like this:<br>
<p>
Wages |\_ MFC&gt;/     _/ &lt;-- supply<br>
<i>      |  \_  /    _/</i><br>
<i>      |    \/   _/</i><br>
<i>      |    / \_/</i><br>
<i>      |   / _/ \_</i><br>
    WM|__/_/     \_<br>
<i>      | // ^       \_</i><br>
<i>      |/   |         \ &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      ----------------------<br>
           EM<br>
           Employment<br>
<p>
A monopsonist suffers a larger marginal cost of labor than simply the<br>
supply curve, since the firm must increase the wage level in order to<br>
increase the labor supply.  Since the firm will only produce until its<br>
marginal revenue is equal to its marginal costs, it will employ a smaller<br>
number of workers (EM) and pay them less (WM).<br>
<p>
This is all good and well, except that if workers DO suffer under a<br>
monopsony, then their supply is likely much much greater.  (ie they will<br>
accept lower wages for the same level of employment).  There is very little<br>
that one won't accept, as you note, when not accepting means not eating.<br>
Destitution leads to a huge increase in the labor supply.  So instead the<br>
monopsonist would face this supply curve and marginal cost: (enlarged for<br>
clarity)<br>
<p>
Wages |\__                 __/   &lt;-- MFC<br>
<i>      |   \__           __/</i><br>
<i>      |      \__     __/</i><br>
<i>      |         \___/       ____  &lt;-- supply</i><br>
<i>      |        __/^\__ ____/</i><br>
    W*|---  __/ -&gt;|___\__<br>
<i>      | ___/ ____/|      \__</i><br>
<i>      |/____/     |          \  &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      -----------------------------<br>
                  E*<br>
           Employment<br>
<p>
Workers are prepared to accept much lower wages (though still not<br>
arbitrarily low) for the same level of employment as would be existing<br>
under perfect competition.  In all likelihood, I've probably even<br>
overestimated the slope of this supply curve:  it should remain almost zero<br>
for a little longer.<br>
<p>
Now we can see that we should be asking questions like these:  Do workers<br>
actually have a supply curve this low, and if so, how can we increase it?<br>
I think the answer to the first question is no, for two reasons:  employees<br>
ARE able to switch firms if wages are too low; they are also wealthy enough<br>
to strike if switching firms would be too costly. <br>
<p>
How we could cause the supply curve to increase?  The answer is simple:<br>
increase the substitution and income effects by increasing the number and<br>
availability of firms so that employees can switch industries/firms more<br>
easily, and by helping wealth per capita to increase.  Having more wealth<br>
should result in an income effect, (at least with respect to "inferior<br>
goods," if not immediately with respect to the quantity of employment<br>
supplied,) which allows employees to invest in their wages more easily.<br>
<p>
The fact that workers DO strike and that they do switch firms for better<br>
pay indicates that these effects are ALREADY taking place; however, I also<br>
agree with the argument for helping them to take place even more than they<br>
are now.  However, this is still no argument  against capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Many firms didn't acepted union members generally. In the USA are just 15%  </i><br>
<i>&gt;of all workers in an union.... I think, you have to notice that we have an  </i><br>
<i>&gt;diffrent capitalism after the New Deal of 1913 -- which Marx who died seve- </i><br>
<i>&gt;ral years before havn't known.</i><br>
<p>
The percentage of unionized workers says very little to me.  In fact,<br>
considering how the unions have lobbied so heavily (and have permanently<br>
entrenched themselves) in their right to free assembly, it seems to me that<br>
the reason more workers aren't part of unions is not that they find it too<br>
difficult, but simply that it is not worth the effort.  They're getting a<br>
great wage as it is, the economy is still booming and people are wealthier<br>
today than they were in previous decades.  What do they need to strike for?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't suggest this. I havn't proposed that workers are forced to earn  </i><br>
<i>&gt;wages of one firm's to survive. I have proposed that workers are forced to  </i><br>
<i>&gt;sell their work and have therefore to be on the staff of one of the phara- </i><br>
<i>&gt;os.</i><br>
<p>
Capitalists can't (legally) chain anybody to anything under lf-capitalism.<br>
In this way, capitalists are fundamentally different from pharaohs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They could only change their jobs if there are other firms in their re- </i><br>
<i>&gt;gion who seek for new workers in their training-groups. If they lose there  </i><br>
<i>&gt;jobs and havn't the right qualification than they are unenployed -- inde-  </i><br>
<i>&gt;pended of how industrious they are.</i><br>
<p>
Industrious people are in high demand in a capitalist economy; due to their<br>
industriousness, they also tend not to get themselves unemployed.  So IMO,<br>
this doesn't happen as much as you say it does.  However, we can't measure<br>
industriousness, so I don't think we can have a reasonable discussion about<br>
it.<br>
<p>
And as to when people are or aren't able to change their jobs, I think I<br>
have a surprise for you.  Millions of people across the country switch jobs<br>
DAILY, for all kinds of different reasons; among these reasons (and a<br>
popular one at that) is better pay.  Are you trying to tell me that this<br>
doesn't happen?  That they can't?  That the capitalists won't let them?<br>
You're wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your mistake is, that your thinking about the labor market use a universal  </i><br>
<i>&gt;worker and don't deal with workers of diffrent qualifications.</i><br>
<p>
This is outrageous!  Above I said that "... there are MANY different firms<br>
out there, each offering different wages and producing goods of different<br>
quality," and you called it nonsense!  Now you're telling me that I don't<br>
deal with workers of different qualifications?  Give me a break!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A worker  </i><br>
<i>&gt;with the qualification to assemble cars cannot produce tomorrow computer- </i><br>
<i>&gt;chips without a long training to get a new qualification. A doctor who ha-  </i><br>
<i>&gt;ve studied physik couldn't sell his work as a doctore of medicine.</i><br>
<p>
No, but there's more than one car maker out there, and more than one<br>
computer chip maker, and more than one university, and more than one<br>
hospital, so most people still have ample room to change jobs within their<br>
own industry without much difficulty.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately are 51% of all costs of labor costs of transactions; it's  </i><br>
<i>&gt;cheaper for the firm's today and tomorrow to do this work with a PC. 51%  </i><br>
<i>&gt;of all jobs get lost in the coming time sequence of the next 30 years. All  </i><br>
<i>&gt;other jobs will in future need more and more an academic qualification.</i><br>
<p>
Labor-saving innovations lead to lost jobs, huh?  They also bring down the<br>
price of everything, resulting in increased wealth for everyone relative to<br>
the price level.  What more do you want from technology?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;The structure of the military is as well hirarchically as the structure of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;the industry. Both have structures where competence and responsibility are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;split from the top to the bottom; the people on the top make the decisions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;and have a high responsibillity whereas the people at the bottom carry out</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;orders with a low responsibillity; only the managment -- the industrial</i><br>
ge-<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;neral staff -- could change the production and the structure of the firm</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;and have command of this structure of working.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This is true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, and therefore the real capitalism is for myself in opposite to "spon- </i><br>
<i>&gt;taneous orders".</i><br>
<p>
They are spontaneous because they are formed voluntarily and therefore<br>
spontaneously.  But even if I cede to you that corporations aren't<br>
spontaneous, (which I don't,) capitalism does NOT require people to form<br>
corporations: co-operatives are as much a capitalistic phenomenon as<br>
corporations, and they're BOTH spontaneous.<br>
