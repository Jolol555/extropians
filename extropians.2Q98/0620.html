<i>&gt; : If the government has no knowledge of aliens, then why does Title 14,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations, implemented on July</i><br>
<i>&gt; : 16, 1969, make it illegal for U.S. citizens to have any contact with</i><br>
<i>&gt; : extraterrestrials or their vehicles?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is one of those experiments where people post fiction and see how</i><br>
<i>&gt; long it is believed, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can search the Code of Federal Regulations at </i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html">http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html</a>.</i><br>
<p>
You don't even have to search the code--just search the archives<br>
of /this list/ to see that the Alien Quarantine code was repealed<br>
years ago.  Of course, even if it /were/ still in effect, how<br>
does that give any credibility at all to their existence?<br>
<p>
(P.S. I removed the attributions here because I think they're<br>
wrong--I know the man who is credited with the original comment,<br>
and he has a brain, so I assume it wasn't really him).<br>
