Damien Broderick writes from Melbourne, where I happily used to live <br>
(Ivanhoe; Eaglemont):<br>

<i>&gt; I have a terrible sinking feeling that more than one of the geniuses on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list read the purported study forwarded by Tony Hollick (by Cat,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thomas H. and Ray Fiddle [1983], wasn't it, or am I thinking of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; skepticism poll conducted by Hither, Adolph and Yon, I [1882]?) as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; serious academic paper.</i><br>

      <br>
      When I read the aforesaid 'paper' over on 'forteana' (the 'Fortean <br>
      Times' conference), I thought it made a good point (or two), leaving <br>
      aside the 'supporting evidence' and addressing the _hypotheses <br>
      themselves_.<br>
      <br>
      One of the glories of Critical Rationalism is that all we really <br>
      need be concerned with is the content of ideas.  Their source, <br>
      'confirmation', 'authority' and so on are quite unimportant.  A <br>
      hypothesis may be true even if everyone disbelieves it; it may be <br>
      false even while everyone agrees with it.<br>
      <br>
      I append a lovely essay by Karl Popper which makes these points <br>
      rather better than I.<br>
      <br>
      PS: Damien: I likely would have attended Melbourne U. had I not been <br>
      given a three-day ultimatum to be flogged in the showers by the <br>
      prefects at Geelong Grammar School; this was two weeks before my <br>
      Matriculation exams (over 90% in the mocks), after I called a <br>
      prefect an 'impolite bastard.'  John Gray Gorton's hapless son Robin <br>
      was being given 'leadership training).<br>
      <br>
      Despite this foolishness, I rather like Australia. &gt;:-}<br>
      <br>
      PPS: Was your reference to 'Cat, Thomas H' an intuition, or have you <br>
      perchance picked up a meme from the brilliant '50s TV series <br>
      'T.H.E. Cat' (Thomas Hewitt Edward Cat)?<br>

TITLE:           *** WELCOME TO 'PHYSICS/GENERAL' ***<br>
<p>
      "... seen as the result of human endeavour, of human dreams, hopes, <br>
passions, and most of all, as the result of the most admirable union <br>
of creative imagination and rational critical thought, I should like <br>
to write 'Science' with the biggest capital 'S' to be found in the <br>
printer's upper case.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Science is not only like art and literature, an adventure of the human<br>
spirit, but it is among the creative arts perhaps the most human: full of<br>
human failings and shortsightedness, it shows those flashes of insight<br>
which open our eyes to the wonders of the world and of the human spirit.<br>
But this is not all. Science is the direct result of that most human of all<br>
human endeavours - to liberate ourselves. It is part of our endeavour to see<br>
more clearly, to understand the world and ourselves, and to act as adult,<br>
responsible and enlightened beings. <br>
<p>
      'Enlightenment', Kant wrote, 'is the emancipation of man from <br>
       self-imposed tutelage . . . from a state of incapacity to use <br>
       his own intelligence without external guidance.  Such a state <br>
       of tutelage I call "self-imposed" if it is due not to any lack <br>
       of intelligence but the lack of courage or determination to use <br>
       one's own intelligence instead of relying upon a leader.  <br>
       *Sapere Aude!*  Dare to use your own intelligence! This is the <br>
       maxim of the Enlightenment.' [ref. 6, Immanuel Kant, 'Was ist <br>
       Aufklarung?']<br>
<p>
<p>
  Kant challenges us to use our intelligence instead of relying upon a<br>
leader, upon an authority. This should be taken as a challenge to<br>
reject even the scientific expert as a leader, or even *science itself*<br>
Science has no authority. It is not the magical product of the given,<br>
the data, the observations. It is not a gospel of truth. It is the result<br>
of our own endeavours and mistakes. It is you and I who make science,<br>
as well as we can. It is you and I who are responsible for it...<br>
<p>
<p>
  The nuclear bomb (and possibly also the so-called 'peaceful use of<br>
atomic energy' whose consequences may be even worse in the long run)<br>
have, I think, shown us the shallowness of the worship of science as an<br>
'instrument' of our 'command over nature' or the 'control of our physical<br>
environment': it has shown us that this command, this control, is apt to be<br>
self-defeating, and apt to enslave us rather than to make us free - if it<br>
does not do away with us altogether. <br>
<p>
<p>
  And while knowledge is worth dying for, power is not. (Knowledge is <br>
one of the few things that are worth dying for, together with liberty, <br>
love, kindness, and helping those who are in need of help)."<br>

Sir Karl Popper, F. R. S., held fourteen honorary Doctorates from American,<br>
British, German, Austrian, New Zealand and Canadian universites.<br>
<p>
      He was a member (or honorary member) of twelve academies, among them <br>
      the three oldest that still exist.<br>
<p>
      Works of his have been translated into over 30 languages.<br>
<p>
<p>
      But Sir Karl was never impressed by great reputations, least of all <br>
      his own.<br>
