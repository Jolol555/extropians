My apologies for the delay in posting this to the list. I get the digest <br>
version. I would appreciate any responses be cc'd directly to my e-mail. <br>

&lt;&lt; &gt; Religion is trying to help humans in their<br>
 lives, but not forcing them to believe &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Since when?  Every major religion on this planet has as a core tenet </i><br>
<i>&gt;some variation on the theme that if you are not "of them" you will </i><br>
<i>&gt;suffer some horrific consequence and instructs its followers to go &gt;out </i><br>
and "save" those who are non-believers.  Missionaries have as one &gt;of <br>
their main goals the conversion of "infidels" into believers.  <br>
<i>&gt;Religions and the practisers thereof have routinely and consistently </i><br>
<i>&gt;attempted to control the behaviour of all peoples, not just those who </i><br>
<i>&gt;are its followers.</i><br>
<p>
    While I grant that this true for the majority of western religions, <br>
it is not true for all western religions, nor does it apply to most of <br>
the eastern religious/philosophical disciplines. Of the Western <br>
religions, one of the oldest is Paganism, which has as a fundamental <br>
principle that "believers" cannot impress their beliefs on others <br>
without being directly asked. Like most of the eastern belief systems, <br>
Paganism considers it incorrect to interfere with another's life path <br>
without permission. The exception to this rule being actions taken to <br>
protect an innocent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;While it is certainly true that for some people religion, with its </i><br>
<i>&gt;customs, rituals, and tradition, brings stability, comfort, and peace </i><br>
<i>&gt;of mind, all to often they insist that I and all others embrace their </i><br>
<i>&gt;need and their belief system.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;It has been said on this list that it is only fanatics who act in &gt;this </i><br>
manner, yet I can offer you an easy experiment to demonstrate <br>
<i>&gt;otherwise.  Wear a t-shirt out some weekend with a religious message </i><br>
<i>&gt;printed on it..Jesus Saves or some such.  You will rarely if at all &gt;be </i><br>
remarked upon.  Go out the next weekend wearing a t-shirt with an <br>
<i>&gt;anti-religious statement on it.  Observe the difference in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;behaviour of those around you.  I don't think you'll like</i><br>
<i>&gt;the comments you will receive.</i><br>
<p>
    While this has the ring of validity to it, most situational <br>
responses to an individual's attire are more of an Ameobic response than <br>
a reasoned one. (5% think, 5% think they think, and 90% wouldn't think <br>
if you tied them up and tried to force them to). Most individuals, <br>
(extropians definitely excluded) are Xenophobic, and react to anything <br>
outside of their perceived "normality" with hostility. If you think <br>
wearing an anti-religious T-shirt will cause you to be shunned by the <br>
majority of knee-jerk society, try dying your skin a deep lush purple <br>
and going out for a night on the town. It's not religion or the lack <br>
thereof that these people are seeking to destroy, it's nonconformity. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;All I ask of religionists is to leave me alone and stop using their </i><br>
<i>&gt;beliefs to legislate my life.  If you think none do, then you haven't &gt; </i><br>
read the papers lately.  (Sen. Nickles statement that Mr. Hormel is <br>
<i>&gt;unfit to represent the US as an Ambassador because, and only because, </i><br>
<i>&gt;he is a homosexual. That ought to scare the bejabbers out of anyone </i><br>
<i>&gt;with half a mind.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thanks all, Cori</i><br>

   I believe the quote goes "God... Save me from some of your followers"<br>
<p>
                               Thanks,<br>
