Spoilers for the movie below.<br>

<p>
This was one of several aspects of the move that detracted from the <br>
overall effect.  The "things are falling apart" aspect was overplayed, <br>
especially with the severely localized rainstorm that hit Truman while he <br>
was on the beach.  Still, these were relatively minor quibbles.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The filmmakers brought out this theme in the latter half of the movie by</i><br>
<i>&gt; casting it as a classical epic, in which Truman battles against a</i><br>
<i>&gt; manipulative god who would rather kill his creation than lose his control</i><br>
<i>&gt; over it.  Truman survives a terrible storm and thinks that his escape is</i><br>
<i>&gt; complete---and then his boat literally runs into the end of the world.  Now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; please understand--I don't generally have big emotional reactions to movies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; most are too calculated for my taste.  But when Truman stands against that</i><br>
<i>&gt; wall and realizes the true enormity of what he faces, and he throws himself</i><br>
<i>&gt; against that well, trying to physically will himself through it to</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom--well, I just lost it and had to go see the movie again in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see the full ending!</i><br>
<p>
I also found that scene to be exceptionally moving. He remained <br>
weird, goofy Truman ("that is one strange cat, my man"), while <br>
demonstrating tremendous dignity and strength of will to continue on, <br>
even after crashing into the end of the world.  The part was played in <br>
character, but what a character!  "Who are you?... Then who am I?". Each <br>
line and action at that point had a grace and dignity about it <br>
that was true to Truman's own character, especially vis a vis the opening <br>
scene and several of the scenes with Marlon; self-awareness, coupled with <br>
a sense of humour.<br>
<p>
One other aspect of the movie that I found especially interesting <br>
was Cristof's position with respect to his creation.  It seems that <br>
similar ethical problems will be faced by any creator of an <br>
artificial intelligence.<br>
<p>
Is it ethical to contain an AI in a limited world? This is an especially <br>
interesting question if one takes the point of view that the most likely <br>
path to Artificial Intelligence is an approach based on evolutionary <br>
programming.<br>
<p>
Is it ethical to broadcast details of an AI's "life" to other <br>
researchers or interested parties?<br>
<p>
Is it ethical to profit from the actions of an AI?<br>
<p>
None of these questions is new, however I found that they were made <br>
especially vivid by the movie.  I'm not sure of any of the answers.  I <br>
have an instinctive revulsion against Cristof's position, but I can imagine <br>
giving a qualified "yes" as the answer to all of the above questions, <br>
under some circumstances.<br>
