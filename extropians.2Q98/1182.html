You last statement is debatable.  I'm currently working on a paper (which I'll<br>
present later on completion), which discusses the distinct possibility of<br>
creating collaborative transhuman networks capable of insulating/immunizing<br>
themselves against possible malign super-AI long enough to develop and aquire<br>
access to nanotechnology that is sufficient to upload and/or enhance our<br>
neural-nets to compete on a level playing field with said AI's.  (boy, that was<br>
a mouthful!).<br>
