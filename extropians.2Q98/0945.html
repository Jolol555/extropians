<i>        &gt;What is their alternative? [to government handouts]  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Private charity might be enough, of course I can't guarantee it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Sounds to me like anarcho-capitalists don't give a damn about the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;poor ~80% of the world!  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I can find no evidence that rabid anarcho-capitalists such as myself have <br>
less compassion then socialists, we just realize we're dealing with human <br>
beings not Euclidean Geometry so proofs are not available. I refuse to give <br>
guarantees on social issues, politicians are quick to give such assurances <br>
because it makes voters happy, but if one respects the truth it must be said <br>
that in any system that sort of certainty is impossible.<br>
                                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I have always liked the idea of a minimum guaranteed income </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Me too, I'd love to have one, unfortunately it's impossible. Government can't <br>
guarantee such a thing, at least not honestly, because to do so they would <br>
have to guarantee that they will always continue to be successful in their <br>
ability to extort money of any amount from anyone anytime they need it, and  <br>
also guarantee that future politicians will always want to make handouts to <br>
the weak. Both assumptions are very questionable and in fact almost certainly <br>
wrong.                           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;is their any anracho-capitalist who can demonstrate how the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;free-market can support and sustain a wide-spread liesure-class         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;society </i><br>
<p>
No, not with any certainty. If there is a wide-spread liesure-class that is <br>
unable or unwilling to support itself then obviously it will have to be <br>
supported by the non wide-spread non liesure-class. If the productive class <br>
is compassionate and willing to do this then the non productive class will <br>
have no problem, and if they aren't then they will. The productive class is <br>
the powerful class and no government can stay in power if they do things the <br>
most powerful class doesn't like, not even if the weakest class is crazy <br>
about the government. This has nothing to do with morality, it's nobody's <br>
fault, it's just a fact of nature.<br>
                                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If your conclusion is that we must all continue to work in some form         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;or another, then I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!</i><br>
                                 <br>
<p>
My conclusion is to work or beg for a handout. What is your alternative?<br>
