"Relative Bioavailability of Coenzyme Q10 Formulations in Human Subjects"<br>
<p>
Summary:<br>
<p>
    The relative bioavailability of typical commercially available forms of<br>
coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was compared with that of Q-Gel, a new solubilized<br>
form of CoQ10, in human subjects in two separate trials. In the first,<br>
standard softgel capsules containing CoQ10 suspension in oil, powder-filled<br>
hardshell capsules and powder-based tablets were tested along with Q-Gel<br>
using a daily dosage of 120 mg for three weeks. The baseline plasma CoQ10<br>
values were all very tight (0.50-0.52 microgram/mililiter) and after three<br>
weeks the values were 1.37, 163 and 1.60 microgram/mililiter for the first<br>
three products and 3.31 micrograms/mililter for Q-Gel. The relative<br>
bioavailability calculated using the areas under the plasma CoQ10 curve<br>
(AUC) were (microgram/mililterXtime in days) 7.16 (100%), 8.97(125%),<br>
9.19(128%) and for Q-Gel 22.86(319%). The second trial, carried out to<br>
replicate the findings in the first, employed only two groups, namely the<br>
standard softgel capsules containing the suspension and Q-Gel, and the<br>
duration was extended to four weeks. Plasma CoQ10 values were: baseline<br>
0.40 and 0.38 and after four weeks 1.26 and 2.80; the corresponding AUCs<br>
were: 8.33 (100%) and 22.75 (273%). Thus the data from both the trials show<br>
that Q-Gel, the new solubilized form of CoQ10, is vastly superior to<br>
typical commercially available preparations of CoQ10. This means much lower<br>
doses of Q-Gel will be required to rapidly reach and maintain adequate<br>
blood CoQ10 values than with any of the other currently available products.<br>
<p>
Note: Q-Gel is a proprietary formula (patent pending) containing CoQ10 in a<br>
blend of sorbitan monooleate, polysorbate 80, medium chain triglycerides,<br>
propylene glycol, d-alpha tocopherol and PVP (Pasdone).<br>
