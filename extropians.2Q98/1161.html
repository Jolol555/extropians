<i>&gt;Again, I'm not so sure that they would</i><br>
just ignore rights altogether.<br>
<i>&gt;They'd surely reject the idea of rights</i><br>
as an inviolable moral code, but as<br>
<i>&gt;to whether they would respect them</i><br>
anyway?  That's another issue entirely.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
"respect them anyway?"  Hmmm.... Having<br>
rejected the notion of rights (by which<br>
we might mean the "just and proper" --<br>
or at least customary -- claims or<br>
entitlements that people invent to<br>
protect their property or activities),<br>
it seems to this brain (the one typing<br>
this) that in reality "rights" means<br>
whatever an entity can get away with.<br>
Correlating to the concept of "Manifest<br>
Destiny" which gave Europeans the<br>
"right" to take possession of an already<br>
inhabited continent, one might foresee<br>
that an even craftier machine<br>
intelligence might come up with some<br>
brilliant reasoning to justify<br>
exterminating a major portion of the<br>
human population who present an<br>
inconvenience by their existence. No<br>
doubt a few humans (not to mention the<br>
UnGreat Satan Saddam Hussein) have<br>
entertained the same kind of<br>
justification for exterminating masses<br>
of humans. But mass murderers of the<br>
human kind haven't yet had enough<br>
intelligence to figure out how to do it.<br>
<p>
Bottom line: We can find plenty of<br>
reason to fear malevolent<br>
super-intelligence, but malevolent<br>
ordinary intelligence may wipe us out<br>
first.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
