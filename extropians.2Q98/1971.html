Abstract<br>
  STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine adult<br>
  body height as an indicator of general<br>
  health. DESIGN: The study was a survey of a randomly selected sample of the<br>
  adult Swedish population obtained by the Swedish National Central Bureau of<br>
  Statistics. PARTICIPANTS: The sample studied was identified in 1980-81 and<br>
  comprised 14,757 persons aged 16-74. Of these, 12,695 (86%) consented to<br>
  interview. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Information was obtained on adult<br>
  height, socioeconomic status in childhood and adult life,<br>
  self perceived health, self reported longstanding illness, and<br>
  mortality during a six year follow up. The numbers of people<br>
  in three height groups who considered their general health<br>
  as bad, who reported any longstanding illness or who died during the follow<br>
  up were compared with the expected numbers in the same groups. The number of<br>
  persons with reduced health and the number of deaths was larger than expected<br>
  in the shortest height group. The excess risk of dying in<br>
  the shortest group (about 20% higher compared to the tallest group) was<br>
  reduced but not eliminated when present and childhood socioeconomic group was<br>
  taken into account. Coronary heart disease mortality in<br>
  particular was linked to height. The shortest group of men<br>
  and women reported the largest proportion with bad general health and<br>
  longstanding illness. For the latter the differences between<br>
  height groups disappeared after controlling for present<br>
  socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: There is a detectable excess risk of<br>
  morbidity and mortality from being short. Assuming that the<br>
  childhood environment is an important determinant of adult stature it is also<br>
  important for adult health.<br>
