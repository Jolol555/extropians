In a message dated 98-06-26 17:17:02 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  On of the tenets of deism/theism is that god<br>
 created the natural laws of the universe, and stood back from there.  To<br>
 interfer with those laws once they had started running would be to destroy<br>
the<br>
 independence of that creation. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
AH.  Now I'm learning things.  :-)  I don't want to beat this thread to death,<br>
( I know, we already have.) so I won't continue the line unless you'd like to<br>
discuss it further via personal mail.  I'd probably learn more, so that'd be<br>
fine with me.  This idea, that god created, then stepped back to observe, is<br>
not one I've really heard much about.  I'd certainly be interested in anyone<br>
elses thoughts on this aspect. <br>
And if you've more to add, by all means drop me a personal line.  <br>
<p>
Thanks for your thoughts, Cori<br>
