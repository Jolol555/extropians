Yes, however using electromagnetically actuated cylinders along the route to<br>
evacuate ahead of the projectile and pump right behind the projectile will help<br>
alleviate this by a goodly amount. Using this method, you not only reduce drag,<br>
but you use it to generate thrust. Another measure would be to use ionization<br>
effects to minimize shock wave formation along the boundary between the projectile<br>
and the tube wall.<br>
<p>
Of course, any tube system IMHO is not economically cost effective unless you have<br>
a really high population density along the corridor being served, with large<br>
population centers at each end.  While Japan might be a good place to develop<br>
these, the US doesn't currently have the need, as there is still plenty of air<br>
capacity to be used, especially with decentralized GPS navigation beign phased in.<br>
<p>
Mass transit, at this point in time and in the near future is not a cost effective<br>
investment of resources.  Current mass transit projects here in the US average an<br>
investment of $300,000.00-750,000.00 per new mass transit system user. They are<br>
subsidized by large numbers of people who live very far from the systems and never<br>
or rarely use them, or even need them.  In comparison, any public agency can<br>
reduce transit/highway system use (thus reducing pollution, energy consumption,<br>
and road traffic) by investing in home workstations and training for unemployed<br>
people who are dislocated by economic shifts, often for less than $10,000 per<br>
person. Mass transit requires the construction of very dense communities at<br>
selected stations to be of any use for large areas on long routes (a long route is<br>
the only situation where an vacuum tube system would be of any use.) The trend in<br>
the US here is in less dense communities...<br>
<p>
The Seattle Rail Transit system proposed several years ago, for example, proposed<br>
spending $9 billion to increase mass transit ridership by a mere 34,000 people.<br>
In the same time period, they projected that as much as 8 percent of the total<br>
workforce in the area would shift to telecommuting at a cost to the taxpayer of<br>
$0.00.   Hmmmmm, which is the more useful thing to promote???<br>
