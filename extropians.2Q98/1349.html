I think that's very probably true, it's certainly my working assumption.                        <br>

Yes, if consciousness is unrelated to intelligence then the conclusion is <br>
unavoidable, human zombies exist, in fact with only one exception genetic <br>
drift could have turned all humans into zombies by now. There is no evidence <br>
that this has happened, there is no evidence that it has not.     <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;consciousness provided to the animals with it (in varying degrees).          </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Sometimes I wonder, are animals less conscious that we are? Are smart people <br>
more conscious than stupid people? When I was 7 years old I was not as <br>
intelligent as I am now (I think) but I was just as conscious (I think). <br>
It's true that I don't remember being conscious when I was 7 months old and I <br>
was even dumber then, but that must just be due to a malfunction in my memory<br>
because I don't remember anything, not just being conscious, when I was that <br>
age. Also, consciousness must be related to emotion as well as intelligence <br>
and most of the emotional parts of our brain are very old and quite similar <br>
to those found in animal brains.<br>
<p>
Time for my pet theory, I suspect that consciousness is ancient, easy to  <br>
produced and requires only a tiny amount of intelligence. High level <br>
intelligence on the other hand is much newer in the history of life because <br>
it's harder to make. If so then the real challenge is not to make a machine <br>
conscious but to make one intelligent. Remember it's just a theory.<br>

<p>
                      <br>
If I was writing anyplace else I might be a little more careful in using <br>
anthropomorphic words when talking about evolution, but it's a useful <br>
shorthand and I really don't believe any Extropian thought I approved of <br>
teleology when interpreting nature.<br>

Well, actually it does. Gravity doesn't bother to make things fall up. (:&gt;) <br>
