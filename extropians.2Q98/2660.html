&lt;&lt;These may not be things you consider evil,<br>
but I certainly consider any god that would sit by and permit such,  to be<br>
evil, ruthless, and sadistic.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Any God that prevents such actions only ensures that his creations exist in<br>
the "My Little Pony" universe or something similar.  You insist that you be<br>
free to tread your own path, yet you castigate a God, who, by letting everyone<br>
else do so as well, allows evil into the universe. If he's going to let you<br>
live as you see fit, then he's going to have to do the same thing with<br>
everyone else.  Or do you, like the Rev. Robertson, insist that whatever God<br>
does to "other people" is just fine, and what they deserve?  He wants God is<br>
going to iwipe out Orlando with a hurricane, you want God to limit my freedom<br>
of action so that he can fit into your definition of what is acceptable.<br>
<p>
Face it, all this talk of not beleiving in a God who allows "horrible<br>
diseases, accidents and the like."  is so much sophomoric posturing that<br>
allows you to live in a solipsistic universe where only your actions have<br>
meaning or impact.  Everything that doesn't fit into your world view or your<br>
morals is dismissed, allowing you to feel quite superior to a God whom you<br>
assure yourself doesn't exist anyway. The nice thing about the "light of<br>
reason" is that if you truly adhere to it, is that you can NEVER assure<br>
yourself that anything is impossible.  Anytime you do so you've exchange the<br>
"cold light of reason" for the warm, blissful confines of ignorance.<br>
