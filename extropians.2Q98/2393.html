<i>&gt;c) keep in mind that the Bible as we know it is only a small part</i><br>
<i>&gt;of all of thebiographical texts, and that the two gospels which</i><br>
<i>&gt;were actually written by actual disciples of Jesus were left out</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the Bible because they weren't conducive to a stern autocratic</i><br>
<i>&gt;Church. The four gospels that are in the Bible were written 70-150</i><br>
<i>&gt;years after the death of Jesus, and are thus open to significant</i><br>
<i>&gt;debate as to whether the quotes attributed to Jesus are actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;what he said. The Gospel of Thomas, and the Gospel of Mary</i><br>
<i>&gt;Magdalene can be found in the Nag Hammadi, along with a number of</i><br>
<i>&gt;other texts which paint a much different picture of Jesus.</i><br>
<p>
Very well put, it's ironic that this subject came up again just as<br>
I'm re-reading Pagel's "The Gnostic Gospels".<br>
<p>
I've always been amazed that the average church-goer knows little<br>
to nothing about the origin's of christianity. The study of early<br>
christianity, by the way, is known as "Patristics".<br>
<p>
It's my opinion that it's not taught by practicing religions<br>
because it would cause difficulties if your average christian for<br>
example, ever found out that the doctrine is almost literally word<br>
for word taken from Zoroastrianism, or of the break immediately<br>
after Jesus's death, between the supporters of Peter, (later to<br>
become the Catholic church) and those of Mary Magdelene and Jesus's<br>
brother James (remember him) which became the Gnostic's. (later<br>
hunted to near extinction by the orthodox.)<br>
<p>
Bonus question: After the betrayal and suicide of Judas Iscariot,<br>
the disciples picked a new member to complete the 12, what was his<br>
name?<br>
