I'm off to pursue new and better things and will no longer have time<br>
to participate in this list, so I bid you all a tearful goodbye.  But<br>
before I go I'd just like to thank you all for using your brilliant<br>
ideas to shape me into the hideous monster I am today.  There was once<br>
a thread on this list that went something like, "when was the last<br>
time an Extropian post changed your life."  And I'd have to say that<br>
from the day I joined (just two years ago) to present day you have all<br>
succeeded in challenging and changing (for the better?) everything<br>
that defines me.<br>
<p>
I'd especially like to thank:<br>
<p>
Max More - the first time I heard about Extropy was when I saw you on<br>
television (talking about longevity with Natasha I think).  So I'd<br>
especially like to thank you for using a ridiculously easy to remember<br>
name, it makes web searches less tedious.  Oh!  And there's that<br>
little thing of starting all this in the first place!<br>
<p>
Natasha Vita More - the search for "Max More" returned your web site<br>
instead.  So my first exposure to Extropian thought was through your<br>
writing and your art.  Can't think of a better way myself.<br>
<p>
John K. Clark - for brilliantly rebutting every counter claim I could<br>
make against anarcho-capitalism and uploading.  The former changed my<br>
thinking forever, and now I'm a rich and ruthless man.  The latter<br>
just gave me a headache.<br>
<p>
And there's a whole bunch of others who have contributed more subtle<br>
changes to my thinking (Anders, Damien, Lee Daniel, et al).  So thank<br>
you all too.<br>
<p>
And if I ever said anything to offend any of you (who me?) I really,<br>
really, really didn't mean it and I'm very, very, very sorry.<br>
<p>
Good bye, and good luck to you all!<br>
<p>
