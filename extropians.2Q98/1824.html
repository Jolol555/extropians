<p>
I disagree.  Information is completely immaterial.  Conisder:  I am a<br>
novelist who has written a book.  I have taken energy, ink and paper and<br>
turned them into a draft.  If I submit this draft to my publisher, he<br>
could publish it.  Obviously, I have added value to the ink, paper and<br>
energy by writing my novel.  (Let's imagine for a moment that my novel is<br>
good.  :) )<br>
<p>
However, if I gave YOU the same ink, paper and energy and told you to<br>
write my novel, you couldn't do it.  You probably couldn't even do it if I<br>
gave you TWICE as much energy.  Why?  Because you would not know what my<br>
novel says or is about: you would not have the information.<br>
<p>
The fact that given ample matter and ample energy you could not generate<br>
my information means that it is a very different process from widget<br>
making, which economics presumes CAN be done by anyone with enough labor<br>
and capital.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A service is work, a kinetic, not a static state. Information is static like any other</i><br>
<i>&gt; product. Transmitting information is doing work as it is a kinetic action, expending</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy to do work, so the act of transmission is a service, and the act of agreeing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; lend someone the use of my information for specific purposes on the condition that you do</i><br>
<i>&gt; not reproduce my information to sell to others is also a service. The information which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is lent is still a product.</i><br>
<p>
Information is also unlike a product in that, unless I forget about it, I<br>
can never return it to you, nor have you lost your use of it while I<br>
borrow it.  Whether or not you agree that this is a service rather than a <br>
product, I think you must admit that this an attribute which is unique<br>
to information; I argue that it is because of this unique property that we<br>
should not enforce property rights over it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Moreover, service, or work, is the ultimate property right, unless you beleive in</i><br>
<i>&gt; slavery. Only a slave does not have sole right to his or her own labor. An individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot have his or her work stolen from them. Intellectual property rights protect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; product of that work, whether it is a statue, a song, a building, a machine, or anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; else which is the result of man applying his or her intelligence to add value to</i><br>
<i>&gt; something.</i><br>
<p>
Go back and reread, and then consider my coercion point a little more<br>
carefully.  Suppose there are no property rights, and I am deciding<br>
whether or not I am going to invent.  I know that if I invent, many people<br>
besides me will benefit.  Suppose that I decide to do so anyway, FULLY<br>
AWARE of the fact that others will benefit.  Since this action is<br>
voluntary, and not coerced, then the benefit which others would take from<br>
my action as an externality is not stolen, but willingly given; if I was<br>
unwilling to give it, then I would not have done so, and refused to<br>
invent.<br>
<p>
Now, this externality is still bad, because it means that I do not have<br>
enough of an incentive to invent as I otherwise should.  I ACKOWLEDGED<br>
that in my last post:  this was the "deadweight loss as inventors produce<br>
fewer inventions than they otherwise would."  I argued that this<br>
deadweight loss would be OUTWEIGHED by the economic efficiency gained from<br>
not enforcing those rights.  Let's examine this more carefully.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I understand your logic, and beleive that you are wrong in your economic evaluation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Without a protect of an inventors intellectual property rights, there will not be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same level of invention as there is when there are such protections. The human race is</i><br>
<i>&gt; desperately dependent on advancing technology from invention that is stimulated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property rights incentives, only because we are stuck on one planet with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever increasing population. Every increase demands greater efficiency of resource</i><br>
<i>&gt; utilization, something which can only happen with high levels of invention. You have</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignored the incentive effect that such protections have on technological development.</i><br>
<p>
I did NOT ignore it; I specifically referred to it, and argued that it<br>
would be outweighed by the deadweight loss due to monopoly plus the cost<br>
of enforcement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Exactly, which is why your concept cannot work and maintain a decent level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological advancement.</i><br>
<p>
Wrong.  The fact that transaction costs are not zero means that the system<br>
of allocation of resources is inefficient; this is represented by<br>
deadweight loss.  However, enforcing intellectual property is ALSO<br>
inefficent, as it grants monopolies over copes of ideas, resulting in more<br>
deadweight losses, as well as incurring the cost of enforcement.<br>
<p>
The question is not which system is inefficient and which is not; the<br>
question is which is LEAST inefficient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Intellectual property enforcement  costs are extremely low, because it is very easy for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the public to know when a product is a knock off or not.</i><br>
<p>
If each buying person gains equal utility from a copy as they do from the<br>
original (an extremely likely presumption when we're talking about pure<br>
information) then it becomes profitable to buy your goods from the black<br>
market rather than from reputable dealers.  And if you think the black<br>
market for information is easy to break, the software industry has NEWS<br>
for you.<br>
<p>
Even today, software copyrights simply aren't enforced on a wide scale; to<br>
do so would require monitoring everyone's personal computers and<br>
wire-tapping the whole Internet; it's completely impossible to<br>
discover/prevent if the pirates are using encryption for anonymity and<br>
transmission.  You'd have to outlaw cryptography in order to even come<br>
close to eliminating software piracy.<br>
<p>
Software piracy is probably the highest costing market upon which to<br>
enforce intellectual property; music probably comes in a close second<br>
(it's a black market which is unevenly enforced so you can't get official<br>
numbers for this sort of thing).  However, even if the cost due to<br>
enforcement is lower for some goods than for others (your mailing list,<br>
perhaps), you STILL have the problem of deadweight loss due to<br>
monopolization of copies.  Basically, I'm covered by BOTH effects: the<br>
cost of enforcement AND monopolization.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Granted they have gone up in</i><br>
<i>&gt; recent years, but only because we have opened our economy wide to the Chinese, who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; no respect for intellectual property, nor any other type of property or individuality, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems. Rather than looking at pirating as a positive externality, look at the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement as an externality created by pirates that everyone has to pay. If trade with</i><br>
<i>&gt; pirate economies were cut off, our cost of intellectual property enforcement would go</i><br>
<i>&gt; down again.</i><br>
<p>
Your logic is dizzying: the more the positive externality happens, (which<br>
this is, by definition,) the more we have to pay to stop it from<br>
happening!  Of course, if we weren't trying to pay for IP's enforcement,<br>
then we would circumvent that part of the problem entirely. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You have to date, only guessed. Since the current situation is one where intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; property is respected and enforced, I think that the onus is on YOU to prove your point</i><br>
<i>&gt; with real numbers. Until you do, all we can think of your ideas is that they are quaint</i><br>
<i>&gt; fantasy with no basis in fact.</i><br>
<p>
Guessing?  Only so as to provide extra precision.  If you'd like I can<br>
stick to being very general, based on what we already know.  We already<br>
know that the cost to an individual of producing another copy of a piece<br>
of information is low, and that it does not increase significantly when<br>
lots of people are producing lots and lots of copies.  Therefore, we know<br>
that the production of copies is nearly completely elastic.  (HOW near is<br>
what I was trying to guess.)  Since the marginal revenue curve for<br>
monopolies is half of the demand curve, we know that it will strike the<br>
P=0 line at 0.5Q, where Q is the quantity demanded when P=0.  If the<br>
marginal cost curve were completely elastic, then the market for copies<br>
would shrink by 50% thanks to monopolization.  Again, since it is only<br>
nearly completely elastic, deadweight loss is is only nearly 50%; I<br>
guessed 40%, which gives me a large margin for error.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think that history shows that lack of intellectual property enforcement causes</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention to be severely undervalued. Looking at how national borders create natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; limitations on intellectual property rights, and how making such rights enforceable</i><br>
<i>&gt; across borders via tools such as GATT it seems rather clear that prior to enforced</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property rights, invention was severly undervalued, and the rates of</i><br>
<i>&gt; productivity growth suffered as a result. Today's startling increases in  productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a few years after GATT are proof that expanding the incentive to invent expands the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rate of invention and therefore the rate of productive growth</i><br>
<p>
Oh, there's no question that the rate is affected. I agree: when the<br>
incentive goes up, invention goes up, and when incentive goes down,<br>
invention goes down.  That's not what I'm on about.  What I'm saying is<br>
this:  we know both that the market for copies is slashed by at least 40%<br>
when IP is enforced, and that the cost of enforcement is non-trivial.  Is<br>
monopolization's deadweight loss plus the cost of enforcement GREATER than<br>
or LESS than the deadweight loss due to decreased invention?  I say<br>
greater; you know why. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Considering that you have refused to respond to my refutation of your assertion that an</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention is a monopoly, your argument does not stand. Any engineer will tell you that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are always many many ways to solve a problem. Only problems are unique. Invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not a monopoly market.</i><br>
<p>
We must assume that the engineer's ability to route aroun IP is not a<br>
significant effect, otherwise IP has NO economic effect at all: whenever<br>
you try to patent your idea, I invent another one just like it and you<br>
gain nothing.  If this is true, then the only difference in costs between<br>
enforcing IP and not enforcing IP is the cost of enforcement; and that's<br>
in MY favor, not yours.<br>
<p>
However, if we assume that IP cannot be so easily routed around, as we<br>
must if we think IP will have any effect, then we must observe that IP is,<br>
by its very definition, granting the inventor monopoly rights over copies<br>
of their idea.  This is how we define IP; there isn't any argument to be<br>
made here.  And, since in this market copies are cheap and supply is<br>
elastic, the market for copies suffers at least 40% losses thanks to<br>
monopolization.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't need to. The present economy is my own proof. YOU need to come up with proof that</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic growth would be higher without such protections. That the US has one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; highest levels of intellectual property protections, along with among the top 3 or 4 per</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital incomes/standards of living, and among the highest economic and productivity</i><br>
<i>&gt; growth rates for a nation at its state of development (a third world with a 50% growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; rate doesn't mean anything if they are starting from nothing.)</i><br>
<p>
I'm making a MICROecnomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument.  As you<br>
well know, there are hundreds of thousands of effects which have positive<br>
and negative effects on the economy, many of which are present in the US<br>
and not in other areas (or vice versa).  The only macroecnomic argument<br>
which I can present is that microeconomic efficiency, as a trend, leads<br>
towards greater GDP.  However, the behavior of one market can never be<br>
used to predict the behavior of the economy as a whole.  Microeconomic<br>
markets tend to clear and/or equilibrate; they have no business cycle.<br>
The macroeconomy is practically the antithesis of this model.<br>
<p>
If I am right, then IP is just one of the galaxy of factors which hold<br>
America back from greater growth, none of which alone could possibly<br>
explain our growth rate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, theft is when someone benefits from someone else without that persons permission or</i><br>
<i>&gt; acquiescence.</i><br>
<p>
If there are no IP rights, and the inventor invents despite knowing this,<br>
then the inventor has, by necessity, acquiesced.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To fail to protect the product of an individuals mind is to declare that</i><br>
<i>&gt; all minds are slaves to society, that the individual has no rights at all. That is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; collevtivist, subjectivist, post modern scam if ever I heard one.</i><br>
<p>
Well, how does this sound:  I declare that individuals have a right to<br>
their physical property and energy, and that anyone has the right to<br>
organize their property in any way they want, even if they organize their<br>
property just like someone else's property.<br>
<p>
Doesn't sound very collectivist to ME.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Fails to maximize the utility of what or who?? Society? Sorry, society has no rights, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not entitled to its own utility. Lack of intellectual property is enslavement of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind to the collective. Bye Bye BORG.</i><br>
<p>
What striking rhetoric.  No, not the utility of society, but of all of the<br>
individuals in society, in sum.  Just like how America's wealth is not the<br>
wealth owned by America, but the wealth owned by every individual in<br>
America (and that's the way it should be!), I refer to net utility as the<br>
utility possessed by every person in the nation. <br>
<p>
See?  Not collectivist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hardly. As history has shown intellectual property works (American history). Lack thereof</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not work (most everywhere else's history)</i><br>
<p>
Whether IP works or doesn't work is the subject of debate; it cannot be<br>
demonstrated by looking at GDP, as many nations which DO have IP are<br>
nonetheless doing poorly macroeconomically; the behavior of one market<br>
does not dictate the success of the whole.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are you utilitarian or libertarian. There is a distinct difference.</i><br>
<p>
My ethical principles are utilitarian.  Because of that, I certify that I<br>
do not believe in or advocate the initiation of force as a means of<br>
achieving political or social goals.  You decide whether that makes me a<br>
libertarian or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You have yet to objectively and scientifically demonstrate that it is a bad law. The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; dead weight here are those who steal the product of another's mind.</i><br>
<p>
Monopolization objectively leads to deadweight loss.  I have argued that<br>
the law is bad for this reason.  Now it's time for you to show how the<br>
deadweight loss under my system is bigger than the deadweight loss under<br>
your system as well plus the cost of enforcement.<br>
<p>
By the way, would you consider increasing the margins on your mailer?<br>
