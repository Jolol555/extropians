  IAN: As I clearly stated, I posted <br>
  a review of what I read and requested <br>
  to see counter arguments before making <br>
  up my mind. I think it unwise to fail <br>
  to cite for review and consideration <br>
  any purported threat to liberty. As <br>
  is then most often the case, such <br>
  claims with respect to technology<br>
  turn out to be totally illogical<br>
  and thus serve as evidence of the<br>
  pro-liberty reality of technology.<br>
<p>
  Setting a precedent of Govt control <br>
  of technology should always be seen<br>
  as an explicit threat to liberty, and<br>
  most relevant to Extropians, so it's <br>
  wise that issues related to this be<br>
  raised and carefully considered. <br>

<i>&gt;The granting of a patent does not grant the right to produce something,</i><br>
<i>&gt;merely the right to prevent others from producing it for 20 years.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;collectively we ban such a gene's sale, the patent holder has no right to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sell it. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: But even after 20 years you cannot grow<br>
  from dead seeds. It's not that seed companies<br>
  owe you seeds that will yield a crop next year,<br>
  it's that if such seeds eventually dominate the<br>
  market, there could be undesirable repercussions.<br>
<p>
  It all centers around monopoly. So long as there <br>
  are a wide variety of options available, the event<br>
  of universal mono-genetic "seed killing" crops and<br>
  subsequent dependence upon 1 company is less likely.<br>
<p>
  This issue does touch upon examples pertaining to <br>
  the anarco-libertarian case against patent monopoly.<br>
  Also the value of private initiatives to warehouse<br>
  seeds of all varieties of crops. If non-TT genes<br>
  cannot be wiped out, the market could be there<br>
  to bring them back when and if TT turns bad.<br>
<p>
  The wise "marketeer" might go out and start <br>
  building his own seed bank for the future.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;As to such a gene "escaping" into other crops....  If a gene makes a life</i><br>
<i>&gt;form's descendants LESS likely to reproduce that gene, then the gene tends</i><br>
<i>&gt;to die out in the evolutionary competition.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: This occurred to me, and as such, that the <br>
  gene could be self-eliminating in the gene pool.<br>
  But constant cross pollination from neighboring <br>
  farms could (?) wreak havoc on farms that rely <br>
  upon seeds for next years crop. If true, I'd <br>
  define that as a property violation, not un-<br>
  like a nuclear power plant being next door.<br>
