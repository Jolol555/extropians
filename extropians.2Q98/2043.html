<p>
&lt;disclaimer&gt; I do not know enough quantum to say very much about it;<br>
anything I do say may be wrong.  Please be polite when you correct me.<br>
&lt;/disclaimer&gt;<br>
<p>
However, I do know enough about light to say that the energy of light is<br>
NOT given by mc^2. This is the rest energy of particles which HAVE mass; <br>
photons don't.  The REAL relativistic equation is actually E^2 = p^2*c^2 +<br>
m^2*c^4, where p here is the momentum, given by (g)^2*m^2*v^2 for normal<br>
particles, where (g) is given by 1/(1 - v^2/c^2)^0.5.  Plug the equation<br>
for momentum into the relativistic equation and you get E^2 = (g)^2*m^2*<br>
v^2*c^2 + m^2*c^4.  Factor this and you can get E^2 = (g)^2*m^2*c^2*(v^2 +<br>
c^2).  For very small velocities, v^2 + c^2 ~= c^2 and (g) ~= 1.  So we<br>
get E^2 = m^2*c^4, or E = m*c^2.<br>
<p>
Obviously, the approximations we make for the rest energy of slow moving<br>
particles is completely wrong; for light, which has no mass, the second<br>
term of the first equation drops off altogether, and we get E^2 = p^2*c^2,<br>
or E = p/c.  The energy on a photon is given by h*f where f is the<br>
frequency, so we can get f = p/h/c.  Using the definition of wavelength<br>
that x = c/f, we get x = h*c^2/p. <br>
<p>
We run up against a similar problem, however, when we do try to identify<br>
the frequency (though very different from the one which you had originally<br>
posited in your first post).  h and c are indeed constants, so the more<br>
precisely you know a particle's wavelength the less precisely you know its<br>
position.  Many people have taken the uncertainty principle to be saying<br>
that were we to know the precise location of a photon, it would exist<br>
EVERYWHERE; while this is often a useful way to think about it, this is<br>
not strictly correct.  A photon whose wavelength is known perfectly may be<br>
said to exist *anywhere* in the entire universe; a photon whose position<br>
is known perfectly must be said to have *any* frequency.<br>
<p>
Does this contradict the idea of Tarskian truth statements?  Not<br>
necessarily.  Again, a large part of the reason who we have Heisenberg's<br>
uncertainty principle is because particles move about in an apparently<br>
random way, bounded by certain probability functions (which are themselves<br>
very specific and well-defined).  So if we know the particle to exist at<br>
precisely one location, its momentum will be completely *random*.  By<br>
definition, no equation can predict the completely random; we cannot<br>
therefore state, a priori, what that momentum will be.<br>
<p>
Does that mean that the blueness of a particle whose position is known<br>
perfectly is in an "ambiguous" state of blueness?  No, it means that the<br>
particle is in a *random* state of blueness.  If you want to find out<br>
perfectly if it's blue or not, you'll have to measure its momentum<br>
perfectly, at which point it will have a perfectly random location.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The question is not the truth value at points well within boundries. It </i><br>
<i>&gt; is what truth value to prescribe exactly at the border.  I will not try </i><br>
<i>&gt; to extend the analogy to your macroscopic example,as feet are not point </i><br>
<i>&gt; particles and will overlap the border.  Photons, when well behaving, are </i><br>
<i>&gt; point particles and do not cause this sort of confusion.</i><br>
<p>
What truth value to prescribe precisely at the border will be given by the<br>
proper definition; for example, if blue happens when the wavelength is<br>
greater than or equal to 450, then not blue is anything less than 450.  If<br>
a particle's position is known precisely, it will have a random blueness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        The gist of my argument is that when attempting to map all </i><br>
<i>&gt; statements (in a metalanguage) onto the world, wherever boundries are </i><br>
<i>&gt; drawn there will be fundamentally unavoidable ambiguities.  At some </i><br>
<i>&gt; point (in this case at the points of 540 and 560 nm), it will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible to give a truth value of either true or false.  I suppose if </i><br>
<i>&gt; you insist on maintaining the Tarskian diagram, you could say "le laser </i><br>
<i>&gt; est bleu' is Truly True or False, but I don't think this is what Tarsky </i><br>
<i>&gt; had in mind! If you find multivalence truly abhorrent, I find no </i><br>
<i>&gt; objection to making a Tarskian diagram with three Truth values, True, </i><br>
<i>&gt; False, and Ambiguous (or Not Applicable).  However, as I pointed out </i><br>
<i>&gt; above, the uncertainty principle would make Ambiguous the correct Truth </i><br>
<i>&gt; value at every point (each photon may or may not be blue). While </i><br>
<i>&gt; accurate, it doesn't do much good to anybody.</i><br>
<p>
Not ambiguous, UNCERTAIN.  That's why they don't call it the ambiguity<br>
principle and why they DO call it the uncertainty principle.  And despite<br>
the fact that the blueness will be completely random, it WILL be either<br>
blue or not blue, despite the fact that we cannot measure which while we<br>
know the position perfectly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You could get around the problem of Ambiguity by redefining blue in </i><br>
<i>&gt; terms of complex numbers, but your new defintion would not bear any </i><br>
<i>&gt; relation to what anybody else thought of as blue.</i><br>
<p>
I presume you are alluding to the Shroedinger equation, by which you would<br>
say that something was blue if the probability function of its momentum<br>
fell within certain well-defined boundaries.  Interestingly enough, you<br>
are right about the fact that it would not bear any relation to what we<br>
call blue, but not because it involved complex numbers.<br>
<p>
The easiest way to explain this is with something like the Gaussian<br>
distribution, better known as the bell curve.  Suppose for a moment that<br>
you had a probability function which looked like the bell curve.  Its<br>
width at the points of inflection would be the standard error (which is<br>
actually the value which is used in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). <br>
Using it, we are accustomed to saying that a particle's position, momentum<br>
or whatever is given by the position of the absolute maximum value on this<br>
graph, +/- the standard error.  490 +/- 5 nm, for example.<br>
<p>
However, look at the bell curve again.  It is not bounded by these points;<br>
rather &gt; 80% of its area falls within these boundaries; there is a small<br>
chance that the particle, as described above, should have a wavelength of<br>
400nm, an even smaller chance that it should have a wavelength of 600nm,<br>
and a remote but non-zero probability that it should be 2nm.  If we were<br>
to say that a particle was blue if its probability function met certain<br>
well-defined criterion, then we would have to say that the above random<br>
particles would be blue, despite the fact that their wavelength would<br>
agree much more with purple or even red.  We'd still call it blue,<br>
however, because the probability of it having a wavelength that small or<br>
that large was small.  In other words, an unlikely red is blue. <br>
<p>
We don't need complex numbers for this, since the probability function is<br>
actually the square of the Schroedinger function (which is the one with<br>
the complex numbers), but it DOES give us some pretty non-intutive<br>
results.  For that reason, I'm perfectly fine with saying that red is<br>
bounded by particular wavelengths, rather than particular probabilities,<br>
and that sometimes the redness of a light is truly random. <br>
