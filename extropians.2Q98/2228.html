How about this for a safeguard against NodeMaster abuse: two equal<br>
NodeMasters for each list. Less workload for each individual nodemaster,<br>
redundancy in case one of them goes on vacation or has a problem with net<br>
access, and a lower chance that both of them will try to make an<br>
irrational decision about the same thing. <br>
<p>
By the way, Max, you mentioned the logistics of charging for access to<br>
NodeNet for non Exi members as a concern. How about this as a pricing<br>
strategy:<br>
<p>
1. Anyone can read the lists for free, but to search the list<br>
archives they have to have membership?<br>
<p>
2 Have the subscription be free for a couple of months, until demand<br>
starts to grow, and then start charging.<br>
<p>
3. Have read-only access be free, but read-write access carry a fee,<br>
except for those invited? (I conceed that this might not be such a good<br>
idea)<br>
<p>
4. I don't know what your internet access is like, but perhaps breaking<br>
into the ISP business? Many ISPs provide access first and content as an<br>
afterthought, but here we'd be selling them content and access as equal<br>
parts of the same package. This is probably the most difficult and risky<br>
of the ideas, but if we can get it to work...<br>
