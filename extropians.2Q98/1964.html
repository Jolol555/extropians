<i>&gt;Oops!  Why "supposed" gigantic size?  You keep saying that you're not</i><br>
leading this thread anywhere, but then you also keep slipping in clues<br>
that you really don't believe in dinosaurs.  You seem to already have<br>
decided that dinosaurs never really existed.<br>
<p>
I don't "beleive" in "beleive"...I try to make judgements based on evidence.<br>
And my statement regarding what I thought I knew regarding elephants in regard<br>
to their strength weight ratio cast all larger land animals (unseen...deduced<br>
from fossil evidence) in doubt.  Might there be an alternative explanation?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  You seem to already have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  decided that dinosaurs never really existed.</i><br>
<p>
Actually...no.<br>
<p>
But in the interest of precesion in speech...since "words mean things"...and<br>
imprecise speech leads to imprecise thinking...<br>

Title of thread...ment to acquire the attention of the "reader"...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  - Dinosaur "Hypothosis"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  - Dinosaur "Theory"</i><br>
<p>
Is that not correct?  Are you ABSOLUTELY certain...beyond ANY shadow of a<br>
doubt...that our current idea of dinosaurs is correct?  Or to put it another<br>
way...show me a dinosaur...if you can't...it's a theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  - fossils aren't bones</i><br>
<p>
are they?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  - "Is T-Rex possible...?"</i><br>
<p>
is this not a valid question?....dragons used to be deemed possible...and sea<br>
serpents..why...astounding as it might appear in this enlightened age...honest<br>
politicians were once thought to exist....does it hurt to question basic<br>
assumptions?<br>
