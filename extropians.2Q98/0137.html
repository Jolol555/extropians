I want to apologize to Anton Sherwood for calling<br>
him a crackpot, even though he initiated the term<br>
against me. I think that the problem is simply one <br>
of misunderstanding, and I think that to a large<br>
degree (the largest degree) the burden of that <br>
problem rests on MY shoulders. If someone does<br>
not understand what I say, and if, as in the <br>
case of Anton, they are an intelligent person,<br>
then I'm willing to and need to accept that this <br>
is most likely because I have failed to properly<br>
articulate and fully define what I'm saying.<br>
<p>
If something is true, it tends to be immediately<br>
self-evidence, and understanding tends to fall <br>
in line rather quickly. There are big parts of<br>
what I'm saying that do fall in line (we cannot<br>
show where A is A free from not-A, thus not-A<br>
must be part of the identity structure of A, yet<br>
atomist tradition rejects such inclusion), but <br>
there are also parts that contradict tradition,<br>
which may mean I've yet to master my inquiry.<br>
<p>
Well I'm well on the way!<br>
<p>
What I have on my "drawing board" now is simply<br>
fantastic! It abolishes the contradictory inter-<br>
face between holism and atomism, and in so doing<br>
embraces the atomist statement A=A and defines <br>
a new category, or identity strata in which the<br>
inverse statement exists. It covers all bases!<br>
<p>
When Anton said I need a new term other than <br>
"identity," he was mapping just that out...yet <br>
it's not a new term, it's a new strata/level.<br>
There is +A and -A, but also (absolute)A. The <br>
whole identity of A defines/implies 3 things:<br>
inside of A, outside of A, AND their logical <br>
union -- that's just a surface skimming.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that whenever we find a con-<br>
tradiction, our problem is an effort to insert <br>
two poles into one hole, or one pole into two<br>
holes, and the only solution is to find another <br>
hole or pole to establish a one-to-one mapping. <br>
<p>
Paradoxes and contradictions are important signals, <br>
and what they tell us is that either we are wrong,<br>
or there is a hidden duality at work that we've<br>
overlooked. The A/-A identity analysis is an <br>
effort to map the "duality nature" of identity,<br>
a reality that has been overlooked, proven by <br>
the fact that the A=A paradigm contradicts<br>
physical fact in which A is A relative to -A, <br>
and "relative to" implies "is inclusive of."<br>
<p>
I'm sorry Anton that I was so counter-attack <br>
oriented. You've said good things about me,<br>
and even stood up for me after the CNN thing,<br>
and for that I'm grateful, even as in so doing <br>
you tend to reduce my inquiries to something less <br>
than mature. Since taking on the TWA 800 inquiry <br>
and "wrong" theory promotion, I've been under more<br>
personal assault that I could have ever imagined<br>
my life would encounter, direct personal assault <br>
from all levels of society, even Fed-Heads openly <br>
curing my name live on the air! The weight of this<br>
is nearly catastrophic to my psyche, and is a major<br>
reason why I tried to "escape" with an apology only <br>
to be set-up and shot down by the GovtMedia again. <br>
<p>
Think about it, scan the Net, there are gazillion <br>
conspiracy theories out there positing all manor <br>
of evil onto to Govt, but little 'ol me, I'm the <br>
one who has been repeated taken to the woodshed<br>
by the GovtMedia. Why? Look at my work, with every<br>
factoid included carefully referenced, it may be<br>
the most responsible theory-promoting rumor-free <br>
research you'll find anywhere. I'm attacked NOT <br>
because I'm telling lies (as all the attacks<br>
portray me as doing), no, I've been attacked <br>
only because I'M WINNING THE ARGUMENT!!!!!<br>
<p>
It's only too clear to see for anyone who takes <br>
the time to look. The major media is uniformly<br>
pro-Govt. They will not research anything that <br>
would conclude that the Govt killed 230 people<br>
and then acted to cover-up that truth. In fact,<br>
they'll go out of their way to step on anyone <br>
who does investigate such a grim possibility.<br>
<p>
There is no evidence that supports any other <br>
theory but the missile theory, that's a fact!<br>
The spontaneous-center-fuel-tank combustion <br>
theory is totally devoid of evidence, it is <br>
a definitionally "crackpot theory." Its only <br>
desirable feature is it absolves the Govt.<br>
<p>
OK, enough already....<br>
