Joe, Ev has been on this list for a long while. As far as I know, he's<br>
always raised interesting questions and has always been extremely good<br>
at dialogue and discussion, as opposed to rancor, rehetoric, and<br>
name-calling. (I suspect from his background that he can be extremely<br>
effective at name-calling if he chooses to be.)<br>
He does not try to put words into other people's mouths<br>
and then riducule those words. He has an interesting and pragmatic<br>
point of view and is generally a solid reasoner. When he asks a<br>
question, it's usually a good one. This question, concerning<br>
allometry as applied to dinosaurs, is in fact valid. In general,<br>
It is counterproductive to denigrate someone's post if you don't<br>
understand what the person meant by the question. It just upsets<br>
everybody without actually contributing to the discussion. A better<br>
approach is to ask for a clarification. <br>
<p>
I assumed that Ev is asking whether or not we actually know the<br>
microstructure of dinosaur bones.<br>
