<p>
This is an old misconception stemming from the time when accurate<br>
chemical analysis was not available.  In the early days, nutrients were<br>
detected by their biological activity in culture, and not by their<br>
chemical composition.  Thus, different sources of a nutrient were<br>
compared, even though they were different substances.<br>
<p>
"Natural" vitamin A was actually beta-carotene, which is virtually<br>
nontoxic.  "Synthetic" vitamin A was actually retinol which is toxic in<br>
high amounts.  The "natural" version was obviously superior to the<br>
"synthetic" version, but only because it was a different chemical<br>
substance.<br>
<p>
"Natural" water contains healthful minerals, whereas "synthetic" water<br>
(distilled water) lacks these.  Obviously, "synthetic" water did not<br>
include the mineral nutrients.  Obviously, differring ingredients are<br>
being compared.<br>
<p>
"Natural" vitamin D3 is nontoxic and occurs in small amounts in foods. <br>
"Synthetic" vitamin D2 is made by irradiating milk.  This form of<br>
vitamin D can be toxic in high amounts.  Again, different chemicals are<br>
being compared.<br>
<p>
"Natural" vitamin C contains bioflavinoids and many cofactors that help<br>
the nutrient, and also is often acid-buffered in foods.  "Synthetic"<br>
vitamin C is pure ascorbic acid, which lacks the other nutrients, and<br>
often its acidity can cause gastric distress.  Of course, different<br>
chemical forms act differently.<br>
<p>
Many times when people refer to "natural" versus "synthetic", they are<br>
not comparing the same chemical substances.  Often, they are comparing<br>
different forms.  The "natural" forms often have various foods,<br>
cofactors, pH buffering, that provide different affects than is found<br>
with a single, pure nutrient.  All chemical function is based on<br>
chemical content.  The same substance will always act the same,<br>
regardless of its source.  Differing substances or mixtures will act<br>
differently, each according to its ingredient list.<br>
