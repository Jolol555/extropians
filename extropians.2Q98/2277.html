This is not in itself an argument against the Nodes. It is an argument<br>
against a total failure to market and manage the Nodes effectively.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A maillist is a network. When</i><br>
<i>&gt;splitting up a maillist into nodes or interrestgroups the value of these</i><br>

<p>
If the ability to interrelate the specialized Nodes is retained through<br>
appropraite browing privileges and cross-posting then this is not a valid<br>
argument.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Naturally the noise level of the big node will probably be bigger than</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the many seperate nodes. Therefore a node will only increase in value</i><br>
<i>&gt;until a certain point. I am pretty shure that the Exi list is so far</i><br>
<i>&gt;from this point that it will be a bad idea to split it up.</i><br>
<p>
The ExI list will never reach this point as it stands, because it's<br>
structure is not attractive to the sort of specialist who can actually<br>
bring about Extropian ideals. The concept of Nodes is intended to be<br>
attractive to such people. Nodes do not replace this list, they serve to<br>
augment it by a marketing strategy with an appropriately specialist-facing<br>
twist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I spend my working time building comunities in intranets and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet. My experience is that a LOT of people has to use something</i><br>
<i>&gt;like a maillist for it to be of any interrest. If not... interrest</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply fades away. This could easily happen for Exi.</i><br>
<p>
Equally, interest fades where discussion does not translate in to action.<br>
ExI should not be an observer, it should be a creator. Nodes may well allow<br>
ExI to become such a creator.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The main reason for the succes of the net, I think, is that it gives</i><br>
<i>&gt;everybody the ability to reach out and touch anybody they want to.</i><br>
<p>
The specialist who would be attracted to the Nodes would not want to be<br>
touched by just anybody. Being open to everyone is not everybody's idea of<br>
networking Nirvana.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exi list gives us the abillity to discuss with the "leaders" in</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism and extropy, and by participating long enough, to maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;become one of the leaders ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
The Nodes would give the leaders something to lead.<br>
