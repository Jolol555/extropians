‚` FRussell's paradox "Set M which does not contain itself" is the third<br>
valued proposition which is neither true nor false.<br>
<p>
If set M which does not contain itself contain[s] itself, set M is not set<br>
M. If set M which does not contain itself does not contain itself, then set<br>
M is set M. So If set M contains M, set M is not element of set M, and then<br>
if set M does not contain M, set M is element of set M. This means that Set<br>
M is composed of two dual implications between contradictory propositions. <br>
<p>
Let p= "M is not element of M".If not p, then p, and, if p, then not p.<br>
then p Ìnot p. <br>
<p>
Because this set M is contradictory to the true statement and the false<br>
statement, and has to be expressed by a dual implication between two<br>
contradictory statements, this set M is assigned the third truth value<br>
which is contradictory to "the true" or "the false". There might not be<br>
comprehensible proposition as an example of the proposition with the third<br>
truth value any further.<br>
<p>
The third truth value is, at times, assigned to a possible proposition, and<br>
at times, assigned to a recurrent propositions, and at times, assigned to a<br>
moral proposition which has the political contents, and above all, assigned<br>
to a paradoxical propositions. And, such a phenomenon overflows in the<br>
world. The third truth value represents these paradoxical or reflexive or<br>
recurrent or possible propositions which contain itself anywhere or<br>
anything in it's propositions. <br>
<p>
Let p a possible proposition, p depend on q which is something immature or<br>
future, but something q depend on a possible proposition p. <br>
Now, let {p=p(q)} p depend on q, then p=p(q) and q=q(p). So,<br>
p=p(q(p(q.......... . <br>
Let q=-p. Then, p=p(-p(p(-p(p(-p...... . <br>
This is the symbolic expression of a possible proposition p and its dual<br>
implication.<br>
<p>
The statement of this symbolic expression are a possible proposition or a<br>
recurrent proposition or a future proposition or moral proposition, etc. So<br>
this type of proposition is natural events in our life. <br>
<p>
Note: Denial of this third valued proposition <br>
<p>
As these third valued propositions exist certainly, the denial of the third<br>
valued proposition becomes logical problem. So this four valued logic<br>
assumes this negative form of the third truth value to the fourth truth<br>
value. Then, this four valued logic is able to have the law of<br>
contradiction or excluded middles like 2-valued logic. This is the reason<br>
that this logic is said the simplest expansion of 2-valued logic.<br>
