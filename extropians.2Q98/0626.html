   IAN: Interesting ideas. Does Sasha have a page on this?<br>
   I think that many central religious concepts are simply<br>
   (usually poorly defined) expressions of real truths that<br>
   are what they are independent of the religious contexts <br>
   we have come to associate them with. The tendency of the<br>
   scientific community is the write off the whole set of<br>
   religious ideology as "superstitious nonsense." But I <br>
   think to do that is a great mistake. Ancient religious <br>
   traditions are full of diamonds in the rough just waiting<br>
   to be rediscovered polished off for a new generation.<br>
<p>
   The principles of fuzzy logic are an example of this:<br>
   what most saw as the epitome of mystical nonsense and <br>
   double talk, once carefully mapped, turned out to be<br>
   not only logical, but opened the door to great advances<br>
   in logic and its application to real-world problems.<br>
<p>
   The process of redefining ancient wisdom has two effects:<br>
   (1) it shows that the mystics weren't spouting pure non-<br>
   sense, and in this way adds weight to the mystical tradi-<br>
   tions, and yet it also (2) demystifies the mystical and <br>
   in this way sort-of pulls the rug out from under mystical<br>
   traditions. A truth properly defined tends to lose its<br>
   mystique, its power over us. What we cannot or have not <br>
   properly defined tends to belittle us, overwhelm us, <br>
   make us surrender to some "higher mystical power."<br>
<p>
   There are some really weird UFO cults out there. They'd<br>
   fall apart overnight if aliens were proven to be true<br>
   and came to Earth and integrated into Earth societies.<br>
   It's the mystery that fosters religious/magical thinking.<br>
   Science is the process of demystifying the mystical when<br>
   possible, not necessarily exclusively of disproving it.<br>
<p>
   Even as I claim to have verified the mystical experience,<br>
   I believe that the process of properly defining what those<br>
   mystics were talking about is a process of dismantling <br>
   religion even as one shows that some of it was valid.<br>
