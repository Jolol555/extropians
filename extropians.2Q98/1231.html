Though not a contributor, I personally have been getting a great deal<br>
out of the polymath list archives at <br>
<a href="http://mars2.caltech.edu/polymath/date.html">http://mars2.caltech.edu/polymath/date.html</a><br>
<p>
If not *big* names, there are certainly some intellectual heavyweights<br>
running about there. Not to mention that a considerable number of<br>
list-members are, or appear to be, transhumanists. <br>
<p>
The list is invite-only, and the quality of discussion (in my outsider's<br>
view) ranges from usually superb to sometimes inbred, but it's one of<br>
the best lists I've come across as far as the 'important' issues are<br>
concerned.<br>
<p>
Don't forget that Damien Sullivan also runs his Filtered Extropians<br>
list. It's a great service, sometimes you miss some context, but if it's<br>
high s/n you want, these are acceptable losses.<br>
<p>
Point is, there are options (and as D. Broderick has suggested, a good<br>
filter to C:/CRAP is always one of them &lt;g&gt;)<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; I'm quite dismayed by the number of</i><br>

<i>&gt; I agree.  Frankly I find you all terribly boring and hold many of you</i><br>
<i>&gt; in utter contempt.  But now and again among the S/N ratio moans, posts</i><br>
<i>&gt; about grammatical errors and authors promoting new books, there's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; brightly shinning gem.  And it's those ideas I'd like to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; encouraged.  Luckily most of the good ideas come from a few main</i><br>
<i>&gt; sources (some of which aren't me!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So is anyone interesting in setting up an invitation-only list?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Choosing new list members would be the job of those already chosen by</i><br>
<i>&gt; whomever wants to organise it.  Maybe a web site could be set up for</i><br>
<i>&gt; viewing (after the list member's controversial ramblings have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; edited for public consumption) or an edited digest version sent out to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the less fortunate non-members.  We could also invite some "big names"</i><br>
<i>&gt; in science, technology, art and (even) politics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would get an invitation for having the idea, of course.</i><br>
