<p>

<p>
<i>&gt; So failure to support property rights is qualified failure to support </i><br>

<i>&gt; slavery.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   I was referring primarily to rights WRT physical property.<br>
  <br>
  Self-ownership seems at first sight a promising basis for (some) <br>
property rights;  I quite like the idea!  Alas, it has its problems.<br>
<p>
I don't know how 'self-ownership' can be made to work without some kind of <br>
methodological dualism (a 'self' to own the body).  I have no problem with <br>
methodological dualism -- I'm an interactionist dualist; but I notice <br>
quite a few people hereabouts who are monists -- they believe the self is <br>
identified with the atoms and molecules of the physical being.<br>
<p>
Even if we go with dualism, it is far from clear how an infant acquires <br>
self-ownership from its parents -- who provided the initial and necessary <br>
material basis for the new person in the form of sperm and ovum.   Are we <br>
to say that the person is wholly owned by their biological parents unless <br>
or until some form of manumission takes place).<br>
<p>
Then there's the problem of title to ingested resources as the person <br>
grows -- does this give another whose (claimed) resources are consumed a <br>
literal right to their 'pound of flesh'?<br>
<p>
There is a real problem with ingesting living organisms (or  their  body <br>
parts) -- do they not also enjoy degrees of self-ownership?<br>

Warrl continues:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Property rights to raw natural resources (inc. land) can be </i><br>
<i>&gt; developed from the pragmatic need to enforce property rights in other </i><br>
<i>&gt; things; from concern about the environment; from considerations of </i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiency.  In fact we observe worldwide that natural resources </i><br>
<i>&gt; which are unowned (not the property of any particular person) in </i><br>
<i>&gt; their natural state are abused, overexploited, and threatened, </i><br>
<i>&gt; except in those cases where by government decree they are </i><br>
<i>&gt; underutilized, and then usually neglected; those which are owned and </i><br>
<i>&gt; thoroughly under the control of the owner, are comparatively *much* </i><br>
<i>&gt; better cared for.</i><br>
<p>
   Sure!  Many different (and often incompatible) schemas of property <br>
   rights can be developed on a pragmatic basis, as a means to improved <br>
   living standards etc.  I have no problem with that.  But that's not <br>
   what I'm arguing against. <br>
   <br>
   I'm providing counterarguments to the assertion that there are are <br>
   Absolute or a priori property rights which can be used as the <br>
   primary foundation for an entire human society.  No such Utopia has <br>
   ever been proposed in which anyone but a madman would want to live; and <br>
   there is certainly no working example of such a society for us to <br>
   cross-compare with other alternatives.<br>
   <br>
   What's the practical _structural_ difference between (say) Galt's Gulch <br>
   and Saudi Arabia?  One person asserts ownership of the territory and <br>
   their word is absolute law for the inhabitants _simply by reason of <br>
   that ownership_.<br>
<p>
   Are we to enjoy a fine future in our feudal past?  &gt;:-}<br>
