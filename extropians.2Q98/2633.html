&lt;&lt;What would be the point in creating us, period?  What need has an omnipotent<br>
being for a purposely flawed being?  This god person created people with<br>
freewill and also with the ability and capacity for acts of nearly<br>
unimaginable cruelty.  For what possible reason? One experiments when one does<br>
not know what the result will be.  This god is omniscient. He has no need to<br>
experiment, no doubt as to what will happen.  Yet he creates these beings and<br>
sets them spinning anyway?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
There's lots of theoretical reasons why God would undertake to create an<br>
imperfect being. Perhaps he's lonely, and wants someone to talk to.  So it<br>
takes a few thousand millenia for us to get to the point where we can<br>
converse.  So what?  He's god, he's got the time.  Then theres the idea that<br>
if we were perfect, we wouldn't have an existence apart from God, since he's<br>
is by all accounts perfect.  Perhaps he creates for the sheer joy of creation,<br>
and has done millions of times in the universe. We just happen to have been<br>
one of the earlier, cruder artistic efforts.  Then, of course there is the<br>
Cop-out answer, which is that the Mind of God is ineffable, especially to<br>
imperfect beings such as ourselves.  I don't prefer that one, personally, but<br>
I can understand it's appeal.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;This seems to me a rather depressing idea.  I prefer to believe in myself.<br>
In<br>
my own ability, imagination, adaptability.  Rather than sit around wondering<br>
what the "purpose" is to existence, i prefer to live it.  To discover the<br>
answers and the questions for myself.  If the price to be paid for the<br>
supposed comfort offered by a "better life in the hereafter" is the fear and<br>
ignorance demanded by the religionists, i'll pass. <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I feel that my own particular purpose is to provide a bad example for<br>
impressionable children.  :)  seriously though, I don't see how any rational<br>
being would want an answer like that simply handed to them, assuming that such<br>
an answer even exists.  I will attempt to pull myself up by my own bootstraps,<br>
thank you, and will succeed or fail on my own.<br>
