I think the problem with this line of reasoning is that it assumes such ExI<br>
ordination mysteriously bequeaths on the member a high signal/noise output<br>
capacity.  Although Extropy magazine has been a stable of good reading for me<br>
over the past 8 years, the last issue (#17) came out more than a year ago.  Lets<br>
face it, this list *is* where the action is.  Besides, as extropians and the<br>
'Extropy Online' attest, we embrace the online world and all the that implies.<br>
<p>
I thought this thread was started to address the issue of spam not S/N in<br>
particular.  If we restrict postings to those who are subscribe to the list,<br>
this would be adequate in stopping the spam.  Otherwise if the Institute is<br>
looking for some extra money, then perhaps we could go back to the way it was 3<br>
years ago, when we paid $14.95 per year to subscribe to the list.  I suspect<br>
there are many others who would rather pay a reasonable fee to participate in<br>
this online community than pitch in the extra cash it requires to become members<br>
of ExI.<br>
<p>
Anyone else out there feel this way?<br>
