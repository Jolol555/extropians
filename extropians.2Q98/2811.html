In a message dated 98-06-28 13:48:22 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I think all Clinton's assets should be foreited up front.  According to<br>
 several reports, it seems that his money was earned primarily by abusing<br>
 government power.  Starr should just seize all his assets and leave it up to<br>
 Clinton to see if he can get them back!  That ought to get some attention to<br>
 the Civil Forfeiture tyranny in which we live! &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
In a word. Yikes!!<br>
guilty huh?..until he proves himself innocent?.. In that case, you and me and<br>
Michael and just about anyone else you ever heard of is a goner...  <br>
I think the guy is a liar, and probably a criminal. I sure as hell hope nobody<br>
strings him up on an opinion!  <br>
I think I'd be more afraid to live in your State than this one....<br>
