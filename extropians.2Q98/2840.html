<i>        &gt;it's true that people don't require much knowledge at all as they go        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;about their daily tasks.</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
I strongly disagree. People need a huge amount of knowledge to live, even <br>
though most of it is hard to put into words, that's why it's been so <br>
difficult to program an intelligent machine, it's definitions that are not <br>
vital. Maybe definitions are handy in simple minded stuff like chess or <br>
mathematics or formal logic, but not in profoundly intellectual astronomically <br>
complex things like cleaning a house.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We could get along quite well with a series of true beliefs         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;(acquired, luckily, through false methods) </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
I've heard a wonderful story about this but I haven't checked so it may be  <br>
apocryphal, no matter it's still a good story. On November 7 1918 several <br>
newspapers in Boston ran a erroneous story that the First World War had ended, <br>
on the same day two men set sail in a small boat. They arrived in Bermuda on<br>
November 12 1918 certain that the war was  over. They had perfectly <br>
respectable evidence, copies of the newspapers, and their belief was even <br>
true (the war ended on Nov. 11) but was it knowledge?  I'm not sure it <br>
matters what it was because the war was definitely  over and their belief was <br>
true.                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;or simply with a series of beliefs that are practical in the sense         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that we can use them to manipulate the world but false in the sense         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that they don't accurately represent the world.</i><br>
                           <br>
<p>
Making predictions and manipulating the world is the most we can hope for, <br>
nobody has seen deep reality. Our brain just reacts to the electro-chemical <br>
signals from nerves connected to a transducer called an eye. Our computers  <br>
react to the electronic signals from wires connected to a transducer called  <br>
an TV camera. <br>
<p>
Our brain uses theories to explain these signals, so would intelligent  <br>
computers. Theories explain how some sense sensations relate to other sense <br>
sensations. For example we receive information from our eyes,  we interpret <br>
that information as a rock moving at high speed and heading toward a large <br>
plate glass window, we invent a theory that predicts that very soon we will <br>
receive another sensation, this time from our ears, that we will describe as <br>
the sound of breaking glass. Soon our prediction is confirmed so the theory <br>
is successful, but we should remember that the sound of broken glass is not<br>
broken glass, the look of broken glass is not broken glass, the feel of <br>
broken glass is not broken glass. What "IS" broken glass? It must have stable <br>
properties of some sort or I wouldn't be able to identify it as a "thing",  <br>
I don't know what those ultimate stable properties are, but I know what they<br>
are not, they are not sense sensations.  I have no idea what glass "IS". <br>
The sad truth is, I can point to "things" but I don't know what a thing "IS"  <br>
and I 'm not even sure that I  know what "IS" is, and an intelligent computer <br>
would be in exactly the same boat I am.             <br>
                           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;For those interested in acquiring knowledge, however, the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;definitions of concepts are extremely relevant.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Definitions should be consistent and are useful when communicating ideas with <br>
other people but when it comes down to it, they're just words about words <br>
that are defined by still more words and round and round we go. Examples are <br>
far more important.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The principle that we'll never discover anything more fundamental         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;than information is only true if everything IS information. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Give me an example, I don't care how wild or exotic, of a way to prove that <br>
there is something more fundamental than information.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think that it is more accurate to say that everything could         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;PROVIDE information, while not everything IS information.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But nothing can provide anything but information.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;As far as skeptical challenges go, like the one you mentioned         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;although I confess that I've never heard of it, I think that they         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;can be explained away. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You are not a brain in a skull as you'd assumed you are a brain in a vat. <br>
The day after you were born your brain was removed and placed in a artificial <br>
nutriment bath. You have no sense organs but the parts of your brain that  <br>
would have received information from them now receive input from a vast <br>
digital computer providing you with a virtual reality. <br>
<p>
Actually now you're not even a brain in a vat, on your first birthday the <br>
computer examined one particular neuron in your brain and because it had very <br>
good information on how it operated it used nanotechnology to replace it with <br>
an electronic neuron that behaved externally in exactly the same way,  <br>
the 10,000 other neurons connected to it saw nothing strange. When the  <br>
computer was satisfied that the neuron was working properly and received no <br>
complaint from you that you were no longer you it got to work on another  <br>
neuron and then another. After one year all 10^11 neurons and the 10^14 <br>
synapses that connect them together were replaced with computer parts. <br>
You and the entire universe are just information, a big software program.<br>
<p>
Prove I'm wrong and you've proven there is something more fundamental than <br>
information. But you can't. <br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We often tend to speak of one computer communicating with another,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;or DNA communicating with cells via RNA. But this is all just        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;metaphor. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Metaphor? I seems just about as exact and concrete as things get. The cell <br>
certainly acts like it understands what the nucleotide triplet CAU means, <br>
it does things differently when it receives the message and that's what  <br>
information is supposed to do, we do the same thing. Don't take my word for <br>
it, go to the laboratory and ask the cell what CAU means and it will always <br>
tell you exactly the same thing, histidine<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;One computer no more communicates with another than the lightning        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;communicates with a tree when it cuts it in half.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The effects of lightning are not repeatable, sometimes it blasts the tree in <br>
3 parts, sometimes 4, sometimes it sets the tree on fire, sometimes it does <br>
nothing at all, on the other hand CAU always causes the cell to do the same <br>
thing, add histidine to a protein sequence. There is no evidence lightning <br>
has ever built something complex, there is plenty of evidence that life and<br>
computers have. Also lightning has only one letter and a language needs at <br>
least two, the genetic code has 4.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;To have a language one must have MEANING </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Certainly. If I hand you a message that has meaning to you it will do <br>
something to you, the message CAU means something to the ribosomes in a cell <br>
making a protein and it does something to it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Both instances merely involve cause and effect, without any         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;understanding. </i><br>
<p>
I have nothing against cause and effect, the only alternative is randomness.<br>
                                             <br>
