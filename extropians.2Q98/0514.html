<i>&gt; In a message dated 98-04-17 12:22:35 EDT, you write:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; One thing that is problematical is how to transverse fault lines such as in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  California. Large caverns with articulated guide tubes have been mentioned.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I read about this a few years back, but i don't remember where.</i><br>
<p>
Bad idea.  Given the velocities implied by an underground ballistic <br>
trajectory between distant cities, the alternative to "absolutely <br>
perfect curvature" is "extremely loud bang".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems it would be a lot safer and cheaper, and cooler(to look at) if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; were above ground.  Underground has problems with earthquakes and oceans and</i><br>
<i>&gt; whales in the oceans.  I was just thinking about a transportation device</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar a couple weeks ago, using big strong, cheap plastic tubes (clear tubes</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be really cool, especially if you're going fast (300+)</i><br>
<p>
That is extremely *slow* compared to what is being discussed.<br>
<p>
Consider that the fastest manned military aircraft cannot fly fast <br>
enough to stay directly under a low-orbit satellite, and the <br>
satellite is going much faster than such an aircraft would need to <br>
go; and something down at ground level must go considerably faster <br>
to be considered orbital.  Heck, the main reason for evacuating the <br>
tube is that at that speed, simply running into air would be a <br>
serious problem.<br>
