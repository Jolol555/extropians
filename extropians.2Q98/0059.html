<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
This is untrue.  They may well run out of reserve capital, but so long as<br>
their health and safety is in jeopardy, they will constantly be working to<br>
preserve themselves; they can never be stripped of their human captial<br>
unless killed.  At best, Bill Gates would keep on spending his money on<br>
this FOREVER.<br>
<p>
Also, don't forget that most of his income comes from wise investment<br>
strategies, not just from the software sales.  If he's spending a major<br>
portion of his revenues on surpressing the populace, he will be severely<br>
cutting into the growth of his income.  This decrease in growth would<br>
cumulate over the years, eventually costing him far more than surpressing<br>
the people ever would have been worth to him.  If he continues to persist<br>
anyway, you can be sure that his reserves would dwindle down to nothing<br>
over time.<br>
<p>
And best of all, Bill Gates, being a wise investor if nothing else, KNOWS<br>
this, and therefore would NEVER try such a thing:  he'd much rather invest<br>
in something that will actually pay for itself in the long run than throw<br>
money at such a stupid plan.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Second of</i><br>
<i>&gt;all, even if someone did have to spend all his money (say a lesser god,</i><br>
<i>&gt;like rupert murdoch or ted turner), that is still way too much power to</i><br>
<i>&gt;give to one person.  Most of the psychotic dictators around the world</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't get anywhere near that figure (arguably only three ever made it</i><br>
<i>&gt;there, counting side effects and other stuff)</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I should have made this clearer... if Gates *were* to spend all his<br>
money, he'd be crushed by his competitors in no time flat.  And while Gates<br>
is picking up the pieces of his squandered fortune, the indians will be<br>
hiring a PPA to protect them from people like him in the future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That is if your PPA lets you decide where your money is</i><br>
<i>&gt;going to go.</i><br>
<p>
If it doesn't, YOU DISOBEY THEM, with the support of the other PPA, who<br>
profits by helping you do so.  That's part of the point of this whole system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think the analogy with the nation state is pretty useful.</i><br>
<i>&gt;you could fund another nation, (a la cubans in the US), but only if that</i><br>
<i>&gt;other nation is more powerful than your current one.</i><br>
<p>
The problem with this analogy is that you're still thinking in terms of<br>
nations, where you have to stage an overthrow (ie win a war) in order to<br>
live under a new form of government.<br>
<p>
In the instance of PPAs, on the other hand, even tyrannical ones, we're<br>
presuming that they're actually trying to do a cost-benefit analysis with<br>
respect to what they're doing.  A tyrannical PPA will not simply throw<br>
itself at all other PPAs indiscriminately if its customers decide to look<br>
elsewhere.  That would be economic suicide.  It's simply not worth it to<br>
pursue a "stay with us or suffer the consequences" policy when you're<br>
competing with other PPAs, because war is expensive.  An agressive PPA<br>
simply can't compete with a peaceful non-interventionist one; the agressive<br>
PPA would eventually go out of business, no matter HOW power-hungry they were.<br>
<p>
It comes down to this:  it's worth more to me not to be oppressed than it<br>
is worth to others to oppress me.  No one can maintain for long a policy of<br>
spending money on things which aren't worthwhile to them; such fools will<br>
always go out of business in the long run, so long as other competitors<br>
exist to take up the slack.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And that does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;guarantee that your new PPA won't do the same thing, even though it </i><br>
<i>&gt;might not be to the same degree (again, a la cubans in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the US).</i><br>
<p>
True, you don't have guarantees.  What guarantees do you have now of the<br>
same thing?  As John Clark pointed out, what's stopping the US armed forces<br>
from turning this whole land into a military dictatorship?<br>
<p>
I agree with Clark that anarcho-capitalism will not guarantee freedom,<br>
(nothing will,) but rather that it is the political structure most likely<br>
to uphold it.<br>
