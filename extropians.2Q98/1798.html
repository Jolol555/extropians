relaxation<br>
<p>
You don't have to shave your head, take a vow to celibacy, or change your<br>
religion to practice meditation.  Entrance yourself with sound, something<br>
quiet and subtle that will pull at your attention and fill your senses with<br>
serenity (I like the sound of running water).  Find a position that you can<br>
be in indefinitely without much discomfort or disruption of circulation to<br>
your limbs.  Pay attention to your breathing and establish a comfortable<br>
rhythm.  Empty your mind of the numerous thoughts flying about, and let<br>
your sensory experience engulf your mind.  Tel your muscles to relax.<br>
Focus on your breathing; let it become the only thing you think of.  This<br>
can paradoxically seem both impossible, and the easiest thing you could<br>
possibly do.  Remain focused, lest you fall asleep.  <br>
determination<br>
<p>
intention<br>
<p>
It's easy to stray off the path.  You can prepare yourself by having<br>
directions that will take you from wherever you back to where you need to<br>
be.  For example, if you need to write a research paper, make a list of<br>
things you need to do (locate sources, read sources, extract excerpts,<br>
create outline, formulate thesis, etc.).  Whenever you find yourself doing<br>
something that is not productive (read email, IRC, random WWW browsing,<br>
picking dirt off fingernails, etc.), go over your list of things to do and<br>
put yourself back on track.  Done often enough, this process could become<br>
automatic.<br>
<p>
<p>
awareness<br>
<p>
Concentration requires being in a certain state of consciousness<br>
continuously for the desired amount of time.  Music has a powerful effect<br>
on consciousness.  Listen to any type of music that helps you be in<br>
whatever state you need to be in.  If fast thinking is required, fast music<br>
is appropiate.  If repetitive processes are required, repetitive music is<br>
optimal.  If possible, make a CD or tape of the required music and put it<br>
on an endless loop...<br>
<p>
alertness<br>
<p>
Drugs are cool.  I am, therefore I think.  Caffeine will skyrocket you into<br>
frenzied chaos, but will leave you too scattered to keep your wits.  In<br>
proper amounts, however, it is beneficial.  I thoroughly enjoy a little bit<br>
of chai when I want to be alert.  I am trying out piracetam, finding it<br>
makes me acutely aware of blood flow inside my brain (or the illusion<br>
thereof).  Supplements I recommend:  acetylcholine precursors (phosphatidyl<br>
choline), Vitamins B (all of 'em), C, &amp; E, Gotu Kola, Gingko Biloba, and<br>
DHA (<a href="http://www.bio.com/home/martek/neuromins.html">http://www.bio.com/home/martek/neuromins.html</a>).  Of course, it helps<br>
to have a healthy diet with fruits, vegetables, and grains.  I have heard<br>
great things of Hydergine, and am waiting for mine in the mail.  Ginseng is<br>
great, but it is said that it's best not to waste it on one's youth.<br>
<p>
<p>
determination<br>
<p>
Tell yourself you will never give up, and you will take yourself more<br>
seriously.  I once struggled trying to learn a piano piece for 3 hours<br>
straight.  It was frustrating at first, but it got easier once my brain<br>
realized I meant serious business and was not going to leave the piano for<br>
a few hours.  The temptation of scrapping it all and doing something else<br>
is severe, especially if the task at hand is challenging.  Having infinite<br>
patience is difficult, yet simple if one keeps one's priorities straight.<br>
One of my favorite original quotes:  "The more patience you have, the less<br>
patience you'll need."<br>
<p>
hope this helps,<br>
