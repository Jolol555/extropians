Simple:  when you choose not to extend your life, you choose to die.  When<br>
you are dead, you are unable to pursue your own interests (barring<br>
afterlife presumptions).  Therefore, when you choose to die, you choose to<br>
contradict the rest of your value system, if your life has any use at all<br>
in bringing about that which you value.<br>
<p>
Since I doubt that Hayflick would like it if I offered to kill him, we may<br>
presume that he values his own life or that his life is extrinsically<br>
useful in bringing about that which he DOES value.  Whichever it is, if<br>
immortality is possible then he necessarily contradicts his own value<br>
system by refusing it. <br>
<p>
This may not be true if for some reason his life ceased to be<br>
extrinsically useful in bringing about what he valued.  However, it is<br>
probably false to presume that it never could given lots of time.  So even<br>
this case is not sufficiently strong to endorse suicide.<br>
