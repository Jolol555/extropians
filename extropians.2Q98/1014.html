<i>&gt; between skill value and cost of support would be large enough to be a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant burden on the productive segment of society, far more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; altruism is likely to support.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This transition may not have a "feel good" solution.</i><br>

Finally Ah ah!  Therein lies the rub!  You see, most people in the US at least<br>
have enough money to get by.  So if the economy is increasing in productivity and<br>
efficiency, why then will more and more people become impoverished instead of<br>
becoming better off?  I tell you why, because the means of production and capital<br>
becomE accumulated at the top at the expense of all those at the bottom.  It's<br>
simple mathematics!  Gee, sounds like this is already happening.  NPR announced<br>
the other day that now 94% of US wealth is in the the hands of the top 20% - the<br>
greatest discrepancy in US history. Hmmmmmm...<br>
<p>
***So if I were to take your scenarios seriously, the free-market is nothing more<br>
than a ripe opportunity for the rich to get richer at the expense of the rest of<br>
us.***<br>
<p>
I cannot think of a better argument against free-markets than the one you have<br>
just outlined!! :-)<br>
<p>
If not, then only one conclusion can be drawn - AUTOMATION IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY.<br>
<p>
Boy its fun being a devil's advocate!!<br>
