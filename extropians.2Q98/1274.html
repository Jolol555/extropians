There are a few ideas which have been proposed to provide renumeration<br>
to artists even without government intellectual property (IP) rules like<br>
copyrights and patents.<br>
<p>
One possibility is to enforce IP via contracts.  When you buy a work<br>
of art, the purchase contract obligates you not to sell it.  This is<br>
a voluntary transaction and you are free not to buy the artwork if you<br>
aren't willing to accept this restriction.  But if you do buy it, you<br>
are bound by the terms of the contract not to resell the art.<br>
<p>
The problem with this one is the difficulty of enforcement.  It may happen<br>
that someone "somehow" acquires a copy of the artwork.  Since he has<br>
not signed any contracts, he is free to reproduce it and sell it at will.<br>
Sure, someone must have broken his contract somewhere along the chain<br>
which led to this person selling it, but how can you know who did it?<br>
<p>
One proposed solution is fingerprinting/watermarking.  Each work of<br>
art is made different in some subtle way, and so if one is found being<br>
reproduced then it is possible to know who originally purchased the copy.<br>
They can be held responsible for violating their contract.<br>
<p>
Various cryptographic techniques exist for digital watermarking of digital<br>
goods, but this is an area of ongoing research and it is not clear at<br>
this point whether techniques can be found which prevent thieves from<br>
forging or erasing watermarks.<br>
<p>
It may also be difficult to distinguish between a person who voluntarily<br>
violates his contract, selling the artwork, versus a person who gets<br>
his copy of the art stolen.  In either case it ends up being widely<br>
reproduced.  In the latter case you can still argue that the victim of<br>
the theft was guilty of negligence, but traditionally that would have a<br>
less harsh penalty than someone who intentionally violates his contract.<br>
So it may be difficult to fully recompense the artist once this happens.<br>
<p>
Another idea which has been proposed for selling IP is a "recursive<br>
auction".  I've just seen informal descriptions of this idea so I don't<br>
know how the details are supposed to work.  The general idea is that the<br>
artist initially creates his work of art (a new novel, say), and sells<br>
it for a lot of money to one buyer.  This is the whole compensation to<br>
the artist so it may have to be hundreds of thousands of dollars or more,<br>
for someone who is really successful.<br>
<p>
That first buyer gets to be the first person to read the novel.  But of<br>
course it has cost him a lot of money.  Now he can get it back by selling,<br>
say, just two copies, to two different people.  These people pay about<br>
half as much as the first person, to get the rights to be the 2nd and<br>
3rd people to read it.  This compensates the first person and he ends<br>
up not having paid anything excessive for his special role.  Now, each<br>
of these two people reads the book and then sells it to two more people,<br>
for 1/4 the original purchase price, covering their own costs.<br>
<p>
This carries on recursivelly, each person buying the book and then selling<br>
two copies for half the price he paid.  By the time a few thousand<br>
people are able to read the book, it is selling for practically free,<br>
each person involved has had to pay only a tiny amount, and the artist<br>
got an adequate fee.<br>
<p>
This is obviouslly a simplistic explanation, and as I said I have<br>
not seen any kind of rigorous writeup which might explain whether it<br>
could actually work.  Clearly it would be more suitable for some works<br>
than others.  Items by a famous author for which having one of the first<br>
copies would be truly worthwhile would probably be best suited for the<br>
recursive auction, as would articles with time value, for which getting<br>
the information early is better than getting it late.<br>
