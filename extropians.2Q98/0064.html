Look, if Bill Gates ever develops an insane homicidal hatred of me then  I'd <br>
be in a very uncomfortable situation in my system, yours, or any other. <br>
I think you're trying to hold advocates of Anarchy to an impossibly high <br>
standard, you want us to prove that evil acts would be impossible in such a  <br>
world. Well I can't do that, but I think I can show that there would be more<br>
freedom, far fewer victimless crimes, and no murders committed on an  <br>
industrial scale that we're all too familiar with. Instead of dreaming up <br>
bizarre and unlikely scenarios involving murderous billionaires ask yourself  <br>
how the holocaust or the inquisition could have possibly occurred in the <br>
world I describe.<br>
<p>
By the way, last time I checked there were close to a billion Indians not <br>
10 million<br>
           <br>

<i>        &gt;i don't see any PPA supporting the poor people since they have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nothing to gain from this, apart from forced labor and slavery.</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
If this sort of thing bothers you then pick a PPA that does a lot of charity <br>
work. Of course if nobody wants to help these people then they're in deep <br>
trouble, but no worse than today. If you won't voluntarily help the poor why <br>
would you vote for a politician who makes you?<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Doing business with a PPA is voluntary as long as that PPA lets it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be a voluntary thing. </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
A nation has a geographical area, so changing nations is nothing you can do  <br>
lightly as it will change every aspect of your life. A PPA on the other hand <br>
has no geographical area, changing a PPA would be like changing your car <br>
insurance, you just pick up a telephone. A PPA that tried to prevent people <br>
from changing would have to go to war with all the other PPA's, for reasons I<br>
explained earlier it's unlikely it would win.<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;people who enjoy making money. Those kind of people are much safer         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;to  have in positions of power.        </i><br>
                 <br>
<i>        &gt;i would say that is exactly the kind of people that are in a        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;position of power right now. How many dictators are poor after their         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;time in  government?</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
It's meaningless to ask how much money Stalin had, his face was on the <br>
currency for goodness sake, he could have anything and everything that it was <br>
possible for the USSR to produce. Making money is a good and noble activity <br>
and the idea that Bill Gates had more power over peoples lives than Stalin <br>
is crazy.<br>
