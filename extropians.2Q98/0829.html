I recently said there was one thing in _Contact_ that's been on my<br>
mind recently, now thanks to the flurry of responses there's another. <br>
At the end of the film the overall message seems to be that science<br>
and religion don't have to be opponents because they both seek to<br>
attain the same goal - truth.  I think this is wrong and is a<br>
fundamental reason for the religious opposition to science.  Science<br>
does not seek "truth" that is the sole aim of religious groups. <br>
Instead science seeks to develop theory, these theories are judged by<br>
their applications in the real world.  For instance, it doesn't matter<br>
if quantum mechanic's is true or false as long as I can build a<br>
working quantum computer.  I think science needs to make a clearer<br>
distinction between truth and theory, especially in areas that clash<br>
with religious beliefs.  Evolutionary theory has clashed on many<br>
occasions with creationism, I think this is largely due to scientists<br>
wrongly suggesting that creationism is entirely untrue and that<br>
evolutionary theory proves this.  Creationism is not of importance to<br>
science simply because it has no application in it, whereas evolution<br>
has bread artificial life, genetic research, game theory, etc.  This<br>
abundance of applications does not mean evolution is true and<br>
certainly does not mean creationism is false.  But scientists<br>
increasingly "attack" religious beliefs, which means religious groups<br>
have to defend themselves and look at science as an opposing belief<br>
system.<br>
