<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: So there's no difference between false </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; ledge. If what A knows is false and what B knows </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is true, the knowledge of each is equally scientific. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Granted you can look at "true" in the sense of a scientific truth i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt;"this complies with 100% of our observations at present time." But I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was opposing scientific "truth" presented as a competing against</i><br>
<i>&gt;religious truth. The popular definition of "truth" is that which</i><br>
<i>&gt;is unquestionable - clearly this is not scientific. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: It appears that many who fancy the mantle<br>
  of "science" believe that there are truths that <br>
  are not to be questioned, such as the claim that<br>
  "A is A, A is not both A and not-A." Questioning<br>
  that doctrine is a sacrilegious "no no" to many.<br>
<p>
  Just as the church labeled as "heretics" any <br>
  who questioned the church doctrines, these<br>
  people label as "crackpots" anyone who <br>
  questions their central doctrines.<br>
  It's all the same thing. <br>
<p>
  The reliable base of science that transcends the <br>
  mantles various people claim is the testability <br>
  of a claim and the degree to which it adheres to <br>
  physical reality, not the degree to which one set<br>
  of adherents can heap personal abuse on opponents<br>
  (an analysis which is not directed at Yak Wax).<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;... "true" is not an absolute and it's important to be careful </i><br>
<i>&gt;of how you use terms such as "true" and "false" because they are </i><br>
<i>&gt;presumed an absolute by both religious groups and some scientists. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: If there is no absolute truth, then that <br>
  is an absolute truth, therefore there is an <br>
  absolute truth. Therefore, the claim that<br>
  there is no absolute truth must be false.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;So if religion and science have very different ideas about what </i><br>
<i>&gt;is true and what is false, using science to prove religion to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;false is an entirely pointless exercise.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Well, that is different than saying "religion<br>
  is about truth and science about knowledge," for<br>
  that implies that the religious definition of <br>
  "truth" might be false,  and that must be <br>
  determined by some definition of truth,<br>
  which means whatever definition we're<br>
  using, we're calling something "truth."<br>
<p>
  If science has any idea about truth, and if<br>
  science selects some knowledge and discards <br>
  other knowledge, I think that we cannot div-<br>
  orce science and truth in the way you seem<br>
  to have suggested. I believe that science <br>
  discards any knowledge that tests false,<br>
  which means that it does not accurately <br>
  model the physical reality we inhabit.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;When faced with an observational truth (a theory that complies </i><br>
<i>&gt;with 100% of evidence so far) science will still consider alterna-</i><br>
tives (which your definition would consider false)...<br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: That is not true. To claim that science<br>
  is about defining truth does not negate inquiry. <br>
  The very fact that it is about defining truth <br>
  dictates that all truth models be tested.<br>
