<i>&gt; Sometimes I wonder, are animals less conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we are? Are smart people more conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; than stupid people?</i><br>
<p>
I've often wondered if a greater ability to understand complexity<br>
would lead to a different conscious state.  Think about it,<br>
less-intelligent people perceive the world as complex and chaotic,<br>
more intelligent people see the world as slightly less complex and<br>
ordered. Does this have some application in Quantum Mechanics?  If you<br>
are observing events at the smallest possible detail things are in<br>
complete chaos, as that scale becomes increasingly larger things<br>
become more ordered and predictable.  Perhaps consciousness and<br>
intelligence are one and the same, the ability to observe something at<br>
a 'larger' scale makes things more ordered and predictable.  If<br>
however you are less fortunate and your consciousness is below average<br>
the world is a mix of random probability and total chaos.  Of course,<br>
this means the "scale" at which we see things is directly related to<br>
our ability to handle complexity. Remember it's just a theory :-)<br>
