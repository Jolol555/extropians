<i>&gt;&gt; Is the statement "all things are relative" a true statement?  You see how</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; absurd such windage is?  Relativism is incoherent.  If rationality is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wedded to truth then it is clearly irrationality.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Reilly, all phenomenons are relative to the relativity of time and space.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;This relativism is true: In our experience is there only one time -- but  </i><br>
<i>&gt;if we send a atomary watch (A) with a space shuttle around earth and have  </i><br>
<i>&gt;an other similar runing atomary watch (B) on earth than there is a time  </i><br>
<i>&gt;difference between A and B after A has returning from space.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If Einsteins proposal of general theory of relativity is true than every  </i><br>
<i>&gt;watching of phenomenons is relative to the location of the watching human  </i><br>
<i>&gt;in time and space -- and there isn't any sign that Einsteins general the- </i><br>
<i>&gt;ory of relativity is wrong.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not every relativism is incoherent.</i><br>
<p>
I'm coming into this debate late, so I appologize if my topics have already<br>
been covered.<br>
<p>
The argument of relativism vs absolutes is a very slipperey slope.<br>
<p>
First I want to point out that asserting a position of an absolute frequently <br>
leads to a fallacy. (Notice I didn't say "always" because my statement <br>
would then be a paradox; I would be falling for the same fallacy.) (Humor: whenever<br>
anyone starts out by saying "all" or "none" my initial gut reaction is to &lt;in<br>
my best Monty Python/Holy Grail voice&gt;"run away!"&lt;/voice&gt;) :-)<br>
<p>
For example, the statements "all things are deterministic," or "nothing <br>
is deterministic" both fall into that category. Empirical &amp; experimental &amp; experiential observation would<br>
seem to indicate that many things are deterministic (eg classical physics). <br>
Empirical &amp; experimental &amp; experiential observation would also seem to <br>
indicate that there are some things that are not deterministic (eg quantum mechanics). <br>
<p>
Since I utilize the pragmatic viewpoint, it seems to me that the approach to take is simply <br>
"take the approach that produces the results you want." In the example above<br>
this would mean that in some situations a "deterministic perspective" might be<br>
more useful, and in some situations an "indeterministic" one might be more <br>
useful.<br>
<p>
I don't consider myself knowledgable enough about physics (at least<br>
at the current time) to evaluate the merit of relativity in that area. I will<br>
focus on relativity in ethics.<br>
<p>
Going back to my previous point, if you say "all morals are relative" then<br>
you just created a paradoxical conundrum. You would be using an absolute<br>
statement to affirm relativity.  An oxymoron. :-)<br>
 <br>
OTOH, if you accept that there are in fact absolute morals/ethics, then you come<br>
up against the dificult problems of who determines those ethics/morals, and how are <br>
they determined. The historic solution to this problem is to default to some <br>
religious gibberish. However I doubt that many transhumans would find that solution <br>
acceptable (I certainly don't.)<br>
<p>
SOme people accept that these ethics should be determined through democratic<br>
vote. I do not accept this as a solution because you almost always end up with a <br>
minority who is then typically coerced into conformance (the altrernative frequently being<br>
death or imprisonment). Since I believe that non-coercion/non-violence *must*<br>
be a fundamental principle if the human race is to survive and prosper, I do not<br>
accept this as a solution. If OTOH, democratic vote is not backed up by force <br>
than the voting itself  really isn't all that useful and sounds more like my solution<br>
below.<br>
<p>
"Demoacracy is the worst form of 'government' .... accept for all the rest."  <br>
 -- Winston Churchill  (single quotes are mine)<br>
<p>
So my personal conclusion uses a combination of pragmatism and common sense.<br>
I would use the phrase "there are no absolute morals/ethics *that I know of*; each<br>
individual decides for themselves what is ethical/moral. Personally, since I like<br>
pragmatic and anarcho-capitalist ideas (although I don't exactly<br>
like using these or any lables - they are too constrictive), my personal ethics are<br>
"do what works, as long as it doesn't stomp on the rights of others." (I refer to <br>
"rights" in an anarcho-capitalist way - but that is an enitrely differernt topic.)<br>
<p>
However the problem with the no absolute morals/ethics statement is that it leads to <br>
the innevitable "so you believe that anyone can do anything to anyone else - plunder, <br>
murder, rape etc.!!" <br>
<p>
And my answer to that is "no<br>
for practical/pragmatic reasons this ethical relativity needs to be moderated by some<br>
sort of common, agreed upon limits within which trans/post human civilization can<br>
exist (if you accept having plunder, murder, rape etc. you have no civilization - depending<br>
on your definition; my definition of "civilization" doesn't include those things). <br>
<p>
So what is needed is some sort of "working boundaries" from within which <br>
that ethical relativism can exist. This would be sort of a "meta-ethics". Of course you <br>
then run into the same problem again of who determines these "meta-ethics." (See <br>
my reason above for why I do not accept democracy as a method of achieving this.)<br>
<p>
It would seem to me that two logical base-components of such meta-ethics would be non-<br>
violence/non-coercion and a willingness to allow competing ethics/morals and memes to<br>
exist in the "marketplace of ideas". I think a good place to start for these "meta-ethics"<br>
are the "principles of civilization" that are posted somewhere on <br>
<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com">http://www.buildfreedom.com</a> (of course these are just my opinions)  Freedom seems to <br>
be a "lowest common denominator" within which other value systems can exist.<br>
A socialist community could exist as a subset within an "anarcho-capatalist world."<br>
Typically, an anarcho-capatalist community would never be tolerated as a subset<br>
under a socialist/communist/facist regime. There is historical evidence for this. <br>
<p>
There are certain memes that clearly do not permit co-existance with other memes. For example, certain<br>
sects of radical Islamic fundamentalism promote that all people must embrace their<br>
meme. Otherwise they should be killed. This could be considered a type of "killer<br>
meme" - a meme that attempts to not only promote itself, but destroy all others. (And<br>
NO, I don't consider that trait inherent in the definition of a meme.) (So far as I know, the <br>
term 'killer meme' was coined by Howard Bloom in his book "The Lucifer Principle.")<br>
Contrast this with what I wrote above about an open marketplace of memes. Killer <br>
memes are typically very dangerous. Although I don't know what the best way to deal<br>
with them might be.<br>
<p>
Since it is likely that there will always be competing memes, it is also likely that there <br>
will always be competing ethics/morals - relative or not.<br>
<p>
I don't claim this to be the best of solutions. I certainly don't have "THE" answer. As I<br>
said at the beginning of my post, this is a dificult question. These are just some of my<br>
thoughts, and one possible starting point for a solution. What better solutions can we <br>
come up with?<br>
<p>
Regarding the first 'posters' statement at the top of this message: "If rationality is not<br>
wedded to truth then it is clearly irrationality." <br>
<p>
In order to respond to that I would have to ask you what your definitions of "rationality"<br>
and "truth" are. My <br>
definition of "truth" is a 100% accurate perception of "reality." (And yes, I do believe<br>
that there is in fact an "absolute reality," and that it is "out there". But I also believe <br>
that everyone has thier individual "construction" or perception of "reality" which is<br>
incomplete and can include incorrect information. Based upon my empirical <br>
observations/testing I believe that certain aspects of this <br>
"reality out there" are static, and that others are dynamic. No human or transhuman<br>
that I know of has evolved enough to have an "absolutely" 100% accurate perception <br>
of "reality" (ie omniscience). And since certain parts of this "reality" are changing <br>
constantly this would have to be an ongoing process.) <br>
  <br>
Nietzsche's opinion was that since everyones perception of "reality" is merely an <br>
approximation of that "absolute reality," all 'truths' or 'knowledge' are/is a form of 'useful fiction.'<br>
A sort of a pragamatic self deceit. His opinion was that when these ideas or 'useful <br>
fictions' stop producing desired results they should be thrown out and new "useful<br>
fictions" should be created of adopted. Hence he came up wth the aphorisms like "question<br>
everything" as tools to help with this. He also pointed out that these "useful fictions" frequently<br>
become seen as dogmatic absolutes, even long after they have ceased being useful.    <br>
<p>
For example, this has occured in the field of physics. First you had Aristotles physics.<br>
Then you had Galileos physics, but he was labled a heretic for quite some time, until<br>
some of his ideas were finally accepted, and Aristotles rejected. Then along came <br>
Einstein ... etc ...<br>
<p>
Another possible future example: at this point in the evolution of "our" <br>
(meaning human/transhuman) knowledge, many people<br>
believe Einstein's idea that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This <br>
is reasonable based upon the information "we" currently have. But some future<br>
information may "paint a bigger picture" about "the way things are". This new <br>
perspective might then open up other new possibilities which we did not "see" before. Such<br>
as traveling faster than the speed of light. (I hope so; the speed of light is too<br>
slow :-)<br>
<p>
One working definition of rationalsim: "using logic to make decisions based upon <br>
empirical data and experiential results". How's that for a def?  :-)  Not the only or best<br>
definition, but good enough for now. <br>
<p>
So I would say that "rationality" IS wedded to the "truth." The problem lies in what you <br>
consider to be "truth." Approximations are not black or white, they are grey. So things<br>
are not so easily put into the "rationality box" or the "irrationality box" - depending on<br>
the quality of your perceptions/information. You could call this the "argument from <br>
Fuzzyness." (I would really recommend Kosko's "Fuzzy Logic" for more on this).<br>
<p>
"So far as mathematics apply to reality, they are not certain. And so far as mathematics are <br>
certain, they do not apply to reality." -- Einstein <br>
(I'm quoting this from memory - I couldn't find the reference so, I may have it a little off.)<br>
<p>
Feedback appreciated (no flames please).<br>
