<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;will probably be undertaken by industry consortia who contract</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;with each other to share the risk and benefit of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Now you have given the world over to the industry consortiums who end up as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; virtual monopolies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Really? How come there is no evidence of these virtual monopolies?</i><br>
<p>
I thought we were talking about an idealized, theoretical system here.<br>
Virtual in the sense of 'monopolies in all senses'.. Such consortia exist<br>
today - look at OPEC and the drug cartels.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; An individual has no hope of being able to bring a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; revolutionary idea to life unless he sells his soul to the company store...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who did Martin Luther King Jr sell out to?</i><br>
<p>
His dream! And he won, even if posthumously. At least he lived in a world<br>
where he was the owner of his own ideas, and free to use them without fear<br>
of theft. He GAVE his dream to the world, and did not ask for money in<br>
return. His choice.<br>
<p>
In the scenario described, an inventor would be required by economic<br>
pressure to sign his rights over to some industry with the bucks to develop<br>
the idea, since he has 'no right' to keep others from making his device..<br>
and has too little money to develop it himself. Even if he lives through the<br>
R+D phase, once he markets it, others are free to copy, so his chance of<br>
seeing a profit is nil..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why was Robert Heinlein able to dictate to a publisher that they </i><br>
<i>&gt;would sign a certain contract, and then immediately renegotiate it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Maybe he was a smart man..and asserting his ownership rights..Why should he<br>
not be entitled to wrangle the best possible deal for his work?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I am not willing to wait for 'evolution' to generate the products I will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; need to survive in the next millennium. I want people to be able to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; leaps and bounds in creation, and benefit from their own efforts. I thought</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; we were supposed to improve on nature, not slavishly follow it..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is why a patent system is necessary: so that people CAN make </i><br>
<i>&gt;leaps and bounds in creation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Without a patent system, there is very little benefit to the inventor </i><br>
<i>&gt;in even the most obvious evolutionary improvement, let alone in </i><br>
<i>&gt;anything that takes any work.  And such little benefit as there is, </i><br>
<i>&gt;derives from PERSONAL use, not from making that improvement public </i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge -- so you will probably never learn of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You cannot expect to leap beyond state of the art, if you don't even </i><br>
<i>&gt;know what the state of the art is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The patent/copyright system is the reason that the state of the art </i><br>
<i>&gt;is publicized.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Why is this so hard to understand?<br>
