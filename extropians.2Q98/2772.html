ok.  suppose i want to explore the other end of the issue: voluntarily<br>
broadcasting to the world (anyone who cares, which i supposed would<br>
be very few) my every movement.  i want to cast all privacy to the<br>
wind!  reason:  i see this as the first step in forming a protoborg.<br>
<p>
the reason the borg is such a feared thing (organism, colony, society or<br>
whatever it is) is that it is entirely unclear that one might not<br>
actually<br>
wish to voluntarily join it, especially if one is weak, sick, poor or<br>
outcast from one's own society.  one gives up individuality, but<br>
perhaps one would get something valuable in return, such as being part of<br>
a really<br>
kick butt superorganism.<br>
<p>
nowthen, seems to me we have all the necessary technology now to form<br>
a protoborg, but we need a group of people willing to give up all privacy<br>
<p>
to all the others in the protoborg.  the individuals would wear some<br>
manner<br>
of headgear that contains a videocamera, a microphone, and<br>
transmitter/receiver,<br>
an earpiece and a (this is the tough part) a video imager of some sort,<br>
so that<br>
anything i see or hear can be seen or heard by any other subunit of the<br>
borg.<br>
likewise i can see or hear anything being seen or heard by any other<br>
subunit.<br>
the subunits could then communicate with each other at all times.<br>
obviously, there is<br>
no privacy whatsoever within the protoborg.  what are the<br>
possibilities?   spike<br>
