A double "HUH?".  I am aghast at the engineering naiveté of that statement. For<br>
transhumanity's purposes well into the next millennium w/o any significant<br>
scientific breakthroughs, their is enough energy to power global output at its<br>
current rate of consumption for several trillion years.  That energy source is the<br>
Sun.  It may not be infinite, but it is renewable for all intents and purposes.<br>
Another source of great promise is the thermal differential of the oceans which<br>
can be tapped using OTEC generators.  Again this is not an infinite source of<br>
energy but very renewable.  The differential tapped by the OTEC is renewed again<br>
by the thermal output of the sun.  With the combination of solar panels on land<br>
and OTEC's on the ocean, their would be enough energy output to easily transport<br>
all human culture right into the nanotech era; and with minimal impact on the<br>
environment.<br>
