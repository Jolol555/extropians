<i>&gt;1% chance of dying an unnatural death.  It's just that 1% of 100 is only</i><br>
<i>&gt;one-half of 1% of 200.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

I think this would apply only in an individual case. The previous post seemd<br>
to consider more than one person.<br>
<p>
If you look at a population, rather than an individual, the frequency of<br>
accidental deaths to natural ones must rise as the average lifespan<br>
increases, unless you also have a corresponding increase in safety. <br>
<p>
I can't conceive of living in a totally risk-free environment - no spice in<br>
life! We all must decide for ourselves what constitutes an acceptable risk.<br>
Of course, I would not welcome risk due to another person's attempts to<br>
relieve HIS boredom!<br>
