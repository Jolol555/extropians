Oops!  Typo!  I meant to write "is NOT equivalent to lying.":)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; At least, not all of it is lying.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Surely, some of it -- like any philosophy -- is off the mark.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, this is a tricky point.  As you must know, Rand herself was quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;hostile towards post-structuralism in particular, and I'm fairly certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;that political postmodernism, at the very least, wouldn't sit well with</i><br>

<i>&gt;postmodernists herself.  On the other hand, she was also quite hostile</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards libertarians, a position which I find puzzling to say the least.</i><br>
<p>
I would rather think of Objectivism as a philosophy originated by but not<br>
forever tied to Ayn Rand.  Rand is wrong about many things, including<br>
where her philosophy would lead.  Thus, her tendency to paint with a<br>
very broad brush -- with libertarians, for exampel -- can and must be<br>
rejected.  In fact, a major camp in the Objectivist movement -- the IOS<br>
camp -- rejects Rand's take on libertarians in particular.  See David<br>
Kelley's _Truth and Toleration_.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for hermeneutics, as I seem to recall, one of its central ideas was</i><br>
<i>&gt;that supposedly contradictory elements within a text would coalesce into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning by virtue of the fact that they contradict.  Depending on which</i><br>
<i>&gt;hemeneutic school you're addressing, this is either a restatement of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rand's flavor of the Aristotelian principle of non-contradiction or its</i><br>
<i>&gt;very antithesis.  Is hermeneutics trying to say that the contradictions</i><br>
<i>&gt;never truly existed, or that they are able to agree despite the fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;they contradict?  Different writers have answered this question</i><br>
<i>&gt;differently; I think most modern academics would agree more with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;latter than the former, and that Rand would disagree passionately. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not saying that all of hermeneutics is great and fine.  It's just that<br>
some of its methodology is worth looking into.  Some of it can definitely<br>
be removed from the wider corpus, just as not everyone who uses a<br>
syllogism agrees with Aristotle's whole philosophy.  (Bertrand Russell,<br>
for instance, used syllogisms, yet he disagreed with Aristotle's meta-<br>
physics.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyway, I don't assert that poststructuralists are lying to try to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves better funding; rather that they may simply be wrong.  :) </i><br>
<p>
A point with which I can agree upon.  There is also a lot of sloppy<br>
thinking going on out there and a lot of postmodern philosophy is<br>
just that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The thing to do is to look dispassionately at the methods and ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; For example, it seems that Sciabarra is onto something when he says</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Objectivism is dialectical in method -- even if Objectivists don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it.  It might disagree with other dialectical philosophies, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Hegelianism and Marxism, but this doesn't change his point.  Both</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Newtonian and Einsteinian physics lead to different conclusions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; despite having similar methods.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm having a hard time reconciling these ideas in my mind, especially with</i><br>
<i>&gt;respect to individuality vs. collectivism.</i><br>
<p>
Sciabarra's take would be, I believe, that the above is a false alternative,<br>
a dualism of social atomism and of social organicism.  The first view sees<br>
individuals as totally separate from and with little need for society, while<br>
the latter sees individuals as totally constituted and in need of society.<br>
Individualism transcends this dualism by defining the proper relation<br>
between individuals, which allows them to benefit from living in society<br>
without being smothered by it (as in collectivism) or destroying it (as in<br>
social atomism).<br>
<p>
(For another take on this, see Marsha Familiaro Enright's "Why Man<br>
Needs Approval" in _Objectivity_ 1(2) [1991].  This article covers the<br>
psychological needs for a social life in humans.  This goes beyond<br>
economic arguments.  Details on _Objectivity_ can be found at:<br>
<a href="http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/">http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/</a> )<br>
<p>
Robert White, in his "Racism:  A Radical Critique," applies Sciabarra's<br>
take on this to the problem of racism in New Zealand.  He shows how<br>
racism as a form of collectivism emphasizes social contradictions -- <br>
antagonisms inherent in the structure of society.  He also calls for the<br>
adoption of individualism to overcome these antagonisms.  This paper<br>
was printed in _The Free Radical_ and can be found at:<br>
<p>
        <a href="http://freeradical.co.nz/">http://freeradical.co.nz/</a><br>
<p>
I don't know if I buy all of this, but it does seem to show that dialectics<br>
do not necessarily lead to left-wing (a la Marx) or right-wing (a la<br>
Hegel) politics.  If Sciabarra (see also his _Marx, Hayek, and Utopia_)<br>
and White are correct, then various strains of libertarianism are no less<br>
dialectical than Marxism et al.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Applying the dialectic to</i><br>
<i>&gt;politics, as Marx points out, seems to lead us to a certain inevitability</i><br>
<i>&gt;in history.  I'm quite certain Rand would disagree with this, emphasizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead the role of the individual in historical events.  Maybe I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;looking too much at the philosophy itself rather than its methods, but in</i><br>
<i>&gt;my mind the two seem inseparable. </i><br>
<p>
Rand's view of history is the topic of the last third of Sciabarra's _Ayn<br>
Rand: The Russian Radical_.  Also, see her _For the New Intellectual_.<br>
Her theory wasn't so simple as you portray it.  She believed that<br>
philosophy determined culture which in term determined politics.  She<br>
did not think this determination was total, however, she did feel that<br>
lone individuals could only do so much.  Hence her efforts to spark<br>
philosophical change.  Even so, she did not think this would happen<br>
quickly.<br>
<p>
Her novel, _We the Living_, is in a way a testament to the individual's<br>
need for a free society to flourish and even survive.<br>
<p>
As far as how her view was dialectical, though a society's overall<br>
philosophy determines the type of society on lives in, each person<br>
can, to a degree, choose her or his philosophy and shape the<br>
wider culture.  This back-and-forth influence is dialectical, is it not?<br>
<p>
But the question here should be: Do dialectics imply historical<br>
determinism of any sort?  I do not think they do.  Dialactics are a<br>
method of ascertaining the truth.  It just so happens that Marx<br>
was a determinist.  This no more means that dialectics must be<br>
determinist than the fact that Einstein believed in God implies<br>
General Relativity Theory must be theistic.<br>
<p>
