My gut tells me that you are right, but your humor is premised on the sense of<br>
my uncertainty.  Perhaps I have missed some important new development, but the<br>
DEFINITE correlation of speed with ultimate capability via genetic algorithms<br>
seems to have the distinct flavor of hand-waving to me (to mix metaphors).  <br>
<p>
A critique of this idea occurs to me after only part of one cup of coffee this<br>
morning.  I can imagine that employment of genetic algorithms alone might<br>
entail an accretion of inefficiency through multiple generations of<br>
algorithmic evolution that eventually either offsets gains in hardware speed<br>
or even effectively nullifies it.  <br>
<p>
More probable seems a subtler loss of the ability to control the specific<br>
direction algorithmic evolution takes as it progresses in complexity.  Perhaps<br>
there is a dynamic tension between control and evolution that could offset<br>
much of the speed-derived gains, such that the necessity to intervene in the<br>
process to check-and-direct with human (even augmented human) intervention in<br>
the algorithmic evolutionary process imposes a relatively low upper limit on<br>
at least the first stages of "SI fetal development".<br>
<p>
Rather enjoying the atypical role of progress-skeptic, I remain,<br>
