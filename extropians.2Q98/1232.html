I believe I found the answer to the Base n<br>
"puzzle" I raised. I also believe that the <br>
model I presented yesterday is not only <br>
not the solution, but it does not work.<br>
<p>
The answer is the Alternative Number System (ANS),<br>
which was published in the "Southwest Journal of<br>
Pure and Applied Mathematics" (12/95), by Robert <br>
R. Forslund. ANS seems to be more logical than <br>
the current number system, which uses 0 as a<br>
placeholder. ANS eliminates 0 as a placeholder.<br>
The digit "A" replaces 10, and thus 1A = 20.<br>
<p>
The result is that Base 1 (the tally mark system,<br>
which is the logical reality/basis of all number <br>
systems) is NOT invalidated as it is by our current<br>
number system, which uses 0 as a placeholder. ANS<br>
also results in greater data compression, expres-<br>
sed by the use of fewer digits to express a given <br>
number. The measure of the ability to compress<br>
data in this fashion measures the utility of<br>
a given number system versus tally marks.<br>
<p>
As I see it, ANS does not invalidate 0 in its use<br>
outside its function as a place holder, such that <br>
even with ANS, we'd still say: y + (-y) = 0. I see<br>
this as a preferable use of 0, since 0 essentially <br>
means "no number," it should not be in numbers.<br>
<p>
