<i> &gt; &gt; According to my exhaustive research conducted over a lifetime, a diet</i><br>
high<br>
<i> &gt; &gt; in pizza, salt, eggs, beer and vodka, with an ice cream chaser,</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; contributes to longevity in humans. Note I have done this research</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; personally on my own body, you do not have to extrapolate data from fruit</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; flies and rats. This is the real thing, tested and proved on my human</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; (more or less) body.</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; The proof is that I have lasted into my fifth decade. It was intimated by</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; doctors and friends when I was in my second decade that if I continued</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; eating and drinking with such wild abandon, I would not reach the age of</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; thirty. Boy, did I prove them wrong. And look at all the fun I had</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; doing it! </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
 <br>
I suspect this was written "tounge in cheek"...or perhaps your trawling for a<br>
fight from militant vegitarians..(that term always conjours up the visual of<br>
an anthropomorpized venus flytrap  type Rambo...Killer Kabbage..)<br>
<p>
Howsomever...It may bear an embarassing relationship to the truth.<br>
<p>
I've been reading a book by Robert C. Atkins, M.D.  "Dr. Atkins New Diet<br>
Revolution"<br>
<p>
It makes sense to me...a thumbnail is that due to an overabundance of<br>
carbohydrates in modern diet...and the intertwingleness of gylocogen,<br>
sugars...etc and their effect on the hormones in the human body...notably<br>
insulin...that many  fat people (myself included i imagine &lt;5'll...260lbs&gt;<br>
develope a condition he calls "hyperinsulinism"...which over an extend time<br>
leads to all manner of bad things..notably obeseity...and it's attendant<br>
ills.(heart attacks, diabetes, strokes...and other nasty stuff)...<br>
<p>
The problem being that someone suffereing from said ailment (hyperinsulinism)<br>
has a well neigh impossibe task facing him trying to loose weight via<br>
conventionally prescribed methods...i.e. cut back calories...<br>
<p>
His diet (grossly simplified for space sake) has basicly only one rule...cut<br>
back on carbohydrated to less than 25grams a day...for the "induction<br>
diet".(eat ANYTHING else...and as much as you want..just NO carbs) .this<br>
induces a state of "ketosis"...&lt;medical term...means fat burning&gt;...therefor<br>
weight is lots...but NO (well hardly any) lean muscel mass.<br>
<p>
So........I imagine the militant veggies are a trifle upset with this...it<br>
could be called a "hi protein" , "hi fat" or "meat eaters" diet.<br>
<p>
I've talked to several people who swear by it...claiming weight loss of ten<br>
pounds a month...(more...but lets not get too carried away)...<br>
<p>
So...as I sit here eating a double western omlette....I'm thinking it might be<br>
the thing for me...<br>
