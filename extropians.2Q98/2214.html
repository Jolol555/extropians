That's unfortunate that others invited have not participated, as the content of<br>
polymath-l has often been compelling and informative.  Thanks for allowing<br>
*anyone* to read it.  When I asked for alternatives to your format, I was thinking<br>
of a more decentralized exclusivity mechanism, yet remaining open for reading by<br>
all.  ExI's decision to make NodeNet only open to members is definitely *not* what<br>
I had in mind.<br>

<p>
Nothing wrong with competition, but on the other hand its the balkanization of<br>
mailing lists of the NodeNet proposal that give me the sinking feeling that ExI is<br>
isolating itself out of existence.Although if you have a few extra moments, I<br>
would interested in hearing about what are the technical requirements for starting<br>
a mailing list.<br>
