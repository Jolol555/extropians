Berrie Staring:<br>

<i>&gt;Here in the Netherlands they are starting with </i><br>
<i>&gt;a national database of all the people in Holland, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;which they record what you would like to be done</i><br>
<i>&gt;with your organs should you die. We all have to fill</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a form and express our wish. Up on our death the</i><br>
<i>&gt;doctors will immediately contact this database and ask</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the wish. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
What does "die" mean? Brain death, or cardiorespiratory death?<br>
What are the standards in the Netherlands regarding<br>
establishing death? Is it possible for a person to be<br>
on life support (ie, vegetable) to be dead?<br>
<p>
I am not a doctor, but am an Alcor Cryptransport Certified<br>
Technician. The impression I have is that waiting for<br>
brain death is not a good idea! Mentioning BD is a very<br>
poor idea! Cardiac death is the best way to have a still<br>
preservable brain (much simplification here).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Since "we" sign up for Cryonics it is not wise to express</i><br>
<i>&gt;the wish, that we would like to donate our organs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also on this form there is no room to put in writing what</i><br>
<i>&gt;wish you may have (a missed opportunity IMHO).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Alcor requires a Whole Body Anatomical Donation. I don't<br>
know how that would relate to your situation. I expect that<br>
it would be hard to get life support for a WBAD.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, there is the option to give an other person the</i><br>
<i>&gt;right to choose for you. So, I could appoint a member of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Transcedo to make sure that they don't use my organs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Perhaps the other person is the cryonics provider...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The beauty of this is, that he/she will be contacted ASAP.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I suspect ONLY if the remains have viable organs. Otherwise<br>
ASAP may take hours or days.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Second: they will keep me "alive" until the decision is made,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this could be very valuable I think.......</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Only a small percentage of terminal cases leave viable organs<br>
for harvesting. It is far better to have the cryo team on site<br>
when you die, and this TAKES PREPARATION. In my case, I plan<br>
to relocate to Scottsdale when my condition becomes terminal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Please share your opinion. Is it a good thing to use this </i><br>
<i>&gt;option?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think it's very useful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;or do we risk a lot of damage by the "waiting"</i><br>
<i>&gt;period. </i><br>
<p>
Once you have ischemia, you have to do a lot of things quickly<br>
to keep the brain intact. I doubt this would be done as no one<br>
has a use for transplanting brains. Also, the cryo based procedures<br>
do not support viability of brains or other organs.<br>
