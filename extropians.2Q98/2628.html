 &lt;&lt; What, like faith that it is impossible to (or that we<br>
  shouldn't) overcome evil and all that which ails us?  After all, if<br>
  there is a God, we must find some way to justify why God hasn't<br>
  overcome evil.  If an all powerful God can't (or shouldn't) overcome<br>
  evil, we must abandon all hope that we can (or should) overcome evil<br>
  with our science.  If God can't, how can we?<br>

The problem with this argument is that the only people it confounds are those<br>
without any knowledge of theology whatsoever.  From a fundamentalist point of<br>
view, evil exists only because we created it and choose to let it exist.   The<br>
Fall (eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil) happened because<br>
God created us as beings of free will.  Adam and Eve's act of disobedience God<br>
is why evil exists.  God can, of course, overcome evil, and in the<br>
fundamentalist view, eventually will thru the Rapture and the  overthrowing of<br>
the Beast. Then Pat Robertson &amp; Jerry Falwell will rule the earth (shudder).<br>
<p>
 In a less fundamentalist view, the Eden story is seen as allegorical, free<br>
will exists in us because if it did not, we would simply be extension of God<br>
rather than independent creatures (and what would be the point in creating us<br>
if that's so?) and evil will cease to exist once mankind rids himself of it.<br>
One might say that God can defeat evil, and we just happen to be his tool for<br>
doing so.  From my point of view, Transhumanist thought is a giant step in<br>
that direction.<br>
