<p>
&lt;&lt; On the topic of "Why the X-Files is Scary", William Gibson had this to say:<br>
 <br>
 'What we are afraid of is that we are becoming posthuman, that Earth is the<br>
 alien planet and that we are the aliens...'<br>
 <br>
 I don't sound, it sounded fairly glib when he said it.  Is this really what<br>
 scares people?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I think that what he may mean is the same old fear of the unknown...taken to<br>
the point where even we ourselves are the unknown...It wasn't that long ago<br>
that people could take a measure of security in knowing that even if the rest<br>
of the planet was a strange, often frightening place, humans knew what they<br>
were and had confidence that we were the be all end all... Even tho that was<br>
and is a false sense of security, people had it.   Now, however, if our<br>
children are likely to be as different in their mindset from us as we are from<br>
our ancestors of  2 or three generations ago.  <br>
<p>
I'm not really putting this well, I realise, but it seems to me that it is<br>
linked to the quickening pace of change and the greater realization of our<br>
potential.  We ( humans collectively ) are afraid of that potential to a<br>
degree, unsure of how to cope with the responsibility of being "adults" as it<br>
were.  <br>
<p>
The same sort of fear we felt the first time each of us left home and went out<br>
to wing it on our own... <br>
