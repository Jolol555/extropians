Macilwain, C. (1998). Physicists seek definition of "science". Nature,<br>
392 (30 April, 1998): 849.<br>
<p>
[WASHINGTON] The governing council of the American Physical Society<br>
(APS) has rejected the first draft of a statement defining science<br>
for the public, which the society's public affairs panel has been<br>
preparing for three years. According to an official familiar with the<br>
discussion, some members were concerned by a proposed reference to<br>
"other approaches" to understanding nature.<br>
        Others are said to have been worried about public misunderstanding<br>
of the statement's references to "falsifiability". The authors of the<br>
draft 200-word statement have been asked to confer with scientific<br>
societies and other interested parties before coming back with a new<br>
version later this year.<br>
        The case for such a statement has been recently confirmed by opinion<br>
polls showing that public belief in forms of pseudoscience - such as<br>
faith healing and astrology - is growing in the United States. But<br>
the rejection of the draft, although not unusual for such a policy<br>
statement, illustrates the difficulties that scientists face in<br>
trying to draw a recognizable line between their own work and<br>
pseudoscience.<br>
        The statement, entitled "What is Science?", defines science as "a<br>
disciplined quest to understand nature in all its aspects" and<br>
explains that it demands both "open and complete exchange of ideas<br>
and data" and "an attitude of scepticism about its own tenets".<br>
        It stresses that scientific results must be capable of reproduction,<br>
modification or falsification by independent observers. And it closes<br>
by noting that "scientists value other, complementary approaches to<br>
and methods of understanding nature", but that "if the alternatives<br>
are to be called scientific, they must adhere to the principles<br>
outlined above".<br>
        Following the drafts rejection by the council at a meeting last week<br>
in Columbia, Ohio, the APS may now draw up two statements - one for<br>
wide public dissemination and the other a more rigorous explanatory<br>
statement for scientists themselves.<br>
        The society decided to produce the statement in response to the<br>
concerns of key members that 'pseudoscience' is not only winning<br>
increased public attention but may even be causing confusion among<br>
science students. APS members have been active in criticizing this<br>
trend not just in cases related to physics - such as the alleged<br>
discovery of 'cold fusion' - but also in other fields, such as<br>
alternative medicine.<br>
