Help! I've recently developed a web-based survey (multi-page) designed to<br>
assess the general public's familiarity with and attitudes toward the idea<br>
of Cryonics, and I need help writing the CGI script to process the input<br>
data and create a database which could be imported into SPSS or some other<br>
statistical program. I've visited several sites that discuss these scripts<br>
and if it was a simpler form, I'd keep at it but I just don't have the<br>
skills and really don't have the time to learn PERL.  If you're familiar<br>
with CGI and could volunteer the hour or so it would proably take to make<br>
this survey interactive, the cryonics community and I would be appreciative.<br>
If you can help, please e-mail me directly.  I'd also appreciate any ideas<br>
from others on this list regarding how I might get maximum exposure for this<br>
survey with minimum expense.<br>
<p>
Once it's on-line and interactive, I'll give out the address and request<br>
feedback from y'all.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
