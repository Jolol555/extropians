<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I recently said there was one thing in _Contact_ that's been on my</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind recently, now thanks to the flurry of responses there's another.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At the end of the film the overall message seems to be that science</i><br>
<i>&gt; and religion don't have to be opponents because they both seek to</i><br>
<i>&gt; attain the same goal - truth.  I think this is wrong and is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamental reason for the religious opposition to science.  Science</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not seek "truth" that is the sole aim of religious groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Instead science seeks to develop theory, these theories are judged by</i><br>
<i>&gt; their applications in the real world.  For instance, it doesn't matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; if quantum mechanic's is true or false as long as I can build a</i><br>
<i>&gt; working quantum computer.  I think science needs to make a clearer</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinction between truth and theory, especially in areas that clash</i><br>
<i>&gt; with religious beliefs.  Evolutionary theory has clashed on many</i><br>
<i>&gt; occasions with creationism, I think this is largely due to scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrongly suggesting that creationism is entirely untrue and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary theory proves this.  Creationism is not of importance to</i><br>
<i>&gt; science simply because it has no application in it, whereas evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; has bread artificial life, genetic research, game theory, etc.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; abundance of applications does not mean evolution is true and</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly does not mean creationism is false.  But scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasingly "attack" religious beliefs, which means religious groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to defend themselves and look at science as an opposing belief</i><br>
<i>&gt; system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

Actually, I think the pious become defensive more over the facts that<br>
science brings to light rather than personal attacks, but otherwise you<br>
raise a good point.  What you said explains perfectly why science<br>
doesn't need religion, but you left out an important point:  the<br>
emotional reasons that people need religion, and need to see it as some<br>
kind of "truth" and not just an educated guess.  In nearly all cases<br>
this stems from some sort of fear, whether it's fear of no life after<br>
death, isolation, etc.  I think this is the reason scientists tend to<br>
look down on religious people.  They see the religion as nothing more<br>
than a crutch to pacify a person's weak emotional fears, with no other<br>
potential for good.  Personally, I believe there's a great deal of<br>
validity in this, though such a person's weaknesses always manifest<br>
themselves in more concrete, destructive ways than going to church on<br>
Sundays.  I think most scientifically inclined agnostics realize that if<br>
the masses are taught better logic than religion will decline on it's<br>
own.  Those logically educated individuals I know who still claim to<br>
believe in God have reduced their so-called religions to such a vague,<br>
undefined state that they remain only a blemish on their otherwise<br>
secular lifestyle.<br>
    But enough about that.  I also have a few problems with "Contact" as<br>
a film that the over-fawning reviewers seem to consider irrelevant.<br>
First of all, am I the only one who thought the entire movie reminded<br>
them of the juvenile discussions you used to get into when you first<br>
renounced religion but still hadn't been sufficiently educated in<br>
philosophy to make a good case on your own, that is without a Nietzsche<br>
textbook to quote from?  I actually read the book before I saw the<br>
movie, and for someone of Carl Sagan's stature it kind of reeked of a<br>
sell-out.  Kind of like he thought he could get society to immediately<br>
embrace science if he just admitted "God's OK."  The only problem is he<br>
makes a completely backward case for his cause.  For instance, at first<br>
the climactic meeting with the aliens seems to make a juvenile fairy<br>
tale of Christianity, until for no apparent reason Sagan has the alien<br>
representative admit to Ellie that the worm holes they use to traverse<br>
the universe were "there when they got here", ie it could very well have<br>
been God that made them.  What???  In a book full of cop-outs this one<br>
takes the cake.<br>
    Another point the reviewers have focused on is how long it's been<br>
since a woman held such a prominent and dignified part in a mainstream<br>
Hollywood film.  That may be true, but despite the superficial sense<br>
that in the end science and religion have been reconciled on equal<br>
terms, deeper analysis reveals that it is Ellie who has been defeated<br>
without any real compromise on the part of Christianity (yes, the movie<br>
criticizes the masses' perception of religion, but this seems a poor<br>
tradeoff considering science is pissed on from the highest of academic<br>
standpoints).  I found Sagan's symbolic representation of the sexual<br>
union between Ellie (science) and Palmer Joss (religion) to be equally<br>
revolting.  And what good does it do to have a strong female in a lead<br>
role if at the end she is sent home defeated in the triumphant arms of a<br>
male?<br>
