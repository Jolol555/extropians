<i>&gt;&gt; Here is the current list of suggested forums for NodeNet. Suggestions for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; others are welcome, as well as inquiries about NodeMastering any of these.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let me add to my list of suggestions:</i><br>
<i>&gt;- Investing and Money Management</i><br>
<p>
I thought this was already on the list, but I see it isn't. I'll definitely<br>
add it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Action Requests (pointers to online surveys, e-mail campaigns,</i><br>
<i>&gt;letterwriting campaigns, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
Probably a good idea, if the NodeNet is to include more than academic<br>
discussions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Basics (a place to discuss basic beliefs so they can be excluded from</i><br>
<i>&gt;other nodes!)</i><br>
<p>
The "basics" can be discussed on this list (which will become<br>
Extropians-Open). I don't think a special list for it would be useful,<br>
since most people needed to ask about the basics will not be in the NodeNet<br>
forums, but will most likely be on the Extropians-Open list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Polling Forum (for surveying Extropians' on questions, although a</i><br>
<i>&gt;survey webpage might be better)</i><br>
<p>
I don't expect us to do a lot of polling. If we need to do ExI-related<br>
polling, we can do that on the Extropians-Select list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- ExI Announcements (for official ExI information)</i><br>
<p>
That's a good idea. Some members may not want to subscribe even to<br>
Extropians-Select if they are restricting their volume of mail. A very-low<br>
traffic Announcement list would let them get quick updates.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- ExI Member Announcements (for members to their promote web pages,</i><br>
<i>&gt;books, businesses, requests for jobs, public appearances, galleries,</i><br>
<i>&gt;projects, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
We were considering a web page for this, but an announcement list would be<br>
much easier to maintain. However, I'm not sure whether a separate list is<br>
needed, or whether this can be part of the function of the<br>
Extropians-Select list. What do others think?<br>
<p>
Thanks for your suggestions.<br>
<p>
