I am proposing an idea, and I would like to see if there's any enthusiam for<br>
it among extropians.  In short, Project Star Net (PSN) would aim to establish<br>
an interstellar communication network.  Right now PSN is still in the<br>
"thinking about it" stage, and I want to see if there's any interest in<br>
forming an organization to pursue this worthy goal.<br>
<p>
Nothing is written in stone at this early stage, but I do have a certain<br>
vision that can serve as a basis for discussion.<br>
<p>
I'm assuming there will be no sci-fi FTL stardrive.  I've heard attempts to<br>
describe how such a drive might work, but they leave me unconvinced.  Even if<br>
theory allows something like that to exist, the engineering difficulties are<br>
overwhelming.  I'm not aware of any technology on the horizon that will let us<br>
conjure up quantum singularities or magnetic monopoles.<br>
<p>
So, I reckon the fastest and most efficient form of interstellar communication<br>
and travel will be via the EM spectrum.  I envision a station (or node) in<br>
each stellar system with powerful transmitters and receivers, thus allowing<br>
data to be relayed to a specific destination, or propagated through the<br>
network as a general broadcast.<br>
<p>
A major goal would be the translocation (or "faxing") of persons across the<br>
network.  So, if you wanted to visit Alpha Centauri, you could fax yourself<br>
there in four years objective time, or zero subjective.  This would obviously<br>
require some advanced technology to deconstruct the traveller and to recreate<br>
him at the destination -- based on what I know of nanotechnology, it seems<br>
reasonable that this could exist in the near future (i.e. within 50 years or<br>
so).  If the technology proves impractical, the Star Net would be much less<br>
useful, but still worth establishing purely as a communication device.<br>
<p>
Because of the sheer size of the network and the associated netlag, it could<br>
not be centrally managed.  In fact, once the first node is established, the<br>
Star Net should automatically manage and maintain itself, and launch "seeds"<br>
to establish new nodes, thus replicating until it ultimately spans our entire<br>
galaxy.  This will require a certain level of artificial intelligence.<br>
<p>
(BTW, I feel AI and nanotech are symbiotic fields of technology: they will<br>
feed one another.  My view of PSN hinges on concurrent advances in both<br>
fields.)<br>
<p>
Now you have the general concept.  If we assume this may become feasible<br>
sometime in the next 50 years or so, then it may not be too soon to start<br>
planning and organizing to make it happen, and to be sure it's done right.<br>
If PSN becomes a going concern, one of the first orders of business will be<br>
studies to answer some important questions:<br>
<p>
   * What is the most efficient way to launch "seed" probes across<br>
     interstellar space?  Also, how small can such seeds be made?<br>
<p>
   * What types of star systems should be candidates for<br>
     establishing nodes?<br>
<p>
   * What part or parts of the EM spectrum are suited to our use.<br>
<p>
   * What are the practical limits of data throughput across<br>
     interstellar distances?<br>
<p>
   * What are the data requirements of transmitting a person?  What<br>
     if the traveller is enhanced with extra memory -- do you charge<br>
     by the gigabyte, or have a fixed rate for everybody?<br>
<p>
   * What other types of data might be transmitted?  Free news,<br>
     perhaps?<br>
<p>
   * How can access to the network be allocated fairly?<br>
<p>
   * What is the most likely way to finance the project?<br>
<p>
   * How will the network respond if it "bumps into" an alien<br>
     civilization?<br>
<p>
   * If a star system is over-populated, can its inhabitants tell<br>
     their station to refuse any new arrivals?  Are there other<br>
     situations that could justify this option?  And what happens<br>
     to the traveller who the station doesn't accept?<br>
<p>
   * What kind of data security is required on transmissions?<br>
     What degree of encryption, error correction, and redundancy<br>
     is desirable?<br>
<p>
Well, I could ramble on, but I expect I've posted enough to get some debate<br>
started.  I really look forward to seeing opinions and ideas on this subject,<br>
but most of all: Does it makes sense to form an official organization at this<br>
point in time?<br>
