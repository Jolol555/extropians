A politician's silly idea is far more likely to turn out to be random noise <br>

<p>
<p>
You think everybody is stupid and evil except for the leaders of your <br>
centralized government. Yes I know, checks and balances, but they're only as <br>
good as the people who implement them. With such massive surveillance in <br>
place and the assumption that officials can quickly and easily determine the <br>
truth, your system has no room for error, if there is the slightest mistake<br>
in the astronomically complex checks and balances required your system will <br>
quickly turn into hell. My system is more fault tolerant, if one PPA goes bad <br>
there are plenty more fish in the sea.<br>

<i>        &gt;The internet owes its existence to the computernetworks of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;centralized states, mainly the US. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Most of the hardware is in nations, it has to be, except for Antarctica every  <br>
square inch of the Earth's surface is in some centralized state, but no state  <br>
owns the Internet, pays for it, operates it, or, despite their best efforts,  <br>
makes rules about it.<br>
                     <br>

<i>        &gt;It can also "work" because it's very limited, all bits 'n'bites and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;no physical contact. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Physical contact is a sensation that tells us about the outside world, <br>
sensation can be simulated with enough information, information is just <br>
bits 'n'bites.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it is still a playground of the more advanced layres of society; </i><br>
<p>
And growing rapidly.<br>

<p>
<p>
But most important people are.<br>

<i>        &gt;most of all, the net is something you can turn off and ignore with         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the touch of a button if you don't like it.</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
When the world's economy becomes deeply intertwined with the net turning it        <br>
off would be like a nation turning off its electrical power grid because it <br>
decided it didn't like it  anymore.                           <br>

<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;yes, there *is* something like "common sense".</i><br>
                     <br>
But the trouble is it's not very common.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;sometimes good products are suppressed because they threaten the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;position of some big powerful company that happens to operate in the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;same niche. </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
On a few occasions big powerful companies have tried that and it has caused <br>
great misery, for the company. IBM had one of the best research and <br>
development labs in the world, they fully understood the power of a<br>
microprocessor but didn't want to make a cheap computer based on one because <br>
it would hurt their mainframe business and they figured if they didn't do it <br>
nobody would. They were wrong. When Apple started to grow at a phenomenal <br>
rate they panicked and knew they had to something fast but were unprepared <br>
with their own technology so they had to start selling an INTEL- Microsoft <br>
machine that was given the misleading name the IBM PC, the most colossal <br>
business blunder in history. IBM's fate was sealed when a few years later <br>
when they refused to make a machine more powerful than some of their <br>
mainframes based of Intel's new 32 bit chip the 386. Compaq didn't hesitate <br>
to do so and the rest is history. <br>
<p>
A more recent example is Motorola, a few years ago they owned the analog <br>
cellular phone market, when digital phones became available they saw no  <br>
reason to change and figured if they didn't do it nobody would. They were <br>
wrong and now the company is in trouble.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Only a powerful state can put these things right, thus achieving a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;higher level of progress and product quality for the consumer to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;enjoy.      </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You've got to be kidding. Janet Reno is going to show Microsoft the correct <br>
way to write an operating system?              <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Indeed, democracy sucks and I should rule the world.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
One slight modification on that and it would indeed be a perfect system.                                                        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;government workers (like police etc.) would be paid according to the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;amount and quality of their work, and be fired when found inadequate,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;just like in any market-oriented company. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Every politician elected in at least the last 50 years has said almost the   <br>
exact same thing in his campaign speeches, but it has not happened, it has  <br>
never come close and it never will.   <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex, providing mediocre yet somehow         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"appealing" services and taking out competition left and right by         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;any means necessary.     </i><br>
   <br>
<p>
I can't imagine it. Why is this PPA so powerful? It's doing some very  <br>
expensive things so it's easy to see why service is only mediocre, but why do  <br>
its customers stick with it and keep pumping it with more money than any  <br>
other PPA?                <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I belief there are such things as objective facts </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree, but we won't always agree what those facts are or who can best find <br>
them.                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Dispite (undoubtedly) heroic efforts, anything only vaguely         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;resembling a libertarian party is pitifully small in any country of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;significance.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The Libertarian party is irrelevant as are all political parties. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Anarcho-capitalism on the other hand is IMO based on the false         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;premise that people will just turn en masse to libertarianism once        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;they get the chance (or have been  "educated"). Well, it ain't gonna         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;happen.</i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
I know. The world I describe won't happen because politicians pass laws or <br>
because somebody with a golden tongue convinces the average man it would be a <br>
good idea. It will happen because the present nation states will not be able <br>
to continue and something will be needed to replace it. This will be a <br>
dangerous transition because the PPA system is not the only thing that could <br>
take its place, for that reason I hope things don't happen too quickly.  <br>
I don't know how fast the bottom will fall out, all nations might collapse  <br>
as fast as the USSR did. I hope not.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think a centralized and maybe somewhat totalitarian system based         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;on values of maximal freedom (allow anything as long as no-one gets         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;hurt without consent) is the best way to go. Utopic? Sure. But not         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;any more than anarcho capitalism. The former may fail because of        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;corruption of the leadership, while the latter fails because  the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;common man just ain't no libertarian </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not counting on the average man being one bit more libertarian than he is <br>
right now, I am counting on a system that would make non libertarian laws <br>
harder to enforce. I don't like you reading dirty books so I vote for a <br>
prudish politician who says he will stop you, why not, it's no skin off my <br>
nose. The really beauty part is that you still must pay your taxes so you<br>
end up paying  for your own harassment. In the world of Anarchy I still don't <br>
like you reading dirty books  but now if I want to stop you I must write a <br>
check to the book police, and a  big one because you can write checks too. <br>
Lots of people want to tell you how to live your life but they don't want to <br>
pay for the privilege, in fact  most think their advice is so wonderful you <br>
should pay them. I imagine lots of people will be whining about how ungodly <br>
things have become and be nostalgic for the good old days of censorship, <br>
drug laws, gambling laws, sex laws, suicide laws, slander laws and Janet Reno.<br>
