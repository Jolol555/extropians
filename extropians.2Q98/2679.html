<i>&gt;  &lt;&lt; So maybe one should regard the interpretation as more </i><br>
<i>&gt;fundamental that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information. I like that because it gives you a more process oriented</i><br>
view<br>
<i>&gt; (its not as platonic). But then, given the right interpretation, an</i><br>
<i>&gt; interpretation itself can be interpreted as information. And we're kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; back were we started...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I disagree.  I think that there has to be information to be gained via</i><br>
<i> &gt;interpretation.  In other words, there must be information before there</i><br>
<i> &gt;can be any interpretation, but there cannot be interpretation without</i><br>
<i> &gt;information (no matter how trivial it might be).</i><br>
<p>
There is another  issue which one must also consider when attempting to<br>
specify "fundamentality"; it must be taken in context.  For example, there<br>
are different meanings of 'fundamental' - one being constituitive, while<br>
another is 'relationship' based (one before the other .... if you know what<br>
I mean).  Finally, there is the fundamentality of what 'things' *are* - which<br>
is basically unanswerable.<br>
<p>
For example, what *is* matter, what *is* energy, and what *is*<br>
information?  I don't think any of these can be decomposed into anything<br>
else more 'fundamental' - they simply are.  However, the fundametal<br>
*particles* of matter may be electrons, quarks etc. Information does not,<br>
instrinsically, have a 'fundamental' unit, though one has been defined as<br>
the 'bit', while for energy the same can be said (I think ....), but with<br>
various units defined and accepted.<br>
<p>
Felix made a good observation RE: the qualitative vs the quantitative<br>
natures of information.  I can't say too much about this, except that I think<br>
'meaning' or perhaps another word is more appropriate when speaking<br>
about the qualitative aspects of information.<br>
<p>
As an aside, Einstein has already shown the equivalence between<br>
energy and matter, while Michael Nielsen's comment regarding error<br>
correction for reversible architectures (he describes error correction as<br>
a procedure for lowering the entropy of a physical system, which<br>
consequently results in heat ie. energy being dissipated into the<br>
environment) is an example that shows there are strong connections<br>
between 'energy' and 'information'.  (Another exampe, the entropy of a<br>
physical system is calculated in terms of energy in joules or calories,<br>
while the entropy in information theory is in terms of bits).<br>
