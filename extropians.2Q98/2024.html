Within a few days we will be making some changes.<br>
<p>
The Extropians list will become two lists:<br>
<p>
Extropians-Open -- this will be the direct descendent of the current<br>
Extropians list. Its nickname will be "Extropians" and posting to that same<br>
address will continue to work. This list will be open to everyone, member<br>
and non-member, Extropian, non-Extropian, and anti-Extropian alike. All<br>
topics are open to discussion, including "the basics".<br>
<p>
Extropians-Select -- this will be for Extropy Institute members only.<br>
Rather than debating the basic values shared by Extropians, the purpose of<br>
this list will be to discuss ideas in depth, to post news items, and to<br>
discuss strategies for spreading extropians ideas and for implementing them<br>
in our own lives (life extension, intelligence increase, psychological<br>
improvement, etc.).<br>
<p>
ACTION ITEM: To remain on this list (becoming the Extropians-Open List),<br>
you need do nothing. To make sure you are on the Extropians-Select List,<br>
you need to (a) make sure we have your current email address; (b) make sure<br>
your ExI membership is current. If you're not sure (the expiration date was<br>
on the mailing label of the last issue of Exponent), call or email me and I<br>
can tell you. You can renew by using the online form at<br>
&lt;www.extropy.org/join.htm&gt;, or by emailing me your credit card info,<br>
address, etc. (to &lt;more@extropy.org&gt;) or by phoning (310) 398-0375<br>
<p>
Please note that I will be leaving later this morning to head north for the<br>
Foresight Institute meeting, and so will be away from my email until late<br>
on Sunday. Any questions about the running of the two lists can be<br>
addressed to ExI's Electronic Communications Officer David McFadzean<br>
&lt;david@lucifer.com&gt;.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
