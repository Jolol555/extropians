Would the present government allow such a trading society? It would be<br>
completely out of their control, and therefore a grave threat.<br>

This is especially true in engineering departments. 15 years ago, even<br>
engineering techs had draftsmen, secretaries to type up letters and reports,<br>
and file clerks to do the day-to-day drudge work. Modern computers have<br>
eliminated most of these positions and piled the responsibilities on the<br>
engineers, who now use their own PCs to type letters, do detail drawings,<br>
manage paperwork, etc. Also, they are now expected to design and deliver new<br>
products in less time than when they had a team of assistants.<br>
<p>
With this increased responsibility has come a slight decline in the real<br>
purchasing power of their wages..not to mention layoffs when they reach the<br>
top of the pay scale, and loss of many once 'sacred' benefits.<br>
