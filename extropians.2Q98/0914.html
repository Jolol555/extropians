Several recent interesting posts sent me scrambling through a dusty old<br>
pile of my magazine tear-sheets, whence I dug out an article I published in<br>
an Australian mass market magazine in October 1967 - is it possible to be<br>
so ancient? surely not - entitled whimsically `If there is no God, who<br>
pulls up the next Kleenex?'  Diverting to see what curious intimations of<br>
transhumanism were afloat in those dim lost days...<br>
<p>
==================<br>
<p>
...biblical religion... simply is not hooked into the dynamo of our age.<br>
It is too firmly entrenched in patterns of thought and emotional response<br>
long superannuated; it has a weight of centuries on it.  Stripped to<br>
fighting weight, it comes out punchy, its jab is short and feeble and<br>
directed at shadows painted on its own eyes.<br>
<p>
Yet there remains that brooding violence in our culture's belly, the large<br>
reality which magic and religion, before our day,  handled not<br>
unsuccessfully.  Perhaps, with Julian Huxley, we can call it *the divine*,<br>
the latent potency which is not supernatural but *transnatural*.  It is, I<br>
suggest, the same coiled spring which drove primitive man, in a fury of<br>
invention, to build gods as its representation.  It is the subterranean<br>
torrent of dread and exultation which is the twin realisation of our<br>
blurred insignificance before the towering presence of the universe and our<br>
inevitable personal extinction, and the full, rich, scarcely-glimpsed<br>
flowering of human possibilities.<br>
<p>
Here, perhaps, is the central existential reality we must neither<br>
propitiate nor ignore, but embrace.  It finds a statement in Huxley's<br>
scientific panorama: "This new vision is both comprehensive and unitary.<br>
It integrates the fantastic diversity of the world into a single framework,<br>
the pattern of all-embracing evlutionary process." [...]<br>
<p>
There seems, as I mentioned at the beginning, to be something ludicrous in<br>
the assertion that our having relinquished religion might be the betrayal<br>
of our civilisation to vast undirected energies.  Yet it is not<br>
implausible.  In casting off a belief in God "which has ceased to be<br>
scientifically tenable, has lost its explanatory value, and is becoming an<br>
intellectual and moral burden to our thought", we have carelessly lost<br>
sight of the divine which ante-dated gods.<br>
<p>
Norman Mailer has spoken of the plight of our time, that our world "reduces<br>
one's sense of reality by reducing to the leaden formulations of jargon<br>
such emotions as awe, dread, beauty, pity, terror, calm, horror and<br>
harmony", that it "leaves us further isolated in the empty landscapes of<br>
psychosis, precisely that inner landscape of void and dread which we flee".<br>
<p>
And yet it may not have to be that way.  "Maybe we are in a sense the seed,<br>
the seed-carriers, the voyagers, the explorers...; maybe we are engaged in<br>
a heroic activity, and not a mean one".<br>
<p>
=======================<br>
<p>
More than three decades later I would distance myself from the last wisps<br>
of teleology and crypto-religiosity in that piece.  Still, perhaps it<br>
catches a moment (perhaps shared by FM-2030 in another part of the world at<br>
around the same time) when we started to see the plausibility - indeed, the<br>
inevitability - of a transhumanist trajectory.<br>
<p>
(Incidentally, some of that old article was later recycled in my 1982 sf<br>
novel *The Judas Mandala*, with its explicitly transhuman cyborgs, virtual<br>
realiy, and Tiplerian Omega-mind.)<br>
