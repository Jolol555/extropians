<i>&gt; I've spent a lot of time reading in parapsychology, good, bad and</i><br>

<i>&gt; precognition.  My current best guess is that some claims of psi are valid,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that the record clearly shows that veridical non-inferential</i><br>
<i>&gt; foreknowledge is possible (although in a vagrant, transient and</i><br>
<i>&gt; irritatingly stochastic fashion).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most of the rational posters on this list will be horrified by this</i><br>
<i>&gt; declaration, and I don't blame them.  Luckily, there are convenient sources</i><br>
<i>&gt; of information about this apparently absurd and New Ageish claim.  Right</i><br>
<i>&gt; now I'm reading a quite good generalist 1997 book on the topic by Dean</i><br>
<i>&gt; Radin, PhD, with the unfortunate catch-penny title THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Harper Edge).  Even more unfortunately, the art dept has a floating - but</i><br>
<i>&gt; unbent - sugar spoon on the cover, despite Radin's explicit decision *not*</i><br>
<i>&gt; to discuss Geller's exploded claims in his book.  The great merit of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; treatment is a lucid account of various recent meta-analyses of many</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundreds of parapsychological experiments, which together provide effect</i><br>
<i>&gt; sizes on the order of that demonstrated by aspirin against cardiac disease.</i><br>
<p>
I have heard of similar meta-analyses in the past, where they combine<br>
results from a large number of studies.  A percentage effect which is<br>
not statistically significant at a small scale becomes significant with<br>
a sufficiently large amount of data.<br>
<p>
I would feel better if a single study, done with iron-clad protocols,<br>
replicable, could be done at a large enough scale to demonstrate the<br>
phenomenon at a strongly significant level.  This technique of aggregation<br>
of multiple small studies, each with different methodology, will never<br>
be as convincing.<br>
<p>
One problem with psi phenomena is that their behavior seems so much<br>
more like fraud and error than like a physical effect.  The magnitude of<br>
the phenomenon tends to be independent of the common-sense difficulty.<br>
Seeing around the world isn't any harder than seeing into the room<br>
next door.  Foretelling events a few seconds away is no easier than<br>
foretelling things which will happen hours or days later.<br>
