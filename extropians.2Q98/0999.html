DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF INTELLIGENCE<br>
<p>
Innate intelligence -- rather than environmental and social <br>
factors -- largely determines how much people will earn, claims <br>
Charles Murray in a new report from the American Enterprise <br>
Institute.  <br>
<p>
His findings, contained in the study "Income Inequality and IQ," <br>
are based on an analysis of 2,859 young adult sibling pairs.  The <br>
pairs were raised in the same home and had the same parents, but <br>
their Intelligence Quotients (IQs) differed.<br>
<p>
   o   "Very bright" siblings, with IQs above 120, earned a <br>
       median of $33,500 a year -- $11,500 more than their <br>
       "normal" siblings, whose IQs ranged between 90 and 109.<br>
<p>
   o   "Normal" siblings earned a median of $9,750 more than <br>
       their "very dull" siblings, whose IQs were less than 80 <br>
       and who had median earnings of $7,500.<br>
<p>
   o   Wondering what would happen to siblings if the very best <br>
       social advantages were introduced, Murray set up a <br>
       "utopian" sample -- siblings who spent 14 years in an <br>
       intact family with median earnings of $50,000 a year.<br>
<p>
   o   The "utopian" siblings' earnings remained stratified by IQ <br>
       and were only slightly higher than their counterparts in <br>
       the general study.<br>
<p>
The one exception was for "very dull" siblings.  Those who grew <br>
up in ideal settings earned 47 percent more than those who did <br>
not.<br>
<p>
The top IQ group in the study earned almost five times as much as <br>
the bottom group.<br>
<p>
The study points out the nearly insurmountable difficulties <br>
involved in trying to eradicate income inequality.<br>
<p>
Murray was the coauthor of the 1994 book, "The Bell Curve: <br>
Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life," written with <br>
the late Richard Herrnstein. <br>
