A Matter Of Hearts <br>
==================<br>
<p>
An intimate look at the illicit affair that has pitted the vagaries of love<br>
against the unsentimentality of the law <br>
<p>
By JOHN CLOUD /SEATTLE <br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
<p>
  Mary K. Letourneau sat on the steps in front of her home, staring west<br>
across a glorious sunset over Puget Sound. Inside with a friend was baby<br>
Audrey Lokelani, Mary's fifth child and her first with Vili Fualaau, the<br>
teenager she has become so infamous for loving. It was a breezy summer's<br>
eve, and she could smell the fresh-cut grass on her lawn. She squinted into<br>
a blazing horizon. "I had a dream last night," she said, speaking to a<br>
neighbor. "I dreamed I was sitting here watching the sunset. And I sat<br>
there and sat there, but the sun just wouldn't set." <br>
<p>
That was last summer, before her life spun completely out of control,<br>
before it was again and again on Oprah and Dateline and Geraldo, before it<br>
was retold (and often mistold) in papers from the New York Times to the<br>
tabloids. Letourneau's relationship with Vili, who turns 15 in June, as<br>
well as her conviction and imprisonment, have drawn international<br>
attention. The BBC has come to Seattle to film a documentary. Her image has<br>
been an alluring paradox: at once darling suburban teacher and predatory<br>
monster; so blond, so pretty, so...dangerous to children? She is more<br>
complicated, of course, and soon several magazines will render her in<br>
brushstrokes instead of spray paint. But even here there is haste:<br>
Mirabella and Spin rushed out advance copies of their articles last week to<br>
preview salacious disclosures. Letourneau, in jail but hardly<br>
incommunicado, expected less trumpeting and more deliberation, since she<br>
had cooperated closely with both writers. For their part, the Fualaaus have<br>
sold the story and pictures of Vili to a tabloid, the Globe, for more than<br>
$20,000. Their decision was understandable--the family has struggled<br>
financially, and a radio host had already identified Vili early in the<br>
week--but even as it ran his picture, the paper labeled him the "boy she<br>
raped." When Mary sees it, she will think it a bit tacky. <br>
<p>
She considers herself the victim of a collision of law and love. But if<br>
Mary Letourneau is a complex character in a complicated situation, is she<br>
any less guilty? Her new lawyer--a hotshot New Englander with an accent and<br>
a Ph.D.--is concocting an appeal in secret. More disclosures are sure to<br>
come, and several books are in the works. But could a mountain of paper<br>
make what she did O.K.? Is there any way to defend Mary? The key may lie in<br>
the meanderings of her heart. <br>
<p>
There was a moment last year when Letourneau had some time to start a<br>
journal for Audrey so that when the little girl is older, she can<br>
understand this mess. At that time, last summer, the future didn't look so<br>
bleak to Letourneau. She was still talking to her other four children, her<br>
"angels," even though they were moving to Alaska with their dad Steven.<br>
True, her lawyer, David Gehrke, was telling her she had to plead guilty to<br>
"rape of a child." Such a ridiculous charge, she thought. Why couldn't<br>
everyone realize that Vili had come on to her for months? But Dave and his<br>
wife Susan were friends from the neighborhood, good people who assured her<br>
that Dave had obtained a good deal--a few months in jail, then a treatment<br>
program for "sex offenders." Another annoying term, Mary thought. She was<br>
still imagining a life with all five of her kids together as a family. She<br>
and Steve would divorce, but perhaps she and Vili--a sensitive, dreamy soul<br>
who had, to her surprise, become the love of her life--could wed. To this<br>
day, Mary likes to see the bright side. <br>
<p>
Within weeks of these musings, brutal reality set in. In August, Letourneau<br>
was taken into custody; in November, she was sentenced to seven years and<br>
five months in prison for having sex with Vili. And though Judge Linda Lau<br>
initially suspended the sentence, her leniency imposed an impossible<br>
condition: Letourneau must not have contact with Vili. In February, Lau<br>
learned that police had caught Mary and Vili together. Livid, she reimposed<br>
the sentence and sent Letourneau to prison. <br>
<p>
The February episode looked much worse than it was, say those who really<br>
know Mary and Vili. The two were caught in her car in the dead of night<br>
with wads of cash and Mary's passport. Outsiders thought they planned to<br>
race off to a country that would allow them to marry, but the boring truth<br>
was that they had gone to see Wag the Dog and get some food and beer. As<br>
romantic and manic as Mary can be, she never planned to flee with Vili. To<br>
where? And take him from his mother, the one person who has been sane and<br>
humane throughout all this? No. <br>
<p>
Though Mary and Vili kissed and touched, they mainly talked that night. He<br>
needed to vent. He was a normal kid with school pressures, three older<br>
siblings, a hard-working mom and a dad in prison, and now--he still<br>
couldn't believe it sometimes--a baby. Vili has had trouble at school, and<br>
he was arrested on a minor robbery charge last year. Few people listened.<br>
Letourneau, his soul mate, was one. <br>
<p>
Before they were caught in the car, they had violated Lau's condition<br>
several times. They met to go to the movies, to try to make sense of their<br>
predicament, and, yes, to have sex. Titanic made their spirits take flight<br>
and their libidos surge--forbidden love, a terrible tragedy, a soaring<br>
sound track. According to the Globe, Vili even sketched Mary in the nude, a<br>
la Jack and Rose. <br>
<p>
But if truth is stranger than fiction, it is, in this instance, also<br>
harsher. Mary, 37, is pregnant again, and her and Vili's second child, when<br>
it is born, will be Exhibit A in the likely case that the local prosecutor<br>
will bring fresh charges of rape against her. Though she has persuaded her<br>
prison keepers that she is ill enough to stay in the infirmary--which is<br>
equipped with a phone that she uses constantly--prison is still a terrible<br>
place to be pregnant. The appeal of her original case will take weeks just<br>
to plan, weeks more to be heard, weeks more to be decided. Susan Howards,<br>
her Boston-based appellate lawyer, has been to Seattle only once, for a few<br>
hours. Months, years could pass. Mary is due to give birth to another angel<br>
in the fall, and within 48 hours, a state law enforcer will take the child<br>
from her. <br>
<p>
Vili Fualaau is a rather big teen but not a muscular hulk. He has recently<br>
experimented with a mustache, and it's a little wispy. His voice has<br>
deepened, and he's now about 5 ft. 8 in. His appeal is more Leonardo<br>
DiCaprio than Ben Affleck, but mostly he's an average kid--which is to say,<br>
he's extraordinary in his own way. Born in Hawaii to parents who emigrated<br>
from Western Samoa, he loves art and music, and when strangers come by to<br>
meet him--and many, many strangers want to meet him these days--he and Mom<br>
Soona usually begin by showing them his artwork. He draws allegorical<br>
cartoons, zany characters with deeper meanings. Later this month Spin will<br>
run a sample depicting Mary's courtroom as a circus where Fear is the<br>
central, spear-wielding character. <br>
<p>
Some friends call him Buddha, and Soona has often called Vili "an old soul<br>
trapped in a young body." He has always seemed mature. In sixth grade, a<br>
couple of years ago, while classmates were writing poems that described<br>
themselves as lovers of "girls, baseball, ice cream...and MTV," Vili wrote<br>
that he was a "Lover of giving, faith, trust...Who likes to wear masks over<br>
his soul." He was just 12. <br>
<p>
That is the Vili that Mary fell in love with. She had met him years before,<br>
in her second-grade class, and quickly noticed his talents. He had noticed<br>
her too, and he flirted with her throughout sixth grade. Kids get crushes<br>
on teachers all the time--and, of course, most are rebuffed--but Letourneau<br>
had entered a fragile period. In October 1995, her father, retired G.O.P.<br>
Congressman John Schmitz, had disclosed his terminal cancer. As Mary later<br>
told a psychiatrist, she felt he had died already. "She felt she died too,"<br>
says Dr. Julie Tybor Moore. Her father has always been a rock, even during<br>
his own public whipping. In 1982, an extramarital affair was revealed when<br>
his mistress (a former college student of his) brought one of their two<br>
children to a hospital after the child was injured in an accident. The<br>
hospital requested the father's name, and Schmitz--a church-and-family<br>
conservative--then watched his political career wilt. <br>
<p>
Family was always important to Mary; now hers seemed to be disintegrating.<br>
She had been a superteacher, hauling her own kids to her classroom after<br>
dinner so she could chat and play as she finished special projects. But<br>
after learning about her father's illness, she withdrew, declining to take<br>
on a student teacher and saying no to some Girl Scout duties. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, she and Steve were growing distant. They had always been a bit<br>
oddly paired: she the literary romantic, he the frat boy at Arizona State,<br>
where they met in the early '80s. She got pregnant not long after meeting<br>
him, and she married like the good Catholic she has always tried to be. But<br>
by the early '90s, it was clear to friends that even their four children<br>
weren't going to hold Steve and Mary Letourneau together. Expenses outpaced<br>
salaries--Steve loads cargo for Alaska Airlines--and creditors were<br>
phoning. They filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 1994. <br>
<p>
An inner circle of Mary's friends, a troika who have requested anonymity<br>
even as they talk among themselves of a "campaign" to burnish Mary's public<br>
image, insist that Steve was having affairs and abusing Mary, mostly<br>
verbally but with an occasional shove. (Steve Letourneau and his lawyer<br>
turned down several interview requests.) It got to the point that they were<br>
barely civil. Therapist Moore says Mary remembered that when she told Steve<br>
about her father's cancer, he growled, "What do you want me to do?" <br>
<p>
Moore believes that Mary has bipolar disorder--most people know it as manic<br>
depression--an illness with a raft of possible symptoms, from irritability<br>
to hypersexuality. Moore theorizes that "psychosocial stressors" in Mary's<br>
life--the most crucial being the news of her father's cancer--tipped a<br>
disorder that had been mild and all but unnoticed into depression followed<br>
by a nervous breakdown. "I think she was very interested in this boy, and<br>
she had often extended relationships with students after school," Moore<br>
says. "But by [June 1996], she was overly elated, highly revved up and<br>
nearly delusional." Moore notes, "The father had always been the man in her<br>
life--and even the husband was for a time--but then she really began to see<br>
this boy as the man in her life." <br>
<p>
Mary has never fully accepted Moore's diagnosis, and her friends disagree<br>
over its accuracy and importance. For their part, prosecutors think she's<br>
more evil than ill. Whatever her true state, in June 1996, she and Vili<br>
became more than close friends. He had stayed at her house many times<br>
before. Soona was working nights making pastries, and she thought the<br>
sleepovers at Mrs. Letourneau's were healthy for Vili. But he had begun<br>
writing Mary romantic poems, and at some point openly asked her to have<br>
sex. She declined at first. <br>
<p>
Then, just after midnight on June 19, Steve and Mary were at home arguing,<br>
tossing threats and denunciations around as usual. Vili was there, but he<br>
left amid the fighting. Mary eventually followed him in the van, picked him<br>
up and drove to the marina in a suburb called Des Moines. Her van crept<br>
around the parking lot as they looked for a place to stop, and a security<br>
guard watched it run over a curb. Suspecting a drunk driver, he called the<br>
cops. <br>
<p>
When they arrived, Officers Rich Niebusch and Bob Tschida couldn't quite<br>
figure out what they were dealing with. They shone a spotlight into the<br>
back window, and a startled Mary jumped from under the covers she and Vili<br>
were sharing and into the driver's seat. She at first lied and said her<br>
companion was 18, and Vili pretended to be asleep. But the officers<br>
questioned him and learned his age. He had just turned 13. Even as Mary<br>
tried to explain herself--there was a fight with my husband; we were just<br>
sleeping; I often watch Vili--they were concerned enough to call in a<br>
sergeant. After all, Mary was clad in a coat and T shirt but "was<br>
bare-legged below the T shirt," Tschida wrote in a report. The sergeant who<br>
arrived later reported that she was wearing a beige skirt. Regardless of<br>
this, it didn't look good, and Vili told the Globe that he and Mary had, in<br>
fact, been "close" to having sex that night. <br>
<p>
Somehow, no one beyond the police discovered just how bad it looked. The<br>
cops called Soona, but Fualaau family lawyer Robert Huff says they spoke<br>
with her "for half a minute" before allowing Mary to tell Soona a G-rated<br>
version of the incident. "Mary's a great talker," Huff says, "and Soona<br>
calmed down." Soona then told the police it was O.K. for Vili to go home<br>
with Mary; for reasons that aren't clear, the police didn't press the<br>
issue. They never informed Mary's school, and they decided there wasn't<br>
enough evidence to file charges. <br>
<p>
"I think our people went out of their way and followed good protocol on<br>
this," says Des Moines police commander Kevin Tucker. "You know, when they<br>
were talking to the mom and she was saying it was O.K., then basically<br>
there were no signs of criminal activity." In hindsight, of course, there<br>
was every sign: a Washington State statute clearly defines sex with a minor<br>
between the ages of 12 and 16 as rape. <br>
<p>
Over the summer, Mary and Vili were able to live out their love. Steve<br>
always worked a lot--he and Mary were still paying into a court-approved<br>
bankruptcy plan and had a hard time meeting mortgage payments. He was used<br>
to seeing Vili around anyway. The teenager told the Globe that he and Mary<br>
had sex in nearly every room of the house. <br>
<p>
In the fall, Mary realized she was pregnant. She and Steve hadn't had much<br>
sex in the previous few months, and the baby was definitely Vili's. Steve<br>
was by then very suspicious of the amount of time his wife and her student<br>
were spending together. When he learned that Mary was pregnant and that<br>
Vili was the father, Steve was enraged. Gehrke and Huff, who works as both<br>
the Fualaaus' lawyer and as Mary's media representative, say Steve ranted<br>
about "that n_____ baby" in front of their children. He even confronted his<br>
13-year-old rival, demanding to know if he was having sex with Mary. Vili<br>
said yes. <br>
<p>
The Letourneaus were in hell. Steve wasn't sure what to do. Take his<br>
children from their mother? In the end, a relative of his called Mary's<br>
school district anonymously. School officials immediately phoned the cops,<br>
who questioned Vili the next morning. He told the truth, and later that<br>
day, in February 1997, the school principal called Mary out of a faculty<br>
meeting. A detective was waiting to arrest her. <br>
<p>
In the long months that she waited to plead guilty (last summer) and be<br>
sentenced (in November), Mary and Steve barely spoke. According to Spin,<br>
she had to sleep in the car outside their home because she was under court<br>
orders not to live in the same house as children, even her own. In a series<br>
of interviews with the TV tabloid show American Journal, Steve said he<br>
cried often during this period and his children were confused and<br>
devastated. <br>
<p>
According to police reports, on May 9, Mary told police that Steve hit her<br>
in the stomach and said, "We want to see the law bury you, and it can't<br>
happen too soon." The officer found a large red mark on her stomach. Steve<br>
was gone, and Mary didn't want to press charges, so the cops left. But Mary<br>
told police that Steve returned that night drunk. As they were talking, he<br>
pulled away in the car quickly, allegedly knocking her hard to the ground.<br>
She was eight months pregnant with Audrey. A neighbor took her to the<br>
hospital. <br>
<p>
Her debacle got little attention at first, but after Mary did some<br>
interviews with a local paper last summer, her attractive face and quixotic<br>
mien changed that. Soon many images of Mary--some of her own creation, most<br>
drawn by others--were emerging. There was the weepy, repentant Mary at her<br>
original sentencing. "Help us. Help us all," she begged the judge. Moore<br>
believes this was "the real Mary," brought back to reality by Depakote, a<br>
mood stabilizer. Others suggest it was a ruse (successful) to win leniency.<br>
<p>
<p>
But soon enough, Gehrke's hard-won deal didn't look so good. The "Special<br>
Sex Offender Sentencing Alternative" required Mary to tell her kids that<br>
Mommy was a rapist. How could she do that? From behind the scenes, the<br>
image of a truculent, unrepentant Mary then emerged. She stopped taking the<br>
Depakote--her doctor approved, wrongly thinking she would quickly change to<br>
lithium, another medication used to treat bipolar disorder--and started<br>
telling friends that she and Vili were truly in love. "Since when do people<br>
who love each other have to defend it?" she would ask. She quarreled with<br>
her court-approved treatment counselor, Terry Copeland, who in 15 years had<br>
never seen a sex offender in his care return to prison for committing<br>
another sex offense. He has counseled more than 400. <br>
<p>
Reporters were creating images of her too, some that Mary disputes. In his<br>
forthcoming piece in Mirabella, Jim Fielder includes an account by a<br>
court-appointed counselor of an incestuous relationship involving Mary and<br>
one of her three brothers. Mary has told friends that the counselor who<br>
wrote this evaluation wildly exaggerated the truth, which was that in an<br>
innocent childhood exploration, she had once touched a brother's penis. She<br>
has told friends she hopes to sue the counselor. Friends say Letourneau is<br>
also angry with Fielder, claiming he not only interviewed her under false<br>
pretenses (she believed he was writing a screenplay) but also took copies<br>
of her psychiatric evaluations from Julie Terry, a close friend with power<br>
of attorney for Mary. Mirabella editor in chief Roberta Myers denied all<br>
the allegations Friday, saying Terry, in fact, gave Fielder the documents. <br>
<p>
What's next for Letourneau? New lawyer Howards has to devise an appeals<br>
strategy, which won't be easy. Washington State has led the nation in<br>
aggressively prosecuting sex criminals, and Howards starts out knowing<br>
little about Washington law. She made her name in Boston by helping win the<br>
release of a group of women who had murdered their abusive husbands. But<br>
Mary has told friends that she doesn't think the abuse she has accused<br>
Steve of should be part of the public debate. She is disappointed that<br>
Gehrke pinned her defense on her bipolar condition, and she doesn't want it<br>
emphasized. She will almost certainly claim in an appeal that Gehrke did a<br>
poor job. <br>
<p>
Letourneau believes that Gehrke could have sought a deal for her under a<br>
molestation rather than rape statute, one carrying a maximum penalty of 15<br>
months rather than 89 months. She has begun reminding people that Vili was<br>
the "aggressor" in their relationship and that without violence there can<br>
be no rape. But David Allen, a Seattle criminal-defense attorney, says,<br>
"Molestation is a different crime, involving touching or fondling. Rape of<br>
a child in Washington is defined as any penetration, however slight. It's<br>
age-driven, and who the aggressor is or whether it's consensual doesn't<br>
matter." <br>
<p>
Another long shot for Mary could be a claim that Vili raped her, since she<br>
was vulnerable and didn't have the will to resist his come-ons. So far,<br>
however, Mary has avoided putting any legal burdens on her young lover.<br>
Meanwhile, her friends and lawyers are bickering about how to proceed. The<br>
infighting has worsened in the past few weeks. Howards has tried,<br>
unsuccessfully, to get them all to shut up, and she is the only one who<br>
isn't talking. <br>
<p>
Unless Howards works a miracle, Mary K. Letourneau will leave prison in<br>
2005. Vili will be 21. Though the judge ordered Mary never to see him again<br>
for the rest of her life, it's hard to imagine her complying. On the other<br>
hand, seven years is an eternity for a teenager to wait for a girl. Even<br>
so, Vili says he will. "No matter how long I have to wait," he told the<br>
Globe, "I'll be there because our love is so special that nothing can stand<br>
in its way." So far, almost everything has stood in its way. <br>
