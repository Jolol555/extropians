I'm not saying you do benefit from having competitors.  Indeed, it's<br>
primarily us consumers who benefit from your competition.  However, even<br>
without copyright, all firms benefit from invention.  Suppose your firm is<br>
producing goods in a regular competitive economy with normal supply and<br>
demand curves:<br>
<p>
Price |\_           _/ &lt;-- supply<br>
<i>      |  \_       _/</i><br>
<i>      |    \_   _/</i><br>

      ----------------------<br>
              Q*<br>
           Quantity    <br>
<p>
We imagine that you make a variety of goods, and this demand curve<br>
represents the demand for all the different goods you might make in a<br>
competitive market.  OK, now suppose you invent something new.  The<br>
invention is a "sunk cost": it does not add to your marginal costs (see<br>
below) and so it does not change the shape of your supply curve.  (This may<br>
not necessarily be true; making a sensor may be more costly the other goods<br>
which you make currently, or it may be cheaper.  However, because the<br>
effect is ambiguous, we can presume that it doesn't change your supply<br>
curve.  Even if it does, this doesn't affect my argument.)  Nonetheless, it<br>
DOES increase the demand for your goods, since you now attract new buyers<br>
who want to buy your new product.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>      |\_</i><br>
<i>      |  \_</i><br>

      ---------------------------<br>
              Q*  Q**<br>
           Quantity    <br>
    <br>
Where P** and Q** are the new price and quantity.  As this graph shows, you<br>
reap increased revenues thanks to the invention, even under a market where<br>
you don't have copyright protection.  To be specific, you reap extra<br>
revenues given by the trapezoid formed by the y-axis, the old price line,<br>
the supply curve and the new price line.<br>
<p>
So what did I mean by externalities?  Well, just as your firm will receive<br>
the money in that trapezoid, so will all other firms who produce<br>
"knock-offs."  You will all EACH receive the quantity inside that<br>
trapezoid.  Thus, invention has positive externalities on other suppliers.  <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, it IS worthwhile to pay for invention, even if the invention is<br>
not protected with a government monopoly, if the area inside your trapezoid<br>
is equal to or greater than the cost of invention.  Indeed, the larger your<br>
stake in the market, the more worthwhile invention is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I set my prices arbitrarily high, I limit my sales to those for whom</i><br>
<i>&gt;money is no object. This is a very small market. If I charge a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;price for my invention, based on its' costs and a fair payment to me for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;development, I should have more takers.</i><br>
<p>
Let's look at what you're saying economically.<br>
<p>
You correctly point out that if you set the price arbitrarily high, you<br>
won't have as many takers as if you set the price somewhat lower.  I agree<br>
with this; monopolies do not get to set their own revenues, they only get<br>
to set the market price without worrying about competitors.  So we imagine<br>
that you demand curve looks like this:<br>
<p>
Price |\__                              <br>
<i>      |   \__               </i><br>
<i>      |      \__        </i><br>
<i>      |         \__                          </i><br>
<i>      |            \__       </i><br>
<i>      |               \__</i><br>
<i>      |                  \__</i><br>
<i>      |                      \  &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      -----------------------------<br>
                     <br>
             Quantity<br>
<p>
However, because you are the only source of this particular good, you<br>
represent the entire market for that good.  This means that each time you<br>
want to increase quantity by one, you have to lower the price slightly.  As<br>
a result, the marginal revenue (MR, or the revenue you get from selling one<br>
more of your product) for a monopoly is actually LOWER than the demand<br>
curve, and looks like this:<br>
<p>
Price |\__                              <br>
<i>      | \ \__               </i><br>
<i>      |  \   \__        </i><br>
<i>      |   \     \__                          </i><br>
<i>      |    \       \__       </i><br>
<i>      |     \         \__</i><br>
<i>      |      \           \__</i><br>
<i>      |       \ &lt;-- MR       \  &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      -----------------------------<br>
                     <br>
             Quantity<br>
<p>
Finally, we note that you suffer from increasing marginal cost; that is,<br>
the first sensor you make is cheaper than the second, which is cheaper than<br>
the third, and so on.  (This is not strictly true across the board; this<br>
value may remain level or even decline, but it is nonetheless true as a<br>
general trend.)  So your marginal cost (aka "supply") curve will look<br>
something like this:<br>
<p>
Price |\__                __/  &lt;--- supply<br>
<i>      | \ \__          __/  </i><br>
<i>      |  \   \__    __/ </i><br>
<i>      |   \     \__/                         </i><br>
<i>      |    \  __/  \__       </i><br>
<i>      |    _\/        \__</i><br>
<i>      | __/  \           \__</i><br>
<i>      |/      \ &lt;-- MR       \  &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      -----------------------------<br>
                     <br>
             Quantity<br>
<p>
The profit maximization rule for firms state that you should continue to<br>
produce goods until your marginal costs are equal to or greater than your<br>
marginal revenue; in order words, that you should make one more if the cost<br>
of one more is less than the revenues which it will make for you.  A normal<br>
firm will find this point when the supply curve intersects the demand<br>
curve, because for most firms, the demand curve IS the marginal revenue<br>
curve.  Monopolies, on the other hand, have a lower MR curve, and thus will<br>
set their quantity lower than a regular firm.  Unfortunately for consumers,<br>
however, the PRICE a monopoly can charge for a given quantity is given by<br>
the demand curve, not by the marginal revenue curve.  So what we see is<br>
that monopolies, when acting in such a way as to maximize their profits,<br>
will set prices higher than a competitive firm would, and produce a smaller<br>
quantity, thus:<br>
<p>
<p>
Price |\__                __/  &lt;--- supply<br>
    P |_\_\__          __/  <br>
<i>      |  \  |\__    __/ </i><br>
    P*|___\_|___\__/                         <br>
<i>      |    \| __/ |\__       </i><br>
<i>      |    _\/    |   \__</i><br>
<i>      | __/ |\    |      \__</i><br>
<i>      |/    | \   |          \  &lt;-- demand</i><br>
      -----------------------------<br>
            Q     Q* <br>
             Quantity<br>
<p>
<p>
Where P* and Q* are the price and quantity which would be reached by a free<br>
market, and P and Q are the price and quantity which a monopoly would<br>
choose to maximize profits.  (I recognize that it's hard to read...  Try<br>
drawing it on paper or something.)  When we keep in mind that the<br>
consumers' surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the price<br>
line, whereas the monopoly's surplus is the area above the supply curve and<br>
below the price line, it is clear that by setting the prices this high, the<br>
firms are benefitting at the expense of the consumers.  Worse, we also note<br>
that because this quantity is lower than it would be under a free market<br>
there is "deadweight loss" (the wealth which would have been created if the<br>
market were free), represented by the area inside the triangle bounded by<br>
the demand curve, the supply curve and the quantity line.  The part of this<br>
triangle above the price line is that surplus which would have been earned<br>
by consumers; the part below this triangle is that which would have been<br>
earned by firms.  Firms will happily sacrifice this triangle, however, if<br>
they can gain the rectangle formed by the y-axis, the monopoly price, the<br>
quantity line, and the competitive price.  The revenues in that rectangle<br>
outweigh the revenues in the triangle.<br>
<p>
This is why monopolies are bad:  they are REALLY bad for consumers, since<br>
they go from reaping the entire area under the demand curve and above the<br>
competitive price line to only getting the much smaller area below the<br>
demand curve and above the monopolistic price line.  Moreover, they are<br>
also bad for the wealth of society as a whole, because the deadweight loss<br>
represents commerce which COULD have contributed to economic growth for<br>
everybody, but won't, because the monopolistic firm is profit maximizing.<br>
<p>
So, to answer your point directly:  Yes, you won't set your price<br>
arbitrarily high; instead, you'll set your price just high enough to<br>
squeeze profits out of the consumers at the expense of everybody else,<br>
hurting everyone by hurting the consumers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the case of our products, the market is fairly small and specialized. One</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitior stealing our ideas and undercutting us would ruin the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;works for us.</i><br>
<p>
If your product isn't worth making under a competitive price, but is only<br>
worthwhile under government protection, maybe you should rethink whether<br>
the product is worth making at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;So it seems to me that we're choosing between an accidental good and,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;apparently, a deliberate bad.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I still don't see the 'bad'.</i><br>
<p>
I hope you do now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, it's darn hard to encrypt a mostly physical device..We don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;the replicator, yet..</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The encryption is used for the invention, for the sales of the first idea,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;not for the product.  The premise that you could have lots of people know a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;piece of information and still sell it as if you were the only one is one</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of the fallacies which copyright tends to prop up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The rewards are for the initial creation of the information, not knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;of same. You seem to be saying that the creators deserve no rewards for</i><br>
<i>&gt;their thinking!</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand what you're saying here.  As you surely know if you've<br>
read my other posts on this topic, I DO think that creaters deserve rewards<br>
for inventing, I just don't think they deserve monopoly status on the idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You still benefit from the invention in the form of the new market you've</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;just created or in the increased demand for your products.  The fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;your competitor will also benefit does not detract from this.  Thus, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;long as you still make a profit from the invention, it's still worthwhile</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to pay for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I beg to differ. As I stated earlier, if the market is small, you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;seriously harmed by knock-off competetion.</i><br>
<p>
Again, if you need the coerced profits in the rectangle in order to stay<br>
afloat, then maybe you should be rethinking the value of your product in<br>
general.  And as I think I have shown, you DO benefit from invention, even<br>
when other people are allowed to compete with you for your products.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you build a mansion, will you be disturbed if I decide to move in with my</i><br>
<i>&gt;family and use it? If not, let me know where you live...</i><br>
<p>
Of course I would be.  I would not be at all disturbed, however, if you<br>
made another mansion just like it on your own land.  This is the difference<br>
between "intellectual property" and real property.<br>
