<p>
 My impression is that many people want an increasing standard of living.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Why did the average wage in the US  steadily decrease from 1971 to</i><br>
<i>&gt;1996?</i><br>
<p>
 I did a hasty search for data to check this claim, and found the following<br>
(from the St. Louis Fed, <a href="http://www.stls.frb.org/fred/">http://www.stls.frb.org/fred/</a>):<br>
<p>
eciwag -- Employment Cost Index-Wages: Private Industry Workers (SA, 8906=100)       <br>
  DATE    ECIWAG<br>
<p>
1980.1      63.1<br>
...<br>
1998.1     133.6<br>
<p>
 I didn't find any wage data earlier than 1980. Since it appears unadjusted<br>
for inflation, I checked the CPI for the comparable period:<br>
1980.01       78.0 <br>
...<br>
1998.03      162.0 <br>
<p>
 This sure looks inconsistent with your claim.<br>
<p>
 Even if you have some data which tell a slightly different story, I<br>
don't think that has much implication for which political system is<br>
best. Automation has been going on for something like 2 centuries, and<br>
if you use all the worldwide data to compare how the average person has<br>
fared, you will see a clear correlation that favors relatively capitalist<br>
countries.<br>

<p>
 The increased volume of uninteresting posts on this list has caused<br>
my reading habits to be less carefull than they used to be. I try to<br>
keep this habit from affecting how I read posts that I reply to, but<br>
I doubt that I done a perfect job of that.<br>
 I suspect that the declining S/N ratio has also driven away some of the<br>
people who were most carefull about how they read. If current trends<br>
continue, I'll probably leave the list in a few months.<br>
