<i>&gt;&gt; the patent owner can..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It doesn't prevent me from developing my own /unique/ creations,</i><br>
<i>&gt;where "unique" is defined as "sufficiently different and unobvious</i><br>
<i>&gt;to merit copyright or patent under the present system".  What it</i><br>
<i>&gt;prevents is I and others making small incremental improvements or</i><br>
<i>&gt;customizations to creative works.  I can't build a Dodge Neon with</i><br>
<i>&gt;a little better stereo; I can't produce a good German translation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a book I like, even if I'd do a much better job than whoever</i><br>
<i>&gt;the author chooses to hire--if he hires anyone at all.  I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;make a braille edition of a magazine without negotiating with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;copyright holder.  I can't make a college textbook with extensive</i><br>
<i>&gt;excerpts from classic novels (only short "fair use" excerpts).</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can't make wallpaper based on a popular piece of art.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Now you are starting to get to a level I can empathize with. Incremental<br>
improvements are important, and mostly ignored by our present systems. What<br>
needs to be protected against, perhaps not by law, is the 'unfair' use of<br>
creations that actively harm the orignal creator. This would be analogous to<br>
present slander or libel laws.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Copyrights is based on the myth of the lone inventor--the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;that creative works spring full-born from the mind of a single</i><br>
<i>&gt;creator.  In reality, there is no such thing as "creation" from</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing.  All inventors and authors draw from a pool of public</i><br>
<i>&gt;domain ideas and recombine and modify them in interesting ways.</i><br>
<i>&gt;With copyright law, only those modifications that pass an arbitrary</i><br>
<i>&gt;bar of "uniqueness" are able to get to market, regardless of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;inherent value.  Small, incremental improvements to things--which</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be the majority of works without copyright--aren't made,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which results in a decline of both quality and quanitity of work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;When all creators are free to do those small things they do best</i><br>
<i>&gt;without lawyers in the way, really great works can be created. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
There has not been a full blown 'invention' by that definition since the Big<br>
Bang. Obviously, nothing in this world stands alone. Any idea you or I can<br>
formulate is colored by our life experiences and readings.<br>
<p>
This does not answer the basic question. Should I be able to profit from my<br>
own labors? If I write a novel, I should be able to market it without having<br>
to worry about someone else taking my work, adding an introduction, and<br>
selling it at much less than my publisher's costs, thereby destroying my<br>
market. If I create a logo for my enterprise, should someone else be<br>
permitted to use it to sell their products? This is socialism you are<br>
talking about - the creators only live to hand out their lifeblood to the<br>
proles.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Even so, the free market will evolve protections analogous to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; patents and trademarks. It is inevitable that rules of some sort</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; will be made to prevent theft and fraud.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some creators will go to great lengths to use encryption and</i><br>
<i>&gt;contracts and other means to guard their works--and they will</i><br>
<i>&gt;suffer for it.  That's their problem.  As long as they do it in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the free market, let them.  Also, I have no problem with laws</i><br>
<i>&gt;against actual fraud--for example, producing a work by someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;else and claiming it is yours.  I suspect, though, that what you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are calling "theft" here is merely the use of others' ideas, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is only "theft" by definition, not reality.  Copyright law</i><br>
<i>&gt;is what mistakenly attributes the concept of "property" to ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt;that are no such thing, and I reject such argument-by-definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;as meaningless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree that sometimes too much 'its MINE!' is a bad thing. Apple tried this<br>
with a closed architecture, and suffered loss of sales to the IBM clones<br>
which had a much richer array of second source vendors. Even though the IBM<br>
PC was not a closed system, they still retained the rights to their logo,<br>
case designs, etc. People who made aftermarket add-in boards still kept the<br>
ownership of their individual designs. At no time was anyone prohibited from<br>
designing a new and better peripheral by the existence of their predecessors. <br>
Other bus architectures have been designed. Those which were closely guarded<br>
were less successful than those which were allowed to become public domain.<br>
The boards that plug into these buses, however, need the protection of<br>
patents and copyrights for reasons I have stated elsewhere, so the creators<br>
have a chance to recover their costs of creation. It's a matter of degree. A<br>
'bus' is a fairly trivial thing. An image processor is not. The creators of<br>
the open buses allowed them into the public domain to stimulate the demaind<br>
for their proprietary boards, and the competition is healthy.<br>
<p>
Anyone who hangs too tightly to their creations will not benefit from them;<br>
neither will the world. But saying that ideas and their physical embodiments<br>
are not the property of the thinker and inventor certainly does nothing to help.<br>
<p>
I have no objection to others using my ideas to act as a springboard for<br>
them to reach even greater heights. I only object to others using my<br>
creations to deny me a chance to make a living by undercutting me with<br>
duplicates of what I made.<br>
<p>
After all, if they can concieve of a better way to do what I am doing,<br>
surely I can use their take on the matter to leapfrog them..<br>
<p>
Copying, however, is cheating. By your arguments, if I copy your doctoral<br>
thesis, I should be able to claim the degree just as if I had done all the<br>
research. After all, it's not 'theft'..<br>
