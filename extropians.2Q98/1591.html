I posted last year about a set of predictions by the "resident futurist"<br>
at British Telecom labs, at:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://btlabs1.labs.bt.com/library/on-line/calendar/index.htm">http://btlabs1.labs.bt.com/library/on-line/calendar/index.htm</a><br>
<p>
They are sorted by technology and then by date within categories.<br>
Unfortunately there is no accompanying discussion or justification,<br>
which is a shame since the dates he gives seem implausibly optimistic.<br>
<p>
For example, in 1998 in the biotech/medical field he predicts the use of<br>
artificial muscle in heart transplants; home diagnostic systems with<br>
daily health check-up; virtual reality based exercisers in homes; AI<br>
based elderly/handicapped support devices; and an artificial pancreas.<br>
By 2000 he further predicts artificial blood; disability assistance<br>
devices using thought recognition; full personal medical records stored<br>
on smart cards; and artificial ears.<br>
<p>
I won't say he's going to be wrong about all of these, but I'd be surprised<br>
if more than one or two of these nine items occured in the predicted time<br>
frame.<br>
