Intersexuals are defined chromosomally as neither 'male' nor<br>
'female', some are further defined as 'true hermaphrodites'. Further<br>
medical info can be found at the Intersex Society of North America's<br>
excellent web site: <a href="http://www.isna.org">http://www.isna.org</a><br>
<p>
Erin was trying to find out if the number of intersex individuals<br>
being born had indeed increased, at least in the US--it's impossible<br>
to say without reviewing every single person's medical records, which<br>
are, of course, confidential.  A Medline search going back into the<br>
early 1980's reveals many surgeons crowing about having found 'true<br>
hermaphrodites', and how they fixed them (grrr....).  In a few<br>
cases, surgery was required to avert a life-threatening condition,<br>
but many of these kids were being operated on without the parent's<br>
knowledge or consent.  The criteria: surgical ease of changing the<br>
'anamolous' genitals to those of a male or female, to hell with the<br>
kid's identity.  <br>
<p>
Only one followup study has ever been conducted, and it just began a<br>
couple of years ago at Johns Hopkins.  Already, even before compiling<br>
and publishing results, the researcher says that several of the kids<br>
changed gender identity away from the one they were assigned upon<br>
reaching puberty.  To him, this provides evidence that sex identity<br>
lies more in the brain and should not be forced at a young age. <br>
