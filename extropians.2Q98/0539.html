<i>        &gt;I was remembering Acton's dictum about all power tending to corrupt;         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and absolute power tending to corrupt absolutely.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then why do you support by far the largest concentration of power, the state.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the Nazis thought of themselves as heroes   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, and they thought of themselves as members of a nation. You may not like <br>
Microsoft, but it never put millions of people into ovens, only nations do <br>
that.         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you fondly imagine that the USA's economic system rewards hard         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;work </i><br>
<p>
Hard word is irrelevant, it's not rewarded nor should it be. It's hard work <br>
to play the piano with your feet but I wouldn't give you a nickel for it. <br>
It's smart work that's rewarded.      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;ask yourself why, in the US, there is a near-perfect _inverse ratio</i><br>
<i>        &gt;between how arduous and unpleasant the work is, and how much you get         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;paid for doing it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't believe there is such a ratio. An off shore oil worker, a boxer, <br>
an ironworker, a bridge rigger, even a coal miner are all very dangerous jobs, <br>
many think they're unpleasant too, yet they're well paid. <br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;nearly every anarcho-capitalist I've ever met, almost none of whom         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;have any money </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you define an anarcho capitalist as somebody who engages in anarcho <br>
capitalistic actions then that particular creature is as mythical as a  <br>
unicorn, states do not allow people to be anarcho capitalists, yet.  <br>
Just  having such opinions does not seem to be detrimental to ones economic <br>
health,  I have a dollar or two.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Randians would advise talented people to make as _little_ as        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;possible, so as to withold resources from the looter State.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not a Randian. I finely got around to reading "Atlas Shrugged" about  <br>
2 months ago so. It was nice.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;there is a near-perfect inverse correlation between family income         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and and infant mortality rates.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And your point being...? Some group has to have the highest infant mortality <br>
rate, it's no surprise it's the poorest and most ignorant.  What other group <br>
do you suppose would have that distinction?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>         &gt;it is within our power to save the lives of children in Ethiopia      </i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
               <br>
<i>          &gt;we simply choose _not to_,    </i><br>
               <br>
Yes. Except for about a dollar a day (the Unibomber lived on less) you could  <br>
send your entire paycheck and savings to Ethiopia,  you could live on powered <br>
milk and soybeans and sleep on a bench at the airport or buss terminal. <br>
If you did that you would  save lives, no doubt about it. I'm not going to do <br>
that, or anything close to it, I very much doubt you are either. The human <br>
species is only capable of a finite amount of altruism, that's why communism <br>
didn't work and that's why the leaders of states are so dangerous. Instead of <br>
whining about something you're never going to change, try finding a system<br>
that can turn the selfishness that everybody has into a virtue.<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;preferring luxury ice-cream, and jewelled collars for our dogs. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
I make no apology for the fact that I like some dogs better than most people, <br>
hell I don't even know most people. I'm no different in that regard than any <br>
other pet owner in the world, otherwise we wouldn't spend billions of  <br>
dollars on them.<br>
               <br>
<i>        &gt;Think about that while spooning  down the Haagen-Dazs...      </i><br>
               <br>
That doesn't ruin my appetite, thinking about the fat does.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's blatant bullshit for anarcho-capitalism, where half a dozen         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;rich people of moderate cleverness  </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
If Bill Gates is only moderately clever and you're more than that then <br>
outsmart him in the marketplace and send 50 billion dollars to Ethiopia. <br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>         &gt;can control the entire society by owning key resources.</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Is it better for one leader to controls everything? Somebody please explain <br>
to me how nations are soon going to start making people more altruistic, even <br>
though they've never done that in the past.  After that explain how <br>
politicians who lead these nations will stay in power by making friends with <br>
the weak and the powerless.  <br>
<p>
Tony, near as I can tell  your main complaint against Anarcho Capitalism is <br>
that it's not as good as a nation state where the leaders always do exactly <br>
what Tony Hollick wants, perhaps so, but that's not really the choice we face <br>
now is it.     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There is a real problem with ingesting living organisms (or their         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;body parts) -- do they not also enjoy degrees of self-ownership?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I've given up eating living organisms, they objected so strongly that dinner <br>
became quite a struggle, besides I found they taste better when well done.<br>
