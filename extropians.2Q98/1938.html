<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; One minor quibble.  I think we have fossils of bones.  Not the same </i><br>
<i>&gt; thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; You quibble that we don't really have dinosaur bones?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Where is this leading?  Do you doubt that dinosaurs really could have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; existed?  Do you doubt that fossils are really the remains of dinosaur</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; bones?  What "hypothosis" would you propose instead?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; --</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It appears that a closet creationist has infiltrated the extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt;  ranks.  Next, we'll hear that the world started in 6000 b.c. and that </i><br>
<i>&gt;  God buried fake bones with divinely doctored carbon-14 signitures in </i><br>
<i>&gt;  order to test our faith!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In a previous mssg in response to this I said:<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;This is beginning to annoy me...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;RTFQ...read what I said..          &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
{more in sadness than in anger}<br>
<p>
I apologize for that last...<br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  It is a time honored tradition that if a question is asked...or a<br>
message is delivered which is uncomfortable...then ignore the question or the<br>
message and ridicule or attack the one who asked or delivered it. .<br>
Politicians have honed this to a fine art. Witness our current occupent of the<br>
oval office.<br>
<p>
Still...it's sad to see such tactics as ridicule, straw men...and name calling<br>
in response to perfectly sincere questions and speculation on this list.<br>
<p>
&lt;digging in heels...gonna be a looooooong fight&gt;<br>
<p>
First.<br>
<p>
Hypotheses: <br>
<p>
Given a collection of facts, data, etc.  A hypothesis is an attempt to order<br>
that information in such a way that is logical and explanatory.<br>
<p>
Theory:...an hypothesis that has survived the test of time.<br>
<p>
A theory can not be proved...it can only be disproved.  And if inconvient and<br>
contradictory facts, or data become apparent the theory (hypothesis) must be<br>
modified to accomodate the new info......or thrown out and replaced with<br>
something else.<br>
.....<br>
Quibble.  A fossile is NOT a bone.  It is a replica of a bone.  Similar to a<br>
plaster cast.  Some things can be determined from a replica...some things<br>
cannot.  For example...a plaster  replica of a steel beam would tell us very<br>
little about the tensile strength of that beam...merely it's shape.<br>
<p>
The question still remains.<br>
<p>
Knowing what we know of materials strength as applied to strength to weight<br>
ratio...and using the modern day elephant as an example...is it reasonable to<br>
assume that dinosaurs could reach such tremdous sizes and weights as is<br>
popularly beleived?<br>
<p>
I see nothing in that question which presupposes creationism....or any other<br>
ism.<br>
