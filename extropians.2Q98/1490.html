In a message dated 98-05-07 14:16:12 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; I kind of see it it as infinite space, and energy is part of it, like a<br>
<i> &gt; compressed,  expanding point into the infinite surroundings (any number is</i><br>
a<br>
<i> &gt; point compared to infinity).  Space is quantum, so I dont think it expands</i><br>
<i> &gt; biger and bigger like energy does.  Perhaps there are aspects of space</i><br>
related<br>
<i> &gt; to being nearby energy, but I think space is infinite.</i><br>
 <br>
 Huh? Wow, like cosmic man? :-)<br>
 <br>
 To be honest, the above doesn't make much sense, and the parts that<br>
 make sense doesn't seem to fit with known physics.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
"known physics"<br>
You dont understand it?  It doesnt take physicist to understand.  Im saying<br>
there is no limit to space.  The universe we see and the energy that is the<br>
universe is a point compared to infinite space.  With quantum I'm referring to<br>
the speed in which the limits are recognized, which is instantaneous, a<br>
paradox cause there are no limits, but energy and light travels at the speed<br>
of light, so its expanding.  Light is also connected quantumly so perhaps<br>
there is much more beyond what we see as the end of the universe, which we<br>
have not seen.  I think we used the hubble to look the farthest it can into a<br>
very dark space and the picture came with tons more galaxies.  <br>
<p>
Its just a thought, I wish people would play with ideas on here rather than<br>
beat them down. <br>
