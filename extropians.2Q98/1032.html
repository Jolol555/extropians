  IAN: And the identity-union between Navy <br>
  sonar and whale sonar may be causeing many <br>
  whales to be driven off course, "crashing,"<br>
  or beeching, onto the land. The low down: <br>

Whales Stranded During Military Test<br>
<p>
A puzzling episode of whale strandings along the western <br>
coast of Greece might have resulted from military tests of <br>
sonar going on at the time, speculates a Greek researcher.<br>
<p>
On May 12 and 13, 1996, 12 Cuvier's beaked whales ran <br>
aground along the Kyparissiakos Gulf, where they eventually <br>
died. Two weeks later, another dead whale was discovered <br>
on the same stretch of coast.<br>

<i>&gt;Personally I find the idea of animals who can 'see' an entire ocean far</i><br>

<p>
<p>
   IAN: It's got to be sentimental and romantic.<br>
   Really the whale songs are saying: "This Helps <br>
   me to find the place I initiate the wholesale <br>
   slaughter of a lot of entities smaller than me."<br>
