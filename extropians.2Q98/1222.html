From: GBurch1 &lt;GBurch1@aol.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;Likewise, the counter at McDonalds</i><br>
might be more efficient if<br>
<i>&gt;I entered my order directly into a</i><br>
keypad and had my food handed to me by a<br>
<i>&gt;robot, but I don't doubt that the live</i><br>
human face across the counter is seen<br>
<i>&gt;as a value by the operator of the</i><br>
store.<br>
<p>
Very true, no doubt. Additionally, a<br>
robot that could perform such tasks as<br>
handled by counter help would presently<br>
cost more than the rest of the McDonalds<br>
real estate and equipment.<br>
<p>
However, if and when the time comes that<br>
a robot counter person costs not much<br>
more than a flesh and blood version, we<br>
may be as surprised by the popularity of<br>
such an arrangement as the business<br>
world was surprised by the number of<br>
people who wanted personal computers<br>
fifteen years ago. Personally, I would<br>
trust a robot fast-food handler over a<br>
human one, and would enjoy the novelty<br>
even more than I enjoy McDonald's<br>
carcinogenic food fare.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thus, simply because it will be a</i><br>
luxury of sorts, having humans do jobs<br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;robots COULD do will likely become a</i><br>
significant factor in employing many<br>
<i>&gt;people who otherwise might become</i><br>
"disemployed".  Such jobs won't be the<br>
most<br>
<i>&gt;desirable ones and, with a few</i><br>
exceptions I can imagine, probably won't<br>
pay<br>
<i>&gt;very well.  (The exceptions are</i><br>
interesting, though -- I recall how<br>
amazed I<br>
<i>&gt;was to learn how much money waiters</i><br>
make in the most prestigious<br>
restaurants;<br>
<i>&gt;more than $100,000 per year.  Such jobs</i><br>
are admittedly rare.)<br>
<p>
Computer programmers make about half<br>
that much. So much for the idea of<br>
"creating a society that does not need<br>
its less qualified members" as someone<br>
mentioned earlier.<br>
<p>
Much depends on how you define<br>
"qualified." A simi-literate air-head<br>
can still win a beauty contest and get a<br>
role on Baywatch. Don't expect that to<br>
change a great deal in the post-human<br>
era. Except that simi-literate air-heads<br>
may get replaced by latex, silicon, and<br>
steel gynoids of the robotic kind.<br>
Remember Heidi the hooker madame? She<br>
made millions providing the flesh factor<br>
to men with a weakness for that<br>
particular product.<br>
<p>
So, in answer to Paul's question:<br>
<p>
"1) Is there a single field which is<br>
intrinsically safe from automation<br>
in the course of the next 20-30 years?<br>
If you can think of more fields,<br>
please elaborate."<br>
<p>
Answer: yes -- no need to elaborate.<br>
<p>
"2) Are these remaining fields if any,<br>
sufficient to employ the majority<br>
of humanity?  If not, what will the rest<br>
of humanity do in order to<br>
survive?"<br>
<p>
Answer: Of course not. Get some career<br>
training. Don't wait. Do it now.<br>
"Publish or perish."<br>
<p>
"3)  For those who are unemployed and do<br>
not have sufficient investment<br>
income, is death the inevitable result?<br>
If not, how will they survive?"<br>
<p>
Answer: Death has been the inevitable<br>
result of being alive since life began.<br>
But perhaps life has no beginning and no<br>
end. In which case, no one has anything<br>
of real substance to worry about. Those<br>
who choose to remain ignorant of the<br>
value of extropian perspectives, bring a<br>
certain amount of inconvenience into<br>
their lives. Anti-extropians may find it<br>
difficult to provide evidence that they<br>
deserve to survive. Socialism sucks. You<br>
don't produce | you don't eat. We can't<br>
reach the stars by planning vacations<br>
for socialistic slackers.<br>
<p>
"4) Will most people alive today be able<br>
to save enough before their jobs<br>
become automated?"<br>
<p>
Answer: *Most* people alive today don't<br>
have the smarts to pull their craniums<br>
out of their anal crevices. Of course<br>
this question implies that another<br>
socialistic big government project is<br>
needed to provide for the incompetent<br>
and inconsiderate who fail to keep up<br>
with what humanity urgently needs,<br>
namely a system based on ability,<br>
competence, and merit. Extropianism, in<br>
my view, diametrically opposes<br>
socialistic schemes. Extropy has no use<br>
for welfare queens and other dead wood.<br>
"Keep your eyes on the prize," and let<br>
the chips fall where they may. (Long<br>
live euthanasia. Support Dr. Kavorkian<br>
and access to assisted suicide.)<br>
<p>
"5) If how much money one has saved is<br>
the the key to surviving<br>
automation, does this not portend very<br>
badly for young people who have<br>
had less time to save for their forced<br>
retirement?  If this is true,<br>
does this mean that the future is going<br>
to be populated almost entirely<br>
of rich and old people and their<br>
children?"<br>
<p>
"Surviving automation"? How about<br>
enjoying the benefits of automation?<br>
Many things portend badly for young<br>
people. Especially the prospect of<br>
socialistic bullies who want to force<br>
young people to work and pay 70% income<br>
tax in twenty years in order to support<br>
the bloated bureaucracy of entitlements.<br>
No one who values extropian principles<br>
advocates forcing anyone into<br>
retirement. Rather, we recommend that<br>
people have the freedom to provide for<br>
their own needs in whatever ways they<br>
can invent. Today's youth does not owe<br>
government a living any more than<br>
corporations owe today's youth a living.<br>
<p>
A future "populated almost entirely by<br>
rich and old people and their children"<br>
sounds rather utopian to me. I wouldn't<br>
mind being rich. I suppose I will get<br>
old. I have no immediate plans to have<br>
children, but I enjoy their company for<br>
the most part. Gee whiz, Paul, it sure<br>
makes me happy to think that you won't<br>
do too much to stand in the way of such<br>
an idyllic future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another factor I have seen mentioned</i><br>
here is the trend toward making<br>
<i>&gt;commodities that were once dear</i><br>
essentially free "give-aways"; examples<br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;matches and water were discussed.  I</i><br>
can see food eventually falling into<br>
this<br>
<i>&gt;category, as well as even --possibly --</i><br>
shelter.  Perhaps resorts would offer<br>
<i>&gt;princely accommodations to their</i><br>
workers to encourage "qualified" people<br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;work in their service jobs. Such</i><br>
qualifications might consist of<br>
personality<br>
<i>&gt;and physical characteristics, rather</i><br>
than intelligence or "productive"<br>
<i>&gt;capacity per se.  Thus good looks or a</i><br>
pleasant personality might be much more<br>
<i>&gt;worthwhile assets than they are today.</i><br>
Perhaps only the ugly, rude AND stupid<br>
<i>&gt;will need some kind of dole in a truly</i><br>
post-industrial world.<br>
<p>
Or perhaps those in the latter category<br>
will simply continue to join N.O.W. to<br>
lobby for even more special privileges<br>
at the expense of competent workers. As<br>
for making commodities free, perhaps<br>
some enterprising city dweller might opt<br>
to provide free fresh air, in exchange<br>
for (what?). Actually, water used to be<br>
completely free for everyone who knew<br>
how to locate a spring, stream, river or<br>
lake. I remember reading that Benjamin<br>
Franklin had preferred to save money by<br>
dining on a half penny loaf of bread and<br>
some stream water for lunch in Boston<br>
(before the water became too polluted to<br>
drink).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Examples such as this one tend to make</i><br>
me less than catastrophically worried<br>
<i>&gt;about total "disemployment" for the</i><br>
great mass of humanity.  Any techno-<br>
<i>&gt;economic system that would make even</i><br>
"trivial" service jobs completely<br>
<i>&gt;irrelevant seems likely to be so</i><br>
productive that the whole problem<br>
becomes<br>
<i>&gt;moot.</i><br>
<p>
Right on. We have more worrisome things<br>
to consider than disemployment. The<br>
North Koreans are rumored to have more<br>
weapons of mass destruction than they<br>
have food. But disemployment has the<br>
potential of converting formerly<br>
productive workers into glass-bead-game<br>
players with no appreciation for the<br>
goals and objectives of such<br>
vocationally aroused people as (for<br>
instance) extropians. So the problem<br>
relates less to what to do with<br>
disemployed, less qualified members of<br>
society, and more to keeping these folks<br>
from organizing against the aims of<br>
extropy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the transitional period, it seems</i><br>
likely that the majority of humanity<br>
will<br>
<i>&gt;continue to do what they do now --</i><br>
subsistence agriculture.  The largest<br>
part<br>
<i>&gt;of humanity really isn't even in the</i><br>
20th century yet, technologically.  At<br>
<i>&gt;the point that the first few humans/AIs</i><br>
experience real "technotranscendance",<br>
<i>&gt;the largest part of humanity will be</i><br>
"irrelevant" to that process.  But this<br>
<i>&gt;says nothing of what those first</i><br>
post-humans will do FOR those left<br>
behind.  I<br>
<i>&gt;find much of the discussion about fears</i><br>
of what posthumans may do TO the<br>
<i>&gt;"left-behinds" implausible; it seems</i><br>
much more likely that the super-<br>
<i>&gt;productive powers of posthumans will be</i><br>
employed in what amounts to<br>
<i>&gt;philanthropic "uplift": The</i><br>
"extrosattva" of discussions we had here<br>
a few<br>
<i>&gt;months ago.</i><br>
<p>
As a potential post-human, I might dare<br>
to ask what those left behind had done<br>
for the cause of technotranscendence. We<br>
(i.e., I) often hear complaints that<br>
science and R&amp;D don't do much for the<br>
poor and less qualified members of<br>
society. Well, let's turn it around for<br>
once. What have the poor and less<br>
qualified done for the advancement of<br>
science and technology lately? As one of<br>
the poorest people in the US, with an<br>
income embarrassingly below the official<br>
poverty level, I feel fully qualified to<br>
ask this question. I appreciate what<br>
science has done for humanity, and I<br>
take the opportunity to express my<br>
gratitude whenever I can.<br>
<p>
Humanity needs extropy more than extropy<br>
needs humanity.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
