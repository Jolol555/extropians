Your arguments are very compelling! :-)<br>

In three years, you are the first free-marketeer to address my concerns in a<br>
detailed, precise and substantiated manner.  Thanks for the input.  I'm going to<br>
have to digest your last few posts over the next few days before I can have an<br>
opinion on them.<br>
