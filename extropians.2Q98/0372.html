<i> &gt; The Questions:</i><br>
<i> &gt; 1.	Do you have a high-tech body?  In other words, does your body </i><br>
<i> &gt; comprise any implants--transplants--smart limbs--electronic monitors, </i><br>
<i> &gt; etc.?</i><br>
<p>
It should be noted that currently you have to be pretty sick to have<br>
these in the first place. Which makes your life span probably shorter<br>
than average, unless you have signed up with a cryonics outfit, and<br>
that cryonics works. So you probably won't remain a trans for very long.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 2.	Does your brain contain a pacemaker--electrodes--other </i><br>
<i> &gt; peripherals?</i><br>
<p>
Ditto. I don't know of any legal recreational implants. Interfacing to <br>
the brain is notoriously difficult, the nature of the thing<br>
considered. Both the possible pathogen path, irritation due to<br>
subcranial cabling and impossibility to interface a rigid electrode<br>
array of any size beyond the trivial and expected long-term degeneration<br>
processes at the electrodes do not seem to make this a very enjoyable<br>
experience, currently. And epilepsy is also not my idea of a trans.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 3.  	Have you undergone major body reconstruction?  </i><br>
<p>
Major surgery is currently done either because of a) cosmetic b) medical<br>
reasons. In any case are modern methods of body modifications terribly <br>
crude, and should be limited to dire necessities. If having a lump of<br>
silicon within your body makes you a trans, be my guest. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 4.	Are your body processes such as moods--cycles--body temperature, </i><br>
<i> &gt; etc.--continuously telemonitored and regulated?</i><br>
<p>
Unless you do it for fun (I toyed with some of this) this means you're <br>
a pretty sick trans. Body temperature monitoring could be useful for<br>
contraception, though.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 5.	Are you connected to people and services via onbody (portable) </i><br>
<i> &gt; telecom?</i><br>
<p>
Trivial property. Pagers and cellulars are pretty ubiquitous. Times,<br>
they are a-changing.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 6.	Are you androgynous?</i><br>
<p>
Is this of any relevance? Are you bald? Do you have brown eyes?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 7.	Do you contribute to reproduction only through new collaborative </i><br>
<i> &gt; asexual methods?  For example:  (a) Have you ever donated your sex </i><br>
<i> &gt; cells for screening and possible fertilization?  (b) Have you ever </i><br>
<i> &gt; acted as 'surrogate mother'?</i><br>
<p>
This is pretty neutral. Still fail to see the relevance. If the<br>
creation process leaves no detectable artefacts, why putting into the <br>
definition?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 8.	Are you a product of artificial insemination or inovulation--in </i><br>
<i> &gt; vitro fertilization--telegenesis--frozen embryo implant?</i><br>
<p>
No big deal.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 9.	Are you postterritorial:  free of kinship </i><br>
<i> &gt; ties--ethnicity--nationality?</i><br>
<p>
Most modern techies are that.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 10.	Have you ever been outside this planet on space missions?</i><br>
<p>
You have to be pretty special for this, which could mean a lot for<br>
your future. Check.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 11.	Have you ever died and been rescusitated?</i><br>
<p>
Sicko, sicko.<br>
<p>
<p>
To sum it up, to me this seems like a list of remarkably irrelevant<br>
traits. A transhuman is imo a being which makes it at least a major<br>
fraction of the way through the Singularity/will live practically<br>
forever and changes dramatically in the process. A tranhumanist is<br>
someone who believes that would be a good thing, and tries to shape<br>
his life to work towards that. Tom Morrow's 'Trancendence through<br>
technology' is remarcably succinct and accurate, imo.<br>
