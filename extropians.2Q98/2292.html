One way that I have found it useful to think about my role as artist<br>
(electronic musician) is that I am entrusted with helping others to find<br>
tools that elevate the human spirit. Artwerks are some of those tools.<br>
Science and scientific discovery are others. Science and Art are both<br>
discliplines which give humanity tools that they can use to elevate<br>
their individual human spirit. They are clearly not the only ones. But<br>
judging by how people prize them, they are important ones.<br>
