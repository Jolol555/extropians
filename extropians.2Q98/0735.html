<i>&gt; Let's try a little experiment.  I'm about to ask you a question about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence of some thing, X.  At the moment, you have no belief about X's</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence, since I have not named it.  And yet it would seem *very* odd to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that your "simpl[e] absence of belief" qualifies you as an "atheist" with</i><br>
<i>&gt; regard to X.  (Oh, here's that question I promised:  Is there such a thing as</i><br>
<i>&gt; "aXist"?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hence my conclusion that atheists do more than simply not believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt; gods--they affirmatively disbelieve in them...</i><br>
<p>
This is all just a matter of definition rather than substance, but<br>
when it comes to what one describes oneself as to others, it is<br>
often important to use words with the right connotation.<br>
<p>
I think the impression left in the mind of most English-speakers<br>
when they hear someone describe eirself as an "agnostic" is that<br>
this person merely is unconcerned with religion; ey does not go to<br>
church, baptize children, etc.  But the label "agnostic" does not<br>
imply any disrespect for others' religious beliefs--if I hear<br>
someone call emself "agnostic", I would expect em to have no<br>
qualms about having close friends and associates who are dedicated<br>
theists, maybe even marry one, or support eir child's choice to<br>
believe, or even have some measure of respect for clergy.  <br>
<p>
When someone calls emself "atheist", I expect that such person<br>
might actually distrust openly theist folks, to entirely discount<br>
the opinions of clergy and even ridicule them, to actively oppose<br>
religious-based laws and practices, to oppose prayer and teaching<br>
creationist nonsense in schools, etc.<br>
<p>
It is for this reason that I call myself "atheist" even though<br>
Tom's more logical definition might not apply.  I want there to<br>
be no doubt in anyone's mind that even though I may rationally<br>
refuse to assert that there is positively no God, I nonetheless<br>
want to make it clear that I think those who assert that there<br>
is a God have lost my respect, and decisions of any kind made<br>
from theist doctrine are bad decisions, not merely different.<br>
