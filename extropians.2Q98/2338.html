Please excuse the subject line exaggeration :-), because I have great<br>
news.<br>
<p>
The Cryopreservation of Hippocampal Slices project, to be jointly<br>
conducted by the Institute for Neural Cryobiology (INC), was today<br>
approved in all aspects by the host university medical research<br>
institute. This means that lab space, animal care facilities, etc. at<br>
that institution and their half of the approximately $150K budget which<br>
will pay for salaries and supplies, have been made available to the<br>
project which now has the official sponsorship and "sanction" of the<br>
research institute. Please note, however, that this does still not mean<br>
that we can publicly use their name even as related to INC. Among the<br>
few minor changes that they made to the joint agreement was a more all<br>
encompassing statement that their name could not be used at all without<br>
their written permission in each case.<br>
<p>
As I have stated before, the success of this project may produce a<br>
combination of cryoprotectants and a method of introducing them which<br>
when applied to whole brains enables their functionally reversible<br>
cryopreservation. With hard work, and perhaps a bit of luck, my subject<br>
line may turn out to be little exaggeration after all.  <br>
<p>
This final approval of the project is what I have been waiting for<br>
before asking for any more contributions in order that INC can fulfill<br>
its obligations under the joint agreement to purchase and provide the<br>
bulk of the advanced equipment (and get to retain ownership and future<br>
use of that equipment, of course). At this time, we need about $45,000<br>
in additional contributions to finance those purchases.<br>
<p>
Though many people have done so already (see list below), now is the<br>
time for all those people who supported the my efforts to jump-start<br>
reverisble cryopreservation research by making pledges, to extend that<br>
support as contributors to this enormously important, first real<br>
project to arise from those efforts. I know that many of you had hoped<br>
to be able to invest in the research work which would be done and I am<br>
truly displeased that this has not so far been able to be accomplished<br>
in a manner acceptable to most of you. However, I feel certain that<br>
any money which you can contribute to this project will be repaid to<br>
you manyfold as value of one kind or another. If we can make this<br>
initial project into a major success, there may still be a chance for<br>
significant portions of the original project ideas to be actualized.<br>
<p>
Please send all contributions to:<br>
<p>
The Institute for Neural Cryobiology<br>
8439 White Oak Ave., Suite 110<br>
Rancho Cucamonga, 91730-3860<br>
<p>
I remind you again that all contributors will receive an official<br>
donation receipt from INC which may be used to reduce their US federal<br>
and California state taxable income on their next return.<br>
<p>
I look forward to hearing from you and receiving your contributions.<br>
