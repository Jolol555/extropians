First, if choosing 2 would hurt humanity, then utilitarianism demands that<br>
we choose 1, not 2.  You're arguing against EGOISM, the philosophy that<br>
each agent should make choices in such a way as to maximize his-her OWN<br>
utility, as opposed to utilitarianism which argues for greatest utility<br>
for greatest number.  Utilitarianism is, for this reason, often criticized<br>
that it ISN'T "me first" enough: that it seems to require us to make some<br>
rather extreme sacrifices for the well-being of others.  I disagree with<br>
these thinkers, but one thing I CAN say is that there's no possible way to<br>
construe this philosophy as a "me first" principle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think that we can say that a "utility first"</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle is a definitionally open door to fraud</i><br>
<i>&gt; (as just one example in a field of possible worst </i><br>
<i>&gt; case examples), and fraud is an icon of that which</i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel an Extropian community should be against. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; "truth first" ethic instills a standard of ethics:</i><br>
<i>&gt; a principle which the individual must subordinate</i><br>
<i>&gt; him/herself for "the greater good," which, lets </i><br>
<i>&gt; face it, is a defining principle of any com-</i><br>
<i>&gt; minity, that I will agree to abide by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; set of rules that includes your rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that Daniel is correct to observe the </i><br>
<i>&gt; utilitarian aspect of a truth-first principle,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but this aspect is just as well as saying,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Utility dictates that some other standard</i><br>
<i>&gt; than utility be the prime directive."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Not at all, it is simply a statement that utlitarianism and truth-first<br>
are extensionally equivalent.  Since utilitarianism is a philosophy of<br>
action and total consequence, it states that acting according to<br>
truth-first is just as good as doing the utilitarian thing, BECAUSE THEY<br>
AGREE ON WHAT THE RIGHT THING IS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Utility without ethics leads to Nazism.</i><br>
<p>
This is silly.  This would only sort of be an acceptable conclusion if you<br>
counted Jews as non-people (an obvious Big Lie) or if WWII didn't happen.<br>
<p>
Since Jews ARE people and WWII DID happen, utilitarianism states that<br>
Naziism is WRONG.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ethics</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a broad and subjective field of ideas, but I </i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that we can extract one solid, reliable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and objective principle from it: truth, defined</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a one-one mapping between "ideas and claims"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "physical reality." </i><br>
<p>
Obviously, since your conclusions on what utilitarianism demands are<br>
completely wrong, your rejection of its conclusions do not refute<br>
utilitarianism.<br>
<p>
Goddard, utilitarianism is a consequentialist philosophy, which means that<br>
it evaluates choices and actions based on their consequences, just as you<br>
do and have.  It states that an action is right if and only if it results<br>
in the best possible consequences.  It evaluates consequences based on the<br>
utility of all people, where utility is defind as their happiness,<br>
satisfaction, etc.  One consequence is better than another if it results<br>
in greater happiness for a greater number.  Thus, the right action results<br>
in the greatest utility for the greatest number.<br>
<p>
THIS is the philosophy you have so maligned, and so completely<br>
misunderstood.  Obviously, Naziism is completely incompatible with<br>
utilitarianism:  it involves killing people, which is bad, AND it results<br>
in great unhappiness for the German people when WWII rolls around, which<br>
is also bad.  Utilitarianism DOES have problems, but supporting Naziism is<br>
not one of them.<br>
