From: Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One problem with simplistic space</i><br>
expansion models is that space may be<br>
<i>&gt;infinite.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it "may be." The task for<br>
extropians comes down to this: grow up<br>
and find out. Space may also exist as a<br>
finite, yet unbounded quality, as<br>
Einstein suggested. Then again, space<br>
may succumb to the manipulative designs<br>
of super-intelligent transhumans. We<br>
might have the capability to know these<br>
things if we expand our cognitive<br>
skills.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the simplest models from general</i><br>
relativity, if the density<br>
<i>&gt;of the universe is so small that it</i><br>
will expand forever and not contract,<br>
<i>&gt;that also implies that the universe,</i><br>
although curved, does not "close"<br>
<i>&gt;and so goes on forever.</i><br>
<p>
If it doesn't go on forever, then<br>
something else does. Whatever goes on<br>
forever, I choose to call "the<br>
universe." Accept no substitutes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can still have an expanding</i><br>
universe even if it is spatially<br>
infinite.<br>
<p>
"Expanding infinity"... that deserves a<br>
special prize awarded by the drop-outs<br>
of high school math. Just kidding. No<br>
alacrity intended.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It just means that distant objects move</i><br>
apart, slowly at first, and then<br>
<i>&gt;faster and faster.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, it means that does it? Gosh, let's<br>
let Hubble know about this post haste.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Suppose space were not expanding.  It</i><br>
is three dimensional, obviously<br>
<i>&gt;(ignoring the "time dimension").  Would</i><br>
you demand that there exist a<br>
<i>&gt;four dimensional space in which the</i><br>
three dimensional one was embedded,<br>
<i>&gt;in order to give it reality?  And would</i><br>
that four dimensional space have<br>
<i>&gt;to be part of a larger five dimensional</i><br>
space, which is itself part of<br>
<i>&gt;a six dimensional one, and so on?</i><br>
<p>
Suppose your dreams expand in a<br>
direction opposite to that of reality.<br>
Yes! We've done it! Now, how many<br>
dimensions will you assign to your<br>
snoring?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;All this is conceivable, but is it</i><br>
really necessary?<br>
<p>
In your dreams ("suppose space were not<br>
expanding"), it remains not only<br>
necessary, it remains definitive.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I don't think we need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to assume there are higher dimensional</i><br>
spaces in order to give ours<br>
<i>&gt;reality.</i><br>
<p>
Oh? Who died and put you in charge of<br>
assigning realities? The dimensions of<br>
space have their own way of defining<br>
their numbers. They don't require<br>
intervention on the part of carbon-based<br>
gods.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even though our space is said to be</i><br>
"curved", and expanding, those<br>
<i>&gt;properties do not require higher</i><br>
dimensional spaces, either.  Curvature<br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;like a gradual internal warping of</i><br>
space, so that large enough triangles<br>
<i>&gt;don't have angles that add to exactly</i><br>
180 degrees.  It can be fully<br>
<i>&gt;described without reference to any</i><br>
larger embedding space.<br>
<p>
I take back everything I've said. This<br>
clears it all up, and I'll never try to<br>
divulge this information to anyone else,<br>
because it suddenly occurs to me that<br>
all my attempts to convey any idea about<br>
how reality actually works probably<br>
appear to those who really do understand<br>
these matters as silly ego trips into<br>
the arena of spewing personal<br>
viewpoints. Sorry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Likewise the expansion of space can be</i><br>
expressed soley in terms of the<br>
<i>&gt;relations between objects within our</i><br>
universe.  There is no need to<br>
<i>&gt;postulate a higher dimensional universe</i><br>
which ours is part of.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
"soley"? Do you mean /solely/?<br>
<p>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
