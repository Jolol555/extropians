<i>&gt; From:          Paul Hughes &lt;planetp@aci.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At last count, 94% of the wealth in the US is in the hands</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the top 20%.  The greatest discrepancy in US history.  So my challenge to</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-market advocates is to demonstrate how free-markets can bring increased</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosperity to *more* people rather than concentrating that new wealth into the hands</i><br>
<i>&gt; of fewer and fewer people.</i><br>
<p>
Reality check.<br>
<p>
Based on operating expenses, federal, state, and local governments <br>
own approximately 40% of the wealth in the US.  These governments, <br>
allegedly, represent ALL of us, rich and poor alike.  This means <br>
that, in theory, the least wealthy 80% own 32% of the wealth in the <br>
US by THIS MEANS ALONE.  And if reality does not mesh with this <br>
theory, the solution obviously is not in the hands of the government.<br>
<p>
Outside of that, the claim that 94% of *other* wealth is owned by the <br>
richest 20% even begins to be plausible only if one excludes pension <br>
funds and mutual funds from consideration.  Since pension funds and <br>
mutual funds collectively own  over half the stock and bond markets, <br>
this is obviously a major exclusion and needs to be justified.<br>
