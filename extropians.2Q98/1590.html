I have a few final comments &amp; references (then those<br>
who want to turn the list into a chatroom can get<br>
back to more exciting contemporary topics of<br>
technology &amp; politics ;) However, as an addendum for<br>
the "Near-Term Scenarios" thread, those looking for<br>
Nomological resolutions of the Hard Problems will be<br>
disappointed...<br>
<p>
Daniel noted:<br>
&lt; The problem here is that concepts need not always<br>
be formed the same way.  [CUT] This does not expose<br>
any fatal flaws for Objectivist epistemology -- any<br>
more than it would for any other flavor of<br>
epistemology. &gt;<br>
<p>
A very interesting 1993 paper (but new to me) that I<br>
was reading over the weekend is Mark Bickhard's<br>
"Representational Content in Humans and Machines"<br>
(<a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/repcon.html">http://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/repcon.html</a> - Bickhard<br>
is a psychologist, philosopher and head of the<br>
Computer Science department at Lehigh University in<br>
Pennsylvania ).<br>
<p>
What I think many of the 'constructivist' sources I<br>
mentioned last week mean when they derogatorily speak<br>
of Objectivism is what Bickhard calls ENCODINGISM. <br>
Referring to various cognitive scientists that he has<br>
reviewed, Bickhard says: "they all share ... an<br>
underlying logical incoherence in their<br>
presuppositions. Specifically, they all propose or<br>
presuppose that representation is fundamentally<br>
constituted as some form of encodings". Basically, he<br>
says, the problem with this is that "in order for an<br>
encoding to be defined, some already existing<br>
representation (or string of representations) must<br>
already carry the desired representational content...<br>
there must be a lowest level ... not defined in terms<br>
of any other representations".<br>
<p>
Anyway, Bickhard proposes "INTERACTIVISM: A model of<br>
Emergent representation ... developed within control<br>
theory ... [as] a framework for a particular kind of<br>
functional analysis [SKIPping  many pages] ... [of]<br>
processes that require continued transactions with<br>
their environments". The first important property is<br>
"recursive self-maintenance".  Which is, I think,<br>
what you were getting at when you said<br>
&lt; There does seem to be a difference, though, between<br>
a control system in general and a living system. &gt;<br>
<p>
But, of course, this is all much too involved to<br>
discuss in this forum. Anyway, I just wanted to point<br>
out what some in the research community seem to mean<br>
when they dismiss Objectivism.<br>
<p>
However, this doesn't mean that there is no such<br>
thing as an Objective Reality.  Another article<br>
that's useful on this (which I also haven't quite<br>
finished digesting) is Barry Smith's 1995 "Formal<br>
Ontology, Common Sense and Cognitive Science"<br>
(<a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/philosophy/ontology/focscs.htm">http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/philosophy/ontology/focscs.htm</a>)<br>
which does much to debunk notions of cultural<br>
relativism in a rigorous way.<br>
<p>
Smith mentions your point about Eskimos having many<br>
words for snow, and notes: "Differences of this sort<br>
may imply that the common-sense world that is<br>
discriminated by natural cognition may differ from<br>
culture to culture ... HOWEVER, they constitute no<br>
challenge to our two theses of uniqueness and<br>
autonomy of the common-sense world, since they<br>
reflect no ontological incompatibility on the side of<br>
objects, but rather differences of granularity or of<br>
calibration in our articulation of one and the same<br>
world".<br>
<p>
Smith also deals with arguments about "naïve physics"<br>
and "folk psychology", and fretting about<br>
"emergence", that some authors on the Extropian<br>
reading list (eg: Minsky, Churchland) make much of. <br>
But Smith warns about over-reliance on what Bickhard<br>
called "observer semantics": "The thesis that the<br>
common-sense world is capable of being investigated<br>
in large part by standard physical means may,<br>
however, have limited implications. Thus suppose,<br>
with [D.R. Hilbert, 1987], that we identify colour<br>
with the physical property of surface reflectance.<br>
The latter is an objective property and is physically<br>
well understood, yet, as Hilbert points out, 'it is<br>
not reducible to more fundamental physical<br>
properties. Fundamentally different physical<br>
mechanisms can result in objects that possess very<br>
similar dispositions to reflect light. The<br>
reflectance of an object is a *multiply grounded<br>
dispositional property*'" (my emphasis).<br>
<p>
Finally (hidden here at the bottom, after everyone<br>
else has already blown off this post ;-), I was<br>
fascinated by your comments on esthetics.  Another<br>
lengthy article that might intrigue you is Brian<br>
Massumi's "Involuntary Afterword"<br>
(<a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/HRC/first_and_last/works/crclintro.htm">http://www.anu.edu.au/HRC/first_and_last/works/crclintro.htm</a>),<br>
his piece for a special issue of The Canadian Review<br>
of Comparative Literature, "Deleuze, Guattari and the<br>
Philosophy of Expression" (same URL but with<br>
crcltoc.htm). <br>
<p>
Actually, this brings me back to one of the footnotes<br>
in my original response last week, where I pondered<br>
the possibly extropian nature of Guattari's notion of<br>
"surplus-value semantics".  What I was trying to get<br>
at there is what section 2 of this CRCL issue calls<br>
"The Superior Empiricism of the Human".  Massumi, in<br>
his purely poetic way, puts it like this: <br>
<p>
"Even Kant notes the priority of process over form in<br>
aesthetic experience. Beauty, he says, is 'drusy.' Or<br>
more precisely, our interest in beauty is awakened by<br>
drusiness. What in the OED is 'drusy'? A dusting of<br>
miniature crystals appearing on a surface: the<br>
sparkle of an appealing roughness that lures the eye<br>
to extend the hand. ...<br>
<p>
"The drusy, in awakening our interest in beauty,<br>
points us in the direction of a non-cognitive<br>
aesthetics: aesthetics as a kind of empiricism<br>
involving itself with real conditions of emergence,<br>
under-with cognitive conditions, or conditions of<br>
possibility (Deleuze 1994, 154, 231-232, 285;<br>
O'Connell). Drusiness points to the post-Kantian<br>
dimension in Kant, or what Deleuze will call a<br>
'superior empiricism' (1994, 56-57, 143-144).[5] What<br>
is 'superior' about it is that subject and object<br>
integrate into a greater autonomy of participation, a<br>
matter-manner meld adding a new line of<br>
multiple-singular encounter to the world: that of a<br>
technic, an artificed between of any number of<br>
possible subjects and objects, autonomous of any<br>
given particular subject or object. This empiricism<br>
is 'superior' because it is creative of reality. It<br>
adds to reality." <br>
