<i>&gt; I'd be interested to hear (off-list if you prefer) if anyone else on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; list are home educating their children or know of anyone who is.  Seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; me that this choice might be popular among this sort of crowd.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have 5 children and a nice sub-tropical lifestyle.  High-tech and</i><br>
<i>&gt; tele-commuting, we've dumped public education and believe that we can do it</i><br>
<i>&gt; better.  Others ?</i><br>
<p>
We homeschooled both of our kids.  The eldest took a GED pre-screening and <br>
will have to spend a couple months on her math before taking the test.<br>
<p>
The youngest, we used a correspondence course (from ICS) for high school.  A <br>
program equivalent to 4 years of high school, she finished over the course of <br>
about 1.4 standard academic years (studying only half days), completing it <br>
about 3 months after her 15th birthday.<br>
