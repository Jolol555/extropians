That's the problem.  <br>
<p>
A perfect social or political system, in all systems I have examined, <br>
requires perfect people in some quantity -- dictatorship being the <br>
best in this regard because it requires the fewest perfect people, <br>
and anarchy among the worst because it requires that the overwhelming <br>
majority -- possibly everyone -- be perfect.  In this part of the <br>
world, perfect people are a rather scarce item, and what I read in <br>
the newspapers doesn't tell me that this is a strictly local <br>
shortage.<br>
<p>
Imperfect anarchy is unstable, and seems likely to quickly collapse <br>
into tribal warlordism, and then later into dictatorship or <br>
hereditary monarchy.<br>
