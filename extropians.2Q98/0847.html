<i>&gt;&gt;This is obvious. Most Scientologists would probably also be annoyed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;when Scientology was called a cult by others.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  IAN: Ouch! What a low blow!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not at all. I just wanted to show that the members of a cult often do not<br>
like to be called members of a cult, and I needed to give an example we<br>
agree on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  IAN: Erik, what your saying is illogical by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  very facts that you concede. Your trying to imply</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that ExI is a member of a subset of cults that even</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you admit does not exist. IF (a very BIG if) ExI does</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fall into the set of cults (and by your standards, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;  would any organization with a set of principles), it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  then a member of a subset of cults that does NOT inter-</i><br>
<i>&gt;  sect with the  subset of cults of which cults such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Scientology are a member.  However,  as your reply to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Natasha proves, you are implying that ExI is a member</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the subset of "bad cults," even as in your latter</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reply to me above, you admit it's NOT such a member!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You completely and probably deliberately misinterpreted my reply to Natasha.<br>
Although I see fascist tendencies in some of the consequences of Extropian<br>
ideas, especially the free market meme (a wrong subset of the individual<br>
freedom meme, wrong because enterprises are no individuals), I do not think<br>
that the ExI directly supports or conveys such tendencies.<br>
<p>
I would not call the ExI a sect, but I would call Scientology a sect. I<br>
would, however, call both cults. Because "cult" is a very broad word, many<br>
groups fit under this description. Most, but not all of them are negative.<br>
The ExI is, in my opinion, negative because it promotes ideas that are,<br>
based on my knowledge, harmful to humanity. That's why I am an<br>
Anti-Extropian. The ExI is, however, not negative because it robs its<br>
members of their possessions, executes brainwashing or has a strong (if any)<br>
hierarchy. AFAIK, none of these attributes apply to ExI.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It seems to me, Erik, that your simply engaging in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  gratuitous cruelty against some  very  good people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You argue that ExI falls into the definitional set</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of "cult," then note that it's not your fault that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "cult" has negative connotations, as if your just</i><br>
<i>&gt;  an innocent bystander in this, and yet then you do</i><br>
<i>&gt;  all that you can to rub that negative connotation</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in a deeply as you can (as illogical as I've just</i><br>
<i>&gt;  shown it to be), obviously, simply  BECAUSE  you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  know it's hurting some very decent people. Why?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Some very decent people? Define decent. I indeed said that it is not my<br>
fault that "cult" has negative connotations. These connotations are, again,<br>
brainwashing, loss of possessions, strong hierarchy and so on. That doesn't<br>
make ExI positive, and I never said that I like the idea of Extropy. See my<br>
reply to John Clark's "Words Hurt" for a summary of what I dislike about<br>
ExI. Most of these attributes, however, do not make ExI a cult and one<br>
attribute which I both totally reject and which is "cultish" is Max More's<br>
policy not to allow criticism on this list. As I *am* still on this list,<br>
and criticism has taken place, I am not sure what to think about it now. I<br>
would need an "official" statement from Max on this.<br>
<p>
To summarize: Extropy is a cult, but that's not the main reason why it is<br>
negative.<br>
<p>
I have no interest to hurt anybody. I don't think that I have hurt anybody.<br>
