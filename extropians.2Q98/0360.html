<i>&gt; &gt;While I agree with the upper statements, your last is at the least foolish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and at the worst completely, criminally, ludicrous. To fail to respond with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;greater force to an individual who uses force to impose his will, gain his ro</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;her ends simply winds up in a vicious cycle of them demanding more and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from you until you are enslaved or dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Agreed. After rereading what I had written I realized I had made a mistake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Can I rephrase my statement to say: there are certain times when using</i><br>
<i>&gt;       force is necessary and appropriate, and other times when it is not. I generally</i><br>
<i>&gt;       accept the libertarian principal of using force only for ones self defense and not</i><br>
<i>&gt;       "pro-actively." The trick and question is knowing when it is approropriate and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  necessary, and who gets to decide.</i><br>
<p>
Any individual should and can decide for themselves. That is the central point of having all<br>
political power be derived from the individual. If the average human cannot handle such simple<br>
decisions, then individual liberty is a really really really stupid idea. I don't think it is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Up here in New Hampshire (yup, here I go again), as well as across the river</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Vermont, we have possibly the highest per capita level of gun ownership in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the industrialized world, and probably the one of the highest in the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; world, yet I challenge anyone on this list to name one European or other</i><br>
<i>&gt; industrialized nation of the same size or larger as our state, that has a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; restrictive gun policy yet has a lower crime rate. You can't.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       "An armed "society" is a polite "society" -- I forget who said this but I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt;        is appropriate here.  (quotes are mine).</i><br>
<p>
I recall Robert Heinlein saying it, but he may have been quoting someone else...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again, I generally agree with you. I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;        certainly not a proponent of "gun control" (so-called). My intention in my origional</i><br>
<i>&gt;        statement was only meant to imply 1)that *I* would prefer to avoid violence and 2)</i><br>
<i>&gt; that sometimes using "more sophisiticated means" is appropriate. "More sophisticated</i><br>
<i>&gt; means" might include assasinating a dictator like Hitler in an early time frame before</i><br>
<i>&gt; he had the opportunity to start a war, rather waiting until you have a full blown war.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "More sophisticated means" may also mean using non-violence. For example, I think         the</i><br>
<i>&gt; IRS is little more than mafia with good PR. But instead of starting a violent</i><br>
<i>&gt; revolution to overthrow the IRS, I simply arrange my affairs so I don't support them         in</i><br>
<i>&gt; any way.</i><br>
<p>
While being smart and planning ahead are always good policies, it is still likely that there will<br>
be some time in your life when you have to stand up to some sort of bully. Being prepared and<br>
knowing what needs to be done are 9/10ths of what it takes to do the right thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        I hope this clears up my point.</i><br>
<p>
Yes it does, thank you. I hope that those who might have taken solace in what might have been a<br>
different position will think differently.<br>
