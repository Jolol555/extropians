The report of angiostatin and endostatin points out that great science<br>
is still 90% perspiration  after the 10% inspiration passes.<br>
<p>
I also have some good news.  Not of the same significance but still<br>
useful.  The lowly buffaloberry of which we are growing about 100,000<br>
of as field shelterbelts may harbour a worthy addition to the<br>
cocktail of drugs available to aids carriers.  For those of us in south<br>
Saskatchewan Canada who live in yearly fear of running dryland farms in <br>
an area not usually suited to being very productive it really makes the<br>
day when something we can grow well  and think of as worthless is found<br>
to have enough potential  value to become a mainstay to pay the bills<br>
for the inputs we  need to use to grow the ordinary crops everybody<br>
takes for granted.<br>
<p>
What do you people think..Should I contract with aids carriers to<br>
sell them the leaves at so much a tree?  They would get a signed and<br>
numbered tree certificate with a picture of their tagged and numbered <br>
"rent-a-tree".  Each november they'd get the year's leaf production<br>
and any fruit born as well.  <br>
<p>
This would be much like what some horse owners do to keep afloat.<br>
They raise horses and stable them all winter to collect horse urine from<br>
which Ayerst Pharmaceuticals extracts the base materials for<br>
contaceptives and chemically related drugs.  <br>
<p>
Without the added value from the drugs many of the horse farmers<br>
wouldn't be producing the simple everyday farm products people <br>
take for granted.  <br>
<p>
Goes to prove, the most useful things can come from abscure beginnings?<br>

<p>
Two new hydrolyzable tannins, shephagenins A and B, were isolated along with<br>
hippophaenin A and strictinin from the leaf extract of Shepherdia argentea,<br>
which showed a remarkable inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency<br>
virus (HIV)-1 reverse transcriptase. Their structures, having a gluconic acid<br>
core, have been elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical methods.<br>
The inhibitory effect of the leaf extract on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was<br>
found to be due to tannins, and their activities were stronger than that of<br>
(-)-epigallocatechin gallate as a positive control.<br>

Buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea Nutt.)<br>
<p>
Buffaloberry is native of the southern parts of western Canada and is found growing naturally in<br>
river valleys and around sloughs. Although it prefers moist well drained sites, it will tolerate<br>
some spring flooding and is drought hardy. Buffaloberry is tolerant to saline and alkaline soils.<br>
Buffaloberry is a bushy,tall shrub that grows to height of 4 to 5 metres. This shrub species<br>
suckers and forms a dense irregular hedge. The lateral branches have sharp spines at the tip and<br>
are formed at right angles to the main branch. The leaves are silvery on both sides. The small<br>
yellow flowers, appearing in late June or early July, are borne in clusters along stems. The<br>
buffaloberry produces male and female flowers on seperate plants; only the female plants bear<br>
fruit. Fruit ripens in July and August and varies from scarlet to orange in colour.<br>
<p>
Uses for Wildlife<br>
The fruit is an important winter food for game birds and other species - such as waxwings - that<br>
remain for the winter. The buffaloberry's suckering habit creates excellent edge cover and also<br>
assures continuation of the species. The shrub is of minor importance as a browse species.<br>
