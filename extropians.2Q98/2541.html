<p>
Actually, there are good reasons to expect that you cannot do that, at<br>
least not from our kind of intelligence. See Antonio Damasio's work<br>
(e.g. _Descartes' Error_ and a lot of research papers) on how<br>
disruptions of the emotional subsystems of the brain impair rational<br>
thinking. He has some quite clear descriptions of patients that have<br>
perfect memory, logical reasoning and knowledge, and still make<br>
completely stupid decisions due to lack of feedback from emotional<br>
subsystems. They are necessary to keep us from needlessly exploring<br>
unfavorable or negative avenues of action, and to motivate us to seek<br>
those actions that benefit ourselves. The same would go for an AI: if<br>
it didn't care if the results would be positive or negative, it would<br>
just act randomly or not at all ("Do something! The reactor is<br>
exploding and will kill all of us!" "So what?"). Emotions seem to act<br>
as heuristics for alpha-beta pruning of our decision trees.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When people (like scientists) deal with a difficult problem,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they tend to focus fully on it, blocking out cluttering</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotions. That's what you want the AI to be: a focussed</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinker, not disturbed by the urge to mate or whatever.</i><br>
<p>
Without emotions, it would have no motivation to focus. And as a<br>
scientist, I can definitely tell you that working on difficult<br>
problems is highly emotional. I might not be thinking of mate finding,<br>
but I am certainly experiencing various shades of curiosity,<br>
frustration, surprise, boredom and ambition that definitely help my<br>
cognitive processes.<br>
