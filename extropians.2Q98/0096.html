<i>&gt;         &gt;Centralized systems are not inherently bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tell that to the impoverished people of the former USSR.</i><br>
<p>
The USSR malfunctioned for many reasons, but probably most of<br>
all its redicilous communist ideology. This doesn't mean that <br>
centralism automatically lead to poverty. Many European countries<br>
make this point just fine. Flawed? Certainly. Impoverished? Hardly.<br>
Centralism is what you make it, and it does not necessarily<br>
exclude the free market (after all, there's plenty of free market<br>
in centralised Europe and the US, for example), but it means<br>
that some crucial things just aren't left to chance (free market <br>
forces). In itself, I think that is a sound idea. Since no-one<br>
has ever set up a centralized system based on _transhumanistic_<br>
ideas we simply cannot say that it won't work yet, comparing<br>
centralized transhumanism to centralized communism is silly;<br>
the ideologies coundn't differ more.<br>
<p>
By the way, before I'll get tangled up in the devil's advocate stuff again,<br>
I'd like to state that I don't _oppose_ anarcho-capitalism in itself. It's<br>
a great idea, but I just don't think it will ever work properly in this world<br>
with these people. As I stated earlier, anarcho-capitalism requires<br>
active participation by rational, independent individuals. The very fact<br>
that history (including the present) is a long list of oppression and<br>
ignorance makes me seriously wonder whether humanity is ready<br>
for this experiment, whether it just won't lead to even worse situations<br>
than we know today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;A centralized system can be benevolent in its intentions, anarchy,       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;like nature itself, doesn't give a crap about fairness or individual     </i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;well-being.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm interested in results, I don't give a damn about intentions. I hope I  </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't come across sounding too cynical but any system that must rely on  </i><br>
<i>&gt; people loving each other is not going to work. </i><br>
<p>
I think my system with all its surveillance etc. is cynical enough to take on<br>
the real world. Anarcho-capitalism on the other hand is IMO based on the<br>
false premise that people will just turn en masse to libertarianism once<br>
they get the chance (or have been "educated"). Well, it ain't gonna happen.<br>
Just like you can tell people all about cryonics and how rational et al it is,<br>
explain every stupid detail x times and still get nowhere, you can hammer<br>
all the libertarian wisdom you want into the masses and they'll still follow<br>
the first guy with some smooth red/reli/whatever talk. The proof is on the<br>
table. Dispite (undoubtedly) heroic efforts, anything only vaguely resembling<br>
a libertarian party is pitifully small in any country of significance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The farmer grows my food, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; trucker moves my food and the grocer sells my food, none of these people love </i><br>
<i>&gt; me, yet the free market plunges them into a conspiracy to put food on my </i><br>
<i>&gt; table.    </i><br>
<p>
First of all, if you think my system is based on "love" please read again. It's<br>
based on a rather cynical idea about human nature really. Furthermore, all<br>
the people you mentioned (and then some) will be out of a job in a couple<br>
of decades bedause machines can do it a lot better &amp; cheaper, and unless<br>
you either want to shoot them or let them become a very desperate and dangerous<br>
layer of society, you will need some kind of welfare to support them. (the<br>
free food etc. handouts I mentioned in another thread come into play here).<br>
Release these people into anarcho-capitalism and they'll likely become<br>
the loyal supporters of the first would-be dictator that happens to come<br>
along with promises of a better life. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Anarchy is inherently unstable </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Internet is an anarchy, it seems to work.</i><br>
<p>
The internet owes its existence to the computernetworks of centralized states,<br>
mainly the US. It can also "work" because it's very limited, all bits 'n'bites and <br>
no physical contact. Also, it is still a playground of the more advanced<br>
layres of society; most people are *not* connected. But most of all, the net<br>
is something you can turn off and ignore with the touch of a button if you don't<br>
like it. The real world on the other hand is somewhat harder to switch off...<br>
           <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;In other words we want our judges to have a highly developed sense      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;of justice, well it's hard to disagree with that, but the question      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;is how do we  obtain it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;By selection on the desired criteria, continous training in the most     </i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;difficult cases, continous surveillance</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Continuos surveillance would be enough to stop most from going into that line     </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; of work, it would certainly stop me.</i><br>
<p>
Well, fortunately there is diversity and thus plenty of people who would do it.<br>
I can well imagine that many "secret" government jobs are a lot worse,<br>
add what to think about cops and soldiers etc, risking their butt for a fraction<br>
of the pay and privileges.<br>
           <br>
<i>&gt;            &gt;(to prevent corruption), excellent pay,        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; High pay won't stop corruption, regardless of how much money you have it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; never enough. </i><br>
<p>
A good thing we have electronic surveillance then, and people that are (finacially)<br>
motivated to detect flaws in the system...The pay is merely an extra.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Good surveillance brings out the saint in anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd rather be a sinner.</i><br>
<p>
So you want to be corrupt, steal, rape and murder? Just about anything else is<br>
legal you know. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;and all judicial candidates are subject to intensive psychological       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;profiling, not just one but continously.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Psychological profiling is crap. </i><br>
<p>
That depends...With the aid of brainscans and the like we'll be able to<br>
reduce the vagueness in psychology. The rest must depend on good old<br>
common sense (and yes, there *is* something like "common sense").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Who profiles the psychological profiler?</i><br>
<p>
Checks and balances, so several teams of profilers who's salary depends<br>
on the results of their work (actually, this is something that would apply to *all*<br>
government employees -- pretty radical, eh). do the testing. So a good profiler <br>
gets wealthy, while a bad one sees a reduction in payment followed by "the boot" if<br>
the bad results continue. Judges, cops, clerks etc. -- the same. Just like in a<br>
normal company. This would take on bureaucratic inefficiency at its root.<br>
           <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The free market is no magic bullet, not by far. Many a good product      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;has failed for trivial and/or incomprehensible reasons. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The reasons they failed are often comprehensible and never trivial. </i><br>
<p>
They can be as trivial as placing the right ad at the right time. Ads say<br>
nothing about the quality of the product, they are the commercial <br>
equivalent of smooth talking politicians. A smooth ad campaign can<br>
make people buy crap and make them ignore the good stuff, who's <br>
inventor didn't happen to have an extra $10,000,000 to advertize it all <br>
over the place. Also, sometimes good products are suppressed <br>
because they threaten the position of some big powerful company<br>
that happens to operate in the same niche. Only a powerful state<br>
can put these things right, thus achieving a higher level of progress<br>
and product quality for the consumer to enjoy. Sometimes market<br>
forces just aren't enough, and a healthy dose of ideology is required.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The free market is basically commercial democracy: you let the         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;people vote for products.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, there is a fundamental difference. Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; communicating your wishes, there are much better ways. Every day I send </i><br>
<i>&gt; hundreds of exquisitely precise messages to the Free Market telling it what I </i><br>
<i>&gt; want it to do. </i><br>
<p>
Most consumers aren't as critical or emancipated as you are, they'll buy crap<br>
and vote crap, all the same to them. That's why there's so much crap around.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I also get to compare brands, I can't do that In a democracy </i><br>
<i>&gt; because I'm not voting for goods or services or even policies, I just get to</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose between two grab bags of promises every 4 years, and democracy is the </i><br>
<i>&gt; best form of government, the best of a bad lot.</i><br>
<p>
For the time being, yes.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; When I "vote" in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; always win. </i><br>
<p>
Unless you buy crap of course.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not </i><br>
<i>&gt; worth my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; politician with the best hairdo gets to make the decisions.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, democracy sucks and I should rule the world.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;First of all, how do you want to achieve a state of anarchy? After       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;all, the nation states aren't going to roll over and die just like       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't need to achieve it, like it or not I see no way to stop it. I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; we'll soon find out if my optimistic assessment of a world without government </i><br>
<i>&gt; is correct, because I don't see how the traditional nation state can continue </i><br>
<i>&gt; much longer, they will go the way of the city state.</i><br>
<p>
City states were absorbed by nation states, so you're saying that we're about<br>
to have a gobal state. That's indeed a considerable possibility, which would make<br>
the net a lot more controllable, btw.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Nations will die not with a bang but with a whimper because modern worldwide  </i><br>
<i>&gt; communication, cryptography and untraceable digital cash and signatures will  </i><br>
<i>&gt; make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes, the balance is tipping away  </i><br>
<i>&gt; from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader.  </i><br>
<p>
Sounds o.k, but many other seemingly good predictions about the demise of<br>
the state have turned out to be duds so I'll don't hold my breath just yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves  </i><br>
<i>&gt; in this brave new world, but making rules is easy, enforcing them is not.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Short of dismantling the Internet and confiscating all home computers it's  </i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible to dictate what form of encryption or digital cash you must use  </i><br>
<i>&gt; in your home. Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't  </i><br>
<i>&gt; find the  money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would </i><br>
<i>&gt; not work as  people would just switch to a competing currency (untraceable of </i><br>
<i>&gt; course) that  suited their needs better. The tribute that could still be </i><br>
<i>&gt; extracted, like property taxes and building permits, would have to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; increased to astronomic  levels and collected with a heavy hand, I think a</i><br>
<i>&gt; tax revolt would follow.  Without money government will grind to a halt.          </i><br>
                                          <br>
<p>
I must say it sounds convincing, but somehow I don't think that it will be<br>
this simple. People are more obedient and scared of anarchy than you<br>
think, and the state will prey on their fears to curb the flow of untaxable<br>
transactions. After all, with full control over the real world (where you live<br>
and can get hurt etc.) and with the same problem facing all governments<br>
they'll have the motivation and probably also the means to turn the tide<br>
of coming anarchy. In the worst case scenario violence and another<br>
cold war and/or increased terrorist activity (all set up of course) may be<br>
used to justify all sorts of draconanian measures, and the sheeple _will_<br>
take it once more. If they tolerate such crap as the "war on drugs", then<br>
why not this too? Sanctimoniousness and fear can so easily be exploited...<br>
If this fails, there may be temporary _violent_ anarchy indeed -- followed <br>
by good old totaltarianism. I can assure you that to stay in power the<br>
governments of the worlds will sacrifice almost any number of lives and<br>
new technologies, including the net. If nothing else works they'll simply<br>
hit it so hard that it will be reduced to what it once was: a toy for a small<br>
number of techno buffs. Brute force gets you a long way.<br>
<p>
          <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Centralized governments don't *have* to  be bureaucratic. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think they do, certainly they always have been. If you're a bureaucrat it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; to your interest to increase the bureaucracy, the same is true of your boss.</i><br>
<p>
Any employee has interest in the prospering of his company. Whether that's<br>
the state, PPA, or some other business isn't really relevant. Like I said before,<br>
government workers (like police etc.) would be paid according to the amount<br>
and quality of their work, and be fired when found inadequate, just like in any<br>
market-oriented company. This and maximal automatization should elliminate<br>
most of the problems associated with bureaucrats. <br>
          <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"Anarchy" in any form is unstable (it's simply a power vacuum), </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anarchy means no government, your statement would be true only if government </i><br>
<i>&gt; was the only form of power, fortunately it's not. </i><br>
<p>
It also quite appropriately means "social and political disorder". The main point is<br>
however that a power structure where the relation between payment and service<br>
is vague (like it is with government and taxes) seems to be the most "natural" one<br>
for humans. Time and again we have seen social experiments fail, even if the<br>
basic principles may have seemed sound. I'm quite sure your PPAs would either<br>
be a minority from the start (the rest being totalitarian clans, citystates and<br>
full- blown countries) or that many, possibly all, would quickly degenerate into a<br>
flock of hardworking, meek/scared sheep ruled by an elite of enforcers. Logical,<br>
because many people are insecure, uneducated and vulnerable to any slick<br>
talker or bully with a gun. In *theory* you might move from a region if you don't<br>
like the resident PPA, but in reality it may proof too difficult/dangerous. I think<br>
the advocates of anarcho-capitalism badly overestimate the rationality and <br>
emancipation and (practical means like income) of the average man. And I<br>
assure you, there are a *lot* of average and sub-average men out there. I can<br>
hear the new Hitler smack his lips already...<br>
          <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Since there's only your PPA to deal with instead of a huge government    </i><br>
    <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that's all over I might try to take you out either myself or I may       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;hire as many destitute souls as my budged allows to do it for me. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would not have dreamed of slandering you, or even set foot outside of my </i><br>
<i>&gt; house if I didn't think my PPA was strong enough to deter you or anybody else  </i><br>
<i>&gt; from killing me. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, the strongest PPA wins. Well, this reminds me that even without full-flung<br>
turf wars there can be hostile takeovers and the like, one PPA directly<br>
(and secretly) damaging the reputation (sabotage) of another, causing some people<br>
to leave it etc, and then buying its owners out and absorbing it (with enough of<br>
its structure and customer base in tact to make a profit) or simply disbanding it.<br>
Of course financial problems could also arise due to other causes which would<br>
spare the "hostile" PPA a lot of trouble. Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex, <br>
providing mediocre yet somehow "appealing" services and taking out competition<br>
left and right by any means necessary. Such a PPA would become more like<br>
a nation state with every takeover or alliance it achieved. Indeed, this is the way<br>
that today's great nation states were formed...slowly, by force, by cunning and<br>
sheer luck.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A member being murdered is bad business for a PPA, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; murderer remaining unpunished is VERY bad business for a PPA. If I though </i><br>
<i>&gt; that my PPA  wasn't pulling out all the stops in its investigation of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; murdered member  I'd change my PPA so fast it'd make your head spin. </i><br>
<p>
*If* you're indeed in a position to do so. I can well image that many folks would<br>
have debts with their PPA, just like with the mob/state etc.No way that you<br>
will leave in one piece, and even if so what other PPA would dare/want to <br>
accept you in this state...unless you make even more debts and become <br>
in fact a slave. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Incidentally, my PPA  forbids torture but not the death penalty.</i><br>
<p>
Since mine allows both (under certain circumstances) I can imagine would-be<br>
criminals being better behaved on my turf, and a generally more polite treatment<br>
of my customers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;I don't understand. Does everybody get 3 trials, even those found       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;guilty the  first time?                </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;No. Unless new hard evidence comes up (before the execution in         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;capital cases).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I must go to trial 3 times and receive 3 innocent verdicts before I can go </i><br>
<i>&gt; home but if I receive only one guilty verdict I'm dead meat. Doesn't seem  </i><br>
<i>&gt; quite right.</i><br>
<p>
It *does* make sense: normally, there's one trial and one verdict. To avoid <br>
endless appeals on death row and the trouble they cause to all parties<br>
involved, executions must follow within a relatively short period after the verdict.<br>
Within this period you have the right to appeal for a retrial, but only if there<br>
is new evidence. There is no limit to presenting new evidence in order to avoid <br>
rediculous situations where everyone knows that the defendant is innocent, but<br>
the crucial evidence has only been found after the 3rd retrial so he has to<br>
die anyway. The 3x limit only applies to the prosecution (in cases where<br>
the verdict was "not guilty"), in order to avoid a situation where someone<br>
has to face trial every couple of months for the same crime.<br>
          <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Which decision of the 3 trials do we accept? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The one that is best argued and supported by the most/hardest facts.     </i><br>
    <br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; That immediately brings to mind an obvious question, a question I have asked </i><br>
<i>&gt; of you before but received no answer, a question so obvious I won't repeat it.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know if this is what yo mean, but yes, I belief there are such things as <br>
objective facts and well-argued cases. Without this assumption, there can <br>
simply be no justice system.<br>
<p>
All in all, the moral of the whole story is: PPAs and other anarcho-capitalist<br>
goodies may be great in *theory*, but are in fact ivory tower productions that<br>
don't take human nature into account and will thus fail as have many before<br>
them. Most people are no libertarians, and have not the slightest intention<br>
of becoming libertarians. Hell, many so-called "libertarians" are probably<br>
wolves in sheep's clothing (or sheep in wolf's clothing) when it comes down<br>
to it. If people want the state, well let them have it! You can always move<br>
to a private island if you're really serious about your freedom, and later even<br>
to outer space...Back on earth, I think a centralized and maybe somewhat<br>
totalitarian system based on values of maximal freedom (allow anything as <br>
long as no-one gets hurt without consent) is the best way to go. Utopic?<br>
Sure. But not any more than anarcho capitalism. The former may fail because<br>
of corruption of the leadership, while the latter fails because the common<br>
man just ain't no libertarian (just like he ain't no communist either -- that's<br>
why *that* idea failed).  <br>
<p>
I'll eat my cap if I'm wrong on this one.<br>
