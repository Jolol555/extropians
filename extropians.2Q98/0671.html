<i>&gt;Being omnipotent = being responsible for all that</i><br>
<i>&gt;happens.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Is real omnipotence actually possible? With reference to which environment?<br>
How can you know that there are no other physical environments than those<br>
you can create and dwell in? Certainly, entities can become so powerful that<br>
they would *seem* omnipotent to us. Just like horsemen could seem like<br>
halfgods to people who have never seen horses or cars. But real omnipotence?<br>
I cannot think of a single point of existence when it would be reached.<br>
