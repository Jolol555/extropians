Definitely! <br>

However, I have to question whether low intelligence indicates a 'chaotic'<br>
view. I would expect the lower intelligence would entail a simpler view of<br>
the world. A child begins with a simple view of things around him, and adds<br>
complexity as he grows and learns. A less intelligent person does not learn<br>
as quickly, and would be less sophisticated in his views.<br>
