<i>&gt;Ever time I have seen you try to attack free markets with any sort of logic</i><br>
<i>&gt;or empirical evidence, that logic and evidence is flawlessy refuted by</i><br>
<i>&gt;members of this list,(eg. John Clark, Lee Daniel Crocker, Anton Sherwood)</i><br>
<i>&gt;who cite a larger body of contradictory evidence and well-thought-out logic</i><br>
<i>&gt;which supports the benefits of a free market.</i><br>
<p>
Every time I have attacked free markets with any sort of logic or empirical<br>
evidence, I have only gotten opinion and personal experience as a response.<br>
_Not a single time_, I have received statistics or quoted sources.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You come along, telling everyone that playing or even</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking about playing without red goo is not only in error, but bordering</i><br>
<i>&gt;on fascism.</i><br>
<p>
Retranslated: I come along, tell everyone that being an Extropian or even<br>
thinking about being an Extropian is not only in error, but bordering on<br>
fascism.<br>
<p>
Where have I done that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You drop a couple book names (maybe Noam Chomsky is a linguist</i><br>
<i>&gt;and a baseball player?),</i><br>
<p>
Noam Chomsky has written a very important analysis of the effects of media<br>
on people. I consider him as one of the most important thinkers of today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and throw out a bunch of red-goo propaganda that has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been heard by everyone on the list a million times over.</i><br>
<p>
Namely?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your points are destroyed by evidence</i><br>
<p>
Namely?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You also accuse the creator</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the Extropian No-Goo Baseball List of being a cult leader because he</i><br>
<i>&gt;created a list that does not involve talking about red goo, and because</i><br>
<i>&gt;*some* people on the list have opinions on red goo that contradict yours.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Retranslated:<br>
<p>
I accuse the creator of the Extropian maling list of being a cult leader<br>
because he created a list that does not involve criticizing Extropy, and<br>
because some people on the list have opinions on Extropy that contradict<br>
mine.<br>
<p>
I have retracted from calling the creator of the Extropian mailing list a<br>
cult leader.<br>
I have not retracted from calling Extropy a cult, one of the reasons for<br>
this was that criticism was not allowed on the Extropy mailing list. I am<br>
still waiting for a reply by Max on this to find out the current status, but<br>
right now, it looks good.<br>
<p>
I have presented other reasons for calling Extropy a cult, and you say that<br>
I am<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;contorting the meaning of cult</i><br>
<i>&gt;until it basically describes every philosophy ever postulated, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;yours.</i><br>
<p>
Don't you think that Webster's is a valid reference for defining a cult?<br>
I don't care about what you think  a cult is or should be, I care about what<br>
it is defined to be, and by this general definition, Extropy is a cult.<br>
Period. Maybe transhumanism is a cult, too, and the red-goo baseball players<br>
are also cultish. Cults are part of culture.<br>
<p>

Erik Moeller<br>
