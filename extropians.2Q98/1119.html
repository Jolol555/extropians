 Is there a private entity that would be willing to sell such insurance<br>
and have a high probability of surviving the disruption well enough to<br>
pay off?<br>
 Can the conditions under which this insurance would be paid off be<br>
specified well enough to distinguish from conditions where the insuree<br>
is simply too lazy to try hard enough to get a job?<br>
 (It isn't clear why people who want the government to provide the insurance<br>
are confident that using the government allows them to ignore these questions.)<br>
<p>
 I think half of the argument is over providing insurance to those who<br>
appear to lack the foresight to realize that the risks are unusually high.<br>
