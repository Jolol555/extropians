For several reasons, starting your own nation would be the best <br>
option if you want real change real quick (before the singularity).<br>
Otherwise, prepare for sometimes decades-long struggles for<br>
usually very modest changes. <br>

Yes, it's such a shame that all these people are at the brink<br>
of enlightenment, but for some reason don't make the final step.<br>
Transhumanism linked to a practical (based on facts) socio-political<br>
worldview would be unbeatable, the best ideology ever. For example,<br>
wealth and power are extremely important to reach "higher" goals,<br>
or even to simply survive the coming changes, so let's stop treating <br>
them as "dirty" words. The meek shall inherit the earth (if they're<br>
lucky) - the bold everything else.<br>
