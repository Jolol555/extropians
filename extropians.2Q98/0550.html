<i>&gt; From:          Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We</i><br>
<i>&gt; could likely make an unicorn today (some creative surgery or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetic hybridization with a horned species) but it wouldn't prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are unicorns.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it would prove that there ARE unicorns.  (And, in fact, there <br>
are.  It's a weird abnormality in goats, that the roots of their two <br>
horns are very close together in the center of the forehead, so close <br>
that the horns actually grow together; their being so close together <br>
interferes with their growth pattern so they usually end up with <br>
straighter horns than is normal for goats of their species -- this <br>
has been seen in a couple different species.  Very rare, only a few <br>
cases known to have occurred, and AFAIK nobody has bought two and <br>
tried to breed them so we don't know if the abnormality breeds true.  <br>
And of course, aside from the oddity of the horns, unicorns are <br>
perfectly ordinary goats.  Not immortal, not the good/evil beings of <br>
various mythologies, not more intelligent than one would expect of a <br>
goat, no odd magical properties, their horns don't cure illness or <br>
injury, they don't have a thing about virgins -- or at least not <br>
HUMAN virgins.)<br>
<p>
It would NOT prove that there WERE unicorns in, say, classical Greek <br>
times.  (Not even one of those abnormal goats.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, there is some rather hot debate about whether nanobacteria do</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist or not. So if we could produce nanobacteria the question about</i><br>
<i>&gt; their impossibility could at least be settled.</i><br>
