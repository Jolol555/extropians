<p>
Not a whole lot.  <br>
<p>
But the Sphinx has quite a lot of rain erosion on <br>
its back -- even considering how old it was formerly believed to be.  <br>
Indicating that substantially more rain has fallen on it than has <br>
fallen on any similarly-sized nearby patch of land in that period of <br>
time.  <br>
<p>
The most plausible explanation is that the Sphinx is older than was <br>
formerly believed.  If you just slide the date back to account for <br>
the erosion, you cross a period in which we are pretty sure the <br>
climate in that area changed -- before this period, that area was <br>
*not* desert, and got substantially more rain than it gets today.  <br>
<p>
The problem is, you also go past the period in which civilization is <br>
believed to have come to Egypt.<br>
