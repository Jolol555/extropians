[I'm writing today during breaks from the heat and Mexican smoke storm outside<br>
as I continue to build the "mega-deck" in the back yard, so please excuse if<br>
my coherence suffers as the day wears on . . .]<br>

<p>
Very well summarized -- it's a pleasure doing business with you, sir.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  We appear to disagree on the boundary between "simple" and "complex".</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I place a desktop-sized supercomputer factory in the "simple" category.</i><br>
<p>
I have to laugh at this -- only in Extropia could this comment be made so<br>
casually. . . is this a great list or what?  Seriously, I place it in the<br>
"simple" category only IF the designs are available.  Perhaps "simple" is<br>
exactly the right word, but "widespread" is not.  It depends on intellectual<br>
property law and custom.  If Intel and the other current manufacturers can<br>
keep their designs protected, then it might be some while before it becomes<br>
widespread.  I suppose a cadre of "freeware" chip designers could break the<br>
logjam here, but they'd have to be able to show they designed their chips from<br>
scratch and didn't incorporate IP owned by the Big Boys.  But the PRICE of<br>
desktop-manufactured computers would definitely drop drastically, with many<br>
concomitant effects.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I can't tell for sure, but you seem to disagree? It would be fun to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  rank-order a set of parts or devices and see where each of us places</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the boundary. We could each place the rank-ordered devices on a timeline,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  except we both agree that a breakthrough is needed, more or less implying a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bimodal distribution.</i><br>
<p>
I may take a stab at this on my next break . . .<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  I also believe that there is at least a chance that the availability of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  nanotech-built massively parallel supercomputers will enable a path to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  AI, which in turn could permit a nanotech control system that can enable</i><br>
<i>&gt;  us to build complicated stuff. You appear to think this unlikely?</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily unlikely, but definitely not certain.  I agree that it will<br>
make HARDWARE cheap and progress in hardware very fast.  However, I don't see<br>
the necessary link to the development of SOFTWARE.  That's where the<br>
disagreement is, I think.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  We also disagree on the rate of adoption of even the "simple stuff"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  technology. I feel that the rate will be very rapid, while you think</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it will take a decade. In essence, I feel that after the time that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  first macro-scale part (brick, tennis racket handle, whatever) there will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be no new orders for new non-nanotech capital equipment, and within a year</i><br>
<i>&gt;  most simple hard-good parts will be diamondoid.</i><br>
<p>
I strongly disagree.  Existing capital equipment won't disappear.  To a great<br>
extent, the existing physical plant at the time of "simple stuff nanotech"<br>
represents sunk costs.  Owners of those goods will continue to use them, but<br>
at a developing competitive disadvantage.  It won't make sense to replace the<br>
entire manufacturing plant of the earth in a year.  Capital equipment life<br>
cycles WILL shorten and the old tools will be replaced with much more<br>
efficient ones more quickly than they otherwise would have, due to the<br>
financial incentive to "get with the program", but the old technology will<br>
continue to be a drag for ten years, although less so toward the end,<br>
obviously.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In the same time, </i><br>
<i>&gt; nanocomputing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will completely supercede microlithographic-based computing.</i><br>
<p>
Yes -- chip manufacture will be effected most quickly, as the disincentive to<br>
maintain old methods of production will be brutal.<br>
