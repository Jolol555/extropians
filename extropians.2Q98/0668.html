A libertarian perspective on the governmental assault on Microsoft.  <br>

<p>
Excerpt:<br>
<p>
The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition; that<br>
purpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulated market<br>
will inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, in<br>
fact, no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means<br>
of free trade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by<br>
government intervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as<br>
franchises or subsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given<br>
field, by legislative action. (For a full demonstration of this fact, I<br>
refer you to the works of the best economists.) The Antitrust laws were the<br>
classic example of a moral inversion prevalent in the history: an example of<br>
the victims, the businessmen, taking the blame for the evils caused by<br>
government, and the government using its own guilt as a justification for<br>
acquiring wider powers, on the pretext of "correcting" the evils.<br>
