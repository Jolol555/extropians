 HF&gt; Speaking of "animal rights" lumps all animals together, but in fact<br>
 HF&gt; there are many differences among animals.  Not all animals eat<br>
 HF&gt; others, for example.<br>
<p>
I don't see how this relates.  I've noticed many of the biggest and baddest<br>
predators tend to be the species admired most by humans.  What this says about<br>
us, I don't know.<br>
<p>
 HF&gt; It also suggests that there are only two cases, animals with full<br>
 HF&gt; human rights and animals with none.  Actually it would make more<br>
 HF&gt; sense to propose that animals should have some rights.  Most<br>
 HF&gt; states protect animals against cruelty, for example,<br>
<p>
As a Libertarian, I would argue such laws exist not because animals are<br>
considered to have "rights", but rather because some humans simply find these<br>
activities unpleasant.  It's the same way we get misguided laws against<br>
gambling, prostitution, possession of narcotics, and other victimless crimes.<br>
