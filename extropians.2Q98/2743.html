<i>&gt; &gt; What do you think?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I want one...</i><br>
<p>
Me too! :-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The cost for building the country is $216,439,000,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which seems quite cheap to me (although well out</i><br>
<i>&gt; of my price range).  Giving some ingenuity I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; it would be possible to raise enough cash to build</i><br>
<i>&gt; offshore Extropia. </i><br>
<p>
In fact, relatively cheap as it is, you could start a<br>
"country" for much less. Just three platforms or so<br>
and/or some old ships to start you up. If it's mobile,<br>
you can open a floating Las Vegas outfit in just about<br>
any part of the world as long as you stay outside the<br>
20-mile jurisdiction. The ideal combination would be<br>
an artificial island somewhere beyond the 200-mile<br>
EEZs as a permanent, and completely free place to<br>
live, while modified (old) ships (a medium-sized<br>
cruise ship in good condition can sometimes be<br>
bought for 2-3 million $ or less - and you can start<br>
out with for example Russian freighters or navy vessels<br>
which are cheaper still) are used to make money near <br>
population centers. This way you can have your cake <br>
and eat it too. As your income grows, the island grows.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Instead of having a</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitutional monarchy, I would have a complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; free market, i.e. you buy your office/house, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's yours.  No taxes, no laws, just pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism.  </i><br>
<p>
In any case there would have to be some agreements regarding <br>
island defense, pollution &amp; other damaging behaviour etc.<br>
Rudimentary laws, but nothing like modern bureaucracies, of<br>
course. Just the "golden rule" &amp; some practical stuff.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Start off with the monopoly on PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt; services, etc. and then invite other companies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; join in.  Anyone want to help out?</i><br>
<p>
Sure, I'd love to be involved in such a project. As I <br>
explained in other mails, the advantages of having your<br>
own country are enormous, especially for transhumnists/<br>
cryonicists.<br>
