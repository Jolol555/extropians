In a message dated 98-06-24 15:49:39 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Religion is trying to help humans in their<br>
 lives, but not forcing them to believe &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Since when?  Every major religion on this planet has as a core tenet some<br>
variation on the theme that if you are not "of them" you will suffer some<br>
horrific consequence and instructs its followers to go out and "save" those<br>
who are non-believers.  Missionaries have as one of their main goals the<br>
conversion of "infidels" into believers.  Religions and the practioners<br>
thereof have routinely and consistently attempted to control the behaviour of<br>
all peoples, not just those who are its follwers.<br>
<p>
While it is certainly true that for some people religion, with its customs,<br>
rituals, and tradition, brings stability, comfort, and peace of mind, all to<br>
often they insist that I and all others embrace their need and their belief<br>
system.  <br>
<p>
It has been said on this list that it is only fanatics who act in this manner,<br>
yet I can offer you an easy experiment to demonstrate otherwise.  Wear a t-<br>
shirt out some weekend with a religious message printed on it..Jesus Saves or<br>
some such.  You will rarely if at all be remarked upon.  Go out the next<br>
weekend wearing a t-shirt with an anti-religious statement on it.  Observe the<br>
difference in the behaviour of those around you.  I don't think you'll like<br>
the comments you will receive.<br>
<p>
For those who think that my life is an empty meaningless shell with out some<br>
god(s) to worship I can only say that it simply isn't so.  I have neither the<br>
time nor the desire to attempt to "prove" this to you.  All I ask of<br>
religionists is to leave me alone and stop using thier beliefs to legislate my<br>
life.  If you think none do, then you haven't read the papers lately.  (Sen.<br>
Nickles statement that Mr. Hormel is unfit to represent the US as an<br>
Ambassador because, and only because, he is a homosexual. That ought to scare<br>
the bejabbers out of anyone with half a mind.)<br>
<p>
Thanks all, Cori<br>
