Commentary from The Lancet 351: 1598-1599 May 30,1998<br>
By Adrian Harris, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Univerisity of Oxford<br>

Quote from text:<br>
<p>
   "In experiments, administration of angiostatin inhibited growth of<br>
primary tumours and metastases. Inhibition of metastases was by a novel<br>
mechanism, prevention of blood-vessel formation, so the tumour cells grew<br>
at the same rate but died much more rapidly by apoptosis, because of lack<br>
of oxygen and nutrients. Endostatin caused nearly complete regression of<br>
established tumours, but tumours regrew when therapy was stopped. However,<br>
surprisingly after several rounds of therapy, residual cells did not regrow<br>
but remained dormant. This effect occurred also in tumours extremely<br>
resistant to chemotherapy. Thus, despite residual cells, endostatin was<br>
highly effective, and its combination with angiostatin may be even more so.<br>
These data have not been published, and a few weeks ago an optimistic<br>
newspaper report based on these findings stimulated a flurry of publicity<br>
and changes in share prices.<br>
  Are angiostatin and endostatin the cure for cancer? There are many<br>
problems to be solved. Initially scale-up of the production of proteins is<br>
necessary, and in the studies with endostatin "unrefolded" protein had to<br>
be used. Recombinant angiostatin has been made on a small scale, and recent<br>
publication of the crystal structure of endostatin may help in the<br>
development  of smaller molecules and peptides with activity. The receptors<br>
or targets are unknown and may not be expressed on human tumour vessels or<br>
to the same extent as in murine vessels. The animal tumours were very small<br>
compared with the tumours in patients eligible for phase I trials. The<br>
human pharmacokinetics may make the proteins difficult to deliver, and if<br>
receptors or mechanisms were known, more appropriate drugs may be<br>
developed. Thus these proteins are far from being ready for clinical use."<br>
