"The Effect of Soup on Satiation"<br>
<p>
Abstract:<br>
<p>
   We compared the influence of three solid/liquid preloads to a no-preload<br>
condition given at lunchtime on hunger ratings and energy intake of the<br>
lunch and subsequent dinner in 12 lean and 10 overweight young men. The<br>
preloads (vegetables and water, strained vegetable soup, chunky soup) were<br>
of the same composition and volume but differed in distribution of<br>
nutrients between the liquid and the solid phases, and in the size of solid<br>
particles. Hunger ratings were reduced by the preloads; there was a<br>
significantly greater suppression of hunger after the chunky soup than<br>
after the vegetables and water. In both groups, the soups reduced energy<br>
intake at lunch, although the chunky soup had the most effect. In the<br>
overweight subjects, a reduced lunch intake was also followed by a reduced<br>
dinner intake. The benefit to weight control of large particles in soup<br>
should be evaluated.<br>
<p>
Additional quote from the text of the report:<br>
<p>
  "Two main results emerged from the present study. In both groups of<br>
subjects, consumption of 397 kJ (95 kcal) of either vegetables or a<br>
strained vegetable or chunky soup as the first course of a meal reduced the<br>
total energy intake at that meal with respect to the no-preload condition.<br>
Although the reduction was slight and not significant after the vegetables<br>
and strained vegetable soup, a significant reduction of around 20% of total<br>
intake was noted after the chunky soup.<br>
  Second, in the overweight subjects whose lunch intake had been reduced by<br>
the chunky soup preload, intake at the subsequent dinner was also<br>
significantly reduced (-12% relative to the no-preload condition). Thus in<br>
the overweight subjects, the consumption of the chunky soup used as the<br>
first course of an ad libitum lunch led to a significant 15% decrease in<br>
the total energy intake at lunch and dinner."<br>
<p>
Last paragraph of the report:<br>
<p>
  "Soup consumption and particularly consumption of soups containing solid<br>
particles resistant to trituration may be beneficial in weight reduction<br>
programmes, provided that the phenomenon is not subject to habituation. The<br>
finding of Jordan et al. (1981) that weight loss was significantly<br>
correlated with the frequency of soup consumption over a 10-week period<br>
suggests that the phenomenon is not short-lived."<br>
