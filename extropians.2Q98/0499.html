For a vehicle in orbit, whether it's above or below ground, there is no<br>
force on it that would require rails, etc. for guidance. In reality, some<br>
sort of maglev would probably be used to ensure the car remained centered<br>
inside the tube.<br>
<p>
The smaller the radius, the faster the orbital velocity. This would not make<br>
much difference between running the tunnels underground or above ground, but<br>
underground the least objections would be raised over right-of-way. Advances<br>
in tunnelling technology are making this more and more attractive.<br>
<p>
The basic system would use a linear motor to accelerate a sealed capsule in<br>
an evacuated tube. Once orbital speed is reached, no further power is<br>
required. At the far terminal, the energy in the capsule would be recovered<br>
in another linear motor.<br>
<p>
There have been airpressure systems proposed, but I believe they all suffer<br>
from massive frictional losses when the velocity rises to a point where it<br>
would be competitive with existing transport..<br>
<p>
One thing that is problematical is how to transverse fault lines such as in<br>
California. Large caverns with articulated guide tubes have been mentioned.<br>
I read about this a few years back, but i don't remember where.<br>
