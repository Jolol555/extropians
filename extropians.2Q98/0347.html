<i>&gt; From: Jim Hart &lt;jqhart@hotmail.com&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; There has been a lot of hype about colonizing space, the oceans, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; other physical frontiers.  American culture and perhaps even human </i><br>
<i>&gt; instinct equate freedom with the physical frontier.  Some government </i><br>
<i>&gt; bureaucracy  finds 1% water at a lunar pole and  some libertarians, </i><br>
<i>&gt; recalling those old entertaining industrial-era yarns about a dreamy </i><br>
<i>&gt; future on the Moon (a.k.a. heaven),  go gaga.   I have  more water, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; more  of  almost everything else useful, in my literal backyard!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Supposedly, mere physical distance, the mere increase of a constant </i><br>
<i>&gt; factor  in the energy and time needed to get across the oceans </i><br>
<i>&gt; or into space, is supposed to provide some protection from the thieves </i><br>
<i>&gt; and parasites who first steal our livelihoods through taxes, then steal </i><br>
<i>&gt; our very lives by harassing practitioners of advanced medicine. But the </i><br>
<i>&gt; increased cost of a physical barrier is the same for both the offense </i><br>
<i>&gt; and the defense.  Such a barrier offers no significant improvement to </i><br>
<i>&gt; those wishing to defend their freedoms.  Only a barrier of great </i><br>
<i>&gt; asymmetry, where defense is vastly more efficient than offense, turns </i><br>
<i>&gt; the tides towards freedom.   Freedom in cypherspace, first for our </i><br>
<i>&gt; communications, then for our financial transactions, then for the free </i><br>
<i>&gt; flow of research and services from unlocatable medical laboratories.</i><br>
<p>
"Colonizing" cypherspace is all nice and well, but it certainly isn't<br>
a substitute for good old space colonization. At the end of the day<br>
governments can still pull the plug on your virtual world using a lot<br>
less resources than they would need to destroy a stronghold in<br>
space. Also it would be extremely unwise not to have some viable<br>
offplanet colonies in case of a large disaster (be it natural or man-<br>
induced). <br>
<p>
In cyberspace you have to rely on stealth; the idea is that the <br>
government can't catch you if they don't know where you are<br>
or what you're doing. That's very tricky, because it means that<br>
a little slip in security procedures can expose you, and the gov<br>
(or others) have other means besides tracing email etc. to <br>
determine your location. And *when* they find you, you're<br>
a sitting duck. What good is freedom in cyberspace<br>
if you can't be free in the physical world? No, it's better to<br>
move to space a.s.a.p. and add the options of virtually<br>
unlimited relocation possibilities, great speed, big guns <br>
(nukes etc.) to the defense based on stealth. Not you but<br>
the governments of earth will then be the sitting ducks.<br>
