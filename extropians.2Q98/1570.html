<i>&gt; is inconsistent with QT, relativity, etc.</i><br>
<p>
  Psi is certainly not inconsistent with Quantum *Theory* -- which <br>
  predated Quantum _Mechanics_ by many years, and which subsumes Quantum <br>
  *Mechanics* (in its many guises) as an approximation theory.<br>
<p>
  As for psi being inconsistent with 'relativity' -- which Relativity?  <br>
  The Galilean Relativity of Classical Mechanics?  Or Special Relativity?  <br>
  Or maybe General Relativity?  Non-locality has destroyed SR and GR.<br>
<p>
  It is true that any phenomenon or effect which demonstrates Absolute <br>
  Simultaneity instantly demolishes Special and General Relativity.  This <br>
  is not merely a matter of 'signal transmissions' or whatever -- the <br>
  moment we find that one event in space and time is simultaneous with <br>
  another event in a different location within the same Cartesian <br>
  position-space, SR and GR are irretrievably destroyed as theories.  <br>
  Bell, Aspect etc. have of course done this anyway, so the assertion can <br>
  only refer to Galilean Relativity, or so it would seem.<br>
  <br>
  But there is nothing in Classical Mechanics and Galilean Relativity to <br>
  prohibit any particular psi characteristic (mode of force transmission, <br>
  velocity of signal propagation).  All Classical Mechanics will demand is <br>
  exact conformance with Conservation of Mass and Energy.  Since Mass and <br>
  Energy are not interconvertible (except insofar as all matter consists <br>
  of the constituents of photons; and all energy is either kinetic or <br>
  potential) there is no physical obstale to telekinesis, telepathy etc. <br>
  Precognition poses a different problem -- you can argue that <br>
  precognition is a form of approximated extrapolated estimate of future <br>
  states; or you can argue a causal connection.<br>
<p>

<p>
  Except for those who have an a priori necessity to believe in the <br>
  non-existence of psi phenomena (some people don't _want_ 'their' <br>
  Universe to have these characteristics), it's really quite easy to find <br>
  out whether you have psi powers -- the Silva Mind Control courses offer <br>
  a money-back guarantee that they will train you to elicit these powers <br>
  in fully demonstrable form to your own satisfaction.  Clicker on my Home <br>
  Page.  Start by reading 'the Silva Mind Control Method' by Jose Silva <br>
  and Philip Miehle.  (Disclaimer: I have no financial conncention with <br>
  Silva).<br>
<p>
<p>
  If you have problems relaxing or visualising, one of the brain-frequency <br>
  entrainment gadgets will take care of the problem neatly.  It can also <br>
  help you get to sleep, by entraining Delta brain frequencies.<br>
