<i>&gt;&gt;IAN: It's an interesting area of inquiry:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;does the "-" negative notion equate 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with the "-" logical not notion? What's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;your case that "negative =/= not"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;?not? is a universal set theoretic operator, whilst ?-? is an operator</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is usually associated with Paeno systems/sets.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: That doesn't establish that we <br>
   cannot say that the "-" in -A (as in <br>
   not-A) and in -4 are compatible with one<br>
   another. There are cases for and against<br>
   that, but as I see you're not inclined<br>
   to make a case to support your claim, <br>
   I guess we'll just leave it at that.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Criterion for inclusion in "A"</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; x is a part of A, IF x is necessary for </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the specific existence/identity of A. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If this criterion is valid, it then follows that as: </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;not-A is necessary for the existence of A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;therefore, not-A is a part of A. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;In the same fashion, A is a part of not-A. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;IF not-A is a part of A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;IF A is a part of not-A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;THEN A and not-A have the same parts. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ERGO: A = not-A</i><br>

<i>&gt;Wow ?.. there are so many holes in that stream of reasoning that I really</i><br>
<i>&gt;can?t be bothered pointing them all out (and please, don?t ask me to).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Taking the time to back up your<br>
   assertions is a drag, so I won't ask.<br>
   I guess A is A free from not-A and <br>
   that is that and no questions.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I?ve noted that you (and others) repeatedly use terms such as ?degree?,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and ?measure? - unfortunately these terms are only valid for sets where</i><br>
<i>&gt;these can have meaning (such as the set of Reals). For example, for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;set of operators O = {+, -, *}, where O is not a Paeno set, what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference between {+} and {-} ? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: That's tangential. Glad you <br>
   found the time to make a case that <br>
   really has nothing to do with the topic.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;?.. So A = -A and does not = -A at the same time in </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;different contexts. When mystics say A = -A (or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;something to that effect) they are referring to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a primordial context that maps the structure of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;identity. So what is this "mystical" context?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To state that ?A = -A?, where the context of the left side is different from</i><br>
<i>&gt;the context of the right side is logically invalid, and is an abuse of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;?=? sign. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: That's not what I said. <br>
