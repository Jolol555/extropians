 What nonsense. People believe whatever they are told. There are really<br>
 enough examples for this.<br>
 The Vietnam war, the Gulf war, WW I, WW II, the Watergate affair,<br>
 *anything*. There's no chance<br>
 that Saddam's people would ever revolt against him unless he loses control<br>
 of the media.<br>

I don't agree.  I remember that government in the US used to be held in rather<br>
hi regard.  In my observation the only people who hold government in high<br>
regard now IS the government and not all of them.  I know some government<br>
(state) employees personally and they are very cynical....it's just that the<br>
job is soooooo easy that they don't want to do anything else...that might<br>
require some effort...so they don't quit.  But their consciousness hurts them<br>
somewhat.<br>
