allsop@swttools.fc.hp.com (Brent Allsop) rearranged the electrons to say:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;	To me, you are making a critically mistaken assumption here.<br>
You are assuming that most of the evil is caused by people "treading<br>
their own path".  To me this is completely false.  If some homicidal<br>
maniac is killing people right and left it is clear that something is<br>
wrong.  I have faith that such a person isn't merely "treading his own<br>
path."  To me, these perpetrators of sin and madness are the ones that<br>
suffer the most, at least as much as any would be victims.  These are<br>
the ones towards which God is really, as Cori so eloquently put it,<br>
"one cruel bastard".&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
People who have free will make thier own decisions.  Thus they tread their own<br>
path.  These decisions are not neccesarily well informed, well reasoned, or<br>
even understood, by the vast majority of humanity.  Therefore a great deal of<br>
them cause pain, suffering, and "evil."  People with good intentions and<br>
incorrect data make decisions that have unexpected consequences.  Shit<br>
happens.  Were they better educated, better fed, more loved they would likely<br>
make better decisions.  You seem to think that because God doesn't force them<br>
to a better path, he's "one cruel bastard."  I submit to you that God(should<br>
he/she/it exist) does have a tool with which to better the lives of these poor<br>
suffering sods.  Us. <br>
<p>
There's an old joke about a Man who is trapped on the roof of his home during<br>
a flood. A boat comes by and offers to pick him up &amp; he says "No thanks, God<br>
will save me."  A helicopter drops a line, and he says  "No thanks, God will<br>
save me."   So anyway, he drowns.  When he appears up in heaven he looks at<br>
the Lord &amp; says.  "I had faith in you Lord, how could you let me down?"  And<br>
God says  "What are you talking about? I sent a boat &amp; a helicopter!"  So<br>
before you start blaming God for all the evil created by people, maybe you<br>
should ask yourself exactly how much have you done to reduce the amount of<br>
evil present in the world.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;	And most of the suffering death and dieing isn't at the hand<br>
of other humans.  Have you visited a hospital lately and seen all the<br>
miraculous curing from the hideous "acts of God" (i.e. disasters,<br>
disease, aging...) that goes on?  But then, maybe you think stuff like<br>
AIDS isn't an "act of god" but something people just plain deserve<br>
because of their particular chosen "path to tread"?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Better be careful there, that was dangerously close to an insult for someone<br>
who just disagrees with you.  Once again, if you want a life where nothing bad<br>
ever happens, you're welcome to apply for a position in the My Little Pony<br>
universe.  Crap happens because the universe is essentially an uncaring place.<br>
Diseases evolve thru the same process that evolved us,  hurricanes happen<br>
because the earth rotates arouynd the sun.  Airplanes crash thru human or<br>
mechanical error.  No matter what we do, the universe will always be a<br>
dangerous place to exist.  Even after I wake up from my cryonic vault, I won't<br>
expect to live forever.  Forever is too damn long, so the odd's are just<br>
against it.  In short, the same processes that allow us to evolve and to exist<br>
are the same processes that imperil us everyday.  You seem to want to ask God<br>
to change the rules now that we are old enough to understand how to play the<br>
game, just as a cranky three year old whines when daddy won't "let them win."<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;	My point is, if there is a God, someone must take the blame<br>
for all the evil.  You seem to want to place the blaim on us and<br>
insist that it is all required if we are to be allowed to "tread our<br>
own path".  I'm sorry, but dying a slow miserable and painful death is<br>
not my chosen path to tread, and I don't know anyone for whom it<br>
really is!  So please show me, God, how I may tread a different, less<br>
sinful path, because this is what I (and I believe everyone) really<br>
want.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Evil is as natural a condition of the world as disease.  We should struggle to<br>
overcome it as much as we struggle to overcome AIDS.  I don't hear most<br>
rational people asking God to eradicate disease.  What I expect is that thru<br>
hypothesis and experimentation, we will learn to eradicte AIDS on our own,<br>
without supernatural help. We have take the responsibilty for curing diseases<br>
without blaming ourselves for thier existence. I expect we should be able to<br>
do the same for evil, by educating the ignorant, curing the sociopaths, and<br>
illuminating the actions of those who would keep them hidden, either by way of<br>
Brin's Transparent Society or Halperin's Truth Machine.  You're already on the<br>
path.<br>
