The third and last cydonia picture has come in from MGS.  They missed<br>
what Hoagland calls the "fort", a triangular landform with a hollowed<br>
out center, but they got Hoagland's "city center" and "main pyramid".<br>
<p>
The pictures don't look any more artificial than the others, but they<br>
are quite spectacular in their own right.  I am looking at the bottom<br>
of <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD3/cydonia3m_mipl_bot.gif">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD3/cydonia3m_mipl_bot.gif</a> and<br>
the variety of formations is amazing.<br>
<p>
The region just to the left of the "fort", down towards the "main pyramid",<br>
has some very interesting terrain.  Hoagland described it like this in<br>
his study of the Viking prints:<br>
<p>
   "I noticed a small smudge between the Fort and the main pyramid that<br>
   I hadn't caught before, just southwest of the abrupt and maddening<br>
   cutoff of the 'rocket motor' aspect of the Fort.  I focused the<br>
   magnifying glass...<br>
<p>
   "And realized I was staring at a tiny pattern of honeycomb-like cells.<br>
<p>
   "Several seconds passed as I slowly comprehended what I was seeing.<br>
   Moving the magnifying glass down a bit I traced the 'honeycomb'<br>
   across the two-mile region which had nagged me for so long... and<br>
   saw the shadow of the main pyramid falling across this tiny region,<br>
   clearly outlining a raised, three-dimensional relief.<br>
<p>
   "And suddenly, it all fell into place.<br>
<p>
   "'Oh my God,' I said softly, in the night with no one to hear me<br>
   except the clock and the cat."<br>
<p>
Hoagland interpreted this region as an open-topped pyramid honeycombed<br>
with tiny cell-sized "rooms".  He goes on to describe it as a multi<br>
level structure, "decking" or "open girder framework" or "scaffolding".<br>
<p>
Now the new pictures reveal that actually this terrain is covered with<br>
small craters.  It is more heavily cratered than anything else I have<br>
seen in the Mars pictures, with craters touching craters in many places.<br>
It must be very old terrain, perhaps protected from erosion by the large<br>
structures nearby.  It is this cratered area, which was not visible in the<br>
Viking pictures as other than a hint of unusual texture in the surface,<br>
which Hoagland interpreted as a honeycombed structure.<br>
<p>
In a way it is to Hoagland's credit that his many hours of staring at<br>
the Viking pictures identified this region as unusual.  It's too bad<br>
though that he immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was an<br>
artificial construction.<br>
