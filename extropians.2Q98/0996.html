if you have mread the bible it read that, "over all the world there<br>
came a dark cloud and it rained for fourty days and fourty nights."<br>
Now this could be taken in several ways:<br>
1. their known world was the middle east.<br>
2. it realy rained over the whole world<br>
3. it was wrong?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Has anyone figured this out?  If there were an average rain storm occuring<br>
across the face of the entire planet for 40 days and nights, would that be<br>
enough to cover the world?  If not, how hard would it have had to rain?  Of<br>
course, if it doesn't make sense the theists can just say that god made it<br>
happen anyway.<br>
