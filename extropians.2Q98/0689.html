There is a 'pyramid' image on the Web somewhere, I think it's on Hoagland's<br>
site (I thought I bookmarked it but obviously didn't). Oddly, it looks a <br>
lot like a bunch of rocks.<br>

You know, when I predicted this face denial a few weeks ago I really didn't<br>
expect it would be as widespread as it seems to be. These people are really<br>
bizarre; alt.alien.* was a real hoot for the first few days after the<br>
pictures came out.<br>
