<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; I work with fundamental Christians. Although I have all the knowledge to</i><br>
refute their beliefs completely, I don't. Why should I interfere with other<br>
people's lives?&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To save them, mentally and physically?</i><br>
<p>
No way to do that in most cases, especially with fundmentalists. Take a look<br>
at the story of Masada: When they realized that what they believed in, that<br>
God would save them when their trouble was greatest, did not happen, they<br>
all killed themselves and each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You underestimate the power of the religion meme. It's almost impossible</i><br>
<i>&gt;to remove it; it gets stronger when attacked (the poor martyr sub-meme).</i><br>
<i>&gt;No amount of reason will suffice, god knows I've tried ;-) Should the</i><br>
<i>&gt;unthinkable happen (it's a miracle!) ...</i><br>
<p>
I wrote that you *could* destroy other people's lives with facts. It is<br>
certainly not a walk in the park, but it can happen.<br>
<p>
This especially applies to Christian religion which has one severe bug which<br>
can easily be exploited: Jesus. The historical Jesus, whose name was not<br>
Jesus but Zaddik or Zadduk, is an entirely different person than the one<br>
pictured in the Bible. Read "The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception" by Michael<br>
Baigent and Richard Leigh. I don't want to go on further as their might be<br>
Christians on this list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would call it leaving a serious mental condition untreated.</i><br>
<p>
But if the operation kills the patient?<br>
