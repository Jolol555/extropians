Are you sure you're not confusing Linux with Windows NT? I've read of<br>
many people who bought NT and then switched to Linux because NT was<br>
unusable, but few who bought Linux and switched to Windows.<br>
<p>
Anyway, there's an interesting report about NT and Unix at<br>
<a href="http://www.gartner.com/public/static/datapro/industry/indnews6.html">http://www.gartner.com/public/static/datapro/industry/indnews6.html</a>,<br>
which claims that 14% of the corporations they surveyed used Linux;<br>
that's hardly fringe.<br>
