<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The degree of suffering due to lack of material goods in the rural areas as<br>
compared to the misery in the high rises is a totally different flavor. The<br>
high rise inmates (I hesitate to say tenants) are the worst products of the<br>
welfare system. The public education system is simply a warehouse to store<br>
the kids until they can take their place on the streets.<br>
<p>
I have never understood how someone on welfare can get a cell phone, or a<br>
microwave, or any of the other big ticket luxury items - who would extend<br>
credit? Are all these the result of criminal or underground economy<br>
activities?<br>
<p>
In the rural areas you refer to, the majority of the poor are people who<br>
would love to get better (or any) jobs and do something to better their<br>
lives. The denizens of the high rise all too often are satisfied to sit<br>
back and coast on thier welfare checks. This is learned behavior, taught by<br>
the federal and state welfare agencies. The lesson is that if you get a<br>
job, you lose welfare benefits. If you have more kids, you get bigger<br>
payments. You are more likely to get money if you have kids and the father<br>
is no where to be found.<br>
<p>
I am sure that you will find rural poor with similar philosopies. However,<br>
the degree of concentration makes a huge difference in the environment.<br>
Gangs, for instance, are almost exclusively an urban phenomena.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The elevators, the number one reason (two and three as well)</i><br>
<i>&gt;elevators are broke in CHA buildings is because of the RESIDENTS,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the kids get in the shafts and rig them to ride up and down like</i><br>
<i>&gt;amusement park rides, the gangs get in and sabotage them so people</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to take the stairs and are easier to rob.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Or rape, or kill. I agree. The gangs rule the buildings. They consider the<br>
buildings their personal property, and the other inmates are their serfs. A<br>
modern feudal system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My former roommate was a CFD paramedic and used to take a bag of</i><br>
<i>&gt;our rock climbing gear with him on every shift, he ended up</i><br>
<i>&gt;rescuing two to three kids a week from these shafts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another friend was the elevator repair man for one of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;complexes, he used to take polaroids of the destruction every time</i><br>
<i>&gt;he serviced the elevators, then a second picture of the repaired</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism. He said it was not unusual to be fixing the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;elevators every day. The city took my friends company to court a</i><br>
<i>&gt;few years ago trying to charge them with fraud and improper</i><br>
<i>&gt;maintenance. My buddy's thousands of photos and meticulous record</i><br>
<i>&gt;keeping saved the day. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I long for the day the CHA pulls Robert Taylor and the other crime and<br>
moral poverty incubators down. So far, I have not heard any good plan for<br>
constructively relocating the inmates. Perhaps Wacker Drive will absorb<br>
them all..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I don't believe this rise in 'poverty' has anything to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;wealth and its' distribution. I think it has everything to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the way our government has handled traditional poverty. The 'war</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;on some drugs' is a prime candidate for blame here, as is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;welfare system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I partly agree that the welfare system is to blame as are various</i><br>
<i>&gt;Govt programs, even though well intentioned. The real blame goes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;a complete lack of personal responsibility.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
As a Libertarian, I heartily agree on the lack of responsibility. How can<br>
we correct this? The schools, as I mentioned, are almost useless for<br>
education, let alone teaching morals and ethics. I see some hope in the<br>
latest govt. practice of limiting lifetime welfare payments; this might<br>
force some people to rethink their lives, but it's going to take a few<br>
generations to weed out the diehard welfare queens, I am afraid.<br>
