From: Larry Timberlake &lt;l.timberlake@auckland.ac.nz&gt;<br>
Subject: LIBERTYLOOP: New Libz site<br>
<p>
Well!  Here it is, only a month or two past the originally proposed launch,<br>
and I'm pleased to announce that the new website is now operational at<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.libertarianz.org.nz">http://www.libertarianz.org.nz</a><br>
<p>
The key word being "operational", as opposed to "finished".  The only way it<br>
got there was for me to finally heed my own advice that a website is never<br>
"finished" -- it can always be improved -- but as the encyclopediast said, "If<br>
I were to await perfection, my work would never be published."<br>
<p>
So we have a lean machine on which to add some muscle and a few of the bells<br>
and whistles so beloved of Generation X.<br>
<p>
Now before you tell me what's missing, let me say what's coming next, more or<br>
less in order of priority:  First, I have heaps more links, some of them quite<br>
amusing and provacative but there were so many of the damn things by the time<br>
I finished checking that they worked, there wasn't time now to put them in an<br>
accessible or logical order.  Next, Ian Fraser has kindly agreed to provide a<br>
proper history for that page (to replace the picture), as soon as he's put<br>
this issue of the Liberty newsletter "to bed". After that, I want to put some<br>
of Lindsay and Bernard's past efforts for Craccum and Critic in the archives<br>
and add the PDF facility for our brochures so people out in the regions with a<br>
laser printer can download decent copies for redistribution. Finally, in the<br>
bells and whistles section, I'll be looking at adding some sound files and<br>
perhaps some Bumper Stickers you can print out and use.  It should keep me out<br>
of trouble for a while...<br>
<p>
I would especially like feedback from those on you on PCs using Internet<br>
Explorer. We're all on Macs here and although its been run through Netscape,<br>
Mosaic and IE for Mac, the only way we could test the PC version was by asking<br>
the Mac to emulate one (which they really hate doing at the best of times.)<br>
