The URL is correct. I'll bet that you got hosed by the line break in Sasha's <br>
message (so that by clicking or cutting and pasting, your URL didn't include <br>
the "rozen_.htm" on the end).<br>
<p>
I did read the article. What a piece of crap. He got quite a number of facts<br>
wrong, and didn't appear interested in surfing beyond the couple of web pages<br>
he looked at. What's more, he didn't even get the info right on the few pages<br>
he did look at.  (E.g., his sample survey of cryonicists consisted entirely<br>
of Ralph Merkle's links to home pages of some (26) fellow cryonicists. He <br>
claims 25 of them are male, citing Kennita as the only female. I can only <br>
assume that he didn't follow the links, since he missed Ailing Freeman, <br>
Chris Peterson, and Terry Stanley, females all).<br>
<p>
I'm probably going to send him an email message. Hopefully, I can muster<br>
enough<br>
diplomacy that he'll consider printing corrections.<br>
