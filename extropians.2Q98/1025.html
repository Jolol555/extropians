One way, as previously mentioned, would be for the displaced to become<br>
servants for the survivors. For centuries, the servant class was an integral<br>
part of society, and they did not suffer degradation in the main in the last<br>
century. The reason the servant class has disappeared in our society is<br>
because of laws requiring tax withholding, worker's comp. and high income<br>
taxes on those who would benefit most from the servants. If the laws were<br>
changed to allow hiring of servants, who would themselves be responsible for<br>
paying the costs of their employment, and income taxes were removed, I<br>
expect many now un- or under-employed would sign on to being servants. Quite<br>
a few 'rich' people would then be able to take on a maid or butler,<br>
gardener, etc. They get essentially free room and board, and have incomes,<br>
and so are a productive part of society. Sounds like a pretty good deal,<br>
when the alternative is living in near poverty on government handouts..<br>
<p>
Another factor is the increase of property taxes. Since these have risen in<br>
the US, there are now no landowners who are actually 'owning' land. They all<br>
pay rent in the form of taxes to the state. This has the effect of<br>
eliminating the 'family home' that was the norm in the last century, where<br>
two or three generations and their servants lived for many decades in one<br>
place. Once you retire, you can no longer pay the taxes, and are kicked out<br>
by the landlord eventually. The taxes on a residence that was 'comfortable'<br>
100 years ago are now something only a Bill Gates can afford..<br>
