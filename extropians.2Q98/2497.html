In one of his biographies, Physisist Richard Feynman claims to have had an<br>
exchange much like this with an older woman after he presented a lecture on<br>
basic physics principles. She told him that she knew how the world was<br>
*really* set up, and when he queried her, she responded with the tortise<br>
premise. When he questioned her further, she scolded him and said that she<br>
knew he was trying to confuse her, but it was "turtles turtles turtles all<br>
the way down".<br>
<p>
Kelly and I use this expression as shorthand to gently point out<br>
unsupportable premises in the statements of others or ourselves.<br>
<p>
However, it is worth pointing out that even in modern physics, we seem to<br>
have infinitely-regressing-turtle-like situations, eg the apparently always<br>
receding "smallest things". First we thought it was gross elements, then<br>
atoms, then subatomic particles (mesons, leptons etc), and now even these<br>
themselves appear to be composed of yet smaller elements  - the quarks. I<br>
for one, would not be suprised to hear scientists speak of even more<br>
fundamental objects/concepts of reality. It certainly seems sometimes as<br>
though the grain of the universe is always just small enough for us to<br>
barely make out, but when our "eyes" get better we see that the grain is<br>
finer still.<br>
<p>
hmmmm.<br>
