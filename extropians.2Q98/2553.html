<i>&gt; &gt;            SCIENCE, TRUTH</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;            RELIGION, MEANING.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually their is a fifth word --- faith.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and most religious persons I know need FAITH because they experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; no meaning in their lives.</i><br>
<p>
	What, like faith that it is impossible to (or that we<br>
shouldn't) overcome evil and all that which ails us?  After all, if<br>
there is a God, we must find some way to justify why God hasn't<br>
overcome evil.  If an all powerful God can't (or shouldn't) overcome<br>
evil, we must abandon all hope that we can (or should) overcome evil<br>
with our science.  If God can't, how can we?<br>
<p>
	Science does give us real faith and hope.  Science says that<br>
with more of the same kind of progress we've seen by mankind in the<br>
past towards overcoming some of what ails us, we will be able to<br>
eventually overcome all of it.  If you have faith in some God, you<br>
must throw all this out since God should have done it before now.<br>
That's the opposite of faith or giving up in despair.<br>
<p>
	If you "believe" in God, you must attempt to justify,<br>
theodicize or accept evil as necessary.  You can't hope to overcome.<br>
Why make so many fruitless attempts to try to twist that which is bad<br>
into some how being good simply to justify some God?  Can't we,<br>
instead, hope to overcome evil rather than trying to find some way to<br>
accept and justify it?  Rather than such giving up in hideous or<br>
faithless despair, I prefer to hope and have faith that it can all be<br>
overcome; that when there really is a near powerful God, he can and<br>
will eliminate evil as we now know it.  Now that is real, honest, and<br>
justified faith to me!<br>
