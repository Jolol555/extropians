   IAN: This point Dan raises is the best case <br>
   for utility first. So is it truth or utility? <br>
   I think it's a false delima resolved by seeing<br>
   that utility-first applies to one set of cases<br>
   and truth-first applies to another set of cases.<br>
<p>
   In the case above, the issue pertains to the <br>
   scarcity of funding, in which case scientific <br>
   research should put utility first, however, <br>
   and this gets to the heart of the matter,<br>
   NEVER can "truth first" not be a prime <br>
   directive of research. So we must have <br>
   two sets here and no contradiction.<br>
<p>
   First, observe that truth-first must always <br>
   be a directive in the research to which a <br>
   utility-first directive also applies since <br>
   any research into improved technologies <br>
   that is based on not truths will be even <br>
   MORE wasteful than research on the stars, <br>
   which could bump into a real gold mine!<br>
<p>
   So I think that "truth first" applies to <br>
   the set of "all inquiry," and "utility<br>
   first" applies to the set of "all expen-<br>
   ditures below ideal levels of resources."<br>
<p>
   By making this observation that truth-first<br>
   applies to X set and utility-first applies <br>
   to Y set, I believe that I have removed the<br>
   basis of confusion as to which ethic is best.<br>
