Who decides who is worthy of invitation?  And more importantly, what makes those who<br>
invite worthy of inviting?  Although I agree the intention of having an invite only<br>
list will increase the overall level of dialogue, it will also have the opposite<br>
effect of shielding out others who might have intelligent ideas to contribute.  The<br>
Polymath list is a perfect case in point.  The level of discussion is intelligent<br>
but also completely inbred.  I don't see much memetic evolution taking place there -<br>
only the same ideas hashed over again, with an occasional new hypothesis to stir<br>
things up.<br>
