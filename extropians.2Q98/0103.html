<i>&gt; From:          "den Otter" &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; From: Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin &lt;warrl@mail.blarg.net&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; A perfect social or political system, in all systems I have examined, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; requires perfect people in some quantity -- dictatorship being the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; best in this regard because it requires the fewest perfect people, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and anarchy among the worst because it requires that the overwhelming </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; majority -- possibly everyone -- be perfect.  In this part of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; world, perfect people are a rather scarce item, and what I read in </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the newspapers doesn't tell me that this is a strictly local </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shortage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Imperfect anarchy is unstable, and seems likely to quickly collapse </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; into tribal warlordism, and then later into dictatorship or </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hereditary monarchy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, exactly! I couldn't agree more. From a purely rational point of view</i><br>
<i>&gt; a "dictatorship" or oligargy based on enlightened principles (as discussed</i><br>
<i>&gt; earlier) would be the most preferable form of government. There is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable possibility to pick the right people to rule a country (there</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been benevolent emperors in the past, I belief for ex. the Romans had</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few),</i><br>
<p>
The first four or five Roman emperors were childless.  They each took <br>
the same approach to choosing a successor, which was:<br>
<p>
 (1) appoint apparently-good people to be provincial governors<br>
 (2) any who proved incompetent, fire and give somebody else a chance<br>
 (3) after a while, bring home the best provincial governor and adopt <br>
him.<br>
<p>
The first Emperor was apparently a good one, along with all who were <br>
chosen by this method.<br>
<p>
Eventually they got an Emperor who had kids.  His eldest son was his <br>
successor and was more than a bit of a jerk.  This set the tradition: <br>
almost every Emperor who inherited the throne from his biological <br>
father was worse than his predecessor; almost every Emperor who did <br>
*not* was *better* than his predecessor; almost every chosen-Emperor <br>
who chosen by a chosen-Emperor was pretty decent.<br>
<p>
The catch is that the dictator, by definition, has the right to <br>
either change the rules of succession,  or choose <br>
anyone he likes; and, if he's at all a decent father, will want to <br>
provide well for his kids.  This means... <br>
