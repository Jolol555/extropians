<p>
I agree with that, but that doesn't mean some technologies just<br>
appears overnight. Just look at the history of the personal computer -<br>
it was a quick evolution by many standards, but it still took several<br>
years and involved a gradual refinement of the technological synergy<br>
that made it possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the technology needed to scan the brain, I think it will be the product of</i><br>
<i>&gt; one incredible idea/device connected to some existing technology. I'm sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you could argue this is graduated science..</i><br>
<p>
You bet :-) My scenario is like this: in 2030, nanotechnology has<br>
helped neuroscientists to understand neurons so well that they can be<br>
simulated with high fidelity, and some research teams have managed to<br>
"scan" the nervous system of trained C Elegans individuals into<br>
computer models by hand. Some bright nanoengineer comes up with a good<br>
disassembly process that can disasseble solid matter, recording its<br>
structure with a high precision. There are already useful pattern<br>
recognition software out there, and one just has to combine the<br>
different processes to get uploading. Everybody in the neuroscanning<br>
business realises it, and tries to make it work. It turns out to be<br>
much trickier than it seems for a variety of reasons (like scaling up<br>
the pattern recognition process to work on nanoscans and linking it to<br>
the creation of a neuromodel, and the unexpected tendency for the<br>
disassembler to gum up in the presence of myelin). But after a few<br>
years, a mouse is uploaded, then a monkey and then a frozen cryonicist<br>
who wrote in his testament that he volunteered for the process. The<br>
first runs of him are less than satisfactory - it was never clear that<br>
the fine-tuning of serotonine receptors had such a subtle effect on<br>
the mental state, something the animal models never could have told<br>
you - but in the end, the upload appears on CNN and is forced to<br>
answer inane questions.<br>
<p>
The whole process, from the time when all the pieces are there to the<br>
upload, may take several years. It is fast, but not instantaneous. A<br>
lot of people will be involved however remotely (neuroscientists,<br>
nanotechnologists, image processing experts, computer scientists,<br>
cryoengineers, virtual reality designers, psychologists, animal<br>
breeders, biochemists, ethical comittees...), even if the original<br>
"wow, we could do an upload!" idea was from a single brilliant<br>
graduate student in Minsk.<br>
