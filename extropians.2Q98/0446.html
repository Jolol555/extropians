I spend a LOT of time on airplanes and have thought about this quite a bit and<br>
have to agree with Hal -- individual parachutes seems a completely unworkable<br>
solution.  Almost every idea I've ever considered to make large commercial<br>
airliners more safe has always ended up making the plane too heavy to fly, or<br>
at least fly profitably.<br>
<p>
Two ideas contiue to intrigue me, though.  One is a detachable passenger<br>
compartment that has SOME sort of deployable aero-drag device or combination<br>
of devices.  The other is an internal fire-retardant foaming system that<br>
activates in anomolous situations (read crashes).  Even if done with the<br>
lightest, cleverest materials and designs, both would add significantly to the<br>
weight and therefore operating cost of the planes and both would also have<br>
safety COSTS, since accidental deployment of either system would tend to ruin<br>
your whole day . . .<br>
