Can you also use this device to solve the Halting Problem? I.e., set up a<br>
system with two possible states, one consistent with a Turing machine<br>
halting and another one consistent with the machine not halting? If so we<br>
can rule out the possibility that this device can be physical by assuming<br>
that the universe has a low algorithmic complexity.<br>

It wouldn't be so paradoxical if the universe is capable of doing infinite<br>
amount of computation in zero time, since you can think of device as being<br>
computed by the universe at the point of time it is received by the<br>
inventor.<br>
