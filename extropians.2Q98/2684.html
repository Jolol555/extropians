In a message dated 98-06-25 17:15:04 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Any God that prevents such actions only ensures that his creations exist in<br>
 the "My Little Pony" universe or something similar.  You insist that you be<br>
 free to tread your own path, yet you castigate a God, who, by letting<br>
everyone<br>
 else do so as well, allows evil into the universe. If he's going to let you<br>
 live as you see fit, then he's going to have to do the same thing with<br>
 everyone else.  Or do you, like the Rev. Robertson, insist that whatever God<br>
 does to "other people" is just fine, and what they deserve?  He wants God is<br>
 going to iwipe out Orlando with a hurricane, you want God to limit my freedom<br>
 of action so that he can fit into your definition of what is acceptable.<br>
 <br>
 Face it, all this talk of not beleiving in a God who allows "horrible<br>
 diseases, accidents and the like."  is so much sophomoric posturing that<br>
 allows you to live in a solipsistic universe where only your actions have<br>
 meaning or impact.  Everything that doesn't fit into your world view or your<br>
 morals is dismissed, allowing you to feel quite superior to a God whom you<br>
 assure yourself doesn't exist anyway. The nice thing about the "light of<br>
 reason" is that if you truly adhere to it, is that you can NEVER assure<br>
 yourself that anything is impossible.  Anytime you do so you've exchange the<br>
 "cold light of reason" for the warm, blissful confines of ignorance. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Noticed your admonishment regarding insulting someone who simply disagreed<br>
with you...Wondered about it in light of this post.<br>
<p>
Anyway.  You seem to have attributed a great many traits to me after having<br>
read that post.  I'm not at all sure of how to disabuse you of them.  I don't<br>
feel "superior to god ". I don't think any such being exists to feel superior<br>
to.  I don't want god to fix everything just for me.  But could you please<br>
explain to me what function AIDS, or tuberculosis, or take your pick,, have in<br>
perpetuating free will?  Why does it have to be all or nothing? You claim that<br>
I seem to want a perfect world.  I never said any such thing. I simply<br>
wondered, in the context of the thread regarding reconciliation of an<br>
omnipotent/ominbenevolent god with the existence of evil.  I equated the<br>
existence of such things as disease with a seeming willingness on the part of<br>
this god to create hardship for no apparent reason.  Is cancer somehow a<br>
neccesary penalty to suffer for the gift of freewill?  I can't believe any<br>
such thing.  <br>
<p>
To simplify:<br>
<p>
1) I don't believe that this god being exists.<br>
<p>
2) If such a being exists, the evidence available to me suggests that<br>
he/she/it is at best uncaring and at worst remarkably cruel.  In either case I<br>
don't care to have anything to do with he/she/it<br>
<p>
3) As you pointed out, one must keep an open mind, but, others on this list<br>
have pointed out that it must not be so open that ones brains fall out.  You<br>
stated that a rational thinker must admit that anything is possible. True as<br>
far as it goes.  This thinker must also attempt to assign some degree of<br>
probability to these possibilities.  Speaking only for myself, I find the<br>
probability of the existence of a omnibenevolent god to be faint to say the<br>
least.  <br>
<p>
I don't want to drag this out forever as can always be the case in any<br>
discussion involving god(s) and religion.  Judging by your post, I feel that I<br>
must have offended you in some way.  This was not my intention.  Rather I was<br>
responding to a particular thread and voicing an opinion.  Nothing more.<br>
<p>
best, Cori<br>
