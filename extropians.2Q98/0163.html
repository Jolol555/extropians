Dear fellow Transhumanists/Extropians,<br>
<p>
In spite of the fact that many of us are involved with information<br>
technology the millenium problem has only received limited attention here.<br>
Since the potential ramifications are... well _huge_ to say the least I<br>
felt it merits some more discussion.<br>
<p>
I know this is 'old news' but many people (companies/governement agencies)<br>
seem to be blisfully unaware of the major hangover that we face after a<br>
long weekend of partying (1-1-2000 is a saturday).<br>
<p>
On this site some basics for those unfamiliar with the problem:<br>
this is a wake-up call: <a href="http://www.garynorth.com">http://www.garynorth.com</a><br>
<p>
It seems pretty fatalistic and I'm not at all sure if it has to be this<br>
bad, on the other hand: most nuclearpowerplants, aiports, utility<br>
companies, armies are not yet year-2000 certified. Fireworks ;-). The same<br>
goes for many logistical systems that supply supermarkets and such. No-one<br>
can tell for sure what the extent of the damage wil be. Maybe your company<br>
has been y2K-certified, but have all it's supliers? And if the bankng<br>
system goes bust how wil anyone buy your product?<br>
<p>
Or, strictly economically speaking (Gary North):<br>
<p>
            What happens to T-bills and T-bonds if the<br>
      IRS computer breaks down and a tax revolt spreads<br>
      because taxpayers know the IRS will never find<br>
      them, and that if they pay their taxes, they<br>
      won't get their refunds?<br>
<p>
            What happens to money market funds and bond<br>
      funds that invest heavily in government debt when<br>
      investors realize that if the IRS can't collect<br>
      taxes, the government will default on its debt?<br>
<p>
            What happens to the banks when depositors<br>
      figure out that the FDIC is bankrupt and that<br>
      nobody insures their accounts any more?<br>
<p>
            What happens to your job when the banks<br>
      close because of bank runs, and no business can<br>
      borrow money or even write a check to its<br>
      employees?<br>
<p>
            What happens to the delivery of food into<br>
      cities when money fails because the banks are<br>
      busted?<br>
<p>
            What happens to the delivery of public<br>
      utilities when money fails because the banks are<br>
      busted?<br>
<p>
            What happens to your retirement fund when<br>
      ERISA, the government pension guarantee program,<br>
      goes bankrupt?<br>
<p>
           What happens to the 38 million people in<br>
      the U.S. who are dependent on Medicare?  <br>
<p>
          What happens to 42 million people on Social<br>
      Security?<br>
<p>
            What happens to every state government?<br>
<p>
            What happens to crime rates when the state<br>
      cannot imprison violent criminals and may have to<br>
      release those who are locked up because they<br>
      can't be fed?<br>
<p>
            What happens to the world economy when this<br>
      scenario is multiplied across every government?<br>
      -------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Let's not discuss how great it would be if the IRS died (we can agree to<br>
disagree or now, I think), but which research institutions could be<br>
damaged. How long can Alcor last without power? How can they rescue<br>
patients if the phones are out? If only a fraction of what Gary North<br>
predicts is true some transhuman goals could very well go down the drain or<br>
quite some time.<br>
<p>
Mr. North also describes the psychology-of-denial that is being practiced<br>
by many managers and governement officials "don't worry, we've got it under<br>
control". The idea that everything could come to a grinding halt is so<br>
fanatastic that it is dismissed "they will find a solution". If you did not<br>
hear about the Y2K-problem untill now you might have the same reaction (I<br>
still have it - a little ;-).<br>
<p>
I have a lot of trust in our ability to rebuild, after all, western Europe<br>
and Japan managed to do so after WWII. But they did get some (in fact,<br>
quite some) help for a big, undamaged country. This time there might not be<br>
big, undamaged countries. How do you repair a mainframe if the power is<br>
out? How do you assemble a team if the phones don't work? How do pay people<br>
if the banking system is in shambles?<br>
<p>
Is anyone planing for what could happen? If so, how? Convert your money to<br>
something with stable value? What? How are you going to enforce your<br>
ownership? Can you distribute these goods? Should you learn new (old) skills?<br>
<p>
I think I'll do some minor stuff like extra shopping, getting a fair amount<br>
of ca$h and securing some alternative heating/lighting. Then again, if<br>
utility's really go down so goes the rest of civilization after a while and<br>
a supply of candles won't help. The Netherlands of course wil be flooded if<br>
our electrical pumps fail for a long time (there are diesel backups but<br>
there might not be any diesel ;-).<br>
<p>
I'm not ready to start looking for another job as Mr Norh advises, maybe<br>
I'll get myself a book on cobol (maybe I'm in denial too ;-).<br>
<p>
Not totally unrelated: What if the general populace does not trust<br>
computers anymore after a big crash? What would the impact be on future<br>
adavancement in AI-research? This could have serious impact on things like<br>
a singularity and technical advances in general (quite difficult to design<br>
or run a spaceship without computers).<br>
<p>
Greetings &amp; sleep well (it's still 631 nights away)<br>
Arjen<br>
