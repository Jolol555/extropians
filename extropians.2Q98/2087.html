<p>
Right, well, you said:<br>
----<br>
I'd put it differently: it acknowledges that any non-trivial system of<br>
thought requires certain founding assumptions. Using these founding<br>
assumptions is not an irrational procedure, unless you wish to declare<br>
all systems of thought irrational.<br>
<p>
In the case of transhumanists, the founding assumptions, or basic values,<br>
are such that life extension is a rational goal. Other systems of thought<br>
do not necessarily imply that. <br>
----<br>
<p>
Obviously I do not wish to declare all axiomatic systems of thought<br>
irrational (though, interestingly enough, this is a central idea in<br>
pan-critical rationalism), however, I instead asserted that a value-ethic<br>
is rational if and only if it is consistent; ie it does not advocate<br>
actions which contradict its stated values. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree with your entire post, excepting part of the first paragraph. The </i><br>
<i>&gt; post is not really related to my original comment, though. Recall that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; comment I made was a caveat, which I do not seriously expect to apply in </i><br>
<i>&gt; many instances. For example, it was not intended to apply to Hayflick. I </i><br>
<i>&gt; was merely pointing out that it is possible to hold a consisitent </i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophy which leads one to conclude that immortality is a bad thing.</i><br>
<p>
And it was my attempt, in showing that choosing to die necessarily<br>
contradicts other values, to show that this is not the case, and one must<br>
be inconsistent in order to conclude that immortality is a bad thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a counter-example to your first paragraph, I offer euthanasia, which I </i><br>
<i>&gt; believe is sometimes justified. This is not a counter-example to your </i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusions, incidentally, but to your assumptions: this is a situation </i><br>
<i>&gt; in which your life may have no use to you in bringing about the things </i><br>
<i>&gt; you value.</i><br>
<p>
I see euthanasia as being not-rational for the one whose suicide is being<br>
assisted, but possibly rational for the one assisting; again, so long as<br>
this does not contradict their value system (which need not incorporate<br>
OTHER living beings in order to remain consistent but must at least<br>
include oneself) then the assistant is acting rationally.<br>
<p>
If immortality is possible, however, it seems difficult to rationally<br>
justify suicide in any form:  So what if you've got an "incurable"<br>
disease?  With cryonic suspension you could have immortality, and your<br>
painful disease will be cured and you will go on to live a long, healthy,<br>
and prosperous life.<br>
