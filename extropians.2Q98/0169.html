"Alcor patient dewars do not rely on electric power for refrigeration. <br>
Instead, low-temperature storage is achieved by continuous submersion of <br>
each patient in liquid nitrogen. Due to the low boiloff, a large patient<br>
dewar <br>
need be replenished only every 8-10 days to maintain an adequate liquid <br>
level. At -196 degrees C, all metabolic and biochemical activity has <br>
effectively ceased. Patients stored at this temperature can be maintained <br>
with very little change for decades, centuries or even millennia if<br>
necessary."<br>

<i>&gt;Mr. North also describes the psychology-of-denial that is being practiced</i><br>
<i>&gt;by many managers and governement officials "don't worry, we've got it under</i><br>
<i>&gt;control". The idea that everything could come to a grinding halt is so</i><br>
<i>&gt;fanatastic that it is dismissed "they will find a solution". If you did not</i><br>
<i>&gt;hear about the Y2K-problem untill now you might have the same reaction (I</i><br>
<i>&gt;still have it - a little ;-).</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  Do you remember when the government shut down for a while, because<br>
the politicians couldn't agree on a budget?  Did you manage to get your<br>
paycheck that month?  Did the economy crash as a result?<br>
<p>
Yeah, well this is even LESS of an issue.  If/when the IRS goes down, the<br>
US government will borrow money to cover the temporary downtime.  And yes,<br>
it will be temporary, because the government will make the IRS its top<br>
priority until it is up and running again, if it goes down at all.<br>
<p>
All of the above horror scenarios are dependent on the government being<br>
unable to collect taxes, which, to be perfectly blunt, won't happen, even<br>
if the IRS WAS shut down for a few weeks.<br>
<p>
Before I hear "Yeah, well, you're in denial," we had best keep in mind that<br>
I would also be "in denial" if you told me the sun wouldn't rise tomorrow.<br>
<p>
To answer a few of your specific questions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How do you repair a mainframe if the power is</i><br>
<i>&gt;out?  How do you assemble a team if the phones don't work? </i><br>
<p>
The utilities will only go out if the banking system is in shambles...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How do you pay people if the banking system is in shambles?</i><br>
<p>
... and the banking system will only find itself in shambles if the<br>
aforementioned "tax revolt" happens and/or FDIC insurance runs out.<br>
<p>
But unfortunately, a tax-revolt will be no easier two years from now than<br>
it would be any other year.  The IRS is not monitoring your transactions<br>
day-to-day; it only does so year to year, and even then only on those whom<br>
it audits.  It keeps little of this data on hand; that data which is on<br>
hand is either saved to disk, (and backed up daily,) or kept on paper.<br>
Moreover, it COLLECTS the data it does have from your bank, employer, etc.,<br>
so imagining that it DID lose all of its data, it could have it all<br>
replaced as necessary.  <br>
<p>
The FDIC would only stop if the government went bankrupt; which won't<br>
happen, because the IRS will not go down permanently.  And fortunately for<br>
the banks, they're closed Jan. 1.  It's a national holiday.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is anyone planing for what could happen? If so, how? Convert your money to</i><br>
<i>&gt;something with stable value? What? How are you going to enforce your</i><br>
<i>&gt;ownership? Can you distribute these goods? Should you learn new (old) skills?</i><br>
<p>
This kind of attitude, however, is the sort that could cause some real<br>
damage.  If everyone, afraid that the US economy is going to crash, pulls<br>
all their money out, they CAN cause it to crash.  But this will not be due<br>
to a technical error, only due to people spreading horror stories like these.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think I'll do some minor stuff like extra shopping, getting a fair amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;of ca$h and securing some alternative heating/lighting. Then again, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;utility's really go down so goes the rest of civilization after a while and</i><br>
<i>&gt;a supply of candles won't help. The Netherlands of course wil be flooded if</i><br>
<i>&gt;our electrical pumps fail for a long time (there are diesel backups but</i><br>
<i>&gt;there might not be any diesel ;-).</i><br>
<p>
Don't bother.  You're frustratingly safe, this time.<br>
