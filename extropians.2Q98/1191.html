Yes. I agree with you what you've said here, but it doesn't address the fundamental<br>
challenge I first proposed.  Beyond the fact that I am playing devil's advocate, I'm<br>
trying to elicit positive constructive scenarios of which otherwise very intelligent<br>
people on this list haven't seen free-markets address.My point is that when you<br>
combine free-markets with automation you get an increase in overall wealth - a good<br>
thing.  However over the last 5-10 years, this increase in wealth has continued to<br>
trickle towards the top.  At last count, 94% of the wealth in the US is in the hands<br>
of the top 20%.  The greatest discrepancy in US history.  So my challenge to<br>
free-market advocates is to demonstrate how free-markets can bring increased<br>
prosperity to *more* people rather than concentrating that new wealth into the hands<br>
of fewer and fewer people.<br>
<p>
I doubt anyone on this list can argue that technology is not accelerating.  Along with<br>
this acceleration we see an increasingly stringent and rapid requirement for<br>
re-training.  The IT industry is a testament to what I'm saying.   The problem in the<br>
IT sector is obvious.  The change is so fast, that the market is finding it<br>
increasingly difficult to find qualified applicants who can do the job.  According to<br>
recent surveys, there are 10 vacancies for every qualified applicant; and for every<br>
100 applicants only 2 are hired.  Those that do get hired have seen their wages<br>
increase more than 20% a year.  A vindication of supply and demand economics.<br>
<p>
To then say that the millions rendered superfluous in the retail sector (thru<br>
e-commerce) will find new ones in the information sector is ludicrous.<br>
<p>
Obviously many won't take starvation lying down, that's why we already have the<br>
economic system you describe in inner cities.  Minority groups, having neither the<br>
skill or access to traditional routes to success, have had to resort to drug dealing<br>
and theft in order to survive. For them is this progress?  If the economy is doing so<br>
well, why is the average wage adjusted for inflation not gone up any significant<br>
amount?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I see no sign that automation has been causing or is likely to cause a</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant number of people to need to work harder to maintain a stable</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard of living. As to how hard people will need to work in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; upload, I don't know.</i><br>
<p>
Why are there more and more 2-parent working families?  Why has the average work week<br>
been increasing?  Why did the average wage in the US  steadily decrease from 1971 to<br>
1996?  Everyone I know says they are working harder than ever before just to make ends<br>
meet.  Why would they be saying that?  I'm not sure I have an answer to that, which<br>
was why I was hoping the more economically adept on this list could provide some<br>
insights.<br>
