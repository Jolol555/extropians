 But isn't it possible that a superior being might not view us as sentient<br>
enough to bother with?  Perhaps we overestimate our importance or<br>
significance in the universe.  If I were driving down the road, I would<br>
certainly swerve to avoid hitting a dog.  How about a turtle....yeah, OK.<br>
How about a worm or an ant...ehhh, don't think so.<br>
<p>
If I was god I would certainly concern myself with the dogs and the turtles<br>
of the universe even if they were a lot less sentient than me, but I would I<br>
feel responsible for the painful experiences of the lower life forms?  In<br>
other words, what if we're at the worm level on the universal sentience<br>
scale relatively speaking?<br>

Might we not  our level of sentience as significant enough<br>
