 in the 1992 presidential election ross perot had a running mate whose<br>
 name escapes me, but he was a man who spoke his mind.  very unpolitical.<br>
 i wished we could toss ross and get him to run for president...  {8^D  spike<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The name of the Admiral escapes me as well.... sad, no?...<br>
At any rate, I didn't mean that I would vote for any person that spoke his/her<br>
mind just on that basis alone.  I mean that it would certainly be refreshing<br>
to have candidates that didn't speak in scripted sound bites.  However I must<br>
say that I do believe we get the sort of candidates we deserve in that we seem<br>
willing to tolerate the bickering and attention to character assassination<br>
that is the mark of the vast majority of campaigns... <br>
I am told repeatedly that "that's the way the world is", but I rather think<br>
that if fewer people accepted that BS answer, then the world wouldn't be that<br>
way... but then, that takes effort and thought.  Something most people seem<br>
loathe to engage in....<br>
