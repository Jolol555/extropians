Okay, I have a 'lukewarm' attitude. Granted.<br>
<p>
Please tell me how having an overbearing, in-your-face attitude, where 'I am<br>
right and you are wrong' (assuming you are a religious type as described) is<br>
going to make you change your mind? More likely, you will come after me with<br>
sword drawn, screaming 'Infidel!'.<br>
<p>
(No, I am NOT calling you a fundie. Unless you are an atheist fundie!)<br>
<p>
The best one can do is to peacefully and by example teach those around him<br>
about tolerance and logical thought. Particularly one's own children!<br>
<p>
Screaming and fist waving are the province of the fundies, and these<br>
critters are NEVER going to change their minds. Why don't we wait for the<br>
present crop to die out, and work to change things here?<br>
<p>
In the US, supporting laws that continue and enhance separation of religion<br>
and government is worthwhile. Writing letters and emails to legislators who<br>
propose religious slanted laws can't hurt! These people will back away from<br>
dumb laws if they see the lack of public support. <br>
<p>
Unless you want a bloody religious war, atheists vs. fundies and all others,<br>
I suggest restraint and attempting to support education and freedom instead<br>
of coercion.<br>
