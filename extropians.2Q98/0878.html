<i>&gt; &gt;Ever time I have seen you try to attack free markets with any sort of</i><br>
logic<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or empirical evidence, that logic and evidence is flawlessy refuted by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;members of this list,(eg. John Clark, Lee Daniel Crocker, Anton</i><br>
Sherwood)<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;who cite a larger body of contradictory evidence and well-thought-out</i><br>
logic<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which supports the benefits of a free market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Every time I have attacked free markets with any sort of logic or</i><br>
empirical<br>
<i>&gt; evidence, I have only gotten opinion and personal experience as a</i><br>
response.<br>
<i>&gt; _Not a single time_, I have received statistics or quoted sources.</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm... maybe my memory is going.  Unfortunately, I have having<br>
difficulties finding out how bad my memory must really be.  I tried<br>
searching the archives, but I was unsuccessful.  Could someone else do this<br>
for me?  Your posts from the first time you were on this list give the best<br>
examples of what I'm talking about (because I think people took you more<br>
seriously back then, and tended to put work into their posts) <br>
Unfortunately, when I tried to search the archives, I kept  getting this<br>
"Erik's Fallacy" thread and nothing else.  Also, I searched for "Rick<br>
Knight" and got nothing... does the search function not go back that far?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You come along, telling everyone that playing or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thinking about playing without red goo is not only in error, but</i><br>
bordering<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on fascism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Retranslated: I come along, tell everyone that being an Extropian or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking about being an Extropian is not only in error, but bordering on</i><br>
<i>&gt; fascism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Where have I done that?</i><br>
<p>
You've said this many times, and since I am having problems searching the<br>
archives, this isn't a very good example, but it'll do for now (sorry, I'll<br>
get more later)<br>
<p>

ideas, especially the free market meme"  Erik Moeller, 1998 <br>
<p>
Maybe you are the one with the poor memory?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;You drop a couple book names (maybe Noam Chomsky is a linguist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and a baseball player?),</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Noam Chomsky has written a very important analysis of the effects of</i><br>
media<br>
<i>&gt; on people. I consider him as one of the most important thinkers of today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and throw out a bunch of red-goo propaganda that has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;been heard by everyone on the list a million times over.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Namely?</i><br>
<p>
Couldn't find anything without getting the archive search to work...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Your points are destroyed by evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Namely?</i><br>
<p>
Ditto.  I'm sure Crocker, Clark, EvMick, et al. can recall simply by the<br>
memory the many times they have successfully rebutted your socialist ideas.<br>
 Unfortunately, my memory is very poor, as you have seen, so I need a<br>
search engine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;You also accuse the creator</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the Extropian No-Goo Baseball List of being a cult leader because he</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;created a list that does not involve talking about red goo, and because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;*some* people on the list have opinions on red goo that contradict</i><br>
yours.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Retranslated:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I accuse the creator of the Extropian maling list of being a cult leader</i><br>
<i>&gt; because he created a list that does not involve criticizing Extropy, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; because some people on the list have opinions on Extropy that contradict</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have retracted from calling the creator of the Extropian mailing list a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cult leader.</i><br>
<p>
And now you call him the "guide" of a cult.  How is that better?  Sounds<br>
like a silly euphenism to me... one created so you don't have to admit you<br>
were wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have not retracted from calling Extropy a cult, one of the reasons for</i><br>
<i>&gt; this was that criticism was not allowed on the Extropy mailing list.</i><br>
<p>
Let's reverse the situation.   You start up a list to discuss socialism. <br>
You explicitly say "this list is meant to discuss socialism, not<br>
anarcho-capitalism.  Capitalist/Socialist debates take up too much of the<br>
lists content, and are not what the list was created for, therefore, I<br>
would ask that if you join this list, take these discussions somewhere<br>
else.  Those who break the rules will be removed from the list."  Now, I<br>
take my anarchist beliefs to your list and start telling everyone on your<br>
list that socialism is flawed and immoral.  You tell me to stop breaking<br>
the list rules since I voluntarily joined the list after I had read the<br>
disclaimer.  I tell you that you are a cult "guide",  that your mailing<br>
list is a cult, and that the members of your cult "believe" in socialism<br>
which I know is bad for humankind.  How do you reply?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; still waiting for a reply by Max on this to find out the current status,</i><br>
but<br>
<i>&gt; right now, it looks good.</i><br>
<p>
So you think it is good that Max is allowing you to break list rules, and<br>
annoy pretty much everyone on this list?  Good for whom?  Aren't you the<br>
one always talking about a "common good" or "what's best for everyone"?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have presented other reasons for calling Extropy a cult, and you say</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt; I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;contorting the meaning of cult</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;until it basically describes every philosophy ever postulated, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;yours.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't you think that Webster's is a valid reference for defining a cult?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't care about what you think  a cult is or should be, I care about</i><br>
what<br>
<i>&gt; it is defined to be, and by this general definition, Extropy is a cult.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Period.</i><br>
<p>
Cults involve belief.  The extropian principles have a version number,<br>
implying that they are not set in stone.  Max also states that someone does<br>
not need to adhere to all the principles to be an extropian.  Where are you<br>
seeing these beliefs that make Extropy a cult?  The only belief I see is<br>
yours: you believe that free markets are inherently bad.  I, on the other<br>
hand, am not sure whether they are bad or good.  What I do know is that<br>
every time I see a debate between a socialist and a capitalist, the<br>
capitalist always comes out on top, and the only way a socialist can<br>
convince himself that he has not lost is by playing with the definitions of<br>
the words he uses until it sounds like he wasn't wrong.  What I also know<br>
is that everything I learn in economics (which comes from empirical<br>
evidence) supports the free-market as a superior system.  This seems to<br>
indicate that free-markets are *probably* better, given the evidence I<br>
have.  Who is the cult member here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe transhumanism is a cult, too, and the red-goo baseball players</i><br>
<i>&gt; are also cultish. Cults are part of culture.</i><br>
<p>
That's a fun little play on words, but you are really destroying the<br>
usefullness of the word "cult."  When "cult" becomes synonymous with<br>
"philosophy", then the usefullness of the word is gone, it is just<br>
redundant.  It seems to me this is what you are doing, since I see Extropy<br>
as nothing more(and nothing less) than a very general and brilliantly<br>
adaptable philosophy, based on the evidence at hand.  Max has said himself<br>
that he cannot guarantee that Extropy will always keep up with the evidence<br>
at hand, but that is what he is attempting to do.  If it cannot, it will be<br>
replaced by something else.  I see you giving no better replacement.<br>
