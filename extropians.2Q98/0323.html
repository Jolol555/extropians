I apologize if I came in on this thread without the necessary awareness<br>
of the *entire contents* of the post I was defending. In no way did I<br>
mean to imply an argument against capitalism, while I AM _definitely_<br>
arguing against overbearing government.<br>
 <br>
CS:&gt;&gt; In addition, inflation by the Federal Reserve has eaten away the<br>
value of our money, drastically.  Just compare prices for a commodity<br>
from, say, the 50s to their present prices, and you will see just how<br>
much  purchasing power the dollar has lost. &lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
<p>
WKT: &lt;&lt;&gt; Holding significant savings primarily in currency-denominated<br>
assets has not been wise for a very long time.  Inflation should have no<br>
effect on the rate of savings; it should merely move those savings<br>
even more toward equity as opposed to currency-denominated assets.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Inflation does indeed have an effect on the rate of savings, for if<br>
the cost of living goes up, less is available for savings because more<br>
money is needed for the day to day business of living.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Inflation will not affect a person's ability to transform equity</i><br>
assets into a self-owned business.  In fact, if the market perfectly<br>
anticipated and allowed for inflation (it's never PERFECT -- merely<br>
better than any real-world-credible alternative we've thought of<br>
yet), inflation would have absolutely no effect on that person's<br>
ability to borrow money to help start the business -- and later repay<br>
the loan. &lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
Depends on how wisely they've invested, doesn't it?  In my opinion,<br>
the stock market is an extremely risky place to be, especially in<br>
today's perilous climate, where massive "bailouts" have become necessary<br>
and many currencies have been or are being seriously devalued.<br>
<p>
Inflation is a true evil for any economy.  It is purely and simply theft<br>
of the purchasing power of whatever particular currency is involved.<br>
