<i>&gt; From: Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin &lt;warrl@mail.blarg.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A perfect social or political system, in all systems I have examined, </i><br>
<i>&gt; requires perfect people in some quantity -- dictatorship being the </i><br>
<i>&gt; best in this regard because it requires the fewest perfect people, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and anarchy among the worst because it requires that the overwhelming </i><br>
<i>&gt; majority -- possibly everyone -- be perfect.  In this part of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; world, perfect people are a rather scarce item, and what I read in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the newspapers doesn't tell me that this is a strictly local </i><br>
<i>&gt; shortage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Imperfect anarchy is unstable, and seems likely to quickly collapse </i><br>
<i>&gt; into tribal warlordism, and then later into dictatorship or </i><br>
<i>&gt; hereditary monarchy.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, exactly! I couldn't agree more. From a purely rational point of view<br>
a "dictatorship" or oligargy based on enlightened principles (as discussed<br>
earlier) would be the most preferable form of government. There is a<br>
reasonable possibility to pick the right people to rule a country (there<br>
have been benevolent emperors in the past, I belief for ex. the Romans had<br>
a few), it's usually the ones who really _don't want the job_. The possibility<br>
that all or at least the majority of "the people" is rational and benevolent<br>
(as needed for good democracy or anarchy) on the other hand is about 0.0...<br>
