Good point. I have this bad habit of attempting to be 'polite'. Must be<br>
early conditioning.<br>
<p>
I believe that if you out of hand eliminate a possibility because of no<br>
PRESENT evidence, you may miss healthy speculation that may uncover the same<br>
evidence you seek. Many great discoveries were made by people saying 'what<br>
if', often in direct opposition to what was well known at the time.<br>
<p>
The particular species of atheist I meant seems to have a mindset similar to<br>
the fundamentalist who will never change his/her beliefs regardless of<br>
evidence to the contrary. When presented with such facts, they invoke God's<br>
(Ungod's?) help to resist temptation..<br>
<p>
I have to agree about those who unconditionally accept what others tell<br>
them, never looking to find out for themselves the basis for these beliefs.<br>
Especially those who 'interpret' writings such as the Bible to support their<br>
own personal agendas. Pick your own examples from the myriad available.<br>
These people have caused more human misery than any other single cause I can<br>
name. <br>
<p>
The fact that the US Government has various referneces to 'God' in our<br>
documents, in a society where religious freedom is supposed to be a basic<br>
right, is hard to understand. It just gives fuel to the individuals<br>
mentioned earlier, and their followers.<br>
<p>
Most religions I have had personal contact with seem to put a premium on<br>
'suspension of disbelief' as a critical part of the ceremony. Perhaps<br>
humanity has an inborn need to disbelieve that we are actually all alone,<br>
and responsible only for our own behavior and the resluts of it?<br>
