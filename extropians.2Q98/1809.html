Subject: Other minds<br>
<p>
A crucial aspect of Ayn Rand's philosophy is her development of an anti-<br>
skeptical position.  The key to this position is her identification of axioms,<br>
or truths that cannot be rejected without committing the fallacy of the<br>
stolen concept.  Rand equates the acceptance of these axioms to the <br>
affirmation that human knowledge is possible.<br>
<p>
But she does not give equal attention to all the skeptical arguments.  Skeptics<br>
classically argued against the validity of the senses, against the existence<br>
of physical objects independent of the mind, against causality; and Rand<br>
presents arguments that all these assumptions are necessary and that they<br>
are aspects of the basic affirmation of existence and consciousness.  But <br>
skeptics also classically argued against the continuity of consciousness and<br>
the reliability of memory, and against the possibility of knowing that<br>
other minds exist--that other people are conscious.  Rand does not offer a<br>
critique of these claims, nor affirm memory and other minds as axiomatic.<br>
<p>
In fact, Rand does not appear to address the question of knowledge of other<br>
minds at all.  This question does appear in Nathaniel Branden's early, <br>
partially philosophically focused writings, however.  Branden argues that<br>
we are directly aware of our own consciousness; that we are aware of<br>
the actions we perform that proceed from the control of our consciousness<br>
over our bodies; and that, seeing other human beings perform similar <br>
actions, we are able to infer that they are controlled by consciousnesses<br>
like ours, though we can never be aware of those consciousnesses.  This<br>
is, in fact, very close to the classic introspectionist paradigm in psychology.<br>
<p>
Epistemologically, this position has significant problems.  Consider, for <br>
example, a parallel position about matter:  that we do not have direct<br>
knowledge of material objects, but, from experience the sensory states<br>
that those objects create by impinging on our sense organs, we infer that<br>
the objects exist.  This representationalist model of perception led<br>
naturally to Berkeley's questions about how this inference could be made,<br>
and to Hume's skepticism about knowledge beyond immediate sensory<br>
awareness.  And in just the same way, the claim that we do not have<br>
direct awareness of other minds, but only infer such knowledge, leads to<br>
a skepticism about the validity of this inference that was at least <br>
latent in Hume and that emerged fully in his logical positivist<br>
successors--and was popularized in some of the fiction of Robert <br>
Heinlein, who was haunted by a nightmare solipsism that gave rise to<br>
stories such as "They" and "All You Zombies."  In contemporary <br>
philosophy, it is commonly accepted that any claim to know what is in<br>
another person's mind, or even to know that that mind exist, is difficult<br>
to support and needs special justification.<br>
<p>
And metaphysically, Branden's assertion that we cannot perceive<br>
another person's consciousness, but can only infer it from its effects,<br>
comes very close to the dualism that Rand claims to reject, and goes<br>
beyond Rand's legitimate claim that consciousness as such as axiomatic.<br>
It is one thing to say that our consciousness is an axiom which no<br>
knowledge of the physical basis of human life and behavior can ever<br>
overthrow.  But it is another thing to say that no physical instrumentation<br>
can ever detect consciousness.  To assert this is to claim that consciousness<br>
is not and cannot be a physical state or process at all--and if this is true,<br>
then it must instead be some kind of nonphysical state or process.  This<br>
is exactly the kind of approach that Peikoff rejects as rationalistic.  And if<br>
we do likewise--if we leave it to scientific investigation to discover whether<br>
consciousness is a specific configuration of physical changes or something<br>
apart from such physical changes--then we are leaving open the chance<br>
that physical instruments will be able to detect and measure consciousness<br>
within a living brain.<br>
<p>
I don't suggest that philosophy can prove by logical arguments that this<br>
can or will happen.  I think it's a question to be settled by observation and<br>
experiment.  In fact, I think observation and experiment have already begun<br>
to settle it--see, for example, Paul Churchland's "The Engine of Reason, the<br>
Seat of the Soul," which shows a sketch of an image taken from the brain of<br>
a monkey looking at a geometric design, in which a distorted but recognizable<br>
variant of that image is spread across the neurons of the monkey's visual <br>
cortex.<br>
<p>
But, beyond questions of scientific fact, I think that philosophy does have<br>
something to say about knowledge of other minds; and I think what it has to<br>
say is quite parallel to what it has to say about knowledge of physical<br>
objects or of cause and effect.<br>
<p>
In the first place, I think it can legitimately be claimed that the existence of<br>
other minds is an axiom.  At a trivial level, if X tells Y that X does not<br>
believe<br>
in the existence of other minds, Y is entitled to ask, "Who do you think you<br>
are trying to convince?"  By the mere fact of engaging in philosophical<br>
discussion, we are presupposing that the other participants in the discussion<br>
are conscious.  But, more generally, the existence of other minds is at the<br>
base of our knowledge, and to deny it would be to deny the possibility of<br>
knowledge.<br>
<p>
For one thing, conceptual knowledge is embodied in propositions that are<br>
expressed in language.  But language is learned from other people; even if<br>
there are valid cases of children who invented their own languages when<br>
cut off from other human beings, such cases involve at least two children<br>
using language interpersonally.  Solitary children do not learn to use a<br>
language.  But if we are to learn to use language to refer to the physical<br>
world, it appears that we must presuppose that the people from whom we<br>
learn it are also using it to refer to the physical world, and thus that they<br>
too are conscious.<br>
<p>
More generally, consider the enormous extent of human knowledge, and<br>
how much human knowledge is needed even to think of philosophical<br>
questions such as whether other people are conscious.  No one person could <br>
possibly invent all that knowledge alone, or hold it in their awareness.<br>
People may perceive and reason alone, but without a massive cognitive<br>
division of labor, they would do so in an unimaginably narrow scope. We<br>
have to accept that other people have knowledge of reality--and thus that<br>
they are able to identify reality--and thus that they are conscious.  If we<br>
don't, we have no warrant to accept any beliefs that rest on what we<br>
have read, or heard in conversation.  In short, the existence of other minds<br>
is an axiom, in the strongest sense:  to deny that other people are conscious<br>
is to deny the basis of so much of our own knowledge that even the denial<br>
itself could not be claimed to be a valid belief.  Or, to paraphrase John<br>
Galt, let the psychotic who denies that other people are conscious prove<br>
it without drawing on anything they were taught by other people.<br>
<p>
But, in the second place, Rand also states that axioms are known by direct<br>
perception.  We don't deduce that existence exists; we see it before us.  We<br>
don't deduce that we are conscious; we experience consciousness.  Axioms<br>
are first known by perception, and only later consciously identified and<br>
underscored as the basis of knowledge; and that underscoring is not a proof<br>
of the axioms--since any attempt to prove anything already presupposes<br>
that they are true--but a recognition that we are presupposing them and<br>
a reaffirmation of our intent to go on doing so.<br>
<p>
It's easy to grasp that the validity of the senses can be known implicitly in<br>
this way; all knowledge starts out through sensory perception, and thus<br>
the fact that we are relying on our senses is implicit in all awareness of<br>
anything.  But how can we know that other people are conscious in this<br>
way?  How can we perceive consciousness in other people?<br>
<p>
A scientific approach to this question can be found in a book that I believe<br>
has been referred to in this mailing list previously:  Simon Baron-Cohen's<br>
"Mindblindness."  Baron-Cohen proposes that there are automatic neural<br>
mechanisms through which human beings perceive other beings, and<br>
particularly other human beings, as conscious, and that the basis for<br>
autism is the impaired functioning of some of these mechanisms.  Baron-<br>
Cohen describes four such processes:  intentionality detection, which<br>
identifies self-propelled motion; eye-direction detection, which<br>
identifies the focal point of another's attention; shared attention, which<br>
turns one's own attention to such a focal point, as when a baby looks in<br>
the direction of its mother's gaze; and theory-of-mind, which infers<br>
internal mental states.<br>
<p>
Whether Baron-Cohen's account of the causes of autism is correct is<br>
a complex issue needing further research.  But the idea that such automatic<br>
mechanisms operate within perception makes it comprehensible that<br>
we could perceive each other's consciousness, rather than inferring it<br>
through abstract thought.  Remember that a perception is a group of<br>
sensations that are automatically retained and integrated into a<br>
whole.  The fact that there is no sensory receptor for the neural activity<br>
within another brain, or for the mental activity within another mind (if the<br>
two are distinct), no more means that we cannot perceive consciousness<br>
than the fact that there is no sensory receptor for three-dimensional<br>
shape means that our brains cannot integrate sensations of light, <br>
contact, pressure, and muscular effort into a perception of shape, or that<br>
such a perception is merely a theoretical inference, or that it is<br>
open to skeptical doubts.  In fact, perception of three-dimensional<br>
shape is the starting point for our knowledge of the physical world; and<br>
perception of other people as consciousness is the starting point for<br>
our knowledge of psychology, or at least a starting point for it.<br>
<p>
And once we are freed of the idea of consciousness as a mysterious hidden<br>
force, state, or process that lurks within the brain, we can see that<br>
consciousness is readily apparent to observation.  Is the cat asleep or<br>
awake?  I say his name, softly, and watch his ears; if they turn toward<br>
the sound of my voice, he is awake and has heard.  When I see this, I see<br>
a shift in his attention--and thus I see his consciousness.  On the usual<br>
dualist or behaviorist accounts, going from the motion of the ears to<br>
the functioning of consciousness to produce that motion requires <br>
sophisticated scientific and philosophical theorizing, to such a degree <br>
that only a brilliant mind could achieve it; but, in fact, most species of<br>
animals that are preyed upon have some ability to perceive that a <br>
predator is looking at them.  Consciousness is known perceptually long<br>
before it is identified conceptually.<br>
<p>
Of course, we can be mistaken in seeing someone as conscious, just as<br>
we can be mistaken in seeing two lines as having the same length.  We<br>
can certainly misperceive what specifically another person is paying<br>
attention to, or what they are thinking about it.  But this no more invalidates<br>
our basic awareness that they are conscious than misperception of physical<br>
objects gives us any ground for doubt that physical objects exist.<br>
<p>
In short, other minds can be known to exist in the same way that physical<br>
objects can be known to exist, by perception; and such perception is at the<br>
base of our knowledge long before we gain enough knowledge to identify<br>
it consciously as having the status of an axiom, which it has.  And to argue<br>
for knowledge of other minds as an inference from our own introspection<br>
and from perception of other people's bodies is to grant too much validity<br>
to skeptical doubts on the subject--just as to treat physical objects as having<br>
existence inferred theoretically from our own sensations is to grant too<br>
much validity to that sort of skepticism.<br>
