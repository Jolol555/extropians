I wouldbeleive it if an owner was thousands of miles away and threw <br>
something, and the dog automatically started to fetch at that very <br>
moment, every time.  No, I know that a study I did read about showed <br>
that most of this dog 'psychic' behavior was them hearing the sound of <br>
their owners vehicles at a far greater distance than previously thought <br>
capable. A similar study with african elephants, which seemed to <br>
mysteriously communicate at far greater distances than their ears were <br>
capable of hearing ultimately found that elephants have a heretofore <br>
unknown range of communication in the extreme low frequency range of <br>
sound, which they sense through their feet. ELF sound travels around <br>
obstacles far easier than sound in normal hearing ranges. This hearing <br>
range, known as the infrasonic range, is also the reason why elephants <br>
can find areas where water is flowing near the surface of the ground, <br>
and can sense thunderstorms at very far ranges.<br>
