No it does not, although Maxwell tried very hard to make it do so. Maxwell's <br>
greatest triumph came when he proved that a changing electrical field creates <br>
a changing magnetic field and a changing magnetic field creates a changing <br>
electrical field. He then proved that this phenomena propagated as a wave at <br>
a speed of  1/(EM)^1/2 , where E and M are the well known electric and <br>
magnetic constants, this give a speed of 3*10^8 M/sec and this was exactly <br>
the speed for light that was experimentally and independently found. <br>
The match was too close, it couldn't be a coincidence, light must be an <br>
electromagnetic wave. <br>
<p>
There was one nagging little problem however, the electric and magnetic <br>
constants are the same for everybody, that's why they're called constants, <br>
and that means that the speed of light would be the same for every observer. <br>
Maxwell thought this was a (minor) flaw in his theory, he assumed that his <br>
derivation of the speed of light was only for an observer that was at <br>
absolute rest, but this assumption was definitely not in the equation, <br>
it said not one thing about the motion of an observer. Maxwell tried to <br>
modify his theory to make his assumption explicit but he failed, 40 years <br>
later Einstein explained why he failed and why a modification was not needed.<br>
