<i>        &gt;Yes, the system relies heavily on the competence and benevolence of        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the leader </i><br>
                  <br>
And is precisely the fatal weakness of your system.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;but of course he'll be elliminated by someone if he does too        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;outrageous things, so that's a safety. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, our leader will be eliminated unless he ignores trivial things like  <br>
benevolence, justice and transhuman principles and concentrates all his <br>
energies on just one thing. A dictator's full time job is to remain dictator, <br>
nothing else. If he doesn't want to work at it full time I guarantee you <br>
somebody else will want to and get his job as a result.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You want someone who does his duty but doesn't enjoy it _too_ much. </i><br>
                  <br>
Such people never become dictators and if they did they would not last.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The system is more or less a constitutional monarchy, but not a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;hereditary one. </i><br>
                  <br>
The first thing the dictator would change.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if it fails...well, you can always try anarcho-capitalism.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
It will fail and then you're stuck with it because Big Brother has <br>
surveillance over his subjects so complete Stalin would have drooled, he also <br>
has a very sophisticated torture network that would terrify everyone and he <br>
has the power to throw out any verdict of the courts that are "obviously" <br>
wrong. Good luck trying to get rid if that monstrosity.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;minimum wage is the difference between 10 reasonably paid workers or         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;30 badly underpaid workers.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
OK, but why is that economically smart or moral? Now you have 20 workers who <br>
are not paid little, they are paid ZERO.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;a smart ruler won't go against the people's wishes *too* often.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A smart ruler will shoot the people who go against his wishes. The trouble <br>
with all this is that you're assuming the ruler has values very similar to <br>
your own. Unlikely.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The adequacy test is meant for government employees (especially in        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;important functions) </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree, there would be an adequacy test, the ability to stay in power. <br>
Do that and you pass the test, end of story.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In reality, no state on earth has enough power to just do anything         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;with its people, and the politicians know it. As long as you need         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;them for maintaining the system you can't just kill them. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Cambodian politicians murdered close to 30% of the nations population. <br>
Percentage wise I think that's the best that's been accomplished this century, <br>
but they didn't have anything as powerful as the hellish machines your brave  <br>
new world would have, with a little work I'm sure a new record could be set.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;anarchy inevitably leads to structure, </i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and structure leads to centralism.         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No. Where is the center of the Internet? Where is the center ofbiological         <br>
life, where is it controlled from?           <br>
    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Wherever there's an organized structure of some kind and capitalism,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;there will be bribes.</i><br>
                   <br>
Bribes are much rarer in capitalism than in politics.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Civil remedies still depend on a government to enforce them. </i><br>
                   <br>
They do now, but you see no way that could ever change. I do.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I can imagine all sorts of mafia types having a ball, no longer        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;hampered by even token government intervention. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The Mafia exists because they provide a service that people want that can not <br>
be obtained any other way, like drugs, prostitution, gambling, money <br>
laundering and high interest loans. Without government help by making these <br>
victimless crimes illegal the Mafia would be dead. <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I would expect a greater number of "brown shirts" (bullies that are         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;only tough enough to terrorize unarmed or badly armed people) in the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;PPA business</i><br>
                   <br>
You would prefer bullies so tough they terrorize well armed people?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;while the army is more about patriotism         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The last refuge of the scoundrel and one of the major wellsprings of human <br>
misery.<br>
