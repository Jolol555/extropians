I *did* e-mail him and expressed my strong disappointment with his shoddy<br>
reporting and with the flippant and sarcastic tone he used throughout the<br>
article.  Inaccurate and misleading articles like this are a disservice to<br>
the reading public, and I wanted him to know it.<br>
<p>
As for the survey, I was actually pleasantly surprised to see that almost<br>
half of those responding indicated that they *would* be willing to be<br>
cryonically preserved if the funds were available, and that about half would<br>
place their trust in the cryonics firm to revive them.  That's a *much*<br>
larger percentage than I think most hard-core cryonicists would have<br>
expected.<br>
<p>
I am hoping to design and conduct a more comprehensive survey in the late<br>
summer, perhaps, assessing the publics familiarity with and their attitudes<br>
towards cryonics.  I hope to identify the most common misconceptions and the<br>
relative strength of various persuaders / dissuaders.  More when I am<br>
further along.<br>
<p>
I love this list!<br>
