I found out I was a transhumanist even before I had even heard of Max <br>
More. (I think it was the site of Anders Sandberg where I first <br>
encountered the term transhumanist.) Of course I had to come to the <br>
Extropy website en get a member of this list first to recognize that <br>
I have a quite extropian philosophy of life myself. <br>
<p>
IMO most people who now call themselves transhumanist or extropian <br>
already were so before they even knew these terms. <br>
<p>
The most important thing that Max More did was creating the Extropy <br>
Institute and thereby bringing people with the same transhumanist/<br>
extropian philosophy of life together. Not because they want to <br>
follow Max More, but because they want to communicate with other <br>
persons supporting the same philosophy of life. <br>
