Call me evil, but I just love to see someone get backed into a corner when their<br>
DOGMA is challenged.  I personally love the free-market.  I consistently back<br>
free-market proposals over government-centered ones.  Thats why I am asking other<br>
free-marketeers if they can conceptualize a market-mechanism which would<br>
alleviate the poorer segment of humanity without resorting to some kind of<br>
regulatory socialist system.  So far only Dan Fabulish has been able to do so<br>
with any degree of logic and demonstration.<br>

<p>
Is your *particular* free-market philosophy so weak that it cannot withstand<br>
debate?  And you call yourself an extropian?  If you can't deal with healthy<br>
debate within your own community (I am an extropian and have been so for at least<br>
8 years) how to you expect to deal with it in the rest of the world?<br>
