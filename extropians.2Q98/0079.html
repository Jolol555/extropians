At 04:54 AM 4/4/98 +1000, you wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;If their human capital is worth almost nothing to the market (as it is, or</i><br>

<i>&gt;PPA.</i><br>
<p>
A PPA, even a tyrannical one, supported by people who are worth nothing to<br>
their PPA, would not be in business for long.  I conclude that they are<br>
worth something, and to the extent that they are, another PPA would be<br>
willing to support them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;not really, it just means that his growth wouldn't grow, but it does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;mean that his growth would decline.  He could just keep a stable state and</i><br>
<i>&gt;spend all his profits on his whims.</i><br>
<p>
It would decline relative to those around him, who would continue to grow<br>
at a far faster rate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, again we are trusting the powerful to be wise, just like in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;dictatorship, monarchy, democracy, or any other form of centralised</i><br>
<i>&gt;government.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not trusting anybody.  I continue to assert that Bill Gates would be<br>
crushed if he tried to pursue the policy of enslavement.  The fact that he<br>
knows this is only an additional safeguard.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the indians will not be hiring anyone cos they will be dead.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I'd missed this.  I'd thought he was trying to enslave the Indians,<br>
but you had meant he was trying kill them.  My mistake...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And as i</i><br>
<i>&gt;showed before, Gates could do this with just using his profits.  (And if</i><br>
<i>&gt;you don't like the numbers, change the 10000000 indians for 1 million</i><br>
<i>&gt;indians, the actual number is inconsequential to the argument as long as</i><br>
<i>&gt;that number reaches Shocking Proportions (tm))</i><br>
<p>
... but in that case, perhaps you'd best consider that right now he could<br>
just as easily purchase some attack helicopters from a defense contractor<br>
(he could afford it), renounce citizenship in the United States, and then<br>
bribe the current Indian government into not stopping him as he razes their<br>
cities.<br>
<p>
As Clark pointed out, if Bill Gates suddenly decided to stop at nothing to<br>
kill you or me or 10 million people out in India, we'd ALL be in serious<br>
trouble, especially under our current political system.  Anarcho-capitalism<br>
won't be able to put a stop to this sort of thing; it is not utopian.<br>
However, at least under anarcho-capitalism the Indians could legitimately<br>
employ someone else before Bill Gates decided to launch his assault.  They<br>
would not have to support their corrupt government while they were under<br>
attack.  As I see it, they would have a chance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I addressed this in my previous answer to your mail. The profit to your</i><br>
<i>&gt;current PPA is greater than the potential profit to the other PPA, etc...</i><br>
<p>
Which I also explicitly disproved.  People would pay at least as much if<br>
not more for freedom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't see this at all.  War is expensive for both sides.  Your PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't have to fight anyone if no other PPA tries to "rescue you".  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;no other PPA will try because they know that your PPA gets a higher profit</i><br>
<i>&gt;from you than they would (since that is the point of your rescue,</i><br>
<p>
This, I repeat, is simply untrue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;otherwise they would try, and probably succeed, but this means that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;would get more out of you than your current PPA).  Analogies with</i><br>
<i>&gt;nation-states ad infinitum.</i><br>
<p>
Though the conclusion to this point is telling.  They WOULD probably<br>
succeed, because they WOULD get more out of you than your current PPA.<br>
That's our whole point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Depends what you mean on "this whole land".  If you mean the US, i would</i><br>
<i>&gt;say they get a very nice forced profit from you, and almost complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;autonomy from any civil law.  this is probably more profitable for them</i><br>
<i>&gt;than forcing a military dictatorship (they are tricky things to run, very</i><br>
<i>&gt;personnel-intensive, and probably not worth the trouble).</i><br>
<p>
The military gets paid well, but not half as well as they could be.  Not to<br>
mention the fact that, at least for now, they only receive the wages which<br>
the politicians allow them to receive.  There's no question, the military<br>
would DEFINITELY profit by rejecting this policy and taking over the country.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Depends on your idea of freedom.  I don't see it as something only</i><br>
<i>&gt;quantitavely rather than qualitatively different from the current state.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not certain what you mean by this, but I can assure you that freedom is<br>
not binary.  Someone at the point of a gun is more free than someone<br>
physically strapped to the ground, but clearly less free than someone who<br>
isn't being threatened at all.  I see these as quantitative, not<br>
qualitative changes.<br>
