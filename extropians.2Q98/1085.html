I read a study where dolphins were in a tank with a sonar-transparent<br>
partition.  Pushing on a lever in one half would release fish into<br>
both halves.<br>
<p>
A dolphin was trained in the half with the lever to understand how<br>
it worked.  He could see fish being released into both halves.  Then he<br>
was put into the other half and a new dolphin brought into the first half.<br>
<p>
If they could communicate abstract concepts, the first dolphin could tell<br>
the second dolphin to push the lever, and then they'd both get fish.<br>
<p>
However, the second dolphin didn't learn to push the lever any faster than<br>
the first dolphin did.  So apparently no such communication occured.<br>
<p>
I believe other studies were done along these lines, and there has never<br>
been any evidence of abstract communication among cetaceans.<br>
