But in a vacuum no one can hear you scream ;)<br>

Actually, you can guide a lot with linear motors, without turning the<br>
subterrestrial astronauts into gelee. But the scheme has several<br>
flaws, in fact. Correction of flight trajectory and maintaining the<br>
vacuum (hitting a wall of air at these velocities is a good method to<br>
fashion abovementioned gelee, which then gets lyophilized in situ, as<br>
the turbovacs kick in -- yummy) requires active tunnel segments. Which <br>
will need juice, and cost a bit. Of course with drextech you can do<br>
anything, but simply sending information encoding the object <br>
(or farcast your telepresence avatar via fibre or LEO routed <br>
geodetic links) is way cheaper.<br>
<p>
Besides, but for athmosphere exit and reentry, the travel difference<br>
between subterrestrial and LEO travel should be not that much to<br>
require the hideously high costs of a subtersat. Also, the view out of <br>
the window is prettier.<br>

On an unrelated tentacle, here is a monkey catapult idea. You probably<br>
know that liquid CPR has arrived as an advanced ER technique. Well, if <br>
floating in a container of saline with lungs full of oxygenated<br>
fluorocarbon you can as well put you into a Luna-located<br>
PV/capacitor-driven linear motor a few km long, while keeping the g's<br>
well below monkey homogenization threshold.<br>
<p>
Take a superconducting coil, and make sure it won't quench due to<br>
launch forces, and mount it upon a composite (you'd have to shield the <br>
human, though) containment with a (anaesthesized or VR-entertained) <br>
monkey pickled in saline/fluorocarbon, add a fuel cell and some <br>
controlling circuit and hurl the whole thing from the lunar linear<br>
motor catapult. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.<br>
<p>
Of course you must make sure an inverse thing catches you on the other <br>
end, orelse this is just an expensive means of having you making a<br>
GIANT impact upon poor unsuspecting target, and you probably won't<br>
like the saline that much (you can remove the lung flooding while <br>
in transit), though one can think about protective membranes, and <br>
additives to saline. One will want to minimize the mass, though, which <br>
limits the comfort, and flight duration. (Of course you can think<br>
nanorecycling/pocket microecology and nuclear power if the PV array<br>
unfolded in transit doesn't suffice in the outskirts of the Solar<br>
system, etc, but then it is slowly turning ridiculous).<br>
<p>
And of course it will be nothing like StarTrek, and this is why people <br>
will hate it.<br>
