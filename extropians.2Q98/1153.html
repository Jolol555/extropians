Religion is such an inherent part of humanity is it amazing so many so<br>
called 'intellectuals' disregard it.<br>
<p>
I honestly pity anyone who has not read or seen James Campbell.<br>
<p>
In any event, the 'Christian' religion seems most stated.<br>
<p>
May I remind all readers there *WAS NO MOSAIC TRADITION* prior to the<br>
'captivity', which was an historic event of around 586 BCE.  After<br>
this time the powers that be (Babylonian emperors) let the captives go<br>
back to their respective homelands.  Judah (the 'Israelites') were of<br>
such non-importance *NO* mention of them is made in *ANY* text of the<br>
period.  Several hundred thousand Jews is *NOTHING* compared to the<br>
millions of Egyptians or the Assyrians or the Hittites or whatever.  <br>
<p>
The most amazing thing is that this insignificant race has managed to<br>
promote itself into a world power.<br>
<p>
Moses is a derivative of Ramses a derivative of Ra Moses...meaning<br>
(methinks) Son of the Sun, born of water.<br>
<p>
All of which is a derivative of the ancient (many thousands of<br>
year)pre-Jewish history of the Babylonian mythologies.<br>
<p>
There was Gilgamesh, looking for immortality, surviving the flood. <br>
(I'll remember the Babylonian 'Noah' any day, I just can't at the<br>
moment.)<br>
There was Sargon, obtaining the Code of Law from 'god'.<br>
<p>
There are dozens of other examples.<br>
<p>
The entire Jewish/Christian mythos was stolen directly from Babylon,<br>
who's mythos may have been stolen from even ancient traditions.  The<br>
'flood' has been possibly related to the flooding of the Black Sea<br>
during the warming period after the Great Glacial Period.<br>
<p>
Extropians should recognize and teach these phenomenon based on fact. <br>
Whether you believe in religion or not, religion WILL BE a factor in<br>
human psyche for many generations.  It is up to those able to<br>
interpret the symbology to instruct those who cannot.<br>
<p>
This will be doubly important to those who may opt to 'upload' and not<br>
able to understand.  There will be a whole new 'religion' when (and<br>
if) this happens.  'Do yo believe in human?' will be a prominent<br>
question.<br>
<p>
Do not underestimate the power of history, humanism, or what has<br>
always been accepted.<br>
