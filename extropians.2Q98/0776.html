<i>&gt; &gt; It is for this reason that I call myself "atheist" even though</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Tom's more logical definition might not apply.  I want there to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be no doubt in anyone's mind that even though I may rationally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; refuse to assert that there is positively no God, I nonetheless</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; want to make it clear that I think those who assert that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is a God have lost my respect, and decisions of any kind made</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from theist doctrine are bad decisions, not merely different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In general I like what you say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But just one question? "lost my respect" When is that ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; at what age. I mean, a lot of us are raised in families</i><br>
<i>&gt; where religion is part of their daily lives. It took me quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; some years to get rid of this an find out that there was</i><br>
<i>&gt; more to life then the principles I was raised with.</i><br>
<i>&gt; So, because of this, I do respect people with an other</i><br>
<i>&gt; view on life. But I want it back too. My boss is a "fanatic </i><br>
<i>&gt; believer" We disagree basically on everything. But we shared</i><br>
<i>&gt; our visions and just let it be..... He doesn't want to change</i><br>
<i>&gt; me and I don't "want" to change him. But I keep letting</i><br>
<i>&gt; him know, that I think he has it all wrong :-)</i><br>
<p>
I certainly don't expect children to know better, but at<br>
whatever point a person becomes responsible for eir own<br>
beliefs, and has free choice, my opinion of em will depend<br>
on those choices.  If ey chooses to believe in God, I will<br>
certainly still show em the benevolence due all sentient<br>
beings, and be happy to trade with em (though I may be more<br>
reluctant to extend credit to someone who believes the<br>
world is ending soon:).  But "respect" is something given<br>
freely, not "due" anyone, and I would not choose to give<br>
it here.<br>
<p>
My own values respect honesty greatly--and science, which<br>
is just methodical honesty--and so I cannot respect one<br>
who willfully chooses to value speculation over evidence.<br>
Such a person is not to be trusted in other matters where<br>
honesty is important.<br>
