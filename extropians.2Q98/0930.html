<i>&gt; Several recent interesting posts sent me scrambling through a dusty old</i><br>
<i>&gt; pile of my magazine tear-sheets, whence I dug out an article I published in</i><br>
<i>&gt; an Australian mass market magazine in October 1967 - is it possible to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; so ancient? surely not - entitled whimsically `If there is no God, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; pulls up the next Kleenex?'  Diverting to see what curious intimations of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism were afloat in those dim lost days...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ==================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...biblical religion... simply is not hooked into the dynamo of our age.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is too firmly entrenched in patterns of thought and emotional response</i><br>
<i>&gt; long superannuated; it has a weight of centuries on it.  Stripped to</i><br>
<i>&gt; fighting weight, it comes out punchy, its jab is short and feeble and</i><br>
<i>&gt; directed at shadows painted on its own eyes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet there remains that brooding violence in our culture's belly, the large</i><br>
<i>&gt; reality which magic and religion, before our day,  handled not</i><br>
<i>&gt; unsuccessfully.  Perhaps, with Julian Huxley, we can call it *the divine*,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the latent potency which is not supernatural but *transnatural*.  It is, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggest, the same coiled spring which drove primitive man, in a fury of</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention, to build gods as its representation.  It is the subterranean</i><br>
<i>&gt; torrent of dread and exultation which is the twin realisation of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; blurred insignificance before the towering presence of the universe and our</i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitable personal extinction, and the full, rich, scarcely-glimpsed</i><br>
<i>&gt; flowering of human possibilities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here, perhaps, is the central existential reality we must neither</i><br>
<i>&gt; propitiate nor ignore, but embrace.  It finds a statement in Huxley's</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific panorama: "This new vision is both comprehensive and unitary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It integrates the fantastic diversity of the world into a single framework,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pattern of all-embracing evlutionary process." [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There seems, as I mentioned at the beginning, to be something ludicrous in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the assertion that our having relinquished religion might be the betrayal</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our civilisation to vast undirected energies.  Yet it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; implausible.  In casting off a belief in God "which has ceased to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientifically tenable, has lost its explanatory value, and is becoming an</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual and moral burden to our thought", we have carelessly lost</i><br>
<i>&gt; sight of the divine which ante-dated gods.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Norman Mailer has spoken of the plight of our time, that our world "reduces</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's sense of reality by reducing to the leaden formulations of jargon</i><br>
<i>&gt; such emotions as awe, dread, beauty, pity, terror, calm, horror and</i><br>
<i>&gt; harmony", that it "leaves us further isolated in the empty landscapes of</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychosis, precisely that inner landscape of void and dread which we flee".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And yet it may not have to be that way.  "Maybe we are in a sense the seed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the seed-carriers, the voyagers, the explorers...; maybe we are engaged in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a heroic activity, and not a mean one".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; =======================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; More than three decades later I would distance myself from the last wisps</i><br>
<i>&gt; of teleology and crypto-religiosity in that piece.  Still, perhaps it</i><br>
<i>&gt; catches a moment (perhaps shared by FM-2030 in another part of the world at</i><br>
<i>&gt; around the same time) when we started to see the plausibility - indeed, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitability - of a transhumanist trajectory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Incidentally, some of that old article was later recycled in my 1982 sf</i><br>
<i>&gt; novel *The Judas Mandala*, with its explicitly transhuman cyborgs, virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt; realiy, and Tiplerian Omega-mind.)</i><br>
