<i>&gt; &gt; What is the flaw in changing the name Anarcho-Capitalism to Agoric</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Democracy?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       It would be a _lie_.  Good definitions read 'from right to left.'</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The flaw is that Capitalism is neither anarchic nor agoric, and -- as Noam</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chomsky among many others has pointed out -- Anarcho-Capitalism would in</i><br>
<i>&gt; practice very likely produce the most hideous tyranny the world has ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen.  You do not have to meet many Anarcho-Capitalists to realize this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; These are people whose minds have been seized by an axiomatized deductive</i><br>
<i>&gt; system.  Every question becomes ansered by a look-up table, or mantra-like</i><br>
<i>&gt; incantations of 'the market will sort it out.'</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Even 'saints' would wind up as tyrants under anarcho-capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
But is that such a bad thing? Having a benevolent tyrant to rule the moronic masses<br>
would likely be far less problematic than letting the slobs rule themselves...since<br>
most of those masses don't want the responsibility anyways...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Individual freedom is an optimum, not an absolute.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, you get out of it what you put into it. If you are a lazy slob, you wind up<br>
slaving away for someone else...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       There is no 'Absolute Foundation' for property rights, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;       propose to base an entire society on the illusion that there is, is</i><br>
<i>&gt;       the sort of crass folly only clever people are capable of.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    [ FX: "SHOUT MODE OFF" ]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Even _one_ working example would be nice...</i><br>
<p>
An Absolute Foundation? Of what kind? And based on what Doctrine of the sourch of<br>
such Rights, Natural Law or the Force Doctrine??<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Capitalism. (n).  Hierarchical economic system structured to give further</i><br>
<i>&gt; cascading privileges to the existing owners and controllers of Capital.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Usually turns into 'crony-Capitalism' (ref: Hernando de Soto, 'El Otro Sendero').</i><br>
<p>
Y'know, most trust fund babies that I have met have been the most spendthrift, lazy,<br>
unmotivated, unsuccessfull slobs I have ever known. I really don't fear such morons,<br>
and it helps that they have so much money to blow, as its then much easier for active<br>
anarcho capitalists like myself to score a big profit on a few deals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Supposed benefits include fabled 'trickle-down' of economic resources,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is no doubt why 350 000 children die _every day_ from preventable</i><br>
<i>&gt; disease and malnutrition.  Imagine yourself reading gung-ho capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; tracts to them as they die hideously in front of your eyes...</i><br>
<p>
Yet, I am not aware of any children here in the US or other highly<br>
capitalist/mercantilist economies that die from malnutrition, other than those who<br>
are suffering from such psychological ailments as anorexia. Ethiopia, OTOH, that<br>
socialist paradise, has lost more people to malnutrition in 15 years than are<br>
currently alive there today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Agorism. (n). Horizontalist, 'reticular' or networked system of</i><br>
<i>&gt; interacting _equals_.  Note that Agorism is a fully-fledged _social_</i><br>
<i>&gt; system while Capitalism is an _economic_ system.</i><br>
<p>
Yet Agorism takes its name from the ancient term for 'the market'. Do agorists<br>
emphasize the minor social aspects of a community bazaar, while blithely ignoring the<br>
over-riding economic aspects?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anarcho-Capitalism: (n). Imaginary system of society where powers of</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolute government (secret police;  mass murder -- i.e. nuclear weaopons;</i><br>
<i>&gt; torture chambers -- i.e. maximum security prisons; judicial murder -- i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'the death penalty', etc. etc.) are all up for sale to the highest</i><br>
<i>&gt; bidders. Any half-way intelligent devious 'Capitalist' (I know several)</i><br>
<i>&gt; will show you how to turn all this into an absolute dictatorship while</i><br>
<i>&gt; still retaining the 'anarcho-capitalist' labels and trimmings.  Take a</i><br>
<i>&gt; look at some of the caricatures of the 'New World Order' sometime.</i><br>
<p>
Any system will wind up with the end that its members deserve. If the members of an<br>
anarcho-capitalist society refuse to take personal responsibility for themselves,<br>
then they will wind up in the sort of tyrrany that you automatically assume any such<br>
society to be. Anarcho Capitalism is not, as a whole, beneficial for the stupid, the<br>
weak, or the faint of heart. This is a given. However, it is wrong for you to<br>
automatically assume that the members of such a society will all become completely<br>
subsumed by the most selfish, self-aggrandising personal drives, and will completely<br>
ignore such habits as personal charity, generosity, etc. It should be noted that the<br>
US, which most will agree is the 'most' capitalist economy in the world, leads the<br>
world in personal per capita giving, in both time and money, both in absolute terms<br>
and as a percentage of income and assets.<br>
<p>
Why is it that people living in socialist countries are individually selfish,<br>
materialistic, and ungenerous as compared to Americans???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ask an 'anarcho-capitalist' if they believe in (a) unrestricted private</i><br>
<i>&gt; ownership of thermonuclear weapons (i.e. the means of indiscriminate mass</i><br>
<i>&gt; murder) and (b) systematized murder (the 'death penalty'), all under their</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal control.  If they answer 'yes', (a) pre-emptively kill them if</i><br>
<i>&gt; they give you a funny look; or (b) run like hell!  &gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
Depends on whether YOU deserve it or not. If you respect them and give them a wide<br>
berth, then you are not likely to become a target, are you? If you were to go on<br>
making such wild, inflammatory, inaccurate statements about capitalism, individual<br>
liberty, etc, they might just deem you a threat and WILL nuke you, just for<br>
preventions sake....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Whereas Democratic Agorism already exists -- i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       <a href="http://www.agora.demon.co.uk/agora3.txt">http://www.agora.demon.co.uk/agora3.txt</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In practice, 'anarcho-capitalism' is 'salonfahig'; a fashionable fig-leaf</i><br>
<i>&gt; for existing privilege, and a time-sink and a pitfall for freedom-seekers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anarcho-capitalists usually attach themselves to right-wing conservatives</i><br>
<i>&gt; for company -- i.e. to right-wing pols like Thatcher, or 'intellectuals'</i><br>
<i>&gt; like Charles Murray).  Amusingly, many 'anarcho-capitalists' are State</i><br>
<i>&gt; agents of various kinds; nothing against State agents, you understand...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some of my best friends...  &gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
Funny, most people against anarcho-capitalism that I meet tend to be agents for World<br>
Federalism. Whose New World Order are you for???<br>
