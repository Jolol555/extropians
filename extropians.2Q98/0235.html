Frozen embryos develop normally, study shows <br>

LONDON (April 10, 1998 01:49 a.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) - Children born<br>
from frozen embryos are just as healthy as those conceived normally or<br>
through standard in-vitro fertilization, Swedish doctors said Friday.<br>
<p>
In a study published in the Lancet medical journal, Dr. Ulla-Britt<br>
Wennerholm and researchers at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg,<br>
Sweden, found no difference in developmental patterns in babies from<br>
cryopreserved, or frozen, embryos and other children.<br>
<p>
"The cryopreservation process does not adversely affect the growth and<br>
health of children during infancy and early childhood," she said.<br>
<p>
Up to 2 percent of all births in Sweden are from in-vitro fertilization.<br>
The sperm and egg are combined in a test tube and the resulting embryo is<br>
implanted in the womb. Fresh, or embryos frozen earlier, are used in the<br>
procedure.<br>
<p>
Wennerholm and her team monitored growth, major malformations and<br>
prevalence of chronic illness of 255 children from cryopreserved embryos,<br>
255 babies born after IVF with fresh embryos and 252 others conceived<br>
naturally during their first 18 months.<br>
<p>
They did not find any differences in the three categories.<br>
<p>
"Children born after cryopreservations as embryos develop and grow normally<br>
up to the age of 18 months, with no increase in physical or psychomotor<br>
impairment compared with children born after either standard IVF (in-vitro<br>
fertilization) or spontaneous pregnancies," they added.<br>
