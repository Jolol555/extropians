Yes, a bad choice of words from me. I couldn't find a more fitting <br>
term quickly enough. Actually that was the reason I put the word <br>
"healthy" between quotes. (I surely didn't mean "mental healthy" <br>
but at most "biological healthy") <br>
<p>
I was using this word with respect to the damage to the mental systems <br>
of a sentient being resulting from physical degradation prior to <br>
its death. I could have used the word "complete", but not only all <br>
its memories would have to be restored, but also other mental <br>
systems that perform certain functions (like communication centers, <br>
sensory input processing centers, etc...) Because I was also thinking <br>
about these latter parts of the mental system I think I used the <br>
word "healthy". (But you can see that I was already having doubts <br>
about this choice of words because I said the word "healthy" should <br>
be exactly defined first.)<br>
<p>
Perhaps more correct would be :<br>
<p>
"to reconstruct a normally functioning and completely memory intact <br>
mental system for the resurrected sentient being"<br>
