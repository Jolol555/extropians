How can CNET be that sloppy with their research?  They specifically<br>
mention the "myth" that VCRs and coffee-makers won't work after the year<br>
2000.  Then they dismiss this by claiming that home appliances don't<br>
care what year it is.<br>
<p>
This is false for some brands.  My VCR is set to record daily programs<br>
Monday through Friday.  When I try to put in the year "00" (it only<br>
allows two spaces), it says year 1900 and then records the wrong<br>
programs on the wrong day of the week.  I cannot program dates past the<br>
year 2000.  I cannot use day-of-the-week codes.<br>
<p>
 My coffee maker is also set to make coffee automatically Monday through<br>
Friday.  I haven't tested it, but if it misinterprets the year, it will<br>
be making coffee on the weekends and skipping coffee two week days a<br>
week.<br>
<p>
What bothers me is that CNET didn't say most of these devices will<br>
correctly calculate the year and will function correctly. CNET said that<br>
these devices don't care what the year is.  This is demonstrably false. <br>
I must question whether they really researched VCR's and Coffeemakers to<br>
see how they would function when the dates were set ahead.  Their<br>
explanation for why it doesn't matter is obviously false.<br>
<p>
The very fact that they asked different "experts" instead of simply<br>
programming a VCR or coffeemaker to see for themselves shows the lack of<br>
real research going into this article.  People interested in this and<br>
other computer bugs should read the "comp.risks" newsgroup.  It is full<br>
of technical explanation for how computers fail.  Computers fail much<br>
more easily than people think.  In most cases, it is false human<br>
expectations about the computer that causes the problem.  If this stuff<br>
interests you, or you want to hear from people who really research<br>
computer bugs, definitely read "comp.risks"!<br>
