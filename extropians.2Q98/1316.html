<i>&gt;       &gt;highly intelligent entities may completely lack sentience.</i><br>
<p>
        <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been asking this question for years on this list but have never received </i><br>
<i>&gt; an answer, if what you say is true what's the  point of sentience? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Intelligence has survival value, but if the two are unrelated why would </i><br>
<i>&gt; random mutation and natural selection bother to make anything sentient? </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me it would be like a fifth wheel, and yet I know for a fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution did bother to make at least one thing conscious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>

<p>
<p>
In this example, you're asking why random mutation and natural selection <br>
don't *bother* to make anything sentient. This is to endow 'random <br>
mutation and natural selection' with exactly that which 'evolutionary' <br>
proponents claim they cannot have -- intentionality and purpose.  For <br>
them, it's a universe of chance -- effect, effect, effect.<br>
<p>
<p>
John; You're here to provide superbly-phrased intelligent questions, and I <br>
-- qua setient being -- am here to provide you with tantalizing answers <br>
which require you to think, and to undergo a Gestalt-shift, a paradigm <br>
change.  I want you to see the role of purpose in a world of chance 9to <br>
quote W.H. Thorpe's title).<br>
<p>
<p>
   I carefully read your messages, and (sometimes) I am *moved* to respond <br>
   to them with *carefully chosen* words which I hope you (and others) <br>
   will read, and which may give you a new perspective which will enable <br>
   you to change the way you think.<br>
   <br>
   NO-ONE can explain how it is that my RAF jet pilot friend-of-a-friend, <br>
   who was outraged by the actions of 'his' government selling-out <br>
   Rhodesia, chose to fly his Hawker Hunter fighter UNDER two Thames <br>
   bridges, and to 'buzz' the Houses of Parliament...  &gt;:-}<br>
   <br>
   EITHER there is a direct causal cascade of events, so that everything <br>
   is 'effect, effect, effect' in a world of matter and energy (kinetic <br>
   and potential); OR we are 'beings endowed with colititional <br>
   consciousness' capable of _intitiating_ causal chains non-randomly.<br>
   <br>
   Intelligence may enable us to mediate (some) causal processes in some <br>
   way (a 'hidden mechanism' explanation).<br>
<p>
   For an interactionist dualist (a methodological, metaphysical choice) <br>
   there is a great, unsolved mystery about how _I_ will the matter in my <br>
   fingers to depress the keys on my keyboard, never mind originate the <br>
   words I type.  The neurological problem gets steadily harder as we move <br>
   away from my fingers.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   This quality of originating volitional consciousness we call <br>
   'sentience.'  <br>
   <br>
   Art tells the truth through the medium of inspired lies.  <br>
<p>
   Go see John Carpenter's magnificent film 'Christine: She's A Killer.'<br>
<p>
   The film shows the story of a murderous sentient 1958 crimson Plymouth <br>
   Fury, lovingly restored by a high-school student.  The car has a <br>
   'history...' The film is infinitely superior to Stephen King's book, in <br>
   which the car is haunted by the ghost of a Vienam vet.  In Carpenter's <br>
   film, the first sparks of life appear inexplicably in the car on the <br>
   production line.<br>
<p>
   The boy rebuilds the car from a ruin, and it/She gradually takes over <br>
   his life.  (Some say the film is a briliant metaphor for posssessive <br>
   individualism).  When envious high school kids attack and damage the <br>
   car, it/She glides out of the garage that night _all on its/Her own_ <br>
   and relentlessly hunts its/Her attackers down one at a time and <br>
   destroys them. She's indestructible, so any damage she suffers <br>
   self-repairs in the course of the action.  Christine isn't reacting to <br>
   an external cause in an 'intelligent' way. She's initiating a <br>
   horrifyingly powerful and focused destructiveness against people she <br>
   _hates_.<br>
<p>
    <br>
   Theodore Sturgeon's fine story 'Killdozer!' mediates a similar theme, <br>
   of a Caterpiller D-7 bulldozer becoming sentient, in that case when <br>
   it's taken over by an entombed non-physical alien entity.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Some of the Space Shuttle pilots will tell you how they go out to the <br>
    launch-pad early in the morning, and talk quietly with the 'ships that <br>
    sing.'.  I know what it's like to have high-performance vehicles act <br>
    like live things (I wouldn't be alive today if they hadn't).<br>
<p>
<p>
    If we could conclusively demonstrate telekinesis to you, would your <br>
    view be different?   ( Would we do a thing like that to you? &gt;:-} )<br>

PS: A friend of mine, Prof. Dwight Murphey, who wrote probably the finest <br>
book on Classical Liberalism (University press of America), [1979],[1982], <br>
is just now polishing his latest work, a superb study of 'The Warp-Speed <br>
Transformation of the World Economy', and how intelligent machines will <br>
make it impossible for Americans (or dollar-a-day latifundia peons, or <br>
South-east Asian sweatshop workers to compete in the new 'labout' market.  <br>
He argues clolsely that if Classical Liberalism fails to take account of <br>
this and speedily reconfigure its 'operating system', its valuses will be <br>
lost, with horrifying consequences.  He's a great writer, by the way.  He <br>
teaches Business Law at State University, Wichita.<br>
