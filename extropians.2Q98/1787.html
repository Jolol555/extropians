Well, this is a tricky point.  As you must know, Rand herself was quite<br>
hostile towards post-structuralism in particular, and I'm fairly certain<br>
that political postmodernism, at the very least, wouldn't sit well with<br>
her, though I can't recall her writing anything in particular about the<br>
postmodernists herself.  On the other hand, she was also quite hostile<br>
towards libertarians, a position which I find puzzling to say the least.<br>
<p>
As for hermeneutics, as I seem to recall, one of its central ideas was<br>
that supposedly contradictory elements within a text would coalesce into a<br>
meaning by virtue of the fact that they contradict.  Depending on which<br>
hemeneutic school you're addressing, this is either a restatement of<br>
Rand's flavor of the Aristotelian principle of non-contradiction or its<br>
very antithesis.  Is hermeneutics trying to say that the contradictions<br>
never truly existed, or that they are able to agree despite the fact that<br>
they contradict?  Different writers have answered this question<br>
differently; I think most modern academics would agree more with the<br>
latter than the former, and that Rand would disagree passionately. <br>
<p>
Anyway, I don't assert that poststructuralists are lying to try to get<br>
themselves better funding; rather that they may simply be wrong.  :) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The thing to do is to look dispassionately at the methods and ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, it seems that Sciabarra is onto something when he says</i><br>
<i>&gt; Objectivism is dialectical in method -- even if Objectivists don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  It might disagree with other dialectical philosophies, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hegelianism and Marxism, but this doesn't change his point.  Both</i><br>
<i>&gt; Newtonian and Einsteinian physics lead to different conclusions</i><br>
<i>&gt; despite having similar methods.</i><br>
<p>
I'm having a hard time reconciling these ideas in my mind, especially with<br>
respect to individuality vs. collectivism.  Applying the dialectic to<br>
politics, as Marx points out, seems to lead us to a certain inevitability<br>
in history.  I'm quite certain Rand would disagree with this, emphasizing<br>
instead the role of the individual in historical events.  Maybe I'm<br>
looking too much at the philosophy itself rather than its methods, but in<br>
my mind the two seem inseparable. <br>
