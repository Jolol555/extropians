----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: E. Shaun Russell &lt;e_shaun@uniserve.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         To me, the question of animal cryonics is one of "can we?"...not</i><br>
<i>&gt; physically, but psychologically.  With humans, the concept of cryonic</i><br>
<i>&gt; reanimation is mostly physical --generally, if a human is expecting to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryonically preserved, his reanimation may be quite disorienting and even</i><br>
<i>&gt; frightening, but it is, nonetheless, expected.  The problem with freezing</i><br>
<i>&gt; pets (let's say, for the sake of argument, dogs) is that there is (thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; far) no foreseeable way of training them to expect reanimation.  </i><br>
<p>
Neither is there a way to fully prepare them for an operation (with full<br>
anaesthetics etc), yet any "good" pet owner won't hesitate to have<br>
his pet treated in order to save its life. Cryonics doesn't differ fundamentally<br>
from a (potentially) life-saving operation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Could a</i><br>
<i>&gt; dog, upon reanimation, understand where it is, when it is, why and how?</i><br>
<p>
If you let it "wake up" in a familiar environment it won't suffer future shock.<br>
Pets have proven to be very adaptable, dogs for example usually<br>
have no problem with living in a completely unnatural environment with<br>
alien beings (in a house with humans). So you could gradually introduce<br>
them to the future world, and soon they wouldn't even know any better.<br>
Apart from that, by the time we have the means to revive frozen animals<br>
and people, there will almost certainly be very advanced emotion control <br>
possibilities which would elliminate stress alltogether, if so desired.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If</i><br>
<i>&gt; not, then the question of ethics is indeed a pertinent one...one that</i><br>
<i>&gt; extends into the realm of volition.  Can a dog choose to be cryonically</i><br>
<i>&gt; frozen?  Certainly not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dogs (and most other animals) don't have the volition needed to make such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice.  Does this mean that we can choose for them?  An interesting thought.</i><br>
<p>
Our superior abilities give us the privilege (and the responsibility) to decide <br>
the fate of lesser beings. If you assume that life is better than death (and <br>
transhumanism does, I belief) and that we will be able to shape the future, than <br>
saving your pet by freezing it is the morally correct thing to do, imo. Killing<br>
someone/thing that wants to live is worse than saving someone/thing that<br>
wants to die, because the former has no choices left while the latter can <br>
still take his life later, if he still wants to. Death is the end of freedom, so<br>
to speak. Since we don't know what our pets "think" about this, it's better<br>
to be on the safe side. Also one could argue that a deathwish never really<br>
is a deathwish, but the desire to end suffering. Mental and/or physical<br>
shortcomings that make one want to kill himself can presumably be<br>
fully cured in the future, which is another argument to freeze without<br>
consent.<br>
