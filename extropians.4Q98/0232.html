  IAN: Yes! I just transcribed that myself after 
  printing it from the microfilm at the library.

  The featured scientist, Dr Delgado, also wrote 
  a book called "Physical Control of the Mind: 
  Toward a Psychocivilized Society." It seems, 
  if much of the material on him on the net is 
  true, that he was a open advocate for the mass 
  implantation of brain chips -- chips a'hoy! -- 
  to reach the goal of a "Psychocivilized Society."
  The military has been vary interested in his work.

<a name="0239qlink1">  IAN: I wondered how could it be that 33 years 
  after that article was written it still sounds
  like science fiction. I found it fascinating 
  because whenever the topic of remote mind 
  control comes up, the routine reaction seems 
  to be claims that it cannot be done, that it's 
  crazy talk and then the next things mentioned 
  are usually Elvis, UFOs, and Area 51 -- but 
  not necessarily in that order. I guess that 
  makes it all the more eerie when you uncover 
  a 33 year old article where what I'm told by 
  educated people cannot to be done today, was 
  done routinely almost a half century ago. Do
  you realize how much all sciences have evolved
  since 1965? 65 was virtually the stone age; computers
   that fit in your hand then were 5000 lbs.</a>

<p>
  The status of the type of mind control experiments
   conducted by Dr Delgado seems to be of the 
  classified military variety. In fact, it was such 
  classified research that the US military contracted 
  Dr Delgado to do. It's a pretty disturbing situation 
  if we can see it through the haze of "crazy, UFO, 
  Area 51" rhetoric. I got the cite for the article
  I just transcribed from on of these articles,  
  which have some surprising information:
