<p>
If everybody carried a gun it's not clear if there would be more violence or
less. If somebody lost control of their temper the odds of them committing a
murder rather than just inflicting a punch in the nose would increase, but on
the other hand the odds of them actually lousing control of their temper would
decrease because they'd know they probably wouldn't survive such an encounter.
Also massacre spree killing would be virtually impossible.

<a href="1747.html#1756qlink2">     &gt;Your theory is that the fear of a long sentence will make them think</a><br>
<i>     &gt;twice about programming themself for violence.</i><br>


<p>
If a criminally violent person is in jail at least he will be unable to act
violently against me, although he can still murder other prisoners and often
does just that. If a man is convicted of murder and yet manages to kill again
then that is as great a failure of the legal system as executing an innocent
person. For this and other reasons I don't think anybody should be in jail
longer than 10 years.

<a href="1747.html#1756qlink3">     &gt;punishment does not seem to have the wanted effect. Thus the empirical</a><br>

<p>
If I believed that I would advocate opening all the prisons and letting
everybody out. I don't.

<p>
Apply the proper voltage, they won't run the right program but at least they'll
never run the wrong one again.

     &gt;It's not ok to slander people when they're alive and it's still not ok<br>
     &gt;after they die.<br>


<p>
It's not nice to slander people but it should never be the law's business. Let
the reader determine for himself if what I say is true or not. If it really is
slander then my own reputation will soon suffer more than the person I talk
about. I hope our British list members will correct me if I'm wrong but there I
don't think a distinction is made between the living and the dead regarding
slander. At least the USA hasn't made that blunder yet.
