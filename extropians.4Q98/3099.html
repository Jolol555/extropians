That assumes a "perfect world" where only the actual killer would ever
be charged, convicted, and executed. In reality, mistakes happen and
innocent people have been "murdered" by the justice system. Remember
"two wrongs don't make a right"? Perhaps a better question would be: "In
the event of your murder, and the subsequent conviction of the alleged
killer, would you want the death penalty imposed?"

<p>
Followed by: "Even if he claimed he didn't do it?" and: "How would you
feel if he was executed<a name="3107qlink1"> and later found to be not guilty?"</a>

<p>
I support the death penalty only in cases where the murderer agrees to
it or guilt is established beyond a shadow of doubt--which is *very*
hard to do. The damage caused by applying the death penalty</a> to an
innocent person *far* outweighs any of its potential benefits.
