<a href="3076.html#3277qlink1">&gt; I am living in Laconia, which is in central NH.  There may be</a><br>
<i>&gt;towns in NH that have very little in the way of tech-gear, but nothing is</i><br>
<i>&gt;ever very far away.  Being in a small city, I have two Walmarts each</i><br>
<i>&gt;within 10 minutes of my home.  We have numerous chain stores and dining</i><br>
<i>&gt;locations all over NH, in addition to the small, as you say, "mom and pop"</i><br>
<i>&gt;stores.  As Mike Lorrey pointed out, we have several top-notch malls in</i><br>
<i>&gt;our state, as well as numerous "plaza" shopping locations.  We have</i><br>
<i>&gt;several Barnes and Noble stores, Borders, Computer City, CompUSA, et.al.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Everything that we could ever need is right here.  However, one can always</i><br>
<i>&gt;climb into the car and within 10 minutes find themselves in the middle of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the woods, or hiking a mountain, seemingly miles away from civilization.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is the beauty of NH, and Northern New England in general.  We have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the conveniences of modern life, perhaps more so than others, yet we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;integrated it seamlessly (usually) with the surrounding natural beauty.</i><br>

<p>
    Well put, Roderick.
<br>
Spike, I know you were just kidding, I just want to share how I came to be
here.

<p>
    In a previous post I mentioned that I moved from Colorado to New
Hampshire for "quality of life" purposes. A year prior to moving here, my
wife and I flew out here from Colo. to get married. (her parents live here).
The contrast with Denver was
<br>
incredible. I fell in love with it. The way new englanders are able to
integrate natural beauty with everyday living amazed me.
A year later I found a more satisfying job and I've never been happier.
