<p>
<a name="0275qlink1">I guess I'm using the term free will to mean purposeful action free from
subconscious or environmental determinants, predispositions, or influence.</a>

<p>
I'm not comfortable trying to represent Gazzanaga's views since I don't
currently own and can't refer to any of his books or articles.  But it just
seemed to me that:

<p>
<a name="0259qlink1">(A1)   if, as I believe he suggests, a part of my brain is constructing a
<pre>
          best-fit storyline to account for the actions of other neural sub-
          systems, and
</pre>
<br>
<a name="0268qlink2">(A2)   if this story is a mixture of interpretation and confabulation,</a> and
(A3)   if I perceive that *I* am the story being told by the story-teller,
then

<p>
(B)     Isn't the notion of self an illusion?  (and isn't this an
increasingly
<p>
          popular theory among consciousness researchers?)</a>

<p>
So where is free will being expressed?  Can free will exist if the self is
an illusion?  It's not being expressed by my story-teller. He's not
directing activity, he's just trying to make sense of everything the subsystems
 are doing.  So is free will being expressed by the individual
sub-system or groups of sub-systems?  Maybe.  I don't know.

<p>
I'll withhold extended discussion until I've had a chance to read Dennett's
book.  Thanks for the reference, Max.  I enjoyed his interview on the PBS
series, "The Glorious Accident".   I look forward to reading a more indepth
 discussion on the matter because, like you, I believe that technology
will be our ticket to increased levels of free will.
