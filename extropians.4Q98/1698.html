I dunno whether it's Extropian (only Max knows ;-) , but it certainly
is rational.   Yes. I'd like to add that IMO, the punishment should fit the
crime;
<br>
serial killers/mass murderers/people who tortured their victims etc.
should receive harsher death penalties than someone who kills
just one victim in a relatively humane way. I also support corporal
punishment for violent offenders, btw.

<p>
&lt;Paul&gt;<br>

You claimed it is rational, but you have yet to demonstrate it.  All you've
said is an 'eye for eye' - since when is equal or greater vengeance
<a name="1702qlink2">rational?</a>  Vengeance is an *emotional* response, not a rational one.</a>

<p>
&lt;Den Otter&gt;<br>
<br>
<a name="1702qlink3">Of course, the whole justice system would have to be revised
before any executions can start.
<br>
Main changes:
<br>
 --no age limit

<p>
&lt;Paul&gt;<br>
<br>
So your advocating that we start killing 6 year olds?  How compassionate</a> of
you!

<p>
&lt;Den Otter&gt;<br>
<br>
<a name="1702qlink4">--video/audio footage (nation-wide camera system  in public
places with central databanks).

<p>
APaul&gt;
<br>
Extropianism is about decentralizing knowledge and power.  Your advocacy of
creating a centralized databank is antithetical to this.</a>

<p>
&lt;den Otter&gt;<br>
<br>
<a name="1702qlink5">--lay juries are abolished

<p>
&lt;Paul&gt;<br>
<br>
That my friend is a slippery slide towards totalitarianism.  A jury of ones
peers is so fundamental to a free legal system, that any argument against it
smacks of a system ruled not by people, but by decree.  Very un-extropian.</a>


<p>
&lt;Den Otter&gt;<br>
<br>
<a name="1702qlink6">--executions within a week or so after trial, unless hard
evidence is presented by the defense.

<p>
&lt;Paul&gt;<br>
<br>
So your advocating a system 'guilty until proven innocent'?</a>  If so, I have no
further comment, because your entire argument rests on a value system that
does not value the rights of an individual.  Very Cardassian.

<p>
&lt;den Otter&gt;<br>
<br>
<a name="1702qlink7">--killing a cryonicist in such a way that his brain is
damaged beyond any conceivable repair (i.e. burning,
rotting to a pulp, exploding etc.) should be punished
especially severely (slow &amp; painful death).

<p>
&lt;Paul&gt;<br>
<br>
Again, you are advocating vengeance through *torture*.  How is this rational
or extropian?  How will torture solve the problem? Your position is becoming
increasingly silly and absurd!</a>

<p>
&lt;den Otter&gt;<br>
<br>
<a name="1702qlink8">--massive centralized surveillance system, for evidence and prevention.

<p>
&lt;Paul&gt;<br>
<br>
Again, how is this extropian?  Your advocating a centralized system - and who
decides who will manage this system?</a>
