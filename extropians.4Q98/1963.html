So, you're so proud of your reptilian brain that you want to make a profit
from it's use?

<p>
Please examine China's policy of executing prisoners before recommending
this idea again.  It pains me to see people on this list spouting opinions
with no bearing on their outcome.

<p>
I'll re-quote Mike Lorrey on this topic:

<p>
"Putting a profit motive before the state would cause the state</a> to seek to
expand the penalty to more and more crimes. Even, and especially, in a
popular
<br>
democracy, with an aging population, there will be public pressure to expand
the
</a><br>
penalty to more and more crimes."

<p>
BTW, for those who seemed to have forgotten what extropy means, here is a
definition from Max More's original Lextropicon:

<p>
EXTROPY: A measure of intelligence, information, energy, life, experience,
diversity, opportunity, and growth. The collection of forces which oppose
entropy.

<p>
Now, are you someone who claims to be an extropic individual while
simultaneously advocating that a centralized state kill people for money?
