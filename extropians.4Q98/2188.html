Hi.  I'm up here in Seattle at the moment, making a big skunkworks
kind of stink, in order to accelerate the downfall of Microsoft and
the uprising of superscalar ram fabs for no-moving-parts hard drive 
emulators.

<p>
When I was 18 years old, I worked at Computer Sciences Corporation in 
Lompoc, CA, as a Data Technician.  One of the things we did there was 
Terrain Mapping radar for data that went inside of cruise missiles.  
Back in the old days, before GPS, we needed terrain maps to be stored 
inside the missile, so it could use nose-mounted phase-array radar to 
slip through the hills to its destination.  The Tomahawk would 
compare the stored data against it's real time scans.

<p>
Back in those days, that kind of processing power was expensive, thus 
making the $1 million per/missile price tag justifyable.

<p>
Then we put up GPS.  Of course, then the price tags of the missiles 
went down to $250,000.00 per missile.

<p>
After leaving CSC, I went up to the Seattle Area, and lived at 724 S. 
231st Place, in Des Moines, WA.  I was renting the basement floor of 
a two story house on the beach in Puget Sound.  Cooincidentally, my 
next-door neighbor was the President of Boeing Aerospace. I think he 
still lives there, although he's now enjoying retirement.

<p>

Nowdays, GPS circuits are being placed on chips, and soon to be in 
Ericsson and Nokia cell phones.  See the following:

This leads me to wonder, where do you find a good chemist, capable of 
puting the C4 explosives into *every* plastic case for *every* cell 
phone, just in case.  It's such a headache to have to retrofit the 
battery packs, it would be much easier to just build it into the 
plastic from the start.  It's all about bang for the buck. Which begs 
the question, who gets to keep the detonation activation codes?

<p>
Anyway, back to the no-moving-parts hard drives:

<p>
It's nice to Quantum making an attempt at solid state hard disks:

<p>
But look at the size of these things!  It would be so much more 
efficient just to reroute the Microsoft fortune to superscalar ram 
fabs.  We could keep the form factor of good old fashioned head on a 
silver platter ancient SCSI A/V technologies:

<p>
<a name="2195qlink1">All the disc array hardware could stay the same, for now, except the 
hard drives themselves would just be superscalar ram wavers, instead 
of platters!  Gee, what a concept!  Time to bring back Melinda and 
have her pull out the check book.</a>

<p>
Now, what to do with Washington D.C., the White House, and the 
Senate and the House of Representatives?

<p>
See <a href="http://www.disney.com/DisneyWorld/ThemeParks/index.html">http://www.disney.com/DisneyWorld/ThemeParks/index.html</a>

<p>
I'm for giving Disney a contract to turn the place into a Theme Park 
with old style herky-jerky animatronic droids.  Oviously, the place 
is currently filled with a puppet show cast of characters, but 
unfortunately, today's puppet technology is so advanced that the 
tourists are getting confused and thinking that these are all real 
people with independent thoughts.  It's probably better that we go 
back to paper-mache style robots, just so nobody gets confused.
