<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only that, but I would vote for a provisio that mandates that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; executions are performed in a manner that allows essential organs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be harvested, and that such harvesting is required, so that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; murderers, unable to restore the lives they took, may at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; partially pay in kind by sustaining the lives of others.     Joe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll re-quote Mike Lorrey on this topic:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Putting a profit motive before the state would cause the state to seek to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; expand the penalty to more and more crimes. Even, and especially, in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; popular</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; democracy, with an aging population, there will be public pressure to expand</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; penalty to more and more crimes."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, are you someone who claims to be an extropic individual while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; simultaneously advocating that a centralized state kill people for money?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Paul Hughes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Rather, to employ more lucrative lawyer-hours, we will delay, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; even deny, justice, only to save the lives of those most likely to take</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; others prematurely, at the expense of indubitably innocent lives</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which could be saved.  Exactly which planet are you from?  It can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be the one the rest of us humans live on.  I am a humanist and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know them well; humanists are my friends.  Paul, you're no humanist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh?  Most prominent Humanist organizations, such as the Unitarian Church, are</i><br>
<i>&gt; adamantly opposed to the Death Penalty.  Your ignorance is embarrassing. Which</i><br>
<i>&gt; planet are you on?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But your right I'm no humanist, I'm a transhumanist!  The need to kill and harvest</i><br>
<i>&gt; organs of others guilty of murder are qualities of a domesticated primate species</i><br>
<i>&gt; called humans (that of greed and vengeance), that I'm doing everything in my power</i><br>
<i>&gt; to escape.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rather than see us continue a perpetual cycle of vengeance in the name of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'JUSTICE' (a slippery concept if there ever was one!), I'd rather see an emphasis</i><br>
<i>&gt; on rehabilitation - something the US prison system has so far shown very little</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest in.  Since I don't expect the emotional intelligence of the average</i><br>
<i>&gt; person to increase much in the near future, I've focused my efforts instead on</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting off this primitive rock of savage domesticated primates and heading for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the stars as soon as possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<a name="2019qlink1">Most death penalty opponents have never had a family member 
murdered; the change in their opinions that occurs when this 
happens is remarkable.  And just exactly how would you rehabilitate 
a Ted Bundy, or a Jeffrey Dahmer, or a John Wayne Gacy?   Joe
