Except for those people who have no useful skills, who have no means of
getting money.  They will be better off once they recieve training and are
helped into work.  60% extra nothing is still nothing.

<p>
<a name="2545qlink1">Example (albeit a personal one).  My Girlfriend was</a> recently diagnosed as
<a name="2545qlink2">schizophrenic.  She spent apporximately 2 years in and out</a> of hospitals and
<a name="2545qlink3">is now on drugs which help most of the time.  With help</a> and time she'll be
<a name="2566qlink2"><a name="2545qlink4">able to get herself back into society and earn a living (which should
include paying off the money spent on her by the health service).</a>  She had
<a name="2545qlink5">no money and still has none.  She will have eventually (once she</a> is better).
<a name="2545qlink6"><a name="2530qlink1">In a pure capiutalist society she would have starved to death by now.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2566qlink3"><a name="2545qlink7"><a href="2505.html#2518qlink6">&gt;Yes there will still be people who fall off the bottom of the system,</a><br>

insurance,
<br>
<a href="2505.html#2518qlink8">&gt;or are dependents of people who do so. That, sir, is life.</a><br>

<p>
It is life for you.  It is not life for me.  And I shall remain</a> in a country
<a name="2545qlink8">where it is not life.  And lobby for it to be life everywhere,</a> becasue to do
