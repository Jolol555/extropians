OK.  Well then, since "property is theft," you're advocating theft.  Do I
understand you correctly?

<p>
I understand your dilemma, but consider this: the more and faster the
economy grows, the fewer people die, ceteris paribus.  Now there is no
doubting that some people will die whether society pursues libertarian
capitalism or whether society pursues tax-spend capitalism.  The question
is whether MORE people would die under libertarianism than under a welfare
state.

<p>
Libertarianism has an added advantage compared to welfare, namely, that it
will get us to immortalizing technology much faster than will a welfare
state (again, thanks to the rapid economic growth).  I put it to you that
since a libertarian economy grows so much faster than an economy on welfare
does, fewer people will die if society pursues capitalism than will die if
society pursues welfare.

<p>
The argument that welfare saves lives through mandatory charity for the
poor is dubious.  Private charity can and does surpass gov't charity, both
in quantity and in quality.  In addition, there is plenty of data showing
that charity increases as the economy grows; thus welfare ultimately leads
to less charity, rather than more, in the long run.

<p>
Thus, since libertarianism saves more lives than welfare, we should endorse
libertarianism and reject welfare.
