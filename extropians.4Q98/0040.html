<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Uh, I don't think so. If all AI machines were treated with a slave</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;existence, then biological humanity as a whole would develop an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;aristocratic level of wealth based on the uncompensated profits from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;productivity of the AI machines. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Perhaps, but I don't at all see how this is contrary to what I said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, for example, if the average compensation level for a machine</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence were $0.00, while the average compensasion level for a biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;human level intelligence were $30,000.00, you could state accurately that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;average wage level would drop to $15,000.00 if half the work force were AI.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, no legally human entity's wage would drop. Moreover, since the</i><br>
<i>&gt;biological human's productivity would be seen to rise (as the AI's he or she</i><br>
<i>&gt;manages increase their productivity), then the human's wage should rise to</i><br>
<i>&gt;compensate for this rise in productivity. This sceanario directly contradicts</i><br>
<i>&gt;the implied conclusions of your paper, that introduction of machine</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence would lead to poverty for all....</i><br>

<p>
I did not say "poverty for all".  My results are consistent with either of 
these extremes: humans get all consumption, or they are get just as 
much per capita as machine intelligences.  Perhaps you could read what I 
said before you disagree with it?  (see <a href="http://hanson.berkeley.edu/aigrow.pdf">http://hanson.berkeley.edu/aigrow.pdf</a>)
