<p>
<a href="1650.html#1657qlink2">&gt; "Is the Death Penalty Extropian?"</a><br>

<p>
Ah, the death penalty! One of my favorite topics...
I dunno whether it's Extropian (only Max knows ;-) , but it certainly
is rational.
 
<p>
<a href="1650.html#1657qlink3">&gt; We welcome all comments on this, please state your reasons as</a><br>
<i>&gt; thoroughly as you can.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First of all, by definition, the death penalty is not murder.</i><br>

<p>
Quite right.
 
<p>
<a href="1650.html#1657qlink4">&gt; Murder: 1) to kill a person unlawfully and with malice. (Websters</a><br>
<i>&gt; new world dictionary) </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Second,I feel that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the unlawful and malicious killing of a fellow human being.</i><br>

<p>
Yes. I'd like to add that IMO, the punishment should fit the crime;
serial killers/mass murderers/people who tortured their victims etc.
should receive harsher death penalties than someone who kills
just one victim in a relatively humane way. I also support corporal
punishment for violent offenders, btw.
 
<p>
<a href="1650.html#1657qlink5">&gt; I feel that the death penalty has it's problems however, it is</a><br>
<i>&gt; often applied with a racial bias, and when it is decided upon, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; takes too long to administer.</i><br>

<p>
Of course, the whole justice system would have to be revised 
before any executions can start.
<br>
Main changes:
<pre>
--"insanity" plea is abolished.  
--no age limit
--no gender/race/whatever bias
--convictions on hard evidence only, such as forensics,
</pre>
video/audio footage (nation-wide camera system in public
places with central databanks)
<br>
--lay juries are abolished
<br>
--executions within a week or so after trial, unless hard
evidence is presented by the defence
<br>
--standard option of cryopreservation upon execution
--"manslaughter" as a result of aggression (like beating
someone up without intent to kill) or severe risk taking
(drunk driving, unsafe gun handling) is punished as
murder (death penalty).
<br>
--killing a cryonicist in such a way that his brain is
damaged beyond any conceivable repair (i.e. burning,
rotting to a pulp, exploding etc.) should be punished 
especially severely (slow &amp; painful death).
--same for destroying a brain in suspension
--(option) executions done publicly in sport stadiums 
(tickets required), footage sold to commercial TV stations 
etc. Money made by these means can help to finance the 
justice system, and a part can go to (family of) the victims.

<p>
For good measure: 
<br>
--all "victimless crimes" legalized. Police can focus on the real
crimes, and much less officers are needed (you save $$$).
--national (global?) DNA and fingerprint databank (for *all* citizens),
of course with very restricted access and firm penalties for abuse.
--jails must be automated. No physical contact between guards and 
inmates or between the inmates themselves. 1 person per cell,
wholesome food and possibility for exercise, but no recreation.
Possibly self-sustained labor camps.
<br>
--massive centralized surveillance system, for evidence and prevention.
All government agents, including the police and judiciary, must wear
video/audio equipment at all times while on the job.
--heavily automated justice system (one for the whole country, or
better yet, world). Precedents are binding, as consequence is one
of the pillars of justice.(*)
<br>
--society (especially the economy) must be automated as much as 
possible so that everyone can receive a decent standard of living
*without having to work*. 
<br>
--the press is not allowed to reveal details of criminal investigations 
and trials, unless cleared by the authorities. Names are only released
after sentencing.
<pre>
--right to keep and bear arms
--right to kill intruders (on private property)
--right to kill in self-defense
--right to hold a duel (in specially designated places or on private
</pre>
property that's sufficiently isolated. The entire event must be
recorded by camera, all involved must participate out of free will).
--people who fear that they might commit a (violent) crime because
of "urges", can get free treatment from the government.

<p>
(*)[Justice: punishing harmful acts in a consequent manner and so that
the punishment fits the crime]
 
<p>
<a href="1650.html#1657qlink6">&gt; I do not feel deterrence is a prerequisite for it's existence, but</a><br>
<i>&gt; I feel that if it was applied fairly, equitably, and quickly, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have a deterrent effect.</i><br>

<p>
Agreed. The surveillance system in combination with relatively
few but firmly enforced laws should virtually wipe out crime.
I bet that with a system like this you could even put Russia back 
on its feet...

<p>
Conclusion: if you want to do capital punishment right, it has to
be part of a much larger package of progressive and rational
amendments. In the justice system as seen in for example
America today, I wouldn't recommend capital punishment.
