<a name="0654qlink1">Is it just wild-eyed idealism on my part? It seems to 
me that by the time we have the ability to make highly
stategic genomic modifications, individuals will 
also have the ability to choose whatever body type 
they prefer.  The Transhumanistic ideal would be that 
anyone who had been genetically modified would at any 
time have the liberty of choosing between any number 
of body types.</a>

<p>
We don't have to worry about a 6-handed version of a 
human living and working on a space station being 
condemned to that body type and that body type alone.
One's brain should be quite transplantable by the time 
we have the technology to construct 6-handed humans.
Of course, I could be entirely wrong.

<a name="0654qlink2">BTW, watched a Deep Space Nine episode tonight 
about a group of genetically enhanced mutants.  
Basically they've been ostracized and institutionalized
despite their intellectual superiority.  Thing is . . . they're
a bit eccentric.  Except for Dr. Bashir (sp?), the one that 
was able to fit in, hiding and protecting his transhumanistic 
identity.  I've also noticed that the new version of "The 
Outer Limits" frequently has episodes with transhumistic
themes.
