<p>
You are confused.  What do you know of corporate taxation?  The
corporations are taxed (on revenue) at about the same rate as wealthy
individuals, which is to say they are taxed a lot more than most
individuals.  And corporations have to deal with double taxation; when
profits are disbursed to shareholders they are taxed again at the
shareholders income tax rate.  Nevermind the other miscellaneous taxes that
corporations have to pay that most people aren't even aware of.

<p>
The currently high levels of corporate taxation and double taxation issues
are the motivating factors behind the trend towards alternative forms of
value distribution.  Even then, taxes paid are generally higher than what
most individuals pay.  Using traditional channels of distributing profit to
shareholders (such as dividends), the taxation at all levels is often
around 70-80%.

<p>
As for corporate welfare, the vast majority of corporations receive no such
aid in any form.

<p>
It galls me every time I see the "evil corporations rule the world with
impunity" meme that seems to cross this list semi-regularly.  This dogma
would never be espoused by individuals who actually have first hand
knowledge of corporate structures and administration, but it sure seems to
be popular with the less experienced in this area.
