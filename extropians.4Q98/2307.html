<p>
Because, like most ideals,  the system breaks down under certain
circumstances.

<p>
Take, as an example, garbage collection.  Everyone has garbage.</a>  None of us
<a name="2348qlink7">want it cluttering up our kitchens.  We coul set things up so</a> that each of
<a name="2348qlink8">us pays a small fee to have out rubbish picked up.  but some</a> people will
<a name="2348qlink9">decline to pay.  Now their rubbish is affecting me.  Should</a> I pay for their
</a>
<a name="2348qlink10">rubbish to be removed?  Or should we force them to pay gfor</a> their rubbish to
<a name="2348qlink11">be removed?  Or just have their steaming piles of decomposing</a> filth collect
<a name="2348qlink12">in the middle of the street?

<p>
<a name="2329qlink2">Another example: Neonatology - medicine as applied to babies.
A baby is born with a defect.  the baby is a person.  It has</a> no income and
<a name="2348qlink13">no resources.  Should it's parents be forced to pay for it, even</a> if they
<a name="2348qlink14">can't, even if they don't want to?  Should it be asked</a> for a credit card
<a name="2348qlink15">number when it's born?</a>

<p>
<a name="2329qlink3">Just two problems that pure libertarian capitalism has problems</a> with.

<p>
<a name="2329qlink4">I agree that Libertarian Capitalism works in 90% of all cases</a> and that it
<a name="2348qlink16">should eb left to do so as much as is physically possible.  But</a> no system
<a name="2348qlink17">works 100% of the time.
