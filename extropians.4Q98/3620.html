Here's some interesting stats on global connectivity for a sobering
reminder of how far out in front of everyone else we are....

<p>
You can look at the glass as being nearly empty and decry the injustice,
blah blah blah, or you can say, "Hey, I wonder if they'll pay me to fill
it for them?"

<p>
This global village we call home sure is one small place.  
Thanks to telephones, TVs and computer networks, it's  
a cinch to chat with friends in Korea, watch war in Iraq  
and shop at a Chilean e-tailer. 
 
<p>
Keep in mind, though, that not every resident of our pint-sized  
planet is so fortunate. While we wired ones enjoy windows  
on the world, most of our fellow Earthlings don't even  
have phone service -- let alone Internet access. 
 
<p>
I mention this disparity in connectivity not to induce  
guilt. But to bring the recent Internet explosion into  
context -- and to point out geographic challenges and  
opportunities. Herewith, a global guide to who's wired  
and who isn't: 
 
<p>
Headcount.com: When considering e-business abroad, check  
this slick site to measure -- and compare -- Internet  
connectivity rates around the world. Headcount.com knows  
the score in every country from Australia (3.3 million  
Netizens) to Vietnam (6,000). Click for more. 
 
<p>
Nua Internet Surveys: As its headline says, this page  
attempts to answer, "How many online?" Quick fact: There  
are 87 million Internet users in Canada and the United  
States, compared with less than a million in all of Africa.  
Click for more. 
 
<p>
It's a Wired Wired World? Interactive Week reports that  
most of the world has little infrastructure and few computers  
through which to communicate digitally. Click for more.  
Among other locales, this series of stories visits:

England: Cambridge the next Silicon Valley? Click for  
more. 
<br>
France: Both behind and ahead of the times. Click for  
more. 
<br>
South Africa, Australia: Unexpected hot spots. Click for  
more. 
 
 
<p>
Wired World Atlas: The folks at Wired magazine host a  
tour of the world's media use. Click for more. Among the  
thought-provoking highlights: 
 
<p>
65% of the world's households don't have a phone. 
71% of phone users in Cambodia are cell phone users. 
TV is illegal in Bhutan; VCRs, however, are OK. Click  
for more. 
 
 
<p>
South American IT Challenges: Despite geographic proximity,  
neighboring countries in South America (and elsewhere)  
often have vastly different communications situations.  
For example, as this CNN story reveals, Chile boasts easy  
and inexpensive digital connections, while the Brazilians  
next-door find hook-ups "frustrating and difficult." Click  
for more. 
 
<p>
Home-Grown Solutions: Here in the States, where 60 million  
PCs access the Net, pockets of under-served computer users  
remain. So what's a connectivity-challenged town to do?  
At least two pioneering places, in Oregon and Kentucky,  
are spending public-utility funds to hook up their cities: 
 
<p>
Ashland Fiber Network: $5 million will buy speedy fiber-optic  
lines for 16,000 customers. Click for more. 
Glasgow Electric Plant Board: $3 million brought broadband  
access to 14,000 citizens. Click for more.
