This is a case of don't believe everything you read on the WWW.
Here in Chicago there have been a number of sick incidents of this
type over the years, they've been both on T.V. and in the
newspaper.

<p>
After one particularly sick incident a few years ago (a needle)
people stopped letting their kids trick-or-treat. Hospital
emergency rooms here normally offer free x-ray of suspect items.

<p>
Check with your local big city newspaper morgue (archive).
