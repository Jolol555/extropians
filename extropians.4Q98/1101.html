<a href="1079.html#1101qlink1">&gt;I don't recall David Friedman advocating an abrupt change to Anarcho</a><br>
<i>&gt;Capitalism.  In fact, I'm not aware of him making any attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt;propose a transition from our current situation to Anarcho Capitalism.</i><br>


<p>
Sorry, I wasn't trying to imply that he was. I'm aware that he favours
building up the voluntary sector first,
<br>
I was just trying to draw a contrast between the anarcho-lib attitude to
reform which he built an intellectual foundation for (without necessarily
agreeing with the tactics of hard core libertarians) and the classical lib
attitude represented by his father. eg there are hard core libertarians who
want immediate separation of school and state even to the point of opposing
a voucher system. This, I think, is impractical.
