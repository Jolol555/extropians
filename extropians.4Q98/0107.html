<a name="0108qlink1">I'm posting this information about The Freeman, since I suspect that many
of you have never read an issue but may enjoy it. I'm an interested party,
having had two articles published in it, with another one in the works.</a>

Nothing is more basic to Western civilization than natural rights and 
individual liberty. 

<p>
Each month The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty tackles the basic principles of 
the free society and applies them to history and the issues of the day. 
For over 40 years, The Freeman has been the unwavering champion of the free 
society, offering the best in economic and political thought as well as 
book reviews and inspiring profiles of liberty's heroes. 

<p>
Who reads The Freeman? High school students. College students. 
Homeschooling moms, dads, and kids. Teachers and university professors. 
Computer programmers. Truck drivers. Entrepreneurs. Farmers. Doctors, 
lawyers, and accountants. Business executives. In short, Freeman readers 
are intelligent people with a passion for, or curiosity about, the free 
society. 

<p>
The Freeman has been home to the greatest libertarian and classical liberal 
thinkers of our time, including Ludwig von Mises, F. A. Hayek, Murray 
Rothbard, Henry Hazlitt, Israel Kirzner, Milton Friedman, James Buchanan, 
Julian Simon, and Leonard Read.

<p>
Its pages regularly sparkle with brilliant analysis by top advocates of the 
freedom philosophy, such as Thomas DiLorenzo, Jane Shaw, Robert Higgs, Jo 
Kwong, James Payne, Mark Skousen, Doug Bandow, and Walter Williams, among 
other economists, historians, political philosophers, and commentators. 

<p>
The best established voices of liberty, along with the most articulate of 
the newgeneration of pro-freedom scholars, are found here. Editor Sheldon 
Richman invites you to join them each month. Get a sample issue by writing
