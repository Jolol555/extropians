Jason Abboud is a cool guy.  Very down to earth.  He needs help, 
though, creating a strong demand for the product, since he wants to 
achieve excellent economies of scale, to keep costs down.

<p>
Maybe we could get him hooked up with Prof. Frank Dietz. 

<p>

Maybe we could get these *wireless* devices down to the $50/box 
prices that your 100base-T Ethernet cards are going for today, to 
produce a Linux-based parallel supercomputer that can house the CRIT 
(<a href="http://crit.org">http://crit.org</a>) frame-level HDTV annotation database and wavelet 
HDTV frame proxies.  (Maybe Larry Ellison will help with a shareware 
parallel version of Oracle?  It's all a game to these guys, right?  
Set the ego's aside: Bill slips Ted a couple B's to slip to Larry?)

<p>
Before you know it, we're all happy hempers!!

P.S. I talked to a guy today who's gone through a vasectomy.  He said 
they give you a local anesthetic, do you don't feel a thing.  A 
little aching for about a day, but they give you some good drugs to 
keep you distracted.  After that, you still shoot your loads just 
like before, it's just that they're seedless.  Maybe we can use door 
to door, office to office stealth, offering FREE GPS CELLPHONES with 
Vasectomies-Retirement Included!!  Why waste $20,000 on Detroit 
steel, when you can build a steel framed house for the same price?  
As for money for mingling with the 20th century tax-paying slaves, I 
maintain that special series U.S. $20's are much less conspicous than 
food coupons (See <a href="http://www.moneyfactory.com/currency/index.cfm">http://www.moneyfactory.com/currency/index.cfm</a>).

<p>
Haven't the USPTO and FTC really served their citizens well?

If there's any product in the world who's sale should be prevented, 
it's this one: <a href="http://www.etoys.com/html/et/et_swt0075_001.shtml">http://www.etoys.com/html/et/et_swt0075_001.shtml</a>
