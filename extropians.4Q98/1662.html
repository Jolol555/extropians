First, it raises very slippery, and currently unanswerable, questions about
the nature of identity - if we rewrite a major portion of your personality
to make sure you don't kill anyone else, are you really still you?  If the
answer is no, then we've just picked a high-tech method of execution.

<p>
Second, do you really think its a good idea for government to have the
authority to "fix" criminals?  Since there is no way to create an objective,
measurable definition of sanity that an arbitrary group of bureaucrat can
agree on, what we would end up with is sanity by committee.  After all, as
long as we're convincing you not to be a murderer, we may as well make sure
you aren't a rapist or a traitor either.  There is a natural tendency for
this kind of "treatment" to mutate into organized mind control over time,
and the only way I can see of avoiding the problem is to prohibit
involuntary personality alteration completely.
