<p>
One can't under-note (in light of the "herbs are dangerous"
scare-mongering being pushed by the GovtMedia as a subset of 
the effort to bring alternative medicine under totalitarian- 
Federal control similar to prescription drugs) the following 
<a name="0073qlink1">report from JAMA showing PRESCRIPTION DRUGS</a> to be "the sixth, 
and perhaps even the  fourth,  most  common cause of death"
(Wash. Post) killing over 100,000 Americans per year!!!

<p>
Where (X = herbs/vitamins) and (Rx = prescription drugs):
if X must be made less available if X may be dangerous, and 
if Rx is 100,000 times more dangerous than X, then surely Rx 
should be banned outright, but that's not the case, therefore
the expressed concern for safety is a false front, a Big Lie.

        ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS MAY
        CAUSE OVER 100,000 DEATHS AMONG
        HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS EACH YEAR

        Study suggests adverse drug reactions
        are among the top causes of death in U.S.

        CHICAGO - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
        in U.S. hospitals may be responsible 
        for more than 100,000 deaths nationwide 
        each year, making it one of the leading
        causes of death, according to an article 
        in the April 14 issue of The Journal of 
        American Medical Association (JAMA). 

        Bruce H. Pomeranz, M.D., Ph.D., and col-
        leagues from the University of Toronto, 
        analyzed 39 studies of ADRs in the United 
        States to estimate the incidence of serious 
        and fatal adverse drug reactions in hospital 
        patients. To obtain overall incidence rates 
        of ADRs in hospitalized patients, the re-
        searchers combined the incidence of ADRs 
        in the hospital and the incidence of ADRs 
        causing admission to the hospital.


      On 04/15/98, The Washington Post reported:

      PRESCRIBED DRUGS' TOLL IS AMONG DEADLIEST

        By Rick Weiss 

        More than 2 million Americans become 
        seriously ill every year because of 
        toxic reactions to correctly prescribed
        medicines taken properly, and 106,000 
        die from those reactions, a new study 
        concludes. That surprisingly high num-
        ber makes drug side effects at least 
        the sixth, and perhaps even the fourth, 
        most common cause of death in this country.

        The analysis, the largest and most 
        complete of its kind, suggests that 
        one in 15 hospital patients in the 
        United States can expect to suffer 
        from a serious reaction to prescription
        or over-the-counter medicine, and about 
        5 percent of these will die as a result.


     IAN: Important to note: the study seems only to have 
     included drugs prescribed to hospitalized patients,
     yet I would expect that most prescription drugs are
     prescribed to patients NOT hospitalized. If 106,000 
     hospitalized patients are killed by prescription 
     drugs, and if hospital prescriptions account for 
     (just a guess) 20% of all prescriptions, then there 
     could be upwards of 500,000 people dying every year 
     from prescription drugs (just a rough guestimate).
     While hospital patients are more sick and thus more
     inclined to die, out-patients are more inclinded to 
     drive cars and do other dangerous activity drugged.
     Suffice it is to say that there should be more than
     the cited 100,000 hospital-Rx-drug deaths in total.

                  - the critics are raving -

          "Shouldn't this be expunged?...[since]
         it is spreading fear and suspicion of the 
        government."  Lesly Sthal (CBS - 60 Minutes)

       Call the police! Newsday reports that "another 
       site linked to Goddard's" is linked to another 
       site that "pictures a woman's bare derrierre." 
        BTW, I'm still (drool) looking for that site

        On CNN, a  Federal official  said Goddard's 
         TWA 800 inquiry has caused "real damage." 
          ergo: stopping Goddard = damage control

             GIVING THE BIG LIE A BLACK EYE WITH 
               THE FIST OF ANALYTICAL INQUIRY
