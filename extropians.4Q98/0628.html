&lt;&lt; That dolphins don't have abstract language was recently
 established in a very elegant experiment. A pool is divided into two
 halves by a net. Dolphin A is released into one end of the pool where
</a> there is a mechanism. After a while, the dolphin figures out how to
 operate the mechanism which causes dead fish to be released into both
 ends of the pool. Then A is transferred to the other end of the pool
 and a dolphin B is released into the end of the pool that has the
 mechanism. The idea is that if the dolphins had a language, then A
 would tell B to operate the mechanism. However, it was found that the
 average time for B to operate the mechanism was the same as for A.

Perhaps dolphin A knew dolphin B would<a name="0646qlink2"> figure it out and let him have the

prize of discovery.
