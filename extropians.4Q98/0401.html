<a name="0451qlink1">ken i have been thinking for some time about a biomonitor that
would ride inside the urinary bladder.  i have a notion that such
a thing could be constructed, perhaps 2 cm in length
and not more than about 4 mm diameter so that it could be
inserted thru the urethra without surgery.  the device would
need some sort of telemetry to com link with instruments
outside the body.

<a name="0451qlink2">initially i thought such a device would monitor the chemistry of
the urine, perhaps giving some warning of conditions that lead
to kidney stones, however i now realize the device might be
applicable for monitoring other important functions.  spike
