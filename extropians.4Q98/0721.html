<p>
They have their security men to keep an eye on the scientists,
this goes especially for government research and big companies,
the two most likely sources of upload/AI technology. The guys
that pay for the research will no doubt make sure to check how 
their money is being spent.

<p>
Yes, but few of them have the "big picture" or the attitude to use
the technology for themselves. The guys that created the first 
A-Bomb were only allowed to "play" with it under strict government
supervision, and the same will most likely be the case here.</a> Of
<a name="0722qlink3">course, it could be that a group of scientists would keep the tech
for themselves and become gods, but it's not very likely. Wrong
mentality; they'll just meekly hand over the tools for godhood to
their masters.
