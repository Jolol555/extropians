ya, they seldom leave em standing if they are more than about 30 yrs.
i do get a laugh out of the things the historical societies consider worth
preservation: tacky tract shacks and so on.  there was this little hot
dog stand in san jose that is shaped like an orange.  the building is
shaped like an orange i mean.  historic.  been there since 1938.  oh
yes, the diving lady.  there was a little motel in santa clara with a neon
sign shaped like a diving lady (to advertise they had a pool).  this was a
marilyn monroe shaped woman in a weird looking one piece bathing suit
complete with rubber cap: the exteme in urban tackiness.  save it, been there
since 1951.  {8-[   but the garage where steve jobs and steve wozniak
started a revolution?  throw it out, post 1960.  {8-[  sigh.  spike
