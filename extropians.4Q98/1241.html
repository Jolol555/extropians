Perhaps -- though it may also be that human language is an
abstraction of music!

Nietzsche wished he had "sung" _Zarathustra_. Some 20th century
composers wished they had written novels (or political tractates).
Nietzsche was smarter, I think.

The question ultimately requires determining how much language
refers outside of itself. Tricky question, to be sure, and not just
for posties (people who refer to their beliefs as "post-modern,"
"post-structuralist," etc. -- also a kind of breakfast cereal with a
very, very high glycemic index).

Off to jam,
