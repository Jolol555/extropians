<a name="0169qlink1"><i>&gt; [1] Lego Toy Problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes. A very good way to attempt this is to use Lego blocks. (Seriously!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lego is developing a series of toys which can interface with the PC (about</i><br>
<i>&gt; $200, available this fall). For the moment these devices will be physically</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; too feeble to pick up the Lego blocks and push them together, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensor technology is also very crude. If you did have adequate actuators</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sensors (I can see it now, hydraulically driven Lego-Bots!), consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; the design of a Lego-Assembler, which given a suitable PC, and a suitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply of Lego blocks, is capable of assembling a copy of itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The point of such a 'toy problem' (groan) is to reveal the higher level</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceptual difficulties of doing such a thing and to reveal the detailed</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems of actually doing it. (like, how do you sense the difference from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a Lego block and a sugar cube?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The next Lego problem is to eliminate the major non-Lego components,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially the PC. Most solutions to this problem (in principle!) involve</i><br>
<i>&gt; combining a standard set of components, a general purpose assembler, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; data tape whose structure as a media is simple. The data tape is read and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the assembler executes the instructions. It builds the duplicate assembler,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then duplicates the tape.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I imagine such a device would be rather large. The assembler component on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the order of a cubic meter, and a kilometer of so of Lego blocks data tape</i><br>
<i>&gt; (if folded or on a spool, about the volume of my house. And it would run</i><br>
<i>&gt; verrrrrry slowly, maybe a few years to complete the reproduction).</i><br>

<p>
The size of the data tape is dependent on the structure of the media. A 4mm
tape cartridge, for example, has anywhere from 60-120 meters of 4mm wide tape
on it, and can hold about 250megs per meter at present desk top technology
levels. An older media, 9 track tape reels, can hold 6250 bytes per inch, and
have anywhere from 800-3600 feet of tape on them. Your Lego brand data tape is
going to be what? punch tape???<a name="0169qlink2"> ;)  You could use the pins on a lego block for
a media, if you wanted. A 2x8 pin block would represent 1 byte,</a> where every set
<a name="0169qlink3">of 2 pins is your 0 and 1 bit positions. Using this as a media structure, you
definitely would have a memory space the size of a house to do</a> anything useful,
<a name="0169qlink4">given a conventional sized Lego block.</a>

<p>
<a name="0169qlink5">To go more compact, you would use a 2x8 block as a punch tape</a> reading head, and
<a name="0169qlink6">a similar block as the writing head. Roll the punch tape up onto a spool.
However, using tape is getting away from the standardized Lego</a> building blocks.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0161.html#0164qlink2">&gt; This would provide a look at the challenges involved, given a an assembler</a><br>
<i>&gt; a priori.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [2] The Trouble with Nanobots and a Solution</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We have all seen by now the little video clips of futuristic nanobots</i><br>
<i>&gt; flying like tiny Tie Fighters though the bloodstream, searching for Bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; Biological Blobs and replacing them with Beautiful Beneficent Bits. Here</i><br>
<i>&gt; are a few of the many problems with this dramatic concept:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Energy source</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Locomotion</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Orientation</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Co-ordination with other Bots</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Positional Uncertainty</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The first four are obvious enough. Nanobots will be subject to Brownian</i><br>
<i>&gt; motion at non cryogenic temperatures. Flying or swimming through a fluid</i><br>
<i>&gt; medium will always result in this. The fact that you can see Brownian</i><br>
<i>&gt; motion in a light microscope proves the point. At a less visible level,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's the Heisenberg uncertainty to deal with. The smaller the object,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the more difficult it is to establish the position. The current research</i><br>
<i>&gt; involves STMs and objects bonded to large substrate, so the uncertainty is</i><br>
<i>&gt; far smaller than the atoms being manipulated.<a name="0169qlink7"> Nanobots are tiny indeed.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, are we talking bacterial sized bots or smaller??</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0161.html#0164qlink3">&gt; An array of assemblers firmly mounted on a suitable support structure</a><br>
<i>&gt; answers many of these problems. This requires that the object being</i><br>
<i>&gt; assembled be in the solid state. Assembly at cryogenic temperatures makes a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of sense. Things will stay where you put them, you can use high vacuum</i><br>
<i>&gt; without damaging the placement of volatile molecules such as H2O, etc. Very</i><br>
<i>&gt; large computing resources can interfaced to the assembler instead of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited to the tiny volumes of nanobots.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; An assembly plate with a square meter of area would suffice for reanimation</i><br>
<i>&gt; work.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0161.html#0164qlink4">&gt; [3] Warming Up</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Another advantage of cryogenic temperatures is that cells could be (in</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle!) constructed in the solid state with every molecule in place. No</i><br>
<i>&gt; ice crystals. No latent heat to complicate warming. If you can get from 77</i><br>
<i>&gt; Deg K to 1 Deg K in a very short time (1 millisecond at the most), warming</i><br>
<i>&gt; from there to body temperature without further damage has been proven (I</i><br>
<i>&gt; recall a hamster at Alcor).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To do this, warming elements must be finely distributed through the body,</i><br>
<i>&gt; close enough that thermal conduction will warm the immediate vicinity</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the millisecond time frame, which implies a distribution of elements</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few cell lengths apart. One idea for this is tiny wires coated with or</i><br>
<i>&gt; comprised of diamondoid material with a conductive center. A 100 Kg body</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires about 8 x 10^5 joules delivered in a 1 ms pulse of 8 x 10^10 watts</i><br>
<i>&gt; (100 gigawatts, approximately).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The wires are assembled into the body during construction, and pulled out</i><br>
<i>&gt; after the warming pulse. At 1 Deg C, the removal can be done gently over a</i><br>
<i>&gt; few hours. The wire array would take little volume, say 1 part per thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the total body volume.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0169qlink8">  Question, if you are assembling the body as a corrected structure at
cryogenic temperatures, what effect will warming the body have on its
structure??? Won't there be some significant problems with coefficients of
expansion going  from 1 degree to 77 degrees??</a> Since you won't have ice
<a name="0169qlink9">crystals, won't the body be severely dehydrated once it is warmed to the 1
degree point????</a> Or will there be transport mechanisms to infuse water as
<a name="0169qlink10">temperature rises?? These will be needed alongside the diamondoid warming
structures, won't they???</a>
