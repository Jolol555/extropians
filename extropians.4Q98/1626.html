<a href="1625.html#1626qlink1">&gt; Is this an innocent case of misattribution or what, Ken. I don't think</a><br>
<i>&gt; either of the above paragraphs were written by Sasha.</i><br>

<p>
Sorry about that, Sasha.  I was just adding to my own rant.  
Actually, I'm not too excited about AOL/Netscape/Sun.  The idea that 
we should all jump up and yell "hooray" because Microsoft get's 
competition on the set-top is absurd!  

<p>
Here's our choice: 

<p>
1.) WinTel/Windows CE/Explorer set top box with ADSL interface 
connected through Baby Bells (MSN subsidiary WebTV portal) 

<p>
2.) WinTel/Windows CE/Explorer set top box with cable modem interface 
connected through AT&amp;T's recently acquired TCI cable infrastructure 
(@Home portal)

<p>
3.) Compaq/Sun JavaSoft/Navigator set top box with ADSL interface 
connected through Baby Bells to (AOL portal).

<p>
4.) Compaq/Sun JavaSoft/Navigator set top box with cable modem 
interface through Cox, Time Warner, or Continental Cable (@Home 
contracted to reroute through AOL or Pathfinder Portal)

<p>
Who wins?:  Baby Bells.  AT&amp;T.  Microsoft.  AOL.  Sun.  Time Warner.

<p>
Who loses:  Everybody else.  Oh, wait.  Deregulation.  That's right.  
We can all go to work for MCI or Sprint's fiber-to-the curb 
initiative.  They'll probably get purchased by AT&amp;T's fiber-to-the 
curb initiative.  At the center of it all: Cisco's NSA switches.

<p>

UNOCAL.  It's still the same old thing.  Petroleum economy slavery.</a>
