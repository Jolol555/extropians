<i>&gt; &gt;Even a machine with just one setting, pleasure, would be</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;one too: now you control your own emotions). The stuff that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;dreamsare made of. Now of course follows the inevitable </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;question: why hasn't this been done yet? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Uh, arn't these called sex toys? :-)  </i><br>

<p>
Nope, this one aimes for the ultimate pleasure spot, the head,
instead of loitering around the pelvic area ;-) Besides, there
are a lot of other possible settings, though "pleasure" would 
no doubt be the most popular one.
 
<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink2">&gt; I've been inventing, developing, prototyping, and testing technosexual</a><br>
<i>&gt; devices for many years now.  I have many extremely unique, but so far</i><br>
<i>&gt; unpatented designs, some of which would cause you to collapse in</i><br>
<i>&gt; laughter upon hearing the details.  I know *I* did when I first</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought up the ideas.  Many of my designs are intended to enhance</i><br>
<i>&gt; partner sex, but training has been most effective with solosexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; activity.  I'll be glad to post descriptions and links to the list as</i><br>
<i>&gt; soon as I have protected my intellectual property.  </i><br>

<p>
Please do, I can't wait to see a real "transhuman" sex toy.

<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink3">&gt; It is a biofeedback technosexual stimulation device designed to teach</a><br>
<i>&gt; the capability of having a long series of intense orgasms (up to 12</i><br>
<i>&gt; hours in some test subjects, chemically aided of course).  </i><br>

<p>
And they survived?

<p>
The
<br>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink4">&gt; stimulation is a complex function of input from a sensor on the PC</a><br>
<i>&gt; muscle. The PC or Pubococcygeus muscle goes around the anus, across</i><br>
<i>&gt; the entire pelvic floor, and attaches in front to the pubic bone on</i><br>
<i>&gt; both women and men.  To locate this muscle, simply stop the flow of</i><br>
<i>&gt; urine. A weak PC muscle will result in urinary incontinence. </i><br>

<p>
I can feel it! (think of the Jackson 5 song "Can you feel it"? when
practicing, it might help).
 
<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink5">&gt; my machine which develops "fast</a><br>
<i>&gt; reflexive" muscles designed for extreme involuntary contractions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the PC muscle.  </i><br>

<p>
So, it's basically one of those things that tone your muscles 
by means of electric stimulation, but now stuck to your ass?
Pretty smooth idea! Why didn't *I* think of that?

<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink6">&gt; I'm not ready to say much more about my devices on the</a><br>
<i>&gt; wider list yet, but hopefully will within the next year.  That is, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; I ultimately decide they are transhuman in nature</i><br>

<p>
Ah, who cares, as long as they *work*! ;-)

<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink7">&gt; The ones with biofeedback from the PC muscle are far too addictive to</a><br>
<i>&gt; make available as a commercial product and not expect legal problems. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, I *will* do it anyway :-).  Coming soon to a net-store near</i><br>
<i>&gt; you.</i><br>

<p>
That's the spirit!
 
<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink8">&gt; &gt; Now, can anyone tell me: why on earth isn't this product on</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the market yet? Are there technical problems, or is everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; just missing a great opportunity here? I mean, one could get</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; richer than Bill Gates by making a product that will virtually sell </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; *itself*, and no doubt will change society quite a bit in the process.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Improper usage can cause injury.  </i><br>

<p>
No doubt. Perhaps surgeons specialized in brain tumors will have
a field day...
 
<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink9">&gt; Improper sharing or cleaning/maintaining can transmit disease or</a><br>
<i>&gt; infection.  </i><br>

<p>
Not with the headset, which I might call "Mr. Feeling" btw.

<p>
<a href="0437.html#0461qlink10">&gt; Mental and possibly physical addiction. </a><br>

<p>
Oh yess! But at least they'll die happier than they've ever been...

The beauty of the mind helmet is that it doesn't require any practice
or special skills whatsoever; just sit back and be pleasured, or whatever.
