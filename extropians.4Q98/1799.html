<p>
My telephone company is USWEST.  Sometimes, my telephone 
conversations make interesting fodder for discussion.

<p>
I hereby grant USWEST and Time-Warner permission to use recordings of 
my telephone calls in behind the scenes discussions, without further 
direct interaction with me.

<p>
Of course, this bring up the whole question of verification.

<p>
<a name="1893qlink1">Having worked at SGI, I know that special effects experts can fake 
almost anything, including surveillance audio and video.</a>

<p>
This might include pairing the sound of Waterford Crystal toasts, 
with statements like "Here's to letting go of the gold standard!".

<p>
Maybe two glasses touched, or maybe it was just a little digital 
compositing by the guys at Dreamworks, SKG!  (Don't call Richard D. 
McCormick, Chariman and Chief Executive Officer of U S WEST, Inc., at 
303-793-6500, because his secretary is extremely busy these days.)

<p>
<a name="1803qlink1"><a name="1802qlink1">When thinking about the resonance decay of Waterford Crystal toasts, 
I can help but ask how long the noise would last if the toast was 
made using goblets made of diamond?</a>  
</a>

<p>
On an unrelated note: those mass produced backyard flywheel arrays 
might not be safe underground in Homer's backyard, given the poor 
drainage and increasing rainfall lately, due to global warming 
(<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD/">http://www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD/</a>).  Time to bring in the containment 
experts over at Tupperware (<a href="http://www.tupperware.com/">http://www.tupperware.com/</a>).  Now I know 
why AT&amp;T, USWEST, TCI, and a lot of other forward thinkers are up 
there in the Rocky Mountains!  Where better to put the 
UPS!? (<a href="http://www.ups.com/">http://www.ups.com/</a> or http://www.minuteman-ups.com/?)

<p>
We're gonna need a UPS to keep those absolutely silent, now you see 
it, now you don't, MEMS-skinned, disc-shaped space ships afloat!  
Wouldn't want to see anyone falling out of the sky on the Seattle to 
Portland shuttle!  See <a href="http://www.sciam.com/0197issue/0197moin.html">http://www.sciam.com/0197issue/0197moin.html</a>.

<p>
Regarding teledesic, maybe we could do a Hubble style retrofit of 
Iridium and create a quantum switched two-way neural telepathy system 
to read the thoughts of the squirrels and chipmunks down on the 
ground.  That would make law enforcement easier, as I try to collect 
taxes from the blue jays building nests in my backyard!

<p>
Just kidding, there's plenty of space in the trees for the birds to 
build nests, and there are lots of pumpkin seeds for the squirrels!


<p>
Is it <a href="http://www.ups.com/">http://www.ups.com/</a>, or
