Yes, Rush is definately high on my list for "Extropian"-like music.  I
would also suggest Tool (alternative heavy metal-esque), Orbital
(seminal electronica), and Orb (electronica).

<a name="2976qlink1">On a related note; comic books.  Have any of you ever read a comic book
series called Mircle Man (previously published as Marvel Man in the UK
several decades ago) published by Eclipse Comics?  The first half of the
series was written by Alan Moore, the second half by Neil Gaiman (writer
of the Sandman comics). Extremely strong extropian themes. Does anyone
have a series that they think fits extropian/transhumanist ideas?
