I am trying to suggest some good book to a 16yo correspondent

<p>
with a religious background who is trying to find interesting ways 

<p>
to look at the world and see what's out there.



<p>
Do you have any suggestions of books that could open somebody's

<p>
mind to the marvels of science, provide interesting new views on

<p>
science, religion, world, and humans, or generally inspire, without

<p>
being too specialized, or difficult?</a>



<p>
What books impressed you most when you were in high school?
<hr>
<br>
The book I wish I'd received when I was that age would have been one that
probably didn't exist then - a book that both explained and celebrated science
and critical thinking  while rationally examining the claims of pseudoscience
and its allies.  The two best books of that  kind that I've read in recent
years have been Carl Sagan's "The Demon Haunted World" and Michael Shermer's
"Why People Believe Weird Things".
