<p>
um, ill take the 100 years in the truck...  {8^D  as it turns out,
i still have the bike and i looooove the truck.  so rude and gnarly!

<p>
but heres a thought for you all: china is in the process of modernizing,
violently.
<br>
they have already announced that they will not utilize expensive western
technology
<br>
for internal combustion pollution control.  their engines will likely be a lot
like the dirty 60s economy cars produced in the u.s.

<p>
so.  considering there are a billllllion of those folks, and they intend to
drive
<br>
eventually, and california is now receiving a measureable amount of pollution
from across the pacific, we are in for some heartache.  we know that
we can crack coal to propane, or generate propane using biomass,
etc, but these clean and green methods are more expensive than the natural
octane now  available just by pumping it outta the ground.  but if we use
enough gas the u.s., burning cleanly and efficiently in our california state
controlled
<br>
(very controlled) engines, then less would be available in the coming decades
for
<br>
the chinese to burn dirty.  then they might decide to go directly to the
cleaner propane burners, without going through dirty gasoline engines.

<p>
therefore, by driving a big rude v8, we not only drive more safely and thereby
increase our chances of surviving until nanotech nerdvana, we also help protect
the environment from the chinese hordes.  {8-]
