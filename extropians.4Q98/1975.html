<a href="1946.html#1975qlink1">&gt; &gt; My mind is just totally boggled by this thread; it's so obviously absurd</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that I can barely imagine anyone on this list actually taking it seriously.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Things have definitely gone downhill since I started reading it four or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; five years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't worry Mark, I stopped taking this thread and Den Otter seriously when he</i><br>
<i>&gt; first jumped in to the Death Penalty debate (see my response to his first</i><br>
<i>&gt; post).  His views are so absurd, I couldn't respond to anything else he said</i><br>
<i>&gt; because my stomach was hurting from laughing too hard.  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="2017qlink1">You're welcome, Paul. However, I must say that your Acid solution was
funnier still..."When logic, and proportion, have fallen sloppy dead..."

<p>
<a name="2003qlink1">Perhaps we could refrain from any further insults</a> and respect 
eachother's good intentions. After all, that's all they will ever be...

<p>
-Peace, brother
