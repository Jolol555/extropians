<a href="1062.html#1096qlink1">&gt;relief sent to Central America has been directly from corporations,</a><br>
<i>&gt;particularly American ones, with business interests in the region.  Not</i><br>
<i>&gt;only that, but that the response from companies was much quicker than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;response from governments.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1131qlink1">That's the key: "business interests in the region"

<p>
Some people forget that (seemingly) altruistic behavior can arise
selfishly. The companies are almost certainly acting in their best
interest. They benefit in two ways. They help to sustain the area where
their economic interests lie and they appear "good" to the consumer. This
should not be underestimated.</a>

<p>
Of course there's your "average" indifferent/uninformed consumer, but any
advantage to be gained from consumers who do not fit this description is a
benefit.

<p>
not the forward-thinking ones.
