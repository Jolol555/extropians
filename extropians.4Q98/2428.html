<p>
I had thought that it was actually 30 meters (100 feet). Its actually rather
easy. you can:


<OL>
  <li>  use an inertial sensor to sense movement to compensate for variances in
the gps computed course to get a true course and position
  <li>  do multiple transmissions from the same position and average them
  <li>  use three or more gps chips to work in parallel to triangulate a more
accurate measurement (useful for positioning on the move).
  <li>  include a fixed ground based transponder in the system to calculate
position. There are many systems currently available which use this method.
Accuracy is supposedly less than 10 feet. A lot of surveying companys use
this equipment.

<i>&gt; starts, we can begin eye-for-an-eye deanimation of the dogs of war?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2462qlink1">Actually, gps makes existing technologies cheaper. The price</a> of the Tomahawk
missile went down from over $1 million to less than $250,000 when the old
inertial sensor/tv-computer mapping system was replaced with a gps guidance
system. Now most of the cost of one of those is just the engine. So we get
smarter battlefield technologies for less money thanks to gps. Also THOR is a
line of sight system is it not? Well, most preferred weapons can kill over
the horizon....
