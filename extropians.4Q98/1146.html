I agree with Aegis.  I have very strong bull detectors, and I didn't hear
anything wrong.<a name="1177qlink1">  I heard someone pointing out the flaw in a commonly-used
analogy.  If the maximum size for assemblers is smaller than the minimum size
for chemically powered cells, the analogy is invalid and that's</a> that.  If it
takes a major research breakthrough to get powered sub-micron units, then
that's one of the many leaps required for nanotechnology.  Nobody said
nanotech was going to be easy.<a name="1176qlink1">  I *pray* nano is hard enough to defeat the
human race until there are competent, ethical transhumans around to handle</a> it.

<p>
I think Whitesides has done a good job of identifying the basic issues which
do not scale down from micron cells to nanometer machines.  One is power -
ATP-based chemical power doesn't scale down to what are essentially autonomous
chemicals; nanotech needs some source of power - electrical, perhaps.  Two is
friction - the macroscopic or classical effects used to shape current
machinery don't operate at the atomic or quantum level; nanotech needs a
different type of design, assembled from atoms instead of carved from blocks. 
Three is manufacturing - how do we make an assembler once we've designed it?

<p>
I believe that all three questions are addressed in Dr. Drexler's
"Nanotechnology".  I would have been interested in a critique of Drexler's
answers, but what Whitesides delivered was a perfectly valid critique of a
common, popularized, mistaken argument.  So I don't think that Whitesides is
being unnecessarily skeptical, but I don't think he's disproved nanotechnology either.
