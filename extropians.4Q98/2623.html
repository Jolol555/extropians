<p>
Yes, I'd go for the crank over crankiness.

<p>
I am amazed when learning of case studies where a person once thought of as
being a genius, later in life is institutionalized as being insane.  Such
as with William Sidis who could read and spell at 2, invented new table of
logarithms at 8, spoke six languages at 10, and at the age of 11 was
enrolled at Harvard and graduated at 16.  Later in his 20s, he became
cranky, obsessive and somewhat autistic in his behavior.</a>

<p>
<a name="2663qlink3">(Recently an article in LA Times re close proximity of genius and insanity
and the romantic notion of same, commented that tormented genius icon van
Gogh was probably *mad* because of an enzyme imbalance.)

<p>
Regarding ups and downs and affability, no matter how bring a person is,
there is little excuse for hostility, rudeness and adolescent behavior
other than a psychological chemical imbalance or the effects of poor or
insufficient training as a child in controlling emotions and outbursts.  We
often excuse a person who is exceptionally bright for being bratty as if in
awe that this person might carry the mad-tormented-genius-gene. How
romantic?  How insufferable.

<p>
There are numerous ways a person (bright or not) can overcome psychological
handicaps, and it is a sure sign of intelligence if a person who suffers
from emotional imbalance recognizes it, and deals</a> with it.
