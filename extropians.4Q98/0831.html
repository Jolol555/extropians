<a name="0844qlink1">When it comes to the price of manufacturing RAM, DSPs, and Flat Panel 
displays, how much of that cost has to do with chip packaging, 
marketing, distribution, etc?</a>

<p>
<a name="0844qlink2">Is there a type of RAM that can be manufactured so that the entire 8" 
or 10" wafer can be used at once?  Is there some type of built in 
logic that can continuously check for bad memory regions, then route 
around them?  Kind of like a Thinking Machine on a wafer?</a>

<p>
<a name="0844qlink3"><a name="0839qlink1">By skipping the ceramic mount portion of the packaging, would it be 
possible to make computer that have all of the ram, parallel DSPs, 
and flat display circuitry combined: all manufactured and assembled 
simultaneously in clean room facilities?</a></a>

<p>
<a name="0844qlink4">For example, see MicroDisplay (<a href="http://www.microdisplay.com/">http://www.microdisplay.com/</a>).  If 
these displays could be made the size of a Mead Notebook, with RAM 
and parallel DSPs all built into the same package, they could replace 
books, with excellent paper-like resolution.

<p>
Adding a flat battery and a radio (like a CDMA PCS cellphone with 
military GPS - see <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/">http://www.qualcomm.com/</a>), with geographically 
variable spectrum allocation, they could be broadband books.
</a>

<p>
We could take the entire budget of the US Department of Education, 
and reallocate it to a manufacturing facility that produces these 
things.  

<p>
<a name="0839qlink2">If we put a MEMS fisheye camera in every pixel, this could also 
double as a vanity mirror.
