<pre>
  &gt;Hmm, but how useful is a 60-mile brain which can only think at the same
  &gt;speed as a human against microscopic posthumans who can think much
  &gt;faster? Or are we assuming they're running at human speeds too?

<a name="0448qlink2"><a name="0435qlink1">First of all I made an error, light moves 3,000,000 times  faster than
the signals in the human brain not 300,000 so the brain could</a> be 600
miles wide not 60. This just means that if a brain were much larger than that
we would probably consider such a thing not a single entity as we consider
ourselves but rather a colony of many very similar closely cooperating
individuals. It's a matter of taste, from some perspectives a human
mind is not just one thing either.

<p>
One thing is objective, such a brain would think 3,000,000 times faster
than we do, more actually because the components in it would be far
smaller than neurons. There is something even more important than speed
however, such a being would think astronomically deeper than we do.</a>
