Would anyone know...if you have an allergy to shellfish...can you take

<BR>Title
<BR>&nbsp; Dietary chitosan inhibits hypercholesterolaemia and
<BR>&nbsp; atherogenesis in the apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse model
of
<BR>&nbsp; atherosclerosis.
<BR>Source
<BR>&nbsp; Atherosclerosis.&nbsp; 138(2):329-34, 1998 Jun.
<BR>Abstract
<BR>&nbsp; Chitosan, the deacetylated form of chitin, is extracted from
<BR>&nbsp; the shells of crustaceans. The strong positive charge carried
by the
<BR>&nbsp; chitosan molecule causes it to bind negatively charged
<BR>&nbsp; substrates such as lipids. Orally administered chitosan
<BR>&nbsp; binds fat in the intestine, blocking absorption, and has been
shown to lower
<BR>&nbsp; blood cholesterol in animals and humans. As a result it has
been proposed
<BR>&nbsp; that dietary supplementation with chitosan may inhibit the
<BR>&nbsp; formation of atherosclerotic plaque. We have tested this hypothesis
using the
<BR>&nbsp; apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse model of atherosclerosis. This
<BR>&nbsp; hypercholesterolaemic animal develops atherosclerosis without
the need for
<BR>&nbsp; dietary or surgical intervention. The apolipoprotein E-deficient
mouse
<BR>&nbsp; therefore provides an ideal model in which to study the effects
of dietary
<BR>&nbsp; chitosan on both blood cholesterol and atherosclerosis.
<BR>&nbsp; Animals were fed for 20 weeks on a diet containing 5%
<BR>&nbsp; chitosan or on a control diet. Blood cholesterol levels were
<BR>&nbsp; significantly lower in the chitosan fed animals throughout
<BR>&nbsp; the study, and at 20 weeks were 64% of control levels. When
the area of
<BR>&nbsp; aortic plaque in the two groups was compared a highly significant
inhibition
<BR>&nbsp; of atherogenesis, in both the whole aorta and the aortic arch,
was observed
<BR>&nbsp; in the chitosan fed animals--42 and 50%, respectively. Body
<BR>&nbsp; growth was significantly greater in the chitosan fed
<BR>&nbsp; animals. This study is the first to show a direct correlation
between
<BR>&nbsp; lowering of serum cholesterol with chitosan and inhibition
<BR>&nbsp; of atherogenesis, and suggests that the agent could be used
to inhibit the
<BR>&nbsp; development of atherosclerosis in individuals with hypercholesterolaemia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
