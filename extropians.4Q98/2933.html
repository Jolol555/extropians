<i>&gt; &gt;I'm extremely curious what [the list] would classify as "Extropian Music".</i><br>

<p>
I think (as others has pointed out) that there is no single extropian
music. We like different styles, some music might use technologies we
ejoy, other music might express our visions and other music is
mind-expanding. But it is hard to call it "extropian music".

<p>
That doesn't mean we shouldn't recommend what we think is good music
to each other, just as we recommend good books or websites. I have got
a lot of great tips from this list.

Unfortunately true. I wonder if we could start collaborating,
combining our respective specialities?

<a href="2917.html#2933qlink3">&gt; I think that Transhumanism is such a complex subject that to know both it</a><br>

<p>
A lot of music has been made just for the fun of it. 

<p>
<a href="2917.html#2933qlink4">&gt; The obvious choice though is Kraftwerk.</a><br>

<p>
Yes!

As always when this thread pops up, I recommend Philip Glass. Two days
ago I bought the soundtrack of Powaqqatsi (sp?). I was feeling a
preliminary cold, so I put on the CD and went to bed, doing a
visualization to get my T-cells up and going while listening. The
first track was happy and energetic, a nice complement. Then the
second track began... a kind of low, background chord that really
fuelled my anticipation. As the music evolved, I began to get a
feeling of familiarity, and as the theme emerged I suddenly realized
that this was the title music from the Truman Show too! I had a flash
of insight, when I correlated a lot of facts I had previously only
noted (like seeing Glass name on some webpage about the movie) and at
the same time getting this wonderful transhuman feeling. After that I
couldn't stay in bed, I jumped up at my computer and began
working... :-)
