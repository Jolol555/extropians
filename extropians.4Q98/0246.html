<a name="0291qlink1"><a name="0270qlink1"><a name="0257qlink1"><a name="0251qlink1">Nick Bostrom suggested that he &amp; I take public our private 
conversation about definitions of transhumanism.  I proposed:

<p>
   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world so much in the next century or two that 
   our descendants will in many ways no longer be "human." 
</a>
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="0270qlink2"><a name="0254qlink1"><a name="0251qlink2">This definition focuses on positive, not normative, beliefs.</a> 
</a>
<a name="0251qlink3">To those who think that a definition should focus on normative
beliefs I ask:<a name="0257qlink2">  Why do there seem to be so few people who share
our positive beliefs but not our normative</a> beliefs?  That is, 
<a name="0278qlink1">where are the people who believe that big technology-induced
change is coming, and think that is a terrible thing?</a>  
</a>
</a>
</a>

<p>
I see three possible explanations:
<br>
<a name="0252qlink1">1) People differ much more on normative than positive beliefs.</a> 
<p>
   So most who accept our positive beliefs naturally accept our 
   normative beliefs.  This suggests the above definition.
2) Those who think big bad change will happen prefer to ignore
<p>
   the future and think mainly about today.  Optimists tend to
   be more vocal.
<br>
<a name="0251qlink4">3) When thinking about the future, most people succumb to wishful
<p>
   thinking, and so choose positive beliefs based on normative ones.
   So those who think big techno-driven change is OK are willing 
   to think it will happen.  And those who think such change is bad
   believe that it isn't likely.</a>  Wishful thinking can be partially
   rationalized by believing that humanity can stop new technologies
   that threaten unwelcome change.
