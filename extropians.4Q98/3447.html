<p>
I read much of Soros's book.
<br>
His analysis of the market seems excellent, while social 
theories seem similar to home-made ideas of some
undergraduate student.  
<br>
Claiming that the system is flawed or being an atheist
do not seem to require much brilliance.  Winning in the
market to _that_ extent, of course, does.  But his
philanthropy, conducted by the highly bureaucratic
organization and linked to his business interests,
<a name="3449qlink1">doesn't seem to offset the destabilizing influence
of his speculative ventures within the "flawed" system,</a>
the net short-term effect of his "brilliant" actions
seems questionable, and the long-term issues that may
be of interest to a normal extropian, he doesn't seem
to understand, let alone lead...
