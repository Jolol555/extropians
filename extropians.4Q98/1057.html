<p>
Ignoring all other factors, your pricing ($2,000/meter) is probably
relatively close based on my personal experience.  Normal soft rock
tunneling can cost as little as $100/meter (at ~5m/hour) but given some of
your parameters, the costs would almost certainly skyrocket based on the
dimensions and extreme length of this tunnel.  Hard rock tunneling will
cost a little more (rates are often based on time, not distance) since it
will take longer to drill through.  I would love to know how you expect to
change drill heads twice a day when the drill is several thousand
kilometers away in a tunnel under the ocean.

<p>
However, the concept is (more or less) an engineering impossibility for a
number of reasons.  Question:  Why don't you just lay the optic fiber
across the ocean bed like everyone else?
