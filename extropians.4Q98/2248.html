<a href="2238.html#2248qlink1">&gt;From: my inner geek &lt;geek@ifeden.com&gt;</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;How do you feel about a genetically engineered labor force?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think genetic engineering will probably happen. I think initially the</i><br>
<i>&gt;impetus of genetic engineering  will center on creating exceptional talent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;high IQ, improved immune systems, increased longevity and the like. All</i><br>
<i>&gt;aimed at the betterment of the whole human race.</i><br>


<p>
Not at the betterment of individuals?  Afterall, at least in the initial
stages, hardly anyone will be able to afford genetic treatment.

<p>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink2">&gt;But then, naturally, the question will arise, "Who will do the dirty work?"</a><br>
<i>&gt;This prompts me to recall Bob Black's book _The Abolition of Work_. Rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;than engineer intellectually challenged workers, I think scientists will</i><br>
<i>&gt;study ways to eliminate the need for labor.</i><br>


<p>
Have been for hundreds of years.  It's made it possible for all sorts of
labour that wiould have been too labour intensive before to occur.  There is
_always_ more to be done.

<p>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink3">&gt;Sincerely, I feel very negative about a genetically engineered *labor</a><br>
<i>&gt;force*. Instead of producing more workers, I think we should eliminate</i><br>
work.
<br>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink4">&gt;If we can't figure out how to eliminate work, then we should genetically</a><br>
<i>&gt;engineer super-intelligent brains to figure it out for us.</i><br>


<p>
What if they don't want to?  We can hardly coerce them, can we?

<p>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink5">&gt;Would these super smarties constitute a labor force? No, no... they'd join</a><br>
<i>&gt;the staff, they'd become part of the faculty, they'd rule rather than</i><br>
labor.


<p>
Aren't you against ruling elites?

<p>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink6">&gt;I don't object at all to genetic engineering, Ken. But I think we ought to</a><br>
<i>&gt;do all we can to eliminate the need for a labor force by eliminating labor.</i><br>


<p>
We have already eliminated large chunks of necessary labour.  Most work
(from what I remember reading) is now done for non-survival ends.  How much
food did _you_ grow this week?

<p>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink7">&gt;With successful genetic engineering the world might raise itself to such a</a><br>
<i>&gt;level that no one would any longer have the stupid desire to govern others.</i><br>


<p>
Except that if offered the choice between engineering their children to be
presidents or engineering their children to be slackers, most parents would
want presidents.

<p>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink8">&gt;So genetic engineering could help to eliminate government as well as labor.</a><br>

<p>
I hope not.

<p>
<a href="2238.html#2248qlink9">&gt;Like the man said, "First kill all the lawyers."</a><br>
<i>&gt;Then I'd feel much better about it, because then genetic engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't fall into the wrong hands, namely government's. If politicians</i><br>
<i>&gt;control the direction of genetic engineering, then we'll have robots coming</i><br>
<i>&gt;out of the labs. If reasonable scientists have control, then we can expect</i><br>
<i>&gt;sanity to reign.</i><br>


<p>
You obviously know more reasonable scientists than I do.  I wouldn't trust
more than 2 of the 50 or so I know to run a piss-up in a brewery.
