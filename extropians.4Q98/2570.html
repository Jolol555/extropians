<i>&gt; &gt;Scientific view: 'Property' is just a term applied to objects that you do</i><br>

<i>&gt; No word has "intrinsic" meaning; each user of a word assigns it a meaning -</i><br>

<i>&gt; you choose another word for the idea you're referring to above. It's simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; not what the rest of the world means by "property".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think most people understand the idea of property as involving the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to exclusive control over the use or disposition of an item, acquired</i><br>
<i>&gt; either by extracting an unowned resource or by legitimate (i.e. uncoerced)</i><br>
<i>&gt; transfer from someone who previously owned it. It's not just a desire to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep someone from taking something.</i><br>

I think that his main objection is that he has none.</a>
