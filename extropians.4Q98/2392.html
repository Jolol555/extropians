Well, I'm all for optimism, but the results aren't *that* good.  The 
main cause for improving life expectancies is improving rates of 
cardiovascular disease in middle age (which, interestingly, hasn't yet
been explained).  Late life expectancies are going up, but much more slowly.
Last I checked, life expectancy at 65 was only going up 0.1 year/year.
Current trends will get you to around 80-85 but we're going to need
something else to get much beyond that.

P.S.  I haven't seen the details for this year, but we may be seeing an
effect from the AIDS drugs. AIDS has become a measurable drag on life
expectancy, because its victims are so young, and the protease inhibitors
have had a phenomenal effect, dropping mortality over 50%.  They went
into wide use over the last two years.
