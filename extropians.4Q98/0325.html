<p>
joe you made some interesting comments about engines of creation.
i had an insight about that as i realize that those experiences in life
that hit us really hard are those experiences which we remember with
intricate detail.  thought experiment:  what were you doing the morning
you
<br>
heard that the challenger had exploded?  bet you can write pages.
ok, what were you doing the day before that?  ya dont know, do you?
the week before?  month?  nothing there, is there?

<p>
most of us have events in our lives like that one, that really hit us.
in 1989 i was in a bookstore, books ink, in san jose, scanning over the
science section when i saw a copy of engines of creation.  thinking it
was yet another treatise on creationism (k eric may have chosen an
unfortunate title) i took it down to put where it belonged but then i
started
<br>
reading.  approximately 3 hours later i realized i had read most of that
book standing there in the bookstore.  my legs ached from standing.
i recall intricate details of that morning in the bookstore, but i havent
a clue what else i did that month.  the mind is a curious computer, is it
not?
