Abstract

<OL>
  <li>  Dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) suppressed the age-dependent increase
  in systolic blood pressure and prolonged the average survival time of
  stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). 2.
  Dietary DHA (1% and 5% in diets) altered the circadian rhythm of
  SHRSP, causing significant increases in ambulatory activity
  during the dark period. At the onset of stroke, desynchronization with light
  and dark phases and new biological rhythms were noted in all of the control
  SHRSP (DHA 0%). DHA treated SHRSP did not
  show such behavioral changes. 3. These effects were accompanied by the
  increase of DHA and the decrease of AA levels in plasma and brain cortex. 4.
  It was concluded that dietary DHA suppresses the development of hypertension
  and stroke-related behavioral changes, resulting in prolongation of the
  SHRSP's life span.
