<a name="3711qlink1">I'm afraid this dating service will consist of a couple
of dozen straight extropian men. (See recurrent threads
<br>
"why there are no extropian women") in the list archives.<br>

<p>
However, a "meaningful dating service" where people would
list, besides flesh characteristics, and such interests
as "fun" and "sports", something more interesting and specific,
may be a good idea.  I even entertained for awhile the idea
of a "universal matchmaker" that would include finding not
only relationship partners, but people with whom you can
carpool, play tennis, hike, share an apartment or a cruise
cabin, start a business or an interest group.

<p>
One solution for this would be a database with a Web front end.

<p>
Another - better, in my opinion - is an open XML standard for
representing personal profiles (that can be published anywhere
on the Web), and extendable semantic search engine and matchmaker.

<p>
I think the same approach should give birth to many</a> other
<br>
"semantic search and match" functions, so whoever starts it may<br>
gain much more than a date. 

<p>
I would be happy to join a working group on such a project.
