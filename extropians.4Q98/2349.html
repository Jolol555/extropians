As a kid I read a lot of SF, often averaging 4-5 hours/day (while
being a fast reader). Towards the end, I did it deliberately, as I
intuitively felt it to be some kind of mental calisthenics, a valuable
end in itself, if no other application could be found. Out of
curiousity, how many of you have not been readers of SF or fantasy
either during your childhood/late teenage? [No, I won't sum it up,
ask somebody else]

Why worrying? With a sufficiently advanced technology, human
population can be first dwarfed, then superseded as both an economical
source and sink. You don't have to grok a concept to be obsoletified by it.
