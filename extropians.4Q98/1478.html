<a name="1482qlink1">I've got three kids, one 5 years old, one 20 months old, and one 6</a> weeks old
<a name="1482qlink2">(sleep is a commodity).  Nathan, my 5 year old son, started attending a
private school this year.  Each student in his class had to present a "Me
Board" which included information about the student's family, interests,</a> and
<a name="1482qlink3">future plans.  My wife and I constantly discuss topics related to
transhumanism in front of the children.  In addition, we've got books
scattered all about the house. Nathan periodically picks up a book that has
a visually interesting cover and asks what its about.  I try to give him an
adequate summary of the books ideas.  Anyway, he and I were putting his "Me
Board" together and I asked him about his future plans.  One of his future
plans was to be immortal.  One of his other future plans was to be uploaded
into our computer at home so that he could think faster about what other
future plans he might have.  Unfortunately, I was out of town the day he
presented his "Me Board" so I was not able to see the reaction of his
classmates and teacher at his pronouncements.</a>
