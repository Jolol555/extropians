I don't think so. Having taken numerous IQ tests, which can depend on
mathematical knowledge or not, IQ tests can be tailored to someone with
absolutely no schooling at all (indeed, they have been used on dolphins, monkeys
and dogs), so I don't think you can teach someone to do well on any IQ test. I
do think that the shift in the schools from rote memorization to problem solving
may have some bearing on the shift in IQ, as I tested at 128 IQ in kindergarten,
but am now around 160. If  the Flynn effect is exhibited in kindergarten age
children I don't think that education has anything to do with it. If the effect
is smaller than a high school graduate, then it may have an influence, but not
the whole ball of wax.
