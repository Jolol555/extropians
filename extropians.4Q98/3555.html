Yeah, just read another article that the Russian Rocket forces have brought on line their
first new missile in 20 years. Its a single warhead missile apparently like our own
unrealized "Midgetman", which is not limited by the START treaties (it only limits or bans
multiple warhead missiles). Funny though, they tested 8 of them, and only the last one had a
successful test flight, so they declared it online.... he he ...

<p>
Tritium isn't so bad, there's plenty of it around in our nation's nuke reactors, but there
is no widely used system to filter and collect it. Originally this was purposeful to prevent
knowledge of and access to the technology from spreading from Energy Dept reactors to the
private sector, but now that so many Energy Dept reactors have been shut down, its become
difficult to get. Privatization anyone?
