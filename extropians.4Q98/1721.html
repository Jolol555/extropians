I'm just finishing this book, Virginia Postrel's  "The Future and Its Enemies:
The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise and Progress".  I've had the
good fortune to meet Virginia a couple of times, most recently last weekend at
Cato's conference on Technology and Society, and her book reflects the
intelligence, humor and charisma she evidences as a speaker.  I highly
recommend this book, a taste of which you can get at the web site she's
created to promote it:

    <a href="http://www.dynamist.com">http://www.dynamist.com</a>

<p>
Her book expresses my own political and social ideas and values in the context
of current events and issues better than the work of any other writer I've
encountered.  As Fred Moulton pointed out in his post, the basic ideas in her
book will be familiar to the subscribers to this list.  But this book is a
worthy addition to your library, if for no other reason than so that you can
recommend it to your friends and associates.  "The Future and Its Enemies"
will do a very good job of spreading the values of spontaneous order to a
wider audience.
