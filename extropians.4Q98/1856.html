Absolutely.  China has been engaged in for-profit organ harvesting of executed
prisoners for at least the past 20 years.  Not only are these prisoners executed in
public stadiums, but their organs are harvested immediately afterwards and sold to
the highest bidder.  The Chinese government, inept in obtaining money</a> by any
<a name="2639qlink3">legitimate economic means, resorts to the most arbitrary definition of what a
"criminal" is, that it can essentially arrest anyone at anytime for any reason.
Motivate arbitrary arrest with a profit motive, and you have one</a> of the most cruel
<a name="2639qlink4">and tyrannical governments on the planet.
