<a name="0806qlink1"><a name="0786qlink1">I assume that many of you are aware of the situation in Afghanistan by 
now.  An excellent set of factual material and suggestions for action 
can be found at <a href="http://www.feminist.org/afghan/intro.html">http://www.feminist.org/afghan/intro.html</a>.

 Kudos to Ellie Smeal and the FFM for mounting a clear, rational and strong 
campaign.  In media interviews, Ms. Smeal has based her comments on the 
scientific basis for opposing house arrest for women--the severe health 
consequences brought about by a lack of sunshine and access to medical care.

<a name="0811qlink1">I hope that transhumanists, individually or in their groups, will 
decide to take some sort of action or make some sort of statement that 
indicates that we do not tolerate this sort of retrograde human abuse.  
If the situation is not reversed in Afghanistan, we will be living in a 
time in which at least one nation on the globe has free rein to 
segregate and punish its citizens based on their biology.
