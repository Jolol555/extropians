<a href="2947.html#2958qlink1">&gt;Samael polls the netizenry:</a><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Further to conversations in this newsgroup regarding how corporations would</i><br>
<i>&gt;not be able to do what they liked, I'd be interested in how many people are</i><br>
<i>&gt;boycotting corporations for ethical reasons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For instance, Nestle (producers of vast amounts of chocolate and Nescafe</i><br>
<i>&gt;Coffee) are boycotted by some people because they use policies in the third</i><br>
<i>&gt;world which cause the deaths of thousands of babies a year.  Do any of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarians on this list boycott them?  Or anyone else?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, if I were convinced of the above claim, I would boycott Nestle. But I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't rely on the popular media for real information. Where do you come by</i><br>
<i>&gt;your opinion on this?</i><br>


<p>
Aid workers working out there, the various different groups organising
boycotts against nestle (as of a few years ago, anyway).
Haven't seen anything in the popular media about this at all.

<p>
<a name="2992qlink1">Nestle offer free milk products to new mothers, they use these</a> (not thinking
<a name="2992qlink2">it through/knowing enough), tye then produce less milk (the mothers body
automatically adjusts to produce less milk if it's not needed).  They then
can't afford to carry on with the products and most ofthem have no</a> access to
<a name="2992qlink3">fresh water anyway, so theycan't produce the milk for their</a> children either
naturally or unnaturally.

<p>
All of this is of course subject to the usual FUD - especially as I haven't
seen anything on this recently.  If anyone has up to date info on this I
would be glad to hear about it.

either way)
