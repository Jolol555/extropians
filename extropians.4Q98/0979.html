  I know this effect is observed in the laboratory and I had not really
  asked
<br>
  why, but here goes my best guess. Any crystal is a highly organized
  structure which is made up of smaller repeating units.  The process is
one
<br>
  in which small units form first and then are gathered into a larger
  structure.  By quick freezing an object you may be able to slow molecules
  down before they are able to become highly organized. (The slower you
cool
<br>
  any crystal the more perfect its structure) It is large crystals which
are
<br>
  problems for cells.<a name="0987qlink1">  They do nasty things like tearing cell membranes. 
If
<br>
  you freeze an object very quickly the crystals are probably kept in a
less
<br>
  organized state and of a diameter which is not particularly dangerous</a> to
  cells.
<br>
  I hope that helped.  Peter
