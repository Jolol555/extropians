<a name="2675qlink1"><i>&gt;From what I have read on this list on this topic,</a> (and compiled below) it</i><br>
<a name="2675qlink2">seems that the points brought up about education in this thread are:


<OL>
  <li>  Free education at a basic level.
  <li>  Teaching of logic and thinking skills
</a>
  <li>  Private schools providing a "free market" competitiveness between
schools
<a name="2675qlink3">  <li>  Nothing of everyday application learnt in school.
  <li>  Poor people not getting an education
  <li>  Inadequate advancement of brighter students
  <li>  School placing too much emphasis on developing socialization skills
<a name="2675qlink4">  <li>  Same age =&gt; same education
</a>
  <li>  Education leads to raised output and higher GNP.


</a>
</OL>
<p>
A suggestion to compiling all of this into a workable and usable education
<a name="2675qlink5">philosophy would be schools that are free at a primary level</a> to everybody
<a name="2675qlink6">regardless of social standing. This would hopefully 'help'</a> the poorer people
<a name="2675qlink7">to get a better life by being educated, rather than leave</a> them absolutely no
<a name="2675qlink8">chance to get out of their situation. It would help if this primary
education would be compulsory. This would definitely help</a> in a country's
literacy rate.

<p>
At this level, all children will be thought logic and thinking skills and
philosophy (metaphysics). These topics are meant to introduce a higher mode
of thinking and imagination that current education cannot provide. Other
subjects could include Literature (the classics) and History. Another
subject could be one which would teach them about the 'real' world, the
world they will be growing up in. I don't know how to describe it properly,
but as Mark mentioned, 'something that could be useful in everyday life'.
Also included would be all the prerequisite maths and science and art (but
at a rudimentary level to serve as a starting off point).

<p>
Perhaps at this lower level we can teach children how to open their minds to
more extropian memes, and rather than indoctrinate them with religious
ideas, we could teach them to use their own discretion to form their own
conclusions from what they see around them. This would definitely be a more
extropian educational philosophy!

<p>
The whole curriculum could be structured modularly, so that students could
take their time to complete the modules rather than have to do a set amount
every year before they can move up with their class. A modular curriculum
would remove the 'class' idea in education so that your age does not figure
at all in the education formula. Teachers should be encouraging to slower
students and instead of scolding and pushing the student to complete his
work, they can give the student the option of doing less subjects per
semester, or repeating a module, or taking a longer time for the module.
Without the 'class' idea, the student doesn't have the stigma of being slow
and being 'behind his class'. This would also help with students who have
outside commitments like important sports competitions or working to support
the family....... it would enable the student to concentrate on his
commitments while still completing his education, albeit at his own pace.

<p>
At a higher level, after students have passed a 'graduating' examination, he
can then move on to a higher level of learning, where using what he has
learnt previously, chooses what he wants to do and in whatever combination.
Current education systems have the fault of being to rigid in that you can
only do this if you've already done that, or you can only do this with that
and not that other subject. Similiarly to the primary level, the subjects
are contained in modular form, with a semester length of six months. The
students could take on subjects which interest him and could also have
incredible diversity, like doing an engineering subject with art or
philosophy. Teachers would serve a mentoring purpose, giving the students
appropriate suggestions. The whole point being that the student chooses his
own direction in life.

<p>
The student would thus move on through the modules, doing what interested
him most, and the modules done beforehand would open up other modules so on
and so forth, so that in a short time, he would not only have selected his
career, but his own field of specialization as well! Of course at this
level, the modules would cost a fee to be taught, depending on the
complexity and work needed. This would prevent people from studying free for
their whole lives. With the option to drop a chosen course of modules, the
student would have the financial burden of starting over again as a
deterrent. Again this would be a test of maturity and as long as he's
paying, why stop him, right?

<p>
This form of education would place no importance on age, apart from the age
from which all children should be enrolled into these schools. Could be as
early as four or as late as six. The social aspect of growing up would still
be there, as the schools could be co-ed. Time spent in the schools would
vary according to the subjects taken, although at first perhaps the parents
should have some say.

<p>
A problem that could arise would be the lack of teachers, however, the only
the primary level would be more teacher intensive, and at higher levels, it
could be a lecture system where the lecture hall could contain a hundred or
so students. This would place extra emphasis on doing personal study and
consultation periods could be arranged for students to discuss and debate
certain topics with their lecturers.

<p>
As an aside, teachers of higher levels could be researchers engaged in
school sponsored projects and at higher levels of specialization, students
could work hand in hand with the lecturer as a part of the research team, so
that instead of being in a classroom teaching topics from a textbook,
students could be part an actual research team, and actually learn hands on.
The lecturer would then grade them on their ability in the laboratory, and
provide them the option of staying on and completing the research work to
earn experience.

<p>
I know the above system sounds a lot like a university, but when implemented
on all levels of education, with greater choices on subjects, perhaps we
could actually get somewhere. Objections, suggestions??

<a href="2174.html#2603qlink2">&gt;How did education exist in this country before the early 1900's?  It</a><br>
<i>&gt;was pretty much all private education.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A private education system would work pretty much the same way</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything else "works" in a free market economy.  Freed of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;obnoxious tax burden (theft) currently required for government</i><br>
<i>&gt;"schools," parents would be able to choose which school to send their</i><br>
<i>&gt;children to.  Private for-profit schools would be forced to compete</i><br>
<i>&gt;with one another to provide the best possible education.  Those</i><br>
<i>&gt;schools with the best sucesses (% of graduates enrolled in college,</i><br>
<i>&gt;scholarships given, etc...) would advertise those benifits.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Schools would exist to service "poor" families (even "poor" people in</i><br>
<i>&gt;this country have money to spend) and the poorest families would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;to depend on charity.  Surely the education they would receive</i><br>
<i>&gt;couldn't be worse than what they have now (violent schools, social</i><br>
<i>&gt;promotion, etc.) - if you even want to call it education.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The main reason this would work is because we would have true</i><br>
<i>&gt;competition amongst the various schools.  Teachers and administrators</i><br>
<i>&gt;could be held accountable for students progress and achievements.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since parents would no longer have tax money stolen from them, private</i><br>
<i>&gt;schools would be affordable (the average spending per student is</i><br>
<i>&gt;usually much higher in public schools than private schools because of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the obnoxious administration).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Remember, the free market ALWAYS provides better solutions to problems</i><br>
<i>&gt;than the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>




<p>
<a href="2217.html#2603qlink3">&gt; &gt;Back on the education front, I think at least half the problem is with</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the modern idea of "an education" that lasts a few years early in life</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and that's that. Almost nothing I need to know on an everyday basis</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;even existed when I was at school, and almost nothing I learnt at school</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is at all useful to me. The time I spent there was almost entirely</i><br>
wasted,
<br>
<a href="2217.html#2603qlink4">&gt; &gt;and cost the tax-payers of the time a huge amount of money. It's not just</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;education funding that we have to change, it's the entire educational</i><br>

I agree that people should pay for their mistakes, but nearly everyone
believes that children aren;t responsible.  Forcing them to miss school
because their parents don't have the money to send them there is the worst
kind of stupidity and maliciousness.

<p>
The problem as I see it is that teachers are to reticent to hold poor
students
<br>
back, and far far too reticent to advance smart students forward ahead of
schedule. As are parents. We are far too concerned about developing the
social
<br>
skills of students than about what they are actually learning in classes.
Kids
<br>
have no real need to know the people they are in primary and secondary
school
<br>
with that well. Most of the kids I went to school with at that age I have
not
<br>
seen in ten years, nor would I care to see most of them.

I'd have to agree, in fact most people don't even have the language to
discuss/conceptualize &gt;H memes. I've found over and over that trying to
explain a foreign concept to someone meets with a great deal of resistance.
People, in general, seem to feel (or at least act) as though you're either
spoofing them or putting them down when you talk about things that they've
never been exposed to.

My preferred method of socialism would be to provide free Gealth Care (of a
standard necessary to get people back to work) and enough of a handout to
allow people to survive.  This handout should _not_ be means tested (if it
drops as they start earning here is less incentive to start earning).  Free
Education will also be provided (education leads to raised output and higher
GNP's as well as lowering reproduction), but not in the current form - as
has been pointed out most current education sucks.

<p>
I look forward to hearing objections.
