<a name="1159qlink1">I sent this to the letters page of the Chicago SunTimes Yesterday
in response to the headline story of the Mayor filing suit against
suburban gun shops and gun manufacturers.

<p>
In light of the blantant antigun censorship of the SunTimes, I do
not expect it to be published.


<p>
The Mayor is missing the answer to the gun violence problem in
Chicago.

<p>
Handgun registration in Chicago was terminated in 1983, and it is
illegal to possess an unregistered handgun, so effectively handguns
have been banned in Chicago since 1983.

<p>
Yet despite this and the over 20,000 other gun laws in this country
we see crimes committed daily with illegal handguns, and children
injured and killed because irresponsible adults have left illegal
handguns where they could be found and abused. They are rarely
</a>
punished, I believe they should be.

<p>
<a name="1159qlink2">The answer is personal responsibility. To solve the problem pass
the following law:

<p>
5 years in prison with no chance of parole for possession of an
unregistered/illegal handgun.

<p>
20 years in prison with no chance of parole for the possession of
a handgun during the committing of a crime.

<p>
Life in prison with no chance of parole if during the committing of
a crime with a handgun anyone is injured or killed.

<p>
Pass the law, enforce the law......</a>
