<i>&gt;&gt;No problem. They only get the money if they suspend you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Check out their contracts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't recall seeing such a provision in the contract I signed. Think</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the risks they could face if they make a good faith effort to freeze</i><br>
<i>&gt;you under conditions where it isn't clear whether there is anything left</i><br>
<i>&gt;of your mind, and then some lawyers try to second guess what they</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplished. They really need to know when they start trying to freeze</i><br>
<i>&gt;you whether they will get paid, and there's no good alternative to trusting</i><br>
<i>&gt;them not to take the money when there's clearly nothing to do. They face</i><br>
<i>&gt;significant risks if people suspect they are acting out of greed (at</i><br>
<i>&gt;least as long as there are alledged experts who claim it can't work, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;need to be very carefull to avoid anything that could be confused with</i><br>
<i>&gt;fraud), so a moderate amount of independant scrutiny of their behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt;will normally prevent any unethical use of money.</i><br>


<p>
I may well have spoken in haste here, but my remark was based on the
response I received when I posed this question to a staff member at
ALCOR.  He simply said that if ALCOR did not perform the service, a
secondary beneficiary would receive the money instead.

<i>&gt;&gt;didn't actually die.  I'm curious as to whether they'd have a case</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;for demanding their money back when I'm revived!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; For people suspended when there is a near consensus within the legal</i><br>
system
<br>
<a href="2121.html#2123qlink3">&gt;that cryonically suspended people are dead, they won't have much of a case.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Being declared legally dead and abandonded by the medical profession is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;condition on which they agreed to pay the benefit. There's no fraud</i><br>
involved,
<br>
<a href="2121.html#2123qlink4">&gt;and the insurance agent typically understands that payment for suspension</a><br>
is
<br>
<a href="2121.html#2123qlink5">&gt;what is being contracted for.</a><br>
<i>&gt; Suspension more closely approximates what people want life</i><br>
<i>&gt;insurance to help mitigate the harm from than information theoretic death</i><br>
does
<br>
<a href="2121.html#2123qlink6">&gt;(suspension leaves you unable to help your dependents), so I expect strong</a><br>
<i>&gt;market pressure to resolve ambiguities in insurance contracts towards</i><br>
<i>&gt;treating suspension as equivalent to death even when the popular usage of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the word death starts to become uncertain.</i><br>
