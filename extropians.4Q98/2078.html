Mystic mode on. One hour after the Big Bang no purpose intention or meaning
existed anywhere in the universe. Twenty billion years later there has been progress,
now at least there is subjective meaning, but even today most of the universe
has nothing to do with intelligence so objective purpose still has not made an
appearance despite our deepest wishes that it do so. Life is young however
and  often finds a method get it's way eventually. So maybe God doesn't exist, yet.
Mystic mode off.

You forgot an equally likely possibility.
Three: You do believe in God and for that reason he sends you straight
to hell. God likes logical people and he knows he has not provided
mankind with information to prove his existence so belief in Him is illogical.
Only militant atheists go to heaven.
