So what's wrong with bleak?  I _like_ bleak.  Nobody does bleak like a
Countersphexist, and I'm proud of that.  If you choose the right style
of literature it's even a marketable job skill.  You can take Dynamic
Optimism and stuff it into the infinite nothingness that underlies the
maze of sorrows you call life.

<p>
Incidentally, I should note for the benefit of the humor-impaired people
on this list that, no, I am not a nihilist.  I can't imagine how a
Singularitarian could be.  I know exactly why I get up in the morning,
thank you.  Romanticizing meaninglessness is inconsistent, I wear white,
and I don't confuse my neurologically imposed keen with a personal philosophy.

Isn't it amazing how whatever age we happen to be is "grown-up"?  My
parents invest a great deal of emotion in the fact that THEY are now
adults.  My grandparents disagree, of course; only they are really old. 
Sadly all my great-grandparents passed away a few years ago, but I
assume they suffered from the same delusion.  My fellow teenagers are
all ready to do whatever the hell they feel like and my little sister is
a big girl now.  If we could understand an infant's gurgles, they would
translate to "I'm not an embryo any more and I can spit up on whatever I please."
