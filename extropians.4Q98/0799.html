Why would it keep going faster and faster? It would only accelerate if a
constant force was applied. If you set it in motion at 100 miles per hour,
it would keep going through A and out B, back into A, over and over, at 100
miles per hour and never gaining speed. Unless you mean the gravity of the
wormhole is applying the constant force to keep it accelerating, but this
isn't a problem either. The sun applies a constant force to Earth to keep it
rotating. Or maybe if the wormholes were too far apart, the ball would be
sucked into wormhole A, spat out B, and go slower and slower as it traveled
away from B (being sucked back by B's gravity), until B completely sucked it
back in and spat it out of A, and the same thing happens. The motion would
be a lot like that of a pendulum.
