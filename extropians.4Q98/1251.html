The error in this logic is a) since a transhuman may be equally bigoted against
all mere humans, he is not discriminating, and b) since any mere human can
easily become transhuman in such a society, then the fault for remaining human
is not that of the transhuman. Its easy to be bigoted against ignorant people,
since its so easy to cure that affliction in todays society if only the
ignoramus chooses to open his or her eyes. Refusal to do so is the real sin.
Thats why its ok to be bigoted against bigots... ;)
