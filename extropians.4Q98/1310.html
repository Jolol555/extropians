<a name="1311qlink2">Folklore has it that the Boston Globe was the first to report the
military connection to AIDS, however I think you'd be better asking this
question of a conspiracy list:-</a>

An article appearing in the January 9, 1977 issue of *Newsday* 
describes how operatives having at least tacit CIA approval 
introduced African Swine Fever into Cuba: "A U.S. intelligence 
source told *Newsday* he was given the virus in a sealed, 
unmarked container at a U.S. Army base and CIA training ground in 
the Panama Canal Zone, with instructions to turn it over to [an] 
anti-Castro group."
 
<p>
A Cuban national, on trial in New York Federal District Court, 
testified that in 1980, "as part of a biological warfare scheme 
against the Castro Cuban economy, 'a ship traveled from Florida 
to Cuba with germs...'"

Could ASF be one of the factors behind so-called AIDS? "In 1983, 
two Boston scientists, John Beldekas (Boston University School of 
Medicine) and Jane Teas (Harvard School of Public Health), 
wondered whether ASF was, in fact, the AIDS virus... They found 
evidence that ASF was showing up in the blood of AIDS patients, 
'even though Swine Fever isn't supposed to infect humans,' 
Beldekas comments."
 
<p>
Teas went to Florida. She recalls that while there she "heard 
rumors that some Haitians, after eating pork, were contracting an 
odd illness... Regardless, it was already clear that in some 
areas where you saw a concentration of AIDS (Africa, Brazil, 
Haiti), you saw outbreaks of Swine Fever in herds of pigs. 
Although the pork industry and government scientists won't admit 
it, there are ASF-infected wild pigs in Florida."
