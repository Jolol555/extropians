Last Call For Papers!

<p>
The Philosophy of Transhumanism: A Reader

<p>
Editors: Thom Quinn and Nick Bostrom

<p>
Introduction

<p>
We are currently looking for excellent essays to be published within an
academic volume on the philosophy of transhumanism. This book will be
targeting an audience of scientists, engineers, philosophers, artists
and other well-read professionals. The purpose of this volume is to get
transhumanism recognized as a legitimate philosophy, world-view, and
lifestyle. Essays on all aspects of transhumanism are welcome; however,
only the best essay on any particular topic will be selected for
publication.

<p>
Title

<p>
Since this book is aimed at an academic audience, it does not have a
flashy title. Although this title is not fixed in stone, the book has
been christened The Philosophy of Transhumanism: A Reader. Nick and I
call it "the reader" for short. A straightforward name like this really
is the best strategy for helping people find a book on this novel topic
both in a bookstore and a library.

<p>
Copyright

<p>
Each author will retain the complete copyright to their own essay;
however, if you contribute, you also agree to allow the publication of
your essay in this volume as many times as publishers agree to print it.
There could possibly be various hardcover and softcover editions. If you
were to print your essay elsewhere at a later date, you would cite the
book as the original source, unless it had been published prior to
appearing in this volume. If your essay has been previously published,
then all copyright issues must be worked out ahead of time. 

<p>
Profits

<p>
If the volume makes a profit and we are very certain it will, the total
sum will be evenly distributed among all contributors, including Nick
and myself.

<p>
Deadline: November 1, 1998

<p>
Essays and other materials should be submitted via email; please send
your files either as ASCII text files or MS Word documents. If you live
within the United States, Canada, or Mexico, you should send your
materials to Thom Quinn. If you live in Europe, Asia, Africa, or South
America, please send your materials to Nick Bostrom. The language of
this volume will be English.
