<a href="1511.html#1528qlink1">&gt;It has also been hypothecized that opposed control has survival </a><br>

deperation. how many attacked ancestors survived when one hemisphere was 
disabled by nimbly using the other ;-)

<p>
One idea that sounds reasonable to me is that by crossing the input and 
output, an organism with paired inputs (ears, lateral line sensors) will 
steer towards the signal (moving away increases the ouput of the near 
sensor and so steers back on track). 

<p>
One idea that i had is that all this follows from the fact that the eyes 
_don't_ cross over they just course directly back: left of left eye to 
left hemisphere etc. That has the unfortunate effect of representing the 
right visual field in the left hemisphere: all else follows from this.
