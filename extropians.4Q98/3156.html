What is this in reference to? My description of the theories of people
like McVeigh? I never said I beleived in them, so please keep your rude
insults to yourself. I have served this country faithfully in the
military, and I have marched with lesbians, argued in support of
economic equality for minorities, as well as many other things those
people would find abhorrent. Your rude and unfounded leaping to
conclusions is wholly unwarranted.

<p>
Now, given the theory I posted, can you refute the facts of any of it?
If you can, and convince me, then you've done better than I, because
according to these facts, they are right in this instance, as far as I
can see. The problem with government is there tend to be many 'right'
positions, because government and the law is so convoluted, and its</a> the
one with the biggest guns or the best PR, or the most votes that wins,
which is really the only thing that can nullify an argument like theirs,
which is why it takes events like Ruby Ridge, Waco, and the Montana
Freemen to end such political 'heresies'. Considering that it takes such
violence to resolve these conflicts is a strike against government, not
for it.
