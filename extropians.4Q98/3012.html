<a href="2955.html#3012qlink3">&gt; Now, if you want to talk rampant coercion in modern America, my exhibit A</a><br>
<i>&gt; would be the control businesses have over their employees.  To the average</i><br>
<i>&gt; American, the government is some remote entity with which one interacts on</i><br>
<i>&gt; April 15 and election day.  One's boss, on the other hand, can very quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt; and easily make one's life miserable if one fails to carry out his or her</i><br>
<i>&gt; wishes.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3024qlink15">An employee is not required to work there, nor are they required to do</a> the work.
<a name="3024qlink16">They can very easily change employers, and while employed cannot</a> be coerced into
<a name="3024qlink17">paying for something they don't want, unless you are a union employee,</a> in which
<a name="3024qlink18">case, too bad. I work as a contract consultant. I choose  my employers</a> more than
<a name="3024qlink19">they choose me. And before you think I'm some kind of highly educated
professional, I never finished my bachelors degree, I just know a lot about
computer applications, publishing, graphic design, database conversion, and
website development, as well as a number of other things.</a>

<a href="2955.html#3012qlink4">&gt; To Samael you wrote:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm going to be blunt: please study economics starting at the beginning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm afraid you've missed something important.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3024qlink20"><i>&gt; Without getting into Samael's understanding of economics, even</a> a beginning</i><br>
<a name="3024qlink21"><i>&gt; economist recognizes the important distinction between positive and</i><br>

<a name="3024qlink22"><i>&gt; outcome is Pareto optimal, but another thing entirely to say we should</i><br>
<i>&gt; restructure our political and social systems to achieve said outcome.</i><br>

<p>
Especially when the restructuring would undo 60 years</a> of bureaucrats building
<a name="3024qlink23">the welfare state up, eh? There's a lot of emotional</a> and ideological investment
<a name="3024qlink24">in the status quo. Hopefully the loss of face come jan1 of next year</a> will help
things along.

<a href="2955.html#3012qlink5">&gt; Samael, Joe E. Dees, and others presumably don't disagree with the</a><br>
<i>&gt; underlying economic theory, but do disagree as to how this theory should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; brought to bear to solve social/political/economic problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3024qlink25"><i>&gt; While I don't necessarily agree with everything either Samael or Joe is</i><br>

<a name="3024qlink26"><i>&gt; concerned about what my next (private sector) employer might do to me, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; try to make me do, than I am about the guvmint.</i><br>

<p>
Yes guvmint employees have it pretty cushy, thanks to the union, but</a> how about
<a name="3024qlink27">non-union employees?
