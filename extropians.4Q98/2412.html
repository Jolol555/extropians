My point was that there is no need for anyone to rationally defend
socialism since he already dismisses the whole thing as blatant nonsense.
There is no system which can stand anywhere if you just dismiss its
assumptions without any arguments.

I disagree with claim that most people's needs are greater than their
abilities.  If that would be the case, we would all be dead, unless the
remaining minority's abilities were much, much greater than their needs.
I do agree that most people's wants are much greater than their abilities
Who gets to decide what your abilities and your needs are depends on what
branch of collectivist thought you were bashing just then.

I wasn't claiming that it was a capitalist state, just that it didn't
see itself as having reached communism, only socialism.  Communism, AIUI,
is the final stage where the state withers away (people suitably
brainwashed/advanced by then supposedly)
