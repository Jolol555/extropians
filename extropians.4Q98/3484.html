<a name="3487qlink1">reason i mentioned it:  one security device had me place my hand upon a grid.
it somehow measured the resistance between digits.  they say the resistance
pattern is different for each person, even identical twins, it cannot be fooled
by

any known technology and very seldom fails to correctly identify the person

im with you there.  merry newtonmass!  spike
