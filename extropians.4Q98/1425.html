<p>
I need to clarify my previous note.  I am not a wannabe looking to find
out more about hacking.

<p>
I have been a security consultant for 18+ years, worked for many
government agencies on black projects, incorporated my own security
company in 1995, currently have a contract to provide my security
expertise solely through IBM's I/T Security Consulting Practice, and
have submitted a security invention for possible consideration for a
patent.

<p>
I am a professional Security Consultant who makes money by protecting
large companies and state government agencies from hackers.  (No spooky
stuff, anymore, just business.)  I work one-third of my time out of my
house, and two-thirds of my time flying around the country to customer
sites.

<p>
If there is anybody else out there doing similar stuff, or having
similar interests, I would like to contact you.  I am turning down six
engagements for every one I can fill.  There aren't enough security
consultants to fill the need.  I am not in a position to train anybody,
because I'm too busy.  But if anybody already has expertise in security
or computers, especially if they are intelligent or creative thinkers
like on this list, I would really like to talk to you.
