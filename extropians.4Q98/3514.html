mike i see that this issue is back in the news.  the state department is
scrambling to find a source of tritium.  they are going with tennessee
valley authority, a civilian facility.  tritium has a half life of about 12
yrs if i recall correctly, so it is a big job keeping those cores servicable.
the commies must be having a hell of a time over there keeping
their nukes on line, with all their other problems.  maybe the whole thing
will eventually be too expensive and they will just give up.  peace</a> will
break out all over.  its the end to the cold war everyone hoped
for but no one really expected...  spike {8^D
