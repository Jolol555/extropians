No, but the above implication isn't a very good argument.  I could make
the same argument about sprained ankles:

<p>
For the hundreds of thousands of years our more recent ancestors hunted
and gathered their food without good footwear, how many times each year
did they sprain their ankles?  Now, are you sure that wearing sturdy
footwear for the rest of your life is the right thing to do?

<p>
I'm not saying CR is bad; some of the other data posted to this list
about CR is very interesting.  But the above argument is... less than
compelling.
