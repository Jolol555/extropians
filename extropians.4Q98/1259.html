If this were correct, then any informed person would have to be called a
racist, since the evidence that genetics makes a difference is
overwhelming. I think this shows that what you're saying is not correct.

<p>
In some discussions, I've heard a distinction made between "racialist" and
"racist". A racialist would be one who holds that differences in
intelligence or other abilities correlates significantly with race (however
races are defined in today's age of massive intermixing), but does not
necessarily claim that this justifies different (negative) treatment. But
the term "racist" clearly implies more than a factual observation; it
implies a recommendation to treat some groups worse than others. In this
sense, transhumanism is certainly not inherently racist, nor does it have
any particular tendency to be racist. The many transhumanists I've know
seem to be some of the least racist people (as well as finding variation in
sexual preference to be a trivial matter).

<p>
It seems to me that transhumanists, looking ahead to massive self-redesign,
will have little interest in an individuals racial background or sexual
orientation. That doesn't mean a transhumanist must like all *cultures*
which may be associated with particular races in particular societies.
