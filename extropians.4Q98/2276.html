<a name="2289qlink1"><a name="2286qlink1">I recently finished "The Engines of Creation" and I was thinking about
some of the things that Drexler said.<a name="2402qlink1">  He seemed convinced that
humanity won't find a way to circumvent the speed of light.</a>  One of
<a name="2402qlink2">the things that always bugged me about travelling sub-light speeds was
the incredible time it takes to travel between stars.</a>

<p>
However, if we find a way to indefinitely extend our lifespans this
means we could live a really, really long time.  Further, if we find a
way to make our bodies much less fragile (through uploading or just
reengineering our bodies with nano), then we could potentially live
for millions of years.  

<p>
<a name="2402qlink3">I'm wondering if a human were to have lived a few hundred thousand
years, how much of a pain would it be to travel between the stars at
sub-light speeds.</a>  Would 5 or 10 years or even a thousand even be a
significant amount of time for a being who has lived many many times
</a>that?  

<p>
<a name="2402qlink4"><a name="2286qlink2">In other words, 500,000 years from now when I decide to travel</a> to Star
X which is 1500 light years away, taking me, let's say 3000 years to
get to (conservatively of course), will I bother getting bored?  3000
</a>
years is .06% of 500,000 years.  I'm about 30 years old now and .06%
of my life span is .18 years or a little more than two months -
assuming my math is right</a> - is it?

<p>
<a name="2402qlink5"><a name="2292qlink1"><a name="2286qlink3">My question is, would 3,000 years feel like just a couple of months to
a being more than a half-million years old?  Is there any way to know?</a>  
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="2292qlink2">I get the feeling that as our lifespans begin to get longer and longer
we, as a species, will become more patient and less impulsive.  A
normal human observer looking at a community of long-lived posthumans
might even think they were immobile statues.

<p>
I dunno.

</a><p>
Any ideas, thoughts?  Is this old territory?

<p>
Terry
