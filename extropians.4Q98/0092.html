I would say start looking for another causative agent,</a> unless the cultivation
<a name="0094qlink4">practices in Amsterdam are markedly</a> different from elsewhere. Now, if even a
small but measurable percentage<a name="0094qlink5"> of growers that supply the Amsterdam market
</a>
used things like DDT, etc<a name="0094qlink6"> in cultivating the herb, then there would of course
</a>
be some sort of basis<a name="0094qlink7"> for the claim, but since the number of people using
</a>
herb is consistent<a name="0094qlink8"> with other locations, then I would not expect to see a
</a>
link with herb<a name="0094qlink9"> unless the herb there were different. As for transients,</a> since
throat<a name="0094qlink10"> cancer isn't a condition which just pops up overnight,</a> but requires
<a name="0094qlink11">years of adverse behavior to create, then I would hardly expect</a> to see
<a name="0094qlink12">transients going to Amsterdam, smoking up, and coming</a> down with throat tumors
in the course of a normal vacation.

<p>
<a name="0094qlink13">Now, if Amsterdam had excellent cancer treatment facilities,</a> and low cost
<a name="0094qlink14">health care, most probably socialized, then I would expect</a> to see people move
into the area in order to get quality health care treatment<a name="0094qlink15"> for no cost.
Having an asset like a skill in a special area tends</a> to attract customers for
that service.
