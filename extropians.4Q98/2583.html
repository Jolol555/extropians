There's nothing you could do in case of a worst case event. The only

</a>possible, and hope that the technology is very tightly controlled
during the migration phase. I don't believe in Blue Goo until its
efficaciousness has been shown by modelling (here for once I'm not
clamoring for empirical validation); intuitively due to
situation's assymetry Blue seems to be in an intrinsically weaker
position. Nothing at all can be done against a Blight (hard
Singularity).

After migration is completed, the situation appears containable.
Don't let the interesting times get you before, that's all.
