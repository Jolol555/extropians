Despite all of the flames and hostility,  I've noticed recently that
younger people have been a more active part of this list.  Whether
positively or negatively seems to be irrelevant.  But it has blessed me
with enough courage to post something of my own.

<p>
The question arose in a Physiology of the Cetaceans lecture -- how would
you go about determining the intelligence of a Cetacean?  Which lead us to
the more basic question -- how would you define intelligence.  I offer you
this,  my answer:

<p>
<a name="2711qlink1">Intelligence:  The ability to logically choose between a set of rational
and irrational methods to obtain a goal, project various outcomes, and
proceed in realizing the goal - taking as many of the variable into
consideration as possible.</a>

<p>
Do mind the wording -- my Elementary School fed me the Whole Language
curriculum.  ;]

<p>
However,  I did have to word it so that it would be applicable to species
other than our own...

<p>
Your thoughts?
