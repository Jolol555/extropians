I must be mad, getting into this.  But here's my 2 cents:</a>

<p>
<a name="2013qlink2">If the mind is the brain/body in action, radical indeterminism of the
quantal kind *can't possibly* be the source of `free will'.  We absolutely
do not regard random acts as `free' - in fact, they are as unfree as any
acts done under rigid coercion.</a>

<p>
<a name="2013qlink3">The loop-hole in this argument, as I (dimly) understand it, is the sort of
story told by non-monists such as Popper and Eccles.  If it makes sense to
suppose that minds have (or are) a non-physical or `spiritual'</a> component -
<a name="2013qlink4">whatever that might mean - supervenient upon the hardware of the brain,
then perhaps quantal uncertainties can provide the entrance point to a
neural cascade causing the brain to enter specific states.  Of course, this
just pushes back the issue of `freedom of the will' into a mysterious
impalpable black box,</a> and one for which we have no independent evidence.
<a name="2013qlink5">(But if there is anything to the claims of lab evidence for psi, which I
still find provocative [cf. PEAR, Dean Radin, etc], maybe we will be
obliged to take into account some such mysterioso realm of being and
perhaps consciousness.)</a>
