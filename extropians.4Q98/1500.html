dan, this thought occurred to me after i posted the original comment.
perhaps that is why i thought it curious: our silence on the topic was
deafening.  i said nothing because i have no next generation.

<p>
it did occur to me that extropianism appeals much more to the young.
i verified this on an outing with some extropians, which turned out
to be all young, mostly single, so perhaps most on this list are
pre-reproduction and/or pre-marriage.  (by this comment, i am
*not* asking if anyone here is young and/or single!)  {8^D

<p>
on the topic of chewing up bandwidth, do not worry.  since joining
the list, i have become very quick on the delete trigger, since i
now get a lotta spam.  i became quite the quick draw while the
guns virus plagued this, uh... memeganism.  {8^D  if we label
our offtopics, like you did, i see no reason why extropian parents
shouldnt post comments that are off mainstream.  (by the way, does
it cost extropy.com money post things?  i assumed it
was no cost, but i guess i should have verified this before i
sent some of the goofy stuff i have posted here. )

i hear this a lot.  i guess the silly-clone valley isnt the real world.  {8^D

<p>
i see your point.  other peoples religions have little respect for us,
yet we hafta show respect for them.  {8-[   tyranny of the
