i didnt know this mike.  guess this is what happens to one when one speculates
outside ones area of expertise.  all i need to do now is get one.   {8^D

hmmm.  guess i dont have depression then...  {8^D

<p>
so i guess i better forget my theory that non-depressed northerners went
extinct by causing the igloo to melt in the dead of winter.  {8^D  this is

i have been toying with the idea that humans might be able to evolve
more quickly than other mammals because we enjoy a lower level of
randomness in our mating and reproduction.  has this notion been
explored?  where?  if this idea has any merit, then humans are developing
the ability to evolve ever more quickly as we develop more sophisticated
technology.  i sure hope so.  spike
