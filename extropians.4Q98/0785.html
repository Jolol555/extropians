Yes, since Satan is less powerful than God, it is obvious that Hell is
limited in size. What is its carrying capacity? At what point do souls
have to time share fire and brimstones? Considering that numbers like 666
were considered big and 144,000 was considered to be near infinite, then
Hell must definitely be time-share by now, with billions of souls already
there... Consider also that the number of demons and devils is also
limited to the original amount of fallen angels. The more souls that go to
hell wind up getting tortured less and less over time, unless they wind
up merely torturing themselves...

<a href="0784.html#0785qlink2">&gt; Apparently jokesters are only willing to go so far.  Sadly, $20,000</a><br>
<i>&gt; has not made its way into my account :-( come on td, you elcheapo.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; extend the deadline to the end of this week and reduce the amount to</i><br>
<i>&gt; $10,000.  Because you seem to be a fully badged employee, delivery to</i><br>
<i>&gt; my office in legal tender is acceptable.  Make the envelope somewhat</i><br>
<i>&gt; obscure or I'll never find it in this messy cubicle.  td, you are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bestest.</i><br>

Considering that some on the net think that the EBE's that the Majestic 12
have been consorting with are minions of the devil, you might try to query
Lockheed's Area 51/Groom Lake staff. TD is probably a project head
there....
