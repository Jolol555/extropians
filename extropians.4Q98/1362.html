I do not consider myself a libertarian.

<p>
I used to regard CSICOP as having definitively disproved all claims of psychic
powers.  "Nobody has claimed the $10K" was good enough for me.  Then Dennis
Rawlins, a founding member of CSICOP, accused CSICOP of distorting and
withholding experimental results in "sTARBABY".  I have read Klass's response,
which failed to deny this accusation and focused on ad-hominem attacks. 
CSICOP has lost their objectivity and become an advocacy group.  They are not
searching for the truth; they are promoting a particular set of beliefs, even
in defiance of the facts.  They have become the Committee for Skeptical
Investigation, not the Committee for Scientific Investigation.  One cannot
have both.

<p>
This doesn't mean that I believe in psychic powers.  But I no longer believe
in CSICOP.
