<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
You can only reflect once. After that, the antimatter is gone. This reflection
occured at the moment of the big bang. That antimatter all went backward in time
from the point of the big bang, and we all went forward...Reflect more than once
and you are violating conservation.

<p>
<a name="2229qlink7">No, it comes down to the concept that best fits the facts as they</a> are, not as we
