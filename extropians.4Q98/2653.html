<a name="2744qlink1"><a href="2611.html#2653qlink1">&gt; Personally I disagree with the view that more intelligen people have</a><br>
<i>&gt; higher ups and downs - it smacks of the romantic notion of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tormented genius. Psychological studies seem to suggest that gifted</i><br>
<i>&gt; people tends to be more social and have fewer psychological problems</i><br>
<i>&gt; than normal people.</i><br>

<p>
It smacks to you of the notion of the tormented genius. But just because someone experiences higher highs and lower lows,
doesn't means that they are in a wildly vacillating mental state.</a>

<p>
<a name="2744qlink2">Being able to achieve higher highs, also means being more able to enjoy simple things, such as watching a sunset or
listening to a beautiful melody.  Whereas an average person would need to do something more drastic to experience a high.</a>

<p>
<a name="2744qlink3">Being able to experience lower lows, also means that you learn from negative experiences, and you therefore are able to
avoid them in the future.</a>

<p>
<a name="2744qlink4">Unimpaired ability to experience emotions is GOOD.
