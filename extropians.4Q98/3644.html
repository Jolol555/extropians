For me it's not the actual sex, it's the time component. I tend to invest
large amounts of time in the person I'm dating, reducing my creativity.
I am finding myself much more creative now that I am single than I was a few
months ago. I have more free time to persue intellectual interests as well
as more free brain cycles not taken up with concerns for the other
person that I can use to organize my thoughts. 

<p>
Perhaps my problem is that I have not found anyone who _truely_ inspires me.

<p>
But I have had no luck finding someone of the opposite sex with similar
interests/memeset. Perhaps someone should start up an extropian dating
service</a> ;)
