<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you think it's principled, then proceed to defend the principle.</i><br>

<p>
I didn't claim it was a defended principle (whatever that means),
just a principle.

<p>
<a href="3428.html#3461qlink2">&gt;&gt;If my liberty was reduced, that should show itself in lots of simple</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;familiar consequences.  I wouldn't get to eat the things I like,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;live in the places I like, etc.  I could be displeased by that outcome</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;even without adding on an extra "and my liberty was reduced."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who said it was offered *in addition* to the simple consequences? It's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;a summary, in lieu of enumerating all the detailed losses.</i><br>

<p>
In that case, I prefer to stick to other less emotionally-laden
summaries of consequences.

<p>
<a href="3428.html#3461qlink3">&gt;Tell me, does _The Prince_ really inspire your sense of justice?</a><br>

<p>
No.  But it doesn't offend it either.

<p>
<a href="3428.html#3461qlink4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I accept these features because simple consequential analysis seems</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;our best chance for creating broad intellectual consensus on policy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;If by an appeal to their material advantage we can persuade the less</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;principled to support freedom, that's better than nothing, I suppose.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;There are lots more simple consequences than "material advantage."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;There's having friends, enjoying conversations, liking music,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;traveling to interesting places, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What do these things have to do with market analysis or with Coase's</i><br>
<i>&gt;theorem?</i><br>

<p>
I was objecting to your appearing to reduce "consequential analysis"
to just consideration of  "material advantage."

<p>
<a href="3428.html#3461qlink5">&gt;&gt;&gt;IOW you prefer the _status quo_ of opportunistic power struggles to a</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;principled discussion of the ethical foundations of a good society.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Again, power struggles *are* "principled."  And there is no real</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;alternative to participating in them -- "ethical" discussions are just</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;one of many ways to play the power struggle game.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're equivocating on the word "power" - a common practice among people</i><br>
<i>&gt;who - to their credit - don't want to admit to themselves the brute nature</i><br>
<i>&gt;of what they advocate. Obviously I was addressing the power of compulsion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not "personal power" or "economic power". What sort of "principle" can</i><br>
<i>&gt;justify social order by armed force? "Might makes right"?</i><br>

<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by "justify," and I don't have time now to
explore that with you.

<p>
I'll be on travel for the next two weeks.
Happy Holidays everyone!
