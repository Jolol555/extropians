<i>&gt;So what does socialism mean? And is it compatible with </i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarian ideals? Webster's New International Dictionary </i><br>
<i>&gt;defines a libertarian as "One who holds to the doctrine </i><br>
<i>&gt;of free will; also, one who upholds the principles of </i><br>
<i>&gt;liberty, esp. individual liberty of thought and action." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;According to the American Heritage Dictionary "socialism" </i><br>
<i>&gt;is "a social system in which the producers possess both </i><br>
<i>&gt;political power and the means of producing and distributing </i><br>
<i>&gt;goods." This definition fits neatly with the implications </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the word "libertarian" indicated above. In fact, it </i><br>
<i>&gt;shows that socialism is necessarily libertarian, not statist.</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: The definition of socialism cited observes 
  by default that consumers have been deprived of 
  political power -- which is held by producers --
  and that consumers have been taken out of the control
   of the distribution of goods; which is exactly 
  the case in the socialist, but not libertarian, state.

<p>
  We can also observe that a definition of libertarianism
  need only note that * individuals * have political power,
  not that one social subset, such as producers, had power.
  What is more, the idea that producers have power in the
  socialist state is false, the central planners have it.

<p>
  The case presented for the nondifference of socialism 
  and libertarianism has not been made by the selective 
  set of definitions cited. Here's a better definition
  that clearly defines what is unique to socialism:

<p>
 From Merriam Webster's (<a href="http://m-w.com">http://m-w.com</a>)

<p>
  SOCIALISM: 1: any of various economic and political 
  theories advocating collective or governmental ownership 
  and administration of the means of production and 
  distribution of goods 2 a: a system of society or group 
  living in which there is no private property b: a system 
  or condition of society in which the means of production 
  are owned and controlled by the state 3: a stage of society 
  in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and 
  communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of
  goods and pay according to work done

 opponents and making them see the light, but rather because
  its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows 
   up that is familiar with the idea from the beginning."
