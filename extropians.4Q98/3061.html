The internet is large enough that we could, if we chose, use it as a 
global inventory control system and surveillance network.

<p>
It's technically possible to create a database of today's consumer 
price index, and to *privately* regulate prices within a variable 
range, within limits, so as not to cause economic chaos.

<p>
This would then permit extropians to live on an allowance of 
Gutenberg printed money.

<p>
We would be a new layer in the intelligence community.  Watched, but 
free to communicate openly, and live comfortably.

<p>
However, we would need to develop a filtering system that protected 
us from religious fundamentalists and intolerant thinkers.

<p>
For example, I have updated my home page at <a href="http://define.com">http://define.com</a> to 
include a Linux icon that contains my version of a skunkweed pro-hemp 
emblem.  However, this symbol would likely cause alarm or agitation 
if viewed by certain non-libertarians.

<p>
There are two icons with similar names, but only one is displayed.

<p>

<p>
I'm sure that it is possible to intercept http traffic to and from my 
ISP, so that certain requestors see one version of the bitmap, and 
certain requestors see another version of the bitmap.

<p>
I do not have the database to determine who should see which version.

<p>
However, I believe that the intelligence community and large phone 
companies probably have memeset databases accurate enough to 
determine who would see which image.

<p>
This brings us to the question of verification and authentication.

<p>
For example, last night on CNN I saw video of UN weapons inspectors 
leaving Baghdad.  What is the possibility that this footage was shot 
four days ago, and that three days ago a dense array of neutron bombs 
was detonated over Baghdad?  How do I know that the information I'm 
receiving is current and accurate?  How do I authenticate the news?

<p>
What if there was a PC hardware component list of optimal components 
that could be used to build a PC workstation for use either as a 
Windows95 game machine, Windows98 home office system, WindowsNT 
office workstation, or Linux Workstation/Server?

<p>
What if the system was assembled in each OS configuration, loaded 
with a full suite of software (WP, Database, Spreadsheet, Internet 
Clients, Servers, Games), then cloned using Powerquest Drive Image 
(<a href="http://www.powerquest.com">http://www.powerquest.com</a>) or Norton Ghost (http://www.ghost.com)?

<p>
I would have made an example of that hardware list, but others can 
come up with that.

<p>
<a name="3077qlink1">If the list included links to "this week's" lowest priced wholesale 
component vendors, than this would create a resource for bypassing 
retail and mail order channels for hardware and software systems.
</a>

<p>
Essentially, the whole retail computer trade would be made obsolete, 
and so would the service sector than normally performs installation 
functions.

<p>
In other words, we are technically at a point where we can "automate 
ourselves out of our jobs".  I don't think this is bad, it's just 
that we need some sort of income to compensate for the lack of 
employment.

<p>
Personally, I think Microsoft Windows is an o.k. product, with a lot 
of great hardware and software.  It's just that I don't believe in 
paying for the software, and I don't believe in paying middlemen for 
the hardware, especially when the hardware is outdated before it's 
advertised!

<p>
So, we need a system for amnesty for technology workers, and 
filtering to prevent the labor and service sector from being 
panicked.  

<p>
In my opinion, the solution is to switch over the Riegel economic 
system (i.e., forgive all debts, and pay knowledge workers an 
allowance for being discrete about their knowledge of extropy).
