star trek.  at the time (1968) the sci fi options for the tv viewer were so
lame,
<br>
it was an insult to even my 7 year old brain.  then star trek came along,
and it was a bolt from the clear sky.  i have often wondered what made
that show so very special.  i realized what it was recently while in a video
store which had a section called "sci-fi / horror".  so.  our future is
horrifying.
<br>
but star trek dared to predict a future where mankind did pretty well for
herself.  things were working out.  not perfect, but damned good.
that had a great impact on me.  spike
