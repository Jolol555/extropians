<p>
There's no law against gifts under lf-capitalism.  Indeed, arguably one of
the biggest advantages of anarcho-capitalism (for those who are keen on
this sort of thing) is that all you have to do to create anarcho-socialism
in an anarcho-capitalist society is share all of your property with those
of like minds.  Compare this to gov't mediated socialism or socialism as
outlined by Marx, who conceded that it might even take *another revolution*
to get from socialism to utopia, and you can see that anarcho-capitalism is
much more in line with "gift culture" communism than socialism could ever be.

<p>
Ultimately, those who want to reach anarcho-socialism but recognize that it
is not immediately attainable should recognize that the best way to get
there is through anarcho-capitalism, not through the nationalization of
property.
