Hi Scott and list,

<p>
I take back my initial posting: this is an exciting list. thanks for all 
your thoughts, on and off list.

<a href="1018.html#1026qlink2">&gt;Really?  A desire for privacy is part of human nature?  Are there any</a><br>
<i>&gt;studies that support that hypothesis?  Do you mean to say that there was</i><br>
<i>&gt;some evolutionary advantage available to those who preferred to be alone?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any other advantages come to mind that might have resulted in a</i><br>

<p>
Wow! a scientific attitude to human nature!

<p>
I am not aware of studies which demonstrate that, to paraphrase and 
extend this logic, libertarian values were selected for. Robert Ardrey 
argued that territoriality (property) was innate. He also argued that 
enmity and amity are innate and result in human cooperative systems. He, 
like Desmond Morris after him, popularised the notion that large 
corporations with their concentration of alpha-positions to a privileged 
few lead to increased suicide and depression (there is good scientific 
evidence that major depression is (in part) an adaptation to 
lower-than-desired social status.

<p>
Humans want to be part of a group and some of them want to dominate the 
group.

<p>
<a name="1028qlink1">My hypothesis is that libertarians are partly the confluence of extreme 
scores on some independent underlying shared dimensions such as hi 
openness, low agreeableness, low Neuroticism and empathy, and hi 
intelligence. We have a study investigating this at present, examining 
the relationship between the major dimensions of personality, libertarian 
views, and susceptibility to superstition.</a> 

<p>
Partly, though, I think that libertarians are trans-human. That they have 
genes which are at very low levels outside the libertarian population, 
partly because without technological augmentation, we are at greatly 
increased risk of being hung, shot, tortured to death, and being burned 
at the stake ;-) 

<p>
I think these are genes for not acknowledging the legitimacy of the will 
of the band or tribe. It seems likely that the tribe genes are still 
present but are overridden.  I say this because I am sure we all get 
lonely and wish to have close friends etc. However some intellectual 
vision, commonly found in hackers, keeps us from being able to be close 
simply for closeness' sake: there has to be a logic to a view before we 
will subscribe.

<p>
Just as 92% of computer users are too stupid/indifferent to change their 
default Internet browser, and have no idea of the critical importance of 
crypto, privacy is not an innate demand because most people have no 
philosophy other than "maximise the difference between my stuff and your 
stuff, at any cost". Do not get between these people and stuff unless you 
have a gun.

<p>
cheers,
