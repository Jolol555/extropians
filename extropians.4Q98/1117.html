True, but I lived in England before that, espousing the same views. I
started the first European cryonics organization at a time when it would be
considered terribly un-English, what! When I first became a full-fledged
libertarian in 1981, there probably weren't more than 250 of us in the
country. I still went to school wearing badges (US: "buttons") saying
"Taxation is Theft" and "Legalize Heroin". I wrote an extremely unpopular
article in 1983 arguing against the age of consent laws which was
circulated in the houses of parliament and which got me called "a morally
deformed exhibitionist" and "a precocious guru of the New Right" by a
newspaper. Ah, the good old days! I still treasure those insults! Even over
<a name="1154qlink1">here, in Extropy #3, I wrote an article under my own name in which I
praised psychedelic drugs (rather more extravagantly than I would now).

<p>
So, it's not only in relatively hospitable environments like California
that I've been open.</a>
