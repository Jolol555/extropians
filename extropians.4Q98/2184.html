<a href="2178.html#2184qlink1">&gt;One obvious point is that many of the brightest and best-educated</a><br>
<i>&gt;people in the world move to America because that's where they have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the best prospects for advancement. I saw a documentary a while</i><br>
<i>&gt;ago which claimed that some huge percentage of the top scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt;in America were born and raised in Europe, and emigrated there</i><br>
<i>&gt;afterwards; I think it was something like 30% British, but don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;remember the exact figures. I can't back this up with any other </i><br>
<i>&gt;cites, but it makes sense to me.</i><br>

<p>
Actually a single village in Hungary is the title holder for
most/best intellects exported to America. (see Richard Rhodes books
on the atomic/hydrogen bombs.)

<p>
<a href="2178.html#2184qlink2">&gt;A country deson't need a great education system when the best</a><br>
<i>&gt;people from  all over the world choose to live there.</i><br>

<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; more America bashing. Nearly half of the people to ever win
a Nobel Prize call a single American University (the University of
Chicago ) home. We also produce our own, Richard Feynman is
equivalent to any you could name.

<p>
Grade school education in the U.S. is a holdover of the industrial
era, designed to produce a product to feed the same. At the
University level it is a completely different game, the education
system is world class and a multi-billion dollar industry for the
U.S. 

<p>
Grade schools are also highly political creatures. Here in Chicago,
they had descended as low as they could go. The current mayor
changed the system, appointed a CEO of the school system and let
him do his job. The results are incredible, even the hate-Chicago
downstate legislators give the man (Paul Vallas) an A+ rating. They
have a ways to go, but they are on their way. Housing is the city
is becoming a hot commodity again, the improving schools cited as
a major part of the reason.

<p>
Education is a very valuable commodity in a global economy, smart
parents will do everything necessary to see their offspring get the
best, (preferably better than the rest) after all, there can only
be so many CEO's.

<p>
For an interesting read, (although a bit dated) see "Buckminster
Fuller on education."
