We can look at how current intentional-but-genderless entities
get attracted to each other, form unions and produce offspring.
Look at corporations, research groups, and communities.
(Also, memetic evolution, genetic algorithms, etc.)
It's all there already, with all purposes - economy, exploration,
and fun. One can still find analogies with sexual reproduction
here in terms of gender, courting, intercourse, birth, and
child-raising, but I believe there are certain limits beyond which
such analogies shouldn't be stretched.
<br>
<a name="1793qlink1">Interestingly enough, most of intentional reproduction is already
non-sexual, and sex is no longer necessary for even its original
purpose - to produce human offspring.  It will probably be
considered reckless in the near future, to produce children by
blind combinations of genes, without first running the new DNA
through at least a medical check-up.
<br>
So it looks like sex and genders have a very limited future...</a>
