<a name="3059qlink1">_I_ am trying to educate others that government is not the cure-all
that many believe it is.  Business competition in a free and open
market will do much more for individual; thus for society.  We are in
a society of individuals.  For society to succeed, the good of the
individual must be placed above ALL else.</a>

<a name="3059qlink2">Nestle is doing what the government has allowed it to do.  The
government that controls education and nearly everything else in that
nation state is being unethical by permitting a company to abuse it's
population.  It does not provide a good education for the people and
the government's leaders benefit monetarily at the expense of those
who should be protected by them.</a>
