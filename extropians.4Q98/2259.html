I quote the following from the actual page that is listed at the top of this

<a href="2241.html#2259qlink2">&gt; Too Much to Absorb</a><br>
<i>&gt;              One of the key findings after an analysis of more</i><br>
<i>&gt;              than 1,500 textbook and curricula frameworks</i><br>
<i>&gt;              from about 50 countries was that Americans tried</i><br>
<i>&gt;              to teach too much, Schmidt said in a telephone</i><br>
<i>&gt;              interview.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   For example, U.S. math textbooks for 8th</i><br>
<i>&gt;              graders cover about 35 topics compared to an</i><br>
<i>&gt;              average of seven in Germany and Japan, he said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;              U.S. curricula also covered more topics than in</i><br>
<i>&gt;              those of virtually all other TIMSS countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   This can be a problem because it gives</i><br>
<i>&gt;              teachers little time to spend on each topic and</i><br>
<i>&gt;              textbooks often repeat familiar ones, Schmidt</i><br>
<i>&gt;              explained. This fails to challenge students and</i><br>
<i>&gt;              causes them to lose interest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   “This is the mile-wide, inch-deep curriculum</i><br>
<i>&gt;              we are talking about,” he said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   However, the study also showed U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;              students did not start off at the bottom of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;              educational ladder, even though they dropped</i><br>
<i>&gt;              down quickly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2264qlink1">So we are trying to teach too much, eh? I can understand the repetition of
familiar topics. I remember that most math teachers would spend</a> the entire first
<a name="2264qlink2">quarter of the year reviewing what the kids were supposed to learn</a> the previous
year.

<p>
<a name="2264qlink3">The problem as I see it is that teachers are to reticent to hold</a> poor students
<a name="2264qlink4">back, and far far too reticent to advance smart students forward ahead of
schedule. As are parents. We are far too concerned about developing</a> the social
<a name="2264qlink5">skills of students than about what they are actually learning in classes.</a> Kids
<a name="2264qlink6">have no real need to know the people they are in primary</a> and secondary school
<a name="2264qlink7">with that well. Most of the kids I went to school with at that age</a> I have not
<a name="2264qlink8">seen in ten years, nor would I care to see most of them.
