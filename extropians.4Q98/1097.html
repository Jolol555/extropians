Perhaps I overstepped my assertion here.  I meant to say it's been my experience
the more someone explores alternative reality tunnels, the more they're likely to
hide it from the 'tribal' consensus.  Obviously, there would be very little
memetic change if this were completely true.  I for one am *not* totally open on
certain issues, as it could cost me my job.  Its simply a matter of degree.  To
use an extreme example - would you feel comfortable discussing your views on
interracial relationships at a Ku Klux Klan meeting?  Probably not if you value
your life.  Either you hide your views from the Klan collective or you get the
hell out of Klan City.  I think the same can be said for most people who find
themselves outside their cultural continuum.  Because of that, I am not surprised
that the majority of transhumanists are strong privacy advocates.
