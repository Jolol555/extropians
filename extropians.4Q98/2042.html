<p>
I would be sceptical of this kind of investigation. Piracetam seems to
act on the memory consolidation process, likely by enhancing
reorganization or something like that. The effects are
non-obvious. Hydergine is, if I recall correctly, able to increase
brain bloodflow and presumably useful, but might also be rather hard
to notice. Vassopressin on the other hand has a lot of peripheral and
central effects, and it is likely that it is they that are noticeable,
not the memory enhancing effect.

<p>
The problem here is that it is easy to mix up placebo effects (you
feel energized, this makes you think you are getting brighter and you
study with more zest) with real effects. Substances that have been
shown to exhibit memory enhancing properties in general do not have
noticeable effects (except for some of the truly heavy substances like
amphetamines, of course).
