Agreed, it is easy to underestimate.

I can't prove were not already uploaded, so why should I care if we
upload within the upload if nothing more than for the sake of
</a>efficiency.  I suppose it might be hard to emulate, in a Turing
equivalent machine, the trickery needed to give us these quantum
weirdness results were starting to discover.  Could it be possible
that our clock is halted while our so called quantum computer does its
calculations?  I guess if you could prove that a truly random process
exist in nature rather than a very good pseudo-random one, I would
have to concede that at least we're not on a Turing equivalent.  It's
hard to predict irrational objections to uploading, but I'm more
interested in the rational ones anyway.
