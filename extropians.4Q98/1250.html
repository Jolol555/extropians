Hell, some of us don't need any cotton-picking genetic engineering to feel a
little superior. But that in itself doesn't make you a bigot in my book.
After all, I think I have a superior moral system to a god-believer, but I
don't think that makes me a religious (or anti-religious) bigot. As long as
my opinions are rational and I don't seek to deny rights to any other</a> person
based upon their ethnic/religious status, who cares what my feelings
regarding our relative abilities are?

<p>
But this does raise a significant question, which may or may not have a
ready answer depending upon how much humanism is in transhumanism. The
Humanist Manifesto II of 1973 specifically prohibits discrimination (but not
feelings of superiority) as normally defined (except sexual orientation
isn't explicitly mentioned), and I think it would also include transhuman vs
human discrimination. If transhumanist fully embrace humanist ethics, then
we have at least a firm ethical stance on the issue.
