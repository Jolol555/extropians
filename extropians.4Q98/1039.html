His failure to champion the current plate of conservative issues is
indicative of his moderacy. He worked towards lowering capital gains rates
and other general GOP goals but did not actively support the flat tax,
school prayer (disguised as the "religious freedom" amendment), and other
ultra-conservative bile that populated the legislative landscape. The
moderation of liberals has forced conservatives to become more conservative
to differentiate themselves from their counterparts. The stoking of the
Christian Right doesn't help anything either. Gingrich simply was not the
right person for Speaker. Remember, the Speaker's primary purpose is not as
spokesperson for the GOP but instead as shepherd of the legislative process.
Gingrich had little appetite for the ultra-conservative issues. The GOP
leadership wanted someone who did, enter Livingston and his histrionics.

<p>
I think 13-19% is too high for Gingrich running as president. However, the
chances that Gingrich will be the running mate of a GOP presidential
candidate are considerably higher, in my opinion.
