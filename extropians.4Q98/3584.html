Yes, that's what I meant.  Upload, make however many copies you want, then
run them in VR or download to more-or-less-human bodies.

Running a brute-force simulation of the matter in the human mind, based on
some kind of molecular simulation software, would take somewhere in the
general neighborhood of 10^30 MFLOPS.  In contrast, duplicating the actual
processing the human brain performs would take something like 10^8 MFLOPS.
With the usual assumption of a 2-year doubling time for computer power, we
will be able to run that second program in a supercomputer by 2010, but the
brute-force approach won't be possible until around 2160.  Do you really
think its going to take us that long to build the first assembler?

<p>
Besides, to make that curve hold we will need to start using nanotechnology
to build computers by the middle of the century.

<p>
Understanding a human mind isn't nearly as hard as building a computer
capable of simulating the human brain in complete detail.  The technology
required to keep Moore's law going through the 21st century would also give
us the ability to probe the workings of a living brain on a routine basis.
This, in turn, would allow us to create computer simulations of its
functional components (using advanced neural net systems, not chemistry
simulations).  Such simulations would trivial amounts of computing power for
the machines then in use, which means that researchers would be able to test
alternative theories quickly and easily.  Once you can do that, I have
trouble seeing how it could take more than a few decades to unravel how the
whole system works.

<p>
Even by a conservative estimate, that gives us the ability to design brain
modifications by the end of the 21st century.  At that point we are still 60
years shy of being able to run the brute-force sim.  So far as I can see,
anything that puts off the first development would delay the second by just
as much.  I think I feel safe making a call on this one...
