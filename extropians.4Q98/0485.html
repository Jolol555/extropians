Point of order: Shaun asks for tangible evidence for a predicted future event.
I think we all need to agree that this is infeasible. I therefore assume
Shaun wants to see Elizier's methodology for extrapolating present trends
to his predicted outcome. Elezier and others have covered this ground
many times, most recently in the singuarity discussion on the transhuman
list.

A small clarificaton: you mean that nanotech results in posthumanity.
<a name="0490qlink2">I agree. However, nanotech is not the only way to get there. For
example, I claim that strong AI also results in posthumanity,</a> so
<a name="0490qlink3">even in the unlikely event that nanotech should prove to be infeasible,
that won't prevent the advent of posthumanity. Incidentally, I don't see
how nanotech self-replication results in posthumanity in days or weeks
unless it gets there by a massive increase in computing capacity resulting
in a massive increase in the intelligence of some computer-augmented or
computer-based intelligence. But, the existance of a such an intelligence
can easily result in nanotech in days or weeks.
