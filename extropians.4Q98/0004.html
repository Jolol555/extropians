thanks for the info dennis.  the tea bags and sodas just went into the trash.
i now realize the weakness of my own idea of starting a two-question
web survey for renal stones and coffee consumption:  before june, i
would never have had the slightest interest in the subject, and so would
never have gone to the website.   but since ---&gt; the incident &lt;----
anything on the subject of kidney stones has my complete and undivided.

<p>
healthy people will not bother with these websites.  {8-[  because we
would be inadvertently preselecting those who have suffered, we would get
an overwhelming signal linking kidney stones to everything: coffee, tea, soda,
extropians, web surfing, everything.

<p>
this has been a fascinating and educational query however.  i have a
new appreciation for the difficulties of the medics.  {8^D  spike
