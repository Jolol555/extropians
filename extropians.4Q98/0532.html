I'm usually more frugal in quoting the message I'm replying to, but all of
the above seems to be needed for context here.

<p>
First let me note that I understand your response, thanks to your
elaboration. I was thinking of the changes I made in the Principles when
moving from "Spontaneous Order" to "Open Society". Part of my intent was to
leave open the possibility of alternative, non-monetary, non-price system
decentralized mechanisms. Although I firmly believe that a market price
system *currently* is the best way to ensure freedom and growing wealth for
everyone (to the extent that governments refrain from tampering other than
to refine the underlying legal rules), I do not want to rule out the
possibility of a replacement in future. I *do* want the Principles to rule
out a coercive, centralized allocation system that compels individuals to
follow orders. A transhumanist could believe in the desirability of such a
system, but they would not be an Extropian transhumanist.

<p>
<a name="0537qlink1">When I wrote "The market price system encourages conservation,
substitution, and innovation, preventing any need for a brake on growth and
progress", I was making a statement that I believe is correct. But I did
not intend to say that the market price system in principle is the *only*
system that could do this. If a superior non-coercive, decentralized
economic system arises, well fine. I don't see any sign of such an
alternative but I do not rule it out as a possibility.

<p>
Perhaps I can rephrase the above quote to be more inclusive. Again, I only
want to rule out coercive, centralized economic systems as incompatible
with core extropian principles, not possible future developments compatible
with these values. I could replace "The market price system" with something
like "Effective economies, currently in the form of the market price
system...". Not terribly elegant, but perhaps someone can suggest a better
phrasing.

Thanks for your feedback, Maxwell.

<p>
Onward!
