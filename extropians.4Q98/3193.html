<p>
All of them.

<p>
Bigots should be just as able to operate a corporation as anyone else, 
but they're not going to prosper in any society where the majority of 
people aren't bigots. And if the majority are, well, that's dumbocracy
for you.

<p>
Many corporations have to pollute in order to operate; some of us just
recognize that the cost of the pollution is offset by the value of what
they produce. In a free market, polluters would have to incorporate the
cost of anti-pollution legal actions into their prices and the cost/benefit
tradeoff would be even clearer.

<p>
Price gougers? There was an interesting discussion about this on Usenet
a while ago, where people pointed out that a smart thing for some
corporation with plenty of money to do would be to fill up warehouses
with today's cheap food and sell it in 2000 for many times the current
price. But that would be "price-gouging", and hence illegal in many 
places (e.g. the guy who was charged for shipping and selling generators
in recent ice storms) so it won't happen and if Y2K is bad people will 
starve because of those laws. Ah, the wonders of government regulation.
