No. You can define "green" as such for a particular purpose, but this
definition will pretty quickly run against people's intuitive
understanding. You can perceive things as green with a different or no
spectrum at all involved.

<p>
Before people start philosophizing about color, I strongly suggest they
read this book:

<p>
    C.L. Hardin
<br>
    Color for Philosophers
<br>
    Hackett, 1988
<br>
    ISBN 0-87220-039-6

<p>
Highly recommended.

<p>
Contrary to what you might expect from the title, the book is not much
about philsophy. Rather, it summarizes what is scientifically known
about human color perception. That's quite a bit, and probably a lot
that you don't know yet. As the author writes in somewhat politer words,
you better know already established facts before you philosophize on a
topic, otherwise you run the risk of spouting only so much garbage.

<p>
Sorry, pet peeve of mine. Human color vision is *complicated*, and
people, including eye doctors, generally know very little about it. That
cone and rod stuff you learn in school hardly scratches the surface.
