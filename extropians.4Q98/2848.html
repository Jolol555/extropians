<p>
Joe asks:
<br>
<a href="2840.html#2848qlink1">"How could the Central Americans reover from the hurricane without</a><br>
<a name="2864qlink1">global gov't-coordinated assistance?  None of them are in any
position to help each other (at least not enough)."</a>

<p>
How about by simply appealing for help? Time and time again we've seen
masses of people give freely of their time and wealth to help others in
desperate plights.

<p>
It's a fact that private charity still outdoes the bureaucrats'
<br>
"generosity" (using other people's money), despite confiscatory tax rates.<br>
It's also a fact that most real (uncoerced) charity goes to the people who
need it, whereas "charity" through taxation goes mostly to line the
adminstrative officials' pockets.

<p>
I might add that it's people's responsibility to protect their assets, for
instance, by insurance. If the Central Americans are too poor to afford
insurance, it's because they're kept poor by the effects of forcible
tampering with the economy.
