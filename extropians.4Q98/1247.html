<p>
There is no evidence for this, at least in the usual sense of "growing
up" (i.e. developing adult mental abilities, an adult personality). If
you mean "breaking down self-serving bias" it is also not obvious that
stress is the best way of doing it.

<p>
Emotional maturity is tricky to define. A lot of pessimists claim they
are realists; are they emotionally mature?<a name="1271qlink1"> But I think you have a
point in that life threatening experiences can have positive effects,
possibly by dissolving various previous imprints. Of course, we have a
sample bias since the people who get positive effects tend to speak
more about it than the people who got bad results.</a>

<a href="1237.html#1247qlink3">&gt; There's an interesting Dilbert cartoon in which Dilbert thinks, "Sometimen I</a><br>
<i>&gt; feel like I've been faking everything since fourth grade.  I wonder if other</i><br>
<i>&gt; people get that feeling."  A few days after the crisis had passed, I realized</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would never get that feeling again.</i><br>

<p>
Dilbert really is a surprising source of wisdom sometimes.

<p>
I'm working on it :-) There is an interesting section about this
matter (as a lot of other &gt;H-relevant stuff) in Austin's _Zen and the
Brain_ (I'm getting tired of referring to it all the time, but even if
you disagree with his conclusions it is a good review of the
neuropsychology of unusual mental states with a nice bibliography).
