<p>
There is much less consensus that life extension is morally wrong 
(than that torturing... is wrong) . I think most people would think 
it is morally ok, at least if one could convince them that 
overpopulation problems could be solved. A few might still insist 
that it is wrong, but they would be mistaken.</a>
