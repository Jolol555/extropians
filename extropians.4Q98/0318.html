Without wanting to contribute yet another redefinition, I'd note that "human" has
both a singular and collective meaning. The focus so far has been on the effects
of technology on individual humans. Won't the effects on our collective
intelligence and capabilities will be just as significant? I can imagine a
transhuman future in which our clear individual boundaries, defined by biological
bodies, seem rather quaint. Some transhumans may be descendants of what were
several individuals in our era, or even components of different individuals. Max's
definitions seem to leave that wider possibility open, but the examples apply to
individuals.

<p>
I think for a dictionary definition however, the focus on the individual
possibilities is the right one.
