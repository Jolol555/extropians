<p>
With aleph-null flops, the whole consolidation process could be 
completed in an arbitrarily short time, just by cranking up the 
clockspeed of everything, including yourself. Consolidate one 
millimeter in the first second, another in the next half second and 
so on. Within two seconds you could have consolidated all of infinity 
if you do it right. 

<p>
Of course, measured in subjective time the process could take quite 
long, unless you find a way to complete it "automatically", i.e. 
without sentient guidence along the way. (Without sentience, I 
suppose there would be no subjective time.)
