<i>&gt; I think a critical issue with a macro assembler is positioning. Once you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; position components accurately and verify that they are there, you can also</i><br>
<i>&gt; position work tools and build the components. I don't think lego blocks give you</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot of inherent clues about their position. Still, I agree availability is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; big plus. A lot depends on the functionality of the active components they</i><br>
<i>&gt; provide.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I've been thinking about macro-assemblers for a long time. The model I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been thinking about I call the Universal Fabricator Replicator (UFR), on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle that any engineering project needs an obscure acronym :-). It useful</i><br>
<i>&gt; feature is that it can disassemble anything it builds. Building one off things</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of generalized robust components seems likely to be more expensive than</i><br>
<i>&gt; using bulk technology. But when you can download a new design for you living</i><br>
<i>&gt; room, and simply disassemble the old one to make the new, you are into a whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; new ball game. Like nanotech, you drop much of the bulk transport and central</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturing. Even with nanotech, it may be energetically cheaper to assemble</i><br>
<i>&gt; large objects from largish (millimeter?) components.</i><br>

   Hi.  I'm very new here.  I wondered if it would correct etiquette to ask for any
more information anyone has on CNTs and perhaps the constuction of them.  I'm
looking to expand a previous scholarship essay.  In that strange limbo between rich
and poor, knowlegable and brilliant, deserving and...maybe not, it's quite a game to
get to college.  Actually, if anyone has any info that might help with that little
problem as well, it'd be much appreciated.
