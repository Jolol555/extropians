There is also "Pastwatch" by Orson Scott Card, where you could actually view
the past.

<p>
The story goes that past viewing started out as a super historiography project,
then became a project to send someone into the past to prevent Cristopher
Columbus from discovering the New World and causing the genocide of the Native
Americans. Turns out that a previous timeline had sent an expedition back to
make him discover the new world, in order to prevent the vicious Aztec
civilization from decimating Europe and killing millions of poor savage
Europeans.
