I completely disagree here.  There was a prominent study done at the Maryland State
Penitentiary in 1961, where 80 hardened criminals of all stripes were put through a
series of LSD sessions.  Since this study was conducted by Timothy Leary &amp; Company,
the most sensitive measures were taken to assure the criminals were given the best
'set' and 'setting' possible.  Although many of the criminals were initially suspect,
Tim Leary was very patient in establishing a trusting bond before any LSD sessions
took place.

After six weeks, the overwhelming number of prisoners became distinctly aware that
their are many alternative 'realities' to that of crime and struggle.  As of 1977, 67
of the initial 80 had been released, with only 2 ever going back to prison.  Lets see,
2 out of 67 gives us ~3% recidivism.  I'd say that was a pretty darn good success rate
for only *one* study!

<p>
The fact that today, prisons are:


<OL>
  <li>  Overpopulated with non-violent drug users.
  <li>  Admittedly designed by prison architects to disorient criminals.
  <li>  And run as a means to punish, rather than rehabilitate.


</OL>
<p>
I'd say the prisons have absolutely no desire to rehabilitate anyone; and in fact are
the chief *cause* of crime, not a deterrent.  If we spent half the money on education,
we do now on prisons, this supposed "high crime" rate we see today would be seen as
the joke that it really is.

<p>
Speaking of brainwashing TV propaganda, the latest TV statistics show that the number
of stories covering violent crimes has increased five fold since 1990, while the
actual violent crime rate, according to the FBI, has dropped. Doesn't that make you
wonder?  I'd say the prison construction lobby has a vested interest in seeing more
people being locked up behind bars, and longer sentences being applied to more people.
