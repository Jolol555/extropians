"Reovirus Therapy of Tumors With Activated ras Pathway."
Science 282(5392): 1332-1334 November 13, 1998

<p>
Abstract:

<p>
  Human reovirus requires an activated Ras signaling pathway for infection
of cultured cells. To investigate whether this property can be exploited
for cancer therapy, severe combined immune deficient mice bearing tumors
established from v-erbB-transformed murine NIH 3T3 cells or human U87
glioblastoma cells were treated with the virus. A single intratumoral
injection of virus resulted in regression of tumors in 65 to 80 percent of
the mice. Treatment of immune-competent C3H mice bearing tumors established
from ras-transformed C3H-10T1/2 cells also resulted in tumor regression,
although a series of injections were required. These results suggest that,
with further work, reovirus may have applicability in the treatment of
cancer.
