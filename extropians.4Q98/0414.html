A modern high-end PC delivers roughly 10^9 ops peak. Such performance is
distinctly underpowered to run even _one_ neuroanatomically correct neuron
in realtime. Since we have several 10^9 neurons to account for, I do not
see how a factor of 10^4 can make a measurable difference.

<p>
Even if we drop the requirements of having to emulate a particular human
brain and settle for an intelligent system instead, I very much doubt that
a 10 k node 21264 Beowulf is capable of intelligent action, however
carefully programmed. (Thinking of several billion transistors/node I
can't help but to notice that a 10 k node Beowulf would seem a
particularly wasteful way of utilizing them, maybe a 10^14 transistor WSI
FPGA++ run by GA could make a fair score on the Turing test).

<p>
I don't think that Moravec's notorious underestimates are doing the whole
field of AI a credit.
