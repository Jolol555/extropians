Screw the wacky human goal system.  Trying to be "happy" with the default
diencephalon is chasing wind.  The system isn't optimized so you'll wind up
happy and stay that way, it's optimized so that you have more and more
children.  Unhappy with what you have?  Want more?  What a #@$!ing surprise. 
Face it, there ain't no way to stay happy, the goals you chase to "be happy"
at any given time are arbitrary and probably self-destructive, and the whole
game is rigged to begin with.  You can act rationally or spend your life
trying to tickle a few serotonergic receptors, but you can't do both.
