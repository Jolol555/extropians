I don't see why you should give primacy to human nature at all. Isn't
civilisation all about overriding our original human nature to allow us to live
in larger groups? Potty training of children springs to mind, which makes public
health systems workable. If a lot of people like privacy, that's a good reason
for not forcing them to give it up.

<p>
 I'd guess "no privacy" would work just fine in a town where everyone had agreed
to it, and all had a suitable level of mutual tolerance. No selling the tapes to
outsiders though.</a>
