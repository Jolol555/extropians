<p>
This advance only consisted of repairing a known mutation in cells removed 
from the body.  So to use it to fix all mutations in a human body, you'd
have to take each cell out of the body, sequence its genome for mutations,
repair them, and then put the cell back.  Given that you have a couple
trillion
<br>
cells, and that each individual sequencing is the equivalent of the entire
human genome project, you have a lot of work to do.

<p>
It *is* a promising advance - you might be able to alter, say, blood stem
cells without making them immunogenic, and it's great for all kinds of
research.
<br>
But it's not *that* good.
