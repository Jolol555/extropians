<a name="3283qlink1">    I've always had a very positive outlook on the future of humanity,
it's ability to improve itself, (or atleast that there is a lot of room
for
<br>
improvement :-) ), etc etc, BUT...

<p>
<a name="3314qlink1">    Since many people out there are less positive and tend to believe
that there will be majorly horrible events occuring in the next 24
months ahead</a> of us; I believe there may be some people in power
<a name="3287qlink1">out there where if "God doesn't deliver" (notice the sarcasm there),
then they will..<a name="3314qlink2">   Meaning we could have religious nuts (middle east?),
or just general doomsdayers (terrorists, etc), causing all kinds of
destruction to our planet and our civilization.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3314qlink3">    Anyone given any thought on this?  And is there anything we can
do as extropians to prevent these useless and backward-thought
actions from happening?.</a>  I believe I've read that around 999 AD
there were some major events occuring (ie: Wars were started
for the end of the world), well with the advent of mass-</a>destruction
technology, we only need one warring party to bring an end to
us all...

<p>
    Just a thought..
