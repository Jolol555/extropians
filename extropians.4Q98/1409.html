All of the above and none of the above.Could be composed of the above,
but not necessary.

<p>
At this moment, i think an identity is a dynamically evolving whole
interacting with his dynamically evolving environment. The distinction
of what is in the whole and what is outside the whole could be of
course, somewhat arbitrary. I don't believe in the notion of pure free
will for example.

<p>
For me, a good compromise between the identity complexity and the
complexity of his outside world and the bandwidth of interactions
between the two has to be reached to provide an "interesting" identity.

<p>
If the surrounding of the identity is poor, if there is not too much
interactions according to the complexity of the identity, the identity
is somewhat in a state of stagnation... that's not what i wish.

<p>
"interesting" mean here, something that grow exponentially faster in
complexity.

<p>
A "one" is something that can have "many" "parts", a "part" is a "one"
;)

<p>
<a href="1396.html#1409qlink3">&gt; Bonus question:  Why do you care?</a><br>

<p>
Because i've really been dynamically shaped internally and by my
environment to like to try to think, at least a little, to such things
;)

<p>
I do not take me seriously and i'm of course aware this his mostly
wishful thinking and that in the end i can't understand even an
infinitesimal of what has to come in the future.
