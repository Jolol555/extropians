So, let me get this straight...Nestle is somehow causing these unfortunate
mothers to suddenly become stupid and deplete their own bodies' milk
supply. Must be some nefarious new secret mind-control beam, eh? Bet the
"governments" of the world would pay a pretty penny for that technology. Oh
wait, why don't they just trump up an "antitrust" suit against Nestle and
force them to give up the secret?

<p>
It's sickening to see you twist an act of benevolence (or at worst, PR) on
Nestle's part into some monstrous conspiracy. I guess you have to come up
with some kind of corporate misdeed to compare to the wholesale slaughter
and destruction wrought by "governments" every day. But even if your
suspicions are correct, there's simply no comparison.
