kathryn, this is something with which i have struggled mightily.  i carefully
approached my immediate family with the notion of cryonics, and their
reactions astounded me.  both my father and grandmother agreed such a
scheme would probably work, but forbade me from arranging their
cryopreservation.  they do not wish to come back in the future.  my
mother thought it would not work, but allowed me to freeze her corpse
if it would make me feel better.

<p>
now, i would not go against my father and grandmother's wishes, so, what
if i had not said anything, but just gone ahead and made the arrangements?
i have aunts and uncles to think about here, who have not heard the notion
yet.  obviously, until i resolve this, i will not mention it to them.  what do i
do?
