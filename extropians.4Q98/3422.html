Abstract
<br>
  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in end-stage renal
  disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis. In these patients,
  hypertriglyceridemia appears to increase the risk of accelerated
  atherosclerosis. The present placebo-controlled study evaluated prospectively
  lipid-lowering effects of pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) in 6
  ESRD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. The design of the study
  entailed a placebo phase of 1 week followed by 3 weeks of PZG, 400 mg three
  times a day. Compared to placebo, PZG reduced serum triglycerides (PZG vs.
  placebo 370 +/- 171 vs. 414 +/- 182 mg/dl; p = 0.01). PZG also tended to
  decrease total cholesterol. In addition, PZG selectively lowered blood
  glucose in hyperglycemic patients. PZG was well tolerated; it did not
  interfere with hemodynamic parameters or alter liver function tests,
  nutritional parameters or dialysis clearance.

Abstract
<br>
  In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats,
  pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) markedly reduced elevated fasting
  concentrations of plasma glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. In
  contrast, these parameters were unaffected by a sulfonylurea, glyburide, or
  by a biguanide, metformin. PZG's glucose- and lipid-lowering effects were
  dose-dependent. These metabolic effects were also investigated after: (a)
  pyrazinoic acid (PZA), a metabolite of PZG; (b) 3-amino-PZG, an analog of
  PZG, and (c) 3-amino-PZA, a hydrolytic product of 3-amino-PZG. PZA moderately
  reduced elevated fasting glucose and lipid concentrations in STZ-diabetic
  rats, suggesting partial medication of PZG's antidiabetic actions by PZA.
  Neither 3-amino-PZG nor 3-amino-PZA exerted any glucose- or lipid-lowering
  effect in STZ-diabetic rats.

Abstract
<br>
  This study was designed to determine whether
  pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) can attenuate cataract development
  in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After a single,
  intraperitoneal dose of STZ (45 mg/kg in 0.05 mol/l sodium citrate buffer),
  Sprague-Dawley rats (250-260 g) were divided into three groups. Beginning a
  week later, each group of diabetic rats received twice daily for 24 weeks by
  gavage one of the following: vehicle (saline 10 ml/kg), PZG (35 mg/kg), or
  captopril (15 mg/kg). PZG treatment prevented the development of diabetic
  cataracts (p = 0.0009 compared to vehicle). In contrast to PZG, 38% of
  vehicle-treated rats exhibited cataracts after 12 weeks, increasing to 89%
  after 16 weeks. At week 16, 22% of captopril-treated rats exhibited
  cataracts, a 75% reduction from vehicle-treated rats (p = 0.4289 compared to
  vehicle; p = 0.0571 compared to PZG). These results indicate that captopril
  can attenuate cataract formation in STZ-diabetic rats, whereas PZG completely
  suppresses it.

Abstract
<br>
  This study was designed to determine whether
  pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) can attenuate diabetic nephropathy
  in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced within 1
  week after a single intraperitoneal dose of STZ (45 mg/kg in 0.05 mol/l
  sodium citrate buffer). Diabetic rats were divided into five groups. Each
  group received by gavage for 24 weeks one of the following: vehicle (saline
  10 ml/kg, b.i.d.), PZG (35 mg/kg, b.i.d.), captopril (15 mg/kg, b.i.d.), or
  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 20 mg/kg, b.i.d.). Insulin (NPH 7.5 U/day) was
  given subcutaneously. PZG treatment for 24 weeks reduced mortality and
  attenuated diabetic nephropathy, as indicated by reduced urinary excretion of
  total protein (79% of control), low-molecular-weight protein (12% of
  control), and albumin (60% of control). PZG also preserved renal structure
  and function. Compared to HCTZ or vehicle-treated rats, STZ-diabetic rats
  receiving either captopril or insulin exhibited decreased excretion of total
  protein, low-molecular-weight protein, and albumin, as well as amelioration
  of renal pathology. Collectively, these results indicate that PZG, as well as
  captopril and insulin, improved longevity and several indices of diabetic
  nephropathy in STZ-diabetic rats.

Abstract
<br>
  Pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) is a new antihyperglycemic,
  antihyperlipidemic drug. The current study reports on the development of an
  animal model in which the favorable metabolic effects of PZG, previously
  described in diabetic patients, could be reproduced and investigated. Adult
  male as well as female Sprague-Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal
  dose (50 mg/kg) of streptozotocin (STZ). One week later, they received PZG
  (50 mg/kg i.p.) twice daily for a week. Compared to vehicle (saline-treated
  controls), PZG reduced plasma concentrations of glucose by 33-70%,
  triglycerides by 50-70%, nonesterified fatty acids by 17-27%, cholesterol by
  10-50%, and glucagon by 18-20%. Hydrochlorothiazide given in a dose of 20
  mg/kg i.p. b.i.d for 1 week induced metabolic effects opposite to those of
  PZG. In the Zucker fatty rat, PZG also lowered plasma glucose and lipid
  concentrations. These results indicate that PZG ameliorated the abnormalities
  of plasma glucose and lipid that characterize STZ-diabetic and Zucker fatty
  rats.

  Pyrazinoylguanidine downregulates the glucose fatty-acid

Abstract
<br>
  Eight hypertensive patients with noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
  (NIDDM) were administered the experimental drug
  pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) either alone or in combination
  with calcium-channel or beta-blockers. This treatment appeared to
  "downregulate" the glucose fatty acid cycle and reduced both systolic and
  diastolic blood pressures and mean body weight. Patients served as their own
  controls in this dose-escalation study, which included placebo treatment
  (baseline) 3 weeks, 300 mg PZG for 3 weeks and 600 mg for 3 weeks. PZG
  reduced increased serum concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose,
  and triglycerides (TG). TG concentrations correlated inversely with serum
  HDL-cholesterol concentrations. The beta-blockers used by several patients
  increased their FFA, glucose, insulin and TG concentrations, as well as
  blunting their response to PZG. The calcium-channel blockers exerted these
  effects to a much lesser extent. PZG reduced or abolished glycosuria, related
  to PZG's capacity to decrease hyperglycemia. Withdrawal of PZG restored
  glycosuria, as blood sugar increased. PZG was well tolerated. No patient
  reported any adverse effect or missed a weekly clinic visit (12 weeks). PZG
  deserves further study as supplementary and/or replacement therapy in NIDDM
  patients who are hypertensive and hyperlipidemic.

Abstract
<br>
  Pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) reduced the hyperglycemia,
  hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia of patients with non-insulin-dependent
  diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) as well as of normal subjects receiving
  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Mechanisms are proposed by which PZG
  downregulated the elevated glucose-fatty acid cycle toward a more normal
  level in NIDDM patients and in non-diabetic subjects maintained on HCTZ.
  Despite maintenance of these NIDDM patients on their current antihypertensive
  medication, PZG reduced further their systolic and diastolic pressures. PZG
  was well tolerated by both normal and NIDDM patients.

Abstract
<br>
  A single blind crossover study with washout phases showed that
  pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) reduced elevated serum
  concentrations of urea, triglycerides, and cholesterol in patients with renal
  insufficiency. Pyrazinoylguanidine was saluretic, without
  affecting serum potassium or glucose concentrations. The onset of PZG's
  antihypertensive effect occurred within 4 hours. In contrast,
  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) increased serum concentrations of urea,
  triglycerides, and glucose, without affecting cholesterol.

Abstract
<br>
  In a single-blind, placebo-controlled study of 12 subjects diagnosed as
  having mild to moderate hypertension and hypercholesterolemia,
  pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) in a dose of 600 mg twice daily
  for 4 weeks reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate.
  Pyrazinoylguanidine also reduced diastolic pressures, but to
  a lesser extent. Pyrazinoylguanidine reduced total serum
  cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Regression analysis indicated
  a dose-dependent reduction of both total cholesterol and LDL by PZG, i.e.,
  the higher the presenting serum concentration, the greater the reduction by
  PZG. The extent of the reductions produced by PZG in elevated cholesterols
  and LDLs was highly correlated (r = .949). Normal high-density lipoprotein
  levels were unchanged by PZG. Pyrazinoylguanidine increased
  24-hour urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium. Serum Na+, K+, or Clconcentrations
   were unaltered. Means for plasma aldosterone and renin
  activities tended to decrease, but these trends did not attain statistical
  significance. Pyrazinoylguanidine was well tolerated. An
  activity profile that includes antihypertensive effects as well as reduction
  in hypercholesterolemia without major impact on serum renin or electrolyte
  balance makes PZG an attractive candidate for the management of hypertension.
