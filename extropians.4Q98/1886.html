<a name="1908qlink1">John, can you explain to me why 1/3 of all convicted rapist turned out to be
innocent (and subsequently released), when DNA evidence became available to
acquit them?  I'd say that is an astounding figure</a> - especially considering that
the majority of victims in those cases are still alive to point the finger,
while the murdered victims are unable to do so.  A great deal of convicted
murderers are sent to prison on circumstantial evidence with no eyewitnesses at
all.  How then can you argue against the suggestion that a similar percentage of
convicted murderers are also innocent?  Regardless of anything else, it's
probably a safe suggestion that a sizable percentage of people on death row are
possibly innocent.

<p>
That's true, but potentially very unnecessary.  Please read my post on
'Rehabilitating Violent Criminals'.

<p>
So you are willing to kill a sizable percentage of innocent people to assure the
guilty are killed too?

<p>
Completely agree with you here. :-)
