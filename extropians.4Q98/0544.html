Perhaps its some sort of antibody reaction to foreign memes. Societies that
</a>
accepted new ideas too easily were destroyed by random passing memes. Only
ones with a strong, if irrational, resistance to new ideas survived. As with
many of our previously useful survival traits, our resistance to new ideas may
kill us.

<a name="0596qlink1"> I personally have seen some pretty scary reactions to new ideas, so I believe
its a serious problem. One solution would be to operate in
secret, but we have already blown</a> that. Another would be to form an isolated
community strong enough to go its own way. Not very likely to succeed I think.
Understanding and bypassing the process seems the best bet. But its a pretty
indelible response in some people I fear.
