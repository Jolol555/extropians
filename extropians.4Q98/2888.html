alexander, this is driven home to me every time i go to the voting booth.

<p>
my neighborhood, and my city (milpitas california) is half asian, ~8%
nonwhite
<br>
nonasian, ~15% other.  but if you go vote, and look around, most of
the people (~80%) are over-50 anglo.  i dont know where all the middle
age
<br>
anglos live.  i never see them except on voting day.

<p>
yes, *i* am damned interested in that.  i want to use it for finding
correllations between lifestyles and medical conditions, as
the extropian veterans are so tolerantly tired of hearing me
state.  there is an outfit called "votebot" in which you can submit
questions and they make a poll out of it and send it out to
volunteers.  again, it may not be representative, but for what
i want, it doesnt need to be.  search yahoo under "votebot".  spike
