<p>
But the paper *doesn't* show that most people overestimate cost.
The distribution of cost estimates is normal in log space, with
the mean log being pretty close to the right answer.  Some people
overestimate while others underestimate, but the median estimate
is about right.

<p>
Do people who overestimate the cost become less interested in cryonics
as a result?  I don't think Scott looked at that.
The raw data is included with the paper, in case someone else wants to
look into such questions.
