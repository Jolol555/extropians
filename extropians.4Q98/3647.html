&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0100,0100,0100&lt;/param&gt;Dear Math Wizards and Social Scientists:<br>


<p>
Taxes, like gravity, are a form of control.


<p>
IMO, if we announced on CNN that we just abolished the US Federal Tax 
system, then there would most certainly be unrest among certain 
veterans disinterested in the internet and information society 
politics.


<p>
How can we "liberate" everybody, all at once?


<p>
If we are to receive an allowance, in the form of 
Gutenberg/Heisenberg/Rubin/Mickey Money, then how much is enough?


<p>
Really, whatever amount brings relief from Bills and provides enough 
for the safety and security of my immediate family is good enough.


<p>
However, if I'm going to rob the treasury, why not have enough of a 
start to compensate for my being abused by the previous institutions?


<p>
I heard that Computer Sciences Corporation has received the contract 
to take over the IRS accounting systems.


<p>
$.111 * (number of minutes since my birth) = my 1998 tax return


<p>
Then, from that point forward, $.111/minute (since the time of the 
checks issuance) to be credited into one of my electronic commerce 
accounts.


<p>
Here's my D.O.B. information from the Astro Communications Services, 
Inc. (1-800-888-9983) Planetary Profile that my friend Terra gave to 
me as a gift.

Using this data to calculate my 1998 CSC tax return, I arrive at the 
following hush money amount:  $1,887,550.56 (Libertarian, Tax-Free)
