Thank you for asking such an important question, Steve.  

<p>
If nothing else, I think that transhumanists are positioned to provide a
reasoned perspective on such issues, and thereby to point out avenues of
action based on compassion and rationality rather than fear or hatred.  As
it stands now, most issues are framed in terms of victim/oppressor, and
there develops a sense that one can stand with either the victims or the
oppressors and gain a short-term advantage.  As transhumanists, we forsee
another course entirely, one based on a long-term view of where we are going
as humans.  Making the existence of this view known to others is probably
our most important task at this point.  Speaking up in venues that have
never heard from us before.  Planting the seeds for others to develop along
the same path.  Offering our praise and support to those who use science and
technology in positive ways.

<p>
With relation to actual 'actions', I think that we can link our own
individual interests with groups that are already working on certain issues.
I may not agree with everything feminist organizations say and do, but I can
link with them to achieve certain goals, and sometimes they actually
incorporate my suggestions.  Same goes for environmental organizations,
peace organizations, medical organizations, etc.  Through coalition
building, we can multiply our influence on the actions of various groups,
rather than attempting to take parallel actions.  

<p>
Sin,
