My memory was just jogged by the recent reference to a _new_ or perhaps
infrequently used term, computronium. I remember reading a 1950s short
story that as far as I know coined a term, electroponics.

<p>
The definition attached was simply the construction of things atom by atom
in the nanotech way. Personally I think its an apt term that would do good
to filter into common parlance.

<p>
Just as hydroponics means growing in a medium of water, electroponics
means to grow things in a a medium of electrons. Currently when people
talk of nanotech they talk a couple of generally different things.
1. Actual nanometer scale systems (computers, assemblers)
2. Macro or real world scale things that assemblers will produce
<p>
   but won't necessarily be much different from what we have today,
   (cheap materials, endless food supply, diamond bridges, etc.)

<p>
I think there's a useful split to be made between the new devices
in category 1 and the products (category 2) that those who own
the devices/IP for category 1 will make/sell.

<p>
You can do lots of stuff with nanotech. Wouldn't seperating out a subset
of electroponics aid understanding where the future is heading?
It would also make nanotech sound safer if people knew that its most
likely that its only category 2 things (things manufactured with
electroponics) were available in the public domain and the assemblers
(electroponics equipment) were safely locked away.

<p>
Your thoughts please!
