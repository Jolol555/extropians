  IAN: There is an external electrical mind control
  technology on the market. Unlike the flashing light 
  and sound machines, it delivers an electric impulse
  via clips placed on the ear lobes, and by that means 
  "entrains" the brain to follow the impulse frequency,
  and the general aim is to induce deep relaxation.</a>

<p>
  My best "spiritual" experiences, one that I mention 
  on one of my pages: <a href="http://Ian.Goddard.net/iam-free.htm">http://Ian.Goddard.net/iam-free.htm</a> 
  wherein I saw blazing and ego-dissolving white light, a
  profound experience of epic proportions, occurred whilst
  the Alpha-Stim (tm) electrodes were attached to my ear 
  lobes... mechanical nirvana! Of course, in each case I 
  was also practicing mediation on a regular basis, and
  should note that I have used the Alpha-Stim device many 
  times, and 99.9% of the time it just relaxes you, but
  on a few occasions, I really did "see the light." It
  seemed that in that light, all questions were answered, 
  and I realized directly that "I am" is eternal and allpervasive,
   free from any finite place in space-time.

<p>
  Such consciousness, if true, is not a local spirit with 
  thoughts, but is the very field of space and time itself.

<p>
  Of course, I always approach that experience as potentially
   false, and thus test it occurring to logical rule,
  and it seems to adhere to the logic that is found in the 
  relations of numbers: <a href="http://Ian.Goddard.net/yoga.htm">http://Ian.Goddard.net/yoga.htm</a>
