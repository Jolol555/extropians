 Lots of Bernard Hugheses, but only one with my web domain. Like many people here,
I usually put my domain name in my sig, which says a lot about me. I'm emotionally
an optimist, so I am hopeful my views won't make me a target. But intellectually,
I am more pessimistic. I recall how often quite "reasonable" people have gone into
"kill the weirdoes" mode over what seem to me strange but harmless lifestyle
choices. Not to mention some of the choices advocated here which would really
change the world.

<p>
 Despite my pessimism, I don't want to put much energy into covering my rear.
Moving forward is more attractive.
