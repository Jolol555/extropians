<a href="1292.html#1320qlink1"> &gt; Hey, are you saying transhumanism isn't rational? I wouldn't be on this</a><br>
<i> &gt; list if I didn't think it was. </i><br>

<p>
Transhumanism has a rational basis, but it also requires a strong 
imaginative ability to shift perspective away from internal concerns to 
discuss the broad scope of human evolution into posthumanity.  I would 
expect to find a lot of persons who combine both rational and creative 
aspects.

<p>
<a href="1292.html#1320qlink2"> &gt; Think about it, though, NT (the Rational type) was a foregone conclusion.</a><br>

<p>
All that has been illustrated (not yet proven) by this data is that NT 
types tend to congregate on internet listserves.  That might actually 
have some implications for issues related to computer mediated 
communication, but I don't know if that necessarily relates to transhumanism.
