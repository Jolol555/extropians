<a href="3443.html#3535qlink1">&gt;I have just finished watching George Soros ... a billionaire</a><br>
<i>&gt;speculator, who is also the world's most generous philanthropist.</i><br>
not sure about that point
<br>
<a href="3443.html#3535qlink2">&gt;He is a financial carnivore of the first water, and was said to be a</a><br>
<i>&gt;major factor in the recent Asian recession.</i><br>
unlikely in the extreme.

<p>
<a href="3443.html#3535qlink3">&gt;Soros is a man who says that the capitalist system is flawed.</a><br>
he came to this conclusion after taking a bath in russia.

<p>
<a href="3443.html#3535qlink4">&gt; He favors an approach called "open systems."</a><br>
menas open to him getting insurance against his speculations going bad. 
he essentially wants a one way trap door in his favour, guaranteed (as 
usual) by U&amp;me.

<p>
<i>&gt;I don't  have the expertise</i><br>
<a href="3443.html#3535qlink5">&gt;to assess his ideas fully (nor the time to acquire such expertise),</a><br>
too bad
<br>
<a href="3443.html#3535qlink6">&gt;but I like someone who says that all economic systems can be improved.</a><br>
??
<br>
<a href="3443.html#3535qlink7">&gt;Soros has been accused of socialism, but I do not think he is.</a><br>

<p>
Just out to get maximum loot

<p>
merry thing,
