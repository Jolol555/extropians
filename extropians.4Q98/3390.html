The purpose of a time span is to allow the inventor and his or her financial
backers to recoup a respectable return on investment on the capital needed to
bring the new technology to market. Its is merely a method of protecting
private investment in research and development, so the government doesn't have
to fund it all. Giving a patent a time span to earn ROI puts a tangible value
on an invention, whereas when it is not protected, a patent is only worth
something in the time between it intially comes to market and when the
competitor can backward engineer it to reproduce it and bring it to market.
When the time span to obsolescence decreases to a point where it is shorter
than the time required to reverse engineer something and bring it to market,
then patents will cease to have much value except as a means of retarding the
growth of competitors, and protecting the value of the new generation of
product from heavy discounting in the value of the previous obsolete
generation.
