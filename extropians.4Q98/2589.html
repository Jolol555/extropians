<p>
Assent to the Extropian Principles *is* what defines an Extropian, so if
someone disagrees significantly with the Principles but otherwise can
plausibly be called a transhumanist, there you have your difference. For
instance, one of the Extropian Principles is Open Society. Non-Extropian
transhumanists may want to collectively organize society and push it into
the future under the control of supposed experts (technocracy).

<p>
Many Extropians may believe that a consistent and effective commitment to
an Open Society and to the other principles implies libertarian, but this
need not be so, unless you want to use an exceedingly loose definition of
"libertarian". The term "libertarian" also comes along with a lot of
assumptions that may be untrue of many extropians, such as belief in
"natural rights", rejection of democracy in principle, opposition to
government provision of anything whatsoever, etc.

<p>
I think it would be counterproductive to require a commitment to
"libertarianism" -- however that was to be defined -- before one could be
called an Extropian. If we do that, shall we then decide whether you need
only be a minimal statist, or must you be an anarchist? What about an
anarchist who wants to run her personally owned community like an absolute
monarch?

<p>
In version 3.0 of the Principles, I've made it clearer what is crucial
about the Extropian view. The Principles are not there to push specific
beliefs. Libertarianism is a specific belief or set of beliefs about how
best to organize society. Some Extropians might believe that a system not
fairly called "libertarian" would actually do a better job of sustaining
and developing an open society--a society of progress and improvement. I'd
feel rather silly telling someone "You can't call yourself an Extropian
since you belief that government action is the only currently feasible
means of dealing with a genuine problem that affects practically everyone."

<p>
Obviously many system are incompatible with the Open Society principle. In
many cases it may be unclear, especially in dealing with issues of
transition from what we have to what we'd like to see. Is today's democracy
essential for maintaining an open society? Can we improve the democratic
process to make it better, even if we cannot abolish all taxes and
government control?
