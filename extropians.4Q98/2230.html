ive often thought pascal intended his conjecture as a little joke.  it takes a
special kind of "thinking" to allow one to choose ones belief.  i suspect
this is a special calculus that most on this list cannot do.

years ago, i stumbled upon this question "can one choose one's belief?"
the answers i got really surprised me.  most people said, yes, of course,
everyone does it, etc.  i pondered and concluded i have little if any
choice in what i believe.  i am weird.  {8^D  spike
