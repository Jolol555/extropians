<i>&gt; &gt;  y'all like the way the people's Republicans are cavortin' </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  w/impeachment in the Judiciary Committee and votin' ta rid us uv </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  that turpitudinous man we elected twice (after the wake-up mid-term </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  vote, even)?                                                               </i><br>

<i>&gt; I can't tolerate socialists (democrats) but I find Republicans little better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At least democrats are honest about what they intend to do....the republicans</i><br>
<i>&gt; lie about it prior to election and then vote like democrats after they get</i><br>
<i>&gt; elected.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which may explain the last election.  You notice that all the republicans who</i><br>
<i>&gt; lost were "moderates".  That is...they got caught in their lies and were voted</i><br>
<i>&gt; out. The staunch conservative republican incumbents had no trouble staying in</i><br>
<i>&gt; office.</i><br>

<p>
You need people ta tell you what you can and can't do w/yer weewee,
 and ta snoop on ya ta make sure yer towin' their line?  That's 
what the RepubliChristians'll give ya!  I sure's hell HOPE Clinton lied; 
it wuz- and iz- nunaour/theirfukkinbizness, OR Starr's!  Jeez; Guy 
can't even get a hummer in peace anymore, without zealous weazels 
tryin' ta saw yer jugular!  If Hillary (and 2/3 of the peepz)'r'willin' ta 
stick w/him, leave 'im in!  He may be a cad, but he's a Southern 
Gentleman cad, and, come hell er high water, he wasn't gonna tell (a 
gentleman NEVER does) until she did first.  What you call staunch, I 
call prurient, tyrannical and dictatorial (unresponsive to the manifest 
will'o'tha peeple).

<a href="2445.html#2446qlink2">&gt; Actually I beleive a lot of people just decided to drop out of the</a><br>
<i>&gt; process...there was no choice actually....in cases where the "choice was</i><br>
<i>&gt; either a "moderate republican" or democrat there was really NO choice...so</i><br>
<i>&gt; many just didn't bother to lend credibility to the process...they staid home.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then there was Jesse Ventura.  I wish I could have voted for him. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Regarding the impeachment process....my opinion is the same as it has been.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; want it to continue....he's guilty of purjury.  I heard it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've listened to the House Judiciary Committee proceedings for the last many</i><br>
<i>&gt; hours on PBS as I drive down the road.  What planet is Maxine Waters from?</i><br>
<i>&gt; And that "lady" representative from southern texas makes me ashamed of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; state.  "Drive the mars explorer over to the flag the astronauts left?"....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such is the quality of those who make decesions that affect our lives......</i><br>

You'll have your chance...Hulk Hogan's announced his candidacy in 
the Y2K Prezelection, campaigning as a member of Ross Perot's 
brood, jes' lak Jesse.
