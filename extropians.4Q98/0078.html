I'm assuming you're referring to the supposedly excessive use of a
certain _green_ herb in Amsterdam.  Some recent statistics I've seen,
however, suggest that usage in the Netherlands for 'natives' is
comparable to other European countries.  Although the stats didn't
mention Amsterdam, I'd imagine a similar story.  In fact, most of it is
apparently used by foreigners, due to the novelty of being able to use it
lawfully.  Consequently, I doubt  there is a strong connection.
