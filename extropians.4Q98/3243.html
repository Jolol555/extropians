Since I enjoyed the Singularity version of the Monty Python parrot sketch
so much, and since 'tis the season to be jolly, tra la la la, la la la la
[out damn meme!], here's a joke originally posted by QueenMuse:

<p>
WHY GOD NEVER RECEIVED A JOB AT (Fill in the name of your local college).


<OL>
  <li>  He had only one major publication. 
  <li>  It was in Greek and Hebrew. 
  <li>  It had no references. 
  <li>  It wasn't published in a refereed journal. 
  <li>  Some even doubt he wrote it by himself. 
  <li>  It may be true that he created the world, but what has he done 
since then? 
  <li>  No record of working well with colleagues. 
  <li>  The scientific community has had a hard time replicating his results. 
  <li>  He never applied to the ethics board for permission to use human subjects. 
  <li>  When one experiment went awry he tried to cover it by drowning his
subjects. 
  <li>  When subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them from the
sample. 
  <li>  He rarely came to class, just told students to read the book. 
  <li>  Some say he had his son teach the class. 
  <li>  He expelled his first two students for learning. 
  <li>  Although there were only 10 requirements, most of his students failed
his tests. 
  <li>  His office hours were infrequent and often held on limited access
mountain tops.
