It isn't possible according to our current scientific understanding, and
as Drexler explains, you can't predict *scientific* progress, so we'll
have to contend ourselves with the lightspeed limit in rational
discourse.

<a href="2276.html#2402qlink2">&gt; One of the things that always bugged me about travelling sub-light</a><br>

<p>
As you noticed, that isn't really a problem in itself--besides, the
universe doesn't give a damn whether we like its laws--but only due to
limitations of our bodies. Let's face it, homo sapiens is ill-adapted
for space travel. We are too short-lived, we can't go easily into
suspension, we could use better resistance against radiation, etc.

<p>
I think interstellar travel with present-day humans, as taken for
granted as a convention by much of the ScF genre, is a pretty silly and
unrealistic idea. If we're going to the stars, it will be either a much
changed version of us or our mind children. Watery meat bags it ain't
gonna be.

<p>
<a href="2276.html#2402qlink3">&gt; I'm wondering if a human were to have lived a few hundred thousand</a><br>
<i>&gt; years, how much of a pain would it be to travel between the stars at</i><br>
<i>&gt; sub-light speeds.</i><br>

<p>
Assuming a scenario of uploading into some convenient technology, why
should it be a pain? If you can't occupy yourself for a few years
(decades, centuries, millennia, ...), just go into suspension. Sleep.
Personally, I have a lot of things to catch up on.

<p>
<a href="2276.html#2402qlink4">&gt; In other words, 500,000 years from now when I decide to travel to Star</a><br>

<i>&gt; get to (conservatively of course), will I bother getting bored?</i><br>

<p>
If you allow yourself to get bored, it's your very own fault.

<p>
<a href="2276.html#2402qlink5">&gt; My question is, would 3,000 years feel like just a couple of months to</a><br>
<i>&gt; a being more than a half-million years old?  Is there any way to know?  </i><br>

<p>
I guess this is a general question, that isn't really related to
interstellar travel at all.

<p>
I dunno. How could *we* know?
