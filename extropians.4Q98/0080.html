 IAN: The 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse [1] found 
 that of Americans age 12 and above, approximately 34% had used 
 cannabis ever, 9% had in the last year, and 4.3% had in the last 
 week. The NHSDA for 1998 [2] finds that 5.1% 12 years and over 
 used in the last month (no cite for last week in press release). 

<p>
 In Holland, the Ministry of Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs 
 found that of residents of Amsterdam ages 12 and over, 25% ever 
 used cannabis, 9.9% did in the last year and 6% did in the last 
 week.[3] When we consider that people in the U.S., unlike those 
 in Amsterdam, will under report current use (criminal activity) 
 for obvious reasons, I think we can conclude that there's not 
 much statistical support for the theory you seem to suggest. 

<p>
 Also consider that in Amsterdam a whopping 42.7% had smoked 
 tobacco in the last week [3], and yet in the U.S. only 30%
 of all people 12 years and over are tobacco users. [2]

 BTW, J, did you see those questions I asked about zero?
