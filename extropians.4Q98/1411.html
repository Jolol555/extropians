<a href="1397.html#1411qlink1">&gt;For example, height. Males are on average</a><br>
<i>&gt;slightly taller than females. But if I were to tell you</i><br>
<i>&gt;"You will shortly meet two people. One is a native Thai adult male,</i><br>
<i>&gt;raised in Thailand. The other is a native Masai woman, raised in East</i><br>
<i>&gt;Africa". &gt;You would lose money (on average) betting that the male will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;taller. Other</i><br>
<i>&gt;factors swamp the gender bias.</i><br>

<p>
Interestingly it has been recently shown that 70% of the variation in
height is accounted for by ONE gene held on the X chromosome. Which
explains why XXX or XXY people are taller than average.

<p>
Sorry for the vagueness of the above: this is from memory from a report I
read in New Scientist a few weeks ago. If someone has better details please
post them, obviously its was a great surprise to find that one gene
accounted for so much variation.

<p>
best, patrick
