<p>
McDonald's (the fried rat chain) sued a small business (also called
McDonald's, also in the fast food line, also established for quite a
few years) not far from here a while back.  The big mega- corporation
got its day in court -- and was told to fuck right off by the court.

<p>
Seems they don't have a monopoly on the name -- at least, not here</a> in
Scotland.

<a name="3325qlink2">As a further aside, it's worth noting the "use it or lose it" aspect
of current trademark law. A hoover is a generic vacuum cleaner; a kleenex
is a generic paper hendkerchief. A xerox is a photocopier. They failed
to stop the words entering common usage and they've effectively become
generic -- not so generic that you can get away with calling your new
photocopier range 'xerox machines', but not far from it.
