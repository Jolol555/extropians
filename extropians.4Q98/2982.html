This Christmas will be the last Christmas Harold and 
Iris Stone spend in the home in which they raised two 
daughters and accumulated four decades of cherished 
holiday memories.  That's because the Stones will soon 
be evicted, thanks to the city of Lynn, Massachusetts.

<p>
The Stones' sad story is but one example of how 
government regulation can wound innocent Americans - 
Americans who thought that, if they worked hard and 
played by the rules, they would reap the rewards. 

<p>
The Stones' tragic story began in 1985, when Harold 
and Iris decided to sell the auto repair business the 
couple had operated for 40 years.  Their plan was 
simple: by selling the business they would have the 
money to pay off their mortgage, retire some business 
debts and have enough left over to enjoy their golden 
years.

<p>
But Lynn city officials had other plans.  The city 
wanted to turn their property into a condominium 
development.  To do so, officials coerced the Stones 
into selling their business to a favored developer for 
$400,000, at least $325,000 below the property's 
actual value.  City planners were so determined to 
pressure the Stones into the unfavorable sale that 
they resorted to using what the local press later 
called "an illegal zoning ordinance" to scare off 
potential buyers who offered higher bids.  The 
developer was supposed to pay the Stones full market 
value, but went bankrupt soon after the purchase - 
leaving the couple with nothing for retirement.  They 
used all of the $400,000 to pay 
<br>
off their mortgage and debts.

<p>
In 1989, the Stones decided to repurchase their 
property.  A real estate boom was in progress, and 
they hoped they could resell the property for a 
significant profit.  The Stones borrowed $500,000 for 
the repurchase and were soon getting very attractive 
offers from interested buyers.  A car dealer offered 
the couple $920,000, which would have been enough to 
pay off the bank loan and still have plenty for 
retirement.

<p>
But then the city stepped in and sabotaged the deal.  
The city also sabotaged every subsequent deal the 
Stones arranged.  To ward off potential buyers, the 
city cut off water to the Stones' buildings and 
eliminated the curb cuts to make the property 
inaccessible.  The city argued that these tactics were 
necessary to ensure that any buyers would go along 
with the city's desire to convert the land to nonindustrial
 uses.  But the city's subsequent behavior 
puts this claim in doubt.  Shortly after the bank 
foreclosed on the Stones' business property in 1992, 
the city allowed a furniture warehouse to buy the 
property.

<p>
The Stones took their case to court and years of 
litigation followed.  Although a jury awarded the 
couple $720,000 in 1995, the City of Lynn got the 
decision reversed on appeal.  Desperate to avoid 
bankruptcy, the Stones then took their case to the 
U.S. Supreme Court early this year.  But the High 
Court, as it must with most cases, declined to hear 
the case.

<p>
The bank foreclosed on the Stones' home this summer, 
and the couple is now waiting for the final order to 
leave.

<p>
Iris says she and Harold are confident they can stay 
in the house through the Christmas holidays, but notes 
that it is not going to be a joyful occasion.  The 
Stones' daughters and close friends will come to 
celebrate the holiday.  But Iris says she doesn't have 
the stamina to enjoy Christmas the way she used to.  
She used to love to cook holiday dishes and bake pies.  
Now, Iris says, she simply doesn't have any appetite.  
She finds it hard to even sleep and often experiences 
panic attacks. 

<p>
 "I never for a moment believed the government would 
do to us what they did.  I mean, this is America," 
said Iris.  "You think that if you work hard, buy a 
home and live a good life, you've at least earned the 
right to keep it and not have your own government come 
and take it away."

<p>
But there's one thing government will never be able to 
take away from the Stones: the memory of 40 
Christmases in their beloved home.  The Stones will 
never forget the look on their daughters' faces when 
they got their first bicycles on Christmas Day or that 
very special Christmas many years ago when Harold gave 
Iris a watch with a touching card, "To the Goddess of 
Beauty, here is the Goddess of Time." 

<p>
With eviction imminent, this Christmas may be the one 
Christmas the Stones try to forget.
