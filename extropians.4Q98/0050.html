Some eye-opening analysis quoted from the report "Berlin 
Tribunal" at this page: <a href="http://www.rath.nl/GB/hot1.htm">http://www.rath.nl/GB/hot1.htm</a> 


<p>
Throughout the 20th century the pharmaceutical 
industry was built and organized with the goal 
to control the health care system of nations by 
systematically replacing natural, non-patentable 
therapies with patentable and therefore profitable
synthetic drugs. The architects of the pharmaceutical 
industry were unscrupulous entrepreneurs and financiers 
who, from the very beginning of this industry, had defined
the human body and the diseases it hosts as their marketplace.

<p>
As the result of the systematic take-over of the health care 
system by nationally and internationally operating pharmaceutical
 corporations billions of people in almost all countries 
of the United Nations have been paying trillions of dollars 
for pharmaceutical drugs that neither prevent diseases nor 
cure them. The governments, the economic and social sectors 
of all industrialized countries are currently held hostage 
by the ill-conceived and criminal practices of 
pharmaceutical corporations.

<p>
A particular example is the Federal Republic of Germany, 
the leading export nation of such pharmaceutical products 
in the world. Throughout the 20 th century, the German 
pharmaceutical corporations Hoechst, Bayer and BASF have 
determined the fate not only of that country but of the
entire world. In an effort to control the global chemical 
and pharmaceutical markets, these corporations formed the 
IG Farben Cartel already at the beginning of this century, 
sponsored the rise of Hitler to power and were the driving 
economic force behind the Second World War and Hitler's
effort to conquer the world. Hoechst, Bayer and BASF were 
the organizers of the giant industrial plant IG Auschwitz 
using as their forced labor camp the Concentration Camp 
Auschwitz, the largest crime site of human history.

<p>
At the 1947 Nuremberg Tribunal 24 of the managers of 
Hoechst, Bayer and BASF and other IG Farben executives 
were accused of the following crimes against humanity:

<p>
  planning and leading the war

<p>
  mass murder

<p>
  conducting criminal experiments on
<br>
  innocent inmates of concentration camps

<p>
  grand theft and plundering

<p>
  slavery and other crimes.

<p>
The US lead prosecutor Telford Taylor said in the Nuremberg 
Tribunal against these IG Farben executives: "Not the Nazi 
lunatics but these accused are responsible for this war. 
And if they are not punished for these crimes the harm 
they will do to future generations is much greater than 
Hitler could ever have done if he were alive."

<p>
The IG Farben Cartel was dismantled and split by the 
Nuremberg Tribunal into the daughter companies Hoechst, 
Bayer and BASF. With the help of Nelson Rockefeller, their 
former business partner and US Undersecretary of State after 
the war, all convicted IG Farben managers were released from 
prison already in 1952 and reassumed positions in the highest 
levels of German industry.

<p>
The prediction of Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor Taylor soon 
became true. In post-war Germany the positions of chairmen of 
Hoechst, Bayer and BASF were held by war-time IG Farben directors
 and former members of the Nazi party for over a quarter
of a century after the second world war.

<p>
Hoechst, Bayer and BASF lost no time to build up other political 
leaders to serve their interests in post-war Germany. Between
1959 and 1969 Helmut Kohl worked for the "Verband der Chemischen
Industrie" (Association of Chemical Industry), the largest lobby 
organization of the chemical-pharmaceutical industry. This industry
 systematically promoted Helmut Kohl&amp;rsquo;s political 
career thereby continuing to instrumentalize the German 
government for their global expansion plans. And their
investment paid out. Now, fifty years after the Nuremberg 
Tribunal split the criminal IG Farben Cartel into Hoechst, 
Bayer and BASF each of these three daughter companies is 20 
times larger than the IG Farben empire ever was. Today, these 
IG Farben successors are the largest exporters of pharmaceutical 
products in the world, maintaining an industrial network over 120
countries of the world.

<p>
For almost two decades, Helmut Kohl has been heading the German 
government. During this time the government of Germany became the 
political spearhead of the global conquest of the pharmaceutical
industry and of the world-wide genocide and mass murder committed 
on their behalf. The criminal role of the pharmaceutical corporations
 and the German government becomes particularly evident by 
the effort to suppress one of the greatest advances in medicine, 
which will lead to the elimination of heart disease.

<p>
The discovery that vitamins and other essential nutrients are the 
answer to the most common health problems of our time marked not 
only a turning point in medicine but it immediately threatened 
the very existence of the pharmaceutical industry.

<p>
The global pharmaceutical market of cardiovascular drugs alone 
is in excess of several hundred million dollars every year and 
the single largest segment of the global drug market. In order 
to artificially stabilize their global pharmaceutical drug market 
the pharmaceutical corporations now formed an international Pharma-
 This Pharma-Cartel organizes a global campaign to systematically
 obstruct, suppress the dissemination of the life-saving 
information of this medical breakthrough and to publicly discredit 
the health benefits of vitamins and other natural remedies.

<p>
Between 1991 and 1994 and as a direct reaction to Dr. Rath's 
discoveries, the Pharma-Cartel tried to make vitamins and other 
essential nutrients prescription drugs in the US, their single 
largest national market. The pretenses under which the Pharma-
 promoted their legislative plan, "consumer protection" 
from non-existing side-effects and "international harmonization" 
to adapt inadequately low daily nutritional recommendations, 
were false and deceptive. However the statistical facts uncovered
 the deception of the Pharma-Cartel and showed that 
in the last ten years no American had died from side effects 
of vitamins and other essential nutrients. Supported by millions 
of Americans, US Congress unanimously passed the Dietary Supplement 
Health and Education Act of 1994, which secured unrestricted access 
to nutritional supplements.
