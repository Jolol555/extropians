<p>
I don't see how "From each according to his abilities, to each according
to his needs" means that everyone has equal needs.  I think it just
<a name="2405qlink2">means that needs should be met, but does not say anything about the size
of these needs.</a>

A communist state is an oxymoron since the state is meant to wither away
