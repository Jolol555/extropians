<i>&gt;From a newspaper contest where entrants age 4 to 15</i><br>
were asked to imitate "Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey."

<hr>

<p>
My young brother asked me what happens after we die. I told him we get
buried under a bunch of dirt and worms eat our bodies. I guess I should=

<p>
have told him the truth-that most of us go to Hell and burn
eternally-but I didn't want to upset him. -- Age 10

<p>
When I go to heaven, I want to see my grandpa again. But he better have=

<p>
lost the nose hair and the old-man smell. -- Age 5

<p>
I once heard the voice of God. It said "Vrrrrmmmmm." Unless it was
just a lawn mower. -- Age 11

<p>
I don't know about you, but I enjoy watching paint dry. I imagine that
the wet paint is a big freshwater lake that is the only source of water=

<p>
for some tiny cities by the lake. As the lake gets drier, the populatio=
n
<br>
gets more desperate, and sometimes there are water riots. Once there wa=
s
<br>
a big fire and everyone died. -- Age 13

<p>
I believe you should live each day as if it is your last, which is why =
I
<br>
don't have any clean laundry because, come on, who wants to wash clothe=
s
<br>
on the last day of their life? -- Age 15

<p>
Whenever I start getting sad about where I am in my life, I think about=

<p>
the last words of my favorite uncle: "A truck!" -- Age 15

<p>
It sure would be nice if we got a day off for the president's
birthday, like they do for the queen. Of course, then we would have
a lot of people voting for a candidate born on July 3 or December
26, just for the long weekends. -- Age 8

<p>
As you make your way through this hectic world of ours, set aside a few=

<p>
minutes each day. At the end of the year, you'll have a couple of days
saved up. -- Age 7

<p>
Democracy is a beautiful thing, except for that part about letting just=

<p>
any old yokel vote. -- Age 10

<p>
Home is where the house is. -- Age 6

<p>
Often, when I am reading a good book, I stop and thank my teacher.
That is, I used to, until she got an unlisted number. -- Age 15

<p>
It would be terrible if the Red Cross Bloodmobile got into an
accident. No, wait. That would be good because if anyone needed it,
the blood would be right there. -- Age 5

<p>
Give me the strength to change the things I can, the grace to accept th=
e
<br>
things I cannot, and a great big bag of money. -- Age 13

<p>
The people who think Tiny Tim is strange are the same ones who think it=

<p>
odd that I drive without pants. -- Age 15

<p>
I bet living in a nudist colony takes all the fun out of Halloween. --
Age 13

<p>
For centuries, people thought the moon was made of green cheese. Then
the astronauts found that the moon is really a big hard rock. That's
what happens to cheese when you leave it out. -- Age 6

<p>
Think of the biggest number you can.=A0 Now add five. Then, imagine if
you had that many Twinkies. Wow, that's five more than the biggest
number you could come up with! -- Age 6

<p>
The only stupid question is the one that is never asked, except maybe
"Don't you think it is about time you audited my return?" or "Isn't it
morally wrong to give me a warning when, in fact, I was speeding?" --
Age 15

<p>
Once, I wept for I had no shoes. Then I came upon a man who had no feet=
.
<br>
So I took his shoes. I mean, it's not like he really needed them, right=
?
<br>
-- Age 15

<p>
I often wonder how come John Tesh isn't as popular a singer as some
people think he should be. Then I remember it's because he sucks. -- Ag=
e
<br>
15

<p>
I gaze at the brilliant full moon. The same one, I think to myself, at
which Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato gazed. Suddenly, I imagine they
appear beside me. I tell Socrates about the national debate over one's
right to die and wonder at the constancy of the human condition. I tell=

<p>
Plato that I live in the country that has come the closest to Utopia,
and I show him a copy of the Constitution. I tell Aristotle that we
have found many more than four basic elements and I show him a periodic=

<p>
table. I get a box of kitchen matches and strike one. They gasp with
wonder. We spend the rest of the night lighting farts. -- Age 15

<p>
If we could just get everyone to close their eyes and visualize world
peace for an hour, imagine how serene and quiet it would be until the
looting started. -- Age 15
