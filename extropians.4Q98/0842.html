MEMS key signature signed wireless packets make for a great broadband 
infrastructure, but eventually, for security purposes, it may be 
necessary to have lots and lots and lots of fiber to support the 
computing infrastructure necessary to simulate real systems with 
atomic precision.

If the Earth is Federalized and each citizen is awarded a paperless 
allowance of the U.S. equivalent of $58,000/year, what incentive is

labor caste, I'd imagine.  What sorts of problems would this cause or 
solve?
