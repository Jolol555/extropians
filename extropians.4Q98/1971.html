An important recent study by the British Home Office concluded that
something like 80% of the people in prisons in the UK for non-drug-related
crimes had serious learning difficulties -- dyslexia was very common. They
conducted a trial of basic literacy classes, and were astonished to
discover a two-thirds drop in recidivism among prisoners who they taught
to read. Given the cost of keeping people in prison that strikes me
as being an extremely cost-effective treatment! While it's obviously
not a global panacea, it got enough interest that the Home Office --
who for the past few years have been tending towards the American "lock
'em up and keep 'em in prison" penal pattern -- has begun looking into
extended trials of this type.

<p>
(A possible mechanism which suggests itself is that today's society is
literacy-oriented; if you can't fill out forms at the DSS office you
can't get any social security support, if you can't fill out forms you
can't get a bank account, if you can't fill out forms you can't get
a job. If illiteracy is a major impediment to life in civil society,
it is not unreasonable to expect some illiterate people to turn to less
formal means of supporting themselves. If this _is_ a major cause of crime,
then we can actually do a lot of crime prevention work in primary school,
and massively improve the recidivism rate for those people who end up in
prison.)

<a name="2002qlink1">As a side-issue, I seem to recall that South Africa was a television-free
zone until comparatively recently -- 1976 springs to mind -- and when
TV appeared, the crime rate doubled within a decade. Anyone else recall
any figures of this kind? Any association between TV uptake, declines
in literacy, and increasing crime rates welcome ...
