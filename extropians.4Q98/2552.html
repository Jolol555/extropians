Abstract
<br>
  Treatment with pineal peptide preparation epithalamin was followed by the
  increase of the mean lifespan of female D. melanogaster, SHR mice, C3H/Sn
  mice and LIO rats by 11-31% (P &lt; 0.05). Ninety percent mortality as well as
  maximum lifespan were increased in fruit flies, C3H/Sn mice and rats.
  Mortality rate was decreased by 52% in D. melanogaster, by 52% in rats, by
  27% in C3H/Sn mice. It did not change in SHR mice exposed to epithalamin.
  Treatment with the pineal peptide increased MRDT in flies, C3H/Sn mice and
  rats. It has been shown that epithalamin increased synthesis and secretion of
  melatonin in rats and inhibits free radical processes in rats and in D.
  melanogaster. It is suggested that antioxidative properties of epithalamin
  lead to increased lifespan of three different animal species.
