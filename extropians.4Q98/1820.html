<a href="1801.html#1820qlink1">&gt;Well, it is true that many of society's problems are caused by parents</a><br>
<i>&gt;abusing their kids. In fact, afaik, child abuse is a much bigger problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;than all other crimes combined. Of course it doesn't explain *all* criminal</i><br>
<i>&gt;activity, as some criminals are simply "born evil" and some crimes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;fairly rational or due to circumstance. Nevertheless, solving the problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;of child abuse should be high on every government's agenda (for various</i><br>
<i>&gt;practical and "moral" reasons).</i><br>

<p>
Right spot on, den; and thanks for the reinforcement. I think this merits a
place on Extropian agendas as well.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1801.html#1820qlink2">&gt;How to deal with it?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;a) Compulsory psychological screening and parenting tests for everyone who</i><br>
wants
<br>
<a href="1801.html#1820qlink3">&gt;children (let them care for a very annoying "automatic" baby that has,</a><br>
<i>&gt;em, full bodily functions etc. for about a month. That should put off most</i><br>
<i>&gt;unprepared parents).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;b) No children if you can't support them financially (abuse is especially</i><br>
<i>&gt;rampant in poor families. Everyone's frustrated (nothing gets people more</i><br>
<i>&gt;on edge than financial problems, as I know from personal experience),</i><br>
<i>&gt;the parents are often drunks, the father beats the kids and his wife</i><br>
<i>&gt;because he's a dumb, frustrated asshole etc. You know the picture...)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ironically, those that can least afford it often have the most children.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;c) A special police service for abuse victims: if you're being abused</i><br>
<i>&gt;at home (or any other place for that matter), the police will install a</i><br>
<i>&gt;domestic surveillance system without the abuser's knowledge and</i><br>
<i>&gt;monitor the situation. Evidence gathered in this way will be used in</i><br>
<i>&gt;court. Incidentally, the monitoring service can also be installed if</i><br>
<i>&gt;others (such as doctors, friends of the alleged victim, school officials)</i><br>
<i>&gt;point out a household as potentially abusive).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;d) Tough punishments for abusers (jail time and corporal punishment).</i><br>
<i>&gt;After jail (or in the case of minor abuse after a stern warning/fine)</i><br>
<i>&gt;permanent installment of cameras in the offender's house, as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;preventive measure and to serve as evidence should abuse reoccur.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The victim gets a personal alarm, which summons the police (after</i><br>
<i>&gt;checking via integral phone and the cam system). In a libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenario, this would be a PPA (but, how does a kid pay a PPA?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Uh-huh!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;e) In more severe cases the victim would be placed in a special</i><br>
<i>&gt;caring center (with varying degrees of independence according to</i><br>
<i>&gt;age, but generally speaking a lot of freedom, according to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;golden rule). Separate living quarters for everyone, of course full</i><br>
<i>&gt;surveillance (appartment surveillance is optional, not compulsory)</i><br>
<i>&gt;to prevent any abuse or other irregularities by staff (strict selection,</i><br>
<i>&gt;few or no men) or other occupants. The general feel should be that</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a vacation resort or a hotel, *not* a (pedophile &amp; fascist-ridden )</i><br>
<i>&gt;prison. Education is, of course, "transhuman style", with a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;emphasis on rational thinking, personal empowerment etc. Multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt;generations of rational, law-abiding and progressive individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt;would likely be the pleasant (side-) effect of the anti-abuse program.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;f) Of course, the abusers (should they ever get out of jail) would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be slapped with a perpetual restraining order, to be enforced by</i><br>
<i>&gt;an electronic ankle bracelet (or something more sophisticated).</i><br>
<i>&gt;The former victim gets a receiver that goes off whenever the</i><br>
<i>&gt;abuser gets within the "forbidden" (1 mile for ex.) radius. Of course</i><br>
<i>&gt;the police also get a beep. Should the abuser somehow manage</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do harm to the victim anyway (or abuse someone else), he</i><br>
<i>&gt;goes to jail (labor camp) for life (or at least a *long* time). Should</i><br>
<i>&gt;he kill his victim, he is to be executed in a most unpleasant way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;g) It goes without saying that known abusers are *never ever*</i><br>
<i>&gt;allowed to have kids (again).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>


<p>
All your recommendations seem reasonable, rational, and eminently pragmatic.
In addition, it seems clear that uploading for any who carry memes of
dysfunctional parenting ought not to occur. --J. R.
