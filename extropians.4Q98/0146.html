Indeed, I did not use the term "centralized allocation system" in the
Principles 3.0. I mentioned that in a commentary here on the list. Thanks
to the perceptive comments I received on the first draft, I have been
thinking hard about just what the Principles should say about
social/economic orders. I do want them to clearly stand against any
centralized, authoritarian system that disallows experimentation. A
Stalinist transhumanism is *not* compatible with the Extropian Principles.

<p>
Although I do believe that markets in some form or another are usually the
best way of organizing things today and probably for quite a while to come,
I no longer want to make that an essential part of the principles. For
instance, I certainly want the Principles to be compatible with J. Maxwell
Legg's proposed system. A moneyless allocation system, if it could be made
to work, would be perfectly compatible. Any other changes in the economic
order that preserve freedom, experimentation, and improvement are compatible. 

<p>
Although some people (not you, Maxwell) seem intent on portraying me as a
defender of today's institutions despite what I have written, I have no
problem with finding a way to free people from dependence on working for
others. I think far more people could do this *now*, not in some
theoretical future, if they restricted consumption and invested until they
could live off investment income. After that, you're free to take or refuse
any work without worrying about paying the bills.

<p>
<a name="0148qlink1">These considerations have led me to drop "Spontaneous Orders" and any talk
of markets as fundamental. I am currently working on replacing this
principle with one called "Open Society". I will be posting it for comment
once I complete a draft. Maxwell, I will be particularly interested in your
comments on this replacement principle. I think you'll find it completely
compatible with your goals.</a>

<p>
Onward!
