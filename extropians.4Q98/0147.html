<p>
<a name="0157qlink1">Discussion has begun about the organization and format</a> for EXTRO4, the next 
general gathering of transhumanists to be sponsored by Extropy Institute. 
We'd like to get input from as many sources as possible in the early planning 
stages. The following is a list of topics for discussion in this process, and 
some thoughts that have already been discussed off-list on those topics:

<p>
FORMAT
<br>
Based on feedback we've gotten on last year's EXTRO3, the leading idea so far 
for the format for EXTRO4 is a more open-ended, spontaneous gathering, with 
more unstructured time and opportunities for brainstorming and networking. 
We're considering definition of a small group (no more than three or four) of 
subject matter areas. "Central" talks and/or panel presentations and 
discussions in these areas would be one aspect of the gathering, with 
associated smaller discussion groups and "sub-presentations" taking place to 
compliment the central events.

<p>
To ease the burden of organizing the conference, we're looking for
individuals 
<br>
or small groups to work largely on their own, but with assistance from the 
conference Chair to develop material for the separate subject matter areas. 
People with specialized knowledge, contacts or interests connected to these 
subject matter areas will work together within a fairly loose over-all 
organizational framework to develop content for these separate areas.

<p>
SUBJECT MATTER
<br>
Initial discussions I've had have centered on the following areas:

<p>
(1) The Business of the Future. (Start-ups, investing in technology, <br>
business opportunities.) 
<br>
(2) 21st Century Social Orders. (Covering economics, law, and politics.) <br>
(3) Memetic Dissemination/Marketing Transhumanism. (How to communicate more <br>
effectively, tackle common objections in particular areas.) 
<br>
(4) Practical Life Extension. (Presentations on the most effective means of <br>
extending life today and maybe current research, including the latest on 
cryopreservation.)

<p>
PLACE
<br>
Many people have expressed a preference for Northern California. Another 
preference is somewhere in the Rocky Mountains or desert West, as potentially 
easier (and less expensive) to reach for folks who aren't based on the West 
Coast.

<p>
TIME
<br>
<a name="0157qlink2">August, 1997 worked well for EXTRO3 and August, 1999 is our current 
working assumption for a general time-frame. It is important that we get 
feedback on good weekends early on, so please let us know as soon 
as possible what</a> times 

<p>
are good and bad for you. In particular we'd like to know about competing 
events that could create scheduling conflicts.

<p>
It's important that we decide on place and time for the gathering before the 
end of the year so that we can start negotiating for a conference venue and 
begin publicizing the event, so I would appreciate feedback on this as a
first 
<br>
priority.

<p>
Thank you, 
<br>
Greg Burch and Max More.

<p>
Please send your feedback either to the list for discussion, or to 
conference Chair Max More at &lt;more@extropy.org&gt;
