<i>&gt; From: "John Clark" &lt;jonkc@worldnet.att.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Genes and a low calorie diet</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0213.html#0215qlink1">&gt; The other interesting thing is that the Dave-2 gene in humans makes a</a><br>
<i>&gt; receptor for insulin and a growth factor called IGF that's deeply involved</i><br>
<i>&gt; in food metabolism. The mutated roundworms eat a normal diet but their</i><br>
<i>&gt; metabolism is similar to an unmutated roundworm on a very low calorie diet.</i><br>

<p>
Interesting...  I'm not surprised that this link between
aging and insulin has been discovered.  I've been on a low
carb diet for some time now, and the theory behind low carb
diets is to counteract Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IR).  

<p>
According to the theory, high carb foods such as grains and
sugar, were not available to primitive man, so are bodies
are not equipped to properly deal with them. And by
repeatedly shocking our system with high carb foods, we
cause our bodies to produce very high levels of insulin. 
And as our bodies become accustom to high levels of insulin,
the insulin receptors in the cells of our bodies become
Insulin Resistant.  So the level of insulin required for
insulin to do its job, progressively becomes higher and
higher.

<p>
This obviously creates all kinds of havoc with our food
metabolism.  It creates a condition where the non insulin
resistant cells of our body (fat cells &amp; cancer cells), hog
all the blood sugar in our body before our brains and
muscles get a chance.  Thus we grow fatter while
paradoxically, experiencing low energy.  

<p>
But high insulin levels cause all kinds of other problems
besides weight gain.  To begin with, insulin suppresses
Human Growth Hormone levels, while causing the amount of
cholesterol the body produces to sky rocket.  High insulin
levels can also cause high blood pressure, elevated
triglycerides, and type II diabetes.

<p>
<a href="0213.html#0215qlink2">&gt; A low calorie diet has extended the life span of every animal it has been</a><br>
<i>&gt; tested on.</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps the reason why a low calorie diet is effective, is
because it is one way of controlling insulin levels.
