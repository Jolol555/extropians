<p>
<a href="2301.html#2313qlink3">&gt;Perhaps you should clarify why this is exactly gibberish. </a><br>

<p>
As Joe mentioned, because, well, um, actually we *don't* have pre-packaged
cerebral modules waiting for an extraterrestrial habitus to activate them,
and certainly evolution doesn't work in such a way as to manufacture such
brain gadgets providentially.<a name="2334qlink1">  But what I was complaining about seems to me
so self-evident I hesitate to spell it out.  The right lobe of the brain
*isn't* either `silent' or `inactive'.  Take a look at CAT scans, PET
scans, or olde worlde EEG traces known to the ancients long before Doc
Leary had his first white light flash.</a>  You might as well cite a document
claiming that the human male left testicle is `immobile' or `inactive'.
Anyone making such a claim, even as a kind of zoned-out metaphor, trips my
bogosity meter *big* time.

<p>
<a href="2301.html#2313qlink4">&gt;Since you seem to be suggesting that models of intelligence positing the</a><br>
<i>&gt;existence of brain states beyond the conventional linear styles of thinking</i><br>

<p>
I'm not suggesting that.  Most brain states have nothing to do with
thinking, linear or otherwise (whatever that means).
