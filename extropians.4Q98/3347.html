As others have already pointed out, a clone is not going to be any more like
you than an identical twin - probably less so, since she will be raised by
different parents in a different environment.  If you are looking for a way
to 'build the perfect mate', in the classic mad-scientist tradition, you are
going to have to wait a long time.  You would need a technology capable of
designing personalities the way we currently write software, not to mention
a reliable way to figure out what personality you would be most compatible
with.  Given the dismal state of modern psychology, that will probably not
be possible anytime soon.

<p>
If you really can't be satisfied with the options the gene pool provides,
you are better off looking for an extropian partner.  Significant
self-modification should become possible over the next two decades, and a
loving partner should be willing to accommodate your desires to a certain
extent.  Of course, she'll probably have some requests of her own...
