I attempted to send a message to the Extropy mailing list about a new 
book I read. To my surprise the message was never distributed on the 
list. Instead, I received my email back from my mail server with this 
header:

<p>
<a name="0116qlink2">&lt;extropians@extropy.com&gt;:Connected to 207.228.101.114 but sender was 
rejected.
<br>
Remote host said: 550 &lt;extrogod@hotmail.com&gt;... You are not welcome 
here.
</a>

<p>
What did I do to deserve this draconian measure? On October 1st, I made 
a post in response to Michael Lorrey's "anti-spam strategy" post that 
did not violate any of the list's guidelines. But yet I'm blocked from 
posting to the list under my normal email address.

<p>
Maybe this is a backlash from my earlier posts in August where I exposed 
Max More as being hypocritical with his personal attacks towards me. I 
also identified that posts of Erik Moeller's had been deleted from the 
archive, a fact confirmed by other members, however, immediately after 
my post the archive 'mysteriously disappeared' and when it returned a 
day later, Erik's posts were back. When you sport a view that conflicts 
with Max More's point-of-view, prepared to be censored or at least 
driven from the list (for example, Erik Moeller).

<p>
What about Nicholas Bostrom? He posted to this list and said "I have 
evidence indicating that the rumor about the censored post was started 
by someone who is explicitly out there to harm the ExI. I can't disclose 
this evidence since it was confided to me in a private email. But let's 
all simply ignore this rumor." This turned out to be a false statement. 
No apologies were made to me. Nicholas Bostrom continues to be allowed 
to post to this list. His outright lie and slander of me was far more 
serious than my lack of tact in phrasing my comments. Where is the 
objective rational approach in this case?

<p>
Ironically, Max More makes a post today about a free society publication 
yet he supports the subjective and biased censorship of a list member! 
What is worse, I am a paying member of the Extropy Institute!

<p>
<a name="0116qlink1">I am beginning to think Erik Moeller was right. Transhumanism is a noble 
movement with many bright minds. But the Extropy Institute is a biased 
cultish institution that squashes anyone who disagrees publically with 
its leader, Max More.</a>
