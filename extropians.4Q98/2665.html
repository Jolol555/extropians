<p>
It's hard to say since all I have to go on are the postings to this list,
but I suspect that Extropians, as a group, possess many attributes
commonly observed among those who are considered to be
"well-adapted". First, they appear to place a high premium on
rationality.  Second, they appear to have a healthy "tolerance for
ambiguity".  I believe these two attributes form the foundation for
what I call "psychological resilience".  I'm actually not so sure that
this group is highly adaptive in the social domain.  Partly due to the
fringe nature of the ideas promulgated herein, and partly due to the
strongly individualistic philosophies espoused. I could be and often
am wrong though.

<a href="2649.html#2665qlink3">&gt;I'm a "genius" as defined by my &gt;=98th percentile scores on certain</a><br>

<p>
I just barely qualified for Mensa based on my GRE scores and I think my Full
Scale WAIS IQ score was around 128.  I have clearly under-utilized my
alleged abilities.

<p>
<a href="2649.html#2665qlink4">&gt;Am I happier/more stable/more well-adapted  in general than most</a><br>
<i>&gt;people? I wouldn't say so.</i><br>


<p>
Don't be so sure about that.

<p>
<a href="2649.html#2665qlink5">&gt; But that doesn't go for all geniuses: My cousin Scott seems a happy</a><br>

I subscribe to this list precisely because I was in school
for so long that I became very accustomed to stimulating
discourse.  My work environment fails to satisfy my cravings
and this list goes a long way toward keeping the "dulls"
away so . . . thanks to all.
