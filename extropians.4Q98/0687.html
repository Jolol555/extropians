<p>
Its quite a while before EXTRO 4 happens and I'd rather have this
discussion now rather than the months leading up to the conference. 
This isn't the forum to get too detailed about security, except that
I'd like to know that at least the issue will be addressed. Of the
many lurkers on this list, I often wonder how many are hate motivated.
 Are there any of those "voluntary human extinction" types with Ted
Kazenski tendencies?   I expect Transhumanism to be getting pretty
close to critical mass in popularity in a year or two.  We may not be
serious threats to them now, but it is inevitable that such will be
the case in the near future.

<p>
I'm not involved with organizing the event, so I can only recommend
that we all keep a close eye on unknown individuals leaving back packs
or bags unattended.  And maybe those with concealed weapons licenses
should contact event organizers and volunteer to carry their g** word.
 I look forward to a safe EXTRO 4 knowing how alert we _can_ be.
