<p>
Beyond the classical economics context, I think that is very well
possible. Albeit it is difficult to compare 'demands' from the
economical and ecological (say, tropical rainforest) domain, 
in the latter's case the material and energy streams are clearly 
finite (=stagnated at a high level). I think this is also 
applicable to any system with a finite matterenergy concentration, 
which fairly covers them all.

<p>
Obviously, spatial proximity is only relevant if the transportation
costs (which are very low nowadays) are significant in comparison to
the production costs. Albeit autoreplicators could amplify means
of production as well as of transportation, there are external
constant factors to account for, unless the autoreplicator colony 
has grown large and heterogenous enough to start dealing within itself.

<p>
Only if compared to things that are growing faster. Over astronomical

time scales, a doubling rate of /20 a is certainly enormous. Whether
atoms, or grains of rice on the chessboard, on the long run the
outcome is the same.
