<i>&gt; Violent criminals I'm not sure should ever be released.</i><br>

<p>
I liked Piers Anthony's concept in _The Ring_ where violent criminals
are equipped with an electronic 'concience' which gives a bit of a shock
when the criminal has a violent thought, despite its civil rights
aspects. Since many violent offenders tend to be sociopathic
individuals, i.e. lacking in concience, equipping them with a prosthetic
concience would be a positive rehabilitative thing to do. The worry is
whos concience do you use as a model? A flower child or an Amish?

<a href="2053.html#2060qlink2">&gt; Sex offenders only when we are sure they will not offend again,</a><br>
<i>&gt; which tends to put them in the violent class in my book.</i><br>

<p>
I would tend to put many sex offenders in the class of the political
prisoner. Questionable 'crimes' like statutory rape is one of the
largest classes of sex offender. It seems rather ridiculous when you
have a case of two teenagers from different states that have different
consent laws making it legal for them to have sex in one state but
having sex in the other makes one of the participants a sexual offender.
Then, you also have this 'crime' being used as a pawn in many child
custody battles, with the use of manipulative CPS personnel programming
kids to 'recover' memories of events that never occured.

<a href="2053.html#2060qlink3">&gt; Drug offenders do not even belong in jail, as far as I'm concerned.</a><br>
<i>&gt; If society insists on making drug use a crime, this should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; handled with counciling, and community service.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am of the belief that most of a prison sentence should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; punishment, even if that punishment consists only of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; incarcerated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been thinking that the last year of a sentence should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; different. There should be extensive counciling, and work towards</i><br>
<i>&gt; job training and placement. Sort of like the civilian re-adjustment</i><br>
<i>&gt; lectures we received when leaving the military.</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, and get lots of Willie Horton's all over again. I don't think that
would fly. I am all for job training. Most such individuals commit crime
due to a lack of alternatives available, however it is also a matter of
social setting and peers. Releasing a criminal back into an old social
setting is merely expecting recidivism. Complete relocation, and
possible reprogramming via LSD or other assistance is a good idea.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2053.html#2060qlink4">&gt; I don't think anyone in jail should be released unless they are at</a><br>
<i>&gt; least GED equivalent. And certainly basic literacy is a must. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think any other programs should tend to be voluntary, to encourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; people to see the benefit of correct decision making.</i><br>

<p>
A GED is useless in todays society. They should have at least 36 college
credits worth of useful vocational/technical training. Here's an idea:
For every college credit earned, the convict gets a month off the
sentence. Every month of successfull counseling and good behavior gets a
month off the sentence. However, I would restructure the sentencing
guidelines to double the average sentence.

<p>
I would also advocate a Coventry-like colony.
