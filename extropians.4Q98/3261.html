<i>&gt;Samael said</i><br>
<a name="3273qlink1"><a href="3255.html#3261qlink1">&gt;&gt;some people would much rather be strong than smart</a> (in fact, by the way</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the world seems to work, vastly more people are into sport than are into</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;intelligence based activities).  So people are taking advantage of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;rather than of becoming an einstein.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't even know why i am  replying to this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3273qlink2"><i>&gt;a.  I have never met anyone who was glad that they were unintelligent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;b.  The notion that people choose not to be Einstein and instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;     take up sport is ludicrous.</a></i><br>


<p>
<a name="3273qlink3">So those people who don't read books, but take part in sports aren't
implicitly mqaking this choice then?</a>  The people who choose to watch
<a name="3273qlink4">Brainnumbing soaps rather than making use of their intelligence?</a>  The fact
<a name="3273qlink5">that 'smartie' is an insult, along with brainbox, etc.?</a>  There are a shed
load of insults based around being being 'too intelligent', and almost none
based around being too athletic.

<p>
<a name="3273qlink6">I've worked in various jobs previous tpo the last few years, working with
the general public and the majority of them don't give a damn about
intelligence as ,omg as they have something on the box to keep them
contented and a stomach full of food.
