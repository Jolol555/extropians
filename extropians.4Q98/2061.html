<a name="2068qlink2"> I think I like your straight and seemingly elegant use of logic, but I
hate the consequences. Then I will not act logically! (considering that
particular framing of logic anyway, I'm sure we can discuss the
probabilities and the fact you use fuzzy logic and yes/no state)</a>

  You must have come across the following argument before, what do you
think of it, what logical conclusions do you draw from it:

<p>
<a name="2183qlink1"><a name="2078qlink2">   (from Blaise Pascal) the argument of the bet:

<a name="2136qlink1"><a name="2068qlink3"><a name="2063qlink1">One: if you do not believe in christian god there are two possibilities,
<a name="2183qlink2">if christian god exists you will go in hell, if it doesn't</a> nothing
happen.

<a name="2183qlink3">Two: if you do believe in god, and it doesn't exist, then there is no
consequence, but if it does (finally) exist, then JackpoT!!! you go</a></a></a> in

   From a purely logical point of view, you should become a christian.</a>

<a name="2068qlink4">    And, do you currently think that there exist an objective morality?</a>

"what is the temperature in hell" is funny.
Question for probabilities course:
<a name="2079qlink1">how many more religions should one follow to increase by a tenfold the
possibilities to eventually end up in (some sort of) heaven?</a>
Bonus: atheism does not imply a zero probability...
