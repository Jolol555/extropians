Abstract
<br>
  Sodium selenate, administered
<br>
  intraperitoneally (i.p.), resulted in an improvement in
  glucose tolerance in treated diabetic rats. Fed rat plasma
  glucose levels were reduced by selenate
  treatment in streptozotocin diabetic rats. The lowest values of blood
  glucose were reached within 3 weeks of beginning the
  treatment. Food and fluid consumption was reduced in treated compared to
  untreated diabetic rats. Diabetic treated rats did not release insulin in
  response to a glucose challenge and insulin release in
  response to a challenge was markedly reduced in control treated rats.
  Assessment of heart function using a working heart apparatus showed that
  treated diabetic rats with improved blood glucose levels had
  normal heart function at 8 weeks of diabetes in contrast to hearts from
  non-treated diabetics. This study extends previous observations on the in
  vivo insulin-like effects of sodium
<br>
  selenate.
