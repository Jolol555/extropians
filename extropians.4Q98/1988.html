<a href="1952.html#1988qlink1">&gt; i am searching my memory banks.  there was an asimov short story</a><br>
<i>&gt; i read a long time ago about this.  someone had invented a machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that could somehow calculate the past.  you could punch in the space</i><br>
<i>&gt; and time coordinates and the machine would give you information</i><br>
<i>&gt; about that 4 space.  the government launched a huge effort to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep the whole thing secret.  the heroes struggled to get the information</i><br>
<i>&gt; out, so that if they were killed by government goons the world would</i><br>
<i>&gt; still have their gift.</i><br>

<p>
I have read that story many times over the years, most recently just a
few months ago.  I believe it may have been called "The Dead Past".

There was a story with an opposing theme, "I See You" by Damon Knight,
originally published in F&amp;SF in November, 1976, and also available in
several collections.  That story explores the effects of an all-purpose
space-time viewer.  It has led to a Utopian society, where concerns about
privacy are considered silly, and where crime is virtually unknown.  It's
a nice story, very well written although perhaps not fully persuasive.
