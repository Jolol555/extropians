Hello Damien,
<br>
I heard you on the abc the other week
<br>
went straight out and bought your book
<br>
it's been a long time since i can remember going out with such set
purpose to track down a particular book (due in equal amounts to your
good self, charm and wit and intelligence -by the way, Adams' humour
didn't get your (funny) jokey response to his question: Why make these
things so bloody small, which, if you recall, went something like this:
<br>
"well, i suppose for doing very tiny   and also the good adams himself)<br>
I wasn't disappointed
<br>
congratulations and thank you
<br>
you've considerably enriched the humble furnishings of my  unSpiked
brain!

<p>
PS
<br>
this is just what it purports to be: a friendly thank you/acknowledgment

<p>
beyond that, now i know where you hang out, i can look forward to
reading 'you' at greater length, and perhaps, who knows, I might bravely
venture the odd question, comment etc.
<br>
We never tire of saying it: but this is a great medium, isn't it:
sitting on the dunny one day, listening to Adams, the next day reading
your book, the next week: here am i, subsisting (perspectively) in a
corner of a cyber-agora, a discreet distance maintained, listening to
the public forum in which we find ourselves, like good republicans of
older orders, debating the great issues of all time...
well shit, i dunno...

<p>
c u
