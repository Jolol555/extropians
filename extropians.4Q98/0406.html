<p>
The unique aspect of quantum teleportation isn't its speed, which is no
faster than the particle which must travel between sender and receiver,
but the fact that the receiving particle ends up in exactly the same
quantum state that the sending particle was in.

<p>
This is significant only because of a peculiarly quantum phenomenon:
"you can't clone a quantum state."  That is, given a quantum particle,
it is impossible to create a duplicate which is in the same state.
Quantum teleportation exploits a loophole, which is that you *can* create
a duplicate if you destroy the original in the process.  (Of course it is
a matter of semantics then whether it should still be called a duplicate,
since there is only one.)

<p>
If we had classical physics, the analogous phenomenon to quantum
teleportation would be utterly mundane.  Measure the state of a system,
and send it to the other side, then build a system in the same state.
It is the impossibility of this technique in the quantum world which
made quantum teleportation such an amazing discovery.

<p>
As a matter of fact, teleportation of macroscopic objects like people
would almost certainly be done in the classical manner.  It is unlikely
that quantum phenomena play any role in determining our physical state.
Classical measurements of the particles which make up our brains and
bodies would be enough to create a remote duplicate.  With a sufficiently
mature technology, this will allow people to switch between uploaded
and physical bodies, and to travel to reception stations throughout
the universe, sending themselves as an information stream carried by a
light beam.

<p>
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/">http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/</a> has a description
and a picture of how quantum teleportation works.

<p>
As was already mentioned, it would not allow people at home to see
pictures from Alpha Centauri in real time.  Particles would have to
travel from there to here to carry any signals which would allow us to
see pictures, and those particles would travel no faster than light.
