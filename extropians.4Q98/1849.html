<i>&gt; &gt;  Second,I feel that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>

<p>
I always prefer an effective deterrent rather than having to go through the
expense and bother of a final solution. The emphasis, though, is on EFFECTIVE.

<a href="1786.html#1849qlink2">&gt; or as retroman@together.net (Michael Lorrey) so eloquently states.....</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Contrasting this with the huge deterrent effect that allowing law abiding</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to carry concealed weapons has on violent crimes, we can surmise that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the only effective form of death penalty is one which is exacted at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;crime scene. No technicalities, no appeals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can agree with that....</i><br>

<p>
Hardly. Putting a profit motive before the state would cause the state to seek to
expand the penalty to more and more crimes. Even, and especially, in a popular
democracy, with an aging population, there will be public pressure to expand the
penalty to more and more crimes. Larry Niven discussed this in many of his Known
Space stories.</a>
