<p>
The expense may pose difficulties for this idea. If someone has experience
with teleconferencing and wants to look into this for the event, I'm open
to the idea. I'm not sure how well teleconferencing works for a large
event, rather than for a small roundtable meeting. Perhaps it would best to
set up teleconferencing for a limited part of the event, maybe in a place
apart from the talks room.

<p>
If one of you knows about how to set this up and what it would cost, and
what equipment would be needed at the distal end, please let me know.

<p>
The current level of technology certainly doesn't make teleconferencing a
good substitute for actually being there. Previous EXTROs have drawn
transhumanists from all over Europe and as far away as Australia.
Marinating in extropian company for a few days is an experience that's hard
to beat!
