An initial note: Compared to many other things you can spend</a> your money on,

<i>&gt;  there when I'm thawed out, not some brain damaged version of me.</i><br>

<p>
I'm no technical expert, so I only have personal,</a> subjective opinions and
<a name="2130qlink13">value judgments to offer.  My ultimate opinion on this question</a> is based on
<a name="2130qlink14">observations of my own changing identity over time, both</a> in the short run and
<a name="2130qlink15">the long run.  I find that my "brain state" varies so much even</a> over the short
<a name="2130qlink16">period of a few days -- yet with a continuing sense of identity</a> -- that I
<a name="2130qlink17">would want to be "revived" even if the entity thus created</a> shared only a small
<a name="2130qlink18">fraction of its identity with "me" (now).  When I consider</a> how different I am
<a name="2130qlink19">from the "me" I was even a few years ago -- much less the "me"</a> of my childhood
<a name="2130qlink20">-- my opinion on the subject becomes even stronger.
  
<p>
<a href="1924.html#2117qlink3">&gt;  2) I'm almost 30 now.  I fully expect to live at least to 2040 and</a><br>
<i>&gt;  hopefully 2050.  What are the chances we won't have</a> developed mature</i><br>
<a name="2130qlink21"><i>&gt;  nanotechnology by then?</i><br>

<p>
If by "mature nanotechnology" you mean things like "utility fog",</a> I think the
<a name="2130qlink22">chances are far less than 50%.  (I do think the chances</a> are MUCH better that
<a name="2130qlink23">we'll have very potent "early nanotech" by then, though.</a>  I think we're likely
<a name="2130qlink24">to see the earliest "nanotech" -- diamondoid thread and ribbon</a> -- in c. 5
<a name="2130qlink25">years, for what it's worth.)

<p>
More important than "mature nanotech" per se will</a> be the many incremental
<a name="2130qlink26">developments in molecular biology which, by 2010 even will</a> have added a decade
<a name="2130qlink27">to your life span, IMHO.  However, such a realization</a> shouldn't undermine
<a name="2130qlink28">commitment to cryonics now.  First, you can't be sure</a> you won't contract some
<a name="2130qlink29">kind of disease or develop some kind of condition for which</a> a cure is just
<a name="2130qlink30">over your personal horizon and second, you may well be involved</a> in some sort
<a name="2130qlink31">of accident for which cryonics will be a necessary safety net.
  
<p>
<a href="1924.html#2117qlink4">&gt;  3) If I name a Cryonics organization as a beneficiary of life</a><br>
<i>&gt;  insurance in order to secure financing for freezing and I expire in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  such a way that I'm not salvageable (explosion, acid, eaten,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  spontaneous combustion, alien abduction, lost at sea, etc.)</a> is there a</i><br>
<a name="2130qlink32"><i>&gt;  clause to divert the money to my family?  </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;From a technical legal standpoint, you COULD have such a clause</a> in your</i><br>
<a name="2130qlink33">insurance policy.  As a practical matter, though, I think</a> it is unlikely that
<a name="2130qlink34">you could get this into a policy you could actually buy.</a>  The problem would be
<a name="2130qlink35">crafting language for a contingent beneficiary clause</a> that would define a
<a name="2130qlink36">certain enough condition to trigger the payment to the contingent
beneficiaries.  Language to the effect "in case my brain</a> is so damaged that
<a name="2130qlink37">cryonic suspension is not practical, then pay my kids" keys off</a> of a condition
<a name="2130qlink38">that would be determined by reference to 1) a changing state</a> of the art and 2)
<a name="2130qlink39">potentially differing expert opinion about what would</a> be a sufficiently
<a name="2130qlink40">damaged brain state.  We're lucky enough that a few</a> financially solid life
<a name="2130qlink41">insurers are willing to write cryonics insurance (most won't);</a> inserting this
<a name="2130qlink42">added uncertainty into the claims process is something</a> the very conservative
<a name="2130qlink43">life insurance industry simply won't tolerate.

<p>
Consider that the insurance benefit that will fund</a> a neuro suspension --
<a name="2130qlink44">$50,000 -- is really a VERY small amount of life insurance.  If</a> you have a
<a name="2130qlink45">real need for life insurance for economic dependants who will</a> still be in that
<a name="2130qlink46">state at the time of your death, $50,000 is not very helpful.</a>  Furthermore,
<a name="2130qlink47">cryonics arrangements stand in lieu of traditional burial, so</a> one gets at
<a name="2130qlink48">least some offsetting cost savings there.  Thus for most people, the
"misdirected benefit" issue in the case of an impossible</a> suspension is a
<a name="2130qlink49">negligible economic issue.

<p>
Finally, consider the actual dollar present cost</a> of cryonics arrangements.  I
<a name="2130qlink50">made my arrangements when I was 39, and locked my premium</a> in at just under
<a name="2130qlink51">$1,200 per year (and I have a sub-optimal underwriting profile).</a>  The annual
<a name="2130qlink52">dues for Alcor are $360 (if I recall correctly).  The less</a> than $1,500 per
<a name="2130qlink53">year I pay for my cryonics arrangements is one of the better</a> values I buy, in
<a name="2130qlink54">my opinion. In a recent case of a friend who is 28 and healthy,</a> I saw an
<a name="2130qlink55">annual premium of about $400 for a whole body suspension ($125,</a>000 death
<a name="2130qlink56">benefit).  That means that the total cost is under $800 per year.</a>  My guess is
<a name="2130qlink57">that the total neuro cost would be under $500 per year</a> for a healthy person in
<a name="2130qlink58">their 20s.

<p>
<a href="1924.html#2117qlink5">&gt;  4) Is life insurance even Transhuman?  I'm betting I'll</a> die before my</a><br>
<a name="2130qlink59"><i>&gt;  family does.  The whole point of being transhuman is that I DON'T</i><br>
<i>&gt;  WANNA DIE!</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'd almost rather spend the money on staying</a> healthy - supplements, etc.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2130qlink60">I don't want to die either, but I wear a seat belt in my car</a> and see that it
<a name="2130qlink61">is equipped with airbags, being willing to pay the cost and take</a> the time to
<a name="2130qlink62">use these safety devices.  Investing in a cryonics contract</a> is simply an
<a name="2130qlink63">action of the same kind: devoting current resources</a> to a safety device; it is
<a name="2130qlink64">a species of risk-shifting, all of which involves some current costs.
