Hello,

<p>
This is an issue that the AT&amp;T WorldNet® Service Abuse Group is currently
investigating, as well as our legal staff, and some law enforcement
agencies.  Attempts to apprehend the perpetrators of these abusive emails
and websites is ongoing The primary cause of the problem is an individual
or group of individuals that re-register with the service,  after the
account has been canceled due to violation of the Terms and Conditions.
Using the latest array of "real-time" tools, we scan for and put a halt to
these accounts.  Because the name and address in the registration
information is often forged with stolen credit cards, it poses problems.
This has been and will continue to be an ongoing effort until it is
completely stopped.  We appreciate your assistance in furnishing us with
copies of the "spam".   Direct your complaint to the WorldNet Abuse Desk at
the address below. Please send the expanded header with the spam. The
expanded header is imperative, since it shows the time stamp and IP address
of the sender. Although you only receive an auto-reply from abuse, I would
like to assure you each complaint is thoroughly investigated. Please bear
with us as we work to bring this situation to closure.

Best Regards,

AT&amp;T WorldNet Service Postmaster
