<p>
Good news from the Sixth Foresignt Conference in Santa Clara.
Five major advances were announced. Here is a brief summary of
each advance:

<p>
1 - Bucky Horns: Sumio Iijima of NEC Corporation, Japan, announced 
the ability to grow this new class of carbon nanostructures, the 
next step beyond buckyballs and buckytubes. 

<p>
2 - Biopowered Nanomotor: Carlo Montemagno of Cornell University 
announced success in building biological-motor powered mechanical 
devices. All the tools are now in place to make this happen within 
a living cell. (I posted about this one on Friday)

<p>
3 - Nanomanipulator: MinFeng Yu of Washington University generated 
excitement by showing the first-ever movies of interactive 3D 
manipulation of carbon nanotubes, using a new research device built 
by Zyvex LLC. 

<p>
4 - Nanotube Transistor: Cees Dekker of Delft University of 
Technology, The Netherlands, presented work on buckytubes as a new 
kind of molecular quantum wire and a field effect nanotube 
transistor, called TubeFET. 

<p>
5 - Single-Molecule Tape Measure: Mark Akeson of University of 
California, Santa Cruz, announced the use of a molecular pore able 
to electrically "read" long molecules at high speed, even 
differentiating among DNA bases in groups as small as five. 
Next goal: rapidly read DNA base-by-base.
