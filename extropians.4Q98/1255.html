<a name="1257qlink1">Today, if someone goes out and surveys the literature,
and gathers a lot of data, then publishes a book arguing on the basis of that
data that, say, Asians are generally all-around smarter than Caucasians,
those people are called racists.  Rationality is irrelevant to the label.</a>

<p>
<a name="1259qlink1"><a name="1257qlink2">The only way not to be a racist today is to say that race and genetics
makes no difference in behavior or intelligence or strength.</a>
Someone who regards themselves as genetically transhuman has taken the
critical step of acknowledging that genetics makes a difference.</a>

<p>
<a name="1259qlink2"><a name="1257qlink3">I am not saying that the term "racist" is being applied incorrectly.
I think it is correct.<a name="1286qlink1">  Someone who believes there are or can be
significant observable behavioral differences correlated with race
is a racist.  And anyone who considered themselves transhuman would
necessarily believe</a> that.  Once you believe that, it would be inconsistent
not to consider that there might be behavioral differences between other
human races, and once you consider that, you are a racist at heart.
