And, to summarize briefly my reply from the Singularity debate:

<p>
All your examples, and moreover all your assumptions, deal with (1) roughly
constant intelligence and (2) a total lack of positive feedback.  That is, the
model treats with the curve of a constant optimizing ability, which quite
naturally peters out.  The improvements are not to the optimizing ability, but
to something else.  The Flynn effect improves brains, not evolution.  Moore's
law improves hardware, and even VLSI design aids, but not brains.  There's no
positive feedback into anything, much less intelligence.  With intelligence
enhancement, each increment of intelligence results in a new prioritized list,
since improving intelligence changes which improvements can be contemplated or perceived.

<p>
Look back at the archives for more detailed arguments.
