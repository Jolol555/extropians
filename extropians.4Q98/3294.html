Seems to demand more medical knowledge than they displayed. In any
case, according to the story, the Romans didn't want him dead anyway,
so they wouldn't have required much persuasion.  In no version is 
Jesus up there long enough to kill a healthy man in his thirties.  That
normally takes days with crucifixion.  My speculative take on the 
real-world origin of the Passion story is that at some point the Romans
were coerced into crucifying somebody they didn't want dead.  After
a couple hours they said "he's dead" and took him down.  Later the
guy shows up and naturally the rumor starts up that he rose from
the dead.

<p>
Of course, maybe it's just a story.  Our only source of information is the
Gospels, which are horribly corrupted with mistranslation, additions,
and stuff from other myths.  Still, I'm inclined to think there's some reality
behind it.
