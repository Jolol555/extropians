Well, for example, if the average compensation level for a machine
intelligence were $0.00, while the average compensasion level for a biological
human level intelligence were $30,000.00, you could state accurately that the
average wage level would drop to $15,000.00 if half the work force were AI.
However, no legally human entity's wage would drop. Moreover, since the
</a>
biological human's productivity would be seen to rise (as the AI's he or she
manages increase their productivity), then the human's wage should rise to
compensate for this rise in productivity. This sceanario directly contradicts
the implied conclusions of your paper, that introduction of machine
intelligence would lead to poverty for all....

<p>
I would say that this is the proper way to look at it, for the  most part. I
mean, why would an AI have material wants and desires unless we program them
into the AI?? Our own materialistic desires are based on our evolved nest
building instincts, something which an AI will not posess. What does an AI
need anyway??? More disk space??? more peripherals? Since such assets will be
networked, AIs should be able to operate in a much more socialistic economic
environment. There would be no need for an AI to have permanent posessions
outside of its own hardcopy, and no ongoing consumption outside of a few watts
of power, and rent for variable temporary processing space/
