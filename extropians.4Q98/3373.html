<a href="3329.html#3373qlink1">&gt; Before after Mars to reign by good luck</a><br>

<p>
You wouldn't be talking about my mother, Marsha Dawn, would you?

<p>
And reign of terror?  That must be the media lab's button pushing!

<p>
Hmmm.  1999 final solution.  Sounds almost Nazi, doesn't it.

<p>
You wouldn't be promoting the "kill file" approach to herd 
management, would you?

<p>
Personally, if Hitler had more antidepressants, he probably would 
have skipped the cattle cars, ovens and gas chambers, and yes, even 
the THEL laze the NAC tactics.  If his seratonin levels were higher, 
and he didn't have to worry about VD, he'd probably have resorted to 
simple bribery and printing of Mickey Money, IMO.

<p>
Now, to North Korea and Baghdad....

<p>
Does Hal Finney remember the movie "LOOKER", with Albert Finney?

<p>
   <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Looker+(1981)">http://us.imdb.com/Title?Looker+(1981)</a>

<p>
In this movie, supermodels were scanned into supercomputers and 
animated in VR to provide hypnotic and seductive super sales pitches 
for advertisers wares.

<p>
Another interesting gadget presented in the flick was a "stunner" 
that could stop people's consciousness temporarily, while handymen 
went about their business rearranging things in the environment.

<p>
I'm not sure what the black box folks call these things.  I've nicked 
named them "stunned-like-a-deer-in-a-daze-in-headlights", which 
shortens to "stunned-like-a-deer", or simply, "deer-in-a-daze".

<p>
I'm thinking this: entertain them all into being happily educated and 
rational compatible cooperative stewards and tourists.  Maybe, some 
water supply birth control, coupled with deer-in-a-daze artificial 
insemination, or something like that.  I'm sure that's how 
reproduction on earth is currently being managed by the Looker Lab 
eugenecists.

<p>
Who needs another genocide or Holocaust?

<p>
I'd much prefer a hempfest orgy of hedonists!
