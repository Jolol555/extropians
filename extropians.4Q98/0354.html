<a name="0376qlink5">In "Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku, a scenerio is sketched out which seems like
it would work. You make a worm hole - he descibred how to do this, it
involves something with charging two sets of plates and relies on something
called the Casmir Effect, which has been observed in the lab on a small
scale, but he didn't go into much more detail about it - anyway, you make a
worm hole using the Casmir Effect, and you have the two ends of a wormhole
right next to eachother. You then put one on a ship, and accelerate it to
near-light speed, and fly it around for a while, then after 20 years or so,
return it to its original position. While this one end of a worm hole was
going very fast, time was compressed for it - say it was going fast enough
that only 10 seconds passed for it while 20 years passed for the other end
of the worm hole which did not travel. Now, you have a wormhole which has
one end at point A in space, and its other end only a mile or so away,</a> but
one end is twenty years ahead of the other one. You pass through one end and
come out the other end twenty years into the future. Pass the other way, and
go twenty years into the past.
