Maybe it's just too late, but I don't see how you get this result, Robin. A
*pragmatic* calculus would give you this result. Setting aside the moral
issue, you might go for the Jupiter mission because you know the legless
astronauts will be stuck with it and can't screw up your mission by
deciding to return to Earth. But, if they take the moral issue into
account, they would do the opposite of what you suggest. If they cannot
afford to get back from Jupiter, they are simply stuck and their options
limited. If they are on the moon and can barely afford to return to Earth,</a>
their options are not great, but they are broader than the Jupiter people.
They may get home poor (maybe they can sell their story to the media...)
but at least they have that option, whereas the Jupiter folks do not. So, I
get the opposite result from you. Or are we somehow talking at
cross-purposes here?

I agree, but I never suggested that. Whether it's okay to make a Morlock
would depend on many things, adding up to what kind of life a Morlock would
have. If above-surface humans were rapidly dying off due to apocalyptic
environmental changes, children might be much better off as Morlocks.

space. They have every right to do this.</a> Given that they are going into
<a name="0655qlink3">space, I was suggesting that it might be morally unproblematic for them to
then have children in space who were better adapted. I don't think that the
children would have a justifiable complaint about being in space, since it
was a decision made by the parents for themselves. Given that decision,
they must then decide whether to have children. If the offspring will have
lives worth living, this seems a reasonable choice. The parents in this
situation are not limiting the children, the parents are making choices
about their own lives then producing offspring in the resulting situation.</a>

had been born in China.</a>
