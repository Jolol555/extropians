For what it's worth I'm 50 and have had this problem all my life, at least
until I stumbled onto this list.
<br>
It was a major revolution to me that there was an organized(?) group out
there that I could relate to.

&gt; Well, I barely discuss it with my friends. Actually during one break
&gt; period I showed one of my friends the Extropian Homepage, heh, she
&gt; really wasn't very interested. I don't think they really understand it
&gt;
&gt; and it doesn't really appeal to them. Then again I'm not quite sure if
&gt;
&gt; anything appeals to them. Heh. I'm not even sure if they have ever
&gt; heard
&gt; the word transhumanistic. The people I hang out with aren't really
&gt; like
&gt; me. They listen to the same music as me, you know like Nirvana, Nine
&gt; Inch Nails... But I've never really met anyone that is interested in
&gt; the
&gt; same ideas and thoughts as me. That's kind of why I joined the mailing
&gt;
&gt; list, so I can read what others think about things that I don't
&gt; normally
&gt; discuss with my friends, or family.
