<a name="0886qlink1">ralph, you have hit on the issue which will prevent computer controlled
cars, as well as most future revolutions.  if that computer fails and
kills someone, it is unclear in our litigious society, who gets sued.</a>
<a name="0886qlink2">what if your 6 yr old takes your computer driven car and it
hits someone?</a>  what if you send your car unaccompanied to your
<a name="0886qlink3">friend's house and it hits someone?</a>  what if your computer car
<a name="0886qlink4">is sitting still at a light and some yahoo who wants a new car
sees you asleep in the passenger side and backs into you, then
claims you hit her?</a>  we insist that someone be responsible always,

<a name="0886qlink6">besides, if computer driven cars became accepted, microsoft
would get into, then dominate that market.  i would not only
refuse to ride in a microsoft car, i would flee in terror from
any such device.  {8^D  spike
