<a name="2167qlink1"><a name="1150qlink1"><a name="1098qlink1">Does anyone know of any systematic deprogramming techniques that can 
be used to efficiently reprogram Regilious believe systems to 
rational belief systems?</a></a>

<p>
<a name="1051qlink1">For example, if you were in charge of network programming for Baghdad 
metropolitan and suburban television, and had an unlimited supply of 
SONY Trinitron televisions to hand out, would it be possible to 
convert the citizens' attitudes to some that were more friendly to 
Western ideas?</a>

<p>
In the interest of "Open Systems", what if we were to suddenly 
eliminate National Borders and Customs?  What would happen?

<p>
How could we accelerate memetic propagation in such a way that there 
could evently be free and unrestricted global travel</a> and goods 
distribution?
