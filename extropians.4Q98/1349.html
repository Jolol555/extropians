Single child.

Now, nothing against 'Extropian, know thyself', far from it, 
but we've been certainly poll-polluting the list way too 
much lately. Kathryn stated correctly that self-answered 
polls on electronic channels might be doubly biased. At 
the very least we should move future polls to private 
communications (whoever provoking a poll shall be charged with
gathering the result and posting the totals to the main list), 
also, ExI might install some electronic (cgi-bin) poll 
infrastructure, especially among the nonconnected extropians 
<br>
(mundanes).<br>

<p>
As to whether everybody on a listserv is an XNTX, a single
counterexample should suffice. Removing self-selection-by-answering
bias should be more difficult, but possible.

<p>
ciao,
