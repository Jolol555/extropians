<i>&gt; The government's doing that??????  Really?????</i><br>

<p>
Of course they do - the more children a family on welfare has, the
larger of a welfare check the family gets.  Plenty of young unwed
mothers attempt to have many children just to get a larger check.  The
children usually suffer.

<p>
When the government attempts to educate it must use tax money stolen
from wage earners.

leaving

<a href="2207.html#2209qlink7">&gt; a convenient underclass to do all the dirty work.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
The government creates the underclass as a convenient voting block. 
Socialist governments (including the US) offer a clear incentive for
people to be poor.  By providing a guaranteed subsistence to anyone -
regardless of whether they're willing to work or not, the government
is basically paying people not to work.

would not

<i>&gt; &gt;violence against any who disagree with government's "solutions"</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Gosh, now there's a slightly one-sided view of things.  The free</i><br>
market
<br>
<a href="2207.html#2209qlink12">&gt; generally provides the best solution, but government is dead handy</a><br>
for avoid
<br>
<a href="2207.html#2209qlink13">&gt; ing things like monopolies, unfair trade, police, armies, contract</a><br>
laws,
<br>
<a href="2207.html#2209qlink14">&gt; basic research (although, thankfully the free makret is moving into</a><br>
this
<br>
<a href="2207.html#2209qlink15">&gt; area), welfare and (in my case) socialised medicine (which means</a><br>
that if I
<br>
<a href="2207.html#2209qlink16">&gt; break a leg I'm not penalised for doing it while broke).</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Government provides nothing useful.  "Monopolies" that are created
without coercion (favorite tool of government) are not bad things. 
I'm not sure what unfair trade is - must be something the government
does.  Socialised Medicine??????  That's a good thing?  That's insane.
 Remember - all forms of socialism are grounded in violence - the
coercion required to steal money from wage earners.

<p>
I suppose you either support the use of violence for solving
social/political problems (not very Extropian) or you don't.  There is
no way for government to function without coercion (violence) -
therefore, I don't see much need for government at all.

<p>
I suggest you acquire a copy of "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry
Hazlitt.  I think you may find it an eye-opening experience.


<p>
<a href="2207.html#2209qlink17">&gt; But this isn't a political forum, so I'll leave it there.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Stopping entropy (what we're all about) requires us all to rethink our
political views as well as philosophical and technological.
