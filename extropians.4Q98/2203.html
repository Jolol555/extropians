<a name="2212qlink2"> Hell, this isn't even A Fire Upon The Deep.  The Singularity is not some
magic box that contains everything you want.  The Singularity is a gigantic
tidal wave and it does not turn to our wishes.  There's a chance you'll get
what you want, but it's by no means certain.</a>

<a name="2212qlink3">Once I predicted that the Powers would be ethical, and I was happy until I
admitted to myself that I had no idea what "ethical" meant.</a>  I had predicted
<a name="2212qlink4">two things:  First, that there would be titanic powers, unbound by game
theory, following a purpose I couldn't forsee, and with no reason not to
flatten anything in their way.  Second, that this would be a good thing,</a> the
<a name="2212qlink5">thing that we ourselves would approve if we were intelligent enough.</a>

<p>
<a name="2212qlink6">And third, that even if we wanted to protect ourselves, the best</a> course would
<a name="2212qlink7">still be to keep the Singularity clear and clean, simple and elegant and
direct.  Trying to slow down the march of progress will get us all killed,</a> and
<a name="2212qlink8">trying to coerce the Singularity will put us in hell.</a>

<p>
<a name="2212qlink9">(And the Singularity surely isn't inevitable; one nuclear war would</a> be enough
<a name="2212qlink10">to put it off hundreds of years.  As Michael M. Butler says, "Waiting</a> for the
<a name="2212qlink11">bus is a bad idea if you turn out to be the bus driver.")</a>
