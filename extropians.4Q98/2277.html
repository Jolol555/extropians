<a href="2251.html#2277qlink1">&gt;Is it just me, or doesn't it look like there is ample room for an</a><br>
<i>&gt;interesting synthesis of transhumanist thinking with some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;eastern philosophical systems without having to throw important things</i><br>
<i>&gt;like critical thinking and empiricism overboard (as you often have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do when trying it with western religions)?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3241qlink1">Yes, I think so.</a> Like other aspects of emerging singularity-related
acceleration, the convergence of science and contemplative approaches seems
entirely appropriate, if not inevitable.</a> Notwithstanding the mysticism of
books such as _The Tao of Physics_ (familiar to many on this list, no
doubt), prominent men and women of science have occasionally offered
enlightened comments concerning cosmology and the significance of life.
<a name="2310qlink2">Remember, for example, Einstein's famous line, "God does not play dice."
(So, Pascal, take your silly wager</a> and... )

<p>
As an aside (and hopefully not to affend anyone), what does "western
religions" mean?
<br>
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all come from the Middle East. Hinduism,
Buddhism, and Taoism all come from the East. "western religion" must mean
Paganism, Animism, and Shamanism?
