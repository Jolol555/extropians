Regarding Fabulich's comments on the theoretical evolution of PPA's into PPF's.

<p>
<i>&gt; Because many, many people believe that their government is acting reasonably</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3318.html#3396qlink2">&gt; (at least some of the time).  They are happy (ish) with their</a><br>
<i>&gt; representatives.  While it is not a true PPA, it is acting as if it thinks</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is (governments frequently refer to themselves as servants of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people).  However, it's an organisation that's now claimed a monopoly on</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's area (although I've seen it claimed elsewhere here that PPA's would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to have a monopoly on the area they cover) and is 'out of control'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

Well, unfortunately, in my opinion, we do not do a sufficient amount of teaching
of people about the meaning and purpose of our government, which is why so much
of the silly collectivist ideas have seeped in over the years from europe and
spread so insidiously.

<p>
Any system requires for it to work that the members of the system actually
understand how the system works and why it is the way it is, and that at least a
significant number, preferably a majority, actually beleive that the system
works best that way.

<p>
Currently here in the US, we have what is called a culture war, which is thought
by many to be a two way culture ware, but I would say that there are at least
three sides to it. The economic culture war seems to be moving in favor of the
fiscal conservatives and libertarians, while the social culture war is moving in
the direction, slowly, of the liberals and libertarians, but the civil rights
culture war is definitely regressing away from libertarianism and toward the
fascist wings of the other two sides, which is why we have Jerry Fallwell and
NOW on the same side with regards to pornography, Ralph Nader and the FBI on the
same side with regards to cryptography, etc.

<p>
This war, to many, is as crucial as the other two, perhaps even more so because
it protects our ability to dissent. Without political dissidents like ourselves
injecting new ideas and arguments into the public discource, the system would
stagnate and calcify into an unacceptable state.
