<p>
<a name="1558qlink2"> It's running on a 180 mhz pentium with bandwidth that is probably above
average. It may be moved to a better machine soon. The biggest problems are
that Perl is slow for what it tries to do, and there are probably some
unidentified inefficencies in how it handles network i/o. Nobody has
volunteered to do much work in these areas.

<a name="1558qlink3"> To the extent I understand what you are saying, I can't see any similarity
between Drexler's beliefs and the beliefs you are attacking. Possibly Merkle
oversimplifies too much when dealing with people who ask the usual half-baked
questions, but when responding to thoughfull questions I think he is more
skeptical about those issues than you imply.

<p>
 I suspect you misunderstand Drexler precisely because most of his
communication is via media you find less accesible than the web. (Most
of what I know of his arguments comes mainly from Nanosystems and from
hearing him in person).

<i>&gt; &gt; possible, I think nanotech advocates are more vulnerable to criticism.</i><br>

<a name="1558qlink5"><i>&gt;Futurology is not science.</i><br>

<p>
 A ridiculous claim. It isn't very succesfull as a science, but there are
plenty of falsifiable hypotheses.
</a>

<p>
<a name="1558qlink6"><a href="1272.html#1547qlink6">&gt; There exists no validated scheme to assign</a><br>

<p>
 Engineering time forecasts are routinely made for incompletely specified
blueprints, and are often of some help in resolving policy disputes.
</a>

<p>
<a name="1558qlink7"><a href="1272.html#1547qlink7">&gt;Is such a device possible? No one can say, now. If there was a</a><br>

<p>
 One of the many reasons that nobody has provided a detailed blueprint is
that we don't have systems powerfull enough to adequately simulate them yet.

<p>
 I'm not sure what kind of theory you are asking for. I am fairly confident
that for any given feature that an assembler would require, a conservative
design can be found such that most chemists would say (without feeling a need
for simulation) that it would probably work if built. I think Drexler has
</a>
<a name="1558qlink9">produced some clear reasons for suspecting his ideas, or something more
powerfull, will eventually be built. I think the biggest uncertainty comes
from the shortage of good tools for bootstrapping the construction of such
features, and that many people are underestimating the progess that has
been made recently on such tools.
</a>
<br>
<a name="1558qlink10"> I think a handfull of people (possibly Drexler, probably someone at Zyvex)
have moderately clear guesses about what engineering steps will be taken when.
Unfortunately, I haven't seen those guesses published anywhere.
</a>

<p>
<a name="1558qlink11"><a href="1272.html#1547qlink9">&gt; Which does not mean that it is impossible -- simply </a><br>
<i>&gt;we. just. can't. tell. yet.</i><br>

<p>
 That is a conclusion that Drexler and I would be glad for most people
to adopt. The belief that it can't possibly happen in the next 20 years
is potentially quite dangerous. Uncertainty poses much fewer risks.

 My responses are often slow because I give them lower priority than working
on molecular modelling software, but if discussions like these raise doubts

<p>
 I hope the phrase "Generic Saviour" is intended to be sarcastic, but I
think it is dangerous to make claims that could be interpreted as
encouraging complacency about the effects of nanotech.
