<p>
Since Raymond Kurzweil's new book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, has
been mentioned here recently, I'm forwarding this announcement. I'm still
reading an advance draft copy, but I saw the published book in Barnes and
Noble yesterday.

<p>
<a name="3671qlink1">Raymond recently became familiar with Extropy Institute, and tells me that
we will be included in the resources listing of the next printing (which
will be a major one). We are already listed in there, though not as ExI --
his gives a URL to Natasha's Vita More's Singularity feature in Extropy
Online.</a>

<p>
BTW, I also strongly recommend Raymond's health book, The 10% Solution to
anyone with heart disease risk. I found that it inspired me to renew my
commitment to cutting my fat intake way down. (My father died of heart
disease and both my older brothers have it, though all three also have
several chosen risk factors that I have avoided.)
