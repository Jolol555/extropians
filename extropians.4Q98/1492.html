    &gt;Ah, but we are not in quantum mecanics here, brains are macroscopic
    &gt;objects, so we can track their positions in space-time.

<p>
How can you track them?<a name="1524qlink1"> If your brain and mine are identical then there is no
way to determine if they've switched positions or not, and it wouldn't matter
if they did.</a></a></a>


<p>
<a name="1494qlink2">     &gt;A brain is also strongly defined by his position.<br>


<p>
How? The input position of the sense organs is the only thing that's
important, the only restriction is that the sense organs are not so far away
that time delays caused by the speed of light start to become important.</a>
<a name="1494qlink3">A brain by itself has no way to determine it's position in space, or the
passage of time for that matter. I could stop your brain for a thousand
years, speed it up by a factor of a billion, or even make it run backward and
you'd never notice a thing. In the future "people" might not know or care where
their brain was, or if they were operating on their primary or backup brain.</a>


<p>
<a href="1453.html#1492qlink1">     &gt;even if everything you know I know, and everything I see</a><br>
<i>     &gt;feel and hear you see and feel and hear, even if we are for a moment</i><br>
<i>     &gt;complete identical copies, we can't be exchanged.</i><br>


<p>
Why? Exactly what would be different?
