I have a feeling that one of the last noble acts of nation states will
be to purchase these [commercial] items off-the-shelf (including all 
patents and copyrights) and make them available for "free" to the 
citizens (it is *their* money, after all).  This would extend to the 
whole body knowledge, including digitized versions of all media 
properties.

<p>
Distributing this stuff is another matter.  Cascades of solid state
proxies are needed, along with flat panel displays, and a local fiber 
infrastructure capable of handling the bandwidth required for all the 
video clips (e.g., an avatar of compatible language, vocabulary, and 
personality saying, "here's how you do (x)").

<p>
The importance of the multicasting (and realtime archiving) of high 
quality video can't be overstated.  The system will need to be 
extremely responsive.

<p>
A extremely useful activity for the citizens then will be to 
translate all these video clips into the optimal form for the 
individual self-healer.  Different people respond to different 
presentations of the same material.

<p>
Rather than trying to synthesize all these various presentation 
forms, a more efficient approach will be create a convenient 
automated system for acquiring and archiving the data.

<p>
In terms of opportunties for activity, a knowledge worker could 
access small chunks of content (e.g., a sentence at a time), then 
paraphrase or rephrase that information back into the system, to give 
the archive the diversity of styles reflected in society.

<p>
Rather than attempting to synthesize avatars, it's probably more 
useful on a social level to simply record real people being honest, 
particularly in the context of performing helpful actions.

<p>
I've always wanted to have books read to me, not by computers, but by 
people.  Imagine the same book, read aloud by a thousand different 
people, in a thousand different voices and styles. 

<p>
It will be wonderful to be able to walk around freely while absorbing 
knowledge.  In my case, it's very difficult for me to "sit still" 
while reading.  This would do much to improve my education, since my 
eyes need to move spontaneously while storing and accessing memories. 
 When I'm listening, my eyes are moving all over the place.  When I'm 
reading, they're paralyzed by the linearity of writing.

<p>
In terms of where to put the money, manufacturing facilities for RAM, 
optical fiber, and flat panel displays would be a better investment, 
in the long run, than into obsolete institutions like the FDA, DOE, 
FCC, DEA, and others.  A broadband internet obviously eliminates the 
need for these agencies, since self-representation is made possible.

<p>
By the way, about that URL...;
