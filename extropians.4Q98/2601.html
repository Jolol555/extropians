"John Clark" &lt;jonkc@worldnet.att.net&gt;:

<p>
<a href="2597.html#2601qlink1">&gt; I don't want to oversell my case, there is no doubt that some good science</a><br>
<i>&gt; has come from government funded research, and that's not surprising</i><br>
<i>&gt; considering that government has trillions of dollars at it's disposal. Even a</i><br>
<i>&gt; monkey throwing around that kind of money would occasionally do some good.</i><br>

<p>
John (&amp; Extropians):

<p>
It's my hypothesis that there are privately funded research scientists 
who know how to stimulate nerves from a distance with enough 
precision to throw a monkey around.  I further hypothesize that this 
gives them a certain amount of power over human society.  The 
ability to drive people around like puppets would also make law 
enforcement obsolete, assuming that the puppetmaster programming 
was peace oriented.

<p>
How much electricity does it take to stimulate a nerve?

<p>
How can that electricity be delivered via electromagnetic energy?

<p>
How fast does a signal need to be switched in order to 
simultaneously yet precisely stimulate the exact nerve patterns 
required for complex behavior?

<p>
Can Quantum Tunneling Transistors be used to switch this?

<p>
Can ground-based or space-based EMP arrays be used as 
transmitting antenna's?

<p>
Can ground-based high-energy lasers switched with quantum 
tunneling transistors provide the antennae array with accurate 
enough timing to direct electricity to specific synapse-pairs and 
neurons?

<p>
Can flywheels (<a href="http://www.trinityflywheel.com/">http://www.trinityflywheel.com/</a>) with cryogenic 
temperature superconductors be used as a ground-based source of 
high amplitude current to supply the high energy lasers that charge 
the space based EMP arrays?

<p>
Can Quantum Dot Cell Memory be used to store the holographic 
representations of a brains quantum state with 1/120th of a second 
resolution?  Can these tapes be recorded and played back, to the 
same individual, or translated between the Central Nervous Systems 
of various individuals?

<p>
Can human genes be modified so that unnecessary coding (noise) 
is eliminated, thereby maximizing the genomic signal to noise ratio?

<p>
Can human genes be spliced with genes from other animals, so that 
human "blanks" (anencephalic clones) can be rapidly grown inside 
of artifical environments?  Can this growth be accelerated by 
provided direct muscle stimulation and isometric exercises using the 
previously mentioned high amplitude quantum switched radio 
telemetry?

<p>
Can the "illusion" of death be overcome, by backing up a human's 
life experiences onto QDCM, then interfacing the QDCM with a 
"BLANK" produced in the fast organism growth system described 
above?

<p>
If you could have a harem of supermodel "blanks" that behaved in a 
manner completely complimentary to your physical, intellectual, and 
emotional needs, would you?

<p>
If you could have yourself backed-up onto QDCM, such that in the 
event of your untimely death, your nucleus accumbens could be 
transplanted to a "BLANK", then that "BLANK" could be reanimated 
using superconducting flywheels, QDCM, QTT, HEL, &amp; EMP, would 
that appeal to you?
