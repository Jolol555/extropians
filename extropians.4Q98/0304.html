I understand your point, but still think it would be better to avoid
putting a time frame on the term this way. What of someone who expected
progress to be much slower than most of us expect? This person intends to
go into cryonic suspension and come out in a thousand years or so when they
think it will finally be possible to truly become more than human. Why
exclude such a person from being a transhumanist?</a> Where are you going to
draw the line? 500 years? A thousand? Ten thousand? This seems too
arbitrary if you seek a precise academically useful definition.

<p>
<a name="0311qlink2">I have new and improved definitions (see following message). However, I
don't see that your definition is more precise in this area. True, I don't
specify what "limitations" we mean. But "overcoming limits" does clearly
mean an improvement over humans. When you say that "in many ways" (which
ways?) we will no longer be human, this seems to leave the definition just
as unspecified. When you say "no longer human", this is *less* precise that
"overcoming limitations" since we could become no longer human by becoming
animals, by reducing or abolishing some of uniquely human qualities,
becoming subhuman or "inhuman".</a>
