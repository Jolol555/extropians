<i>&gt; rational, capable individuals with acquisitive tendencies.  I'm</i><br>
concerned at
<br>
&gt; how the unhealthy, non-materialistic, and emotional (i.e.,<br>
non-rational)
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink2">&gt; will fare under this system.  </a><br>

<p>
Anarcho-Capitalism deals with fostering an environment of non-coercion
that will allow individuals to trade their abilities and their
services in exchange for those services and products they need or
want.  Many people who are unhealthy and emotional are likely to have
family and friends upon whom they can depend.  Those who do not will
be able to find more charity in a society based on non-coercion (i.e
no taxation).  The charity will often come from businesses, and
businesses that are not at the whim of a few people who control the
flow of money from the top of an oligarchy, are more likely to be
growing.  Hence, they will be looking to fill the ranks of their
business needs and more willing to spend money on training and
education.

<p>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink3">&gt; Anarcho-capitalists also seem overly confident that these alternatives</a><br>
<i>&gt; structures will work, which seems to mirror to an unsettling degree</i><br>
the sort
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink4">&gt; of confidence that early socialist thinkers had in their models.  </a><br>

<p>
Early socialists also assumed that given the option for an ordered,
collective  society, individuals would voluntarily submit to the
demands of the group.  In addition, they believed that goodness and
kindness was an intrinsic property of humanity.  Anarcho-capitalism
does not make that assumption.  Rather it seeks to allow individuals
to regulate other individuals through free trade of goods, of
services, and of information.

<p>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink5">&gt; If anarcho-capitalism really is based upon spontaneous order, we</a><br>
should expect
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink6">&gt; the solutions to non-governance to be as unpredictable and</a><br>
remarkable as the
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink7">&gt; patterns we see in natural systems.</a><br>

<p>
There are dynamics to any complex system.  The beauty of the
anarcho-capitalist model is its flexibility that allows the
participants to correct the system.  The choices are made by
individuals who can cooperate and/or compete.

<p>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink8">&gt; Or maybe they just don't see the status quo as a failure in the</a><br>
sense that
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink9">&gt; you do?  If an anarcho-capitalist society were really that much</a><br>
better, I
<br>
&gt; think you'd have no trouble winning over the masses.  The best way<br>
to speed
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink10">&gt; the death of the state would be to set up a fabulously successful</a><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-capitalist region as a model for the rest of the world.</i><br>

<p>
How about North America? 

<p>
&gt; We've gone around this track several times already.  While I'm<br>
concerned
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink11">&gt; that some people don't want to pay for what I'm doing, there are</a><br>
others that
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink12">&gt; appreciate what I'm doing.  Overall there is not sufficient</a><br>
motivation to
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink13">&gt; quit my job just yet.  If you want things to move more quickly, vote</a><br>
for
<br>
<a href="3120.html#3150qlink14">&gt; libertarian representatives and encourage others to do the same.</a><br>

<p>
The "others" who appreciate what you're doing will surely pay for your
services in a free market, and I will only have to pay for what I need
and want.  We're working on it.
