<a name="0285qlink1"><a href="0256.html#0264qlink1">&gt;In the first type of case, it seems clear that the brain has</a> developed this</a><br>
<a name="0285qlink2"><i>&gt;type of recognitional/experiential capacity to deal with something beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;itself. Why shouldn't the same be true of the second type of</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognitional/experiential capacity? Why would the brain have evolved a</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognitional capacity for something that doesn't actually occur?</i><br>


<p>
Naysayers suggest that the brain developed this capacity to disassociate
as an escape from things like imminent physical death.  I know about the
Pediatrician studying children's NDEs who has suggested that there is a
place in the brain (in the Sylvian fissure of the right temporal lobe) that
is
<br>
triggered during times of tremendous physical stress or at the moment of
death.  He alludes to this bundle of neurons as being our link to the
spiritual
<br>
world.  (sigh)  It seems a bit more parsimonious to assume that intense
levels of anxiety simply trigger dissociative phenomena.  It; probably just
an extension of the flight response.</a>

<a href="0256.html#0264qlink2">&gt;If OBE's are real, then consciousness can survive outside the body, and</a><br>
life
<br>
<a href="0256.html#0264qlink3">&gt;may have a spiritual side.</a><br>


<p>
Yes.  *If* is a big word, of course.

<p>
<a href="0256.html#0264qlink4">&gt;I'm not saying this was Penfield's reasoning......</a><br>


<p>
I don't recall this being his reasoning either, but he does discuss it in
his
<br>
last book written shortly before his own death.
