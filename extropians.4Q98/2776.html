Most people don't realize that 60-70% of the millionaires in the US are
"blue collar" workers.  What's more, old wealth is fairly rare: 75% of all
current millionaires in the US are self-made.  The richest person in my
family is a blue-collar (construction worker, no college) multi-</a>millionaire
who worked hard and started his own construction firm.  Although he doesn't
need to, he still works 70-80 hour work weeks out of habit.

<p>
What I do find interesting is that most people who become millionaires are
not the "white collar" professionals who make considerably more money than
their blue collar counterparts.  I suspect (and I believe studies have
shown) that typical white collar lifestyles are not terribly conducive to
saving the money required to become a millionaire, whereas middle to
lower-middle class workers are habitually frugal and tend to save their
money even when their incomes rise.
