we have a group of scientists and engineers that meet in palo alto every
thursday afternoon at 1600 in lockheed's building 201 where we bring
in experts to give pitches and to discuss various scientific topics.  ive
noticed it is getting more extropian over the past several years.  todays
topic was sending humans to mars.  non-lmco-ers welcome.  if you are in the
neighborhood and want directions, email me offline.  spike66@ibm.net
