<i>&gt;"Is the Death Penalty Extropian?"</i><br>


<p>
No. Probably not.

<p>
Reason: As an extropian it is important to have a rational humanist outlook.
This means that a humans life and time, in other words it's freedom, is the
only thing of real value there is to that human.

<p>
As rationalists and humanists we should ALWAYS strive for a win/win
situation in any human to human conflict. A win/win will not always be
possible, but death penalty makes it shure that there wil be a win/loose
scenario whether the acused/sentenced is guilty or not.

<p>
I am not much for murderers, rapists etc. and instinctively I too feel that
they should be killed for the safety of the rest of society.

<p>
<a name="1669qlink1">Basically any sane, intelligent adult member of society is an assets to
society and adds to the economic surplus.

<p>
<a name="1662qlink1"><a name="1661qlink1">You can argue that a violent criminal is not that, and I would have to
agree. But wouldn't it be better to lock up the criminal until he can be
rewired with nanotech drugs or something else?</a> This way everyone would gain,
</a>
<a name="1662qlink2">and there could be some sort of compensation</a> to the wictims family when the
reformed criminal returned to society.

</a>
<p>
Of course if somebody is uncureable it is another story, but uncurability is
<a name="1662qlink3">a very unextropian concept ... right?
