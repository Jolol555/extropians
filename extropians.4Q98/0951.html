The basic problem would rather seem to be the limited budget, since
for a few k$/unit methinks it is very possible to design a multimedia
gadget to teach literacy interactively/adaptively.

In case of the Arab totalitarians, it would rather suffice to create
video/audio units not requiring conspiquous sat dishes (which would seem to
demand LEO technology) and small enough to hide thus enabling clandestine
use. Surely, the physical and cultural specifics for the Arab
countries can be accounted for. Free market should take care of the rest.

If this is real memetic warfare, aerial deployment (by robot drones,
but who is going to pay for it all?) might be really an option.

<a href="0923.html#0951qlink2"> &gt; Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan once made an interesting</a><br>

<p>
Pretty unlikely. Radio Free Europe was heard primarily for its
information content which was complementary to the remote-controlled
state media. The key to RFE's success was availability of RF receivers.
