<p>
mike, herrnstein and murray produced a very inflammatory book 1994 called
"the bell curve" about intelligence and class structure.  i am not endorsing the
book, but i did find some remarkable conjectures therein, making it worth
my time to read.  havent checked the web.</a>

<p>
<a name="2389qlink2">they site your apparent inverse relationship between spending per student
and sat scores, but explain it differently.  their notion is that


<OL>
  <li>  people segregate themselves by iq, and that
</a>
  <li>  iq can be inherited.


</OL>
<p>
<a name="2389qlink3">immediately one can see why the book is potentially dynamite.  herrnstein and
murray became famous in the 70s by predicting a school's sat scores
based on a formula that accounted only for that school's racial mix,
ignoring altogether parameters such as spending per student, availability of
tutoring etc.  the sat is a very thinly disguised iq test.  wouldnt you agree?</a>

<p>
<a name="2389qlink4">with the existence of this thread, it was only a matter of time before some
yahoo mentioned the bell curve...  spike
