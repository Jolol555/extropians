Moving away from sexuality, it is interesting to speculate on whether we
would like people who were identical to ourselves.  With uploading and
duplication, it may be that we will be able to make copies of ourselves
with ease in the future.  This might be one of the primary forms of
reproduction.<a name="3569qlink1">  You could have an "extended family" of duplicates of
yourself, who have all diverged to various degrees, but who cooperate,
play together, get together for family reunions, and generally support
each other.</a>

<p>
Some people don't seem to be the sort who would get along with copies
of themselves.  An extremely aggressive or selfish person would prefer
the company of others who would be easy to manipulate, and so copies
would lead to conflict.  Someone who was suspicious and paranoid might
develop fears that his copies were conspiring against him.  A person
who was emotionally unstable and prone to mood swings could find them
amplified by being around other people who were the same way.

<p>
Other personalities would be more likely to be self-compatible.  People
who are easy-going, kind, generous and helpful would generally enjoy
being around other people who had the same traits.  Essentially, those
characteristics which help people get along well with others would be
good for self-compatibility.

<p>
There might also be people who have peculiar and anti-social personalities
but who are also self-compatible.  An introvert, shy and withdrawn around
other people, could be very comfortable with his copies.

<p>
Do you think it is better to be the kind of person who gets along with
himself?  Should we strive to be self-compatible?  Is it a sign of a
personality flaw if you would not like your own copies?
