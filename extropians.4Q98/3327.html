<a href="3256.html#3327qlink1">&gt; I briefly noted that one reason to respect Arthur Jensen is his high</a><br>

<i>&gt; Hal Finney  noted that his point</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;isn't Jensen's respectibility, it is Flynn's consistency.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;How can he be so (apparently) sure that Jensen is wrong and still</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, one could respect Einstein without buying into the particular value</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the cosmological constant which he chose. More to the point, one could</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect Einstein's science while deprecating his pacifism (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; vice-versa). I think Flynn, because of his politics, sees the race issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a social construction rather than a testable hypothesis. SO, yes, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are exactly right. Flynn uses science in so far as it reduces the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those whom he opposes politically, but ultimately, because he is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialist rather than an objectivist, he holds the racial issue as</i><br>
<i>&gt; unassailable. Yes, he is inconsistent, and i think that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconsistency will grow rather than diminish as the evidence (in</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular amino-acid sequences related to intelligence) increases.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Regarding the meaning of  score inflation I noted that:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; ...most simply, there are two main alternatives.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Average IQ HAS increased [due to] nutrition ... for instance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hal said</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I would like to see more discussion of this possibility; in particular,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;refutations of the arguments against it.  Superficial arguments like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"where are all the geniuses" are meaningless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed.  This is the central issue in modern intelligence research:</i><br>
<i>&gt; grounding intelligence in a theory rather than in it measure. many people</i><br>
<i>&gt; act as if the "quote" from Boring was true: that intelligence is what the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tests measure. I put quote in quote marks as he did not in face say that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, it would be like physicists regarding the trials in a Wilson cloud</i><br>
<i>&gt; chamber as BEING the sub atomic particles they study.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Work to elucidate the effect is underway in several laboratories around</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. The tests have been made less valid as all children now have 7 years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; of head start at macdonalds (it is the macDonalds place-mat type tests</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; which have shown the greatest grade inflation. This could easily account</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; for the increase in the same way that giving a person the same crossword</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; puzzle every day for  7 years might explain their filling it out rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; rapidly ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This analogy doesn't apply, since the tests are not kept identical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A better analogy would be someone who improves his ability at solving</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;crossword puzzles by working on a great many of them over time.  But in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that case it might well be valid to consider his intelligence increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;as real.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;In a way it seems meaningless to argue about whether intelligence has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;increased.  It comes down to a definition of intelligence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You are right. from the point of view of science, we are seeking to carve</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature at here joints: thus intelligence will be whatever is most able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; explain the data. Intelligence may even disappear as a scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; construct if it is found to have an internal structure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All of this is, as you note, irrelevant for society (well, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrelevant) but supervenient perhaps. What matters is whether we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing the rate of construction of space ships or decreasing it. My</i><br>
<i>&gt; own belief is that most of the variance in this is driven by</i><br>
<i>&gt; demographics. After a period of gross torpor beginning in the 1920s and</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaching a nadir in the 70s, we are now on an upswing that is largely</i><br>
<i>&gt; driven by demographic variables such as large numbers of 20 and 30</i><br>
<i>&gt; something kids all competing with each other by building the smartest new</i><br>
<i>&gt; extension to Linux or way to insert new information into the genome: we</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'ain't seen nothing yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is what Flynn seems to be arguing against when he</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fails to see a new renaissance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; When was the last time that a socialist ever saw a renaissance ;-)</i><br>

<p>
uh, 1917-1924?

<p>
<a href="3256.html#3327qlink2">&gt; These people specialise in gloom: they were cribbing in Moorish Spain, in</a><br>
<i>&gt; the middle of Elizabeth's golden age and they still complain today.</i><br>

<p>
Sure, if they didn't they'd have to find productive jobs.

<p>
<a href="3256.html#3327qlink3">&gt; Like Jim Watson said: "some people just always pick the wrong answer."</a><br>
<i>&gt;   DNA? Nah, that 'll never work ;-)</i><br>

<p>
Unfortunately its easy to still make money picking the wrong answer. Its just
called art, so it doesn't need to be right.
