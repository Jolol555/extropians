This may be so, but you have yet to prove that killing a murderer is
wrong. Since the original judaeic laws (the Commandments) upon which our
western value system are based stated 'thou shalt not murder' (not the
erroneous 'thou shalt not kill') then only murder is wrong under our
western value system. Killing a murderer is not murder, when done either
in self defense or as the result of trial by ones peers. Therefore, two
wrongs have not been commited. More like one right cancels out one
wrong.
