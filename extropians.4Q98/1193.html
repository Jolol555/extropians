No, that is not guaranteed, but this goes back to defining transhumanism as
both an area of philosophy and an area of endeavor.  While the endeavors
related to transhumanism can result in actions based in bigotry, the
philosophy of transhumanism itself does not support such viewpoints and
rather proposes more positive uses for technological progress.  Not everyone
who engages in scientific or technological progress also agrees with the
philosophical aspect of transhumanism, that is why we rely on the
declaration of individuals to distinguish who might agree with transhumanist
philosophy and who might not.

As for South Carolina, well, I grew up there and you've barely scratched the
surface of its backwardness.  I consider my years there a strong object
lesson in the memes that I do not want to see continue.
