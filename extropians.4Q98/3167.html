<p>
  Hello all...    forgive any naivety in this first post .. .. .


<p>
  I am pro-genetic engineering, giving evolution a kick up the ass and all
that..
<br>
  but, since total godhood is still some time away, I would just like to throw
out 
<br>
  some ideas re: the functionality of human cloning...  (since it's here and
now)

<p>
   the question is not "can it be done?"   
   the question is not "will it be done?"    
 
<p>
    my question is "what is it good for?"

<p>
<a name="3182qlink1">   if clones become a preferrable alternative to children, it seems that all 
   physical evolution would suddenly come to a virtual stand-still . . .  
   no losses . .   no gains. . .   just the same genetic material over and
</a>over . . ..
   
<p>
   yes, i know it is unlikely that all natural child-reproduction would cease,
   but undoubtedly the random(ish)-selection involved in gene-mixing would
slow...


<p>
   thoughts on this?
 

<p>
   (and now the more radical part of my post)<br>


<p>
<a name="3182qlink2">   Since clones would basically be 'us', they must be given the same 
   basic rights etc. as everyone else.. . .   including the right to breed.</a> .
..
<p>
   right?
 
<p>
   (consider 'clones have the right to breed' to be point #1)<br>



<p>
   &lt;&lt;switching lines of thought&gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="3182qlink3">   Can a 'clone' of yourself be manipulated to the opposite sex?
   I imagine they must be able to be..  as regular humans can be...
   and the earlier in development this occurs the easier it is.. (pre-natal
even)</a>
   
<p>
   (consider 'you can create a clone of yourself in the opposite sex' point<br>
#2)


<p>
    do you see where i'm going yet?


<p>
    assumption:  a great deal of what we call personality/character/nature
<pre>
                        is determined by genetics . . . .


<a name="3383qlink1"><a name="3347qlink1"><a name="3182qlink4">     Want the truely 'perfect mate'?   someone just like you?     
       the answer is obvious...  CREATE A FUCKABLE CLONE!!</a>     
</a>
</a>
      

</pre>
<p>
  . .. . well, the answer's not that simple...    with clones having full
civil-rights
<p>
      i'm not speaking of sex-slaves or anything like that...

<pre>
     investing would be a gamble....   
      but, chances are good, you're not going to reject 'yourself' .  . .

     (consider 'you could breed with your own genetic material' to be point
</pre>
#3)


     
<p>
    I think anyone with a basic understanding of science and psychology
    knows that this will eventually happen..   and will appeal to a large
number
<p>
    of lonely human-beings . .. 


<p>
<a name="3182qlink5">    Now, it turn it over to those with a better understanding of genetics . .
.
<p>
    this sounds like ultimate inbreeding to me . . .   is there danger in it?
    or is a couple like this only going to give birth to what is basically 
    another clone?</a>

    

<p>
    curious,
