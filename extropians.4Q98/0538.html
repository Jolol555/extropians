In the journal "Nature" (12/14/73), Dr. Edward Tryon presented
the theory that the sum of all energy in the universe is zero.
Below is the mathematics behind that theory, quoted from the 
paper  "Genesis of The Universe and Zero Point Energy" [*] 
(I would be very interested to hear any critiques of it):  


<pre>
     "In 1973 the great contemporary scientific 
     thinker Edward P. Tryon demonstrated how the 
     universe could have formed [ from nothing ] 
     without violating the principle of the 
     conservation of energy.  He said that the 
     total energy of the universe is zero. [1]

     He said that the positive energy of the things 
     we observe is balanced by a negative gravitational 
     energy.  Therefore the creation was formed without 
     violating the principle of the conservation of 
     energy.  Let's explore his idea. When something 
     falls it loses gravitational potential energy. 
     The relationship between potential energy and 
     position, in a force field, is given by equation #1.

     /\ PE = W  = - | F . dr                     Eq #1
              g     |  g 
                   /

     According to Tryon's theory if an object were to 
     fall into the universe from an infinite distance 
     away, the gravitational potential energy the object 
     lost would equal the total mass energy of the object.
     [2] This is stated mathematically in equation #2:


              / rad of univ
              | -&gt;   -&gt;
     mc^2 = - | F  . dr                         Eq #2
              |  g
              /infinity 


     Assuming that the universe is spherical with an 
     isotopic mass distribution, the amount of gravita-
     tional potential an object will lose upon falling to 
     the edge of such a universe is given by equation #3.


                        / rad of univ
                       |
     mc^2 = -(G)(M)(m) | (1/r^2)  dr             Eq #3
                       | 
                      /infinity


     Given a radius of the universe is 15 billion light 
     years (1.42x10^26 meters) and the known gravitational 
     constant G, the mass of the universe may be determined.

     M = 1.91 x 10^53    KG  

     If this is the mass of the universe then the total 
     energy of the universe is zero.  To check this result 
     the mass of the universe was calculated from its den-
     sity and volume. The universe was considered to be a 
     sphere.  This sphere has a radius of 15 billion light 
     years and is filled with matter of the same density as 
     the density of space in our galactic neighborhood.  
     This "local" density is equivalent to one proton of 
     ordinary matter and nine protons of "dark" matter 
     per cubic meter. [3]

     Given that the volume of a sphere with a radius of 15
     billion light years =  1.2 x 10^79   M^3

     Please note that at one proton mass per cubic meter 
     this is also the number of protons in the universe.  
     The mass of the universe was derived from its volume 
     and density in equation #4.
                                                   Eq#4

     M = ((1 proton/m^3) +(9 proton masses dark matter/m^3))(vol) 


     The mass of the universe according to this second 
     argument is:

     M = 2.00 x 10^53     KG

     Amazingly the resultant masses agree even though they 
     were determined by two entirely different methods.  
     This agreement indicates that the universe has a total 
     energy of zero and that it formed without violating 
     the principle of the conservation of energy.  There 
     is something very profound in what Edward Tryon said.

     CONCLUSION

     New scientific arguments have shown how something can
     be created out of nothing.  These arguments have tre-
     mendous philosophical implications.  ...

     NOTES

     [1] Edward P. Tryon, NATURE VOL 246, December 14, 1973.

     [2] Technically, nothing can exist outside of the 
     universe. The universe is a closed structure in which, 
     according to the cosmological principle, all positions 
     are equivalent.  The model presented in this paper, in 
     which an object falls from an infinite distance away to 
     the edge of the universe, does not represent reality.  
     The model does, however, allow for the calculation of 
     the negative gravitational potential shared by all 
     objects within the universe.

     [3] Fritz Zwicky proposed that 90% of the matter in the
     universe is "dark" in 1933.  He came to this conclusion
     from the study of clusters of galaxies.
     Vera Rubin confirmed that 90% of the universe's matter
     is composed of the so called "dark matter" from her study
     of the rotational speeds of galaxies in 1977."

 NOTE: I changed the awkward use of exponents as mc
 to the more standard ascii-style exponent notation: mc^2.
 I also took the liberty to insert footnote 2 where it seems
 to be properly indicated, since it never appears in the text.
 I also placed the footnote-numbers in brackets, for clarity.
