And to add more Catholic trivia that you never wanted to know, the
<a name="2011qlink1">Immaculate Conception refers not to the conception of Jesus, but to the
conception of Mary.  That is, Mary herself was conceived miraculously,
not through sexual relations, and her conception (the moment when
Mary's mother became pregnant) is called the Immaculate Conception.</a>
The conception of Jesus is apparently called the Holy Conception, and
his birth, the Virgin Birth.

<p>
<a name="2011qlink2">Although Mary was conceived miraculously, the miracle was such</a> that
she was the biological child of both her father and her mother.</a>  Jesus,
on the other hand, was the biological child only of Mary, and Joseph
played no part in his biological lineage.

<p>
The parallels to the capabilities of modern and near-future fertility
technologies are intriguing but probably not significant!
