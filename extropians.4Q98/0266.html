Except that the Eskimo, Inuit, Laplanders, and other longer term inhabitants do
not have such a high level of depression. Only the latecomers (i.e. since the
aryan migration) have such a high level of depression. This indicates that such
inhabitants have not yet adapted to the high latitudes. Remember that depression
leads to a lowered interest in sex,<a name="0282qlink2"> so a depressed individual would be less
likely to reproduce....no matter how much time spent inside.</a> Also, since people
with an SAD problem are more likely to want to get out in the rare sun at high
latitudes (since the light does alleviate their problems), they would be more
likely to freeze to death or get eaten by predators...

Until 10,000 years ago, the ice sheets stretched down to the Black Sea and
Wisconsin, so I wouldn't expect the cold to be a factor...
