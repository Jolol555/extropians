<a name="0447qlink1">This notion of instantaneous transmission of "encoded" information doesn't
strike me as a very good analogy.</a>

<p>
<a name="0447qlink2">For one thing, the "speed" of transmission is potentially more than
instantaneous.  If you insist on thinking of this as transmission</a> of
information, the problem is that it can go into the past as well.  It
<a name="0447qlink3">can even go into the past light cone of the "transmitter", which makes
it faster than "faster than light".

</a>
<p>
Also (or equivalently), there is no well defined moment of reception.
Particularly in the case of quantum teleportation, where you are not
making measurements of the receiving system, you can't point to a time
at which the information was received.  You almost want to say that the
information travelled backwards in time to the point where the reception
particle was created, then forward with that particle throughout its
lifetime until the teleportation was done.

<p>
<a name="0447qlink4">There are enough differences from what we normally mean by the phrase
that I don't think it is useful to call this phenomenon "transmission of
information" at all.
