Why? ;)... well in fact yes... such subjects attracts me like black
holes .... I've so few possibilities to discuss it and got new ideas

<p>
YES!!!!! ;)I'm happy to see that pointed out...

<p>
Non-physical equals non-existing in our universe (witch can be
considered as a closed system)... isn't?

<i>&gt; this</i><br>
<i>&gt; just pushes back the issue of `freedom of the will' into a mysterious</i><br>
<i>&gt; impalpable black box,</i><br>

<p>
As you have said previously, quantum uncertainty can't logically be
where FW is hiding, you can't choose for yourself the result of an
observable before making the experiment.

<p>
<i>&gt; and one for which we have no independent evidence.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2009.html#2013qlink5">&gt; (But if there is anything to the claims of lab evidence for psi, which</a><br>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
What I think, is that "free will" like the " I " concept, is just an
useful heuristic that has been embedded in our brains during darwinian
evolution. When we believe in "free will", we are somewhat better
adapted to the world.

<p>
So "free will" is a very useful mere illusion. If you accept that our
universe function according to some laws, knowable or not, or even if
from time to time doesn't obey to laws... we can't absolutely not tamper
with  ;)... because we are just the products of these laws in action, of
this dam dynamically evolutive universe.

<p>
We are the products of the interactions of the objects that compose us
and our surrounding.
<br>
If I want something, if I have a goal, it's because of my Machinery and
his interactions with his surrounding.

<p>
Every moment, you can't think or wish something that is not, at least,
physically compatible with the previous moment.

<p>
Probably "free will" as an illusion is not about physics, but just pure
mathematical causal logic.

<p>
Like the " I " concept and 'free will", transhumanism/extropianism are
useful sets of memes that somewhat transform you gradually, for
example,  in a more adaptive, thinking and knowledgeable person, at
least if you have been exposed to ....
