Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE: To compare lipid-altering effects of an almond-based diet with an
  olive oil-based diet, against a cheese and butter-based control diet.
  METHODS: Forty-five free-living hyperlipidemic men (n = 12) and women (n =
  33) with a mean plasma total cholesterol (TC) of 251 +/- 30 mg/dL followed
  one of three diets; almond-based, olive oil-based, or dairy-based for 4
  weeks. Total fat in each diet was matched, and the study-provided sources of
  fat comprised the major portion of fat intake. RESULTS: Reductions in TC and
  low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) between the three groups were
  significantly different from the almond group (both p &lt; 0.001). Within group
  analysis revealed that the almond-based diet induced significant reductions
  in TC (p &lt; 0.05), LDL-C (p &lt; 0.001), and the TC:HDL ratio (p &lt; 0.001), while
  HDL-C levels were preserved. TC and HDL-C in the control diet were
  significantly increased from baseline (both p &lt; 0.05), while the olive
  oil-based diet resulted in no significant changes over the study period.
  Weight did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the
  more favorable lipid-altering effects induced by the almond group may be due
  to interactive or additive effects of the numerous bioactive constituents
  found in almonds.
