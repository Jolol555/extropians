A link from the page I gave earlier leads to:
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/braunstein.html">http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/braunstein.html</a>
which describes "classical" teleportation by scanning and re-creation.

<p>
The author makes an interesting point about the question of whether the
quantum state of particles is important in the body:

<p>
<i>: What about the "quantum state" of those atoms? Does it matter what energy</i><br>
<i>: levels they are all in? Do the chemical reactions need to have this</i><br>
<i>: information to work once we reassemble the atoms to make a person? Well,</i><br>
<i>: my best guess is no! As is the best guess of several other scientists</i><br>
<i>: I've asked too. But that's hardly a definitive answer. I guess what</i><br>
<i>: tends to convince me that the detailed quantum state is not important</i><br>
<i>: to get right when you want to copy a person and make a new one from the</i><br>
<i>: partial information is that people routinely go to hospitals for NMR</i><br>
<i>: (nuclear magnetic resonance) and ESR (electron spin resonance) scans</i><br>
<i>: to see inside them. These procedures mix up the quantum states of at</i><br>
<i>: least some large number of atoms and nuclei of the people being scanned,</i><br>
<i>: yet it doesn't seem to disturb their appetites (that makes them still</i><br>
: human in my book). Thus here again the quantum nature of our atoms and<br>
: molecules doesn't appear to rule out the copying method for teleportation.<br>

<p>
This appears to be evidence against Roger Penrose's theories that
quantum coherence is a necessary element of brain operation.  From what
I understand, people in these machines don't feel anything happening as
their quantum states are scrambled.  If long-range quantum correlations
were involved in thought and consciousness, it seems like these kinds
of scanners would cause noticeable disruption.
