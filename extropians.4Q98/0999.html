Hi Max

<p>
Michael Lorrey suggested
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people have the quirky notion that you can make everything</i><br>
<a href="0989.html#0999qlink1">&gt;&gt;equal for everyone without stealing anything from anybody, or annoying</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;anyone</i><br>

<p>
To which Max replied

<p>
<a name="1008qlink1"><i>&gt;... I find it is fair to steal money [to]</i><br>
<a href="0989.html#0999qlink2">&gt;"Making the rich 2% unhappier to make the poor 200% happier"</a></a><br>

<p>
That is Marx in a nutshell: property is theft, ergo theft is justice.
Unfortunately,even in the Utilitarian cloths in which you dress your 
wolf, the sums don't compute.

<p>
<a name="1008qlink2">Take a miniature country like NZ or Denmark. They are both 100 Billion 
dollar economies. Bill gates could give us a holiday for 180 days, then 
all his money is gone.</a>
 
<p>
<a name="1008qlink3">Add up all the other rich people and your sentence becomes

<p>
"take all the wealth form the rich and make everyone happy for about 1 
</a>day."
 
<p>
<a name="1008qlink4"><a href="0989.html#0999qlink3">&gt;taking money away from the wealthy and</a><br>
<i>&gt;investing them in other peoples education/helping the poor can eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt;make the wealthier even wealthier.</i><br>

<p>
Nope. It just makes people stop work. Galt's Gulch. There are quite nice 
equations for this now. In New Zealand the Treasury suggests that the 
optimal tax rate to maximise GNP and government income is in the mid 20s.</a>

<p>
<a name="1008qlink5"><a href="0989.html#0999qlink4">&gt;btw. I am considdered to be right wing here in Denmark :-)</a><br>
<a name="1000qlink1">I guess that is because people forget that Denmark had an explicit 
eugenics program to enhance the IQ of its population ;-) Skin heads 
keeping out "inferior" colours of immigrant is also</a> suggests 
</a>

<p>
<a name="1008qlink6">In truth, Denmark has little to fear from socialism. Your people are so 
honest and intelligent that the whole system is highly self organising. I 
thoroughly enjoyed both my trips to Copenhagen and Aarhus for that 
reason. I recognised immediately why Denmark's Jewish population mostly 
survived the Nazis: Danes are decent human beings.</a>

<p>
best,
