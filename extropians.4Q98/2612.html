Yes of course, but only for a minute or two during the most intense part of reentry.
Interpolation techniques along with some accelerometers can take up the slack for the
interim.

<p>
Yes, the identity of the sub may be unknown, then again maybe not. I do know that with
current microphone technology we can identify the type of sub from across the pacific
ocean (the mikes were developed for high fidelity listening to whale songs, but got
<a name="2643qlink1">coopted by the Navy). Additionally, every missile type has its own sonic, chemical, and
</a>
trajectory signatures, and every type of warhead has its own signature in terms of
radiation emissions, yeild, and seismic signature.

<p>
The technology to intercept terminal stage warheads has already been demonstrated. Since
China is not a signtory to the ABM treaty, once there is one instance of another nation
using large ballistic warheads on cities with a large death toll, then Russia will
probably fold its objections to the US deploying more Star Wars technologies. I do know
that the Phalanx anti-aircraft gun has been tested in modified form as a radar guided
terminal interception system. It works quite well, though it puts a lot of metal in the
air which come down eventually....
