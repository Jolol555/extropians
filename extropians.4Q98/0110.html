Abstract
<br>
  We have previously demonstrated that a hypocaloric, nutritionally deficient,
  liquid protein diet is associated with potentially life-threatening cardiac
  arrhythmias, which increased in frequency and complexity over the duration of
  the study. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the metabolic
  and cardiac changes associated with a hypocaloric, but otherwise
  nutritionally complete, diet. Six healthy, obese females from 154 to 182
  percent of ideal body weight were evaluated in a metabolic ward for 48 days.
  The subjects ingested a weight maintenance diet during an eight-day period,
  which was followed by 40 days of an experimental diet containing 472 kcal of
  a mixture of protein (60 percent of calories), carbohydrate (25 percent), and
  fat (15 percent). This diet equaled or exceeded the recommended daily
  allowances for minerals, trace elements, vitamins, and
  essential fatty acids. The subjects were monitored for balances of nitrogen
  and minerals, as well as for the appearance of cardiac
  arrhythmias by 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings. Nitrogen balance was
  positive, and the previously demonstrated negative balances for potassium,
  sodium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were either reversed or markedly
  decreased. In contrast to our previous study, no arrhythmias were observed in
  subjects ingesting the present experimental diet, and no significant change
  in cardiac rhythm was found in 13 obese, but otherwise healthy, outpatients.
  The data, based on a limited number of subjects, suggest that a hypocaloric
  diet vigorously supplemented with essential elements, micronutrients, and
  vitamins appears to be safer than the once popular, incomplete liquid protein
  preparation.
