Hi Peter et al.,

<br>
<a href="1532.html#1562qlink2">&gt;Do you have a referrence on this?  Calvin explicitly claims this hypothesis</a><br>

<a name="1579qlink1">Just going from memory re the content of this paper, but this is, I 
believe, the source. Of course it may data back even further?</a>

<p>
Previc FH.(1991) A general theory concerning the prenatal origins of 
cerebral lateralisation in humans. Psychological Review.98:299-334.

<p>
<a name="1579qlink2">I don't believe it. There seems to be a consensus, however, that the 
origins of which side got chosen to be the left/language/generative 
grammar side are probably incidental to _some_  artifact of this nature.</a> 
<a name="1579qlink3">Doesn't really matter too much, I suspect.</a> The big thing is that the 
world is constructed as generative objects on the left and as synthetic 
spatial maps on the right.
