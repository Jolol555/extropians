But as usual that's largely due to the barriers that government regulations
put in the way of new companies. In the UK -- where pretty much anyone 
can set themselves up as an auto manufacturer -- there are dozens of small 
manufacturers, some selling complete cars, others selling them as kits for 
home assembly. The cars are usually cheap and idiosyncratic, but they're
often much better for their target market than the usual models from Ford
or GM.

<p>
Interestingly, one such car is the only one I know of allowed to compete 
in rallies without a roll-cage -- the body is so strong that it doesn't 
need one -- and the old Jensen FF, with ABS and permanent 4WD back in the 
late 60s, couldn't be sold in the US because Jensen weren't willing to 
smash up two cars to pass US safety regs; in terms of production numbers 
that would be equivalent to Ford smashing half a million Escorts. So US 
safety regs *prevented* the sale of the safest car in the world at the 
time.

<p>
But then that's government for you...
