If you give folks the option to spend a part of their tax money as
they see fit, then you're further legitimizing taxation even further. 
What's the difference between directing 30% of my stolen (taxed)
income towards space funding and voluntarily donating a similar
unstolen amount?  One is coerced, the other isn't.

<p>
Allowing you to choose how your tax money is spent is like being
mugged and having the mugger promise to spend a portion on whatever
you like.  That's nonsense.

<p>
Any attempt to look at taxation as anything other than government
thievery is helping the government steal more of our money.  Also
remember any plans to allow us to direct our own tax monies would
create more huge bureaucracies which would tend to eat up a good
portion of that money anyway.

<p>
Taxation is theft.  Nothing more.
