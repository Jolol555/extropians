Making sure you got woken up is easy in a free market. Simply post on
public boards the notice that you will pay such and so a reward to the
first third party that makes sure you get woken up at the proper time.
I'm sure there are plenty of law offices that could automate the
boilerplate paperwork to ensure the cryo organization is legally
accountable to someone other than the patient to ensure the patients
revival.  Lawyers can be very good friends for hire, given the proper
inducement.
