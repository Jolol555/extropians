Because:

<a name="2581qlink2">  <li>  objects in ballistic trajectories tend to trip major alarms in the HQ's of the
Strategic Nuclear command centers...</a>

  <li>  a Tomahawk can fly under the radar pattern of most countries self defense
networks, giving the attack the element of surprise, which is much more usefull.

  <li>  an object in a ballistic trajectory needs a much faster responding guidance
system than just GPS. GPS is good for merely confirming course waypoints, but not
useful for second by second course and thrust corrections that determine the
accuracy of a ballistic weapon.

  <li>  the Tomahawk now has multi-mission capability, negating the advantage that a
ballistic weapon can have with MIRV warheads. The latest model, the TLAM-D, can
carry four warheads which can be independently dropped automatically at programmed
waypoints. With a 1000 statute mile range, a Tomahawk can attack widely spaced
targets with precision, while a ballistic missile's MIRV is limited to attacking
targets in  a small area.

  <li>  the next model is supposed to have hunt and kill capabilities to attack mobile
targets like SCUD or SAM launchers within a given area. Useful for targets that the
satellites said were at a given point x minutes ago.

As for THEL, well I like laser guns as much as anybody, but anything that is line
of sight can be attacked by the attackee. Put a THEL on the moon and next thing you
know every nation is gonna have its own pet Russian laser scientist....

<p>
Lasers are best used as a means of destroying the other guys ability to see whats
on the battlefield. Wiping out the other guys satellites, radar dishes, etc just
before you attack with a force from over the horizon not only gives you surprise,
but an overwhelming advantage in C3I during the battle. Its merely an extension of
electronic warfare.
