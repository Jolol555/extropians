<p>
How is that? How can I deprive somebody of something he doesn't have?

<p>
Why can't they rent mining rights from the "bugger"? You're assuming that
the bugger somehow posesses everything of value, and "they" have nothing.
Why?

<p>
<a href="2951.html#2975qlink7">&gt;They can't live on spot X as someone else has cordoned it off, built a</a><br>
city
<br>

<p>
How do you propose that land be fairly allocated in the absense of property
rights? By drawing lots? By the whim of some "authority"?
