<p>
Additionally, as he saw it, he was acting against a government which had
exceeded its Constitutional limits. As a veteran, I can tell you that those in
the military service which are very patriotic take very seriously their oath to
"serve and protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign AND DOMESTIC."
The same Constitution also states that the US Gov't can't own any property
outside of the District of Columbia. They excape this clause by 'holding in
trust' property in the states, for the 'people'. They build buildings and other
facilities but pay no rent to the states, nor property taxes where these
facilities are based.

<p>
As McVeigh and others like him, they see the federal government as being
illegal since it ignores the limits of the Constitution, so it must be removed
and replaced with one that does. Since the two parties which have a
stranglehold on the election process, and since there is not means of holding
national referendums, nor any way for most states to secede from the union,
they see the only option left being military.

<p>
Since they feel there is only a military option left, then they are bound by
the laws of War, which state that any employee or facility employed, owned or
occupied by an enemy target is a legitimate military target. So by this logic,
the federal building in OK city was a ligitimate target. The children in the
day care center could be thought of as merely voluntary hostages of the
government to protect the building, but they were considered non-combatants,
and McVeigh is responsible for bombing the building while he knew they were
there as a War Crime. A legitimate attack would have happened at night when
there was the lowest possiblity of innocent civilians being in the building.

<p>
I was rather surprised that he did not include this argument in his defense as
a political statement, but apparently his defense lawyers wanted to try to
avoid the death penalty, which they could not have in the above scenario.

The problem, Mr. Webb, is that ethically, you are a collaborator. Whether you
do the dirty work or not, you are still part of the same organization, and
under the precendents set in the legal system, the right hand does not need to
know or approve of what the left hand is doing to be found guilty of being an
acessory and co-conspirator. This precendent was set by your organization in a
case meant to go after an illegal organization which also likes to consider
itself a government, known as the mafia.
