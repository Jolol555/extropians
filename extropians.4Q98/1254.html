<a name="1322qlink1"><a name="1296qlink1">i don't understand why we're talking about humanism, morality, and 
compassion on a listserv dominated by libertarians and objectivists.</a></a> 
<a name="1296qlink2">many of the policies people advocate on this listserv indicate to me 
that they don't care about people other than themselves. a posthumanist 
world could very well consist of temporary 
autonomous zones (taz) where everyone would be free to do as they please. 
with the proper technology anarchy and absolute liberty would be possible. 
but how are we going to get there? will it be through cooperation and 
sacrifice or will it be through ruthless competition. i believe that most 
<a name="1438qlink1">of the people on the list are out of touch with reality. have you ever 
been on the other side of the policies you advocate?</a> and if you have 
been fucked over, is it really a mature and rational response to attempt 
to fuck over others. i think not. thanks.
