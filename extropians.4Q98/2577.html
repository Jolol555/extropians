My parents have given 5% of their income to Catholic Charities and the catholic
Church their entire working lives. I'm sure if they were not taxed so much, they
would give more. They are not very wealthy at all, they are hard working
professionals who are struggling to put together a decent retirement nest egg now
that all of the kids are out on their own.

<p>
I have frequently done volunteer work in the past. I would guesstimate that I've
done at least several thousand hours of volunteer work in my life so far.

<a href="2553.html#2577qlink2">&gt; So... I am somewhat concerned that voluntary charity will raise much less</a><br>

<p>
Its a matter of the amount of money and volunteer time given times the
utilization coefficient increasing the actual value of the donated resources.
Governments are heinous wasters of money on welfare programs. Moreover, most
private charities try to build up sizable endowments to earn investment income
off of, so they can maintain a long term level of spending. Governments almost
never do this, they just chuck it out the door as fast as possible.

<p>
Hardly. Some of the best hospitals are run by religious groups, and do an amazing
lavel of charitable work as they can. Religious affiliated hospitals have more
than twice the level of charitable health care work than secular non-profit
hospitals.

<p>
You must have been badly treated as a child. Without having to pay 60% of their
income in direct and indirect taxation, everyone would be able to afford better
private health care policies, and those who were more wealthy would be able to
donate a greater percentage of their income to provide health care to lower
income people.
