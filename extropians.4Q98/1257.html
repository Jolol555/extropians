<a href="1255.html#1257qlink1">&gt;Today, if someone goes out and surveys the literature,</a><br>
<i>&gt;and gathers a lot of data, then publishes a book arguing on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;basis of that data that, say, Asians are generally all-around</i><br>
<i>&gt;smarter than Caucasians, those people are called racists. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Rationality is irrelevant to the label.</i><br>

<p>
Discrimination, since some of the members of the set are not
smarter. To generalize them together on the basis of race is to
show bias.

<p>
<a href="1255.html#1257qlink2">&gt;The only way not to be a racist today is to say that race and</a><br>
<i>&gt;genetics makes no difference in behavior or intelligence or</i><br>
<i>&gt;strength. Someone who regards themselves as genetically transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt;has taken the critical step of acknowledging that genetics makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;a difference.</i><br>

<p>
Genetic's may make a difference in peoples abilities, but not in
how they should be treated.

<p>
<a href="1255.html#1257qlink3">&gt;I am not saying that the term "racist" is being applied</a><br>
<i>&gt;incorrectly. I think it is correct.  Someone who believes there</i><br>
<i>&gt;are or can be significant observable behavioral differences</i><br>
<i>&gt;correlated with race is a racist.  And anyone who considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves transhuman would necessarily believe that.  Once you</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe that, it would be inconsistent not to consider that there</i><br>
<i>&gt;might be behavioral differences between other human races, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;once you consider that, you are a racist at heart.</i><br>

<p>
I don't agree, it is discriminatory (not a good thing) to group
together on the basis of race, sex, sexual preference, or religion,
but unless you show prejudice, it is not racist.

<p>

<p>
People deserve to be treated equally/fairly.</a>
