Not necessarily. It can pay those who wish to be able to defend</a> themselves the
<a name="2856qlink2">right to do so provided they also act  as undercover deputized security
personnel, responsible to defend others in a criminal or other security
situation. This is essentially what is happening in states</a> with right-to-carry
<a name="2856qlink3">concealed weapons laws, as private citizens carrying concealed weapons</a> act as an
<a name="2856qlink4">implied and unknown threat against potential criminals, thus acting to deter
crime against all, and benefitting the PPF. Under the US Constitution, all
individuals between the ages of 18 and 40 are members of the militia</a> who can be
<a name="2856qlink5">drawn on by local law enforcement personnel as deputies to form</a> posse's for the
<a name="2856qlink6">purpose of fighting local crime. These are two examples of self defense</a> in a PPF
situation.
