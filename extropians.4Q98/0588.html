To get a good model of how beliefs change, we first need a good model of how
beliefs are held. My current area of research is people's beliefs about web
sites. In particular, what makes for a fast web site. There is much that is
measurable about this situation, but no accepted solution short of "lots of fast
hardware".  Some commonly held beliefs about the Web are measurably false.

<p>
 My theory is that people are lazy. A meme that would be a lot of work to
accomodate, or invalidate a lot of work already invested, is usually rejected.
People who have invested a lot raising children from a genetic lottery may be
resistant to others "cheating" and having geneticaly certain offspring. If that
is so, the theory predicts parents of children would be more likely anti-cloning
than single people. And parents of genetically handicapped children would be
more resistant than parents of normal children. I wonder if there are already
any surveys out there that could validate this?

<p>
 On the web server project, I would predict that beliefs that minimize the
effort for web masters are the most likely to be taken up. The "more hardware"
belief is a cheap one for most webmasters, as it passes the effort up to the
executive level that decides budget. Another cheap belief is that delivery
delays are due to net backbone congestion. This doesn't stand up to measurement,
but does take the pressure off the local webmaster.
