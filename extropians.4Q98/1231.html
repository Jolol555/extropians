<p>
There's a lot of neural hardware supporting things like bigotry, which a smart
transhuman would disable if at all possible.  Saying that a transhuman is a
bigot "by definition" implies a lot of connotations which may be absent -
hatred, smugness, prejudices.  Are you a bigot because you consider yourself
"superior" to chimpanzees?  No - you don't fear or hate them, and you don't
exult in your superiority.  If you did, you'd be a bigot, with all the correct
negative connotations of implied, and it doesn't matter that the assertions
generating your emotions would be correct.

<p>
I would define bigotry as a condition testing for a certain set of evolved
human emotions, and not as a condition testing relational assertions of ability.
