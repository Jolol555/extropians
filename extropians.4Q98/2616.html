confusion for me.  Perhaps somebody could clear it up.  I have been
reading the arhives for about a month, so I know there is little all
extropians agree on, but I find it interesting that books marked as
recommended reading in Max More's Extropian Principles 2.6 clearly
lists three books of note:
<br>

<i>&gt; Timothy Leary's:  InfoPsychology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Infopsychology?

out what seems to be a rather sharp division between some peoples

reading.  My time is limited, so could somebody clarify what I'm
missing here.

Well, it's never too early to start thinking for yourself.  :) 
There's several books on Max's list that aren't entirely Extropian.  
I'd be willing to bet that not a single one of them is.  I think the
point is that each book contains at least a kernel of something useful.

<p>
Example:  Stephen Covey's "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective
People" is an excellent book and contains lots of good info for
becoming a more powerful individual, but it's FULL of
religious/christian undertones that are markedly non-Extropian.

<p>
Lot's of us on here have differing opinions about lots of things, but
the important thing is to remember that only in the market place of
argument can memes evolve.

<p>
I'd suggest reading at least the top ten books that Max has listed and
then explore as many of the others as possible.
