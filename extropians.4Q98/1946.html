Don't worry Mark, I stopped taking this thread and Den Otter seriously when he
first jumped in to the Death Penalty debate (see my response to his first
post).  His views are so absurd, I couldn't respond to anything else he said
because my stomach was hurting from laughing too hard.</a>  I stopped laughing when
I realized he was actually serious, which in the end makes it all the more
laughable.
