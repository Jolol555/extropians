<i>&gt;reason to attack you personally. I'm sure you're sincere in believing that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the job you do is valuable. I'm just so f***in' tired of being jerked</i><br>
<i>&gt;around by "the system" that I tend to lash out at anyone I see as</i><br>
<i>&gt;representing it. Unfortunately, the fact is that your position _is_</i><br>
<i>&gt;supported by funds that are, from my point of view, simply extorted from me</i><br>
<i>&gt;and others who have other uses for our own money. Hope you understand my</i><br>
<i>&gt;discontent with that situation.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3085qlink1">I understand that you feel this way.  There definitely does seem to be
something wrong with forcing people to pay for things they don't need or
</a>want.  Speaking only for myself, I really don't mind paying taxes, so I
don't have any moral objection to working for the government.  It has its
benefits and its drawbacks.  Soon I hope to return to the private sector,
though I am somewhat concerned about the demands that may be made on my
time.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink2">&gt;&gt;The notion that all men (people) are created equal is arguably not well</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;supported by market mechanisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the market is the most egalitarian social phenomenon possible, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;that every person has absolute say over whether to participate in any given</i><br>
<i>&gt;transaction.</i><br>

<p>
David Friedman made this claim in _Machinery of Freedom_.  I agree that
<a name="3085qlink2">market outcomes are most efficient, but I'm not totally convinced that these
outcomes are most fair.</a>  They seem to favor those with an acquisitive
disposition.  For example, suppose person A offers a parcel of land for
sale.  The potential buyers include person B, who's willing to pay $1,000
for it, and persons C..Z who collectively are willing to pay $100,000.  But
while Person A has $1,000 in the bank, persons C..Z are non-materialistic
"hippies" who feel very passionate about preserving the ecosystem on this
land but can only scrape together $100.  So person A wins, even though the
land is 100 times more important to the hippies.  Friedman covers a similar
case in his book but I really didn't follow his logic.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink3">&gt;&gt;In any event, "global capitalism" is what economists and business leaders</a><br>
<i>&gt;call it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's what *some" economists call it, specifically those who favor</i><br>
<i>&gt;interventionism. Technically, it's a form of mercantilism.</i><br>

<p>
The global capital market definitely has its mercantilist aspects.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink4">&gt;&gt;Ah yes, we're one big happy gang here.  Have you ever even *been* to DC?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How is that relevant? The point I was undiplomatically making is that your</i><br>
<i>&gt;job, like all gov't jobs, is funded by extortion (taxes), and that most of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "goods" those taxes pay for are things I don't want or even abhor.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3085qlink3">Understood.  What I really want to avoid is the sort of stereotyping</a> of "the
<a name="3085qlink4">other guys" that makes people like Timmy McViegh feel justified in killing
government employees.</a>  I'm not the tax man or a DEA agent.  I build computer
<a name="3085qlink5">systems for an agency that produces information used primarily by
businesses.  I understand that you're not happy with way the funds for my
paycheck are coerced from you, and I'm unhappy that you're unhappy.</a>

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink5">&gt;&gt;&gt;If most gov't activities have nothing to do with force, why can't I</a><br>
<i>&gt;simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;decline to hand over my property to the IRS without risking jail or</i><br>
<i>&gt;worse?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Because that's the law.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, and the law is obviously backed by force, or it wouldn't be law. So</i><br>
<i>&gt;how can you honestly claim that "most gov't activities have nothing to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with force"? They are _all_ supported by monies taken under threat of</i><br>
<i>&gt;force.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, I agree that if you really don't want the government to have it, it is
taken under threat of force.  However, since I don't mind paying taxes, my
money is provided voluntarily.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink6">&gt;&gt;If you can provide a convincing argument that the IRS is unnecessary I</a><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;eliminating the IRS one bit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I shouldn't have to prove that the IRS is "unnecessary", it's for those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;support it to prove that extortion is ethical in support of their goals.</i><br>

<p>
As I see it, the government currently serves a number of useful functions,
and the IRS is required under the current system.<a name="3085qlink6">  I'll go along with
eliminating the IRS as long as I can be assured that I'll still</a> be safe from
<a name="3085qlink7">foreign enemies, still be able to travel rapidly from place to place, etc.</a>
I'm very interested in many of the alternatives proffered in this forum.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink7">&gt;&gt;All of the government employees I know work for agencies involved in</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;commerce, transportation safety and labor issues.  Force has nothing to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, they're all funded by taxes. And they all will resort to police</i><br>
<i>&gt;action where necessary to inflict their decisions on the rest of us. You</i><br>
<i>&gt;know this. Force has _everything_ to do with it.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, I see your point.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink8">&gt;&gt;For the most part I find the bundle of goods and services provided by the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;government to be acceptable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fine. You pay for the bundle, then. Why should I have to pay just because</i><br>
<i>&gt;*you* find it acceptable?</i><br>

<p>
Ideally you shouldn't have to.  However, I'd like to see alternative systems
beta tested before they are universally implemented.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink9">&gt;&gt;If a mugger offered something comparable in</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;compensation for the mugging I probably wouldn't object as strongly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh, come on...</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3085qlink8">OK the mugger case is a bit extreme.  But I'm not simply robbed by the
government, I get stuff from them.  I have no doubt that a lot</a> of this stuff
<a name="3085qlink9">could be provided cheaper by private concerns, but the status quo</a> seems good
<a name="3085qlink10">enough to me such that I don't feel pressured to commit myself to
transforming the system.</a>

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink10">&gt;I won't quibble over "constitutionality". But "government" violates my</a><br>
<i>&gt;rights every day. My salary is looted daily (withholding and Social</i><br>
<i>&gt;Insecurity tax), if nothing else. And if I were adamant in my refusal to</i><br>
<i>&gt;"pay" taxes, at some point the IRS (or some goons in uniform) would "blow</i><br>
<i>&gt;me away", as it has done to others in the past.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3085qlink11">I don't think they'd shoot you unless you were pulling a gun on them or
</a>somesuch.<a name="3085qlink12">  I understand that you feel violated, and hope that we can find a
way to rectify this.</a>

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink11">&gt;&gt;As I often say, in the end people *always* have a choice.  You don't have</a><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;do anything you don't want to, even if it's the guvmint doing the asking.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;There are consequences, of course.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You know, you have a point. I don't _have_ to hand my wallet to the mugger</i><br>
<i>&gt;who "asks" for it. There are consequences, of course.</i><br>

<p>
Exactly.  I don't mean this lightly, either.<a name="3085qlink13">  To me it is a great comfort to
know that no one, not a mugger and not the government, can make me do
anything I don't want to do.  Well, maybe under extreme torture, but</a> you get
the point.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink12">&gt;&gt;There most certainly is such a thing as normative economics.  You can find</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;this terminology in any good intro economics text.  Objective descriptions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of economic behavior are quite a different thing than proposals for</i><br>
<i>&gt;economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;policy.  Economists engage in both activities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Normative economics" is a synonym for what used to be known as "political</i><br>
<i>&gt;economy", as distinct from economics per se. When economists engage in</i><br>
<i>&gt;policy prescription, they are acting in their capacity as political</i><br>
<i>&gt;advisors, not as economists strictly speaking. Politics and economics are</i><br>
<i>&gt;separate fields of inquiry, albeit often intermixed in practice.</i><br>

<p>
Where I went to school it was still called political economy by the polysci
department.  Most of my econ classes were strictly positive but I there were
a few policy classes that bordered on normative.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink13">&gt;&gt;*My* objective is to live in a largely libertarian society under a</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;minimalist government.  Don't go jumping to conclusions about my motives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pardon me if that's so. Are you actively engaged in reducing the size and</i><br>
<i>&gt;scope of "government"? Is that why you hold the job you do?</i><br>

<p>
I hold the job I do because it pays the bills.  As I said, I myself am not
so outraged about the government as to quit my job on principle.  While I'm
not actively engaged in reducing the size and scope of government, I support
others' efforts to do so. 

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink14">&gt;&gt;"I" want to take it from "you"?  I don't want to take anything from you.</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Why do you think this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3085qlink14">I'd be more than happy to refund the money you paid for me.  I don't want

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink15">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sure, governments do bad things, but so do businesses.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

It's a little matter of scale, you see.</a>

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink16">&gt;&gt;&gt;Business can't get away with bad things by dint of firepower or</a><br>
<i>&gt;"sovereign</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;immunity", however.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;True.  Mostly they have to rely on PR people to cover their</i><br>
<i>&gt;transgressions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yeah, that's certainly the "moral equivalent" of armed force, isn't it?</i><br>

<p>
I hold this sort of moral calculus to be purely subjective, so I really
can't say for sure.

<p>
<a href="3063.html#3078qlink17">&gt;&gt;Why should my feelings upset you so as to cause gastric distress?</a><br>
