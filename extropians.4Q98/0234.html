<p>
I'm not a minister. I'm a psychologist. I have heard us referred 
to, however, as secular priests.  I actually like that term. 
I don't know what to tell you about "why that is".  It's Dallas. . . 
</a>
it's conservative.  I once made a reference to the Men's  
movement . . . and the 5 women in the room there gave me 
the kind of look you might see a a dog make after moving his 
food dish.  "Why would MEN need a movement?" one of 
them said.  "Because men are also victims of social 
conditioning and stereotypes." I said.  But their heads 
remained cocked with that confused expression on their
faces.  All they understood was that men seemed to have 
more money and more power and the idea that this might 
not be a healthy situation never crossed their mind.
For me to go even further and announce that their
god is a famtasy would have been to commit political suicide.  
Since I don't care what they think, why should I do something 
like that?

Could be.
