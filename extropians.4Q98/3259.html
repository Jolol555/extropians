<a name="3263qlink1">I agree 100%.  However, *information* itself is a form of force.  For 
example, ubiquitous broadband is a form of force.  I'm *FOR* widely 
available broadband.  However, if we deploy supercomputing hypercube

proxies in the free world, we need to eliminate the unfree world,

<p>
Let's assume that Harry Truman (<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/history.htm">http://www.sandia.gov/history.htm</a>)got 
together with Howard Hughes and created a black box money-no-object 
all necessary means whatever it takes special project to make sure 
that all freedom loving people could be set free by the year 2000.

<p>
One of the means available as an option would be Hydrogen bombs and 
laser-to-nucleus accumbens light shows.

<p>
This may sound cruel, but historically speaking, we all die sooner or 
later.  I personally would prefer *not* to die.  However, a totally 
open system can't be created unless the memeset carriers opposed to 
freedom are disabled.  This might not mean killing everyone who 
disagrees with freedom: but it might mean giving the enemies of 
freedom neurotomies to disable their attitude control nuerons that 
are involved in opposing freedom.

<pre>
For example, North Korea.  Closed society.  DEFINITELY NOT OPEN 
SOURCE.  So, they have a choice, open their system, or be 
deactivated, top down, until the society opens.  We can start with 
</pre>
lasers, and go from the top of the social pyramid down, or we can use 
hydrogen bombs to deactivate the whole populace at once.

<p>
Obviously, death and violence are not desirable, and freedom, 
kindless, gentleness, and tolerance are preferable.  But, we can't 
all wait around forever while closed societies remain rigid and 
dogmatic in their defiance of openness and liberty.

<p>
There's something called revisionist history.  In other words, it's 
quite likely that enemies of freedom could be culled from the herd 
without the public at large even being made aware of it.

<p>
<a name="3264qlink1">Personally, I firmly believe that we will all be free by 2000.
</a>

<p>
If you have friends in North Korea or Bahdad, I would advise you to 
advise them to move to the country (as far as possible from densely 
populated areas).  Personally, I would hate to see anyone who favors 
freedom to be in harms way.
