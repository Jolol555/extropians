A Pickup is a very utilitarian vehicle, however there is one problem with those that are rear wheel
drive, because most of the weight is in the front than normal vehicles, even rear wheel drive cars,
you are more likely to lose traction under adverse conditions. If you get a hydraulic dump on it,
that would add decent weight to it. Definitely get tire chains. When I had a pickup they were worth
their weight in gold.

<p>
Yes, better that someone else gets it than you.
