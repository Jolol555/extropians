There are several options and alternatives for travelling to the stars.

<p>
One possibility is to have a galactic civilization, but to have most
people just stay home.  There could be active (but slow) communication
between the stars, so that if you wanted to experience some natural
wonder elsewhere in the galaxy, you could download the data and visit
a perfect simulation of it.

<p>
If you want to travel, you could do it as electromagnetic waves.  Have
yourself beamed to another star and reconstructed there.

<p>
If you must go physically, you could bring along friends, associates,
favorite sims, or whatever else you use to pass the time.  Or you could
always just shut yourself down for the trip.
