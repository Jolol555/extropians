<p>
  IAN: Do you have any evidence to support this "very 
  strong statistic" that would show that the purported
  highest-rate of throat cancer is linked to vagabonds?</a>

<p>
  If "transients" refers to tourists, then I would observe
  that if you were on a vacation, chances are good, if you
  started to get the early signs of throat cancer, you'd 
  wait until you were home to have it checked out, and 
  if you had it checked during your vacation, you'd
  most assuredly return home to have it treated.
  So the case for tourists depositing the highestrate
   of throat cancer in Amsterdam seems tortured.
