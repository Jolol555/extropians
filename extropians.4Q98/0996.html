<a href="0993.html#0996qlink1">&gt; Since I believe in maximizing freedom of the individual, I</a><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't want to force trading between the past and the future on</i><br>
<i>&gt;others. I'm hopeful than self-replicating systems and the like</i><br>
<i>&gt;will enable total individualists to go their own way, and various</i><br>
<i>&gt;forms of collective association association to flourish. For me,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the negative in Socialism is the coercion of those who don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;desire to redistribute any of their wealth, not the desire to take</i><br>

<p>
Good point! Collective association's (like trade unions) can be
beneficial, and often absolutely necessary when dealing with an
organization that is both capitalist, and feudalist (almost any
modern corporation).

<p>
In recent negotiations, we started by opening up our thinkpads
pulling up the spreadsheets and saying " I thought we'd start by
talking about the recent 2 billion dollar stock bye-back, the 6%
increase in shareholder dividends, and management compensation for
the last three years."

<p>
We settled for a modest 4.1% increase per anum and a three year
contract.    ;)
