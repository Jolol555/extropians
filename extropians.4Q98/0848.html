<a name="0851qlink1">One flaw in the spherical semiconductors.  Certian devices are made on the
&lt;100&gt; surface of Si, and others on the &lt;111&gt; surface.  When oxidized, the 111
surface has higher surface charged defect density, making it less suitable for
good MOS circuits.  

<p>
By definition shpere must have multiple crystal orientations on it's surface.
A real fundamental practical problem.  I like Dan's stuff on the cheap, slabs-
</a>
stic chip approach.  We need a good science fiction story to explore the
implications of this ! 

<p>
There is  (or was) the multichip module approach (MCM).  Bare (no plastic or
ceramic chip package) die are bonded to a very high density interconnect. The
MCM was made with the same technology as chips a few generations back with
thick copper lines  of the 10-20 micrometer width range.   The market did not
really take off and only a few companies are left in it. Micro Module Systems,
a spin off from DEC is still credible.
