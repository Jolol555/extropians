Hi all,

<p>
Damien said regarding tax
<br>
<a href="1054.html#1060qlink1">&gt;my tribe notionally chips in for the things we especially fancy, as well</a><br>
<i>&gt;as shouldering our share of the costs of the commonweal (roads, air traffic</i><br>
<i>&gt;control, etc).</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1107qlink1"> As you go on to note, libertarian's just don't grok tax</a> in the first 
place.If all we are doing is chipping in for our fancy: why not just let 
us chip in all by our selves? 

<p>
Anyhow. Regarding state funding for bigotry training and mind-ablation.  
It has previously been found necessary to keep the religious people out 
of government by law. In absentia such laws, God lovers royally screw any 
nation they get their hands on. We ahve some quite nice case studies: 
pre- vs post- Elizabethan England, caused unmitigated disaster across 
Europe and continue to f__k up every country they are allowed to have a 
hand in governing. 

<p>
Religion in state funded schools should be illegal. Jefferson said it, 
and he was right.

<p>
The compromise is that we don't teach atheism in school (though science 
makes it pretty clear (to anyone lacking the neural god-module) that 
god-stuff is nonsense.


<p>
cheers,
