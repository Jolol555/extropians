Mature nanotech may make socialism a dead issue, but it doesn't solve the
problem of government in general.  Two parties with similar levels of
nanotech can still commit violence against each other, so the same arguments
about law enforcement and defense apply.

<p>
Of course, the debate is complicated by the fact that the people using the
technology are likely to be Transhuman.  Mature nanotech is far to complex
to be designed by unenhanced minds - you first need radical intelligence
enhancement, AI, or a huge breakthrough in automated engineering.  Maybe
people with IQ 300+ will finally be able to settle these issues.
