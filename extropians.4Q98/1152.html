I was pretty disappointed in the segment on cryonics. 
It was particularly offensive that the *one* individual they 
interviewed who pooh-poohed cryonics was the *one* 
whose credentials they emphasized (professor as U of C), 
implying that "professionals" or "experts" in the field 
consider it nonsense.  I tried to imagine myself as a viewer
hearing about cryonics for the first time, and I think I would
have concluded that these cryonicists seem like nice enough 
people and they don't seem to be harming anyone, but they're
dreaming!  And I couldn't believe I heard the infamous 
hamburger quote again!

<p>
Oh well.  I wasn't expecting much better.
