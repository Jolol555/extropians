Somewhere there must be an agency or collection of agencies that 
has a "master plan", complete with transition logistics to an 
automated economy.  This would include all systems: economic 
system, legal system, education system, transportation system, 
health care system, waste management system, communication 
system, etc.

<p>
It seems that whoever has constructed this master plan is use mindcontrol
 systems to disclose these plans as revelations during e-mail 
conversations.

<p>
My guess is that there will be a switch over to a "global gameboard" 
style economy and automated shuttle transportation system.  There 
will be some sort of global inventory, where each item is tracked and 
associated with a "custodian", rather than an owner.  This means, in 
essence, that real property and goods will be free.  There will 
probably be laws against "hoarding".

<p>
The transportation system will probably consist of robotic shuttles, 
that aren't necessary "parked" 90% of the time, like today's 
automobiles.  (pardon the guestimated statistics, accurate numbers 
can be provided by researchers who have access to the actual 
statistics).

<p>
With MEMS accelerometers, micromagnetometers, and DGPS, 
could we make tiny "sticky thingamawidgets" that are affixed to 
inventory items, giving accurate LPS/GPS telemetry.

<p>
I'm reminded of a 1980's AT&amp;T commercial that showed a woman 
with a shopping cart full of groceries, simply moving through a 
scanner, and having the contents of the cart scanned at once.
