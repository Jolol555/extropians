<a name="0220qlink1">Remote mind control by radio-controlled brain implants 
had been mastered as far back as 1964, to the point that 
scientists "played" animals "like little electronic toys,"
according to the following New York Times article:</a>

<p>
   'Matador' With a Radio Stops Wired Bull: Modified 
    Behavor in Animals Subject of Brain Study. 

<p>
    By John A. Osmundsen 

<p>
    Afternoon sunlight poured over the high wooden 
    barriers into the ring, as the brave bull bore 
    down on the unarmed "matador" -- a scientist 
    who had never faced fighting bull. 

<p>
    But the charging animal's horns never reached 
    the man behind the heavy red cape. Moments before
     that could happen, Dr. Jose Delgado, the scientist,
     pressed a button on a small radio transmitter
     in his hand and the bull braked to a halt. 

<p>
    Then he pressed another button on the transmitter,
     and the bull obediently turned to the right 
    and trotted away. 

<p>
    The bull was obeying commands in his brain that 
    were being called forth by electrical stimulation 

<UL>
  <li>  by the radio signals -- of certain regions in 
    which fine wires had been painlessly planted." 


</UL>
<p>
    The experiment, conducted last year in Cordova, 
    Spain, by Dr. Delgado of Yale University's School 
    of Medicine, was probably the most spectacular 
    demonstration ever performed of the deliberate 
    modification of animal behavior through external 
    control of the brain. . . . 

<p>
    He has been working in this field for more than 
    15 years. Techniques that he and other scientists 
    have recently developed have been refined to the 
    point where, he believes, "a turning point has 
    been reached in the study of the mind." 

<p>
    "I do believe," he said in a recent lecture, 
    "that an understanding of the biological bases 
    of social and antisocial behavior and of mental 
    activities, which for the first time in history 
    can now be explored in a conscious brain, may be 
    of decisive importance in the search for intelligent
     solutions to some of our present anxieties, 
    frustrations and conflicts."

<p>
    Based on His Experiment

<p>
    Dr. Delgado's contention that brain research 
    has reached a stage of refinement where it can 
    contribute to the solution of some...problems 
    is based he said, on many of his own experiments. 

<p>
    These have shown, he explained, that "functions 
    traditionally related to the psyche, such as 
    friendliness, pleasure or verbal expression, 
    can be induced, modified and inhibited by 
    direct electrical stimulation to the brain."

<p>
    For example, he has been able to "play" monkeys 
    and cats "like little electronic toys" that yawn, 
    hide, fight, play, mate and go to sleep on command.


<p>
    . . .

<p>
    Some of The Results Listed

<p>
    With such techniques, Dr. Delgado has shown: 


<UL>
  <li>  Monkeys will learn to press a button that 
    sends a stimulus to the brain of an enraged 
    member of the colony and calms it down, indicating
     that animals can be taught to control
     other's behavior. 

  <li>  A monkey, stimulated to extremely aggressive
     behavior will make "intelligent" attacks 
    only on competitive members of the colony, 
    sparing other, friendlier, ones.

  <li>  Monkeys and cats can be triggered into sequential
     behavior in which one might open its 
    mouth, turn around, walk to a corner, climb a 
    wall, jump down and return to "start," repeating
     those movement in the  same  order  every 
    time they are stimulated but will modify the 
    pattern if other animals get in the way or if 
    they are threatened. 


</UL>
<p>
    The latter two experiments show that electrical
     brain stimulation does not simply evoke 
    automatic responses but reactions that become 
    integrated into the social behavior according 
    to the individual's own personality or temperament,
     Dr. Delgado said. 

<p>
    Experiments have been conducted on human beings 
    by Dr. Delgado and other scientists, primarily 
    during the treatment of certain types of epilepsy.
     Stimulation of particular areas of the 
    brain have produced anxiety, profound feelings 
    of friendliness and, in one case, a six-fold 
    increase in word output.

<p>
    The Yale neurophysiologist believes that techniques
     such as the one he is using can lead to 
    the discovery of the cerebral basis of anxiety, 
    pleasure, aggression and other mental functions 
    and that "we shall be in a much better position 
    to influence their development and manifestation 
    (in various ways) especially by means of more 
    scientifically programmed education."
