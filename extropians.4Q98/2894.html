        Yes; check the archives from about four months ago.</a>

        It is probably impossible to pinpoint any one kind of music as
extropian.  Music, like any art, is objective only to the ones who peruse
it. My tastes may differ from those of most other people (and they do) yet
since I am an extropic individual, does that make my tastes extropic?
Doubtful.  A lot of the owness falls upon the musicians themselves; for
example (and mind the possible bias) the Mike Oldfield album _The Songs Of
Distant Earth_ could be considered extropic due to the fact that it mirrors
Arthur C. Clarke's excellent book of the same name --indicative of
Oldfield's intentions.  However, many extropians may not care for the music.</a>

<a name="2937qlink3">        On a similar note, my own music compositions may not convey a lot
about my optimism towards future progress or desire for extended mortality,
yet they give me, an extropian, an outlet for different kinds of expression
--pleasing and displeasing to others' ears.  Needless, to say, it depends
upon the musician's objective as well as the listener's discretion to
decide what makes music "extropic" or not.</a>
