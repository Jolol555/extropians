Oh don't be so harsh. You are exactly right about the surveillance state.
Remember though about the list: we have a lot more newbies who still have a lot
of statist, anti-individualist memetic programming in them, even those people
who think that they don't, do.  This is a forum for helping these people
reprogram themselves.
