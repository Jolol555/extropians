<p>
Respectable scientists don't read nanotech advocates. Maybe this will
change when the latter start be published in refereed journals. 
Electronic resources, especially Usenet posts are simply not visible 
to scientific mainstream. This is silly, but you must consider that
handicap when you expect to see valid criticisms by the establishment.

Crit is so _slow_, especially overseas. Are there any plans to make
the database distributed? Is Foresight running the service on their 
own resources, or did they receive any hardware/bandwidth donations?

<p>
I must say I made basically the opposite observation. There is much imo
unfounded belief in rational design (as if one could clone/upgrade 
artifexes faster than grow computational darwin-in-machina circuitry) and 
containability of nanoevolution processes (so far archaeology has
failed to find even fossil traces of ur-autoreplicators). The 'active 
shield' mantra is too often invoked. To me, this is simply not
</a>
addressing the issue, but it is exactly these fuzzy anything-goes 
claims, criticisms and countercriticisms that point at the heart of the
<a name="1547qlink4">malaise. Nanotechnology as practiced on the web is simply not a
science. And nanotechnology, as practiced in the laboratory is simply 
</a>
not exciting enough. Too bad.

<p>
<a href="1262.html#1272qlink5"> &gt; Drexler simply says he can't imagine how 20 years from now there could</a><br>

<i> &gt; people who suspect he's a theoretician who doesn't know much about the</i><br>
<i> &gt; mundane details needed to translate theory into practice.</i><br>

<p>
'Mundane details needed to translate theory into practice' says it
fairly all. Drexlerian nanotechnology means: I can build a device which
can more or less sustainably clone itself within a time span of less 
than an hour by means of mechanosynthetic reactions -- as simple as that.

<p>
<a name="1547qlink7">Is such a device possible? No one can say, now. If there was a
detailed, mundane blueprint, we could simulate and validate that. 
But there is none. How does one supposed to prove the existance and
met functionality of a mundane device which is not specified? The
</a>
<a name="1547qlink8">science/technology validation process does not work that way. It would
help a lot if there was a mundane, well-developed body of theory describing
mechanosynthetical processes. But there is none! (Don't say things
like Schroedinger or ab initio, that doesn't count). So we have to resort
</a>
to a massive make-believe that we can build the repertoire of required
mundane structures (the set of which, also, happens to be undefined) 
by this unspecified, mundane set of mechanosynthetic reactions. 

<p>
Is this science? Is this technology? Whatever it is, it not
<a name="1547qlink9">validable. Which does not mean that it is impossible -- simply 
we. just. can't. tell. yet.

nanolithography into full-blown all-purpose mechanosynthesis is
scheduled to be the next Nobel laureate -- and Generic Saviour as well.
