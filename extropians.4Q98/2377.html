<a name="2382qlink1">I'm working on a more comprehensive rebuttal, but first, I want to say
that the entire premise of socialism is based on violence directed at
the individual.  When a government steals money earned by a worker, it
is practicing a form of violence.</a>

<p>
Remember, if a worker resists the government's demand for his money,
he will be met with violence.

<p>
Do you refute this?  If so, please explain how taxation is nonviolent.
 If you don't refute this, please explain how government mandated
violence against individuals fits in with Extropian principles.

<i>&gt; -----Original Message-----</i><br>
<i>&gt; From: Terry Donaghe &lt;tdonaghe@yahoo.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Amen!  I would love to see a rational defense of socialism by some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;our collectivist associates.  I posit that it can't be done</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(rationally).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Any takers?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any defense of socialism I would mount would have to take into</i><br>
account three
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink2">&gt; basic assumptions:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Human nature is such that all people try to benifit themselves</i><br>
(and to a
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink3">&gt; lesser extent their friends/relatives) as much as possible.</a><br>
<i>&gt; 2) 'Property' does not actually exist and is merely a way of saying</i><br>
'I deny
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink4">&gt; you access to this'.</a><br>
<i>&gt; 3) Sufficient social/monetary inequality leads to social disruption.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Communists tend to forget point (1) and focus on point (2).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Capitalists tend to forget point (2) and focus on point (1)</i><br>
<i>&gt; (3) tends to cause problems in capitalist societies on an internal</i><br>
basis (in
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink5">&gt; the UK, under more capitalist policies the percentage difference</a><br>
between the
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink6">&gt; rich and the poor went up by about 7% over the 10 years the</a><br>
conservative
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink7">&gt; party was in power.  This caused large amounts of social unrest,</a><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrations and the biggest landslide in living history for their</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposition party).</i><br>
<i>&gt; (3) tends to cause problems for communist societies on an external</i><br>
basis
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink8">&gt; (When the Soviet Republics realised how much better of Western</a><br>
Europe was
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink9">&gt; they revolted.)</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A fourth point is sometimes useful to remember.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (4) Homo Sapiens is a pack animal that naturally speaking has a</i><br>
heirarchy.
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink10">&gt; People are most comfortable with a chain of command.  They like to</a><br>
feel that
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink11">&gt; the chain of command listens to them and considers their feelings</a><br>
and that
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink12">&gt; it is looking out for them.  It is a mistake to indulge this too</a><br>
much, but
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink13">&gt; it is worth bearing in mind.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Having shown that both Communist and Capitalist societies tend to</i><br>
forget
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink14">&gt; about one of (1) or (2) thus causing (3), I would say that it makes</a><br>
sense to
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink15">&gt; mix them sluightly, taking into account of both (1) and (2) which</a><br>
gives...
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink16">&gt; socialism.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My preferred method of socialism would be to provide free Gealth</i><br>
Care (of a
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink17">&gt; standard necessary to get people back to work) and enough of a</a><br>
handout to
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink18">&gt; allow people to survive.  This handout should _not_ be means tested</a><br>
(if it
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink19">&gt; drops as they start earning here is less incentive to start</a><br>
earning).  Free
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink20">&gt; Education will also be provided (education leads to raised output</a><br>
and higher
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink21">&gt; GNP's as well as lowering reproduction), but not in the current form</a><br>
- as
<br>
<a href="2372.html#2377qlink22">&gt; has been pointed out most current education sucks.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I look forward to hearing objections.</i><br>
