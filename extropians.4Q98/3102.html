You might want to read some Ayn Rand. Don't you have things that you want to
do? Don't you like to do certain things? Under Socialism, you would be able
to do the things you love and provide a service to your friends, family, and
society. That might be kinda anti-individualist, but not if you do it
because you love to do it and not because it makes you look good in front of
others. I'm a generous person and I like to help people and do things and
make things, unfortunately, capitalism in doing this as much as I would
like.<a name="3126qlink1"> I defy Ayn Rand</a> and I state that it is possible to be socialist and
<a name="3164qlink1"><a name="3126qlink2">individualist, it's just a matter of prime motivation.</a></a>
