<i>&gt;&gt;write one down because it's almost a tautology: if you assume</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;[list of assumptions]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3428qlink1"><i>&gt;Did Coase in fact simply assume these things in his paper? What did</a> he win</i><br>
<a name="3428qlink2"><i>&gt;the Nobel prize for, then?</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3428qlink3">Asking the right question, even if the answer is trivial.</a>

<p>
<a href="3410.html#3415qlink2">&gt;&gt;I think the key problem is that most "libertarians" don't like simple</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;consequential analyses of legal &amp; political questions, preferring</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;axiomatic analyses instead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's because we don't believe that the end justifies the means. We prefer</i><br>
<i>&gt;a more principled approach to ethical questions. A consequential analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt;gives the probable outcome of a given policy, but whether that outcome is</i><br>
<i>&gt;considered good or bad often depends on the audience.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3428qlink4">Having the ends justify the means is "principled."  Maybe its not</a> a principle
<a name="3428qlink5">you like, but that's another matter.</a>  I think it's an empirical fact about 
policy debate if one sticks with simple consequences there usually isn't 
much debate about which consequences are good or bad.

<p>
<a href="3410.html#3415qlink3">&gt;We have more than</a><br>
<i>&gt;adequate reason, on nonconsequentialist grounds, to believe that coercion</i><br>
<i>&gt;inevitably makes most people, and eventually everyone, worse off regardless</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the achievement of any particular good favored by the purveyors of</i><br>
<i>&gt;force. Analyses like Coase's serve to buttress this belief by showing how</i><br>
<i>&gt;solutions arise on a free market, but don't - and shouldn't - form the</i><br>
<i>&gt;foundation of (anti)political philosophy.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3428qlink7">But Coase gives a *consequential* analysis in favor of markets!</a>

<p>
<a href="3410.html#3415qlink4">&gt;&gt;Or they may be forced to invoke an [un]usual consequence</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;like "reduces liberty"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So that's not a bad consequence in your book? I predict your judgment would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be different if it were specifically *your* liberty that's being reduced</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of (the hidden assumption) someone else's.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3428qlink8">If my liberty was reduced, that should show itself in lots of simple
familiar consequences.  I wouldn't get to eat the things I like, 
live in the places I like, etc.  I could be displeased by that outcome
even without adding on an extra "and my liberty was reduced."</a> 

<p>
<a name="3428qlink9"><a href="3410.html#3415qlink5">&gt;&gt;I embrace simple consequential analysis as a basis for policy</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;discussions.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3428qlink10"><i>&gt;So did Machiavelli.</a></i><br>

<p>
To his credit.  

<p>
<a name="3428qlink11"><a href="3410.html#3415qlink6">&gt;&gt;I accept these features because simple consequential analysis seems</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;our best chance for creating broad intellectual consensus on policy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;questions.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3428qlink12"><i>&gt;If by an appeal to their material advantage we can persuade the less</i><br>
<i>&gt;principled to support freedom, that's better than nothing, I suppose.</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3428qlink13">There are lots more simple consequences than "material advantage."
There's having friends, enjoying conversations, liking music, 
traveling to interesting places, etc.</a>

<p>
<a href="3410.html#3415qlink7">&gt;&gt;People do form self-serving beliefs about the details of</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;which particular situations lead to which simple consequences.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;evidence slowly erodes these views, and I see much less prospect for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;erosion of disagreements about what axioms to accept or what unusual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;consequences to include in analyses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3428qlink14"><i>&gt;IOW you prefer the _status quo_ of opportunistic power struggles to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;principled discussion of the ethical foundations of a good society.</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3428qlink15">Again, power struggles *are* "principled."  And there is no real
alternative to participating in them -- "ethical" discussions are just
one of many ways to play the power struggle game.</a>
