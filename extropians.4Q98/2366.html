  Extropians are among the most intelligent people I know and  I want to 
see us all make the most of our knowledge and abilities to better 
ourselves by improving communications and collaborating on projects 
which bring us closer to our shared goals.
I am most interested in doing PRACTICAL research and development work 
towards immortaliism and transhumanism through tissue engineering and 
cybernetics.
<br>
Theoretical topics are exciting, but I really enjoy information that can 
be put to good use, that's why I focused my attention on cutting edge 
diet and exercise regimens for this past year, ALL year.
My specialties are general, practical, and low cost alternative 
therapies for intelligence augmentation, and  life-extension, such as: 
Calorie Restriction <a href="http://www.infinitefaculty.org/sci/cr/cr.htm">http://www.infinitefaculty.org/sci/cr/cr.htm</a> , the 
Anabolic Burst Cycle of Diet and Exercise system by Torbjorn Akerfeldt 
at <a href="http://www.musclemedia.com/training/abcde/v58_abc1.html">http://www.musclemedia.com/training/abcde/v58_abc1.html</a> , the 
Evolutionary Fitness system by Art DeVany at 
<a href="http://www.democ.uci.edu/econ/personnel/devany/EvolutionaryFitness.html">http://www.democ.uci.edu/econ/personnel/devany/EvolutionaryFitness.html</a> 
, Eat Smart, Think Smart by Robert Haas, and the Eat Right 4 Your 
(Blood) Type system by Peter J. D'Adamo at <a href="http://www.dadamo.com">http://www.dadamo.com</a>.
That's why I haven't been participating on the list much.
I learned that most people should fire their blood-sucking doctors, not 
that I have anything against vampires; vamps are cool, but most doctors 
suck, except when it comes to critical care.
I know the power of a focused mind.
<br>
That's why I want to be part of a focused group.
So what do you say?
<br>
Let's get down and dirty.
