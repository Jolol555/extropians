ice is good for kids, bad for the rest of us.  several years ago i
worked at china lake and they had a rare cold snap one day when
the temp was about 14 f (-10 c).  to get on the base you had to
show your badge at the guard gate.  the guard had seen me riding
a motorcycle on a number of occasions when the weather was
nicer.  went out that morning, truck wouldnt start.  i needed to
get to work , so just for laughs i decided to try starting my old bike.
fired up second kick.  i put on every stitch of clothing i owned
and off i went.

<p>
when i got to the guard gate, i managed to stop the bike but i was
in a hypothermic torpor and my hands were too frozen to get my
badge out of my pocket.  i struggled to find the badge and the guard said
"i *KNOW* who you are, you silly ass.  who else would ride a
motorcycle on a day like this?  get in here before you freeze to death."
