Yes, and that is still an average. If you narrow down by passive features
like your demographics, geographics, and existing personal habits, you can
get the odds to near astronomical levels. Just not having a criminal record
reduces your chances at least four fold, if not more. Not living within x
miles of an urban center is another good move, as is having a decent income.
Neophility does have an evolutionary disadvantage here, a neophilic is more
likely to get into dangerous situations than someone more habitual and
conservative. The only times I have been a crime victim was when I was in a
big city (San Fransisco, Seattle, Burlington).
