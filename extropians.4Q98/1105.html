i suspect the separatists came to america to prevent information from
*coming into* their society, as much or more than to prevent information about
themselves from leaking out.  each generation would need to carefully block
information channels to the next generation in order to prevent them from
becoming
<br>
like the society the separatists so despised.  i have seen, first hand,
information
<br>
control at work still today, in the form of blocking or distorting information
about science in general and evolution in particular.  {8-[  spike
