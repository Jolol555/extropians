<p>
&gt; I got the info form an article at  <a href="http://www.eet.com">http://www.eet.com</a> sometime last <br>
&gt; week.<br>

<p>
<a href="1342.html#1351qlink1">&gt; One of the most important goals of the G3 specification is to create</a><br>
<i>&gt; a world-wide standard so that you phone will work anywhere.</i><br>

<p>
Thank you.  It will be nice if we extend the definition of "phone" to 
include any communications system (including high fidelity systems):

<pre>
  networked computer              (a.k.a. PC with web connection)
  portable audio receiver         (a.k.a. AM/FM radio)
  portable video receiver         (a.k.a. VHF/UHF battery-powered TV)
  home audio receiver             (a.k.a. home hi-fi stereo)
  home audio transmitter/receiver (a.k.a. speakerphone)
  home video receiver             (a.k.a. television)
  home video transmitter/receiver (a.k.a. videophone)
  mobile phone                    (a.k.a. full dux two-way radio)  

</pre>
<p>
Somehow, I forgot to use the word "office" above.  Maybe those will 
be things of the past if the G3 spec allocates enough bandwidth?

<p>
I wonder if there will be G3 digital equivalents of "scanners"?  My 
guess: no, because the communication channels will be encrypted from 
end to end using MEMS within the intercell transport infrastructure.
