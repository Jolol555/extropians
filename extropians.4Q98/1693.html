<a href="1675.html#1693qlink1">    &gt;Even for actual murder cases, there are often extenuating</a><br>

<i>    &gt;or by people who are incapable of understanding what they are doing.</i><br>

<p>
I read a small story in my local newspaper a few days ago, it seems
that a man was watching a movie in a theater and got up to get some
popcorn, in doing so he accidentally stepped on a strangers foot. The
other man decided that his best course of action would be to pull out a
knife and slice open the poor fellow's jugular vein. Other moviegoers
were showered in his blood and he died before they could even stop the
projector.

<p>
A creature capable of such an act is far more dangerous than somebody
who planed a murder for a year in order to get a million dollars. To my
mind he's more contemptible too, if I get murdered I hope it's over
something more important than stepping on somebody's foot.

<p>
As for life in prison without parole, I don't think it's a viable
alternative to death. In the USA there are 1.7 million people in jail,
if I'm one of them and have already been convicted of murder then I
have no reason not to do what I enjoy doing and kill again. I have
nothing to lose, they won't kill me and they can't imprison me for two
lifetimes.
