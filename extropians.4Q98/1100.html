"Lycopene in Association with Alpha-tocopherol Inhibits at Physiological
Concentrations Proliferation of Prostate Carcinoma Cells"

<p>
Abstract:

<p>
  The effect of lycopene alone or in association with other antioxidents
was studied on the growth of two different human prostate carcinoma cell
lines (the androgen insensitive DU-145 and PC-3). It was found that
lycopene alone was not a potent inhibitor of prostate carcinoma cell
proliferation. However, the simlutaneous addition of lycopene together with
alpha-tocopherol, at physiological concentrations (less than 1 microM and
50 microM, respectively), resulted in a strong inhibitory effect of
prostate carcinoma cell proliferation, which reached values close to 90%.
The effect of lycopene with alpha-tocopherol, was synergistic and was not
shared by beta-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and probucol.
