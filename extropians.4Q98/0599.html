This is not so clear to me.

<p>
Under what circumstances is it legitimate to alter the genome and create
a genetically altered person who is better adapted to some environments
but worse for others?  In space, the legless person, or someone with
hands instead of feet, may have an advantage.  But you can't ask in
advance.

<p>
The question is related to the issue of whether it is right to bring
children into the world in other circumstances where their choices may
be limited.

<p>
Historically, people have had the right to raise their offspring into
virtually any circumstances.  They travel to dangerous new continents and
raise children in hard conditions.  Nobody asks the kids if they mind;
it's impossible to do so until after their born, and then it's too late.

<p>
<a name="0604qlink1">Suppose a ship is being launched to the stars, at relatively slow speeds,
which will take centuries to make the journey.  Even with longevity and
hibernation, it is likely that children will be born, just as have been
born on other migrations.  This is part of the historical pattern of life,
and doesn't seem to raise new ethical problems.

<p>
Bringing kids into such an environment dooms them to life in space
as certainly as biologically adapting them would.  If we accept the
historical precedent for parents to have children in environments which
limit their choices, shouldn't we accept that modifying them is equally
permissible?
