Refering to skecky's item on depenyl for longevity
and web-based health studies

<p>
Use of an HMO database to be the benchmark from which to 
create the blinded cohorts is something I sugested to Dr. Morton
Schulman's asst. for thought when they do a study on deprenyl.

<p>
This could convert a double blind study into a single blind study.
Creating a patient profile for the control subjects and then selecting
the comparables from the entire health sevices receiving population
would be much more ethical since no patients who were known to be
potential candidates would be denied access to treatment with potential
efficacy.

<p>
We here in Saskatchewan Canada have only one HMO the government run 
Medicare system and are implementing a health information network
which would cover all the medical records of the entire population.

<p>
This would be an ideal data management system to use as a platform
from which  to originate "Web based health studies" .

<p>
I'm quite strapped for time to give a proper dissertation but felt I had
to contribute at least this bit.

<p>
PS.....
<br>
We are planning to incorporate a company to produce several
nutraceuticals.  I want to use the name  
EXTROPIAN AGRI-VENTURES .... Any complaints??

<p>
Robin:....

<p>
I wonder if there is an economic benefit to replacing double blind
studies with larger database benchmarked comparative efficacy
studies?
