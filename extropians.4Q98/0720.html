	(Sorry, Alejandro. I was using my fathers header by proxy and
forgot to remove his name from it, so it was not Brian Clancy, rather Steve
Clancy, sorry.)
<p>
	Well, I feel that there is a need for some form of extropian
political representation in Australia. I assume that you are resident in
Australia, so I don't need to remind you of the political spectre of
Pauline Hanson and her rather illogical political party.
<p>
	It has been stated in previous list postings that one way to get
around the laws that inhibit extropian principals and enterprises, like
genetic and body alteration, would be to simple break the law. While this
is an admirable thing to consider, risking one's self for one's beliefs, it
is quite difficult to do genetic study and scientific tasks while locked
behind bars for 20 years to life.
<p>
	This is why we need extropian principles in our political way of
life, if nothing, to counter the somewhat illogical rantings of our present
system.
<p>
	Thanks, Steve C.
