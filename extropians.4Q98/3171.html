I don't think cloning has any special use seperate from the use of
reproduction in general. If you dumped 200 Einsteins into the world, very
few if any of them would grow up in situations similar to those that
Einstein grew up in. I read some article about geniuses once, some study
someone did of their lives.. this was several years ago and I *think* it was
in newsweek. I remember they studied Einstein, Freud, Picasso, Hemingway,
and some other people who were recognized geniuses in their feild. They
found a lot of unusual similarities.. they were all oldest or only children,
they were all a member of some minority religion or ethnicity in their area,
they all did poorly early on in school and were considered very dull, and
they were all born to very young parents. I think these social circumstances
have a lot more to do with genius then genetics (obviously genetics does
*something*, otherwise there should be some chimpanzee geniuses). 
Incidentally, Einstein had 3 children.. one died in a mental hospital with
schizophrenia. Another one was set up for adoption at a very young age and
nobody knows what happened to her.

I remember reading someplace that Thomas Edison's son was a severe social
fuck-up too.
