  IAN: Amazing article! That "the [brain] implant
  becomes naturally 'wired' into the patient's brain 
  as neurones grow into the cones and attach themselves 
  to the electrodes mounted inside," and that "An FM 
  transmitter under the scalp transmits the signal 
  without wires, and...no batteries," to operate
  the cursor on a computer is hard to believe! 

<p>
<a name="0201qlink1">  It's actually bionic "telekinesis." Now if it 
  works this way, it must surely be able to work 
  the other way, that is, signals sent to a brain
  could control that brain from a distant location.
  The central planner's wet dream come true! Armies
  of ideal citizens, jumping to the central commands.</a>
  "I think I love the Great Leader, oh Great Leader,
  to serve your plans brings happiness to my mind,
  but when I question the plan I feel pain, so
  serving the Great Leader's plan is good."
