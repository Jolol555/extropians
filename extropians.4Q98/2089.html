Oddly enough, I think you've hit on one of the few abilities that even
mature nanotechnology can not provide.  Oh, sure, you could keep a complete
sensory record of a normal human's life, but who here plans on remaining a
normal human?  The more you upgrade yourself, the more storage space this
memory record requires, because your upgraded senses are recording more
data.  No matter how advanced your technology becomes, you will always be
able to build sensors that produce more data than you can record. Perhaps a
full-fledged Power could find a way around this limitation, but I don't
think any lesser mind has much chance of it.
