no kidding.  they used to say they were developing lightweight windshield
wipers for submarines, but the secrecy rules have loosened considerably.
a scientific american article from a few years ago demonstrated the cold war
has ended: they showed a photograph of a commie nuclear reentry body.
turns out you can pick off a helllll of a lot of information about the system
from just an external view.  im still surprised they showed it.  in fact, they
had a couple of guys standing there with it, so you could even pick off a length
scale on it, (assuming they didnt use tiny commies.)  theirs was bigger than
i expected.  showed the compound cone angle and everything.  wouldnt
be surprised if some comrades are still in siberia over that.  {8^D

<a name="3505qlink1">the article mentioned pantex and the daunting job they have of taking
nukes out of service in response to the signing of the start 2 agreement
in jan 93.  a am still amazed by that chapter of history: because there
were no guns and swords and uniforms scattered on the ground
(as the song goes), no dancing round and round, but with the stroke of
the pen, over half<a name="3514qlink1"> of the world's nuclear destuction potential was taken
off line.  the newspapers mentioned it in one paragraph on the bottom
of page 19.</a></a>

<p>
glad to hear all is well with you evmick!  {8-]  spike
