Dear all,

<p>
Just one last mail befor I will go to the 
Alcor UK meeting in Eastborne.
<br>
(hope to see some of you there)<br>

<p>
I agree on the fact that you could find
<br>
ways to "pay someone in the future" to 
<br>
wake you.  But I was reffering to "all" of 
it in a more general way.

<p>
I strongly believe that we can have the best of both worlds.
I think one of the main things that makes life worthwhile
is socialising with friends and have just plain fun.
<br>
(why would you wan't to live longer in the first place...)<br>
(I'm not saying you can't have friends or fun in a Total free market,<br>
......but I fear you just too busy watching your back all the time)

<p>
This means IMHO that we have to have some sort 
of "mind-set" that we all agree on:

<p>
" OK...you are free to have a gun (free market rigth !)..."

<p>
but i hope we all agree on the fact that:

<p>
" NO..you can't shoot at him just for fun...."

<p>
I agree; it's a bit extreme, but I think it says what I mean.
Try to give as much tasks as possible to the "free market"
They will most of the time do a better job.
But make sure that we have some "rules" that are
controled by an "independent" (dare I say it :-)  goverment
And control it by ; for example "a truth machine :-)"
or something that comes close .....ALWAYS LIVE VIDEO...
of everything they say and do.
<br>
This way it can still be "honestly" controled by the
votes of the majority........
<br>
(only a very few......anarchists will complain that they <br>
still don't have "absolute freedom" (wich in a way they
will never have....but I will try that one later :-)

<p>
Sorry...got to go now.
<br>
(you can mail me on bstaring@csi.com<br>
<br>
 but somehow this adres can't conect to the
 extropy list ......I'm still trying to find out why ?)

<p>
Greetings,

<p>
Berrie
