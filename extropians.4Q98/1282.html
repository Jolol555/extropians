<i>&gt; Today, if someone goes out and surveys the literature,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and gathers a lot of data, then publishes a book arguing on the basis of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; data that, say, Asians are generally all-around smarter than Caucasians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; those people are called racists.  Rationality is irrelevant to the label.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only way not to be a racist today is to say that race and genetics</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes no difference in behavior or intelligence or strength.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Someone who regards themselves as genetically transhuman has taken the</i><br>
<i>&gt; critical step of acknowledging that genetics makes a difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not saying that the term "racist" is being applied incorrectly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it is correct.  Someone who believes there are or can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant observable behavioral differences correlated with race</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a racist.  And anyone who considered themselves transhuman would</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily believe that.  Once you believe that, it would be inconsistent</i><br>
<i>&gt; not to consider that there might be behavioral differences between other</i><br>
<i>&gt; human races, and once you consider that, you are a racist at heart.</i><br>

<a name="1291qlink1">	I've explained it before.  I'll explain it again.  There is
absolutely no biological basis for the conceptual distinction of race.</a>
<a name="1291qlink2">We're just as likely to be more genetically similar to a person of a
different "race" as we are to a member of the same "race."</a>  Literally a
<a name="1291qlink3">racist is a person who believes in the existence.</a>  That belief tends to
perpetuate these artificial divisions within heterogenous societies.

<p>
	Ethnic groups have definitive existence.  "Race" is a meaningless
destructive aneristic illusion.  Caucasians, for example, live in the
Caucasus Mountains of Southern Russia.  They have a distinct shared
culture and even a unique non-Indoeuropean languistic heritage.

<p>
	It is very easy to be non-racist.  Simply discard the concept of
"race" from your memplexes and attack it with uncompromising critical
rationalism whenever it rears its ugly head.  Is there discrimination of
various subcultures and ethnic groups?  There most definitely is, but it
is based on subculture and ethnic groups.<a name="1291qlink4">  I think Richard Dawkins
provided a strong argument group selection in _The Selfish Gene_ for most
of us to reason that any major distinctions into massive human groups
are probably memetic rather genetic.</a>

<p>
And thus racism is slain not with a government program, but with a
rational argument from a Cajun Extropian.  Laissez les bons temps roulez.
