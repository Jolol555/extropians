cool!  sign me up.  can they grow me a new brain?  funny: we've dreamed
of this for years, and now that its here or will be very soon, it somehow
doesnt seem real.  or its just too cool to be real.

looks to me like we may be on the verge of being able to use stem cells
to repair a damaged or severed spinal cord, which makes possible
full-body transplants, or head transplants, if you prefer.  now, steven
hawking is sitting in a wheelchair over there in england somewhere.
seems like he has nada to lose by attempting a body transplant, his
being no good anyway.  he could donate me his head, i instantly get
waaay smart, then i have my head transplanted onto his body and, and...
um, wait, let me think this over.
