<i>&gt;  I've finally read your posting carefully, Greg, and I do appreciate the</i><br>

<i>&gt;  postings on this thread have been based upon the assumption that this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  particular culture of women in Afghanistan are illiterate and largely</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ignorant of their own rights.  This is, unfortunately, not the case.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt;  significant portion of these woman are highly educated, they are doctors</i><br>
and
<br>
<a href="1279.html#1439qlink3">&gt;  lawyers and professional businesswomen.  They worked hard for many decades</a><br>
<i>&gt;  to improve their status.  Now they find themselves completely imprisoned</i><br>
and
<br>
<a href="1279.html#1439qlink4">&gt;  beaten in the streets when they attempt to carry out the daily business of</a><br>
<i>&gt;  living. The streets are policed by uneducated young thugs who have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;  offered power through a fundamentalist religious regime.  Any men who</i><br>
<i>&gt;  support the women seem too intimidated by the threat of force to speak out</i><br>
<i>&gt;  openly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I have trouble envisioning how a memetic bomb or plant can alter the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  situation.  Who would you aim it at?  The women are already fully educated</i><br>
<i>&gt;  as to the direness of their own plight.  They have, at great risk, spoken</i><br>
to
<br>
<a href="1279.html#1439qlink5">&gt;  western reporters and to social researchers who have carried their story to</a><br>
<i>&gt;  the world.  The young men who police the streets are for the first time</i><br>
<i>&gt;  being given influence in their own society.  What incentive do they have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  take on new ideas that would remove them from a position of high status?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The Taliban leaders have been fighting long and hard to take power in their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  country, and it goes without saying that they would not relinquish it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  voluntarily.  Have I missed something about this idea?</i><br>

Good point, Kathryn.  The targets for memetic warfare really aren't the
<a name="1475qlink1">oppressed people in this situation; the proper target is the oppressors.  As
someone else (?) pointed out, perhaps the best memetic warfare is simply to
show these ignorant kids what life is like in a free society.  For the most
part, they may be so brainwahsed that they will misinterpret most of what they
see, but a begining can and should be made.  Over time, it may well corrode
their conditioning.</a>
