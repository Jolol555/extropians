Pretty funny, Sasha.  (Maybe `Blazing Saddles' beat you to the punch in a
few spots, and `Back to the Future Part II'?)

<p>
The general approach reminded me somehow of a very moving poem I once wrote
and later incorporated into my long-defunct novel `The Dreaming Dragons'.
It's about what some might regard as the ultimate politically correct
lifestyle, although some here might embrace it in part or whole:

<p>
	Herbivores

<pre>
	Herbivores are awful bores,
	Obey the laws and sweep the floors.
	To shirk their duties, tasks and chores
	would not be greeted by applause.
	They never eat with gaping jaws
	Nor treat their friends to horrid roars.
	Their diet keeps them free of yaws
	(they buy their fruit at health-food stores
	and even eat their apple cores)
	while innate decency ensures
	that germs which lurk on other paws
	promoting noxious dermal flaws
	are swiftly booted out of doors.
	When teeing off they wear plus-fours.
	At night their bedrooms ring with snores
	(they *never* patronise the whores).
	Nor do they march to foreign wars
	nor sponsor  any foolish cause.
	They wrap their kiddies up in gauze.
	And when it rains, for them it always pours.

</pre>
