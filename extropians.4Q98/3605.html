<a name="3611qlink1"><i>&gt;From an article in "Der Spiegel" 50/1995 on Lawrence M. Krauss, a</i><br>
physicist,<a name="3611qlink2"> I learned that it is theoretically possible to travel through
</a>
space by artificial spacetime flexure: Space in front of the starship is
getting contracted while space behind the ship is getting expanded. The
problem about it would be that the starship has to "carry" the energy of
a few thousand suns</a> with it.
<br>
<a name="3611qlink3">I would like to know if there are other kinds of artificial spacetime
flexures possible, too.</a> If they are possible: Can human bodies be
<a name="3611qlink4">exposed to artificial spacetime flexures, or are there dangers such as
radiation etc?</a>
<br>
<a name="3611qlink5">If yes: How would a human body have to be protected - or maybe even have
to be transformed?</a>
<br>
<a name="3611qlink6">And would a computer which is able to create spacetime flexures
(probably with the help of an accelerator) automatically be able to
create new (cyber-)spacetimes?</a>
<br>
I'm also extremely interested in uploading, although I'd prefer to look
like I do now. I would like to know if it is possible to create a
nondestructive material which can be formed by a computer (and/or
robots) along the uploaded information of every individual human body. I
would prefer my old body to be destructed during the procedure of
forming my new (but optically not different!) one, not during the
procedure of uploading.
<br>
If these issues were discussed earlier in this mailing list, I beg your
pardon for repeating them. My mother Jutta and I are new subscribers to
the list.
