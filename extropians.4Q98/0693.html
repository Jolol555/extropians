<a name="0696qlink1">Following up on the silicon brain story posted earlier,</a> I came across another
<a name="0698qlink1"><a name="0696qlink2">interesting article in the EEtimes

<p>
<a href="http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG19981026S0015">http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG19981026S0015</a>

<p>
This one is about a Raytheon project to build an artificial</a> soldier topped off with
<a name="0696qlink3">the Cog head from MIT. The neural net system proposed is of a type that is new to
</a>
<a name="0696qlink4">me, in that it assumes that the information passed among neurons comes as a result
</a>
<a name="0696qlink5">of the temporal synchrony among signals. Anybody else come across that theory?
</a>

<p>
<a name="0696qlink6"> Building an autonomous, heavily armed soldier strikes me as a risky way to try out
</a>
<a name="0696qlink7">AI theory. A fixed place ABM system is one thing, but a general purpose killer
</a>
<a name="0696qlink8">robot seems like asking for trouble. If programming "do not harm humans" has some
</a>
<a name="0696qlink9">challenges, "kill all humans except for the friendly ones" seems fraught with
</a>
<a name="0696qlink10">peril. Reminds me of an old SF tale, I think called "I made you", in which a dying
</a>
<a name="0696qlink11">engineer is pinned down by the robot sentinel he built.

<p>
 I'd vote for keeping these guys immobile unless you are *really* sure of your IFF
</a>
programming.
