I think it would depend on how much baggage one has to lug around. If
we assume an advanced posthumanist civilization, where all available
matterenergy is turned into computational substrate (unless you have
this ultimative in anal-retentiveness dispelled by a writhing wriggle
of hosts and parasites of all scales doing their evolution dance 
also in physical space -- meshes and hiearchies of fleas ad
infinitum), you are obviously bound for a virtual ecology with 
enormous scope of complexity as artefacted by coevolution. You 
of course have to represent skills evolved in the past which you 
might need in the future. However, there is a tradeoff. The resources 
needed for representation (and be it molecular tape in realspace) 
cannot be timeshared for computation, and hence for evolving adequate 
solutions from scratch. If the baggage becomes too large, you are 
outperformed by individua who had weighted their resource allocation 
differently. Of course a tabula rasa person constantly reinventing 
itself is also an equal absurdity as the walking Library of Babel 
locked in the loop of constant retrieval.

<p>
Assuming that all known systems, whether natural or men-made (I know
this is an arbitrary classification) are hierarchical, why should 
virtual ecologies of giant computing clusters be different? Maybe 
I'm stupid, but I don't see any plausible trajectory how one could 
arrive at an even a flat-hierarchy JB starting with where we are now. 
(Of course talking about post-Singularity events is meaningless, but 
it's so fun...)

<p>
Another reason would seem that signalling costs to obtain some distant
copy might be prohibitive, necessity to integrate an off-shelf module
into a distinct persona (mutation) set aside. Remember Kauffman's
lettuce which we break down do common building blocks instead of
cosmically fusing with it.
