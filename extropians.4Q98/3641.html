        The major eye-opener for me was Ayn Rand's _Anthem_; not only did I
learn from it that ego was not a bad thing, it gave me a glimpse into the
darker side of human nature.  After this, _Atlas Shrugged_ changed my life
irrevocably.  Both books I read for the first time when I was sixteen.

        Also influential are _Ender's Game_ and _The Diamond Age_.  Both
books have a focus on youth, and cover a variety of issues.  _The Diamond
Age_ has more extropic content than _Ender's Game_, but both books do a
great job of conveying the necessity of relying upon oneself in every
situation.
