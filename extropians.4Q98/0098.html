<a href="0086.html#0098qlink1">&gt;&gt;Considering that transients might end up dying of throat cancer in</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Amsterdam then the fact that they bring their ailments with them creates</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a very strong statistic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a name="0101qlink1"><i>&gt;  IAN: Do you have any evidence to support this "very</i><br>
<i>&gt;  strong statistic" that would show that the purported</i><br>
<i>&gt;  highest-rate of throat cancer is linked to vagabonds?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
None other than the common sense fact that this statistic was only cited as
a 'might be the case', a 'for instance' to support the company's prospectus
of this thread's original 'brainwashing', 'propaganda' proposition; - a
point of view for which I'm sure there are many other examples that one
could throw into the pot of probabilities. Aside from the 1/3 probability
that a drug research $100m startup would write the scam into their
prospectus that Amsterdam's elephant's graveyard actually requested the drug
trial on humanitarian grounds then I have no reason to doubt what I read.
Actual hard copy of the prospectus would have to be dug up by a local in
</a>
Vancouver. I could identify the name but can't recall it.
