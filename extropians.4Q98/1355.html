<p>
Today, in the news was reference to humanism and a current change in
direction for a segment of humanists who favor bringing religion into the
philosophy of humanism.

<p>
These changes are stemming from what is referred to as a "younger
generation" who have adopted an affiliation with religion and who are now
moving away from atheism, skepticism, etc.  This about-face turn is
directed toward what is known as "religious humanism."  This fraction of
humanists recognize God as the creator and follow biblical teachings.

<p>
Those now affiliated with religious humanism are breakaways of orthodox
Catholics, Episcopalians, Anglicans and Unitarians, as well as those who
have had no former religious commitment.  Apparently, the Pope recognizes
religious humanism, with a few qualifiers.  Pope sees problems with science
and/or philosophy when these domains of study are used to seek an
<br>
"ultimate" truth.<br>

<p>
"All humanists believe in the dignity of human begins," says William<br>
Franklin, dean of the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale University.  "The
difference is religious humanists believe that dignity comes from having a
relationship with God."

<p>
<a name="1645qlink1">This type of watering down of belief systems has pros and cons.  While</a> I
<a name="1645qlink2">rather like the idea of those who had had devote religious belief</a> systems
<a name="1645qlink3">branching out toward humanism to incorporate a bit of skepticism</a> in their
<a name="1645qlink4">thinking, I wonder if this particular group of humanists is using</a> the word
<a name="1645qlink5">humanism inappropriately and in a way that is damaging</a> to the historical
significance of humanism.

<p>
<a name="1645qlink6">I also wonder if this media-attention-getting-religious-group is part</a> and
<a name="1645qlink7">parcel of Hollywood's religious few's new found flirtation with bring
religion into television and film.</a>
