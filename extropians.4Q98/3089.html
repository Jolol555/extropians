<p>
That's no part of anarcho-capitalism as I understand it. Smells like a red
herring to me.</a>

<p>
<a name="3120qlink2">That'd be an interesting project. But it wouldn't convince anyone who
wasn't willing to be convinced. We all have the history of failed
interventionist policies before our eyes - there's a real-time model, if
you will - yet the True Believers are still parroting the same tired
nostrums (basically, we need more of the same) as if they've learned
nothing. Which they haven't, because they don't want</a> to.

<p>
<a name="3120qlink3"><a href="3080.html#3089qlink7">&gt;Certain Asian cultures have a much different perception of freedom</a><br>
<i>&gt;and the value of freedom than Americans do.</i><br>

<p>
No doubt, and that's precisely why they live in an economic quagmire.</a>

<p>
Of course, Americans themselves differ widely in their views on freedom.
Some claim the freedom to live off other people's efforts, for instance.

<p>
<a href="3080.html#3089qlink8">&gt;If you don't want to give your money, yet you are forced to, then you are</a><br>

<a href="3080.html#3089qlink9">&gt;not to this extreme.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3120qlink4">"Extreme" means nothing. Is my view correct, or is it not? I don't care how
most people "feel". I wish most people would "feel" less and think more.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;Sure I'm willing to try [the market].  I don't really know how the value</i><br>
<a href="3080.html#3089qlink10">&gt;of the product we produce compares with the collective demand for it.</a><br>

<p>
There's only one way to find out.

<p>
<a name="3120qlink5">To the extent that you're able to direct the use of people's property
against their will, you *are* in power. That includes using my money to
build a system I don't want to pay for. Take responsibility. It's
therapeutic.</a>

<p>
<a href="3080.html#3089qlink12">&gt;Persecution of "criminals" in victimless crimes is an abomination that we</a><br>
<i>&gt;must put an end to ASAP.  Ditto for the laws that allow the government to</i><br>
<i>&gt;seize property in drug-related cases prior to charging an individual with</i><br>
a
<br>
<i>&gt;crime.</i><br>

<p>
At least we agree entirely on this much.
