<p>
Well, I wrote the phrase "jump out of the system" five seconds before I had to
shut down my computer, so perhaps it deserves a little expansion.  What I mean
is not necessarily that one stops having a trajectory, but that the trajectory
converges to the correct value; so that an external observer would see a
system which is "approximating the truth" rather than "moving along a
self-propelled trajectory".  The system I spoke of JOOTSing (from Hofstadter: 
Jumping Out Of The System) was not so much the trajectory, but a trajectory
between faceless, identical goals, without any input from the correct answer. 
One can have a trajectory, and meta-trajectories, and meta-meta-trajectories,
but what I want is to approximate the truth.  I want to jump from a
self-contained, self-propelled walk in a featureless space to a path
converging on the single, unique, correct point.  It's the featurelessness,
the lack of external input, that requires a JOOTS.

<p>
Isn't our picture of reality only a point in opinion space?  A system which
determines which values we assign to an infinite space of statements?  And
don't we move in self-propelled trajectories through opinion space, determined
by our opinion of each new system for determining the truth?  One can say
that, but I wouldn't.  It describes the course of a Greek sophist, perhaps,
but not a modern scientist.

<p>
Because one point in that opinion space is special.  One point in that opinion
space is the truth.  And because we can receive, through our conscious
perceptions, messages arising from the truth; because we have learned to see
opinions as successive approximations of that truth; because we submit our
opinions to a trial by fire called "experimental verification"; the
appropriate metaphor is not a self-contained walk through a featureless
desert, but the great Quest for the Truth, the quest called Science.  Opinion
space isn't flat.  There are attractors in the system, spaces that repel and
attract, and one singularity called the truth.

<p>
There is no opinion space.  Our task is not flitting from system to system as
the whim takes us.  There is only one set of statements that matters, the true
one.  Our perceptions form a gate between our minds and the truth, and our
experiments form a stronger gate.

<p>
<a name="2158qlink1">In the space of choices, the morality Hamiltonian, we have no gate.</a>  The space
<a name="2158qlink2">appears homogenous and flat, all probabilities and values equal to zero. 
There is no way to experimentally test the value of any choice.  We have no
perceptions.  It is revolutionary enough to suggest that there is a single
point called the truth, that the arbitrariness is an illusion.  But</a> that first
<a name="2158qlink3">step taken, the second task is to open up a gate, to unflatten moral</a> space and
<a name="2158qlink4">seek out the singularity.

<p>
I don't know how to do that.  I have good reason to think it impossible</a> to the
<a name="2158qlink5">human cognitive architecture.  So - it's time to step beyond.</a>
