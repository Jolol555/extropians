<a name="1630qlink2">"[O]ne green"?  I don't know that that makes any sense.
I think that it is a little sloppy to use green as a 
</a>
noun, as that leads one to believe that it exists as
something distinct<a name="1630qlink3"> from the object which is green.</a> The
color "green" is only a property of groups of atoms,
not an object, and not a property of only one atom.

<p>
To draw the analogy with color,<a name="1630qlink4"> are you saying that "John Clark"
</a>
is an adjective (property of matter)?

<p>
Well, no, but is that what really matters?  Is a promise to 
record the positions of every atom in your brain sufficient
to make your death palatable?  I would say not, even though
nothing irreplaceable has been destroyed.  The point seems
to be not whether you can be replaced,<a name="1630qlink5"> but whether this 
</a>
iteration of you ends.</a>

<i>&gt; that I could tell that it happened.</i><br>

<p>
Of course you couldn't tell, but that is true *now*!  Yet you
haven't suicided.  Curious. ;)
