<a href="0261.html#0369qlink2">&gt;I think a critical issue with a macro assembler is positioning. Once you can</a><br>

give you
<br>
<a href="0261.html#0369qlink3">&gt;a lot of inherent clues about their position. Still, I agree availability</a><br>
is a
<br>
<a href="0261.html#0369qlink4">&gt;big plus. A lot depends on the functionality of the active components they</a><br>
<i>&gt;provide.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0398qlink1">I've been on tours of a number of manufacturing plants. There are a lot of
ways to guarantee that a part is identified by type and properly oriented
and positioned. For example, with LEGOs, put a steel BB into the center of
each block. An arm with an electromagnet can pick up blocks and drop them
into a sorting hopper. Once the Lego Block is lying on its side, the bar
code can be read by a supermarket scanner which is orientation independent.
Unidentified blocks go back to the hopper for another try. Identified
blocks are handled according to their type.</a>

<a href="0261.html#0369qlink5">&gt; I've been thinking about macro-assemblers for a long time. The model I have</a><br>
<i>&gt;been thinking about I call the Universal Fabricator Replicator (UFR), on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;principle that any engineering project needs an obscure acronym :-). It</i><br>
useful
<br>
<a href="0261.html#0369qlink6">&gt;feature is that it can disassemble anything it builds. Building one off</a><br>
things
<br>
<a href="0261.html#0369qlink7">&gt;out of generalized robust components seems likely to be more expensive than</a><br>
<i>&gt;using bulk technology. But when you can download a new design for you living</i><br>
<i>&gt;room, and simply disassemble the old one to make the new, you are into a</i><br>
whole
<br>
<a href="0261.html#0369qlink8">&gt;new ball game. Like nanotech, you drop much of the bulk transport and central</a><br>
<i>&gt;manufacturing. Even with nanotech, it may be energetically cheaper to</i><br>
assemble
<br>
<a href="0261.html#0369qlink9">&gt;large objects from largish (millimeter?) components.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0398qlink2">I did the calculations for nanotech, with micron sized components. At least
100x energy savings. Something like a tube about the size of cable tv coax
can deliver liters per minute to a home. With accelerations of 10 KiloGee
available in the distribution system, 10 minute delivery from across the
country. As with many things, 99.999% of the block types will be available
within 100KM. Some of these can be data blocks, a single block can hold
several hours of HDTV. Video on demand with a vengance!</a>
