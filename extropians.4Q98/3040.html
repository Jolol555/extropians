What's the most effecient way to preserve your identity, your 
sentience, and your mobility, beyond normal mortal limits?

<a name="3048qlink1"><a name="3047qlink1"><a name="3043qlink1">Imagine removing all of your body, except for the core neurons in 
your brain required for experiencing pleasure, sights, sounds, 
touches, and g-forces.</a>

<p>
Imagine using quantum teleportation-based communication systems to 
offload all of the functions.

<p>
You could have a little "worm" of nerves, that was a sentient being, 
with all the sensor systems made of artificial systems.</a></a>

<p>
So, you have a little carbon-based worm, with life support 
requirements.  Instead of a body, you make a little 8" MEMS 
spacecraft that flies around silently, moving too fast for ordinary 
humans to see.  For example, a person can't resolve visuals that are 
faster than 1/60th of a second.  If a MEMS disc flies around so that 
it's not in a visual position longer than 1/60th of a second, it's 
essentially invisible.

<p>
If the worm is physically located inside the disc, then there needs 
to be a food supply inside the disc.

<p>
How many g's can the worm endure?  Can the worm be converted to a 
<br>
"flatworm" by spreading it out on a mounting plate that provides <br>
additional support for g forces?

<p>
<a name="3048qlink2"><a name="3047qlink2">Would it be possible to locate the worm outside of the craft, yet 
using quantum telemetry to give the worm all the sensations</a></a> of 
flight?

<p>
Imagine looking at a worm, and hearing a voice in your head that says 
<br>
"Hi.  I'm a U.S. Air Force pilot, designed at Area 51, with the help <br>
of M.I.T.  I really love pulling G's!  Unfortunately, my ship is 
broken down, so I needed to send a distress signal through time, 
which you are hearing now."
