<a href="3196.html#3215qlink2">&gt; Depends on what the definition of "em" is, to paraphrase your Glorious </a><br>
<i>&gt; Leader. If you read what I wrote, you'll find that, actually, in reality, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I said nothing about the sick, disabled or infirm, I was talking about </i><br>
<i>&gt; the "give me convenience or give me death" crowd who make up a large </i><br>
<i>&gt; fraction of modern society; you included. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for the sick, disabled, or infirm, they're likely to do better in an</i><br>
<i>&gt; A-C society than they do today; one thing government has been very good</i><br>
<i>&gt; at is creating medical monopolies and pushing up the price of medical</i><br>
<i>&gt; care. Without them our medical bills would be much, much lower. Not to</i><br>
<i>&gt; mention that the best way to care for sick, disabled and infirm people</i><br>
<i>&gt; is to advance medical technology to the point where we can cure them</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheaply; government, with its restrictions on medical research and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; backing of the monopoly medical lobby, again ensures that the sick have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep paying out for temporary treatment. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And without punitive taxes forcing just about everyone to go out and </i><br>
<i>&gt; work full-time, we'd have more free time to devote to looking after sick </i><br>
<i>&gt; friends and relatives. Finally, if anyone wants to set up a voluntary</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialist/communist community to take care of the sick, disabled and </i><br>
<i>&gt; infirm, they will be free to do so. The problem is that most of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; "caring" lefties only care for these people in the abstract, and when it </i><br>
<i>&gt; comes down to actually really, physically doing something about their </i><br>
<i>&gt; "caring" they can't be bothered. Too inconvenient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have a great deal of respect for those who live by their convictions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly those who give up the dubious benefits of modern commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; life to look after those who need help, and I do what I can to help those</i><br>
<i>&gt; I know. I despise those whose idea of "caring" is to force the rest of us </i><br>
<i>&gt; to pay for their socialist wet dreams. Fuck 'em.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The A-C "model" is based on assumptions about the sorts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;economic/organizational entities that will arise in the absence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;government.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No... I don't think many people are saying that that is how anarcho</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism *would* work, just pointing out ways that it *could* work. Jesus, </i><br>
<i>&gt; you people complain when we don't have a ready-made list of solutions to </i><br>
<i>&gt; every social problem, and then complain again when we provide some.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Maybe a group of extropians could purchase</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;an island in the pacific and set something up.  It won't be easily, but if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A-C theory is sound it should be very profitable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh come on... how long would it last before Bill Clinton used it as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; convenient target to get out of impeachment proceedings? The only way it</i><br>
<i>&gt; could work would be to threaten to instantly nuke any country who took</i><br>
<i>&gt; action against it... and defence against hundreds of scared competing </i><br>
<i>&gt; nation-states would seriously cut into profits. It will happen sooner or</i><br>
<i>&gt; later, but the first libertarian state is going to have to fight like hell</i><br>
<i>&gt; to survive, unless Y2K takes the Feds down.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I think what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm doing is a proper function of a minimalist government, i.e., serving as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;an information clearinghouse and helping to keep the economic wheels of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;country turning.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is that "a proper function of a minimalist government"? Surely </i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses can set up their own information clearinghouses? I certainly </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't see "serving as an information clearinghouse" mentioned anywhere in </i><br>
<i>&gt; my copy of the Constitution; do they give you a different version when you </i><br>
<i>&gt; join the Feds?</i><br>
