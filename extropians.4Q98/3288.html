<p>
You are correct here. There is no real difference except in degree. A
corporate monopoly only controls one product or market, or at most a couple
markets. A government controls them all in an exclusive territory. A
government is also an absolute monopoly, while a corporate monopoly may have
competitors in the market that have relatively minor market shares. This is a
very important distinction, as even in a monopolized market, there is still
the possiblity of using a competitors products, but at some cost to the
consumer. Under a government there is no choice under any circumstances,
unless you count emigration to another government's territory and any
attendant fees or asset losses as a result as a cost. In which case, the cost
of using any competitor to a particular government is rather high, if it is
present at all (note governments that do not allow emigration, and governments
that make immigration rather difficult).

<p>
In order to prevent any company from becoming a monopoly for a long enough
period to gain significant control over people lives, enough to become a
government, there needs to be a relatively low cost of innovation (which will
result in a high rate of technological change). There also needs to be a lack
of existing government that will protect such companies.
