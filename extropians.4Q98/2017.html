I've actually tried very hard over the last week not to insult your position, but
your solutions to these issue are quite frankly very difficult to take seriously.  I
have always tried to respect other peoples opinions no matter how extreme, but I'll
be frank when I say that someone of your obvious intelligence advocating a
tyrannical police state is probably the most offensive thing you can say short of
calling me names or physically injuring me.  So I will continue to call it as I see
it:  Your position is extreme and elitist.  As an up-wing libertarian, your position
<a name="2040qlink1">is at the exact opposite side of the spectrum as mine.</a>  If I had to classify it -
<a name="2040qlink2">I'd say you are an extremely right-wing authoritarian, even by American standards.
Short of name calling, I see no significant difference between</a> you and a particular
<a name="2040qlink3">right-wing party prominent in Europe in the 1930's and 40's.</a>  Except in this case,
all you have managed to do is eliminate what was politically expedient then and
substitute it for more legitimate criminal activity now.  Your methods and means of
political execution appera to me identical in all other respects.

<p>
<a name="2040qlink4">Gathering by the relative silence on this list in response to your political
suggestions, I felt more apt (regardless of my future reputation on this list)
in speaking out.  Call me irrational, or emotional, I could care less whether</a> I meet
<a name="2040qlink5">the standards of a 'Spock' or 'Data' .  I am neither a Vulcan or an android,</a> I care
<a name="2040qlink6">about my freedom, and I take great offense when intelligent people like yourself
taking a swipe at it - so</a> be it...

<p>
<a name="2040qlink7">Regarding my LSD solution, which unlike yours has actually been tested, actually
works.</a>  What evidence do you have, outside of your own mental fabrication, that your
<a name="2040qlink8">ideas have any merit at all?</a>
