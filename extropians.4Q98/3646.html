I find this rather odd.  Maybe it's a gender thing...I dunno.

<p>
In MY experience the "kids"...that is anyone under forty but particularly
under thirty , try to "suck up" to ME.  ( I'm forty eight next month)...they
try to prove how "big and bad" they are....that they can do things just as
well as I can. (Driving a truck...interstate Owner Operator...Heavy Haul)

<p>
Of course they can't.  Old age and deceitfulness will overcome youth and
ability everytime.  (actualy...it's experience.  I've been there and done that
Sooooooooo many times...the young guys haven't a clue.)

<p>
And anyway...why should I CARE if some young punk includes me in his
kindergarten peer group or not?  


<p>
Oh Well...
