<a name="0059qlink1">I've been reading a bit of Ginsberg, Kerouac and Snyder. All Zen Buddhists
from the Beat culture.</a>  They wrote/talked about what they considered to be
the major problems of the day -- computers, pollution, population and
consumption.  They viewed ecology as a mandala. Their voice was mellow and
compassionate yet cutting, while encouraging society to think ahead and to
problem solve, even though this is before think tanks and brain trusts.  

<p>
<a name="0061qlink1"><a name="0057qlink1">I don't think that conventional Buddhism ties in so neatly to extropianism,
mainly because of reincarnation and the acceptance of suffering and  that
it can only be eliminated by a spiritual overcoming.  Accepting suffering
is accepting death.<a name="0062qlink1">  Overcoming suffering through spirituality</a> is a fairy
tale reality and pseudoscience.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="0057qlink2">Zen Buddhism gets a little closer in its systematic thought that
enlightenment can be attained through meditation, self-contemplation, and
intuition rather than through faith and devotion.  A bit more rational, but
not quite there.</a>

<p>
This is only have of the pie.  The other half are the applications of
science and technology to achieve enlightment which emphasizes the use of
reason to scrutinize previously accepted doctrines and traditions to bring
about many (trans)humanitarian reforms.

<p>
I like a poetic aspect of zen.  Becoming one with what I am doing. I enjoy
creative visualization.  However, I tend to look at it in more cognitive
science, that I focus my mind on mental tasks, become absorbed in the
tasks, and the process of preforming them.
