I don't think you could put up many (any?) statements that even all the
relatively like-thinking people of this list would agree to.  I, for one,
am not sure about the example moral 'fact' presented above.</a>  I may be a
very small minority but i would say large enough to refute its claim to
moral fact. And judging from Eliezer's rational, i would say you wouldn't
get him to agree to any moral statement you might put forward.  Are we
going to assign probabilities in terms of percentage of people agreeing
with each moral?

<a name="2295qlink2">But what about the response coming from most of the people i talk to who
reject the idea of avoiding death and seem disgusted with the idea of even
living any 'longer than you should', maybe even sometimes using terms like
'morally wrong'?</a>  Is surviving really a 'good' thing? They obviously don't
think so.  I see no common all-of-humanity ground to create an objective
