<a name="0369qlink2">I think a critical issue with a macro assembler is positioning. Once you can
position components accurately and verify that they are there, you can also
position work tools and build the components. I don't think lego</a> blocks give you
<a name="0369qlink3">a lot of inherent clues about their position. Still, I agree</a> availability is a
<a name="0369qlink4">big plus. A lot depends on the functionality of the active components they
provide.</a>

<a name="0369qlink5"> I've been thinking about macro-assemblers for a long time. The model</a> I have
been thinking about I call the Universal Fabricator Replicator (UFR), on the
principle that any engineering project needs an obscure acronym :-). It useful
</a>
<a name="0369qlink6">feature is that it can disassemble anything it builds. Building one</a> off things
<a name="0369qlink7">out of generalized robust components seems likely to be more expensive than
using bulk technology. But when you can download a new design for you living
room, and simply disassemble the old one to make the new, you are into</a> a whole
<a name="0369qlink8">new ball game. Like nanotech, you drop much of the bulk transport and central
manufacturing. Even with nanotech, it may be energetically cheaper</a> to assemble
<a name="0369qlink9">large objects from largish (millimeter?) components.
