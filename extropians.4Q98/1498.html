Ha-ha. Current astronautics is a risky job, where people occasionally
get stretched beyond their limits. Intelligence, physical strength,
stamina, ability to work under stressfull, and sometimes extreme 
conditions for prolonged periods are required. No intrinsic gender
bias ever existed, but during the early years most astronauts were
recruited from exceptional military jet pilots, where women were
traditionally underrepresented. The early women in space was mostly a
PR gag during Cold War, and meant almost the physical end of the very 
first one.

It will be interesting to see how pigs in space of any  gender will 
compete with the emerging third: advanced automation. How many 
NEAP, lunar or deep space missions could one have for the price 
of one ISS, I wonder?

I am not aware of any comparative studies in feline intelligence. As
to intelligence, you have to normalize brain weight in relation to
body mass (search for (Dawkins's?) cerebralization quotient). You 
must also correct for differing brain archetecture: higher primates 
and cetaceans are hardly comparable. 

<p>
As the neuron has a minimal size, obviously there is a limit how small
a brain can become. It would be interesting to see how brain intelligence
(=computational resource) scales up with bulk -- within limits, in
humans there seems to be little if any correlation between brain 
mass and IQ. 

<p>
Btw, how do you think can one measure the intelligence distinctly 
beyond the human scala, and how does superhuman intelligence scales 
up with system size, optimal ('omega') hardware assuming? Linear,
exponential, asymptotic?
