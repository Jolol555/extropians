hmmm... 

<p>
 ok, i am the one who originally posted that admitedly naive posting
 (somewhat legitimate - someone tounge-in-cheek) about cloneing 
  the 'perfect' mate by simply altering the gender . . .

<p>
  but i found the psychological aspect of these responses even more 
  interesting than the real "can it be done" scientific stuff . . .


<p>
  some shared sentiments:


<p>
 'Why should "someone just like me" be at all 
  psychologically compatible with me?'

<p>
<a href="3387.html#3545qlink1">  'And why should I find myself physically perfect?'</a><br>

<p>
<a href="3387.html#3545qlink2">  'While I would share my own fetishes, therrte's no reason why I should be</a><br>
  physically or psychologically attracted to myself.'

<p>
  'If I were a member of the opposite sex I wouldn't touch me with a barge <br>
  pole....a can be a complete neurotic nightmare......knowing this, I 
  wouldn't want to get together with a clone of myself as they would be 
  the same, and surely my clone wouldn't want to be with me, for the same 
  reason........'

<p>
<a href="3436.html#3545qlink3">  'furthermore, why would one consider an opposite gender clone any</a><br>
  more sexually attractive than a sibling?  i wouldnt consider my clone
  particularly sexy.  surely i can do better than... me.'



<p>

<p>
P.S.  somebody asked: "(Isn't this thread getting silly? 
Or perhaps it was utterly silly from the beginning.)"

<p>
  It WAS silly from the beginning, but still an entertaining idea..

<p>
   Everybody knows that the best way to create a perfect mate 
   is simply to upload your mind into one of those 'real dolls'
   like Howard Stern has sitting in his studio... ; )   (apologies for the 
   reference to anyone who doesn't get the E! entertainment channel)
