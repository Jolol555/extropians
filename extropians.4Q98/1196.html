I remember most of the studies reporting positive correlations between HOURS
of TV watched and GRADES, IQ, etc were samples of families who limited not
only hours watched but what was watched. If these parentis had a higher than
average IQ or university education I would hope the studies did partial
correlations on these variables as well. It may not be TV at all but an
environmental and genetic correlation being picked up.

<p>
Someone needs to go back and do a methods and meta analysis.

<p>
The real study I am waiting for is one evaluating children on unsupervised
TV watching and Total Hours watched vs. belief in consumerism, faith in
advertising messages, etc
