<p>
Joe again:
<br>
<a href="2811.html#2835qlink1">"And who did the government sell these trees to?  The corporations</a><br>
whose big bucks campaign contributions and professional lobbyists
persuaded same. This graft should be outlawed, and its subsequent
perpetrators prosecuted. When trees are replanted, they are usually
<a name="2863qlink1">of the one harvestable type, in straight rows.  To call this the
maintainence of an ecosystem would be laughable, if it weren't so
disastrous."</a>

<p>
Even if this nonsense were correct, it would still argue against the
efficacy of governmental management, and in favor of a free market, immune
to political machinations.

<p>
More:
<br>
<a href="2811.html#2835qlink2">"And as I have said before, communist countries were</a><br>
totalitarian corporations masquerading as universal labor unions."

<p>
You obviously have in mind a rather eccentric definition of "corporation".

<p>
