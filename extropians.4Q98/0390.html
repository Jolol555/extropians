<a name="0401qlink1">John Glenn mentioned that his bio monitor is taken as a large pill. 
<br>
<i>&gt;From there it monitors his heart rate, temperature, etc.</a></i><br>

<p>
Does this pass through his system eventually?

<p>
A year or so ago the Alcor crowd was discussing "Lifelink" or some 
sort of biometer that would make sure the host arrived at the 
suspension facilities in fresh condition.

<p>
Perhaps we could create a new open standard for GPS-enhanced CDMA PCS 
cellphones that allows for a near-range telemetry link amd automatic 
contingency program that activates cell phone activity when certain 
biometric telemetry signals are received.

<p>
For example, if your heart stops and the cell phone is within 50 
feet, the cell phone automatically dials a help number and transmits 
your GPS coordinates.

<p>
This would appeal, I'm sure, to a lot of Senior citizens.

<p>
We need an API that allows for a programming the phone (maybe a few K 
of ram for a Java app), and some basic near range telemetry 
functionality for communication with the implant.

<p>
As for whether or not the implant should be permanent, I suppose that 
can be up to the individual.

<p>
We could have surgical implants, like pacemakers, or use 
suppositories (see <a href="http://define.com/balls.htm">http://define.com/balls.htm</a>).

<p>
We could embed MEMS security keys in these things, so that *your* 
phone was *your* passport, wallet, and Lifelink.

<p>
P.S...on the subject of MEMS, we could put these into our 
wall-mounted flat panel displays, along with a terabyte of RAM, a 
variable power radio with a fast DSP, and a GPS unit, and that TV 
could become a packet router too.  Makes for a pretty wide pipe if 
everybody has one.
