I was reading about your 52 Mbs over copper DSL solution.

Do you know when 20,000 foot DSL will be available?  I'm in the 
USWEST service area, 15,600 foot from the wire center, so I can't 
take advantage of their $40/month unlimited full time connection 
deal!

P.S. I heard you guys have superscalar ram fabs that might be 
declassified soon.  Any truth to that?

Do you have inexpensive laser heads that could be adapted to through 
the
<br>
air terrestrial communication systems?

<p>
I'm particularly interested in secure point-to-point broadband for 
wireless solid state (UNIX) proxies for stereo wavelet hdtv over the
internet.  Something like the black boxes mentioned in this article:

<p>
   <a href="http://eetimes.com/story/OEG19981007S0014">http://eetimes.com/story/OEG19981007S0014</a>

<p>
Perhaps roof mounted, with superscalar ram wafers adapted for use as
multi-gigabyte or terabyte ramdisks emulating SCSI hard drives in
shareware Linux proxies.  Possibly we could use small 3D 
micropositioning systems aim lasers between black boxes: maybe five 
or six such small ball-in-socket orbit joints to connect the rooftop
communication nodes into a mesh or webwork of nodes?

<p>
I suspect that given the popular demand for high bandwidth, and the 
home electronics industry's willingness to mass produce HDTV flat 
panels for a low price, the DOD and DARPA will soon let go of
previously classified RAM fabs (technology that was once necessary 
for storing terrain maps in cruise missiles [which now use simpler 
GPS chip technology]).

<p>
It's my understanding that terrestrial laser heads used in
conjunction with solid state video proxies would enable rapid upgrade to
ubiquitous broadband, enabling secure point-to-point or point-to-
multipoint hdtv (uncompressed), or wavelet compressed for entertainment
and education applications.

<p>
I'm interested in using nonlinear hdtv (frame level access to feature
films) for a visual dictionary and online discussion forums that self
assemble according to psychometric criteria.
