Perhaps logical paradoxes happen all the time but cause no trouble because
nobody can ever see them. Suppose nature rubbed out any witnesses to her
crime and brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox.

I know what you're thinking, How could John be so stupid, he must be

56,600 model is too expensive, besides I have it on very good authority that
Gateway will drop the price next year.
