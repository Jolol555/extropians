Actually, its Eliezer's AI, not mine - you can find the details on his web
site, at <a href="http://huitzilo.tezcat.com/~eliezer/AI_design.temp.html">http://huitzilo.tezcat.com/~eliezer/AI_design.temp.html</a>.

<p>
On of the things that makes this AI different from a traditional
implementation is that it would be capable of creating its own goals based
on its (initially limited) understanding of the world.  I think you would
have to program in a fair number of initial assumptions to get the process
going, but after that the system evolves on its own - and it can discard
those initial assumptions if it concludes they are false.
