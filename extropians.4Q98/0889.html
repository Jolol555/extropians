While we are on the subject of gender.....;^) 

<p>
(really, everyone should just chill out and have some fun with this...)

<p>
The film Velvet Goldmine premiered this weekend, and I recommend it as an
opportunity to see a particular kind of drag that is making a comeback on
the drag caberet and club scenes.  Those of us, including myself, who are
bored to tears with the 'drag queen' and 'drag queen' aesthetic have moved
into 'glam drag', which is a highly androgynous form of presentation that
often leaves others guessing as to just what's under all of it.  As Ru Paul
once said:  'we're all born naked, everything else is drag.'

<p>
The movie is based mostly on David Bowie's life and his contribution to the
changing perceptions of sexuality in the early 70's.  It's about a half-hour
too long, but the music is great, the wardrobing is total eyecandy and a lot
of fun.

<p>
Sin,

<p>
