<i>&gt; &gt; Your counterexample is logically flawed in the following manner:</i><br>

If they go to prison, it probably already happens.  One does wonder 
what percentage of convicted, sentenced and imprisoned rapists are 
repeat offenders, after they have been on the receiving end of such 
a violation.  There is also a clear distinction to be made between 
proportional punishment and revenge.  One is the adherence to a 
simple, objective and even ratio; the other is a subjective claim or 
attribution of intention allegedly (but not necessarily) motivating an 
<pre>
action.                                                               Joe
