<a name="2244qlink1">i notice no one in the family has offer the slightest criticism of the
technique.  these are the only two kids in the family, both sides,

and even great randparents.  over the years, toys have become muuuch
cheaper than they were when we were that age, specifically big
molded plastic thingies.  consequently my brother in law is struggling
with how to teach kids they need to work for things, when they
are being buried in toys, more than can will even fit in their rooms.

to sell because they are so easy to make... spike
