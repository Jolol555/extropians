Subjective time seems to change over our biological lifespans (an
observed psychophysical fact) - a day is experienced as much longer by
a child than an old adult, and similarly for most other measures of
time. Exactly why this happens is unclear (maybe we compare a span of
time to the amount of time we have experienced, maybe our neurons slow
down, maybe as we mature more conscious processes become automated and
we notice fewer task transitions in a given length of time).

<p>

<a href="2286.html#2311qlink3">&gt; time, either by a metabolic shift or by changing electronic clocks if we</a><br>

<p>
After all, spending a few millennia alone or with a small number of
companions might be rather tiring unless you have something worthwhile
to do. The strategies adopted by the characters in Egan's Diaspora
were rather manifold: one spent a long journey building mathematical
systems on ver own, another was in a suspended state and some
temporarily reprogrammed themselves into astronomy monomaniacs eagerly
watching the progression of stars across the sky over the centuries.
