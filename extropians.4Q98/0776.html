<p>
Food calories, as I recall, are actually kilocalories in energy terms. As for
dense distributed storeage, a maple tree's leaves are only the energy generators
in the organism. Several hundred pounds of leaves produce 100-300 calories worth
of sap per day, which is stored in the trunk and roots. The total mass of a whole
maple tree is several thousand pounds. I would hardly call this a dense
distributed energy storeage system. The total surface area of the leaves is
several thousand square meters, indicating to me that the energy conversion
efficiency of these organisms is far less than 1%

<a name="0797qlink2"><a name="0781qlink1">Nano tech organisms should not be designed with their own power generation
devices, as  that is a prescription for loss of control and catastrophe. Any
nanotech we deploy should be entirely dependent upon an outside source of energy,
a food, that we supply.</a></a>
