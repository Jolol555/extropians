My guess is that intelligence quotients are tied more closely to the density
and number of connections within the brain instead of sheer brain mass.
Whale brains are considerably heavier than human brains but the number of
neurons in a whale brain is sigificantly less than that of a human's.  I
have not been able to identify any scanning technology that allows a
determination of connection density, or even neuronal density except
posthumously.

Here's some more estimates to throw into the "how smart was that person?"
raffle:

The source of these estimates is Catherine Cox's 1926 book _The Early Mental
Traits of Three Hundred Geniuses_. As cited in SciAm's Intelligence folio.
