 Very interesting, and it prompted me to look at Eric Raymond's "The Cathedral
and the Bazaar"

<p>
a famous analysis of the open source process. Seems to me the open source
process is an example of using the Net to increase collective intelligence.
(The collective intelligence route to the Singularity). I was struck by Eric's
comments on the kind of problem that scales well to large numbers of independent
agents. In particular, debugging a rough cut of a solution to the problem
benefits from the many different viewpoints of the participants. To make it work
though, all participants must have a common agreement on the goal.

<p>
Perhaps other problems could be restated as debugging a rough cut of a solution,
and use this process. In particular, my current interest, tuning web site
performance, should be open to this. Anyone else got suggestions for suitable
problems?
