<a href="3034.html#3041qlink1">&gt; I'll not bother to refute your allegations since (a) they are </a><br>
ridiculous and
<br>
&gt; (b) in the last several posts you've proven incredibly resistant to <br>
logic.


<p>
In other words, I don't agree with you (logic was one of my strong 
suits, both in my GRE exam (cumulative score 2190) and my 
Philosophy program (cum laude).  Ad hominum attacks were 
irrevocably proven fallacious by the Greeks over 2500 years ago.  
Do you ever leave that asphalt tape on which you roll out your 
subsistence and actually walk in, or camp in, real woods?  I have - 
on many different occasions, in many different places across this 
land, for many years (it's my idea of vacationing and recharging my 
batteries to return renewed to the relative savageries of so-called 
"civilization") and I know what I have seen.  Experiential knowledge 
is known in logic as apodictic (this means self-evident to you lay 
people), and is irrefutable by abstract reasoning, since it is the 
ground or foundation from which the premises to be logically 
processed (induction or deduction, Aristotelian or symbolic) into 
conclusions by such reasoning must primordially be drawn.  Joe
