<p>
I don't think that's the whole explanation in this case however.
Because (1) I think IQ correlates (slightly) more strongly with brain
size than head size, and (2) a big brain is costly (risks at birth
with big head; heavy to carry around; consumes lots of energy) so
there must be some strong reward for having a big head, and it's hard
to see what that could be except intellectual performance.
