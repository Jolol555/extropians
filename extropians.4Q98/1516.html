<p>
As I've just recently signed myself back onto this list,  I missed the
beginning of the New OS thread.  While the contribution I have to make on
this subject isn't exactly about a new /OS/,  but as a shell replacement
for the Windows environment. 

<p>
I've been using the environment Litestep ever since the first release --
it's a NextStep-like shell,  complete with wharf, right-click menu, 4
virtual desktops, and configurable step.rc and modules.ini.  

<p>
It's fun if you're stuck on a Windows machine when you'd rather not be.
The shell executable is around 12k and it's a modular system.  I've found
it to be more stable than explorer.exe as well.

<p>
So,  what's my motive to post such propaganda to the list?  What do I get
out of it?  Well,  the shell was made by kids.  And being a child myself I
just thought that it would be an interesting thing to share with the list
<br>
-- the majority of which is made up of adults.<br>
