In an earlier time...World War Two...Fascism controlled a large portion of the
global economy...some would argue (by the definition I presented earlier) that
it still does.

<p>
In a more recent time..up until the end of the cold war ....communism
controlled a large portion of the global economy .....some would argue that
(china)..it still does.

<p>
So apparently neither of these are extremes since they controlled major
segments of the global economy and population.

<p>
I can't recall any time that anarchy of the sort discussed on this list has
ever been globally popular.  Even in Europe following the fall of the Roman
Empire the Anarchy thus reviled was actually various and petty</a> gangs
terrorizing each other.  I suppose some would call that anarchy but it has
little to do with Anarcho-Capitalism.

<p>
So yeah...I guess I am an extremist....guilty as charged.  I'd like to see
individual freedom maximized.  EXTREMELY
