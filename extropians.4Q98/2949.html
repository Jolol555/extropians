<i>&gt; right-to-carry</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;concealed weapons laws, as private citizens carrying concealed weapons act</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;implied and unknown threat against potential criminals, thus acting to deter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;crime against all, and benefitting the PPF. Under the US Constitution, all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;individuals between the ages of 18 and 40 are members of the militia who</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;purpose of fighting local crime. These are two examples of self defense in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a PPF</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;situation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2965qlink1"><i>&gt; This seems like a fine idea, (presuming I didn't mind, in this example,)</i><br>
<i>&gt; but doesn't the concept of a PPF sort of undermine the whole point of</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-capitalism?  I mean, this is my real problem/question.  If there's</i><br>
<i>&gt; only one PPF making the laws, how can we expect the laws to be formed</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly under legal market principles?  Isn't the PPF a government at this</i><br>
<i>&gt; point?  (This was Nozick's argument.)</i><br>

<p>
Well, anyone who voluntarily lives in a PPF territory that recognizes no
right-to-carry is basically agreeing to become governed in my book, because they
</a>
<a name="2965qlink2">recognize that they are slaves to the group, or are at least brainwashed into such
</a>
<a name="2965qlink3">groupthink. Such people really are a threat to sustainable ungoverned society,
</a>
<a name="2965qlink4">they may not actively want a government, but their own mental laziness and
irresponsibility imply a need for one.

<p>
Only those who insist that their PPA recognize their right to self defense at any
</a>
<a name="2965qlink5">level will remain ungoverned. Its a basic choice of being a man or a mouse.
</a>

<p>
At present day, it is the case of the PPF with a general no-right-to-carry weapons
laws pervading the land. With the expansion of the Brady Bill to all rifles and
shotguns, not just handguns, and the FBI fighting to keep the names on record, we
now have a national gun registration system in fact, if not in name. We are
fighting annual battles up here against Massachusetts transplants who want to
change our gun laws into big city style laws.

<p>
Here in NH, when a bomb threat was made in a State building a month ago, the Feds
came in and are subpoenaing anyone who has ever written a letter to the editor or
a letter to the governor stating anti-government views, and making them give
fingerprint, hair, blood, and urine samples. Rather than issuing regular
subppoenas, which require a local judge to approve, they issued Secret Grand Jury
Subpoenas, which do not require a judge to approve. These subpoenas are supposed
to be voted on by a majority of a grand jury, and issued by the prosecutor, but
the prosecutor is refusing to disclose whether the grand jury voted or not.
Additionally, they are also issuing such ID and DNA subpoenas to anyone who has
talked to the dissidents in the past month.

<p>
I am happy to say that the ACLU is sticking up for a couple of these people who
are fighting the subpoenas, one of the few times I've approved of a case of
theirs.
