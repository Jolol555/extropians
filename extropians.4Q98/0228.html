i have an idea: perhaps seasonal affected depression is humanity's
equivalent of hibernation.  the portion of mankind that has evolved
in the far north had a slightly better chance of survival in winter
if they were severely depressed.  the depressed would be more likely to 
<a name="0230qlink1">stay indoors and sit still, thereby conserving scarce energy while 
avoiding the risk of going out in the harsh winter night,</a> as their cabin 
fevered non-depressed cohorts might be tempted to do.  this could cause 
the tendency to s.a.d. to spread thru the population after some 
generations. this would explain why the russian, the eskimo, the swede 
(my ancestors), the danish, the finnish, etc, seem to have more sad than 
the jew, the african, et.al from gentler, more hospitable climates. 
whaddya think?  spike

<a name="0230qlink2">In otherwords, you are saying that SAD is a form of survival? That's an 
interesting concept, except that often, (however I have never had such 
ideas) suicidal tendancies accompany SAD, does it not?</a>
