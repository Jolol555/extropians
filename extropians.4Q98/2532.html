that the entire list is anarchists.

<a name="2539qlink1">  <li>  Why would anyone want to bomb me if I haven't done anything to them?

<a name="2715qlink3">  <li>  I don't care about defence against enemy bombers, I care about defence
   against enemy bombs. As long as I can destroy or evade any bombs that
   might have hit near enough to cause damage to me, then that's all
   that matters. If they land on my neighbour, tough luck. If they would
   have landed on my neighbour if I hadn't destroyed them, well, that's
   good luck for him or her; it's irrelevant to me.</a>

<a name="2715qlink4">  <li>  Anyone who tries to bomb Transhuman Mark will be hit with massive
   retaliation. Anyone who looks like they're going to bomb me will be
   pre-emptively nuked. Defence is easy in an era of cheap mass-destruction
   weapons.</a>

<a name="2715qlink5">Similarly for your fire example; I don't care whether my neighbour's house
burns down as long as mine doesn't. If fire from his house is threatening
</a>
mine, I'll do something about it; if that helps him, I don't care.</a>

<p>
<a name="2715qlink6">You're trying to discuss a future transhuman society as though it's just
a modern socialist state with a few more bells and whistles; it will be
nothing of the kind.
