    Thanks To all that responded, it helped, but Let me illustrate the situation a little
better.

<p>
<a name="1606qlink1">What  I am looking for is a scenario were by you could force divergence without outside
influence. Thus it is solely a self agreement. The Goal of this experiment is to get both of
you and you to  agree on different identities. Example once their was John and John now their
is John and James.  Can it be done?  How would you do</a> it?


<pre>
              I think their are interesting novelties to this situation.
              I created this scenario to help me deal with the concept of uploading and
</pre>
identity.

<p>
      identity is something that is vary important to me, but I have come to realizes that I
die everyday.  I forget who I was yesterday. I am some one different today.

<p>
            I wish I could convince a Judge of that... hmmmmm. "It wasn't me your honor it was
that guy yesterday." It is interesting to start thinking about yourself as the product of the
person before.
