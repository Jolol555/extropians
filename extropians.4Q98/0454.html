Once again we encounter the broad range of contexts in which we each
individually experience and live out the implications of a transhumanist
vision.  As I've noted before, I'm sometimes struck by how some of our
compadres who live and work exclusively in more "advanced" regimes of academia
or "progressive" communities sometimes seem a little out of touch with "the
mainstream".  I'm not thinking of any particular person here, just a general
observation . . .

I live and work primarily in a very conservative milieu<a name="0464qlink1"> and have to always be
on guard against communicating in a fashion that either alienates people or is
simply so incongruent with their thinking and experience that they have no
comprehension at all of what I'm talking about.  The stories I can tell about
conversations that have followed a question about my Alcor pendant</a> . . .
