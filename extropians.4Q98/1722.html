<p>
Hans Moravec's new book "Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind" is an
update on his 1988 "Mind Children".  The first part of the book is an
interesting personal account of Moravec's involvement in the early history of
robotics and AI.  Moravec then walks through the same basic ideas he expounded
in "Mind Children", but with more detail regarding the four generations of
robotic entities he envisions between now and 2040, the point at which he puts
the development of human-level, and then quickly super-human-level robots and
AIs.  The last part of the book seemed a little out of place, as Moravec
demonstrates that he has a basic knowledge of current theories of physics and
cosmology and then essentially lays out the kinds of very speculative ideas
regarding levels of interpretation of simulations and for embedding
computational machines in wormholes that Greg Egan makes more entertaining in
"Permutation City" and "Diaspora".

<p>
Overall, I recommend this short, nontechnical book as a good historical
document of the AI field and statement of the state of the art, but with some
misgivings about the highly speculative last third of the book.
