&gt; From: Scott Badger &lt;wbadger@psyberlink.net&gt;<br>
 
<p>
<a href="0194.html#0200qlink1">&gt; It seems to me that the idea of uploading takes this trend to it's logical </a><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion.  Freeing ourselves from the limitations imposed by the </i><br>
<i>&gt; body means precisely that we seek to possess a "will" that is utterly </i><br>
<i>&gt; and completely free from biological mandates and predispositions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Given this premise, I conclude that we as uploads would not want to </i><br>
<i>&gt; simulate emotional states in order that we might "feel" like a human </i><br>
<i>&gt; again...subject to the mercurial vissicitudes thereof (sorry).  Picking </i><br>
<i>&gt; and choosing to experience our favorite emotions sounds like fun </i><br>
<i>&gt; as long as it's under complete control.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0203qlink1"><i>&gt; But then again, every time I think of uploading, I think about the way it </i><br>
<i>&gt; feels to jog down a path at sunset with a cool breeze blowing across </i><br>
<i>&gt; my skin....and a host of other bodily pleasures.  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0208qlink1">So, why give that up? Once uploaded, you could continue to jog down
sunlit paths either in a VR world or a "real" one (by means</a> of telepresence)
<a name="0203qlink2">while other parts of your massive brain "subconsciously" (or not - your
choice) conduct their scientific work, maintainance, simulation</a> control etc.
<a name="0203qlink3">Uploading opens up a world of infinite choice without having to make any
sacrifice whatsoever. You lose *nothing*. If you so desire, you could be
a god without ever "knowing" it, since your memory and consciousness
are yours to manipulate. You could be an upload already...
