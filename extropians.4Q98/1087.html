I'm just a young sprout...not quiet fifty yet....but in the last thirty five
or so years it has been my observation and experience that there is one thing
you can depend upon from government......

<p>
If it's in their perceived interest they will LIE to you in a heartbeat...and
then go to great lengths to cover up the fact that they did lie..

<p>
Recently it's become more and more apparent that the  news media act as the
propaganda arm of government...so their credibility is also suspect.
