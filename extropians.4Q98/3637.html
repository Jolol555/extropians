I would definitely recommend Jonathan Livingston Seagull, by Richard
Bach.  I first read this when I was very young and I still enjoy it
today! ISBN:       0380012863

<p>
from Jonathan Livingston Seagull, by Richard Bach:
"...there is such a thing as perfection...and our purpose for living is
to find that perfection and show it forth....Each of us is in truth an
unlimited idea of freedom.
<br>
Everything that limits us we have to put aside."

<p>
My other recommendation also by Richard Bach would be Illusions:
Adventures of A Reluctant Messiah.   ISBN:       0440204887

<p>
Would love to hear any comments the group may have on these readings.

&gt; Do you have any suggestions of books that could open somebody's
&gt; mind to the marvels of science, provide interesting new views on
&gt; science, religion, world, and humans, or generally inspire, without
&gt; being too specialized, or difficult?
&gt;
&gt; What books impressed you most when you were in high school?
