<a name="3245qlink1">Since I've just finished my Philosophy of Religion class for the semester,
this one seems particularly timely.</a>

<p>
<a name="3245qlink2">BTW, has anyone recently posted the Thermodynamics of Hell joke? Or the
engineers analysis of Santa Claus?</a>


<p>
This morning there was a knock at my door. When I answered the door I 
found a well groomed, nicely dressed couple. The man spoke first:

<p>
"Hi! I'm John, and this is Mary."

<p>
Mary: "Hi! We're here to invite you to come kiss Hank's ass with us."

<p>
Me: "Pardon me?! What are you talking about? Who's Hank, and why would I
want to kiss his ass?"

<p>
John: "If you kiss Hank's ass, he'll give you a million dollars; and if 
you don't, he'll kick the shit out of you."

<p>
Me: "What? Is this some sort of bizarre mob shake-down?"

<p>
John: "Hank is a billionaire philanthropist. Hank built this town. Hank 
owns this town. He can do what ever he wants, and what he wants is to 
give you a million dollars, but he can't until you kiss his ass."

<p>
Me: "That doesn't make any sense. Why..."

<p>
Mary: "Who are you to question Hank's gift? Don't you want a million 
dollars? Isn't it worth a little kiss on the ass?"

<p>
Me: "Well maybe, if it's legit, but..."

<p>
John: "Then come kiss Hank's ass with us."

<p>
Me: "Do you kiss Hank's ass often?"

<p>
Mary: "Oh yes, all the time..."

<p>
Me: "And has he given you a million dollars?"

<p>
John: "Well no, you don't actually get the money until you leave town."
Me: "So why don't you just leave town now?"

<p>
Mary: "You can't leave until Hank tells you to, or you don't get the 
money, and he kicks the shit out of you."

<p>
Me: "Do you know anyone who kissed Hank's ass, left town, and got the 
million dollars?"

<p>
John: "My mother kissed Hank's ass for years. She left town last year, 
and I'm sure she got the money."

<p>
Me: "Haven't you talked to her since then?"

<p>
John: "Of course not, Hank doesn't allow it."

<p>
Me: "So what makes you think he'll actually give you the money if you've 

<p>
never talked to anyone who got the money?"

<p>
Mary: "Well, he gives you a little bit before you leave. Maybe you'll 
get a raise; maybe you'll win a small lotto; maybe you'll just find a 
twenty dollar bill on the street."

<p>
Me: "What's that got to do with Hank?

<p>
John: "Hank has certain connections.'"

<p>
Me: "I'm sorry, but this sounds like some sort of bizarre con game."
John: "But it's a million dollars, can you really take the chance? And 
remember, if you don't kiss Hank's ass he'll kick the shit of you."

<p>
Me: "Maybe if I could see Hank, talk to him, get the details straight 
from him..."

<p>
Mary: "No one sees Hank, no one talks to Hank."

<p>
Me: "Then how do you kiss his ass?"

<p>
John: "Sometimes we just blow him a kiss, and think of his ass. Other 
times we kiss Karl's ass, and he passes it on."

<p>
Me: "Who's Karl?"

<p>
Mary: "A friend of ours. He's the one who taught us all about kissing 
Hank's ass. All we had to do was take him out to dinner a few times."
Me: "And you just took his word for it when he said there was a Hank, 
that Hank wanted you to kiss his ass, and that Hank would reward you?"

<p>
John: "Oh no! Karl's got a letter Hank sent him years ago explaining the 
whole thing. Here's a copy; see for yourself."

<p>
John handed me a photocopy of a handwritten memo on "From the desk of 
Karl" letterhead. There were eleven items listed:


<OL>
  <li>  Kiss Hank's ass and he'll give you a million dollars when you leave 
town. 
  <li>  Use alcohol in moderation. 
  <li>  Kick the shit out of people who aren't like you. 
  <li>  Eat right. 
  <li>  Hank dictated this list himself. 
  <li>  The moon is made of green cheese. 
  <li>  Everything Hank says is right. 
  <li>  Wash your hands after going to the bathroom. 
  <li>  Don't drink. 
  <li>  Eat your wieners on buns, no condiments. 
  <li>  Kiss Hank's ass or he'll kick the shit out of you.


</OL>
<p>
Me: "This would appear to be written on Karl's letterhead."

<p>
Mary: "Hank didn't have any paper."

<p>
Me: "I have a hunch that if we checked we'd find this is Karl's 
handwriting."

<p>
John: "Of course, Hank dictated it."

<p>
Me: "I thought you said no one gets to see Hank?"

<p>
Mary: "Not now, but years ago he would talk to some people."

<p>
Me: "I thought you said he was a philanthropist. What sort of 
philanthropist kicks the shit out of people just because they're 
different?"

<p>
Mary: "It's what Hank wants, and Hank's always right."

<p>
Me: "How do you figure that?"

<p>
Mary: "Item 7 says Everything Hanks says is right.' That's good enough 
for me!"

<p>
Me: "Maybe your friend Karl just made the whole thing up."

<p>
John: "No way! Item 5 says 'Hank dictated this list himself.' Besides, 
item 2 says 'Use alcohol in moderation,' item 4 says 'Eat right,' and 
item 8 says 'Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.' Everyone 
knows those things are right, so the rest must be true, too."

<p>
Me: "But #9 says 'Don't Drink,' which doesn't quite go with #2. And #6 
says 'The moon is made of green cheese,' which is just plain wrong."

<p>
John: "There's no contradiction between 9 and 2; 9 just clarifies 2. As 
to 6, you've never been to the moon, so you can't say for sure."

<p>
Me: "Scientists have pretty firmly established that the moon is made of 
rock..."


<p>
Mary: "But they don't know if the rock came from the Earth, or from out 
of space, so it could just as easily be green cheese."

<p>
Me: "I'm not really an expert, but I think the theory that the Moon came 
from the Earth has been discounted. Besides, not knowing where the rock 
came from doesn't make it cheese."

<p>
John: "Aha! You just admitted that scientists make mistakes, but we know 
Hank is always right!"

<p>
Me: "We do?"

<p>
Mary: "Of course we do, Item 5 says so."

<p>
Me: "You're saying Hank's always right because the list says so, the 
list is right because Hank dictated it, and we know that Hank dictated 
it because the list says so. That's circular logic, no different than 
saying 'Hank's right because he says he's right.'"

<p>
John: "Now you're getting it! It's so rewarding to see someone come 
around to Hank's way of thinking."

<p>
Me: "But...oh, never mind. What's the deal with wieners?"

<p>
Mary blushes. John says: "Wieners, in buns, no condiments. It's Hank's 
way. Anything else is wrong."

<p>
Me: "What if I don't have a bun?"

<p>
John: "No bun, no wiener. A wiener without a bun is wrong."

<p>
Me: "No relish? No Mustard?"

<p>
Mary looks positively stricken. John shouts: "There's no need for such 
language! Condiments of any kind are wrong!"

<p>
Me: "So a big pile of sauerkraut with some wieners chopped up in it 
would be out of the question?"

<p>
Mary sticks her fingers in her ears: "I am not listening to this. La la 
la, la la, la la la."

<p>
John: "That's disgusting. Only some sort of evil deviant would eat 
that..."

<p>
Me: "It's good! I eat it all the time."

<p>
Mary faints. John catches her: "Well, if I'd known you where one of 
those I wouldn't have wasted my time. When Hank kicks the shit out of 
you I'll be there, counting my money and laughing. I'll kiss Hank's ass 
for you, you bunless cut-wienered kraut-eater."

<p>
With this, John dragged Mary to their waiting car, and sped off.
