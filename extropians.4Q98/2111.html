I bought a copy last weekend and have been busily reading through it.
Looking forward to your next (and happy to proof-read if you need someone).

That's why so many of us get onto email. Yes I am hoping to do a postdoc in
the States starting in early 2000. It would be wonderful to be closer to
the action. An annual overseas trip is very useful in getting recharging
the batteries: there is just so much energy in the States.

<p>
That reminds me I'll be on the West Coast US in late January - early Feb.
Any good Extropian events planned around that time? At the moment I am
visiting Caltech for a week, then UofArizona for a week, then Berkeley for
a week.

<p>
PS Damien I gather you live in Melbourne as well. It would be nice to
catchup sometime in RL.
