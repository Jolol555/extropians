<a name="2603qlink2">How did education exist in this country before the early 1900's?  It
was pretty much all private education.  

<p>
A private education system would work pretty much the same way
anything else "works" in a free market economy.  Freed of the
obnoxious tax burden (theft) currently required for government
"schools," parents would be able to choose which school to send their
children to.  Private for-profit schools would be forced to compete
with one another to provide the best possible education.  Those
schools with the best sucesses (% of graduates enrolled in college,
scholarships given, etc...) would advertise those benifits.

<p>
<a name="2187qlink1">Schools would exist to service "poor" families (even "poor" people in
this country have money to spend) and the poorest families would have
to depend on charity.  Surely the education they would receive
couldn't be worse than what they have now (violent schools, social
promotion, etc.) - if you even want to call it education.</a></a>

<p>
The main reason this would work is because we would have true
competition amongst the various schools.  Teachers and administrators
could be held accountable for students progress and achievements. 
Since parents would no longer have tax money stolen from them, private
schools would be affordable (the average spending per student is
usually much higher in public schools than private schools because of
the obnoxious administration).

than the government.</a></a>
