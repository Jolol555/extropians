<a name="1187qlink1">Hi all,

<p>
the following was cited as a "fuck you jack - I've got mine" attitude:
<br>
<a href="1175.html#1183qlink1">&gt;&lt; We should immediatley eliminate any</a><br>
<i>&gt;government spending in education and reduce taxes - possibly selling</i><br>
<i>&gt;off all government education related resources and refunding the money</i><br>
<i>&gt;to tax payers.</a> &gt;</i><br>

<p>
It was further suggested that 
<br>
<a href="1175.html#1183qlink2">&gt;&gt; `fuck you, Jack' might sound like a very unfair and</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;offensive way to sum up what he's written.  But in practice, I think that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;what it amounts to.  </i><br>

<p>
Of course, it _might_ be very different ;-)

<p>
<a name="1187qlink2">It might be that this person is saying: 
"let's stop taxing factory workers to pay for rich people's education."</a> 

<p>
It might be someone saying 
<br>
<a name="1187qlink3">"let's stop having an elitist medical system in which the state hands out 
million-dollar lifetime salaries to a select group of individuals, 
legally prohibiting competition."</a>

<p>
<a name="1187qlink4">It might be someone who believes in meritocracy and believes that state 
rationing of education promotes less access, not more.</a> 

<p>
To impute a "fuck you Jack" consciousness to this person is as rational 
as Freud imputing hostility where there is none because "it is just 
symptom transference". 

<p>
<a name="1187qlink5">I think that an objective review of comments on this list would reveal 
that self-interest is at once higher and lower than in any other group in 
</a>society. 

<p>
<a name="1187qlink6">Higher because we believe we are the Captains of our souls. Lower because 
we have a vision of the future which we will gladly work toward. The 
critical thing is that we are not willing to enslave others to reach our 
goal: taxation is slavery.</a>

<p>
all the very best,
<br>

Richard Feynmann, suffering terminal cancer, made the doctor promise to 
take away the anesthetic before he dies because "I want to feel what it's 
like to turn off."
