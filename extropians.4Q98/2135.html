 You are right. Just rephrase it the way you want, as long as you get
the meaning.

<p>
  But as long as you are not sure this is the truth, then it's no good.
Have you seen the movie 'dark city', where all the citizen of a strange
town have their memories changed every night in order to experiment and
understand humanity? This is the same image I have in mind when speaking
about information we would have to know in order to attain the truth.
And as long as you lack one bit of information, you don't have it all,
thus you need to embrace the whole universe to be able to be sure of
anything.

<p>
   You tell me when you are taping into the objective truth... we'll
discuss it :)

One note about eli's post I've just received but don't have time to
understand fully (time to go to sleep), I love sophists, they were great
people who were not all that bothered with objective rules, but instead
concentrated onto memes (sophistai = "knowledge master") and their
transmission (rhetoric). It's a sophist who stated that 'man is the
measure of all things'. And they believed that there is no god, and if
there are, we can not know them (I'm reading that from a book). Too bad
that nowadays the word 'sophist' possesses such bad connotations (just
as machiavel).
