Max,

<p>
Certainly professional teleconferencing is expensive and a poor substitute
for the experience of actually being there.  However, images, video, audio,
and text could be routed over the Internet in real time relatively
inexpensively.  For example, panel discussions could have questions posed in
an IRC styled medium and replies send through Real Audio.  (Unfortunately,
this is not an area I have enough knowledge in to give detailed specifics.
It will be interesting to hear what William John and others have to say.)

<p>
I do agree covering Extro 4 electronically might prove difficult to
implement on any large scale, but I think selective coverage would have
symbolic value.

<p>
Ed

The expense may pose difficulties for this idea. If someone has experience
with teleconferencing and wants to look into this for the event, I'm open
to the idea. I'm not sure how well teleconferencing works for a large
event, rather than for a small roundtable meeting. Perhaps it would best to
set up teleconferencing for a limited part of the event, maybe in a place
apart from the talks room.

<p>
If one of you knows about how to set this up and what it would cost, and
what equipment would be needed at the distal end, please let me know.

<p>
The current level of technology certainly doesn't make teleconferencing a
good substitute for actually being there. Previous EXTROs have drawn
transhumanists from all over Europe and as far away as Australia.
Marinating in extropian company for a few days is an experience that's hard
to beat!
