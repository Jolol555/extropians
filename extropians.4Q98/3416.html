<p>
<a href="3412.html#3416qlink1">&gt;I haven't thought of myself as an agnostic, because I don't</a><br>
<i>&gt;say that "I haven't decided." or "I'm not sure."  Instead, I say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I currently don't see any rational way I can accept the notion</i><br>
<i>&gt;of god."  So what am I?</i><br>

<p>
Technically, by definition you're an atheist. Don't be afraid of the word.
It simply means "absence of belief in a god or gods".

<p>
You're also technically correct in not referring to yourself as an
agnostic, since agnosticism is a position regarding the possibility of
knowledge: specifically that knowledge about a given topic is unattainable
in principle. This, I assume, is not your opinion.

<p>
Yet common usage gives rather different - and confusing - meanings to both
of these labels. Instead of fighting a semantic battle against popular
usage, you might be better off avoiding both terms, perhaps calling
yourself a "nonbeliever". Depends on your patience and that of your
interlocutors.
