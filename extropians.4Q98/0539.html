<i>&gt; Islands in the Clickstream:</i><br>
<i>&gt; A Vision of Possibilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is one thing (some would say the only thing) to apprehend that clear</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus inside our own field of subjectivity that enables us to aim our lives</i><br>
<i>&gt; with greater precision and another thing to begin building a different</i><br>
<i>&gt; construction of reality based on the modular building blocks provided by</i><br>
<i>&gt; our society. But that construction - ultimately defining a very different</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe - will still be animated by our intentionality. The ghost in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine will still be a ghost.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Three domains that currently converge in a way that radically redefines our</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities are (1) the transformation of our perceptual field by virtue</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our interaction with technologies of information and communication; (2)</i><br>
<i>&gt; the redefinition of what it means to inhabit a "human space" as we begin to</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetically engineer our field of subjectivity, affective states, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; modalities of being; and (3) the evolution of a trans-planetary</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilization including our designed descendents and other intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; species in our galactic neighborhood.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Those of us old enough to straddle the icebergs of rapidly diverging</i><br>
<i>&gt; paradigms know that sooner or later we have to jump and live inside a</i><br>
<i>&gt; relatively consistent model of reality. The digital model, the model</i><br>
<i>&gt; enabled by digital interaction, is becoming dominant. We internalize a view</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the landscape by internalizing first the forms of the media that convey</i><br>
<i>&gt; images of that landscape to our brains. The medium is the message, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; McLuhan said. Both the eye and our extensions of the eye define our field</i><br>
<i>&gt; of view. We can see this because we still live near the terminator on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moon, where the contrast between light and darkness throws mountains and</i><br>
<i>&gt; rills into sharp relief. When the moon is full, its features dissolve, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; when it's all darkness, there's nothing to see. Liminal vision is razor-sharp.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The digital landscape is interactive, modular, and fluid. So how we</i><br>
<i>&gt; construct reality is too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is noticeable when people complain about the loss of security that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they once felt. A friend said last night with some resentment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Organizations used to be loyal to employees and employees to</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizations. Not any more." What he meant, I believe, was that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; construction of reality he used to share with others in an unexamined</i><br>
<i>&gt; consensus sustained the illusion that cultural artifacts, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizational structures, were more permanent. Our organizational</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures - including nations, world religions, and "the earth" as a point</i><br>
<i>&gt; of reference for our thinking - are top-level consensual constructions</i><br>
<i>&gt; fused with the media that filter the data of our lives. The media create</i><br>
<i>&gt; the infrastructure of our collective thinking in their image.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But so do our genes. We are discovering that thinking and feeling are</i><br>
<i>&gt; expressions of our genetic code.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A consumer society in which we swap simulations like children trading</i><br>
<i>&gt; baseball cards has long conditioned us to accept the "manufacture of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consent" in every domain of our lives. A generation before Chomsky wrote</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Manufacturing Consent," Edward Bernays, the "father of spin," wrote</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Engineering Consent." Bernays understood that creating a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; context always generates a particular content. (He assisted book publishers</i><br>
<i>&gt; whose sales were declining, for example, by soliciting testimonials on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; importance of reading, then took the affidavits to architects who agreed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; build houses with built-in bookshelves. New homeowners, not even noticing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; stocked those shelves with books).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The use of images to collect individuals in groups, then move those groups,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an ancient practice. But now we will engineer the kinds of human beings</i><br>
<i>&gt; available for binding and bonding in the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The practice of genetic engineering will dovetail with refined practices of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  social engineering. Most of it will go unnoticed. Subcultures that pride</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves on independent thinking, for example, are a good gill net in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which such people can be collected, observed, or manipulated. That's much</i><br>
<i>&gt; more effective for social control than repression of such tendencies and</i><br>
<i>&gt; their social expressions. We may find it desirable to build larger</i><br>
<i>&gt; percentages of people amenable to such manipulation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That practice would simply extend what we call "education" onto the</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical level of biomechanics. Fractal levels of self-control by the body</i><br>
<i>&gt; politic will manifest in whatever media are available. Ethicists will</i><br>
<i>&gt; object, but the cries of ethicists always follow the emergence of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; practice they decry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Last but not least, our identity as "citizens of the earth" - which</i><br>
<i>&gt; intensified as a point of reference when the first photograph of the earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen from the moon became part of our collective awareness - will be, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the not too distant future, a historical memory, much like biblical tribes</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the memories of Jews, Christians, and Moslems. Whether we persist as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinct identity, like Jews, or vanish in the gene pool, like Jebusites</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Perizzites, is impossible to predict.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Our constructions of reality will change when we couple our current modular</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking with the modules of beings who have different genetic structures</i><br>
<i>&gt; and reference a different cosmology. The challenging process of negotiating</i><br>
<i>&gt; realities as we engage with the perspective of other species will reveal</i><br>
<i>&gt; what it means to be human-on-earth. If  a "human" point of reference</i><br>
<i>&gt; persists, it will be profoundly altered by that encounter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My experience in Hawaii taught me that the Hawaiian construction of reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; shattered when Captain Cook sailed into Kealakekua Bay. Nearly two hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt; years later, in the nineteen sixties, when consciousness-raising activities</i><br>
<i>&gt; became pervasive in the dominant culture, their descendents reconstructed</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hawaiian culture, but as it was seen through the prism of the dominant</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture. Hawaiian culture today is a reflection in the eye of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; assimilating culture, a simulation built to the blueprints of archeologists</i><br>
<i>&gt; and imagineers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The moment we see ourselves as we are perceived by another, we become</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone else, neither who we were nor who they think we are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How we design the reality factories of our genetic structures and link them</i><br>
<i>&gt; in digital simulations in a trans-planetary context so much more vast than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the thinking life of our little planet has imagined - well, at the least,</i><br>
<i>&gt; life in the next century will not be devoid of interest.</i><br>
