<p>
I cannot help but to see this as an argument *against* taxation.  If
fine-grained representational disbursement is an appropriate way to spend
tax dollars, why not eliminate the middle man (government) and let the
individual directly spend their money for these services?  It would
certainly be more efficient.

<p>
Perhaps a compromise would be for the government to decide allocation, but
for the individual to determine the actual spending of their tax dollars.
Of course, this leads to several other issues, but I'll leave it at this.
