Nice idea. I have to think a bit about that. It is definitely true
that the most amazing reading can be found in papers, but here is a
preliminary list of good books read the last year:

<p>
<a name="3673qlink1">Diaspora and Luminious by Greg Egan. A posthuman novel and several
though-provoking stories.</a> 

<p>
The Cell by Watson et al. Standard textbook in cell biology, very
readable and covers much interesting stuff.

<p>
Imagined Worlds by Freeman Dyson. Dyson is wise. He might not be right
about everything (I disagree with him in a lot of places), but he is
certainly worth reading and enjoying.

<p>
Introduction to Artificial life by Adami. Nice introduction to the
theory of artificial evolutionary processes.

<p>
Zen and the Brain by James H. Austin. I have been referring to it so
many times that I must promise you a review at length to explain what
is good (and bad) about it.

<p>
More to come...
