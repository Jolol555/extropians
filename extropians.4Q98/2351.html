**INSTITUTE TO AWARD NEARLY ONE HALF MILLION DOLLARS**

<p>
FAIRFAX, VA -- The Institute for Humane Studies will award nearly one half
million dollars to outstanding graduate and undergraduate students. The
deadline to apply for a fellowship of up to $12,000 is December 31--just
around the corner!
<br>
Humane Studies Fellowships are awarded by the Institute for Humane Studies
to support the work of outstanding students interested in the "classical
liberal" tradition.
<br>
The core principles of this tradition include the recognition of individual
rights through the institution of private property, contract, and the rule
of law, and through freely evolved intermediary institutions; and
voluntarism in all human relations, including the unhampered market
mechanism in economic affairs and the goals of free trade, free migration,
and peace.

<pre>
        ELIGIBILITY: Applications will be considered from those who:
<br>
        (1) will be a full-time graduate student or undergraduate students<br>
with junior or senior standing in the 1999/00 academic year,
<br>
        (2) have a clearly demonstrated interest in the classical<br>
liberal/libertarian tradition, and
<br>
        (3) are interested in applying the principles of this tradition to<br>
</pre>
their work.

<p>
        The Institute for Humane Studies is a non-profit educational
foundation located at George Mason University, in Fairfax, Virginia. The
Institute supports the achievement of a freer society by discovering and
facilitating the development of talented, productive students, scholars, and
other intellectuals who share a commitment to liberty and who demonstrate
the potential to change significantly the current climate of opinion to one
more congenial to the principles and practices of freedom.
