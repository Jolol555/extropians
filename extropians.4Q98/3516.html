Obviously yes and I'm rather depressed about that ...

What i mean is that when you think about something, being finite you can't think
to something different at the same time. So thinking about something or spend time
on something specific make you close minded to other things.
If you define yourself for example as a transhumanist  and think a lot about it,
spend time on it, you will obviously become close minded to other things to a
certain extent, after a certain time. Human machinery is finite.
I certainly agree with the transhumanist principles, so i believe i could probably
be at least on the top100 of the most transhumanistic peoples. But i see also
problems in putting oneself in a box so easily, at least i don't like it too much.

<p>

<p>
Yes, very probably... But all the teachers in my engineering schools are not open
minded ;))
<br>
95% are to different degrees of course...

<p>
<i>&gt; . In my experience scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to be more open-minded than ordinary people (with some exceptions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; of course).</i><br>

<p>
It's not very difficult to be more open-minded than the average people ;))

Well Anders, seems that you are somewhat close-minded about the acknowledgment of
limitations of the human beings openmindness ;)... but for me, it is the use of
"illusion" to achieve some goals ;)... nothing wrong about that ;)...

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What is irrational is to believe that it is possible for a human being alone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to be *strongly* open-minded ;)... to be "too much" open minded is also to</i><br>
<a href="3378.html#3516qlink5">&gt; &gt; loose time and energy that could probably be better used.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You mean "Be open-minded, but not so open-minded your brains fall out"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
In all things there is limitations. You can't spend time on A and B at the same
time. I was writing that because i was thinking at the moment to all those
philosophy peoples discussing "chinese box" and "zombies"... I certainly enjoy to
listen such debates more than a lot of peoples but for me it's just fun and
basically a loose of time in comparison to really try to build one. So the critic
is obviously for me to. My private aesthetics ;) are saying to me that it is more
"beautiful" to tend always to more complexity and intelligence and less pain.
