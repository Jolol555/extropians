<i>&gt; &gt;Darwin, Gandhi, Galileo, Da Vinci, Picasso, Siddhartha, etc.</i><br>

<p>
I've heard a figure of 180 for Einstein, but I don't know the source 
or how reliable it is whether they used a standard deviation of 16 or 
24. I know there are IQ figures available for the leading Nazi war 
criminals (though not for Hitler I think). They were typically well 
above average, as one would expect for successful politicians. I 
think Herman Goering's IQ turned out to be especially high and that 
he took some pride in this during his captivity. A few famous 
personalities are members in Mensa, so their IQs should have been 
measured at some stage (e.g. Asimov).

<p>
An exceptional IQ is by no means a guarantee or even a strong 
indication of exceptional performance. On the other hand, I think 
exceptional performance in many fields require a high minimum IQ. Any 
IQ points above this minimum IQ (needless to say there is surely a 
considerable grey area) will perhaps not correlate strongly with 
performance. The minimum IQ varies from field to field. For a Nobel 
prize in theoretical physics, you presumably need at least two 
standard deviations above average (plus a knack for mathematics, the 
ability to concentrate on abstract things for extended periods of 
time etc.). A painter like Picasso could get away with much less, I 
think. (Of course, Picasso neeeds other talents, which however may 
only weakly correlate with IQ.)

<p>
Though the field still holds some fascination for me, I have become 
more skeptical of the relevance of IQ in recent years. I was a member 
of Mensa for a year, and I have to say I failed to detect any form of 
intellectual excellence in the people I met. Perhaps my contrast 
group was skewed though, since many people I normally interact with 
are professors or postgrads. Maybe if I had been living in a mining 
community instead I would have found the Mensa people incredibly 
bright.

<p>
<a name="1723qlink1">BTW, contrary to what was said on another thread some weeks back, 
there seems to be a fairly substantial correlation between IQ and 
brain size. I've heard figures of correlation coefficients of up to 
.4.<a name="1733qlink2"> It would be interesting to try correlate the size and complexity 
of specific cortical areas with performance measures of the sort of 
activity they are thought to be responsible for. Maybe one could find 
even greater coefficients then.</a></a>
