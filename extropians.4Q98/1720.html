<p>
I asked:

<p>
<a href="1707.html#1720qlink1">&gt; Quick, what's the difference between punishment and revenge?</a><br>

<p>
John Clark offers:

<p>
<a href="1712.html#1720qlink2">&gt; Just punishment for an evil act is the minimum action needed to prevent</a><br>
<i>&gt; a future similar occurrence, anything more than that is revenge.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, the old deterrence theory. If taken as a _defining_ property of
punishment, this might indeed serve to distinguish punishment from revenge,
though deterrence, when considered at all, seems usually to be bundled as a
side-effect rather than being the root rationale for punishment, n'est-ce
pas? But we needn't quibble over that, as I think there are serious
problems with deterrence-by-penalty anyway.

<p>
<a name="1735qlink2">First off, studies have called into question the deterrence value of
</a>
sanctions,<a name="1735qlink3"> in particular that of capital punishment.</a> There seems to be
little correlation in general between either severity or sureness of
<a name="1735qlink4">punishment promised and rates of commission of the corresponding crimes.</a>

<p>
<a name="1735qlink5">Another problem is with measurement: by what method are we to establish the
"minimum action needed",</a> especially in view of the lack of correlation
mentioned above? People vary immensely in their toleration of risks, for
one thing.

<p>
<a name="1735qlink6">To me it seems much less problematical and at any rate more cost-effective
to deter by means</a> of prevention, rather than rely on dubious after-the-fact
sanctions which have only a small probability of being applied anyway (most
crimes go unsolved, after all).

<p>
(Note that we've shifted the discussion away from definitional difficulties
into the realm of practicality, which is probably just as well.)

<p>
Upward,
