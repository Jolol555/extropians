I'm not convinced this is economically feasible.  To the best of my
understanding, the cost of buying up the cars, building the shuttles and
installing a computer that can not only drive passengers to their
destinations but can also *understand where the passengers want to go*
would thoroughly kill whatever profitability you had in mind.

<p>
However, I may be wrong, in which case, I reccomend that you try it and
see.  :)

<p>
As for this, if it's profitable, then go try it.  If your plan depends on
the profitability of this cars -&gt; shuttles plan to pay for the raw steel,
however, it's probably doomed to fail, IMO.

<p>
... but then, the way you're phrasing this it doesn't sound like you're
keen on doing this through market means at all.

<p>
If you can make steel-framed homes cheap, then you shouldn't have to
concern yourself with the logistics of moving people around.  People will
gladly pay you for your steel-enforced houses and move *themselves* into
your houses.
