<a name="3560qlink1">I have to second this.  Zappa's incredible breadth and eclecticism as a
composer, instrumetalist and lyricist was one of the primary influences on my
musical taste.  At some point in the late 1970s I had a complete Zappa LP
collection -- reproducing and completing it in digital form is one of my longterm
 goals. I also have to say that, although often tinged with a sharp
darkness, Zappa's lyrics are usually extropian in the sense that they often
express informed skepticism and creative humor at many, many levels.</a>
