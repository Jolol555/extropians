Abstract
<br>
  Transgenic mice with both alleles of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product
  'knocked out' by gene targeting are susceptible to early development of
  tumors, chiefly lymphomas and sarcomas. Compared with the control group,
  administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) at 0.3% of the diet to male
  p53-deficient mice extended their lifespan by delaying death due to neoplasms
<br>
  (from 105 to 166 days on study, P = 0.002), primarily by suppressing<br>
  lymphoblastic lymphoma (from 45 to 6% of neoplastic deaths, P = 0.010).
  Treatment with a synthetic DHEA analog, 16alpha-fluoro-5-androsten-17-one
<br>
  (compound 8354), at 0.15% of the diet also increased lifespan, to 140 days<br>
  for mice that developed tumors (P = 0.037). The effects of these steroids on
  lifespan and tumor development did not appear to be strongly related to
  inhibition of food consumption and weight gain, in that a group pair-fed with
  control diet to the reduced food consumption of the DHEA-treated group
  developed and died of the same types of neoplasms at the same rate as the
  controls fed ad libitum. The chemopreventive effect of these steroids has
  been proposed to be due to suppression of DNA synthesis by inhibition of
  glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Although DHEA and its analog are strong non-competitive
  inhibitors of this enzyme in vitro, treatment with DHEA did not deplete
  cellular nucleotide pools in the liver, as would have been predicted. The
  chemopreventive effect of DHEA in this model may be due to steroid-induced
  thymic atrophy and suppression of T cell lymphoma, permitting these mice to
  survive long enough to develop tumors with longer latency.
