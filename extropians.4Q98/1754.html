<p>
I'm in the process of developing some "enlightenment tests."
This is the first. It corresponds to level-1 freedom. See
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/resplev.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/resplev.htm</a>&gt;.<br>

<p>
These Enlightenment Tests will be added to the Free World
Order website &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt;.

<p>
I would appreciate your questions, comments, and suggestions
for improvement.

We have four enlightenment tests:


<OL>
  <li>  Basic Freedom Enlightement Test
  <li>  Live Free Enlightement Test &lt;link&gt;
  <li>  Advanced Freedom Enlightement Test &lt;link&gt;
  <li>  Immortality Enlightement Test &lt;link&gt;


</OL>
<p>
These tests were inspired by "The Infamous Enlightenment Test"

Basic Freedom Enlightement Test
<hr>

<p>
I.

<p>
Reason (rational thinking) is desirable because it tends
to lead to beneficial results. Many forms of irrationality
tend to be dangerous and ineffective, and should be avoided.
(Certain creative thinking processes, such as "lateral thinking"
can be highly effective, yielding unexpected, beneficial results.)
We can continuously improve our thinking skills without limit.
One of the most powerful tools for improving thinking skills
is the ability to question everything.


<p>
II.

<p>
Individualism is a desirable characteristic from the individual's
point of view, meekness and conformism are not. The primary tools
for developing individuality are questioning, exploration,
experimentation, and self-expression.


<p>
III.

<p>
"Political correctness" is usually a euphemism for "dogmatic nonsense."
For example, all people are not equal. We are all unique individuals
with considerable differences.


<p>
IV.

<p>
The foundations of basic freedom are: (a) property rights; (b) voluntary
association and exchange; and (c) responsible contracts -- keeping your
word. Of utmost importance is that nobody has the right to coerce another,
i.e., initiate force, fraud, or violence against another.


<p>
V.

<p>
The right to keep and bear arms is a sound principle which furthers
personal empowerment and tends to reduce crime. 


<p>
VI.

<p>
The state should stay out of matters such as drug use/sale, gambling,
promiscuity, prostitution, pornography, abortion, and euthanasia. As
long as an action doesn't harm anyone else against their will, it
shouldn't be illegal. You have every (moral) right to ignore any law
that violates this principle (at your own risk, of course). 


<p>
VII.

<p>
One should take responsibility for the consequences of one's own
actions. For example, blaming tobacco companies for one's lung
cancer, a (possible) result of smoking, indicates irresponsibility. 


<p>
VIII.

<p>
Sanctimoniousness, ignorance, obedience, fear, and cowardice are among
the most destructive factors in Western society. Things like poverty,
high crime rates, the war on drugs, problems with [too many and the
wrong type of] immigrants, high taxes, and coercive rule by a rich
elite (oligarchy or plutocracy) all result from these factors. 


<p>
IX.

<p>
Generally speaking, people get the kind of government they deserve.
Although many people complain about the status quo, very few have the
courage and wisdom to take effective action resulting in positive change.
In a world with a majority of rational people, many of today's problems,
such as those caused by warped political and religious ideologies, simply
wouldn't exist. The self-perpetuating cycle of ignorance, obedience, fear,
and cowardice is the proverbial "root of all evil."


<p>
X.

<p>
Co-operation with like-minded people is very important, especially for
anyone who agrees with most of the above.
