<p>
<a name="1767qlink4">'Justice'?!?  I could just as easily say that justice demands that you
should die for speaking on a street corner.  Certainly China views such
penalties as justice for those who buck the Party's dogma. You accept as
dogma that justice equals an 'eye for an eye'. I do not share your
definition of 'Justice'.  Since when is justice written down in stone?
Why should I accept your definition over another?  Imposing your sense
of justice over others is not a very 'just' thing to do.</a>

<p>
<a name="1767qlink6">How have I forgotten the victim?  The victim is dead, but not
forgotten.  You refuse to acknowledge that the victim is dead.  The
majority of your argument is resting on the imaginary concept that
somehow we are helping the victim by killing their murderer.    Are you
suggesting that we are helping them in the afterlife?  If so, what proof
do you have that they live in this afterlife?</a>
