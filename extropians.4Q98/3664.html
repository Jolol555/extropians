<i>&gt;Both the libertarians stock solution to spectrum allocation and Coase's</i><br>

<i>&gt;should I have to get a license from Coase's Broadcast Equipment Commission?</i><br>
<i>&gt;As long as my peaceable use of spectrum does not interfere with any neighbor's</i><br>
<i>&gt;use, I should be allowed to broadcast as I see fit.  </i><br>

<p>
When exactly did these "existing property rights" exist?  If you bought your
US property in the last half century you surely realized that it came with 
FCC specified limits on local spectrum use.  If you bought it two centuries
ago it seems hard to say what spectrum rights it came with, as people weren't
knowingly using the spectrum then.

<p>
We could also say that two centuries ago each of us had an implicit right to 
walk anywhere we wanted on the moon, and so any auction of moon property now
would violate those ancient rights.  Isn't that a silly argument?  

<p>
And even if someone's reasonably implicit rights were at some point in the 
past violated, it is not clear to me what that implies about current rights.
As we all know, most land has been stolen many times over in the past.
