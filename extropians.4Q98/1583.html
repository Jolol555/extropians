Like you, I traveled the world and for along time I was accompanied by
at least two twenty foot containers. This load reduced and eventually
got to the point where I considered digitizing my filing cabinets. In
1995, I scanned 150Kg of important paper at around 20 pages per megabyte
using fax and OCR software on my Apple Mac. These files had long been
highly integrated with Quicken, so it was easy for me to find any piece
of paper and/or image via the computer. Back in 1995 storage was still
at a premium and I made the mistake of stuffing too much (i.e., &gt;50%)
into my disks. For years I had carried so much data with me that finally
upgrading and consolidation of this load of compressed stuff became a
nightmare and in trying to organize and backup my way out of this
seemingly wet paper bag of data the inevitable happened and great chunks
of data were lost fell away in a series of stupid mistakes. The point
about this loss is that it somehow seemed less painful after it was
digitized than if it were say lost in a house fire, however I still have
all my Quicken databases of over eighty thousand entries and this is a
useful memory jogger whenever I want to travel down memory lane. I can't
advise on the necessary level of compulsive behavior that one needs to
maintain a paperless existence but now that I and fate have trimmed a
lot of fat from my files, I still feel fine, at least now the the net is
so much part of my life.

<a href="1570.html#1583qlink2">&gt; Is it doable, or a pipe dream?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How long do you take for a single book on the average?</i><br>

<p>
I worked for two solid weeks to scan the quantity mentioned above.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1570.html#1583qlink3">&gt; Did you do straight bitmaps or went for the whole hog (OCR)?</a><br>

<p>
Like I said fax and OCR was all I had at the time but even nowadays
would be a better format than using a scanner with its cumbersome
images.

<p>

<a href="1570.html#1583qlink4">&gt; What is your storage medium?</a><br>

<p>
Disk.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; Retrieval method?<br>

<p>
Quicken in strict account/date order.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1570.html#1583qlink5">&gt; Migration strategy to future storage media?</a><br>

<p>
hope and pray that you don't loose it.
