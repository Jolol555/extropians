so then brian you take the book as fact?  i saw the movie with a
friend who went to harvard and had met dr. davis.  the movie was
really scarey, because you didnt know if any given scene was
reality or a drug induced halucination.  agreed, the movie bore little
resemblance to the book.

<p>
the reason i brought it up was i had an intriguing idea.  haiti is
certainly
<br>
a preindustrial technology level, yet they managed to discover a drug
(tetradotoxin) that does something that we smart guys couldnt yet do:
simulate death.  they also figured out the antidote.  nowthen, if the
haitians could do it, why not the jews of 2k yrs ago?  could not the
followers of jesus christ have given him death-simulating drugs in
order to get the romans to release his body, then revived him and
set up a resurrection story?  just a thought.  spike
