<a name="0071qlink1">I think you meant meditate, right?</a>  I would think that the
Extropian approach to meditation might include the use
of what are typically referred to as "mind machines" or
"light/sound machines".  These little electronic devices
use flashing lights and sounds (through goggles and
headphones) to *induce* various states of consciousness.
I have one and it does work.  One of the difficult aspects of
meditation for me was getting down to that almost hypnogogic
state then trying to stay there without falling asleep or becoming
distracted and rising out of the state.  Taking advantage of a
phenomenon in the brain referred to as "the frequency following
response", the light/sound machine ramps me downward to a
dominant brain wave frequency and holds me there for whatever
time period I specify.  There are also devices designed to induce
lucid dreams for those who were discussing this interesting
phenomenon.<a name="0069qlink1">  You can get free demo software to try it out yourself
through your PC at <a href="http://www.futuremind.com">http://www.futuremind.com</a> I just found it and
haven't tried it yet but let's see what happens, shall we?

Of course the manufacturers and vendors often claim that these
things can do about everything except walk your dog.

P.S.  I think I've finally found the appropriate quote to follow my
signature.
