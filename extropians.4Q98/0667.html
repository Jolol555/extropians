<p>
Active-shield based virtually infinite computing resources performing 
operations logistics management to steer people around like toys 
makes a lot of sense.

<p>
Simply make everybody's dreams come true simultaneously: pairing 
supply with demand on the level of personality profiles.

<p>
Essentially automating the dating and mating game, hooking up need 
with gratification, problem with solution.

<p>
No more need for the Center for Disease Control.  Simply herd the 
herpes boys into charmed contact with herpes girls: aids patients

<a name="0682qlink1">However, I still haven't figured out the most technologically 
efficient and ethically practical birth control.</a>

<p>
<a name="0682qlink2">No need for natural reproduction.  But is vasectomy a better solution 
than outright castration?  Who needs sperm-meets-egg when a blood

<p>
Maybe some sort of chemical in the water supply?
