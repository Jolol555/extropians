Yes I can, because with universal global surveillance I can get any

can't have things both ways.</a></a>

If people are imperfect, how can taking a group of imperfect people (and

And if pigs had wings... Look, you want to create a world where everyone
acts just like you want them to. You don't believe in free</a> will and you're
desperate to prove that you're right by forcing everyone to act the way you
want them to act; this is what I meant in my last message yesterday. As I
<a name="2034qlink9">see it, the battle of the future will be between proponents of single
universal consciousness such</a> as yourself and those of us who want a diverse
<a name="2034qlink10">distributed system. The former is, of course, impossible in any workable
sense because of light-speed restrictions, but it's certainly possible to
wipe out all other life on this planet before I get off it, and that's
what scares me about these kind of police state schemes.</a>

other list members were so far above me in their understanding of these
