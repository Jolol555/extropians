<a name="1500qlink1">Spike, you really shouldn't solicit comments from parents about their

My three kids are 8, 13, and 15, (all girls). We are nonreligious,</a> and we
discuss transhumanism at home. Kids readily accept and understand just
about everything we discuss on this list.<a name="1500qlink2"> ( Well, the 8-year-old is
</a>
not clear on all of the math.)<a name="1500qlink3"> The big problem is that we live in
a culture that finds atheism and transhumanism to be nutty ideas.</a> The
<a name="1500qlink4">problem as a parent is to teach the kids to be discreet and to respect
other people's religion,</a> without encouraging deceptive and secretive
behaviour generally. Our approach has been to introduce mainstream
judeo-christian bible stories to the kids as myths and legends, similar to
fairy tales or greek and roman myths and legends, with the difference being
that many people profess to believe that the bible stories are true.
We point out that the greeks believed in their myths, too. This is a pretty
good way to introduce some scepticism and critical thinking, also. The
kids are doing OK so far.
