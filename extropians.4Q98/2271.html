<p>
Our universe may have had a beginning but that's no reason to think all of them must have.
Anyway, it wouldn't bother me much if the conservation laws were being violated, all of the
interpretations demand new physics someplace or worse as in Copenhagen, the abandonment
of the idea of a real world. Well perhaps it's true, maybe there is no there there, perhaps not,
but whatever is true one thing is certain, it's weird.
