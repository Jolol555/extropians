<a href="2532.html#2715qlink2">&gt;I realise you use a different version of the English language to the rest</a><br>

<i>&gt;that the entire list is anarchists.</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;can't, do we just let your neighbour get away with something for nothing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Why would anyone want to bomb me if I haven't done anything to them?</i><br>


<p>
<a name="2921qlink1"><a name="2920qlink1">They want your country?</a></a>

<p>
<a href="2532.html#2715qlink3">&gt;2. I don't care about defence against enemy bombers, I care about defence</a><br>
<i>&gt;   against enemy bombs. As long as I can destroy or evade any bombs that</i><br>
<i>&gt;   might have hit near enough to cause damage to me, then that's all</i><br>
<i>&gt;   that matters. If they land on my neighbour, tough luck. If they would</i><br>
<i>&gt;   have landed on my neighbour if I hadn't destroyed them, well, that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;   good luck for him or her; it's irrelevant to me.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="2921qlink2"><a name="2920qlink2">Great.  Have you seen the results fo the dresden Firbombs?  The city was
_gone_.</a></a>
<br>
bombs nowadays tend to take out large areas.<a name="2920qlink3">  You can't dodge them,</a> you
<a name="2921qlink3">can't duck,<a name="2920qlink4"> and unless you have your own personal shelter (of a damned high
quality), yoiu're probably better off investing in anti-aircraft gear and
your own fighter planes than anything</a> else.  And those are _way_ too
</a>
expensive for individuals to buy.

<p>
<a href="2532.html#2715qlink4">&gt;3. Anyone who tries to bomb Transhuman Mark will be hit with massive</a><br>
<i>&gt;   retaliation. Anyone who looks like they're going to bomb me will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;   pre-emptively nuked. Defence is easy in an era of cheap mass-destruction</i><br>
<i>&gt;   weapons.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="2921qlink4"><a name="2920qlink5">If you look like the sort of person who might pre-emptively nuke people,
don't you think that everyone else might pre-emptively nuke you, for
safeties sake?</a></a>
<br>
And are we going to move to the 'Every man for himself' idealogy only after
you become transhuman?

<p>
<a href="2532.html#2715qlink5">&gt;Similarly for your fire example; I don't care whether my neighbour's house</a><br>
<i>&gt;burns down as long as mine doesn't. If fire from his house is threatening</i><br>
<i>&gt;mine, I'll do something about it; if that helps him, I don't care.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="2921qlink5"><a name="2920qlink6">Most fires threaten whole blocks.  And will probably want to use a fire
brigade to control the fire, as inividual's have neither the training nor
the equipment to protect their own homes.</a></a>


<p>
<a href="2532.html#2715qlink6">&gt;You're trying to discuss a future transhuman society as though it's just</a><br>
<i>&gt;a modern socialist state with a few more bells and whistles; it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing of the kind.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="2920qlink7">Sorry, I thought you wanted to be a libertarian now.</a>

<p>
In a transhuman world we will all be able to look after ourselves, so I'll
be quite happy to be a libertarian.  It's today I'm worried about.
