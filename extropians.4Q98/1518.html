The new Linux is very interesting. It is now available for Mac
machines and Intel processors, and about every hardware known to man
but toasters and mousetraps. Release X.Y.Z, the nth non-geek release 
is due every few months (the geek releases at least once a day). 
It is a modern OS (L4, MkLinux), with no legacy baggage from Redmond, 
is fully 64 bit clean (RedHat/Debian Alpha), can do multi-media. 
It is open source. It is very cool. Search for Linux, and you will 
get more hits than you ever wished for. The applications are rapidly 
increasing for this brainchild of Linus Torvalds and a gadzillion 
of developers from all over the globe.

Ok, BeOS has some advantages (and, to be fair, several disadvantages),
but none that Linux can't meet by mid next year. If BeOS was open
source, it would be real dynamite instead of just a flash in the pan.
