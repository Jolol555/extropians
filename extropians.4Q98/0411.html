<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; OK, I can follow you so far: if you return to the past of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself, you were always part of that past.  However, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; we introduce the idea of "Many Worlds", another possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; arises: that we may be able to return to a past exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; similar to our own, but with the addition of ourselves (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; time travelers).  The only difficulty I can see is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; there appears to be no way to get back to the "present" you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; left.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Since it can't be tested, how would this be different from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; disintergration device?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, it CAN be tested, interestingly enough, using reversible</i><br>
<i>&gt; nano-electronics.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but this isn't quite what I was speaking of.

<p>
<a href="0376.html#0411qlink2">&gt; On a relevant note, tests have been done to see if one can travel to other</a><br>
<i>&gt; histories, (ie testing for exact linearity in the waveform,) and it seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we can't.  Take a look at Q36-Q39 in the excellent "Many Worlds FAQ"</i><br>
<i>&gt; at <a href="http://www.airtime.co.uk/users/station/m-worlds.faq">http://www.airtime.co.uk/users/station/m-worlds.faq</a></i><br>

<p>
&lt;snip quote from web&gt;

<p>
This really has no bearing on my argument, since I 
am only speculating that one might be able to travel
back to one's *own* timeline (except for the addition
of oneself as the time traveler).  That is, I don't 
see any reason that it would have to extend to crossing
worlds "horizontally".

<p>
<a href="0376.html#0411qlink3">&gt; 3)  For some reason, time travel is limited in some way: perhaps it can't</a><br>
<i>&gt; be used to travel further back than the date of the invention, for example.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, this is another point which I can't honestly claim cannot be true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; With my current understanding of physics, I can't currently imagine what</i><br>
<i>&gt; would prevent time travel beyond a certain date, but then, I'm not out to</i><br>
<i>&gt; invent a time machine.  :)</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0412qlink1">Actually, AFAICS, *all* of the possibilities have this 
feature.  In general, time machines which make use of
relativity require large twists in spacetime (like
Tipler's cylinder), and so you can't travel to a time
when the artifact didn't yet exist.

<p>
I am not aware of anyone proposing time machines that
*don't* use this sort of method...</a>

<p>
<a href="0376.html#0411qlink4">&gt; However, I will make the argument that even this is unlikely.  First, note</a><br>
<i>&gt; that if I had an engine which could move me around faster-than-light (FTL)</i><br>
<i>&gt; then I could travel back to any arbitrary point in time.  This point has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been pretty well hashed out; I think the FTL FAQ out there on the net</i><br>
<i>&gt; discusses it in a way that makes sense to those who don't have much</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics.  Alternately, consider the scenario Haradon presents:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Zeb Haradon said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;In "Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku, a scenerio is sketched out which seems like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it would work. You make a worm hole - he descibred how to do this, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;involves something with charging two sets of plates and relies on something</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;called the Casmir Effect, which has been observed in the lab on a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;scale, but he didn't go into much more detail about it - anyway, you make a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;worm hole using the Casmir Effect, and you have the two ends of a wormhole</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;right next to eachother. You then put one on a ship, and accelerate it to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;near-light speed, and fly it around for a while, then after 20 years or so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;return it to its original position. While this one end of a worm hole was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;going very fast, time was compressed for it - say it was going fast enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that only 10 seconds passed for it while 20 years passed for the other end</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the worm hole which did not travel. Now, you have a wormhole which has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;one end at point A in space, and its other end only a mile or so away, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;one end is twenty years ahead of the other one. You pass through one end and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;come out the other end twenty years into the future. Pass the other way, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;go twenty years into the past.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; FTL movement =&gt; arbitrary backwards time travel.</i><br>

<p>
Not in this case.  You can never go to a time
when the wormhole did not yet exist.

subject replaced by the "To:" address...if anyone
has a suggestion, I'm listening... :)
