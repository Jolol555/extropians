<a name="3434qlink1">Robin responds to my questions:</a>
<br>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink1">&gt;&gt;Did Coase in fact simply assume these things in his paper? What did he</a><br>
win
<br>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink2">&gt;&gt;the Nobel prize for, then?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink3">&gt;Asking the right question, even if the answer is trivial.</a><br>

<p>
Speaking of trivial answers... (Ok, cheap shot, but I couldn't resist. No
offense.)

<p>
I'm going to suspend judgment until I read the original paper. Something
I've been meaning to get to anyway.

<p>
<a name="3461qlink1"><a name="3434qlink2"><a href="3415.html#3428qlink4">&gt;Having the ends justify the means is "principled."  Maybe its not a</a><br>
principle
<br>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink5">&gt;you like, but that's another matter.</a><br>
</a>

</a>
<p>
If you think it's principled, then proceed to defend the principle.

<p>
I wrote:
<br>
<a href="3410.html#3428qlink6">&gt;Analyses like Coase's serve to buttress this belief by showing how</a><br>
<i>&gt;solutions arise on a free market, but don't - and shouldn't - form the</i><br>
<i>&gt;foundation of (anti)political philosophy.</i><br>

<p>
Robin returns:
<br>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink7">&gt;But Coase gives a *consequential* analysis in favor of markets!</a><br>

<p>
True, exactly why I said he buttresses our opposition to aggression. But in
itself it provides no reason for an authoritarian to suddenly embrace
freedom. He'd say "so what? I don't want what the market wants, there are
higher values", blah blah blah.

<p>
<a name="3461qlink2"><a href="3415.html#3428qlink8">&gt;If my liberty was reduced, that should show itself in lots of simple</a><br>
<i>&gt;familiar consequences.  I wouldn't get to eat the things I like,</i><br>
<i>&gt;live in the places I like, etc.  I could be displeased by that outcome</i><br>
<i>&gt;even without adding on an extra "and my liberty was reduced."</i><br>

<p>
Who said it was offered *in addition* to the simple consequences? It's just
a summary, in lieu of enumerating all the detailed losses.</a>

<p>
<a name="3465qlink1"><a href="3415.html#3428qlink9">&gt;&gt;&gt;I embrace simple consequential analysis as a basis for policy</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;discussions.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink10">&gt;&gt;So did Machiavelli.</a><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;To his credit.</i><br>

<p>
If you say so...<a name="3461qlink3"> Tell me, does _The Prince_ really inspire your sense</a> of
justice?
</a>

<p>
<a name="3465qlink2"><a name="3461qlink4"><a href="3415.html#3428qlink11">&gt;&gt;&gt;I accept these features because simple consequential analysis seems</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;our best chance for creating broad intellectual consensus on policy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;questions.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink12">&gt;&gt;If by an appeal to their material advantage we can persuade the less</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;principled to support freedom, that's better than nothing, I suppose.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink13">&gt;There are lots more simple consequences than "material advantage."</a><br>
<i>&gt;There's having friends, enjoying conversations, liking music,</i><br>
<i>&gt;traveling to interesting places, etc.</i><br>

<p>
What do these things have to do with market analysis or with Coase's
theorem?</a>

<p>
<a name="3461qlink5"><a href="3415.html#3428qlink14">&gt;&gt;IOW you prefer the _status quo_ of opportunistic power struggles to a</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;principled discussion of the ethical foundations of a good society.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3415.html#3428qlink15">&gt;Again, power struggles *are* "principled."  And there is no real</a><br>
<i>&gt;alternative to participating in them -- "ethical" discussions are just</i><br>
<i>&gt;one of many ways to play the power struggle game.</i><br>

<p>
You're equivocating on the word "power" - a common practice among</a> people
who - to their credit - don't want to admit to themselves the brute nature
<a name="3434qlink3">of what they advocate. Obviously I was addressing the power of compulsion,
not "personal power" or "economic power". What sort of "principle" can
justify social order by armed force? "Might makes right"?
