<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Both deductions are extreme, and move out of the range where I think the theory holds. In the
quadriplegics case, I would say the subjects score well on the happiness scale because.

  <li>  The disaster was accidental
  <li>  They are only a tiny minority in a society compassionate enough to provide resources, and do
research which alleviates their condition.


</OL>
<p>
 If everyone followed that route, there would be no-one around to do research, or even provide
help. A terminal condition.

<p>
 I was not suggesting people become impoverished. However, I did see the research as validating
my lifestyle of the last few decades, so I found it attractive. Typically, when my assets get
large, I get rid of them and restart at a lower base. This lower base does however include
obvious essentials like the latest laptop, a fast Net connection, and enough money to cushion
small surprises. Note that I don't get rid of my *really important* assets like my skills and
experience in systems design which give me my high earning power.

<p>
 I noticed long ago that affluent executives I worked with would moan about how much they had to
work to give their house new furniture, their yacht a new mast, their cottage a new roof, and
their money a new home. The answer seemed to me to be, "ditch the possessions". When I found
myself risen to the exalted state where I was mostly working to keep my possessions in the state
to which they were accustomed, I followed my own logic. I've done that a few times, and it works
well for me. I'm surprised how few other follow the same strategy, or do it only once and call
it a "mid-life crisis".

<p>
 If you are trying to maximize power though, its a poor strategy. Or you may have other goals
for which lots of stuff is essential.


<p>
<a href="1104.html#1144qlink4">&gt; A similar case might be a person on the verge of starvation.  When presented with a sandwich</a><br>
<i>&gt; his happiness may exceed anything in my common experience, but I don't see that as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument for malnutrition.</i><br>

<p>
 Again, I wouldn't recommend anything that extreme. But I do find putting my sandwich in a
backpack and hiking to the top of a mountain with it improves the taste significantly.

<p>
 Cheers

<p>
 Bernard
