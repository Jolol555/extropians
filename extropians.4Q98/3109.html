detecting and concealing lies, so a perfect truth machine is unlikely.

<p>
I say exactly the opposite:  Evolution has put so much effort into lies
that there's probably a module of the brain devoted to lying (anyone
know if someone's looked for it?), and thus it might be very easy to
detect activity with an fMRI.</a>  Evolution baffles verbal and kinesic
perceptions, but would have absolutely no reason to defend against
neuroimaging.  The inventor might not even need much cognitive science;
a neural net might be very easily trainable to decode "lying" brain activity.

<p>
Biofeedback could probably suppress the "lying" cues, but not the
resulting "subject is using biofeedback" cues.

<p>
<a name="3409qlink1">Do I swear it would work?  Of course not.  But</a> as a science-fictional
<a name="3409qlink2">premise, it is completely plausible.  What</a> is not plausible, IMHO, is
<a name="3409qlink3">that this invention would result in an age of world peace.</a>  Widespread
</a>
<a name="3409qlink4">violent chaos followed by totally new forms</a> of government would be my guess.

<p>
<a name="3409qlink5"><a name="3343qlink1">The effect would be to strengthen all forms of power.</a>  Democracies could
<a name="3409qlink6">enforce honesty; dictators could enforce obedience.</a>  The democracies
<a name="3409qlink7">would win, but first there'd be an interregnum</a> in the democracy -
<a name="3409qlink8">politicians and bureaucracies, faced with en</a> masse unemployment, would
band together and do anything to hold onto power.</a>  (The modern U.S. is a
<a name="3409qlink9">factionalized oligarchy with the demos holding</a> the balance of power, and
<a name="3409qlink10">the oligarchic factions competing to please the demos.</a>  The threat of a
<a name="3409qlink11">truth machine might cause the factions to unite against</a> the demos, like
<a name="3409qlink12">term limits but more so.)</a>
