  IAN: Good points! Buddhism also shares a very deep
  connection to Extropian-AI philosophy, which is the 
  claim that the mind isn't inhabited by a spirit, that
  the self-nature of mind, of the ego, is void.  "Self"
  is an illusion produced by neuroanatomy, and as such,
  a highly sophisticated computer could do the same.

<p>
  Of course, there is ground for disagreement between
  Buddhist and Western thought that centers on the issue
  of consciousness. The prevailing Buddhist view on the 
  true nature of consciousness is that consciousness is
  a neutral, free-base that's the basis of everything, 
  and yet its self-nature is void, without locality,
  without recognition of form, name, or place.  A
  state of oblivion that is just being. But this
  free base is as available to a computer as it 
  is to a brain, since it is all space-time.

<p>
  The view would purport that consciousness is the 
  space-time field, which brains localize by illusion.
