<p>
In the fruit fly experiments, the Chicago researchers determined that the
genetic variations held in reserve depended on a protein called Heat shock
protein 90.

<p>
Hsp90 is known as a chaperone protein. As temperatures rise, it prevents
other proteins from going awry and disrupting normal cell functions and
growth, and also prevents degenerative diseases. 

<p>
However, Hsp90 gets spread too thin when conditions continue to
deteriorate. With the chaperone distracted, many different proteins begin to
misfire in cells. Genetic variations that were held in reserve begin to trigger. 

<p>
In the experiments, the researchers deliberately reduced the levels of Hsp90
in fruit flies to simulate the biological response in fruit flies to climate change. 

<p>
As many as 90 percent of the flies' offspring emerged with oddly shaped
wings, strange bristle configurations and limb deformities. The eventual
evolutionary benefits of these genetic changes were unknown, the
researchers said. 

<p>
The abnormalities persisted even when Hsp90 levels were returned to
normal in later generations, suggesting the changes had become permanent 
in the fruit flies' genetic code, Lindquist said.
