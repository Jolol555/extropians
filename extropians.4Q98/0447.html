<p>
It's not a perfect analogy, nothing is, but personally I don't think it's bad.

<p>
<a href="0424.html#0447qlink2">    &gt;For one thing, the "speed" of transmission is potentially more than</a><br>
<i>    &gt;instantaneous.  If you insist on thinking of this as transmission of</i><br>
     &gt;information, the problem is that it can go into the past as well.  It
<br>
<a href="0424.html#0447qlink3">    &gt;can even go into the past light cone of the "transmitter", which makes</a><br>
<i>    &gt;it faster than "faster than light". Also (or equivalently), there is no well</i><br>
<i>    &gt;defined moment of reception.</i><br>

<p>
Some truth in that, if your receiver is a detector of polarized light then
it's not clear if the message was received when you measured the
rotation of your polarizing filter or when you determine if the photon
I sent you makes it through the filter or not; and you could set the filter
even before I sent my message.


<p>
<a href="0424.html#0447qlink4">    &gt;There are enough differences from what we normally mean by the phrase</a><br>
<i>    &gt;that I don't think it is useful to call this phenomenon "transmission of</i><br>
<i>    &gt;information" at all.</i><br>

<p>
It's not faster than light but this phenomenon can transmit information,
teleportation can be used to get information out of a system without
causing quantum decoherence, that's why those who want to make a
quantum computer are interested in it.  Something like it has also been
used in real world in quantum cryptography to transfer financial information
between banks.
