<a href="0969.html#0970qlink1">&gt; You do realize that current quantum teleportation techniques still require</a><br>
<i>&gt; a convential EM signal to transmit half the message though, right?  Or have</i><br>
<i>&gt; things changed recently?</i><br>

<p>
Is there such a thing as quantum telepathy?

<p>
Remember the movie "Brainstorm" with Natalie Wood?  If AT&amp;T had such 
a device, would they be able to announce it to the public, or would 
it simply be too shocking and complex for the average citizen to 
comprehend and use responsibly?

<p>
<a href="0969.html#0970qlink2">&gt; P.S,  Why would you want to monitor every single neuron in someone at a</a><br>
<i>&gt; distance?  Maybe have an extension of yourself in many places at one time? </i><br>

<p>
Yeah.  It would make conference calls between people much more 
interesting.  If the majority of callers were moved to tears, my tear 
ducts would well as well.
