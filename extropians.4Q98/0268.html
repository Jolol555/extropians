<p>
Hmmm, I think you snipped the part of my post that addresses your
<a name="0274qlink1">comments at least in part, but nevermind.  I still think B follows from A.
I assumed that my concept of my "self" *is* the story being told by the
story-teller module.  I also assumed that the story is the *product* of
the story-teller.  As a product, the story does not have the capacity to
act as an agent.  The story-teller is the agent, as are all the other
sub-systems and their interactions.  But the story itself has no inherent
causative capacity.  It may be reacted to once it is produced, but is not
a *direct* agent of change.  Thus the self cannot exert "free will".  (keep
in mind this is the argument as I understand it, not my personal philosophy
- I just enjoy advocating for the devil.)

<p>
So, I agree that the story-teller is one of many sub-systems and that it is
the complex interactions between subsystems which are required to
support the total organism.  Now . . . you postulate that "free will"
applies
<br>
at the level of sub-system interactions.  My question then</a> is, "Are
sub-system interactions conscious or unconscious processes?"  My
understanding was that they are not.  So how can "free will" be an
unconscious process?

<p>
<a href="0259.html#0268qlink8">&gt; Its a pet peeve of mine that when I say that the human behavior is based</a><br>
on the
<br>
<a href="0259.html#0268qlink9">&gt;firing of neurons, some people jump to, "you think we are just a bundle of</a><br>
<i>&gt;neurons". The "just" takes out most of the interesting stuff about how the</i><br>
brain
<br>
<a href="0259.html#0268qlink10">&gt;works, and rather misrepresents my view.</a><br>

<p>
I agree completely.

<p>
<i>&gt;I like the "Society of Mind" model</i><br>
<a href="0259.html#0268qlink11">&gt;which I think Scott is referring to. But I don't think it implies the brain</a><br>
is
<br>
<a href="0259.html#0268qlink12">&gt;"just" a collection of neural sub-systems. The "story-teller" may be an</a><br>
<i>&gt;important part of the perception of self, but without the other parts, it</i><br>
would
<br>
<a href="0259.html#0268qlink13">&gt;have no stories to tell.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bernard</i><br>


<p>
Right, I never meant to diminish the importance of the other parts.  In
fact,
<br>
if anything, I may have been implying the opposite.
