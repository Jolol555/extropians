i may be hallucinating this, but i dont think so.  there was a tv show
years ago called the six million dollar man about a guy who had
bionic limbs.  there was (i think) an attempted spinoff, except it was
a bionic woman.  she was the 6E6$ man's s.o.

<p>
anyway, she was in an accident of some sort, and actually
died.  the doctors froze her and gave her bionic limbs too.
problem: she got cryonics related brain damage and didnt remember
poor old 6E6.  did anyone else here ever see that show?  its been
a lotta years.  i might have messed up the details.  spike
