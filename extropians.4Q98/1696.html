How can you decide what is good for everyone else?  You can't.  So how can you say
that killing someone is better for them than re-programming them?  Let them
decide.  They can be subjected to re-programming or they can push a button at the
convenient cyanide dispensary and kill themselves.  The choice is theirs.

<p>
<a href="1661.html#1696qlink2">&gt; Your argument seems to be that you can reprogram them into a 'useful member</a><br>

<i>&gt; or involuntary reprogramming into slave labor, I'll take death, thanks.</i><br>

<p>
That is *your* choice!  And I agree that its a murky area deciding what is mentally
sound or not.  But searching for answers there is much more humane than killing
them without a choice.  Otherwise we are creating a system based on vengeance, not
rational inquiry, experimentation and possible advancement.
