<p>
It appears as if &lt;Dick.Gray@bull.com&gt; complained:
<br>
<i>|</i><br>
<a href="3069.html#3101qlink1">|There you go again. You simply assume that without Big Brother, companies</a><br>
<i>|will become monopolies. You also make the odd assumption that a monopoly is</i><br>
<i>|a defacto state. Where are the premises to back up these assertions?</i><br>

<p>
No, I do not assume that.  I asked what stops them from doing it.

<p>
<a href="3069.html#3101qlink2">|In point of fact, a true monopoly is an exclusive franchise _granted and</a><br>
<i>|enforced by government_. F'rinstance, the Post Office, or AT&amp;T before the</i><br>
<i>|breakup, or most utilities. So your question is absurd.</i><br>

<p>
GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND ENFORCES EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE -&gt; MONOPOLY
<p>
	   does not imply that
<br>
MONOPOLY -&gt; GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND ENFORCES EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE.

<p>
<a name="3129qlink1">If you do not have a State, then the State cannot grant nor enforce a monopoly
</a>
<a name="3129qlink2">since the State does not exist.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3129qlink3">A monopoly situation only requires that a group has the power to enforce it.
</a>
<a name="3129qlink4">This happens for instance when there exists only one real actor on the market.
</a>
<a name="3129qlink5">Or when there exists a few organizations on the market that cooperate and
make sure that the prices stay high (an oligopole or trust situation), which
</a>
<a name="3129qlink6">de facto comprises a monopoly situation.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3129qlink7">The organizations then have the power to decide on the market.  With no power
</a>
<a name="3129qlink8">to stop them, they can decide whatever they wish.  Thus, you get yourself
the State, except the State now consists of boardroom executives.
</a>

<p>
Those who wield the power _become_ the State, whether it be

<p>
   o  the military (as in a number of Third World countries)
   o  a political party (like SSSR, China, etc.)
   o  parlamentarism (random Western states)
   o  a religious group (Iran comes to mind)
   o  a king or emperor (not many of those today)
and so on.

<p>
<a name="3129qlink9">I can only see one way to get rid of the State and not get it back: that power
</a>
<a name="3129qlink10">cannot become centralized in the hands of any one group.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3129qlink11">Therefore I asked how do you propose to do that.  It does not happen by magic.
