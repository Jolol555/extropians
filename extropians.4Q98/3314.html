Personally I think that there will be plenty of horrible events occuring
in the next twenty-four months, but that the eventual outcome will be
positive, in taking down big government and much of big business for good.
I would prefer the world to continue as it is and for the State to just
"wither away", but it doesn't seem likely.

<p>
I hardly think the actions of "religious nuts" and "doomsayers" will 
compare to the perfectly rational actions of military leaders in countries 
like North Korea and Iraq; the US government has taken on the task of 
policing the world, the military is already overstretched and in 2000 
many of its computer systems will go down. It will be a perfect time to 
settle the old scores that have been boiling away under the US-imposed
"global peace", and that will take down the whole facade.

<p>

<p>
Not really. As far as I'm concerned they're the inevitable results of
decades of global mis-management, and they're going to happen sooner or
later; US interference has just delayed them a little and made the
consequences even worse.
