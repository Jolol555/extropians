<a href="2149.html#2166qlink1">&gt;&gt; &gt; Indeed, I personally think that it is not possible for a</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; person who honestly believes in God to be a moral person or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; lead an effective, worthwhile life, so the cost of belief</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; is very high--the sacrifice of this life for the false hope</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; in the next.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but I think this statement is simply false.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; What about Martin Luther King, to name the first example to spring</i><br>
<i>&gt;to mind?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Shame, shame.  If you mean Dr Martin Luther King, Jr., I'm afraid</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're overlooking the fact that he was a communist and had several</i><br>
<i>&gt;extra-marital affairs, and his doctoral thesis is littered with</i><br>
<i>&gt;plagiarisms.  He may have espoused "good" ideas, but I don't know if</i><br>
<i>&gt;we should consider him to be a "moral" man.</i><br>


<p>
You have a valid point about Martin Luther King, but I still don't think
that you can denounce the morality of all Christians just because a lot of
them are, by your standards, immoral. It's odd that the character flaws you
point out in Martin Luther King, Jr. are those that imply a lack of faith
and a disobedience to Christian values. It's funny that you mention
communist as an immoral political position.

<p>
I know many open-minded Christians, and I have to say that, as far as
morality goes, they have me beat by a long shot. While I do not know the
absolute truth on any famous Christians, and therefore cannot give you an
example, I know that it is foolish to say that someone is more immoral for
believing in God. Maybe a bit delusional, but not immoral.

<p>
I think we might take a lesson from Shakespeare and Christ in knowing that
we are all immoral, and therefore cannot really judge the character of
anyone, much less an entire group of people.
