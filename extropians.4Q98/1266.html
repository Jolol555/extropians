<p>
Because 16:9 is a standard internationally recognized format which will fill
the screen, and because a vast fraction of old shows were shot at 16:9 or 
1.85:1 on 35mm film; they can be telecined and re-edited for a full HDTV
frame. While some formats have gone out to 2.2:1 or wider, to the best of
my knowledge no-one has ever shot 2:1 or plans to, so you'd never be able 
to fill the entire frame without cropping or letterboxing.

<a href="1261.html#1266qlink2">&gt; Nothing wrong with a little black space on</a><br>

<p>
What's wrong is that so many people complain about letterboxing even when
they get to see more of the movie than they would with pan-and-scan. No 
media company with a clue will support a format which requires letterboxing.

<a name="1269qlink1">While I think that HDTV is a pretty silly idea -- much better to store the
movie digitally in the original format and have the TV convert it on the
fly to whatever aspect ratio the user chooses -- within its limits the 16:9
format does make sense.
