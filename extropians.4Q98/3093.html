<p>
Yes, that's obvious. But cooperation does not equate to coercion; the two
are mutually exclusive.</a>

That always cracks me up. Or how about, "Anarchists of the world, rally
'round your leader"?</a>

Why are you assuming that we can't have a society without abrogating one
another's freedom?</a>

<p>
No, they were radicals, who demanded consistency. Their principled
commitment to liberty was certainly not rhetorical, since they put their
lives on the line in committing "treason" against the British Crown. How
many of us would've joined them, I wonder? And how many would side with the
Tories because, after all, there are other important things in life besides
freedom, and maybe it's not worth the fuss because we're only being
oppressed "a little".
