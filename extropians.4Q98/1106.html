aw cmon gene, its just for fuuuuuuun.  {8^D  the poll perp would
be me, so i accept the charge.  so far the score is:

<pre>
intp:  5
intj:   5
istj:   1
entj:  2
entp:  1
</pre>
<br>
the other 11 types:  nada.   ( if someone reported a liner, i counted
half for each category.   no one tried to vote twice.)

<p>
since this *is* just a game, heres a funny story for ya.  happened 8 yrs
ago at  lockheed where i work.  the manager had about 90 people under
him all engineer/technical.  he asked us to take the mb and report
the results.  we were not required to put our names on em, but were
invited to.  being an openness type, i did.  after collecting and posting

<p>
the results, he went into this big song and dance about how he would
choose leaders with certain personality types and why.  turns out, he
was, and would choose as leaders, esfj, which was opposite me in
all categories.  he and i did not get along.  i left his group. {8^D
