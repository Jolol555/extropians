<i>&gt; obvious that I'm surprised you mentioned it!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All of my arguments have centered on those who insist on supporting the death penalty on grounds of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'justice',  a denied sense of vengeance, paying debts to victims, creating a for-profit business in organ</i><br>
<i>&gt; harvesting, or that it is extropian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Regarding deterrence, we can create the most tyrannical and totalitarian of regimes to enforce any number</i><br>
<i>&gt; of laws and dictates, but this makes those regimes and deterrences neither extropian or civilized.</i><br>

Your counterexample is logically flawed in the following manner:
As well as being a deterrent to further slayings, it is a punishment 
proportional the crime to execute murderers, for one is simply doing 
to them what they have done to others.  The children you mention 
were grabbing at things, not amputating the limbs of their siblings; 
perhaps one should sneak up on them and grab them by the 
shoulders or waist, and when they jump, say "See there, how do 
YOU like being grabbed?"

<p>
Doesn't seem so laughably absurd now, does it?    Joe
