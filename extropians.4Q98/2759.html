<p>
Of course you can buy them. Either they just sit there and nobody</a> does anything
<a name="2777qlink4">with them, or somebody or every body organizes a system of making sure that
everybody gets the maximum utility out of a given unit of resources. If the
resources are offered to the highest bidder, then the original</a> owner (typically
<a name="2777qlink5">the government, which in a democracy is supposed to represent everybody) is
getting maximum value for that resource. If you are getting</a> the maximum value
<a name="2777qlink6">for it, then you can hardly say it was stolen from you, unless it was sold
without your permission. If you are a voluntary member of a body</a> politic which
<a name="2777qlink7">does not require your individual permission, then nothing was stolen</a> from you.

<p>
Now the person who bought that resource may find later than they cannot gain as
much utility out of that resource as someone else in society, so that other
person is free to offer a price which represents the utility value of that
resource to them. If it exceeds the utility value which the original owner
places on the resource then a sale of property is made, and nothing is stolen
again.

<p>
Again, property is a means of storing resources. How the market for trading the
property is organized determines how fairly the value of the property is
assessed, and how efficiently the resources are utilized for the benefit of all.
