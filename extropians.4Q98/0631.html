<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; That dolphins don't have abstract language was recently</i><br>
<i>&gt;  established in a very elegant experiment. A pool is divided into two</i><br>
<i>&gt;  halves by a net. Dolphin A is released into one end of the pool where</i><br>
<i>&gt;  there is a mechanism. After a while, the dolphin figures out how to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  operate the mechanism which causes dead fish to be released into both</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ends of the pool. Then A is transferred to the other end of the pool</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and a dolphin B is released into the end of the pool that has the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mechanism. The idea is that if the dolphins had a language, then A</i><br>
<i>&gt;  would tell B to operate the mechanism. However, it was found that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  average time for B to operate the mechanism was the same as for A.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps dolphin A knew dolphin B would figure it out and let him have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prize of discovery.  </i><br>

that he (A) would be returned to the other side of the pool and there 
would be fish left.
