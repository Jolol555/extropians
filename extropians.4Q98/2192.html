<a name="2221qlink1">Mike, try working in education.</a> You will quickly learn that a lot of the
<a name="2221qlink2">money gets spent on "show" projects or dumped down the tube to support
special populations, athletics, etc. There is also a quest for numbers of
students over quality. This results in de facto open admission standards. At
the same time faculty are rated on faculty evaluations which turn the
classroom into a popularity contest. The result is not education but
edutainment.</a> 

<p>
<a name="2221qlink3">If we want to improve college education and REDUCE costs use the SAT score
as a criterion for admission. Stop the special admits and track them to the
community colleges where they can actually receive appropriate remedial
education to be able to succeed in college. Na, that's too easy.</a>

Yes, I graduated from a public high school in '86. I had the highest SAT score
<br>
<a href="2176.html#2192qlink1">&gt;in my high school class, that year my state had the highest average SAT scores</a><br>
<i>&gt;in the nation (while having one of the highest levels of participation as</i><br>
well).
<br>
<a href="2176.html#2192qlink2">&gt;GET THIS: That same year our state ranked at the bottom of all states in per</a><br>
<i>&gt;capita spending on education.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since then spending has gone up, and average SAT scores have gone down...</i><br>
