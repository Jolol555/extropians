And how will they prove that the video showing me modifying the data is

be trusted. The whole point I'm making is that non-sentient witnesses
cannot be trusted in either case. If we can't watch the government all the
time then they could be faking evidence; and if we can watch them all the
time then *anyone* could be faking evidence.

He was talking about the supposed inability to eliminate the state because
people are imperfect; governments are, by definition, monopolies.

What the hell do you expect them to do about it? You can't vote</a> for a

shooting them until a large fraction of the population have accepted
that shooting them is the only solution.</a>

Video evidence is a joke. Anyone who trusts it is an idiot.</a> No non-sentient
