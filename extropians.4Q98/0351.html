<p>
Actually, I believe that a transhumanist future might have no need at
all for backward time travel, because one would have little to learn
from primitive pre-singularity humans.  I think that it would be
neither good nor bad.

 
<p>
<a href="0332.html#0351qlink3">&gt; Into the future?  Absolutely.  Backwards?  Almost certainly not.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Consider: if we were develop backwards time travel at some point in</i><br>
the
<br>
<a href="0332.html#0351qlink4">&gt; future, then someone could have gone back in time to some point before</a><br>

happened.

<p>
<a name="0376qlink3">This reasoning is flawed for a couple of reasons.  You are saying that
because we do not see something, it is not there.  I think that you
are also assuming that those beings in the future who do develop full
time travel will want to journey to their own past to share the
knowledge that time travel will be possible in the future.  As beings
of finite existence, I believe that time has meaning for us, but
perhaps there is no such dimension or measurement at all for those who
have infinite existence, as transhumans or post-humans will have.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0332.html#0351qlink5">&gt; Thus, due to the very nature of time travel, if it hasn't happened</a><br>
already,
<br>
<a href="0332.html#0351qlink6">&gt; we can safely assume that it never will.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0376qlink4"><a name="0361qlink1">This is assuming much about a technological/biological future that is
very difficult to predict and will become virtually impossible to
predict as the singularity approaches and passes.  Isn't that saying
something along the lines of since we've never seen something it must
not be.  There is no other life in the universe because they have
never bothered to come tell us that they are there.</a>
