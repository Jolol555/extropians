<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can you give net refs as to how this Libertarianism doublethink came</i><br>
<i>&gt;about where the word *political* (i.e. I think of it as describing an</i><br>

<i>&gt;concepts of a jukebox, genre, playlist or database springs to mind</a> as</i><br>
<i>&gt;words on one end of the scale where the adjective *political* would</i><br>
<i>&gt;reside and words like individual, song or field appear at the other end.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thus to me a song isn't a set and an individual isn't his connections.</i><br>
<i>&gt;My PC isn't a primary internet unit because before I used the internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;my PC did other things. I know there are differences between adjectives</i><br>
<i>&gt;and nouns and that confusion between the two can lead to delusional</i><br>

<i>&gt;thinking about race, etc., this plural/singular (i.e.,</i><br>
<i>&gt;political/individual) definition mix up that you point to has me</i><br>
<i>&gt;perplexed.</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: A libertarian society is a society in which 
  a set of collective rules (political power) exist
  that define the rights of individuals.  Robinson 
  Crusoe has no political rights, and the example
  of your computer free from the net is Crusoe. 

<p>
  So there's no contradiction between the concepts of
  political rights, the individual, and libertarianism.
  The individual in society has political rights, more
  or less, but Robinson Crusoe has no polical rights.
