<a name="2595qlink2">in this fiasco.  What started out as a wonderful and stimulating conversation
for me personally, quickly devolved into what clearly became a concentrated
flame by you and Eliezer of why I would ever quote such 'gibberish'. Last I
checked a footnote is not a quote.  Besides, I was simply trying to bring the
</a>
8-circuit model into the conversation as a way of making a point about
free-will vs. Eliezer's well developed Singularity hypothesis.  Unfortunately,
both of you decided to find the most admittedly loony parts of this footnote
and completely distract the intended direction I was trying to move the
conversation.  Despite the several pleas I made to move past this distraction,
you and  Eliezer decided to continue your "crusade" against Wilson and
everything he stands for, as if *I* am somehow his loyal supporter. Get real!
Meanwhile, Eliezer and you continued to conveniently ignore *all* scientific or
rational information I brought into the thread. As far as I'm concerned you
might as well have attacked me personally - it had the same effect - complete
dismissal of my *own* ideas and integrity.  And based on what?  A footnote to
someone else's writing!?
