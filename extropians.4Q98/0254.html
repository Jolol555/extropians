<p>
There are a lot of people who believe this, but the change they foresee
is different from what we anticipate.  They expect ecological disaster,
overpopulation, melting of the ice caps, famine, etc.  Everyone would
agree that if these things happen, it would be terrible.

<p>
These eco-disaster views are very common, in my experience, more so than
anything approaching transhumanism.  You frequently see it in sci-fi
movies and TV, with the Star Trek series being the main exception.

<p>
Perhaps what is happening is that people express their differing views
more in terms of what changes they expect than in terms of how they
would react to changes.
