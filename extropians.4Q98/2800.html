<i>&gt; &gt;It is true, its easy for a hardworking person who has a couple ounces of</i><br>
<i>&gt; brains to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;play things right and become wealthy. My older brother dropped out of one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;state colleges, and started mowing lawns with one push lawn mower, about</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10 years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ago. Now he has a business worth almost a million, managing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; maintenance for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;around 40 condo/ apartment complexes and doing all sorts of landscaping. He</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;expects to retire before age 40. He works 12-16 hour days almost every</i><br>
<i>&gt; day, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;has 15-20 employees.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most people don't realize that 60-70% of the millionaires in the US are</i><br>
<i>&gt; "blue collar" workers.  What's more, old wealth is fairly rare: 75% of all</i><br>
<i>&gt; current millionaires in the US are self-made.  The richest person in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; family is a blue-collar (construction worker, no college) multi-millionaire</i><br>
<i>&gt; who worked hard and started his own construction firm.  Although he doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to, he still works 70-80 hour work weeks out of habit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What I do find interesting is that most people who become millionaires are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the "white collar" professionals who make considerably more money than</i><br>
<i>&gt; their blue collar counterparts.  I suspect (and I believe studies have</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown) that typical white collar lifestyles are not terribly conducive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; saving the money required to become a millionaire, whereas middle to</i><br>
<i>&gt; lower-middle class workers are habitually frugal and tend to save their</i><br>
<i>&gt; money even when their incomes rise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
They are also not as likely to be into do-it-yourself concepts, they'd rather
pay someone to do it for them. The white collar guy is more likely to hire
someone to cut down a dead tree in his yard than to get a chain saw and do it
himself. This happened with my parent's house, they were gonna spend $500 to
have a professional tree guy cut down a dead tree in the yard that had the power
and phone lines running through it, so when they were gone for the weekend, I
went and cut it down for them, so they couldn't object.

<p>
I must admit that I'm of the white collar type when it comes to cars though. I
don't have the space to do the kind of work I'd like to do on my vehicle, and I
usually don't have the time. I do have the tools though...... oh I love my
tools.
