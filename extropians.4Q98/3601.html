<a name="3609qlink1">The best generic type book I can think of to give a 16yo (male or
female, interested or not in science, etc.) would be Harry Browne's
<br>
"How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World."  If I had read this book<br>
when I was 16, I think my life would have been a lot different. 
Browne talks about the importance of being an individual and how
selfishness is not a bad thing.  Any kid that reads this, and
understands what Browne is saying won't have much problem with peer
pressure and will begin to see that government is not a good thing. 
Browne says very little that is blatantly anti-religious, but he
stresses over and over that we should each believe in ourselves,
rather than blindly following dogma.

<p>
When my son turns 14 or 15, I'll give him a copy</a> of it.
