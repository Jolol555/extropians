thanks for the info dan.  {8^D  now that you mention it, i do recall seeing
on tv those big wheat harvester machines.  i may have been thinking of the migrant
laborers i see harvesting veggies out in the central valley.

<a name="2701qlink2">well, there are plenty of tech museums and that that kinda stuff, but the biggest
emotional impact for me is something that one might never see advertised on
a tourist info: the farmland of californias central valley.  one can get on
interstate 5 and drive down thru there as fast as you dare go,</a> and on either
<a name="2701qlink3">side of the freeway, as far as the eye can see, is farmland, growing everything
imaginable, and it goes on for hoooours that way, hunnndreds of kilometers.

<p>
that blew my mind when i saw it.  one gets the impression that there is enough
food being grown between san jose and la to feed the world.  i see why farmers
are having a tough go of it:  waaay too much land being cultivated.   spike
