<a href="0096.html#0097qlink1">&gt;&gt;I wonder how the rest of Holland compares to Amsterdam.</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I was born and lived in Holland for 29 years. The last six years thereof in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Amsterdam.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;One year, before I stopped smoking, I had more throat infections than there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;are months in a year. Not only do so many people smoke, you can't get away</i><br>
<a name="0103qlink1"><i>&gt;&gt;from secondary smoke. It is everywhere. Even though I love Holland, I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;hardly stand being there anymore, because of my hyper-sensitivity to smoke.</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: I believe he must mean smoke tobacco. As the 
  statistics I cited indicated, 42.7% of Amsterdamers 
  smoked tobacco in the last week, which, lets face it, 
  means they are probably addicts, since very few smoke 
  tobacco now and then. That means just about half of 
<a name="0103qlink2">  all the people you know, if you live in Amsterdam,
  smoke tobacco -- that's an amazingly high rate!</a>
