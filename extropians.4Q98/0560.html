<a name="0585qlink2">Well, as someone who uses a PC with no microsoft software at 
all, I don't think that he'd have much control. :)  With no 
intervention at all, I think that Windows will go the way of
MacOS (which has fewer users now than Linux, IIRC).  The only
<a name="0623qlink4">reason he got *that* much market share is A) marketing, and 
B) usability.</a>  When Linux can match those, it will quickly
overwhelm Windows, since it already has reliability, stable
software (mostly), and a fanatical user base.</a></a>
