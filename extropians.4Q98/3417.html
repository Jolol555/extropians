Abstract
<br>
  Female SHR mice were fed the activated
  carbon fiber adsorbent Aqualen beginning at the age of 3
  months through their life. Mice were fed Aqualen five times per week together
  with lab chow at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg b.w. The addition of Aqualen into
  food did not significantly influence the dynamics of body weight and the mean
  life-span of the animals. At the same time, the age at 90% mortality of mice
  was 4 months longer in the group exposed to Aqualen. There were no
  statistically significant differences in the incidence of all tumors and
  malignant tumors in the group of mice treated with Aqualen as compared with
  the control group. However, in the group of mice exposed to Aqualen, there
  was a 1.4 times reduction of the mean number of tumors per mouse. Feeding
  mice with the adsorbent led to a 4 months longer life-span in animals with
  any tumors and to a 5 months longer life-span in animals bearing malignant
  tumors (P &lt; 0.05). No carcinogenic effect of Aqualen was found. It could be
  supposed that Aqualen has some geroprotective and anticarcinogenic
  properties.
