<a name="0762qlink1">Here's a potentially better protocol:

<p>
First the entity must ask itself, what am I trying to accomplish, what am I
trying to become, what is my goal? Setting a goal is essential to actually
getting anywhere.</a>

<p>
<a name="0762qlink2">Then the entity sets up a worldspace in which the entity populates</a> with several
<a name="0762qlink3">copies of itself, which can interact, combine, reproduce by both</a> asexual budding
<a name="0762qlink4">and bisexual intercourse, as well as being able to edit themselves and each
other on a limited basis.</a>

<p>
<a name="0762qlink5">Entity copies within the worldspace  can grow over time, but if they remain
static they die after a given amount of time. Those that lose various
competetive rankings more often than not die sooner rather than later.</a> These
<a name="0762qlink6">competetive rankings are based loosely on the goals the Entity Prime</a> wishes to
<a name="0762qlink7">attain. Over time, the entities in the world space evolve toward</a> the goals of
<a name="0762qlink8">the Entity Prime, to the point that those entities which attain</a> the goals of the
<a name="0762qlink9">Entity Prime can exit the world space. At this time, the Entity Prime can
overwrite itself with Entity(n).
