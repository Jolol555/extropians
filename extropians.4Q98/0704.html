<a href="0655.html#0704qlink2">&gt; This seems a complicated rule-based morality, which I can't follow very</a><br>

 This actually happened to me! My ancestors left their nice, sunny, verdant locale.

<p>
They moved northward to hang around glaciers and huddle in snow caves without
even consulting me. Now my skin is so damn sensitive I can't spend more than a
few minutes in ordinary sunlight without damaging it, let alone swing through
trees.
<br>
They didn't even leave me a note- no inscription on a rock, no phone call to say
"I'm sorry", nothing.
