Mentally retarded or otherwise incapacitated individuals are protected. Those

is not stupidity.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In what way do these States sponsor Nestlé local distribution?</i><br>

<p>
Because these countries are all very command oriented, so Nestle could not have
distributed the product without the blessing of  the powers that be. Those
governments had the responsibility, and fudged it. Don't blame Nestle for the
poor government oversight in those countries.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3106.html#3130qlink3">&gt; Where do these "poor" States get the money to invest in such practices?</a><br>

<p>
There is plenty of money that is fed to these countries as 'aid'. That they
choose to siphon it off to line their pockets rather than serve their people is
not our concern.

<p>
<a href="3106.html#3130qlink4">&gt; |Now, I do fault Nestle for not doing something about those problems if it</a><br>

<i>&gt; |scare private companies from doing as much charitable work as they do, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; |that more responsibility will land on government organizations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting conspiracy theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I find it more probable that these "liberals" simply follow their ideology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; People in the U.S.A. might consider that ideology a conspiracy, however,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the whole political scene in the U.S.A. being more rightwing than e.g.</i><br>
<i>&gt; the European.</i><br>

<p>
Really, then why are the liberals not foaming at the mouth about how the
government's stupid policies in SE asia which exacerbated the crash down there?
For the same reason feminists blithley ignore Clintons workplace harassment of
Paula Jones but charge with tar and feathers after any private industry
executive who does the same. Its pragmatic politics, not principle that is
acting here.
