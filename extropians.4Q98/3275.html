          The Politically Correct Twelve Days of Christmas... 

          On the 12th day of the Eurocentrically imposed midwinter
          festival, my Potential-acquaintance-abuse-survivor gave to
          me, 

          TWELVE males reclaiming their inner warrior through ritual
          drumming. 

          ELEVEN pipers piping (plus the 18-member pit orchestra
          made up of members in good standing of The Musicians
          Equity Union as called for in their union contract even though
          they will not be asked to play a note...) 

          TEN melanin-deprived testosterone-poisoned scions of the
          patriarchal ruling class system leaping, 

          NINE persons engaged in rhythmic self-expression, 
          EIGHT economically disadvantaged female persons stealing
          milk-products from enslaved Bovine Americans 

          SEVEN endangered swans swimming on federally protected
          wetlands 

          SIX enslaved fowl-Americans producing stolen non-human
          animal products.
 
          FIVE golden symbols of culturally sanctioned enforced
          domestic incarceration (NOTE: after a member of the Animal
          Liberation Front threatened to throw red paint at my
          computer, the calling birds, French hens, and partridge have
          been reintroduced to their native habitat. To avoid further
          animal-American enslavement, the remaining gift package has
          been revised.) 

          FOUR hours of recorded whale songs, 
          THREE deconstructionist poets, 

          TWO Sierra Club calendars printed on recycled processed tree
          carcasses, and 

          A Spotted Owl activist chained to an old-growth pear tree.
