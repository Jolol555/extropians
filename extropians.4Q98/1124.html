Previously written: "eg there are hard core libertarians who want
immediate separation of school and state even to the point ofopposing
a voucher system. This, I think, is impractical."

<p>
In what way is it impractical?  Vouchers simply justify the
government's theft of our money.  We should immediatley eliminate any
government spending in education and reduce taxes - possibly selling
off all government education related resources and refunding the money
to tax payers.

<p>
Government sponsored education usually costs quite a bit more per
student than private education does - mainly because of administrative
overhead.  If we give vouchers that equal the average cost of a public
education student, that will upset the market for private schools
causing them to raise tuitions.  This will screw that sector of the
free market all to hell.

<p>
Why pay twice for something you could pay once with no bureaucratic
skimming?
