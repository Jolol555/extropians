&gt;&gt; &gt;Even a machine with just one setting, pleasure, would be

&gt;&gt; &gt;dreamsare made of. Now of course follows the inevitable 
&gt;&gt; &gt;question: why hasn't this been done yet? Do only implants 
&gt;&gt; &gt;have this effect (even then there would be many possible 
&gt;&gt; &gt;applications), or are the results too varied to create a 
&gt;&gt; &gt;viable product around the concept of "outside" (microwave 
&gt;&gt; &gt;etc.) brain stimulation?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   IAN: There is an external electrical mind control
&gt;&gt;   technology on the market. Unlike the flashing light 
&gt;&gt;   and sound machines, it delivers an electric impulse
&gt;&gt;   via clips placed on the ear lobes, and by that means 
&gt;&gt;   "entrains" the brain to follow the impulse frequency,
&gt;&gt;   and the general aim is to induce deep relaxation.

<a href="0418.html#0426qlink1">&gt; Certainly a step in the right direction, but IMO still way</a><br>
<i>&gt; below the technology's true potential. Imagine a machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you just put on your head (I'm not sure how big the</i><br>
<i>&gt; total device would have to be, and how much energy it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would need etc., but even a static version would have great </i><br>
<i>&gt; marketing potential) that gives you instant, safe pleasure</i><br>
<i>&gt; like you've never felt before. Resistance is futile -- you will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be pleasured, guaranteed. The ultimate form of entertainment;</i><br>
<i>&gt; you could look at a grey wall and still be amused (but to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make the experience more natural one could watch a</i><br>
<i>&gt; movie or listen to music for example). This kind of stuff</i><br>
<i>&gt; was so far only possible with dangerous (often illegal)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and unreliable chemicals. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And this is just the pure hedonism part; other settings could</i><br>
<i>&gt; for example help you to achieve "deep thoughtful concentration" </i><br>
<i>&gt; (great for work and study) or "super relaxation" (great against</i><br>
<i>&gt; all kinds of stress). How about using a relaxing or pleasure</i><br>
<i>&gt; setting during operations, or to relieve any kind of chronic</i><br>
<i>&gt; or acute pain. There is a world of possible applications out there</i><br>
<i>&gt; right for the taking. If there ever was a product that's virtually</i><br>
<i>&gt; guaranteed to sell then this must be it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, can anyone tell me: why on earth isn't this product on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the market yet? Are there technical problems, or is everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; just missing a great opportunity here? I mean, one could get</i><br>
<i>&gt; richer than Bill Gates by making a product that will virtually sell </i><br>
<i>&gt; *itself*, and no doubt will change society quite a bit in the process.</i><br>

a year, due to "deep ethical implications", or other equally vague phrases.</a>
