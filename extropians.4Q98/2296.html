Perhaps education isn't all that it is cracked up to be.  A 150 years ago, wealth people who could
afford doctors didn't do any better than poor people who didn't.  Then the medical profession
started testing treatments empirically, and they stopped using harmful treatments, and things slowly
got better.

I would guess that education is at the same point the medical profession was at 150 years ago.  I
certainly know my fair share of over educated fools.
