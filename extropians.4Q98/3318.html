<i>&gt;I don't get the point of your response, Samael. Why do you refer to a</i><br>

<a name="3396qlink2"><a name="3342qlink3">(at least some of the time).  They are happy (ish) with their
representatives.  While it is not a true PPA, it is acting as if it thinks
it is (governments frequently refer to themselves as servants of the

it's area (although I've seen it claimed elsewhere here that PPA's would
have to have a monopoly on the area they cover) and is 'out of control'.</a>

something you ought to be able to cope with.  So why aren't you?
