<p>
Watching some of the news coverage of the Discovery mission, I was
particularly drawn to the interviews with little schoolkids.  Many of them
expressed an interest in someday going into space themselves, but they also
expressed their feelings about the launch of John Glenn into orbit through a
filter of fear.  It suddenly struck me, many of these children have a first
memory of the space program that involved seeing a teacher get blown to
bits.  Our generation, most of us have positive early memories of seeing
exciting new achievements in space, the overcoming of danger, brave men and
women facing new frontiers.<a name="0727qlink1">  My own first recorded memory is one of standing
in front of the television, watching the first steps on the moon.</a>  

<p>
<a name="0754qlink1">I would be curious to know whether anyone sees little trickortreaters
dressed as astronauts this year.  On halloween, children dress as their
fantasies, or as their fears.  I haven't seen robots or astronauts in many
years.

<p>
Wishing you a happy and treat-laden eve,

<p>
