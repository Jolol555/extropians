<a name="1534qlink1">        Whoa there.  Your post was great until this point.  As you say, the
two identical twins are indeed *two different humans* with the same genetic
makeup.  However, as soon as awareness (in any capacity) occurs, the
cognitive processes become --as John Clark said in his initial post--
slightly different than each other.  Therefore, to kill one would mean
killing a being that is not *identical* to the other.  However, the level
of consciousness of each twin *would* be almost identical to each other and
would ultimately mean killing a being that is conscious.  So truly, the
question of ethics surpasses the genetic feasibility...it becomes a
question of killing something that is conscious.  True, the level of
consciousness of a newborn (or two...four is right out!) would be nowhere
near as complex as a mature human, but it would be conscious nonetheless.
So the next question is this: how developed must the consciousness be
before the killing would be considered murder?</a>
