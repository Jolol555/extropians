Good for him, but that's not what his press release says on this website:

<p>
"I'm the only gubernatorial candidate with the courage to admit that our
wars against drugs and prostitution have failed....I was misquoted
Wednesday. When asked if I supported legalized prostitution and drugs, the
first two words I said were: 'absolutely not.' "

<p>
I don't know what his take on prostitution is, but with regard to drugs it
appears he wants to minimize jail terms (or avoid them all together) and
work on educating people about the health issues related to drug use: both
excellent goals, but hardly legalization.

<p>
best, patrick
