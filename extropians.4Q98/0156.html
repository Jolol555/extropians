I have to weigh in here.

<p>
Even those with mild levels of depression experience lower levels
of self-efficacy.  They tend to underestimate their capacity for problem
solving in the future as well as their past performance. Their problem
solving abilities are rarely superior to those who are not depressed.
More severe levels of depression have been shown to actually disrupt
and distort normal cognitive processes, sapping mental energy.  I'm
surprised Spike had the energy to "deeply investigate" her fundamentalist
background (glad ya did tho).  Deeply depressed people don't really
want to do much of anything.  As for Mary Therise Gleason, if you
have gone from feeling depressed to feeling nothing, then it's possible
you have nor fully recovered.

Best wishes,
