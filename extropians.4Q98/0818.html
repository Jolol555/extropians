<p>
6:00 - 7:30 p.m.		Pass The Ice Bucket!  Join us for a cryonics meeting and

favorite delicious dishes. Parking is adjacent to our townhouse and we will
have signs up guiding you here.

And, for those of you who would rather expand your brain than your belly,
we have books from some of our favorite authors.

<p>
While others may be a little behind the times in giving thanks for the
harvest; we cryonicsts are giving thanks for the technologies that may help
us to live healthfully and indefinitely.

I welcome all to attend my home in Los Angeles or other Co-Hosted
CryoFeasts honoring Alcor Life Extension Foundation.
