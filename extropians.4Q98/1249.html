<a name="1292qlink1"><a name="1274qlink1">I find this thread fun, but it seems to me that sweeping conclusions are
being made on very little data.  I seriously doubt that most</a> extropians
<a name="1274qlink2">are first-born, nor that any one particular Kiersey temperament sort</a> is
<a name="1274qlink3">drawn to transhumanist memes.  If anything, I expected to find the more
adventurous minds drawn to it, rather than the more rational.  The
</a>
<a name="1292qlink2">sample size is dreadfully small considering the full data set, not</a> to
<a name="1274qlink4">mention the new groups of people that will be attracted to this in the
next few years.  I also see a slant due to the fact that you are
conducting the research on an internet list that has gone through
several membership fluctuations and that probably does not fully 
represent the membership of ExI at this time.</a>
