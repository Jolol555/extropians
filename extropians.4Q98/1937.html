<p>
The police state recruits (not entirely, but to a large extent) from the
ranks of formerly abused children. (The psychological profile of a cop, and
that of a crook look surprisingly identical.) Consequently, to starve the
police state and take away its fuel, decrease the number of children who get
abused, so that they won't grow up to become agents of the police state.
Don't use the current police state to try to reduce child abuse. Use
community action, education, networking with other parents, counseling, and
every method available to private citizens, to prevent child abuse.

OIC...

<p>
Healthy, happy middle class police states?  That doesn't seem very extropian
somehow.
<br>
Extropian police states, although conceivably healthy and happy, would
experience difficulty escaping the black holes of their self-contradicton.
Despite this, they might elicit a soft chuckle from the mists that lie heavy
over the tomb of Neitzsche. Do I alone view extropy as the opposite of
police statism? -zen

<p>
PS: I had never before considered police states capable of health and
happiness. Bee hives and ant colonies had always seemed repulsive to me when
used as paradigms or analogies for human social organization. When the hive
mind promises euphoric wellness, I in turn measure that against peak
experience moments of my own manufacture. Life ordered by committees
stagnates by boring citizens to death in never ending meetings. Conclusion:
The most insidious abuse of children surely involves persuading them to
prefer security over spontaneity. In contrast, transhuman values prevail by
enabling people to attain their full creative potential.
