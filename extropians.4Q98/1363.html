Hi all,

<p>

<a href="1340.html#1363qlink1">&gt;Ever since reading Vernor Vinge's "True Names" I've thought a distributed</a><br>
<i>&gt;artificial intelligence would be one of the neatest things one could do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with distributed computing (the "Mailman" from the aforementioned story</i><br>
<i>&gt;was a distributed AI that got its name because it answered questions </i><br>
<i>&gt;slowly, as if by post).</i><br>

<p>
Great book. The mail man reminds me of a computer implemented out of 
people passing notes to each other instead of transistors passing 
voltage. This in turn reminded me of  what is called "Turing 
Functionalism" This is the position that a Turing machine (however 
implemented) would be conscious if it ran the consciousness program. One 
envisages the paper tape program ticking over for millenia and then 
someone cuts it: was the machine half conscious, never conscious?

<p>
<a name="1384qlink1">I asked Daniel Dennett if he was a Turing functionalist: he said yes and 
no ;-)

<p>
I think he said yes, but that interaction is critical, he views 
intelligence as being embedded in the machines environment as well as in 
its own hardware. For this reason he doubted that a paper tape Turing 
machine could be conscious as the environmental context on which 
consciousness is scaffolded (in his, but not my) view, would be invisible 
to it: a kind of Nyquist limit for implementation speeds.</a>

<p>
best,
