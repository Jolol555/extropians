<p>
In Reference to an earlier thread.

<p>
 o   According to "Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy," 
<pre>
       published annually by the Capital Research Center, 
       companies donate three times as much to liberal, pro-
       government organizations as to conservative, pro-market 
       public affairs groups.

</pre>
<p>
and oddly.

<p>
o   ............., Boeing is eliminating 48,000 jobs this year 
<pre>
       and chalked up a $178 million loss last year -- yet it 
       gave away $51.3 million in 1997.

</pre>
<p>
One  conclusion I draw from this is that liberals are really good at begging.
And possibly....


<p>
"Some analysts wise to the ways of corporate philanthropy contend 
that what's good for a corporate chief who seeks plaudits for 
social responsibility isn't necessarily good for his 
shareholders."

Cantoni (Capstone Consulting Group), "An Uncharitable Look at 
Corporate Philanthropy," Wall Street Journal, December 22. 1998.


<p>
Oddly enough I would think that the corporate officers should have the best
interests of the corporation in mind.  to spend corporate monies in such a way
as to impede the business is contraproductive?  Perhaps even suicidal?

<p>
o   PNC Bank gave $97,000 to ACORN -- an activist group that 
<pre>
       lobbies for higher taxes and stricter enforcement of 
       banking regulations.


</pre>
<p>
Crazy...
