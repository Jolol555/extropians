<a href="1854.html#1905qlink2">&gt; Funny enough I cannot remember a single tv-show that has had any kind of</a><br>
<i>&gt; lasting impact on me. Can any of you?</i><br>

<p>
One of the most interesting things I ever saw was a documentary on
the Discovery Channel called "The Living Dead" (or something like that)
about cryonics. I saw it, and instantly became enlightened ;-)
 
<p>
<a href="1854.html#1905qlink3">&gt; Maybe tv isn't a good media for spreading futuristic positive memes at all,</a><br>
<i>&gt; or is that simply because I havn't seen the right shows?</i><br>

<p>
On the contrary, I think that shows like Star Trek have brought more
or less "positive" futuristic memes to a broader audience than any
book has. Of course Star Trek isn't exactly transhumanistic, but 
apparently most people see it as a "positive" future vision, which is
good enough. Also, the Discovery Channel is doing a great job
by featuring cryonics, life extension and other transhuman topics 
more often than any other channel I know.
