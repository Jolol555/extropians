<p>
Incidentally, after producing a rather speculative post along the lines of
"Dunno, but I hope so", I should like to remind everyone why I hope so:

<p>
There's an infinite set of possible choices.
If all choices are equally right, why do you get up in the morning?
In short, "objective morality" is the *correct* choice.

<p>
If there's no distinction between a "correct" moral system and an "incorrect"
moral system, no way of singling out the best, if they're all
indistinguishable from each other - well, why do you make any choice at all? 
I acknowledge this possibility, but I also acknowledge that there may be a
method of distinguishing between choices, and it's the second possibility that
yields meaningful guidance.

<p>
Don't tell me that the "correct" choice depends what system you're in.  The
system *is* the set of correct-to-the-system choices; that's the *definition*
of "system".  Which *system* is "correct"?  If all the systems are
indistinguishable, why not choose the system where I jump off a building? 
Again, I act on the assumption that systems are distinguishable, because the
alternative doesn't yield meaningful directions.

<a name="2109qlink1">You have some people who say, "The choices are all the same; I'll do what
seems best to me."  At a higher level of self-awareness, you have:  "I'll
stick with the evolutionary system I was born in, they're all the same."</a>  At a
<a name="2109qlink2">higher level of self-awareness, you say:  "Which new system</a> you choose depends
<a name="2109qlink3">on how your current system evaluates that choice."  Choices, systems,
trajectories... but I want to jump out of the system and choose</a> the real answer.
