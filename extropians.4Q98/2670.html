<p>
Yes, I understand.

<p>
On the subject of intelligence and IQ, I suppose that I'm an "odd woman
out" here because I think qualities of high intelligence and brilliance
often pass by unnoticed because those who enjoy writing about it and
postulating about it are in search of criteria that can be limiting.
Because in my field, IQ testing is secondary to creative insight or
innovation, I have placed little emphasis on IQ and still gasp at the
academic emphasis to such testings.  Yet, I realize the necessity of
testing and why it is useful.  However, recently one of my brothers
comments that we have more geniuses in our family when he was told the IQs
of his two very young daughters, I bit my tongue.  What types of testing,
by whom, for what purposes, and by whose standards?  There is a difference
between a bright child and truly gifted prodigy.  

<p>
Recently, I had a conversation with some friends over dinner about
intelligence vs. wisdom.  Those who considered themselves intelligent, were
pedantic about their definition of wisdom.  They assumed that wisdom could
be achieved without intelligence, as if to protect their own intelligence,
just in case someone who they considered not to be up to snuff (by their
standards of mental acumen) was not better than them.  I found this to be
off putting and lacking insight and humility.

<p>
Again, I suppose this is why I had previously mentioned in a post the
Scientific America issue on "Intelligence" -- the many aspects of
intelligence and perceptions of same.

<p>
In the article "A Multiplicity of Intelligences" by Howard Gardner, he
lists nine kinds of intelligences (and they are not gender-specific -:).  I
rather like this, and feel more comfortable with this concept.

<p>
Here, he lists one such intelligence as "Personal Intelligence" which I
find to be important to our extropian transhuman goals.  "Accurately
determining moods, feelings and other metal states in oneself
(interpersonal intelligence) and in others (interpersonal) and using the
information as a guide for behavior."

<p>
Perhaps at this stage in our self-evolution, we might consider excelling in
this type of intelligence because it will come in handy.  It is such a
pleasant treat to be with someone who actually is in touch with himself and
others.  Max and I discussed this yesterday after I expressed my
frustration with a lot of rudeness that I notice around with not only
drivers on freeways, but also manners and indifference of people.  He
brought up a concept in Neil Stephenson's _The Diamond Age_ where there is
a "neo-Victorian" quality of manners and grace in a radically redefined
sense of reality.
