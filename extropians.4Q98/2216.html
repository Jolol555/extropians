<p>
Okay, substitute "Beverly Hills" or "Martha's Vineyard" for "the Bahamas".
Does that help?

<p>
No? All right... if someone has what it takes to move to one of the places
named, then they already have a robust knowledge base. People who don't know
any better (lack education), will not think about leaving Somalia, Ethiopia,
or their third world desert in favor of paradisiacal digs.

<p>
People don't move to the Bahamas to get an education. They go there to enjoy
the lifestyle of rich and famous residents. To a perhaps lesser extent,
people move to the US to enjoy the freedom and prosperity, not to live as
starving students.

<p>
Then again, maybe, your words, "I'm clearly not educated enough to
understand it" apply more accurately to me than to you. I don't live in any
of those swanky places. :-(
