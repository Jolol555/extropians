It's been a while since I had the luxury of sitting down to write, 
but here goes:

<p>
The death penalty is indeed a proper solution to the problem of those 
persons who have shown themselves to be dangerous to others and 
incapable of being salvaged. In the future, we may have the means of 
repairing the mental problems of these individuals, but for now, I 
believe it is kinder to put them down as one would a vicious animal, 
without suffering.

<p>
The biggest problem I have with our present system is that the 
penalty is applied more as a method of earning political brownie 
points for prosecutors than as either a deterrent or as justice. 
Witness the many persons released from Death Row in the recent past, 
and the present situations in Illinois where more than a few times 
sentences have been overturned based on flawed prosecutions or missed 
evidence.

<p>
Here, some of our lawmakers have come out against a proposed 
moratorium on executions, sayiong that 'it's too bad if an innocent 
dies, but we have to act tough'. 

<p>
Until the justice system can make absolutely certain decisions of 
guilt and motivation, I would advocate eliminating the death penalty.
