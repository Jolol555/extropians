agnostics are to the left of the lefty religions such as universalist/
unitarians.  if you scan the literature of these lefty groups, they really
dont believe much of anything.  {8^D  by your description of
yourself, you and i are pretty much agreed with respect to religious
beliefs, but probably arrived at the same point via different routes.
i confess to having started at the far right (fundamentalist) and
moved to the right from there.

<p>
one aspect i still share with fundy religionists is that we are
both, well... sure of ourselves, sure of our current positions,
and consequently in danger of being closed minded.  im not
pointing fingers, for i know that three point back at me... {8^D

<p>
<a href="3317.html#3363qlink2">&gt; I certainly don't consider myself right of the fundamentalists...</a><br>

<p>
agnostic would be to the right of the athiest.  athiest to the
right of the fundamentalist.

<i>&gt;  I think that honest atheists, those who come to thinking that way out</i><br>

<p>
perhaps.  these analogies break down if you push them too hard,
but they do offer some insight methinks.  spike
