there are a lot of different mental conditions that are grouped together
under the name clinical depression.  seems to me it can be either
positive or negative.   i decided, during a case of clinical depression
at age 20, to deeply investigate my fundamentalist christian belief
system.  this lasted for a number of months, at the end of which
i decided the system was false, and all religion is essentially false,
that science was way, the path to truth and enlightenment.

tho excruciating at the time, that "depression" was a positive thing,
for comfortable people do not wish anything in their lives to change.  spike
