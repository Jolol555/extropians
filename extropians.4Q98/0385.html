The distinction you have drawn out here is between creating an upload
world suitable for migration, and living in an already created upload
world that you and all of your ancestors have evolved in.  It is the
latter, not the former, that I cannot prove is not the case.  In my
mind, not being able to disprove the latter disqualifies a lot of
commonly assumed limitations about the former.  Anyway, none of your
objections are directly applicable to the use of this argument. 
Indirectly, however, if everyone was aware of the lack of limitations
implicit in this argument, that should alleviate some discomfort.....
I would hope.  On the other hand, the lack of limitations in an upload
world actually are far greater than this argument takes you.  Those
extra unknowns will certainly add discomfort but thats just part of
life in the singularity lane.

<a href="0375.html#0385qlink3">&gt; reality all that gets thrown out, and you have to use very different </a><br>
<i>&gt; and alien approaches to evaluate and preserve your security.  That by </i><br>
<i>&gt; itself is enough to make someone uncomfortable with such a life. </i><br>

<p>
There are going to be some uncomfortable transitions for sure.  What I
call "my ideal scenario for uploading" is nothing more than
"theoretically possible".  That scenario allows for uploading into a
world where, at first glance, you are unable to detect you have been
uploaded.  Odd that you mention security as being a deterrent.  I've
always thought that that would be what pushes me to upload before the
technology has matured to a point where I could migrate comfortably. 
Having multiple backup copies for survival of disaster sounds a lot
more secure to me than defending a spot of property that can be blown
to shreds.
