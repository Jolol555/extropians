<p>
I was in a library today and i've just bought :
*
<br>
*Enquete d'immortalité de MARTINO B.
<br>
Voyages dans le futur de Nicolas Pantzo, au Seuil
L'Homme Neuronal de JP Changeux




<p>
During my trip in the library i've noticed the existence of a spanish book
called "El Aleph" but I can't remember the name of the author and i understand
nothing in spanish anyway... Anders ;)?
<br>
I've never understood where the Word "Aleph" comes from...
But if it is needed i can easily go back to the library (a few hundred meters
of my flat) and can even buy the book (should not be expensive at all)...


<p>
I've just looked at the comments about Zen and the Brain on Amazon.com to know
what is it about...
<br>
And well...I'm rather tempted ;)
<br>
Do you think it's worth to buy for somebody with absolutely no background in
neuroscience ?
<br>
I should add that my brain is more trained at things like mathematics and I
feel that neuroscience could be a very difficult subject to grasp for me,
having a *very* poor memory (I think)
<br>
Stardrive9 ;) ? Anders ?
