<p>
When "society" proposes to classify transhumanists and extropians as
"violent criminals" then we'll need protection from "society."

<p>
I think the world needs criminal corpsicles about as much as it needs to
collide with a giant asteroid. "Where society outlaws cryogenics, only
outlaws will get frozen."  --Elmer Fudd

<p>
<a href="1694.html#1778qlink3">&gt;the deterrent value of such a penalty is unclear.  ideas?  this proposal</a><br>
<i>&gt;would provide a number of corpsicles that were perfectly healthy and</i><br>

<p>
Idea: Find the cause of criminality, and fix it. (Oh, sorry, I had convinced
<a name="1788qlink1">myself that science and technology could do practical things as well</a> as spin
<a name="1788qlink2">off more computer games and Borg movies.)</a> But just think, if some savvy
transhuman network actually determined the cause of criminality and fixed
it, suddenly the "death penalty" would join the "scarlet letter" in the
dustbin of irrelevance.

<p>
Cheers,
