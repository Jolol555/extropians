  I can form habits, regardless of wether the habits are dancing, yoga, 
studying, or partying, and I know it works on these things from 
experience.
<br>
When you start doing that which you want to do more often, take a few 
deep inhalations and exhalations, drink lot's of water, and when you 
have reached you goal, eat huge steaks cooked at low temperatures 
(unless you are a vegan of blood type A), and take a multivitamin.
The main substance we want is L-tyrosine, the amino-acid precurser of 
the natural neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinepherine, which is 
found in meat.
<br>
Dopamine is our friend.
<br>
When ravers take the drug "ecstasy", they experience the profound sense 
of love caused by our friend dopamine when he is overactive.
In effect, you can fall mildly in love with whatever you choose to do 
when eating L-tyrosine.

<a name="0816qlink1">It's sold at General Nutrition Centers under the label of a bodybuilding 
suppliment called Neurogain by EAS (Experimental and Applied Sciences) 
for use as a strength, endurance, motivation, and energy enhancer.</a>
<a name="0816qlink2">Oh yea, all you ladies will be absolutely ecstatic to know that while I 
am on Neurogain, fat drops off me like there is no tommorrow, even when 
I try to prevent</a> it.
<br>
<a name="0816qlink3">...but BE CAREFULL, it's very potent!
<br>
I lost my virginity because of this.
<br>
I'm almost a nympho now.
<br>
God, I love this. :-)
