Interesting.

<p>
That echo's a concept I've been developing for quiet some time.   I'm agin
government schools.  I think that children should be homeschooled.</a>  When asked
<a name="2309qlink2">how those homeschooled children are going to learn social skills by
interacting with their "peers" I point out that it's irrelevant.</a>

<p>
<a name="2309qlink3">By that I mean.....why teach  children to interact with children?</a>  Childhood
<a name="2309qlink4">is a temporary thing...the remainder of their lives they will</a> be dealing with
<a name="2309qlink5">adults.  Why not teach children to deal with adults to begin</a> with and be done
with it?

<p>
<a name="2309qlink6">Yes...I know...look at all the things they would miss by not</a> interacting with
<a name="2309qlink7">their peers.....like drugs...bullies...teenage pregnancy...and other such
character building experiences..</a>
