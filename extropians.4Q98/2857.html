The problem is that many people can't/won't be professional soldiers,
and in a world full of (potential) enemies you really need more than
just a bunch of guys with AKs; you need trained personnel that can
fly helicopters, fire missiles, operate tanks, knows about demolition,
surveillance techniques, counter-intelligence etc, etc. This means</a> that 
you have to form a standing army with (probably) mercenaries, as
was often done troughout history. People's militias can be a good 
addition to a professional army, but are not sufficient to defend your 
territory against a serious attack in this day and age.

<p>
There is one alternative tactic, of course: stockpile weapons of
mass destruction and threaten to use them against anyone who
attacks. This *does* severely limit your tactical possibilities, of
course...
