<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; No No No. You missed the most important difference. In the first</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the 'producers' as a common group. This is the essential incompatibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; of libertarianism and socialism. Libertarianism declares that the prime</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; political unit is the individual, while socialism declares that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; primary political unity is the community or society, thus letting in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; buggaboo of coersion of the individual by the tyranny of the masses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Can you give net refs as to how this Libertarianism doublethink came</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about where the word *political* (i.e. I think of it as describing an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;aspect of people's connections) came to focus on a node within the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;connections rather than the collective. If I were to use an analogy, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;concepts of a jukebox, genre, playlist or database springs to mind as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;words on one end of the scale where the adjective *political* would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reside and words like individual, song or field appear at the other end.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Thus to me a song isn't a set and an individual isn't his connections.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;My PC isn't a primary internet unit because before I used the internet</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;my PC did other things. I know there are differences between adjectives</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and nouns and that confusion between the two can lead to delusional</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thinking, but even though I also know the Nazis were deluded in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thinking about race, etc., this plural/singular (i.e.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;political/individual) definition mix up that you point to has me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;perplexed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0689qlink1"><a name="0679qlink1"><i>&gt;   IAN: A libertarian society is a society in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a set of collective rules (political power) exist</i><br>
<i>&gt;   that define the rights of individuals.  Robinson</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Crusoe has no political rights, and the example</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of your computer free from the net is Crusoe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   So there's no contradiction between the concepts of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   political rights, the individual, and libertarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The individual in society has political rights, more</i><br>
<i>&gt;   or less, but Robinson Crusoe has no polical rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Crusoe is still an individual and your earlier statement that the basic
political unit in your definition of Libertarianism is the individual. I
contradict this. Sure the basic political unit may reside in the
<a name="0679qlink2">individual but isn't the individual. The individual may be a type of
</a>
political unit but hardly *the* basic one. I would be happy to accept
that another basic political unit maybe an abstract conflict of some
sort. I don't say all conflicts because right now I'm installing a
</a>
network and have irq conflicts; - unless you accept that my relationship
with the net is political.
