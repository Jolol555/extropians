  <li>  if you can't remove yourself from this system to a different system that
offers the type of government you want then it is coercion.
  <li>  if you have no choice as to your particular grab bag of services you want,
then you are being coerced.
  <li>  even if you gain something from the no choice transaction, it is still theft,
since you had no choice to buy it or not. If someone else who wasn't an IRS
employee did that to you here, they would face RICO charges and spend a long
time in jail. Why is the government exempt from its own laws? The concept of
Equal Justice Under the Law is false when a government isn't subject to its own
laws, and is nothing but tyranny.
  <li>  try do the same transaction in reverse. Give the government somthing and try
to force them to pay for it. If you can't do it then it is theft. A fair
economic transaction is one where either party is comfortable to be on either
side of the transaction. Anything less is theft.
