The phrase, "widespread violent chaos followed by totally
new forms of
<br>
government" could accurately describe the last several
hundred years of
<br>
human history. An incomprehensibly complex evolutionary
development (such as
<br>
the Singularity) may either reverse or accelerate this
trend.

<p>
The form of power most strengthened by a totally reliable
truth machine
<br>
would naturally lead to the Singularity, since a true
Singularity would have
<br>
only peripheral use for lesser powers. Once the Truth
Machine Agency seizes
<br>
control of human destiny, it declares Judgment Day, and
everyone gets to
<br>
testify. Like term limits, but you only get fifteen seconds.
