Yes I agree, Buddhism does not tie neatly into Extropianism, rather I said it
<a name="0067qlink2">the most Extropian of the established religions.</a>  As for reincarnation, many,
esp in Zen, are agnostic.  One master when asked "What happens after you
die?", answered, "How would I know, I am not dead !".  Yes, life is suffering,
but it is not grim, for with dilligence, one can transcend it.  Regardless of
the possibility  of a fairy tale, the psychological /mental aspects of the
Buddhist practice is a powerful example of conscious(ness) development.
Buddha asked that the methods not be taken on faith, but be tried with a
critical and  emprical attitude.

<p>
Hence, Extropianism, being eclectic, draws the best ideas and methods from all
sources.  Not just the Zen, but Pirsig's ideas on Quality also.
