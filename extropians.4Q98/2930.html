I'll take this one. What you don't know about the recovery effort</a> is that the
overwhelming majority of assistance is NOT from other governments, but from
private corporations, mainly in the US, and from private citizens. I personally
know three people who just got on a plane and went down there to volunteer in
hospitals, and all of their freinds up here are putting together large support
packages. Another freind of mine just got back from Africa where he was doing
hospital work for several weeks (he's an anasthesiologist). Whenever there is a
disaster here in the US, outside of government payouts to businesses and private
insurance payouts, the relief support is almost entirely funded by private groups
and businesses. Several home manufacturers have donated literally thousands of
manufactured homes to various hurricane victims in the South.

<p>
You really need to do your research before you spout off like that.
