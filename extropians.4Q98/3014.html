<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What exactly is the difference between a local gov't and a local PPF?</i><br>

<p>
Up until the civil war, and usually thereafter up until this century the US
government was a nascent PPF federation of monopoly PPA's (i.e. the states).
Government was kept to a bare minimum. You will recall that at the time of the
Bonus Army demonstrations in the late 20's and early 30's the US Army was so
thinly spread across the US that MacArthur could only muster a couple of tanks
and a few hundred men. The main difference is that any PPA under a PPF will have
multiple insurance policy packages that people are free to choose among, each of
which will usually have general blanket coverage of certain things that are
common due to standard PPA policies and agreements with other PPAs, but plenty of
stuff which is optional, as is the case with car insurance in most places.
Additionally people can choose among PPAs to receive their services through, and
as much or as little coverage as they want and their PPA is willing to sell them,
and even if part of the same PPF, they will maintain brand name differentiation
because they will typically serve different market segments, much like different
car companies. A government is a one size fits all, one product that comes in any
color so long as its black, monopoly.
