<p>
If Many Worlds is correct then it's extremely common for universes to merge,
although nobody knows if it's as common as them splitting, the best example is
Young 2 slit experiment. You get an interference pattern when you fire a photon
(or an electron) at 2 slits even if you send them through one at a time, it sure
seems that something is going through both slits at the same time, but what?
Other interpretations say that it is an abstract pilot wave or probability wave,
Many Worlds is more concrete, it says it's just what it seems to be, 2 photons
interfering with each other, and this is true even if you only send one
photon. The other interpretations assume that there is only one reality
(or no reality at all), Many Worlds makes no such assumption.

<p>
<a name="2274qlink2">Let's do the two-slit experiment, but instead of using film to stop the
photons after they pass the slit, let them head out into infinite space.
If Many Worlds is correct then the entire universe splits in 2 when the
photon  hit's the 2 slits. There is nothing special about you the observer,
you split just like everything else, you know that the photon went through
one and only one slit, but of course you have no way of knowing which one.

<p>
Now let's do the more usual two-split experiment and put the film back in.
The universe splits just as it did before when it passed the two slits, but
when the photon hits the film and it no longer exists in either universe then
the 2 universes fuse back together again.</a> Looking back we find evidence that
<a name="2274qlink3">the photon (or electron) went through both slits and this causes an
interference  pattern. Again there is nothing special about an observer in
this, the same thing  would happen if nobody looked at the film, or even if
you used a brick wall instead of film, because the important thing is not that
the photon makes a record (whatever that is) but simply that it is destroyed.
Mind has nothing to do with any of this so I don't need to explain it, or exactly
what a measurement</a> is.

<p>
<a name="2274qlink4">Does all this violate Ockham's Razor? I'm not sure. Invoking all those
universes is not exactly simple, but is it the simplest idea that explains
what's going on? The Many Worlds interpretation is cheap on assumptions
but expensive on universes.</a>
