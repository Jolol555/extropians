<a href="1713.html#1718qlink1">&gt;Brian writes, in response to my characterizing capital punishment</a><br>
<i>&gt;as initiation of force  inconsistent with the non-aggression</i><br>
<i>&gt;principle:</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink2">&gt;&gt; The force was initiated by the murderer, so it is not</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;inconsistent.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink3">&gt;Force was initiated by the murderer, but since the death penalty</a><br>
<i>&gt;is not an immediate and direct response to the murderer's force,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it does not qualify as defensive counterforce. Any harm inflicted</i><br>
<i>&gt;after the fact is a *separate* application of force, and hence an</i><br>
<i>&gt;initiation. Or is there some flaw in my reasoning here?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1725qlink2">The flaw lies in the fact that I just re-read "the extropian
Principals v2.6, and there is no non-aggression principal.

<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink4">&gt;&gt; As citizens of a government we are subject to legal definitions.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink5">&gt;I disagree. Most of us haven't chosen to be "citizens" in the</a><br>
<i>&gt;first place, we are simply claimed as such by the nearest</i><br>
<i>&gt;gangsters calling themselves "government". "Subject to legal</i><br>
<i>&gt;definitions" is somewhat ambiguous, but if you mean we're somehow</i><br>
<i>&gt;("morally" or otherwise) bound to define things the way the</i><br>
<i>&gt;powers-that-be tell us to, I'd like to know why.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1725qlink5">You don't have to agree on the definition, but if you violate it,
you will be punished.</a> In a world where private agreements handle
<a name="1725qlink6">these matters you can be assured my contract will call for the
death of anyone who murders me.</a>


<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink6">&gt;In response to my objection that there's no substantive difference</a><br>
<i>&gt;between punishment and revenge:</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink7">&gt;&gt; Revenge: to inflict harm in return for an injury etc.</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Punishment: To undergo pain, loss etc as for a crime.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (source: Websters New World dictionary.)</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink8">&gt;OK, I ask again: wherein is the difference? Those definitions look</a><br>
<i>&gt;to me like alternative ways of saying the same thing.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1725qlink7">Punishment requires being convicted of a crime.</a>

<p>
<a href="1709.html#1718qlink9">&gt; No compensation or restitution is adequate or possible. Only</a><br>
<i>&gt; justice in the form of equivalent punishment.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1713.html#1718qlink10">&gt;Here you're simply assuming that justice equals punishment, or at</a><br>
<i>&gt;least implying, without support,  that punishment is just. But</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't justice in essence simply fairness? You need to _argue_ for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fairness of punishment, not just assert it in passing, and, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;a first step, you should distinguish it from mere revenge, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have so far failed to do.</i><br>

<p>
Semantic's. The only fair punishment for the illegal malicious
taking of another persons life is to forfeit yours.

<p>
<a name="1725qlink8">I argue it is fair because it is the only thing a murderer has of
equivalent value to what he/she took.</a>

<p>
<a name="1768qlink8"><a name="1725qlink9">If an individual does it it is revenge.</a></a>

<p>
If you are tried lawfully, fairly, and convicted. It will be just,
fair, punishment.
