I remember some years (6-10) ago thinking about doing things that
would mean dying: Being in unprotected shuttle that were crashing into
earth or one way trip to somewhere solar system. Then I had my Aha!
experience: If I had perfect copy in the earth it would not matter
whether I died. I could safely try deadly things. So this body would
be destroyed and I would experience 'death', but I would not really
die.

<p>
I think that it could be characterized in one sentence: Realizing in
your subconscious level that physical form really doesn't matter, it's
your thoughts ('algorithms') that matter.

<p>
&lt;/Me too&gt;
