<a name="1038qlink1"><a name="1026qlink2"><a name="1021qlink1">Really?  A desire for privacy is part of human nature?  Are there any
studies that support that hypothesis?  Do you mean to say that there</a> was
some evolutionary advantage available to those who preferred to be alone?</a>
The only survival value I can think of off the top of my head would be that
when one was alone and unmonitored, one had an opportunity to hide, or to
steal, or do something else unbeknownst to the rest of the tribe that would
give one some sort of unfair (but effective) advantage.  Any other
advantages come to mind that might have resulted in a preference for privacy
being hard-wired into our circuitry?</a>
