To answer this we need to have a more detailed model of the gnatbots
and of any countermeasures.

<a name="1417qlink1">There is a limitation to the visual acuity possible to a bug that is
literally the size of a gnat.  I believe Brin suggested that it might
need to land and inflate a lens in order to get good visual images.
This could make such bugs a lot easier to detect (depending on how big
the lens</a> is).

<p>
The gnat needs to be able to record information, or else transmit it.
If it is transmitting it probably needs considerable power to get through
walls, etc., and can be detected.  Recording is going to require extreme
compactness, depending on how much data it has to hold.  We've all seen
how even a few seconds of audiovisual data eats the megabytes.

<p>
It seems to me that a literal "gnatbot", the size of a gnat, able to
capture visual and sound imagery for several hours, then fly somewhere and
transmit it, is going to come pretty close to requiring full Drexlerian
nanotech.  I don't see it as something which is going to happen in the
near future.  We can put it safely out in the fuzzy nanotech region
of the 2020s or so.

<p>
Given Drexlerian nanotech, it would be relatively easy to maintain a
"clean room" environment where objects as small as gnats are easily
detected.  Even today's technology can do a lot better than this in
chip fabs.  If gnatbots ever become possible then we would probably see
this technology becoming widespread.  Eventually with full nanotech it
may be routine in any indoor environment.

<a href="1399.html#1416qlink2">&gt; For the fun of it, lets imagine that all of the scenarios in 'X-Files'</a><br>

<p>
Suppose they decide to test a new psychoactive chemical on the population,
a typical X-Files scenario.  Much could be accomplished by anonymous
instructions to various actors.  Various labs fabricate certain organic
chemicals, others put them together into mixtures.  A manufacturing
plant gets a contract for asthma inhalers including the new chemical.
A marketing firm is hired to distribute the inhalers for free in a medium
sized city.  Some thousands of people start acting a little wacky.

<p>
Conceivably someone could trace the chain backwards once they are alerted
to the problem, but they'd need to be experts to really figure out what is
going on.  And the shadowy figures behind the scenes are never connected
to the activities.
