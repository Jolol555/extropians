<p>
Scott: You're an atheist. Atheism = a-theism, that is, a lack of belief in
a god. (Though to be useful, we first need to specify *which* god we're
talking about.) There need be nothing dogmatic about atheism. If we're
talking about the standard idea of God (omniscient, omnipotent, and
all-good), then not only do I see no evidence for believing such a being
exists, the hypothesis seems disconfirmed by observation.

<p>
Perhaps there is a god of some kind--a designer and creator of our
universe. I am currently atheistic in regard to that view, but if the
balance of evidence shifted, I would change my mind. (See Gregory Benford's
latest novel Cosm--perhaps our universe was an accidental creation of an
other-universe scientist. Would we call that person a god?)

<p>
An agnostic is *not* simply a wimpy atheist. An agnostic is one who thinks
they either (a) do not know [weak form of agnosticism), or (b) cannot know
[strong form], whether there is a god. To decide whether you are an
agnostic, you first need to decide on a standard of knowledge.

<p>
You can be an agnostic atheist. If you don't think it's the kind of thing
you can know, and you take it that the sensible default position is lack of
belief, then you're an agnostic atheist.

<p>
You could also (more controversially) be an agnostic theist, if you believe
but do so on faith, and agree that faith is not a means of knowledge but a
way of believing.

<p>
I would say that I am an atheist but not an agnostic, at least if we're
talking about the Christian/Moslem God. I find every positive argument in
favor of belief to fail. I see evidence that conflicts strongly with the
hypothesis that such a being exists. And I have methodological reasons
(parsimony) for putting the burden of proof on believers.
