<i>&gt;M.I.T. Scientists Turn Simple Idea Into 'Perfect Mirror'</i><br>
<i>&gt;By BRUCE SCHECHTER</i><br>
<i>&gt; team of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has recently</i><br>
<i>&gt;announced what may be the most significant advance in mirror technology since</i><br>
<i>&gt;Narcissus became entranced by his image reflected on the surface of a still</i><br>
<i>&gt;pool of water. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Their invention, which they are calling the "perfect mirror" combines the best</i><br>
<i>&gt;features of the two previously known types of mirrors by reflecting light at</i><br>
<i>&gt;any angle with virtually no loss of energy. It promises to have significant</i><br>
<i>&gt;applications in many fields, including fiber optics, cellular telephones,</i><br>
<i>&gt;energy conservation, medicine, spectroscopy and even, perhaps, cake</i><br>
<i>&gt;decoration. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Using layers to make the impossible possible.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;--</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;"This is very significant," said Dr. Eli Yablonovitch, a physicist at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;University of California at Los Angeles. "There are going to be some important</i><br>
<i>&gt;applications." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The announcement by the M.I.T. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;team was initially greeted with disbelief by scientists, who for generations</i><br>
<i>&gt;had been taught that mirrors with the properties the team claimed were</i><br>
<i>&gt;impossible. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;John D. Joannopoulos, a leader of the team that invented the mirrors, had even</i><br>
<i>&gt;published a "proof" of their impossibility in his widely read textbook on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;field. "Goes to show how much I know," Dr. Joannopoulos, an M.I.T. physics</i><br>
<i>&gt;professor, said with a grin, conceding his mistake. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But the basic idea behind the mirrors is so simple, depending on no new</i><br>
<i>&gt;physical insight or mathematical theory, physicists say, that anyone who reads</i><br>
<i>&gt;the M.I.T. paper is quickly convinced of its correctness. Writing about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;discovery in Science magazine, Jon Dowling, a physicist at the National</i><br>
<i>&gt;Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;California Institute of Technology said, "Every once in a while someone comes</i><br>
<i>&gt;along with a great idea that in hindsight seems so trivial you could kick</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself for not having thought of it first." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mirrors come in two basic varieties. The most common are metallic mirrors like</i><br>
<i>&gt;those found on the walls of Versailles or on medicine cabinets. Metallic</i><br>
<i>&gt;mirrors work pretty well, but they have limitations. The most important is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that they waste energy, absorbing a small fraction of the light that falls on</i><br>
<i>&gt;them. That is because when light, which, like radio waves, is a form of</i><br>
<i>&gt;electromagnetic radiation, strikes a metallic mirror the electrons in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;metal move just as they do when a radio signal strikes an antenna. Pushing</i><br>
<i>&gt;electrons around takes energy, which dims the reflected image. So metallic</i><br>
<i>&gt;mirrors cannot be used in applications like communications and high-powered</i><br>
<i>&gt;lasers, where minimizing energy loss is important. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For applications in which energy loss is important scientists depend on a more</i><br>
<i>&gt;sophisticated device known as a dielectric mirror. A dielectric is a material</i><br>
<i>&gt;like glass or plastic, that does not conduct electricity. Narcissus was</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually enamored of his image in a crude sort of dielectric mirror, because</i><br>
<i>&gt;water is a dielectric. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But dielectrics like water or glass do not reflect light well, so practical</i><br>
<i>&gt;dielectric mirrors are made by stacking alternating thin layers of two</i><br>
<i>&gt;dielectrics. Every time light passes from one layer to the next a little bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;of it is reflected. If the thicknesses of the layers are chosen carefully</i><br>
<i>&gt;these reflected light waves combine and reinforce one another, strengthening</i><br>
<i>&gt;the intensity of the reflected light. By stacking many layers scientists can</i><br>
<i>&gt;make mirrors that are nearly perfect reflectors. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another useful property of dielectric mirrors is that they can be designed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;reflect only a small range of frequencies and let the rest pass unmolested.</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, dielectric mirrors can be designed to reflect infrared light but</i><br>
<i>&gt;transmit visible light. Because infrared light is heat, dielectric mirror</i><br>
<i>&gt;windows would insulate a room from the heat of day without impeding the view.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But there is a problem. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The main drawback is that standard dielectric mirrors, unlike metallic</i><br>
<i>&gt;mirrors, reflect only light that strikes them from a limited range of angles.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A dielectric window that blocked heat from radiating from the sidewalk might</i><br>
<i>&gt;only let in the oblique rays of the noon sun. This limitation of dielectric</i><br>
<i>&gt;mirrors has restricted their use to specialized devices like lasers in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;the light can be constrained to strike at a known angle. Until the M.I.T. team</i><br>
<i>&gt;reported its findings, scientists believed that this limitation of dielectric</i><br>
<i>&gt;constants was an inconvenient law of nature, regrettable but unavoidable. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dr. Joannopoulos said the M.I.T. team members realized by accident that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;might have overlooked something. Joshua Winn, a graduate student, was playing</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a computer model of a dielectric mirror when he noticed that it seemed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be reflecting light at a much larger angle than he had thought possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Puzzled, he turned to Shanhui Fan, a post-doctoral fellow in physics who came</i><br>
<i>&gt;up with an explanation. Satisfied, the two promptly filed it away as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;theoretical novelty and forgot it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"That's the problem with being a theorist," Dr. Joannopoulos said. "Being</i><br>
<i>&gt;theorists, we tend to think in a different way." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Meanwhile, Yoel Fink, a graduate student at M.I.T.'s Plasma Fusion Science</i><br>
<i>&gt;Center who was proficient in experiment and theory, was wrestling with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;project his lab was doing for the Defense Advanced Research Agency. Maybe, he</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought, a multilayered dielectric mirror could be made to do the trick. He</i><br>
<i>&gt;made the suggestion at a large meeting. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And the minute he did, Fink said, he saw Joannopoulos light up. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Within three months, Dr. Fink had made the first mirror, completed in</i><br>
<i>&gt;February, from nine alternating layers of polystyrene -- a plastic -- and</i><br>
<i>&gt;tellurium. Measurements confirmed what theory had predicted. The mirror</i><br>
<i>&gt;reflected infrared light equally well from all angles and as efficiently as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the best metallic mirrors. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For months the researchers lived in fear that something so obvious had to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;well-known. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"How could something about mirrors not be known?" asked Dr. Edwin L. Thomas,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the other leader of the team and an M.I.T. professor of physical science and</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"We had this feeling that sooner or later somebody's going to walk up to us,</i><br>
<i>&gt;tap us on the shoulder and say, 'Yeah, we knew this a hundred years ago.' But</i><br>
<i>&gt;apparently not." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I think there's going to be a lot of activity, with people saying, 'This is</i><br>
<i>&gt;simple! It's not hard to make,' " Dr. Thomas said. In one early application</i><br>
<i>&gt;the M.I.T. group has rolled the mirrors into spaghetti-thin tubes called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"omniguides." A beam of laser light can be guided by such tubes far more</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficiently than by fiber optics because glass fibers absorb light. And,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unlike fiber optics, the omniguides can guide light around corners. In the</i><br>
<i>&gt;operating room such omniguides could precisely guide the light of the powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt;lasers surgeons use. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even more promising is the possibility of replacing conventional fiber optics</i><br>
<i>&gt;used in communications with omniguides. The absorption of light by</i><br>
<i>&gt;conventional glass fibers means that the signal must be boosted every 20</i><br>
<i>&gt;kilometers or so. This requires amplifiers, which only work in a narrow band</i><br>
<i>&gt;of frequencies. Omniguides would carry light with far less loss of energy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning they could stretch for thousands of miles without amplifiers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Engineers would not be limited to a small band of wavelengths by the abilities</i><br>
<i>&gt;of amplifiers. "You could have a thousand times the bandwidth. That's a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;big deal," Dr. Fan said. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The M.I.T. scientists also envision coating windows with infrared reflecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;mirrors to keep heat in or out of rooms. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The mirrors could be chopped into tiny flakes and mixed with transparent paint</i><br>
<i>&gt;to allow them to be applied directly to walls or windows. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The M.I.T. mirrors could also be useful in improving thermophotovoltaic cells,</i><br>
<i>&gt;devices that trap waste heat and convert it to energy. Dr. Dowling suggested</i><br>
<i>&gt;that, because the new mirrors could be made to reflect radio waves, they could</i><br>
<i>&gt;be used to boost the performance of cellular telephones. Even the apparel</i><br>
<i>&gt;industry could benefit. "You could use this type of stuff to make fiber and</i><br>
<i>&gt;very light weight clothing to keep the heat in," Dr. Joannopoulos speculated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I think this could be really big," he said. "We're limited only by our</i><br>
<i>&gt;imaginations." For the M.I.T. team that is not a severe limitation: Dr. Fink</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggested, half seriously, that mirrors could be made of edible materials to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make reflective cake icing. "Really, what food do you know of that's highly</i><br>
<i>&gt;reflective?" </i><br>
