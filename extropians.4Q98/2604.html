<a href="2562.html#2604qlink1">&gt;An AI implemented in this fashion would exhibit what I call 'unified will'.</a><br>

<p>
This may sound a bit trite, but can it really be a conscious intelligence if
it has no ability to violate it's own ethical codes? Under this system, the
AI would have no "freedom of choice" (a concept I'm still not sure about,
but which is present-- by current widely accepted definitions-- in humans).
And if it's ability to choose is less than a human, albeit infinitely more
sophisticated in the possible outcomes, how can it possibly considered more
advanced?

<p>
Does anybody have any interesting theories on freedom of choice on a
metaphysical level? I'm a bit skeptical such a thing exists at this point.
