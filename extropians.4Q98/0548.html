In 1993 before I found the mind uploading research group, I
defined/wrote: 

<p>
Ekhumanisation  n.  an act to legalize the development of the 
sub-atomic sympathetic boolean resonance in a biological, 
optical, or digital computer so it can be interfaced into a citizen's 
legal identity.

<p>
My method for carrying out this act was to engage the politicians
directly at government level. I did this by using the woefully
<a name="0557qlink1">inadequate mental health laws to spring a trap on the unsuspecting
government. After I had accepted their pension because, using their
social constructions, they considered mind-uploading a thought</a> disorder
they jokingly agreed to provide for my needs should I manage to live a
thousand years. Not only has the joke backfired on them, the government
now considers its own disordered system's best hope of surviving as an
entity is to back me up as its cyberian envoy, complete with
international protected person status. Make no mistake however, the
public AI that I foresee in the future creates a two way Survey Society
in which there is unlikely to be a surveillance government as we have
known it.
