The holiday season is on, and I have been busy with baking and making
bifurcation diagrams, so this is a fairly short list of subjects: 


<UL>
  <li> 	Fun medicine 
  <li> 	Cognitive effects of caffeine, nicotine and oxygen



</UL>
<p>
British Medical Journal

This Christmas issue has plenty of fun (not just in fun in the
scientific sense but fun in the humorous sense too :-) papers. See
especially the study to test the validity of Benjamin Franklin's maxim
"early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and
wise." (<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/317/7174/1675">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/317/7174/1675</a>), the
study of candy consumption and longevity
<br>
(<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7174/1683">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7174/1683</a>), Xenotransmission<br>
of the socioeconomic gradient in health
<br>
(<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7174/1686">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7174/1686</a> yes, the pets of<br>
rich people live longer) and a nice section where they slaughter
sacred cows.


<p>
And as usual, some more nootropics:

<p>
The effects of a low dose of caffeine on cognitive performance
Paula J. Durlach Psychopharmacology, 140, pages 116-119 1998

<p>
Does a cup of tea affect cognitive performance? It turned out that
caffeine in 60mg doses can speed reaction time in pattern recognition,
delayed match to sample and visual search. 


<p>
The effects of black tea and other beverages on aspects of cognition
and psychomotor performance
<br>
I. Hindmarch, P. T. Quinlan, K. L. Moore and C. Parkin
Psychopharmacology (Berl) 139:3 230--238 1998

<p>
A look at whether black tea has cognition enhancing
effects. Volunteers were given black tea, coffee, caffeinated water,
decaffeinated tea and plain water on three times during a day, and the
effects were factored. Tea increased performance on the critical
flicker fusion test (a measure of how quickly the CNS can distinguish
discrete sensory data) within 10 minutes.  Caffeine, as expected,
prevented the decline in alertness during the day that otherwise
occurs but did not in itself alter the CFF threshold. Tea and coffee
had similar effects on most other measures. The results suggests that
the caffeinated drinks have effects that are independent of caffeine,
possibly due to other chemicals, stimulation of the vagus nerve and/or
classical conditioning (you know you get more alert when drinking
coffee, so you get alert even before the caffeine acts).



<p>
Influence of nicotine on simulator flight performance in non-smoker
Martin S. Mumenthaler, Joy L. Taylor, Ruth O'Hara and Jerome A. Yesavage
Psychopharmacology, 140 pp 38--41, 1998

<p>
There is some confusion over whether nicotine helps both smokers and
nonsmokers, or just smokers. In this paper nonsmokers given nicotine
chewing gum performed significantly better than nonsmokers given
placebo on a flight simulator task. The improvement was especially
noticeable on the approach to landing, which appears to require
sustained attention. One reason the effect was noticeable may be that
the participants had already been exposed to nicotine gum, so effects
of nausea had gone away; another possibility is that the effect
becomes noticeable only for more taxing tasks involving many systems
rather than the usual simple tasks in psychophramacological
experiments.


<p>
Transdermal nicotine effects on attention 
E. D. Levin, C. K. Conners, D. Silva, S. C. Hinton, W. H. Meck,
J. March and J. E. Rose Psychopharmacology (Berl) 140:2 135-41 1998

<p>
Another non-smoker experiment. Transdermal nicotine patches (7 mg/day,
lowest dose of Nicoderm) increased self-reported mood and attention
<br>
(as measured by a computer task). <br>


<p>
The suggestion these papers give is that caffeine improves awakeness,
while nicotine improves attention. Combining them might however cause
tricky reactions, since the arousal level caused by the caffeine will
likely lower or raise the dose of nicotine needed for a certain task.


<p>
Oxygen and cognitive performance: the temporal relationship between
hyperoxia and enhanced memory
<br>
M. C. Moss, A. B. Scholey and K. Wesnes
<br>
Psychopharmacology (Berl), 140:1 123-126 1998

<p>
Yes, oxygen can also improve memory! It seems to act on long-term
memory and attention in healthy young adults (but not short-term
memory). It turns out that transient oxygen administration enhances
memory formation when given up to five minutes before or coincident
with the presentation of a series of words.
