I've seen such lists from time to time.  If I recall correcly, Goethe
tops the lists I've seen with 200+.  I did a quick search for pages
mentioning Goethe, Einstein and IQ and found "Estimated IQs of the
greatest geniuses" at  &lt;<a href="http://home8.swipnet.se/~w-80790/Index.htm">http://home8.swipnet.se/~w-80790/Index.htm</a>&gt;.

<p>
I'm reminded of these lists whenever I realize that a person I'm
dealing with (presumably of average intelligence) just doesn't
get something in the way I do with a measly ~140 IQ.  I wonder about
things that I just don't get that someone with a 180 IQ could.  I'm
not fixated on IQ by a long shot, but I am quite sure that I am
missing out -- and so is someone with a 180 IQ, just to a slightly
lesser extent.  I want a Jupiter brain so I can think wonderful,
beautiful, amazing thoughts.  I don't want to colonize the universe,
I just want an intellectual high.
