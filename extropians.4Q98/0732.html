<a href="0722.html#0732qlink2">&gt; But the security people must know enough about the potential</a><br>
<i>&gt; to decide if the scientists are violating their contract or</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever.  </i><br>

<p>
Not necessarily. In most organizations separate employees have
a limited field of expertise. They are specialized in a certain aspect of
the whole, and have only a vague idea about how the end product
works (or indeed what it is). It's a fairly effective safety feature. 

<p>
<a href="0722.html#0732qlink3">&gt; This only creates yet *another* layer of people</a><br>
<i>&gt; between the "rich and powerful" and the technology.</i><br>

<p>
See above. But, in the end it's fairly trivial who of the select
group with full access to the project, the intelligence to
fully understand its potential, and the guts to use the technology
on themselves will take that final step and upload. To the rest of 
the world it simply spells "trouble". To avoid the rather unpleasant
situation of being at the mercy of a superintelligence there's
only one good solution: be the first, or at least among the first
in case this is a gradual process.
