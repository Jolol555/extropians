<a name="3026qlink2"><a name="3000qlink1">  <li>  One must have a reason to do something before one does it.
  <li>  If one has an overarching goal, one would modify one's subgoals to reach
the overarching goal but would not modify the overarching goal, because one
would not have a reason to do so.</a>


</OL>
<p>
Why would an AI modify it's overriding goals?  What reason would it have?
If it's been programmed with the motive 'Painting things red is good', why
would it change that?  If it did change that (or at last consider what it
meant and why it wanted it), it may well come to the conclusion that
'painting things red is no better than increasing my own intelligence'  but
why would it want to increase its own intelligence?  Why would it think
intelligence was important to it?  It's just another trait, only as
</a>
important as you are programmed to think it is.
