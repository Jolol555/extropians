<p>
Dates and times are used for more than just billing.  They are used for
all sorts of calculations, which I will exemplify below.  Normally, time
always goes into the future.  When calculating how much time has passed,
it always is a positive number.  If the date goes backwards from 1999 to
1900, time periods suddenly go negative.  If the program interprets
negative numbers, it may calculate negative values instead of positive
ones.  If the program doesn't interpret negative numbers, then these
numbers get interpreted as very large numbers because of the way data is
stored.  (The first bit can be used as a sign bit, showing a positive or
negative.  It also can be used as the top order binary digit, allowing
larger positive numbers.)  In either case, programs get unexpected
values that are negative or very large.  Such programs will then do
unexpected things based on these numbers, or they very well may simply
crash and/or hang the machine.

<p>
Some examples of date/time calculations:

<p>
Any machine (such as trains, planes, automobiles cruise controls)
calculating how fast it is going (based on time calculations) suddenly
gets a negative number and thinks it is going backwards and tries to
accelerate to compensate.  Or it gets a very large number and thinks it
is going too fast and tries to decelerate.

<p>
Any machine (such as a printer, automobile, nuclear power plant)
measuring time since its last maintenance suddenly gets a negative
number and thinks it has a long time to go until maintenance is due and
never stops for maintenance and so runs until it burns itself up.  Or it
gets a very large number and thinks its dangerously past maintenance and
refuses to run at all until maintenance is performed.

<p>
Any machine (such as a medicinal IV drip) that meters out materials at a
certain rate suddenly gets a negative number and thinks it is a long
time until materials are due and so stops releasing materials.  Or it
gets a very large number and thinks it is way past due and so dumps out
an extraordinarily high amount of materials to catch up.

<p>
Not only does billing get screwed up, but any machine trying to track
speed, rates of delivery, time since maintenance, etc. can get screwed
up.

<p>
Dates are also used to calculate the days of the week.  Bank vaults may
lock up on the wrong days.  VCRs may record on the wrong days.  Coffee
makers may make coffee on the wrong days.  Alarm systems, sprinkler
systems, automated lighting schedules, power grid peak production
schedules, automated trucking schedules, etc., may try to operate on the
wrong days or not operate on the correct days.

<p>
Sometimes dates are important as well.  Even though these may be
"billing", consider if your credit card won't work because it expired in
"1901".  Consider materials or food being thrown out because it is past
its expiration date of "1901".  Consider your mechanic not performing
proper maintenance on your car because his computer thinks it has a
hundred years before your oil change is due.  Consider all TV
programming, automated factory schedules, banking transfers, trucking
schedules, etc., all failing on computers and having to be done by hand
by certain affected companies.

<p>
Sometimes the date calculations will just crash because of the bogus
numbers.  Imagine a cash register trying to print how many shopping days
until christmas, trying to calculate 100 years of shopping days,
overflowing the output field which is 3 digits long, and just crashing
everytime it tries to print a receipt.  Most programs don't expect
simple date calculations to overflow into extremely large values, so
they don't check for them.  If they overflow, the program just crashes
in many cases.  Even if the dates aren't important for the operations,
they still could prevent the machine from functioning due to field
overflows.

<p>
These are just some ideas about what could go wrong.<a name="0571qlink1">  My predicition is
that 99% of the errors will be fixed in time, but that the 1% left will
<a name="0571qlink2">wreak havoc.</a>  Imagine just one satellite failing, or one airport not
being able to fly, or one major computer network being down, or one
phone company going dead, or one state of the U.S. losing its power
</a>
grid, or one stock exchange shutting down, or one brand of automobile to
all go dead, or one brand of computer operating system to suddenly quit
working, or one country mistakingly launching missiles.  A small
percentage of failure can cause widespread problems.
