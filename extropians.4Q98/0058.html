     At this [*] humanist site we find a studied analysis
     by Joseph McCabe on whether or not Buddha was an
     atheist, which concludes: "The real authorities 
     agree that Buddha was an atheist." 

     From chapter one of the book "The Humanist Way"
     (<a href="http://www.ethicalsociety.org/greatest.htm">http://www.ethicalsociety.org/greatest.htm</a>):

<br>
     "Be ye lamps unto yoursleves. Work out your own <br>
     salvation," admonished the Buddha. ...Unlike the 
     monotheistic prophets and reformers...[ Buddha ] 
     put no stock in gods and saviours. Like the anci-
     ent Roman poet Lucretius, gautama the Buddha be-
     lieved that if the gods exist, they are of no con-
     cern to us. If anything, speculations about the 
     gods distract us from what we must do to accomplish 
     our primary psychological and spiritual task of 
     self-mastery. The early followers of Buddha...take 
     great pains to prevent the elevation of their 
     Master [bad word] to the status of a divine being...

<br>
     "If you meet the Buddha on the highway, kill him," <br>
     goes a somewhat startling Buddhist proverb. But the 
     harsh maxim drives home a vital truth: No holy prophet,
     messiah, christ, avatar, or even a great god in heaven 
     can do your spiritual or ethical task for you. Free 
     yourself. Be a lamp unto your own salvation!"

   Albert Einstein on Buddhism:

<p>
     "Buddhism has the characteristics of what would <br>
<pre>
     be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: 
     it transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and 
     theology; it covers both the natural &amp; spiritual, 
     and it is based on a religious sense aspiring 
     from the experience of all things, natural 
     and spiritual, as a meaningful unity."
