<i>&gt; joe, i didnt get to finish my previous thought.  i looked thru my copy of</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; in 89 i had been thinking about space stations.  k eric goes on about</i><br>
<i>&gt; how nanotech will be the great breakthru in manufacturing that will</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0360qlink1"><i>&gt; my notion at the time was that humans could actually reinvent</i><br>

<i>&gt; could be the scale of ants, yet if our atoms were correctly utilized,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we would still be these wonderfully brilliant creatures that we are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (humble too).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; then, the launcher problem would already be solved,</i><br>
<i>&gt; by good old 1950s rocket technology.  the scarcity of materials</i><br>
<i>&gt; and energy in space would be solved, by the same old technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; even a tiny asteroid would have plenty of raw materials for billion</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "us".  our modest home planet would then be unimaginably</i><br>
<i>&gt; emmense and its gravitational field remarkably gentle.  has this</i><br>
<i>&gt; notion been explored in sci fi?  spike</i><br>

<a name="0336qlink1">Wrong, wrong, wrong!  There is a certain Godelian critical mass of 
<a name="0360qlink2">cortical complexity (translation: quantity of neurons and synaptic 
connections) necessary for the emergence of self-reference (and 
much more for context-sensitively evolving self-and-other 
</a>consciousness).  Read "Biology as Ideology" by Richard C. 
Lewontin, who trenchantly make the point that it is our cortical 
volume, providing the space for this complexity to manifest (thus the 
number of connections it allows), that permits the awakening of selfawareness.
  Mighty Mites as mental whizzes are not merely science 
fiction; they are irrevocably anchored in the realm of fantasy.     Joe
