Terry Donaghe asks:
<br>
<a href="3136.html#3145qlink1">&gt;Would yall consider this to be an Extropian statement or philosophy?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="3136.html#3145qlink2">&gt;"I do not advocate the initiation of force to promote social or</a><br>
<i>&gt;political goals."</i><br>

<p>
Since it's essentially an affirmation of spontaneous order, I'd say it's a
very Extropian statement. I reaffirm it each time I renew my LP membership.
To me it's one of the simplest and most profound expressions ever penned of
what it means to be civilized.

<p>
<a href="3136.html#3145qlink3">&gt;I think that most Americans (regardless of political affiliation)</a><br>
<i>&gt;would agree with this statement on first reading, but if you read</i><br>
<i>&gt;between the lines, it pretty much precludes government in general.</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, wouldn't it be great if the majority of people agreed with it,
realizing its full implications? Our struggle against hegemony would be won
practically overnight.

<p>
As I see it, our task is basically to prod people into thinking through
what their common sense tells them.
