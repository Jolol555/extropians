<p>
Kind of like "Anarchists of the world.......UNITE!!!!!!".....????

<p>
Therein lies the heart of the problem...imho.  

<p>
I'm either a libertarian or an anarchist.  depends on the time of day.  I
don't want to boss anyone around...and I deeply resent BEING bossed around.
It must be genetic because I've been like a fish swimming upstream all my life
in that regard....I have a very solitary job...and prefer being alone to being
in a crowd.  

<p>
<a name="1760qlink1">So we have a libertarian party...right.  By BECOMING a party or member
thereof...all the values and properties that describe an individual</a> as opposed
<a name="1760qlink2">to a "team player" are lost. Possibly if you take a wolf</a> and domesticate him
<a name="1760qlink3">he becomes a dog?  According to current thought to fight them you have to
become them...and thus we are lost.Having lost all differentiation</a> from those
<a name="1760qlink4">whom we oppose.</a>

<p>
Depresssing.

<p>
Thankfully in my observation the prevailing trend of technology is opposing
authoritarianism and consequent centralization. 

<p>
Examples....

<p>
Laptops as opposed to mainframes.

<p>
Desktop publishing as opposed to publishing houses.

<p>
Trucks instead of trains...autos instead of Mass Transit.

<p>
The internet instead of Mass media....

<p>
and many more....


<p>
To counter the political process of today something else must be devised.
Copying the political parties...becoming a politcal party...wont hack
it.....Something analogous to the difference between a laptop vs a
mainframe...
