I haven't read the book, though it should arrive today from amazon.com.

<a name="3142qlink1">I agree with Eliezer that it is likely that we can find clear fMRI 
signatures of conscious intentional lying.  What bothers me more is the 
fact that we are only conscious of the smallest fraction of what goes on 
in our heads.  Our unconsious selves are quite familiar with "lying" to 
our conscious selves to help our genes to reproduce.</a>

<a name="3142qlink2">Romeos sincerely believe they'll "love her forever", even though it'll
be a different her in a week.  Politicians sincerely believe that public
schools are best for us all, even though for some reason they prefer to
send their kids to private schools.  Sales people find it easy to believe
that their product is really the best for you.  Most people find it easy 
to think they are above average drivers, lovers, etc.  "The Moral Animal"
by Robert Wright discusses a lot of this sort of self-deception.  See
also: <a href="http://hanson.berkeley.edu/belieflikeclothes.html">http://hanson.berkeley.edu/belieflikeclothes.html</a>

<a name="3142qlink3">As John Clark said:
<br>
<a href="2875.html#3135qlink2">&gt;Another problem is that the most dangerous and horrible monsters are </a><br>
<i>&gt;also sincere monsters.  I don't think it was just an act, I think Hitler </i><br>
<i>&gt;really thought Jews were subhuman and that he was doing a good thing by</i><br>
<i>&gt;butchering them.  Sincerity is a vastly overrated virtue.</i><br>

<p>
With a truth machine, people would want to avoid intellectuals, cynics,
and others who point out how their "sincere" beliefs are inconsistent and
self-serving.   After all, if they listened to such critics they might
adopt beliefs which would hurt them socially.  "In all likelihood, I'll
only love you this much for a week."  I fear people might instead begin
a strong and perhaps bloody supression of critical voices.  Sorta like
what happens in war time suppressing those who aren't sure the war is a
good idea, only much more so.</a>
