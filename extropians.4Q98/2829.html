Agree absolutely. In fact, I don't see any point in at all having 
people if we have MNT. In case I'd lay my hands on an assembler, and 
could spend quite a few years in a log cabin alone (but with full 
connectivity, please), I'm very willing to demonstrate. (Of course 
a team of people two decades from now could accomplish a lot in a 
single month, so I won't need to play hermit to act upon my promise, 
after all). 

<p>
I admit to have a deep level of discomfort when confronted with the
style of thinking such as yours, or, for instance, JoSH's neat visions
about a 5 t spacecraft, fuel included, capable of delivering 4 people 
to LEO.

<p>
You see, a technology which can do a lot of funky things like that
without even trying hard will not be so surgically selective. In the 
hands of ruthless people ('gene here, for instance) you'll see a lot 
of new unexpected uses crop up rapidly, wave after wave. Of course, 
with MNT the implementation phase is only hours away from the design 
phase (and simulation even being instanteously interactive). So these 
waves could very well be physically visible. Each wave would mount upon wave.

<a name="3312qlink1">I'm a lousy coder, but a lot of what I can't do is limited by the 
kind of computational resources I have at my disposal. I can think
of detailed plans for a desktop hardware giving me a factor of at 
least a billion over the machine I now sit in front of (in fact the 
thing is scalable many orders of magnitude upward, since being 
embarrasingly parallel). I think I could manage such hardware 
after a year or two.</a> I know many people who would be able to become 
productive much sooner. If I had such hardware at my disposal, I'd 
spend the bulk of my wake hours designing a robust GA fit for 
molecular design purposes and creating boundary conditions for 
SI emergence. I could think about 10 kPeople world-wide
would have similiar core motivations, with surely several 100 
kPeople being busy at the tangents of the task, and hang all those 
still sticking to panem et circenses. I can't predict the kinetics 
of this assembly, of course, but intuitively, it would seem very 
Very VERY rapid. Unless you have means of bring the boot down on 
these people simultaneously (if they all possess assemblers, seems 
like a very bad idea indeed), you can't prevent progress from
