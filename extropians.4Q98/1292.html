All we've done is confirm what a priori thinking would tell you ( as an
INTP I trust my a priori thinking a lot &lt;g&gt;).Barring the exceptions on
this list, is someone scoring a high S going to take a field much inspired
by computer science as seriously as someone with a high N? (In other
words, what you call 'adventurousness' isn't mutually exclusive with
rationality (high T) - it corresponds to a high N score). 

<p>
And how would
<br>
someone with a high F as opposed to a high T react to the thought that his
treasured 'feelings' could be reduced to a computer program? The
reductionist element in extropianism is going to turn off high F types
(the types who get outraged at cloning because they think it violates the
'sanctity' of life and so on). The high S types will get turned off by
the amount of speculativeness in extropianism.
