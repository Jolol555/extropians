sure, but you could do the same with files like mp3 or vqf (better
quality, compression ratio) or what standard you want.. it's better to
be independent of the support... to deal with cd audio where the music
is relatively badly encoded (too much space needed) is far more
expensive. Think to all the hardware and mechanics needed for a simple
jukebox... waste of material and money. Think that a CDR full of vqf can
have something like 14 cd audio compressed in it... for the quality, i
confess i'm totally unable to make a difference, so that's good for me.
You will probably have to encode your cds in the future anyway... And
you don't need to take mp3 with you... you could more easily transfer
these files from a server anywhere in the world and with far less
bandwidth. For me it's more convenient, confortable, more easy and
secure, to have all my cd collection on hard drives... no need to
expensive mechanical systems with probably a bad mtbf.

<a name="1719qlink1">Of course i would like to have a small personal assistant with GSM
capabilities connected permanently to the Internet and with the
bandwidth needed to be able to receive high quality music, HDTV, film on
demand, mails, Internet, books, video games, windows98 compatible/ java
(or another system), with an interface somewhat like the glasstron of
sony, with 3d capabilities, enhanced reality, capability to analyze the
environment and a huge working memory. If i can interface it directly
into my brain, i will be even more happy</a> ;)
