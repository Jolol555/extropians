Perhaps I was being too polite. In general, When I see something on the
web that is nearly 100% associated with paranormal and for which I can
find no obviously credible scientific literature, I assume that it is
hogwash. I'm always willing to reassess this assumption if credible
evidence comes along, but I feel no need to spend much time looking for
it. I'll leave that to people who have the expertise, the time, and the
interest. My "research" (5 minutes scanning the Web) leads me to believe
Persinger saw the type of effects you describe as easily reporducible
with MRI equipment. Then he, or perhaps others, extrapolated wildly beyond
his data and off into fantasy land.
