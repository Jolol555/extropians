I can't see why, We probably all have some moral system, but we surely
don't always follow it. I'm a strong relativist and I strongly feel that
there is not true objective moral system, but there is of course one
somewhat hardwired in my brain, statistically I follow it almost all the
time, but from time to time I do an act wrong in this moral system and
because I also think it's totally subjective, i'm feeling bad and don't
feel bad about it at the same time. The later wins after mostly in a
little time. I'm sure a greater intelligence will have the ability to be
strongly multiplex in his world views and will be able to deal with
strong contradictions and inconsistencies in his beliefs</a> ;)...
