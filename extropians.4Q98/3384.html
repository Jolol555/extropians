I mean that if there is any sentient extraterrestrial life in this galaxy
then they're not out there actively exploring and manipulating it. If they
were, we should be able to see them from here, and we can't. Admittedly
there is some chance that we just happen to live at a time when the others
are out there busily dismantling the galaxy and turning it into 
Jupiter-brains but they're far enough away that we can't yet see them, 
however that's unlikely.

<p>
Basically there's no evidence of any expansionist extraterrestrial life;
I prefer to take the simple solution of assuming there are no such creatures,
rather than make up convoluted explanations of why they're hiding from us.
I'd like to be proven wrong, but I don't think I will be.
