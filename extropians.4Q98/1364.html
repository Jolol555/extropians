  IAN: Well, that identity is holistic is manifestly 
  obvious and I have challenged many here to present 
  even one example of a non-holistic identity, and, 
  apart from insults, none have been able to do so. 

<p>
  Ironically you've implied holistic identity is 
  lacking evidence. Can you site the evidence of 
  non-holistic identity you seem to be aware of?

<p>
  I've also shown how a zero-sum can be derived 
  from any state of difference and many physical 
  quantities. It's quite an eye-opener to discover,
  lo and behold, a zero-sum of all energy has been 
  "on the books" since 1962, yet generally unknown,
  even as it provides linchpin support for on of the
  leading theories of our time, the Big Bang theory.

<p>
  The one identity that I believe is nonholistic --
  that is, it isn't derived from interrelations --
  is the number 0. Zero is zero exactly due to its
  difference with itself (0 - 0 = 0), but every nonzero
   number n is what it is due to its difference
  from zero (n - 0 = n and n = 0 + n) and since n is
  not 0, all nonzero numbers are holistic identities,
  which is to say, n is derived by relation to not n.

<p>
  But zero is an identity attribute of each number
  relative to itself,  and is a measure that there 
  is a symmetrical distribution of identity attributes
   in a given system, which is a symptom of
  holistic identity, evidenced in the case that 
  the identity of all nonzero real numbers is 
  holistic and the sum of all reals equals 0.

<p>
  Everything must = 0 (I posit) since everything, 
  the whole itself, isn't derived from external 
  relations, and zero is the "map" of the self-
  lf relation, which is a null relation.
