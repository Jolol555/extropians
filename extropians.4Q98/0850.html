<a name="0862qlink1">I agree with Kathryn that transhumanists should be vitally concerned about the
misogynist policies of Islamic fundamentalists (and most religions, for that
matter -- consider the appalling treatment of widows even today in Hindu India
and the "obedient wife" prescriptions of traditional, mainstream
Christianity).  Transhumanism is about liberation; ultimately, liberation from
the limits of the biological human form.</a>

<a name="0852qlink1">The Taliban make my blood boil.  When I see stories about what they are doing,
I want to pack up my arsenal and ship it to women in Afghanistan, along with a
crate of feminist literature.  But then I realize that the sort of memetic
action on this side of the knowledge wall the Taliban are building that
Kathryn mentioned is about all we can do for now.</a>

The relatively near future, though, may hold the promise for something more:

&gt; kathryn, i read the site.  enrages one, does it not?  i have been toying

<a name="1279qlink1"><a name="0923qlink1">This is something I've been thinking about for a long time.  How do we help
people like women in Afghanistan, or peasants in Indonesia, or all of the rest
of the folks who are cut off from the information revolution?  I've envisioned
a technology that could help, something I call a "Brain Seed".</a>  Imagine a
network terminal with an embedded satellite modem.  The device is built simple
and tough -- as much one piece of solid-state electronics as possible, and the
hard-wired communications software is built to be maximally tamper-resistant.
Also hard-wired into it is a curriculum of basic literacy, from the picturebook
 level on up.  With the operation of Moore's Law and advancing material
science, such devices could be made very cheaply in 15-20 years.  Now, make
billions of these things and make them available to any organization that
wants to distribute them, at a minimal profit.  Include them with aid
packages.  Smuggle them into any</a> country that prohibits them.  Air drop them
-- hell, air drop them from robot aircraft . . .  Better yet, eventually make
them in a form that IS a robot aircraft so that they become self-delivering.
Saturate the planet with them.  Then see what happens. . .
