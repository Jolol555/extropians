<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Please, try to get rid of that silly Hollywood meme.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks for the advice, but I actually got this meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Jim Halperin who impressed upon me how</i><br>
<i>&gt; the destructive capabilities of the single individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; have increased so dramatically with technology.</i><br>

<p>
Ah, not that one. I completely agree with you and Halperin in that we
are going to have trouble with increased power at the hands of single
individuals. This is of course only a problem if this power cannot be
counteracted by the large majority of non-maniacs, but in some
technological areas there are more spears than shields, so to say.

<p>
The silly Hollywood meme I was refering to was the evil genius. I
don't know about the incidence of antisocial behavior among geniuses
but a quick guess is that it is normal or below normal; they might be
eccentric or flaunt their societies' norms, but few seems to be
downright antisocial. The evil genius meme is just the continuation of
the evil magician meme (in our mythology, scientists and magicians are
isomorphic; in Hollywood they can't even tell the difference), the old
fear of somebody wielding unstoppable black magic.

<p>
Most magic/technology is stoppable. And I worry more about evil people
than evil geniuses, the later are so rare they are not important even
if they have more destructive creativity.
