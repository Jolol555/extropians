More wishful thinking than a workaround, _smart_ trend recognition software
would do the job but don't ask _me_ how to write it!

Selling spare cycles and bandwidth may be nice, but how do you conquer
the system perversion problem, particularly if your code mutates? (Those of
you who participated in rc5/bovine may have noticed that some of the
clients had hidden 'features', now if you can execute arbitrary code
directly or via buffer overruns... ouch) This is a problem even 
with ppp dialup, with xDSL/crosslinked local networking the global 
system is at a catastrophic threshold.

<p>
I'd estimate we'd be damn lucky if we can evade a global worm during 
the next few years. You don't even need a GP engine, a small
handcrafted exploit library (notice that even switch firmware like 
IOS is vulnerable) is totally sufficient. If the code can search 
for constructive buffer overruns on its own, god help us. After 
the wintel boxen are taken over and used for subversion platforms, 
the rest of the systems can't be far behind. In any case will 
networks be unusable, since saturated with perversion packets.

<p>
In fact, the longer it takes before the worm strikes, the more
<a name="1387qlink1">dramatic will the effects be. If the worm strikes a decade from now,
y2k will look like an infinitesimally small beer in comparison.

<p>
How can one address it? TCP/IP is too complex to be implemented in
hardware, and protocols stacks cannot be made secure. Even if, there
is still the application layer. Even security by obscurity (system
diversity, which is not necessary an observable trend) won't help if
the code is smart enough to discover exploits autonomously.

<p>
Does anybody see any workaround against this? I don't.
