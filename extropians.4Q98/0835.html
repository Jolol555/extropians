Abstract
<br>
  Silymarin can be extracted from the milk thistle, and
  silibinin is the main component of the plant
  extract. Possibly due to their antioxidant and
  membrane-stabilizing properties, the compounds have been shown to protect
  different organs and cells against a number of insults. Thus liver, kidney,
  erythrocytes and platelets have been protected from the toxic effects of
  ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, cold ischemia and drugs, respectively. The
  effect of silibinin on endocrine and exocrine pancreas, however, has not been
  studied. We therefore investigated whether silibinin treatment attenuates
  cyclosporin A (CiA) toxicity on rat endocrine and exocrine pancreas. Groups
  of 15 male Wistar rats were treated for 8 days with CiA and/or silibinin. On
  day 9, endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions were tested in vitro. At
  the end of the treatment period, blood glucose levels in vivo were
  significantly higher in rats treated with CiA while silibinin did not affect
  glucose levels. In vitro, insulin secretion was inhibited after treatment
  with silibinin, but amylase secretion was not affected.
  After treatment with CiA both insulin and amylase secretion were reduced.
  Silibinin and CiA had an additive inhibitory effect on insulin secretion, but
  silibinin attenuated CiA-induced inhibition of amylase secretion. Despite CiA
  treatment, amylase secretion was in fact restored to normal with the highest
  dose of silibinin. Thus silibinin inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release
  in vitro, while not affecting blood glucose concentration in vivo. This
  combination of effects could be useful in the treatment of
  non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, silibinin protects the
  exocrine pancreas from CiA toxicity. As this inhibitory effect is probably
  unspecific, silibinin may also protect the exocrine pancreas against other
  insult principles, such as alcohol.
