<p>
And limiting the range of human behavior is necessarily a bad thing?
Civilization has consisted in large part of expanding the range in some
direction while limiting it in others -- and the limits are often what make
the expansion possible.  First World civil servants have limited behavior
compared with their typical Third World counterparts, where corruption is
endemic; this is not a bad thing.  Impulse killing seems more restrained these
days too, despite deadlier weaponry.

For one thing the market would run much more smoothly, I'd think.</a>

Disabling selected individuals, yes, that would be bad.
