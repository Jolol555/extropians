For what it's worth I'd much prefer a government that remained clueless
until it was too late.
<br>
I had thought that having a techno-savvy politico like Al Gore was a good
thing until he showed his true colors on crypto.

This is getting absurd.  &lt;sarcasm&gt; Why don't we debate Gingrich's skill at

While I agree that it's nice for Congress to be forward-looking, it would
be much nicer if he had more libertarian leanings than it would be that he
be at Future Shock level 4.  The future can take care of itself; all we
want/need gov't to do is get out of the way!
