My god, here is a platform I would actually feel good voting</a> for. For the
past ten years I have held my nose and voted to the candidate I disliked the
least. Lately I have just been voting libertarian as a protest vote. I
figured if the alternative parties got at least 10% of the vote it might
wake up the main political parties to get them out of our personal lives.
Here is someone who actually could win an election on issues I agree with
for the most part! I wish we had someone in California that would run on a
similar platform. Any extropians into politics who want to run on a similar
platform would get my vote.

<p>
Best Ralph
