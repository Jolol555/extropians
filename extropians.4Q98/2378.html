<a name="2381qlink1"><a href="2372.html#2378qlink1">&gt;Any defense of socialism I would mount would have to take into</a><br>
accountthreebasic assumptions:

<p>
<a href="2372.html#2378qlink2">&gt;(1) Human nature is such that all people try to benifit themselves</a><br>
(andto alesser extent their &gt;friends/relatives) as much as possible.
Thank goodness!  This is almost a good enough reason by itself to
preclude socialism.

<p>
<a name="2398qlink1"><i>&gt;(2)	'Property' does not actually exist and is merely a way of saying</i><br>
'Idenyyou access to this'.

<p>
This is blatant nonsense.  It's like saying love does not exist.  Your
entire argument suffers because of this.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2381qlink2"><a href="2372.html#2378qlink3">&gt;(3)	 Sufficient social/monetary inequality leads to social disruption.</a><br>

<p>
	Social/monetary inequality is most often caused by government.</a>  When
<a name="2381qlink3">governments fool with prices (setting wages, regulating markets,
socializing medicine, providing “free” education) they disrupt the
natural effect of capitalism which is to set a fair price for every
good and service.</a>  This causes income disparities (the government
creates artificial markets enriching some and steals money from others
for taxation making all poorer).

<p>
<a name="2381qlink4"><a href="2372.html#2378qlink4">&gt;(3) tends to cause problems in capitalist societies on an</a><br>
internalbasis (inthe UK, under more capitalist &gt;policies the
percentage differencebetween therich and the poor went up by about 7%
over the 10 years the &gt;conservativeparty was in power. This caused
large amounts of social unrest, demonstrations and the &gt;biggest
landslide in living history for theiropposition party).

<p>
	This is obviously because of the socialist government of the UK.  As
</a>
I said above, tampering with prices causes these problems.  Well
meaning social programs siphons money (in the form of taxation) out of
the economy and filters it through bureaucracies (where most of it
goes thppppt!) and deposits what’s left in the hands of those
unwilling or unable to earn it in the first place.  If the economy was
left alone, prices would be set at a fair and sustainable level and
money would flow to those who earn it.  Those unable to earn money
should be supported by charity.  Those unwilling to earn money should
be left to rot.

<p>
<a href="2372.html#2378qlink5">&gt;Communists tend to forget point (1) and focus on point (2).</a><br>
<i>&gt;Capitalists tend to forget point (2) and focus on point (1)</i><br>
Point (2) as I said is nonsense.

<p>
<a href="2372.html#2378qlink6">&gt;A fourth point is sometimes useful to remember.(4) Homo Sapiens is a</a><br>
pack animal that naturally &gt;speaking has a heirarchy.  People are most
comfortable with a chain of command. They like to feelthatthe &gt;chain
of command listens to them and considers their feelings andthatit is
looking out for them. It is a &gt;mistake to indulge this too much,butit
is worth bearing in mind.

<p>
What a broad, generalizing statement!  Are you implying that simply
because MOST people prefer a chain of command, that we should all be
subject to one?   Remember, in the 1800’s MOST people in the southern
USA felt slavery was necessary.  Does that make it right?  Most people
can’t name all nine planets or point to their home city on a map. 
Should we be subject to THEM?

<p>
<a href="2372.html#2378qlink7">&gt;Having shown that both Communist and Capitalist societies tend to</a><br>
forgetabout one of (1) or (2) thus &gt;causing (3), I would say that it
makessense to mix them sluightly, taking into account of both (1) and
(2) &gt;whichgives...socialism.

<p>
I’m afraid you’ve “shown” nothing.  

<p>
<a name="2383qlink3"><i>&gt;My preferred method of socialism would be to provide free Health</i><br>
Care(of astandard necessary to get &gt;people back to work) and enough of
</a>a handouttoallow people to survive. This handout should _not_ be
<br>
<i>&gt;means tested (ifitdrops as they start earning here is less incentive</i><br>

<br>
<i>&gt;FreeEducation will also be provided (education leads to raised output</i><br>
andhigherGNP's as well as lowering &gt;reproduction), but not in the
current form -ashas been pointed out most current education sucks.I
look &gt;forward to hearing objections.Samael

<p>
Tsk tsk…  Your “free” education (which is funded by money forcibly
stolen from wage earners) and socialized medicine (which is similarly
funded) has left you blinded to the outrages perpetrated by socialism
(theft, violence, subjugation, involuntary servitude).  I suggest very
strongly that you get a copy of Henry Hazlitt’s “Economics in One
Lesson.”  I think it would serve to open your eyes.
