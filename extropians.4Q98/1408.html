"Singleton" and "completely isolated individuals" are essentially the
extreme endpoints of a continuum of possible organizations that humans
believe they can understand. I suspect that neitehr extreme is achievable.
Our current civilization is not comprised of completely isolated individuals,
although I suspect thar we are closser to the "individuals" end of the
<a name="1418qlink1">continuum. We can of course attempt to guess where the SI will be along this
continuum or how it will evolve along this continuum. First, I think we need
to decide how likely it is that an SI is restricted to this continuum at all.
It looks like the typical oversimplified bipolar mapping of a multivarate
space to me, sort of like Myers-Brigg.
