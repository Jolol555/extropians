<i>&gt; flexibility becomes obvious, even without any social</i><br>
<i>&gt; context. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is obviously inflexible, as is</i><br>
<i>&gt; paranoid delusions. Depressives cannot easily shift out of their black</i><br>
<i>&gt; mood, borderline personalities seem to be unable to comfort themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; and need others to do it, frontal lobe damage limits the ability to</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is easy to play games with the definition of mental illness, but</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
Sure people get caught in attractors which they can't get out of and an
illness ensues, but what starts them on the downward spin is often
environmental and actual damage is quite another thing altogether.

<p>
These definitional games are often the problem. I live in the extreme
right wing dictatorial fascist state of New Zealand where people's life
expectancy nowadays is almost the lowest in the developed world. In a
recent poll, only 16% of the population expects the health system to be
there for them when they really need it. Changing definitions of
disability and illness are often used by the government when they fuck
with the population and quite regularly, via the news media these days,
decide who lives and who dies. So lumping problems together with
illnesses and disabilities caused by damage is quite a negative aspect
of the duck shoving and obfuscation that goes hand in hand with a
society that will not own up to its own social ills, such as fascism,
gangs, etc.
