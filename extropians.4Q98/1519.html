O.K. Gene.  In an earlier note I mentioned a time machine game, and 
said "We're in 2020, you're in 1998".  

<p>
I retract that.  I'm in 2010.  You're in 2050.

Here's a fantasy scenario:  So and so calls up Texas Instruments and 
says "Give Drexler's cult whatever they need to build a broadband 
wireless internet with distributed computing.  They can go home to 
their jacuzzi's in their backyards in Silicon Valley and sit around 
and take bong hits while figuring out how to keep all the unemployed 
telecommunications and information industry workers busy.  We'll 
send them a piles of special series U.S. $20's in manila envelopes.  
Even give 'em coke or speed if it will help them focus and get some 
work done.  I hope they come up with something that can be programmed 
easily from their wall mounted flat panel displays."

<p>
"Send that Gene guy a ticket to get to Silicon Valley and stay 
there.  He comes up with some good head trips on the extropian list, 
but their way too busy with erudite acronyms and chip fab 
terminology.  Let's see if he can come up with a fucking shopping 
list instead, so I don't sound like too much of a fool when 
commanding the CEO's of Motorola and TI to give him his chips.  
Hopefully, the spec's will fit on a page or two, because I don't 
feel like lugging a notebook around on the golf course."
