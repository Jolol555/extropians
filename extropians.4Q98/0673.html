I received similiar indications when I spoke with a public
relations person at SETI today. I was told SETI was going to 
place information to the effect that the entire affair appeared to
be a hoax sometime today. The information I found on the subject
lends weight to the "hoax" probability:

However, SETI has yet to make any announcement on their website
nor has any other group emerged to debunk the claim. Strangely,
the BBC has not issued any follow-up on the story either.
