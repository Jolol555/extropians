The following Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article 
cites a major utility company recommending citizens 
look into "alternative energy sources" in preparation
for "likely" power failures due to the Y2k computer bug
(<a href="http://www.onwis.com/archive/oct98/news/1007y2k.asp">http://www.onwis.com/archive/oct98/news/1007y2k.asp</a>):

National Guard ready to act on eve of 2000 

<p>
Computers' confusion could endanger safety, 
experts tell lawmakers 

<p>
By Amy Rinard 

<p>
Madison -- The Wisconsin National Guard is prepared 
to be mobilized on Dec. 31, 1999, to deal with potential 
power failures, water system shutdowns and other problems 
that could occur as computers click over to the year 2000. 

<p>
And an attorney for a major electric utility said the company 
is encouraging its customers to look into alternative energy 
sources, including home generators, in anticipation of power 
failures as a result of the problem. 

<p>
<i>...</i><br>

<p>
Mari Nahn, an attorney with Madison-based Alliant Corp.
-Wisconsin Power &amp; Light Co., said power failures are
likely, as are failures of municipal water systems. 

<p>
Computer chips embedded in everything from pacemakers 
to coffee-makers have the potential to fail, and in 
many cases people don't even know they're there, Nahn 
said. In the utility industry, embedded chips are 
used everywhere, she added. 

<p>
<i>...</i><br>

<p>
Leonard P. Levine, professor of computer science and 
electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-
 said having troops on standby is "not 
<br>
unreasonable." 

<p>
<i>...</i><br>

<p>
"Somewhere -- no one knows where -- something will 
fall apart. I truly believe that someone is going to 
die because of this problem. . . . I'm sure that one 
of these utilities is going to fail."
