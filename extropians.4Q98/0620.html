Max More responds to Hal Finney:
<br>
<a href="0604.html#0620qlink1">&gt;&gt;Suppose a ship is being launched to the stars, at relatively slow speeds,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;which will take centuries to make the journey.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Bringing kids into such an environment dooms them to life in space</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;as certainly as biologically adapting them would.  If we accept the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;historical precedent for parents to have children in environments which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;limit their choices, shouldn't we accept that modifying them is equally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;permissible?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If a whole bunch of people are going into space for a long journey to</i><br>
<i>&gt;another star, then it may sense for them to have children with no legs (or</i><br>
<i>&gt;extra arms). ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is different from the case as described by Pizulli. The legless people</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be well adapted for a space voyage. But they may not want to go on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;voyage. Then, they either must compelled or conditioned into going (both of</i><br>
<i>&gt;which I find ethically unacceptable), or they will stay on Earth and find</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves physically disadvantaged.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In one case, given that you're going on the trip, you are maximizing your</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineered children's choices and abilities. In the other you are reducing</i><br>
<i>&gt;them, perhaps drastically (if they are forced to go). So I see these as</i><br>
<i>&gt;essentially different cases from a moral point of view.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0648qlink1">Consider someone considering setting up a colony on the moon, where a legless
colonist could barely afford passage back to Earth, or around Jupiter, where 
transportation is just too expensive for a legless colonist to afford passage
back to Earth.  Max's moral calculus would encourage them to set up</a> the colony
<a name="0648qlink2">at Jupiter rather than the Moon, all else equal.</a>  

<p>
<a name="0648qlink3">This seems perverse to me, and argues for Hal's position.  Another example 
would be: it is all right to make a Morlock tuned for mining deep beneath 
the Earth, as long as you close off all the tunnels they could use to return
to the surface?  I don't like the idea that you can do things</a> to people which 
<a name="0648qlink4">would be considered bad in our environment, but which are all right</a> as long as 
<a name="0648qlink5">you limit their options to move.</a>
