<a href="0243.html#0249qlink1">&gt;One of my favorite SF writers, Greg Egan, has dealt with this brilliantly,</a><br>

  IAN: Such may evidence that there is no spiritual
  entity. If there were, and if it was aware of the 
  "alien control" of its brain (tool), then one would
  assume that there should be a conflict, as in the 
  case where someone steals your property. But if 
  there is no ghost in the box, then if you simply 
  just flip the "I want to do x" switch, voila "I 
  want to do x." So, it seems that there's no spiritual
   overseer, simply a set of interacting systems that 
  evolved into a large system (brain) wherein systems 
  follow commands sent from other subsystems, and the 
  implant is automatically accepted as a system member,
  and therefore, what it wants to do, "I want to do."

<p>
  Since the incidence of brain implantation intended
  to seize control of a brain is virtually unheard of 
  in the natural world, brains never had to evolve 
  strategies to detect and repel such invasion, 
  and as a result, it can occur with impunity.

<a href="0243.html#0249qlink2">&gt;Marc Steigler's wonderfully extropian story, "The Gentle Seduction"</a><br>
<i>&gt;(reprinted in Nanodreams) does something like you mention. His character</i><br>
<i>&gt;receives an implant bestowing mathematical abilities. The new calculative</i><br>
<i>&gt;abilities seem to the person to come not from an external device, but from</i><br>
<i>&gt;her own mind. That's the way a good interface should be! Perhaps that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;one mark of an enhancement/augmentation vs. the addition of a separate</i><br>
device.


<p>
  IAN: And with the implants that they have now,
  into which neurones actually grow and attach 
  themselves directly to the electrodes(!), the 
  concept of "self" and "other" really dissolves. 

<p>
  If we also say, the "self" of X is that which 
  X has produced according to its genetic code,
  such that the bones in my foot are "Ian" since
  they were constructed by me as per my DNA code.
  In the same way, the implants were constructed
  by humans as per their DNA code that allows for 
  the development of advanced technologies. So in
  effect, the collective human entity has evolved
  a more dynamic evolution strategy, one that is
  expressed by the invention of new technologies
  and application of them to current survival. 
  In this way, all of our gadgets are natural,
  and bionic implants are natural evolutions.
