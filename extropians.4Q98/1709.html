I suppose the murderer could classify what he/she did as a "hobby."

<a href="1707.html#1709qlink7">&gt;&gt;Second,I feel that the death penalty is the appropriate</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;punishment for the unlawful and malicious killing of a fellow</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;human being.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1707.html#1709qlink8">&gt;Let's discuss whether "punishment" is appropriate to begin with.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Quick, what's the difference between punishment and revenge? I see</i><br>
<i>&gt;no real distinction; punishment is simply more "official" sounding</i><br>
<i>&gt;(and often cloaked in "legality" - see my earlier posting) and is</i><br>
<i>&gt;imposed by supposed "authorities".</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1713qlink5">Revenge: to inflict harm in return for an injury etc.</a>

<p>
<a name="1713qlink6">Punishment: To undergo pain, loss etc as for a crime.</a>

<p>
<a name="1713qlink7">(source: Websters New World dictionary.)</a>

<p>
It is considerably more than "official" sounding. As mentioned
above as citizens of a government we are subject to legal
definitions.

<p>
<a href="1707.html#1709qlink9">&gt;What civil order requires is protection, and restitution where</a><br>
<i>&gt;possible, not revenge.</i><br>

<p>
Punishment, not revenge. Punishment for which in the case of murder
may result in life-forfeit.

<p>
<a href="1707.html#1709qlink10">&gt;It gets a little trickier, of course, where restitution is not</a><br>
<i>&gt;(yet) possible, as in the case of murder. Some compensation can</i><br>
<i>&gt;still be provided to the bereaved. Social ostracism and other</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-aggressive measures can help insure that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;murderously-inclined individual has little opportunity to repeat</i><br>
<i>&gt;the offense. In incorrigible cases, exile is a possibility, not as</i><br>
<i>&gt;punishment but as a defensive action.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1718qlink9"><a name="1713qlink8">No compensation or restitution is adequate or possible. Only
justice in the form of equivalent punishment.</a></a>

<p>
<a href="1707.html#1709qlink11">&gt;The guiding principle IMO should be to meet force with the least</a><br>
<i>&gt;force necessary. There are all sorts of ways we can avoid becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt;the sort of people we oppose. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1713qlink9">I do not agree that taking these measures ever makes us even
remotely like them.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;Surely we Extropians ought to be in the vanguard of the</i><br>
<a href="1707.html#1709qlink12">&gt;progress toward true civilization.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1713qlink11">We are in complete agreement here. I too advocate taking
appropriate measures early in life to try to prevent these things.
But insist also in proper action when the unfortunate occurs.</a>
