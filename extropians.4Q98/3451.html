Yes, especially since atheism is based on a practical, scientific view
of the universe, we have to wonder when someone like Stephen Hawking
gives talks claiming that ANYthing can come out of a black hole, even
Cthulhu itself. Now, probabilities are evidence of a sort (they must be,
since DNA rules of evidence rely on probabilities), so we can rationally
calculate the probability of a supernatural event (the only one we have
absolute or near absolute knowledge of is the big bang), where we define
the supernatural as not something which behaves outside the realm of
physical laws, but something which behaves in the realm of physical laws
but is in the most extreme probability of existing within the universe
at any given time.
