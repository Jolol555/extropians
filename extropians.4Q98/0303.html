<p>
I am the new chief editor at Journal of Transhumanism
(<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/">http://www.transhumanist.com/</a>).  We have published two 
articles so far, and hope to gain a reputation as an 
academic quality journal.

<p>
We use peer review to evaluate submissions, and since our 
subject area is interdisciplinary, we are in special need 
of qualified "experts" willing to review articles.

<p>
If you have some relevant expertize and are willing to 
review submissions, please send me a paragraph length 
description of your areas of expertize, and the 
reasons you consider yourself knowledgeable in those 
areas (e.g., degrees, publications, projects).  

<p>
Doing so does not commit you to reviewing anything -
you may later decline requests for reasons of a lack of 
time, conflict of interest, or lack of expertize.  But we do 
seek a rapid written response from those who agree to review 
- so far our slowest evaluation has taken three weeks.
