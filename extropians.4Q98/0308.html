<a name="0637qlink2">Taking into account everyone's thoughts, and keeping in mind the idea of
having more than one sense of the term "transhumanism", I've come up with
two definitions that I prefer to the one I was using. In doing so, I've
attempted to stick close to how the dictionary defines a term</a> like "humanism".

<p>
TRANSHUMANISM
<br>
<a name="0637qlink3"><a name="0318qlink1">1. Any system or way of thought or action concerned with the rational use
of science, technology, creativity, and other means to overcome human
limitations by extending maximum lifespan, augmenting intelligence, and
enhancing humans physically and psychologically.

<p>
2. The intellectual and cultural movement that shares with humanism a
commitment to human progress especially through applied reason rather than
faith; it differs from humanism in affirming the possibility and
desirability of fundamentally altering the human condition for the better,
such as by using technology to eliminate aging and greatly enhance human
intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.</a>


<p>
<a name="0312qlink1">If a non-normative definition is needed, as distinct from one referring to
transhumanism as a system of values or a cultural movement:

</a><p>
TRANSHUMANISM: The view that it is both possible for us in the next couple
of centuries to use science, technology, and any rational means</a> to overcome
human limitations by extending our maximum lifespan, augmenting our
intelligence, and redesigning ourselves physically and psychologically.

<p>
Onward!
