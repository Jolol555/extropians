Given the level of tax cuts for the richest people in British society, the
poor must have got a lot richer for the difference to only be 7%. And, uh,
so what?</a>

As the greedy socialists realised they could no longer screw as much money
out of people who did work for a living. 

<p>
<a href="2372.html#2383qlink2">&gt;and the biggest landslide in living history for their</a><br>

<p>
Given that a) there is essentially no difference between the Labor and
Conservative parties, except that the Labor party have started reducing
welfare payments whereas the Conservatives only talked about doing so,
and b) just about all the Labor voters I know were not voting for the
Labor party but *against* the Conservatives (even the stauch Labor
supporters couldn't give me any positive reason for voting that way), 
I don't see any real significance in that.

<p>
As much as I despise Thatcher for many of her authoritarian policies,
without her the British economy would still be the basket-case it was
in the seventies. She may be a borderline-psycho scumbag, but she at 
least got some things right.

<i>&gt;allow people to survive. </i><br>

<p>
Where are you going to get that money from? Or will the doctors and nurses
work for free?

<p>
<i>&gt;Free</i><br>
<i>&gt;Education will also be provided (education leads to raised output and higher</i><br>
<a href="2372.html#2383qlink4">&gt;GNP's as well as lowering reproduction), </a><br>

<p>
I'm glad to see you're going to get the teachers to work for free too. Oh, 
or do you mean "Education funded by stealing money from the rest of the 
population"?

<p>
<a name="2433qlink1">Anyway, this discussion is moot: looks like year-2000 bugs will take down 
what's left of British socialism, thank "Bob".
