<a name="3504qlink1">It depends on what you call winning. In our own Revolutionary War, we lost every
major battle save two: Bennington and the last one, if you only go by such bean
</a>counting concepts like 'body counts', and even by older standards which counted
who occupied the land afterward. Battles which we technically call victories in
Vietnam, like LZ X-Ray, where we imposed five times more casualties</a> on the enemy
than we had, taught the Vietnamese how to fight modern airmobile forces with
nothing but grenades, rifles, and mortars. I personally do not count any battle
where we did not stay and occupy the land as a victory. That we were aliens who
had no reason to occupy the land, in the eyes of the people there, basically
doomed us, and the PR campaign mounted by the NVA in our own media was also a
battle we lost, which was the most important one of all.

I don't think I even need to mention the Vietnamese's earlier experience at Dien
Bien Phu, do I?
