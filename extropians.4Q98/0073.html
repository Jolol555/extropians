  That should read, "doctor-prescribed drugs," which would  
  include conventional over-the-counter meds. Much more:

<p>
  From a University of North Carolina webpage [1] we 
  learn that "Approximately 8% of all hospital admissions
   in the U.S. are due to adverse reactions to synthetic
   drugs," which comes to "a minimum of 2,000,000" 
  people. So not only do over 2 million suffer adverse 
  effects from drugs in hospitals, of which 100,000 will 
  come out dead, but around 2 million people are going 
  into hospitals due to adverse reactions to conventional, 
  synthetic drugs. The cited UNC page goes on to say that:

<p>
    "...at least three times as many people are killed 
<pre>
     in the U.S. by pharmaceutical drugs as are killed 
     by drunken drivers. Thousands die each year from 
     supposedly 'safe' over-the-counter remedies. Deaths 
<a name="0076qlink1">     or hospitalizations due to herbs are so rare that 
     they're hard to find. The U.S. National Poison 
     Control Centers does not even have a category in 
     their database for adverse reactions to herbs."
 
</a>
    "Similar figures apply in the United Kingdom, and 
     even hepatoxicity, where perhaps the strongest 
     case against some herbs lies, the statistics are 
     horrendously clear - over 80% of cases of fulminant 
     hepatic failure presenting for liver transplant (or 
     death) over ten years in the UK were due to poison-
     ing by freely available OTC non-prescription NSAID's, 
     such as paracetomol and aspirin. Not one case was 
     due to ingestion of medicinal herbs." 

</pre>
<p>
  The Life Extension Foundation [2] reports that "FDA approved
   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs kill about 75,000 
  Americans a year," which should include both prescription
  and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
  Many of those deaths are caused by internal bleeding. Yet
  in the media today you'll be hearing much more about the
  few cases of people getting a sick-stomach from herbs than 
  the millions made ill and tens of thousands killed by FDAapproved
   drugs. The obvious reason for the great concern 
  over the minuscule and disregard for mass death is that 
  the minuscule problem (herb side effects) is a part of 
  an area (alternative medicine) that many want to be 
  brought into government control; thus an effective 
  pretext for building public support for such control 
  is to promote through the media a state of herb-panic.

         <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm</a> 

                - the critics are raving -

          "Shouldn't this be expunged?...[since]
         it is spreading fear and suspicion of the 
        government."  Lesly Sthal (CBS - 60 Minutes)

       Call the police! Newsday reports that "another 
       site linked to Goddard's" is linked to another 
       site that "pictures a woman's bare derrierre." 
        BTW, I'm still (drool) looking for that site

        On CNN, a  Federal official  said Goddard's 
         TWA 800 inquiry has caused "real damage." 
          ergo: stopping Goddard = damage control

             GIVING THE BIG LIE A BLACK EYE WITH 
               THE FIST OF ANALYTICAL INQUIRY
