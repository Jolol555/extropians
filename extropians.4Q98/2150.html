<p>
There are no facilities close to North Carolina, but there are none close to
Houston, where I live, either.  Part of what the cost of your membership in
Alcor (and presumably other organizations) buys is the mechanism that has been
developed for servicing members who live beyond the local Phoenix area.  Your
Alcor bracelet or pendant contains minimal emergency first aid information
about beginning the suspension process and, more important, a telephone number
to be called that will trigger immediate response from Alcor's suspension
teams.  The people at Alcor will literally spring into action to guide the
first steps of the suspension remotely, and will be at the scene within hours
at most.  The first steps that are taken before they arrive are designed to
minimize ischemia as much as possible.

<p>
Of course, if your death results from a degenerative or otherwise predictable
disease, many steps can be taken ahead of time to get equipment pre-positioned
and local aid prepared for the initial steps in the suspension process.
Making your personal physician aware of your cryonics arrangements goes a long
way toward ensuring that this will be done.

<p>
Many suspensions have been performed on Alcor members who lived far away from
Arizona (or before that, California).  Many of those were done according to
the then state of the art.  Recent advances and ones which we can reasonably
expect in the near future continue to improve the freezing process, from the
time of death through the eventual complete suspension at liquid nitrogen
vitrification temperatures.  So, the future looks bright: Join it!
