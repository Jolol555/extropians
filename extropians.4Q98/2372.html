<a href="2342.html#2372qlink1">&gt;Amen!  I would love to see a rational defense of socialism by some of</a><br>

<a name="2394qlink1"><a name="2377qlink2">basic assumptions:

<OL>
<a name="2378qlink2">  <li>  Human nature is such that all people try to benifit</a> themselves (and to a
<a name="2394qlink2"><a name="2385qlink2"><a name="2377qlink3">lesser extent their friends/relatives) as much as possible.</a>
  <li>  'Property' does not actually exist and is merely a way</a> of saying 'I deny
</a>
<a name="2394qlink3"><a name="2377qlink4">you access to this'.
<a name="2385qlink3"><a name="2378qlink3">  <li>  Sufficient social/monetary inequality leads to social disruption.</a></a></a>

Capitalists tend to forget point (2) and focus on point (1)</a></a>
</a>
<a name="2378qlink4">(3) tends to cause problems in capitalist societies</a> on an internal basis (in
<a name="2377qlink5">the UK, under more capitalist policies the percentage</a> difference between the
<a name="2377qlink6">rich and the poor went up by about 7% over the 10 years</a> the conservative
<a name="2383qlink1"><a name="2377qlink7">party was in power.</a>  This caused large amounts of social unrest,
demonstrations<a name="2383qlink2"> and the biggest landslide in living history for their
opposition</a> party).
<br>
<a name="2394qlink5">(3) tends to cause problems for communist societies on an</a> external basis

<a name="2377qlink8">(When the Soviet Republics realised how much better</a> of Western Europe was

<a name="2394qlink6"><a name="2378qlink6">A fourth point is sometimes useful to remember.

(4) Homo Sapiens is a pack animal that naturally speaking has</a> a heirarchy.

<a name="2394qlink8"><a name="2377qlink12">it is looking out for them.  It is a mistake to indulge this</a> too much, but
</a>
<a name="2394qlink9"><a name="2377qlink13">it is worth bearing in mind.</a>

<a name="2394qlink11"><a name="2377qlink15">mix them sluightly, taking into account of both (1) and (2)</a> which gives...

socialism.

<p>
<a name="2377qlink16">My preferred method of socialism would be to provide free</a> Gealth Care (of a
<a name="2377qlink17">standard necessary to get people back to work) and enough</a> of a handout to
<a name="2394qlink12"><a name="2377qlink18">allow people to survive.  This handout should _not_ be means</a> tested (if it
</a>
<a name="2377qlink19">drops as they start earning here is less incentive</a> to start earning).  Free
<a name="2377qlink20">Education will also be provided (education leads to raised</a> output and higher

</a>

I look forward to hearing objections.
