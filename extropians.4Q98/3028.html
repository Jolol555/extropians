<p>
You have entirely missed the concept of corruption.  The corporations
may be corrupt.  Greed exists.  However, you believe that governments,
especially in third world countries actually care for their
populations.  Many third world countries are at least as corrupt as
the US, and in many cases they are more so.  The central point here is
that you believe government, which is a monopoly over the access to a
geographical region known as a nation state, is a relatively benign. 
I conclude from your statements to this point that you think
corporations are the ultimate evil in the world.  There are evil and
greedy people in all facets of life.  However, government permits the
power of those greedy people under its name to remain unchecked.  In
the example that Samael pointed out, regardless of the validity, the
government's monopoly over its nation permits its officers to take
bribes for personal gain.  Ask yourself why you believe that people in
government are more ethical than those in the private sector.
