<a name="1595qlink1">Nobody knows. Somebody suggested that random quantum fluctuations would be
enough to make them instantly diverge but if things were really that delicate nobody
would have a stable personality, but they do. Besides the human brain is a hot noisy
place, I don't see how quantum effects could play much of a part in its operation. I don't
know how long they would stay in parallel, I would guess a few minutes,
perhaps a few hours.</a></a>
