   It's great isn't it: the reason i'm here at all on this list is b.c a
copy of Damien's book, The Spike fell into my hands (god, i hope i'm not
infringing on you in any way damien, if you're reading this!?)
When i got onto the list, and found Damien here, i wrote off a note of
congrats. and thanks,
<br>
and, yes, he answered: and on a friendly tone
nice
<br>
nice to be here
<br>
