That's interesting.  Are you saying that you currently receive a New
Zealand invalid pension granted because you were medically evaluated as
mentally incompetent to earn a living?
</a>

<p>
<a name="0561qlink2">If so, do you concur with this assessment?  If you do, should this have any
bearing on our evaluation of your posts?  Presumably you do *not* concur,
given your use of the phrases `woefully inadequate' and `their social
constructions' and your startling candour in mentioning the pension.  Do
you find any conflict in your personal values in accepting money under what
therefore would be false pretences?</a>

<p>
<a name="0561qlink3">These questions are not meant as a flame - I do not know Mr Legg, and I am
genuinely intrigued by the issues raised.  Perhaps I should make clear that
over the last couple of decades I have eked out my own meagre earnings as a
writer with the aid of five arts grants from Federal and State Australian
governments, as well as a PhD scholarship from a national funding body.  I
<a name="0566qlink1">favour some kind of anarcho-socialist polity, for want of a better term, in
which a guaranteed minimum income is provided, without strings, to all
citizens.</a>  I'm made uncomfortable, however, by the idea of someone
contriving to gain such benefits by *pretending* to be either somatically
or mentally ill.  If such a misdiagnosis were imposed upon me, I hope I'd
fight it tooth and nail, rather than accepting any benefits that happened
to be entailed.</a>

<p>
<a name="0561qlink4">If Mr Legg actually *is* sufficiently mentally ill to require an invalid
pension, I apologise for the tenor of these sceptical remarks, and will
read his posts with this proviso in mind.</a>
