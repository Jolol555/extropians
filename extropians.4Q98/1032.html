<i>&gt;equal tyranny and surveillance for everyone.</i><br>

<p>
 Brin advocates surveillance in most conditions, but doesn't advocate
complete abolition of privacy or a ban on cryptography (at least he clearly
avoided those positions in his book The Transparent Society; it's easy to
imagine him changing his mind). The only steps he advocates for creating
more equality involve empowering the average person to break up existing
concentrations of power by surveillance. As long as he doesn't advocate
that the government forceably help this along (he seems to waffle on that
question), I approve of his efforts towards equality.

<p>
 As for believing anarchists are evil: "these cypherpunks were among the
most brilliant, articulate, knowledgeable, and boisterous T-cells our
society could brag about producing so far;" - page 186-187 of The Transparent
Society. He does believe cypherpunks are mistaken about the effects of
widespread use of cryptography.
