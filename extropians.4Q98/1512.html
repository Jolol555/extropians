The embedding is going to be tricky here.

Observe the shift in meaning.  Mike said that men and women have contrary
brain dominance (undefined).  Patrick asked about the impact on cognitive
style of lateralization.

<p>
My horrified yelp might have been more explicit, it's true.  :)  

<p>
But I wasn't emitting a cry of amazement at the results, but rather a
shocked cry at the original claim (as I had read it) being made by an
intelligent and informed person.  Mikey's claim didn't deal with minor
lateralisations but with DOMINANCE.  This is not well-defined, I think, but
seems to be a rough-and-ready way of indicating which hemisphere houses the
main language-processing modules, construed as the locus of awareness,
intention, self, something like that (see Gazzaniga, below).  That notion
in turn reflected the work in the 1960s on cutting the corpus callosum and
finding that each hemisphere then showed quite distinct specialties,
normally hidden by the ceaseless cross-lobe interactions of the healthy
brain.  The `left-brain' was found to be `dominant' for language use and
abstract reasoning in most humans.  Since we're such political animals, the
word `dominance' instantly blurred into a general belief about which side
of the head was in charge.... boss of the soul, as it were.

<p>
You can see how an unconsciously sexist culture quickly read this garbled
claim backward into support for its unpleasant ideology.  Traditionally,
men are rational, articulate, focussed, while women are intuitive blurry
babblers.  Wow!  Maybe that's because men are dominant in their left
hemisphere, women in their right.  U.s.w.  Meanwhile, research was indeed
showing small differences in lateralization between male and female
populations, which seemed to support that zany (and mischievous)
misunderstanding.  (It is potentially mischievous in a number of
directions.  Male supremacists can use it to shove women back inside the
house, as the Taliban do.  Varieties of feminism can use it to argue that
`women's consciousness' is holistic and sui generis.)

<p>
Actually, the differences between men and women in respect of any general
`dominance' are insignificant compared to what is held in common.  To cite
Michael S. Gazzaniga, who did much of the work on split brains, `The idea
of modularity is central to modern cognitive neuroscience...  we now see
that only the left hemisphere has the underlying brain organization which
allows for high-level consciousness and belief formation' (NATURE'S MIND,
Penguin, 121).

<p>
As for handedness and speech lateralization, Christine Temple's popular
treatment THE BRAIN (Penguin 1993) offers some useful data.  98 percent of
RHers (male and female alike, naturally) have left-hemisphere
lateralization for language.  It's more complex for LHers.
Right-hemisphere language dominance seems to be controlled by a single
allele (Annett 1985).  In any event, Milner (1974) suggested long ago that
`in left handers or ambidextrous individuals, in whom there is no evidence
of left-hemisphere damage, approx. 70 % will have left-hemisphere speech
representation' (Temple 100).

<p>
These data might now be out of date, but the only important new work I
recall reading shows that women seem to be somewhat better cross-linked
than men.  The suggestion that women are `right-brain DOMINANT', however,
is as absurd as suggesting that most women have their feet on backwards, or
perhaps that their internal organs are enantiomorphic to the male.  It is
also dangerous, since as I noted above such claims are readily conscripted
to malign ideological purposes.

<p>
Of course I do not wish to imply that anyone on this thread is arguing from
those sorts of malevolent or self-serving motives.
