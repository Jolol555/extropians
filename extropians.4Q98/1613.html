<a href="1609.html#1613qlink1">&gt; http://www.imagination-engines.com/devo.htm:</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Abstract: Contrary to the popular notion that consciousness is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; result of a noble evolutionary process, I speculate that this rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ill-defined concept and phenomenon may be the result of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fragmentation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of an otherwise completely connected and totally ~Qfeeling~R</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe. As</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; various regions of this universe topologically pinch-off from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; connection-sparse boundaries form over which sporadic and</i><br>
<i>&gt; impoverished</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; information exchange takes place.  Supplied with only scanty clues</i><br>
<i>&gt; about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the state of the external world, abundant internal chaos drives</i><br>
<i>&gt; these</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; small parallel processing islands into multiple ~Qinterpretations~R</i><br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the environment in a process we identify with perception.  With</i><br>
<i>&gt; further</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; division of these regions by insulating partitions, the resulting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; subregions activate to lend multiple interpretation to the random</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; activations of others in a manner reminiscent of internal imagery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; spontaneous invention of significance by this weakly coupled</i><br>
<i>&gt; assembly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of simple computational units to its own overall collective behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt; is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what we have grown to recognize as biological consciousness. We</i><br>
<i>&gt; thereby</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; come to view human cortical activity as a highly degraded</i><br>
<i>&gt; approximation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to the original and prototypical cosmic connectivity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; These universalist theories of consciousness always seem to have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; property that our livers should be conscious.  They are pinched off</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the rest of the universe just like our brains; they receive data</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the state of the external world as our brains do (in the case</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the liver, via chemicals in the blood); they even have a sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; model of the outside world in the sense that they try to maintain</i><br>
<i>&gt; an equilibrium that is appropriate for current conditions.</i><br>

<p>
yes i somewhat agree with you... but it's simply a problem of
terminology isn't? what they are caalling feeling and consciousness is a
rather different notion than the usual ones

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1612.html#1613qlink2">&gt; If we explain consciousness by saying that the universe is somehow</a><br>
<i>&gt; conscious, and the brain is just a pinched off piece, then we have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard time explaining why all the other pinched off pieces aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscious.</i><br>

<p>
depend what  conscious means in the context... just a matter of
definition and terminology...in the article i've proposed... the
"feeling" of the universe is just reduced to the state of physical
interactions, i can't, at this moment, see something wrong with that.

<p>
<a href="1612.html#1613qlink3">&gt; David Chalmers proposes a similar theory.  He suggests that the</a><br>
<i>&gt; universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; is filled with what he calls "proto-consciousness", every atom and</i><br>
<i>&gt; particle imbued with a little bit of this mysterious stuff.  Only when</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is combined together in the proper way does it form consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt; as</i><br>
<i>&gt; we know it.  All we have to do now, he says, is to discover the laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; which control when and how proto-consciousness combines to form true</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness.</i><br>

<p>
a priori, THIS kind of theories seem somewhat ridiculous for me too. But
i think the article i've proposed don't talk about anythink like that...

<p>
<a href="1612.html#1613qlink4">&gt; Personally I think he's just trying to sugar-coat an unpalatable</a><br>
<i>&gt; theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We can't be sure that livers and baseball's *aren't* conscious.</i><br>

<p>
 a simple matter of terminology in the proposed paper.

<p>
<a href="1612.html#1613qlink5">&gt; For all</a><br>
<i>&gt; we know, they could have a merry internal life, full of laughter and</i><br>
<i>&gt; love.  But still the idea seems ridiculous.  By saying that they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; not</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscious, they're just "proto-conscious" (and not defining what that</i><br>
<i>&gt; means), Chalmers hopes to escape derision.  But there's no more reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; to believe that they are proto-conscious than that they are conscious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's really the same idea, just dressed up nicer.</i><br>

<p>
i believe, the article i've proposed tell nothing about such things...
perhaps you should read it ;)...all these new ages things are not for me
too...
