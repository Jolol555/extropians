<p>
Actually, from what I understand, these are calculated life spans.  They
take the percentage of people dying at each age *today*, and integrate
that information to calculate a predicted lifespan.  It is how old you
would live to be if you were born today and your chances of dying at
every age remain exactly the same as they are today.

<p>
It is likely that lifespans will increase, although there are some threats
to mortality in the near future, such as antibiotic resistant bacteria,
and harmful organisms being spread by global travel.
