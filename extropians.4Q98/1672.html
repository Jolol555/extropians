    &gt;Is it a real instantiation or just a recording?<br>

You asked some other questions too but near as I can tell they all boil down to
the same thing. If an intelligent Turing machine is in a particular logical
state, that is, if it has a particular thought, and sometime much later it or
another machine finds itself in exactly the same logical state, are there two
thoughts or only one? I would say there is only one, a thought can not detect
the passage of time so that can not differentiate it. Besides, a thought should
not be held responsible the machine that happens to think it. That's why
Nietzsche's Eternal Return would not ease the sting of death for me in the
slightest even if it were proven to be correct. If I'm locked in a jail cell I
don't feel free because I can walk endlessly in a 5-foot diameter circle. Of
course in the real world we never see intelligent Turing machines in exactly the
same state.

<p>
As for consciousness, it must be an unavoidable byproduct of intelligence,
otherwise random mutation and natural selection would never have never come up
with it.

<p>
     &gt;Nobody will change their opinion as a result of this debate.

<p>
You're probably right but what the hell, it's more fun than arguing about football.
