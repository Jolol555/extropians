I'm not so sure that that's

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps logical paradoxes happen all the time but cause no trouble because</i><br>

<a href="2648.html#2657qlink5">&gt;I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says " Dear John: Be</a><br>
<i>&gt;careful with that coffee cup near your elbow, you're about to knock it</i><br>
over."
<br>
<a href="2648.html#2657qlink6">&gt;Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2735qlink1">I'm not so sure that's a good enough explanation for me...
I mean, it's possible that "nature" will prevent the observation of paradox,
</a>
<a name="2735qlink2">but it's very possible that it can't. Which is a good reason for me to
believe that it's much harder for people to send a message</a> to the past than
<a name="2735qlink3">it would be for God to give some proof of his own existence.</a>

<p>
You say that the original John will be banished to oblivion... if so, then
where does this message come from? Is it possible that he continues on his
own separate path, and that there is a new "branch" on the fractal chain (a
multiverse) or is it more likely that the paradox of the duality between
John sending the mail to himself (not to mention countless atoms having
their paths changed as a result) and John recieving the mail and therefore
having no need to prevent the spilling of his coffee and therefore causng
John to spill his coffee therefore reminding John not to spill his coffee...
etc.

<p>
I'm curious as to if our understanding of causality is applicable once the
medium of time has been become traversable. When this happens, all causes
and effects will be happening simultaneously, which makes things a bit
confusing.
