<a name="3471qlink1">The short answer is, you can't.  There are all sorts of fancy tricks you can
use to keep yourself going for a very long time, but you can't reverse
entropy.  The energy density of the universe declines until it becomes
impossible to build any sort of organized system.</a>  To survive indefinitely
you have to change the laws of physics, move to another universe, or
otherwise avoid the issue.

<a name="3471qlink2">Fortunately, it doesn't matter.  The entire big bang/inflation model has
been under increasing strain for the last two decades, as it becomes
increasingly difficult to reconcile its predictions with actual
observations.</a>  A lot of the recent 'fine tuning' of the model looks a lot
like medieval astronomers adding epicycles to epicycles.  Unless a lot of
recent observations turn out to be wrong, we are going to end up with a new
model that gives very different predictions about these issues.

The latest issue of Scientific American has some good articles on this whole
topic.
