<p>
<a name="2060qlink1">I thought I would start a new but related thread.

<p>
<a name="2062qlink1">We seem to be of agreement that the U.S. prison system is in need
of reform, I though we could share some idea's of how.

<p>
First the nature of the criminal.

<p>
Murderers in my book as you know receive rehabilitation in the form
of seconal, pavunol, KCL.</a>

<p>
Violent criminals I'm not sure should ever be released.</a>

<p>
<a name="2060qlink2">Sex offenders only when we are sure they will not offend again,
which tends to put them in the violent class in my book.</a>

<p>
<a name="2062qlink2"><a name="2060qlink3">Drug offenders do not even belong in jail, as far as I'm concerned.</a>
If society insists on making drug use a crime, this should be
handled with counciling, and community service.

<p>
I am of the belief that most of a prison sentence should be
punishment, even if that punishment consists only of being
incarcerated.

<p>
I've been thinking that the last year of a sentence should be
different. There should be extensive counciling, and work towards
job training and placement. Sort of like the civilian re-adjustment
lectures we received when leaving the military.</a>

<p>
<a name="2060qlink4">I don't think anyone in jail should be released unless they are at
least GED equivalent. And certainly basic literacy is a must. I
think any other programs should tend to be voluntary, to encourage
people to see the benefit of correct decision making.</a>

<p>
Idea's?
