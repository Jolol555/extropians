<p>
This seems like a fine idea, (presuming I didn't mind, in this example,)
<a name="2889qlink1">but doesn't the concept of a PPF sort of undermine the whole point of
anarcho-capitalism?  I mean, this is my real problem/question.  If there's
only one PPF making the laws, how can we expect the laws to be formed
fairly under legal market principles?</a>  Isn't the PPF a government at this
point?  (This was Nozick's argument.)
