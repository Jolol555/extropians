<p>
Following the recent discussions on the list I have been wondering about
media and the influence it has on us.

<p>
Therefore I thought about what media influences that I could remember has
had an influence on my life.
<br>
- The first thing I remember is Gerald O'Neils "Spacestations" (Directly<br>
translated from danish but you should know which one I mean).
<br>
- The second was an article in Analog with an introductionary article about<br>
Nanotech. Naturally I was pretty amused that Drexler also had appeared In
"spacestations" as O'neils helper.
<br>
- A third thing was Wired magazine, with a lot of positive and futuristic<br>
articles.

<a name="1912qlink2"><a name="1905qlink3"><a name="1872qlink1">Maybe tv isn't a good media for spreading futuristic positive memes at all,
or is that simply because I havn't seen the right shows?</a></a></a>

<p>
I do believe that it is a partly the tv-medias fault, as it isn't
particularly fit to deep and thorough concepts.

<p>
Probably we should concentrate about spreading our memes in other media like
magazines, books and off course the Internet.
