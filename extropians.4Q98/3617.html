Funny thing... I was thinking next year was going to be *1999*, but I suppose
it must actually be *999*, at least going by items such as this one:

Erasing 'God' on computers is OK, rabbi rules

BNEI BRAK, Israel (December 29, 1998 12:39 p.m. EST
<a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) -
<br>
A leading Orthodox rabbi has ruled the word "God" can be deleted from a
computer screen or disk, because pixels do not constitute real letters. 

<p>
Rabbi Moshe Shaul Klein published his ruling this week in Mahsheva Tova, a
computer magazine aimed at Orthodox Jews. 

<p>
Klein was responding to a question from a reader who was anxious about whether
the ban on erasing the variations on the word "God" applied to computers. 

<p>
The rabbi, prominent in ultra-Orthodox circles in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei
Brak, ruled that the letters may be erased. 

<p>
"The letters on a computer screen are an assemblage of pixels, dots of light,<br>
what have you," the rabbi's assistant, Yossef Hayad explained to The
Associated
<br>
Press on Tuesday. 

<p>
"Even when you save it to disk, it's not like you're throwing anything more<br>
than a sequence of ones and zeroes," Hayad said. 

<p>
According to Jewish law, printed matter with the word - "elohim" in Hebrew,
and
<br>
its manifestations in any other language - must be stored, or ritually
buried. 
<br>
The existence of the magazine - a pun that means both "Good Computer" and
<br>
"Worthy Thinking" - reflects the growing incursion of modern implements into<br>
the world of the ultra-Orthodox
