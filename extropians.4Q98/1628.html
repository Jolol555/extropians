Currently I'm more interested in marketing my security skills as a
career.  I have been involved in lots of interesting things, but the
real question is how to market it.  How to make a full-time job out of
it, and how to make lots of money doing it.

<p>
My experience with my own company have not been as lucrative as I would
like.  I have since found that I can do much better by letting a big
company like IBM market security, and then hand me the engagements when
they are contracted.  This frees me from marketing, and lets me do the
real work for real money.

<p>
The market right now, is the market itself.  That is, companies trying
to make money on the Internet are the largest-growing Internet segment,
and they have the most money as well.  The more money they make, the
more targetted they are, and the more money they will spend on security.

<p>
I see a lot of cyberpunk interest on this and other lists, but I find
few people actually doing it.  And like with any job, the glamour
quickly fades when you face the day-to-day reality of having a full-time
job and following every project to completion.  I find few people able
to make the transition from wanna-be, to actual practitioner.
