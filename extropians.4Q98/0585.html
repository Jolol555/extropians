 Microsoft as a monopoly is bad for the general technology, although
better for the diffusion of technology, as they tend to heavily
concentrate on interfaces and usability.

<p>
  An exemple of bad effects? Java, corba, html, ansi C, DR DOS,
stacker... and how many others?

     I'm all for it. Open Source Software is a great chance for a new
model of development, and generally speaking as an economic model.

<p>
<a name="0663qlink1">    What do you think, you all great thinkers, about a model of economy
of abundance where the goal is not money but reputation??? (or did you
talk about it before?)</a>

1-2 more years for it to really get into the general market)
