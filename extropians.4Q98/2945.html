I'm also a part-time technical trainer, and my experience has been the
opposite. Maybe I'm lucky.

I have noticed that the average person's attention (and patience) span
seems a little constrained, but I think this is mainly an effect of current
"public" schooling with its low standards of sustained critical thinking.
If most people really were stupid, I bet we'd have more serious problems to
contend with than power-grabbing politicians and overzealous bureaucrats.

<p>
I stand by my position that Joe Six-Pack's apparent mental lassitude is not
due to inherent inability but to factors which are surmountable given the
inclination and sufficient effort.
