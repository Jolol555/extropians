The simple explanation is that people simply disagree over the value
of Wilson's writings. It should also be added that Eli tends to be a
bit... ehum... categorical.

Wilson is an intelligent man who likes to challenge traditional
thinking, and he has probably helped more people than I can count with
breaking free of constrained views of the world through his novels and
books. In this respect he is quite extropian, especially since he also
advocates a lot of the stuff we want - life extension, freedom, mental
development far beyond the human level, cryonics etc.  The problem
with Wilson is that he can be uncritical - he is always happy to play
with the latest heresy but not to scrutinize if it holds water
(instead, if pressed, he jumps to a new heresy) - and often likes to
mix serious ideas with jokes or even elaborate double-level messages
that may or may not be what he is really meaning. Tricky to decide
what he is *really* saying, and not everybodys cup of tea.

<p>
I would recommend Wilson as an eye-opener, but I wouldn't trust him as
a guide for a moment. We need critical thinking, not just wide open
minds.
