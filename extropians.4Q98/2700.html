A member of the Extropian list calling someone ELSE extreme?

<p>
Verry interesting.  An example of successful memetic infection.  

<p>
The liberal democratic politicians have apparently succeeded in "demonizing"
what at one point in our history (not too long ago) was considered normal and
desireable characteristics.  Dare we say..."family values".

<p>
I wonder if that is why the adherents to those values call themselves
"conservatives".

<p>
In one school or another I had a teacher (prof) who defined the terms
"reactionary", "conservative", "liberal", and "radical"....

<p>
Either he was looopy...or the current news media are using the terms
incorrectly.
