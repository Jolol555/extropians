'Immortality Enzyme' Is Studied

 'Immortality Enzyme' Is Studied
<br>
 By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA=
<br>
 AP Science Writer=
<p>
 	   Appearing forever young like Dick Clark is everybody's dream.
 But, biologists wonder, what good is immortality if all those extra
 years are accompanied by cancer?
<p>
 	   That's the quandary posed by the discovery earlier this year
 that a body substance called telomerase is an ``immortality
 enzyme'' that encourages cells to keep dividing indefinitely
 instead of dying with age.
<p>
 	   Scientists theorized that telomerase could be used to slow the
 aging process. At the same time, some feared that the enzyme could
 cause cancer by allowing cell division to run amok.
<p>
 	   Now, new experiments by the same University of Texas team of
 researchers have concluded that such fears are groundless.
<p>
 	   The researchers watched human cells divide hundreds of times in
 test tubes and concluded that telomerase does not by itself turn
 healthy cells into malignant ones. In fact, they said the enzyme
 may offer promising new ways to treat cancer.
<p>
 	   ``Telomerase does not cause cancer progression,'' said Woodring<br>
 Wright of the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, a co-author
 of the study, published Tuesday in the January issue of the journal
 Nature Genetics. ``The abnormalities seen in cancer are due to
 other mutations.''
<p>
 	   Other researchers said the experiment is too limited to
 exonerate telomerase.
<p>
 	   They said that while telomerase may not cause cancer by itself,
 it appears to play a fundamental role in the growth of cancerous
 cells, even if the cancer itself is triggered by, say, radiation or
 a virus.
<p>
 	   ``There is no simple statement that telomerase is irrelevant to<br>
 cancer,'' said Ronald DiPinho of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute
 of Harvard University. ``It's a very complex subject.''
<p>
 	   Thomas Cech, a 1989 Nobel laureate and biochemistry professor at
 the University of Colorado, said the Texas researchers looked only
 at the effects of adding telomerase to a normal cell, not what
 happens when telomerase is blocked in a cancer cell.
<p>
 	   A year ago, Wright and colleague Jerry Shay published research
 demonstrating that telomerase enables cells to keep on dividing and
 avoid the normal process of aging and death.
<p>
 	   Normally, human cells divide about 75 times over a lifetime. But
 each time a cell divides, the telomere, or the protective end of a
 chromosome, erodes. Eventually, the telomere becomes too short to
 protect the chromosome. When that happens, the cell can no longer
 divide and eventually dies.
<p>
 	   By the time a person is an adult, most of their healthy cells no
 longer contain any telomerase. But 90 percent of cancer cells have
 been found to have telomerase, raising suspicions that telomerase
 is linked to cancer.
<p>
 	   In test-tube experiments, Wright and Shay showed that normal
 cell death can be avoided by inserting a gene that instructs the
 cell to produce telomerase.
<p>
 	   As of late December, the cells had divided as many as 220 times
 beyond their typical lifespan, and none exhibited cancerous traits
 such as abnormalities in chromosomes, the researchers said.
<p>
 	   At least a dozen pharmaceutical companies are in the early
 stages of developing drugs that would shut down telomerase and
 starve cancer of the tumor growth substance critical to its
 survival.
<p>
 	   Telomerase also is being considered for use in unclogging blood
 vessels, restoring circulation involved in some forms of blindness,
 and accelerating the healing of skin grafts.
