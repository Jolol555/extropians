<p>
Politics is interhuman relations, just as TCP/IP is a protocol by which means
individual computers communicate. A computer by itself has no need of TCP/IP,
just as an individual hermit (RObinson Crusoe) has no need of politics. When one
individual meets another, and they interact on an ongoing basis, a protocol to
exchange data is needed. This is politics. The difference between socialism and
libertarianism is like the difference between the network concepts of
server/client versus distributed networking. A Mainframe is like a Socialist
State, and the people are mere terminals, while a Libertarian Network is all PC's
interconnected and sharing data on an equal basis.
