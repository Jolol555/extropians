<a name="0913qlink1"><a name="0912qlink1">Me, probably.  I think I remember that the reporter mentioned that she</a> had

done another member interview, but I can't recall whether she said that one
was in Houston.</a>  It's always hard to tell how a finally edited television
<a name="0918qlink2">piece will turn out from the interview (I've had hatchet jobs done on the
cutting room floor), but the reporter, Theresa Rodriguez, seemed genuinely
interested and to not have a negative slant on the subject.</a>  She was headed to
<a name="0918qlink3">Phoenix after our interview, so there will likely be some shots of the Alcor
facility and some talking heads (ugh) from there, as well.</a>

<a name="0918qlink4">I'm overseas this week, but my wife intends to tape the piece when it airs.
In true transhuman fashion, in case of technical snafus, I'd appreciate a
back-up from any local Textropians.</a>
