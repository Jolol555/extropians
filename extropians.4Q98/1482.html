<a href="1478.html#1482qlink1">&gt;I've got three kids, one 5 years old, one 20 months old, and one 6 weeks</a><br>
</a>
old
<br>
<a href="1478.html#1482qlink2">&gt;(sleep is a commodity).  Nathan, my 5 year old son, started attending a</a><br>
<i>&gt;private school this year.  Each student in his class had to present a "Me</i><br>
<i>&gt;Board" which included information about the student's family, interests,</i><br>
and
<br>
<a href="1478.html#1482qlink3">&gt;future plans.  My wife and I constantly discuss topics related to</a><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism in front of the children.  In addition, we've got books</i><br>
<i>&gt;scattered all about the house. Nathan periodically picks up a book that has</i><br>
<i>&gt;a visually interesting cover and asks what its about.  I try to give him an</i><br>
<i>&gt;adequate summary of the books ideas.  Anyway, he and I were putting his "Me</i><br>
<i>&gt;Board" together and I asked him about his future plans.  One of his future</i><br>
<i>&gt;plans was to be immortal.  One of his other future plans was to be uploaded</i><br>
<i>&gt;into our computer at home so that he could think faster about what other</i><br>
<i>&gt;future plans he might have.  Unfortunately, I was out of town the day he</i><br>
<i>&gt;presented his "Me Board" so I was not able to see the reaction of his</i><br>
<i>&gt;classmates and teacher at his pronouncements.</i><br>

<a name="1538qlink1"><a name="1495qlink2">As part of a recent psychological evaluation of an 11 year old girl, I asked
her what she would say if she were given three wishes.  I can only recall
two
<br>
of the wishes off the top of my head:

<p>
(1)  I wish everyone in the world were atheists, and
(2) I wish I were immortal.</a>

<p>
<a name="1538qlink2">Hmmm, a transhumanist in the making.  I did find out that her parents are
atheists, but don't know about their views on life extension.  Anyway,
that's
<br>
the first time I've ever heard a child say things like that.
