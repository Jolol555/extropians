In principle you might be able to make devices capable of evolution, but
you would sacrifice performance and predictability to achieve that goal. 

<p>
According to a report on NPR a couple of months ago, this has been done.
A chip has been developed for use in A-life research that can modify its
own connections.  This produced several different chips that could meet
the criteria of success (BTW, please forgive the lack of detail, I'll
try &amp; find exact references) after several generations.  Some of the
designs
<br>
were odd in that several connections semed to serve no useful
purpose---until, when those superfluous connections were removed, the
chips no longer worked.

<p>
The researcher involved drew some interesting theological conclusions:

<p>
  Assume a Creator Who sets the starting conditions for a system,  then
lets it run along Darwinian principles of selection &amp; mutation.  If the
system runs long enough, it is possible for that system to evolve into a
tremendously complex thing which is *beyond the understanding of the
Creator &amp; beyond Its power to interact with meaningfully.*

<p>
God isn't dead, just perplexed.
