<p>
<a name="2946qlink5">Those hundreds of thousands are starving due to governmental strangulation

<p>
<a name="2946qlink8">You're betraying your ignorance of economics again.</a></a></a>

<p>
<a name="2911qlink4"><a name="2906qlink4"><a href="2820.html#2837qlink7">&gt;[1]  A company moves into a very poor country and employs it's people</a><br>
doing
<br>
<a href="2820.html#2837qlink8">&gt;horrible jobs for a pittance.</a><br>

<p>
A "horrible" job paying a "pittance" sure beats the hell out of no job and
starvation.

<p>
<i>&gt;Eventually more companies move in, they have</i><br>
<a href="2820.html#2837qlink9">&gt;to compete for labour, wages rise, quality of life rises, education rises</a><br>
<i>&gt;and the companies have to find someone else to make trainers.  Great - in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the long run.  In the short run I'd rather that we were sponsoring</i><br>
education
<br>
<a href="2820.html#2837qlink10">&gt;in these countries and making people happy now.  Even if it did mean you</a><br>
had
<br>
<a href="2820.html#2837qlink11">&gt;to pay an extra $5 for your trainers and they were made in Ohio.</a><br>

<p>
So - you're advocating sacrificing everyone's long run wellbeing for short
run (and ultimately illusory) "happiness". This is an extropian outlook, is
it?
