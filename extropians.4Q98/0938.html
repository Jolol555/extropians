A lot of us, myself included, are of the "Machinery of Freedom" by
David Freedman ilk.

<p>
"Serious, prankster political party"?  If that means what I think it
means, I like it.  After all, how could you even have a serious
Libertarian party in the representative democracy framework that we
are currently constrained by.  If I were elected into this system, I
would become the same old low-life politician type we have all come to
hate.

<a name="0947qlink4"><a href="0922.html#0938qlink3">&gt; We will repeal five times as many laws as we pass.</a> </a><br>

<p>
This would eventually have to be a broken promise, taking into account
the mathematics and the need for new laws as we transition to
posthumanity.

<p>
I would vote for your party based on the inclusion of this one item. 
This is really all we need.
