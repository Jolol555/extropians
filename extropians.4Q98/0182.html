I find this paragraph far more sincere than the remainder of your post
which was laden with namecalling and rude affront extinquishing any
readible point.  What you lost might be on the other side of this.

it is because you have discovered them there,
drawn them up out of your soul's need for them
and dreamed them into the landscape to make it shine.
...We have dreamed all these things in our deepest lives
and they are ourselves.

It is our self we are making out there,

we shall have become the gods

who are intended to fill it."
