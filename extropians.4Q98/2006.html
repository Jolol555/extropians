True enough. Note that each of these individuals lived in states which did not have 'shall issue'
concealed weapons laws.... I'd be interested in seeing what the distribution of serial killers is in
states with liberal vs. restrictive gun laws...Since such indviduals are into control and domination
I'd guess that they would not like victims who were likely to be armed...

<p>
As to conversion of beliefs, its like I've always said,"A republican is merely a democrat who has
been mugged, and a democrat is merely a republican who has been laid off....".

<a name="2020qlink1">But back to the topic at hand. Since early interstellar voyages will tend to be very long duration
and have limited cargo capacity, wouldn't it be smart to use astronauts who are a bit sociopathic to
start with? Enduring the isolation will be a major qualification, I would guess...</a>
