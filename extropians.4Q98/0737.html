<a href="0715.html#0737qlink1">&gt;Ah, but the beauty of future technology is that it can ultimately</a><br>
<i>&gt;give the power of a whole nation, or even a world, to just one</i><br>
<i>&gt;person. A Jupiter Brain is an army of philosophers, soldiers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientists, artists and workers all by itself. It is autonomous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If a guy like Hitler can obtain the crucial technology to upload</i><br>
<i>&gt;and expand before anyone else, or at least in the early stages of</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanity, he *could* use it to kill/enslave everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;else without suffering any bad consequences. Those that will have</i><br>
<i>&gt;these technologies first will almost by definition be the rich and</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful (the leaders of corporations and government agencies</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc.) These people have certainly not been selected for high moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;standards, but rather for ruthlessness, love of power and</i><br>
<i>&gt;determination. Natural selection. Now, this is not a reason to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;depressed or something, but rather... (you know what).</i><br>

<p>
This was the theme of a screenplay I was working on with a young
Tejano writer a couple of years ago, who I've unfortunately lost
track of.

<p>
essential plot follows:

<p>
"The head of a a large corporation who's organic body is dying
develops the ability to upload. During the procedure his HQ is
attacked by a radical group that opposes his corporate policies.

<p>
The group being techno-savvy realizes that information is more
important than mere physical infrastructure, attacks with an
explosive pumped EMP device. So while they do considerable physical
damage they do massive informational damage.

<p>
Yep, they interupt the uploading (while destroying the original).
While his intelligence is successfully uploaded, the procedure is
interupted while subroutines establishing mimic functions of the
glandular functions are being created.

<p>
Result? A demented upload, who then decides the vast majority of
humanity are unnecessary and sets about creating a virus to destroy
those he doesn't like, while secretly trying to protect those he
does like.

<p>
Lots more interesting stuff...
