<a name="2313qlink3">Perhaps you should clarify why this is exactly gibberish.</a>  Although I agree,
that a clear cut black and white distinction between so called "right-brained"</a>
thinking and "left brained" thinking has since been show to be imprecise in
describing actual localized brain activity, as a "model" it's hard to argue
that there aren't different modes of conscious and intelligent experience.
Does it matter as much then, what part of the brain these types of thinking
are taking place?  Personally I could care less.  Your going to have hard time
convincing me that the cogitation I use while juggling is the same as when I
solve a mathematical equation or compose a poem.  Unless you haven't
experienced the "highs" of marijuana or LSD, your also going to have hard time
convincing me that such psychedelic states are qualitatively the same as what
I am experiencing while driving my car to work.

<a name="2338qlink1"><a name="2313qlink4">Since you seem to be suggesting that models of intelligence positing the
existence of brain states beyond the conventional linear styles of thinking
are gibberish, what are your alternatives?</a></a>
