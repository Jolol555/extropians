<a name="1678qlink1">Long-lasting bulbs already exist on the market.

<p>
I've lived in my house for five years, and in all that time none of
the lightbulbs in our family room have burned out.  We spend all our
evenings in that room, and the lights are on from sunset until about
11 PM, every night.

<p>
That's probably 10,000+ hours on those bulbs.  There are 8 bulbs in
recessed ceiling fixtures, of the floodlight type, and all of them
are still going strong.  I wish I knew where the former owner bought
them (and when he did!).
