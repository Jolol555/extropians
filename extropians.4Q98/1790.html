<a name="1900qlink1"><a name="1896qlink1">Could the Nucleus Accumbens be transplanted from an old man, to his 
cryonically suspended twin?</a></a>

<p>
For example, my uncle, Mark Howard Riegel, is now 54 years old.  He 
is very sick at this moment.  He's fought several bouts of severe 
opression, and become very heavy.  Now he has a serious case of heart 
disease. 

<p>
<a name="1900qlink2"><a name="1896qlink2">If he had been cloned, or if his zygote had been pulled into several 
cell clusters, and some of them had been cryonically suspended (prior 
to his placement into my grandmother, Melva's, uterus), would there 
be hope for Mark's "reincarnation", by placing his "experiened" 
quantum interfaced nucleus accumbens into one of his twins?</a></a>

<p>
For example, he's born in 1944, but his anencephalic identical twin 
is born born in 1971, and kept on life support to this date.  If Mark 
dies sometime this week, could Mark be brought back as a 27 year old? 
 Physically, he'd appear to be at half life, but emotionally and 
intellectually, he'd have his full life's experience, right?
