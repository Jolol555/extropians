Mainly because they have been unsuccessful in bucking social pressure
against their activities.</a> The pot smoker that suffers bouts of paranoia
is a case in point. Were it not for the stigmatization caused by the
phony War On Drugs the paranoia would be expressed as something
altogether different. Similarly the nasty attractor state of getting
caught repeatedly in sessions of bookkeeping or say religious ceremony
is never seen for the complicity blinding social illness that it is.
These illnesses are real but are manifested by the great clobbering
machine made up of your so-called normals. Can you say 'tall poppy
syndrome'?
