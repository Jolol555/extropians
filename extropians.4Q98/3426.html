<p>
Not really.  I have no problem with assigning probabilities close to
one.  When I refer to a "strong belief", I am referring to a cognitive
event over and above that involved in having a statement about
probabilities; I think that the best phrasing I can apply now would be
that a "strong belief" means that you care.  I have a pretty good
probability that the sky is blue, but if it was orange, so what?  By
contrast, many people would be deeply disturbed to learn that there
is/is not a God.  They probably assign roughly the same probability to
the two statements "sky is blue" and "my religion is correct", but the
behaviors of the beliefs differ.  Strong beliefs are "sticky"; it's hard
to change them.

<p>
Let's take my own belief that "strong beliefs are bad" as a case in
point.  If I had a strong belief that "strong beliefs are bad", I
wouldn't be able to consider circumstances under which "strong beliefs
are good".  It may well be that having a strong belief activates various
cognitive abilities, particularly social abilities, but possibly even a
different type of search for evidence, or an expanded search for effects
caused by the believed-in object.

<p>
So I think people should train themselves out of strong belief, but I
would anathematize any attempt to neurosurgically disable the "strong
belief" capability... without a much better idea of what's going on,
anyway.  This is not something I would say if I had a "strong belief",
even though I still think the probablility that a strong belief will
screw you up in any given situation is close to 1 (except in
deliberately constructed special cases).
