I'm in the process of adding links to the Adventurous Traveler Bookstore
that sells books and cd-roms online to my website as part of their
revinue sharing program.  I've bought a few products from them in the
past and they have good quality stuff, mostly travel and travel/outdoors
related books, plus CD-ROMS that are mostly mapping resources, though I
did buy "The Art of Fly Tying" on CD-ROM. For those of you interested in
making a positive cash flow off of your website, here are the details
(note: I am making no money off of referring you, so don't look at this
as a spam):

<p>
Dear Mr. Lorrey,
<br>
Thanks for your interest in the program.  Here are the details.  If you
would like to become a member please go to the following page and fill
out
<br>
the information. <a href="http://209.130.4.164/atbook/">http://209.130.4.164/atbook/</a>


<p>
-A 12% cash commission will be paid on the first month of orders placed<br>
through the Adventurous Traveler Bookstore. * This one month commission
rate is a one time offer, you cannot leave ATB and come back and receive

<p>
another months rate at 12%.

<p>
-A 6% cash commission will be applied on every order after that first<br>
month of sales. Or you can accrue 12% store credit.  Which can be
applied
<br>
to orders you place at any time with us.

<p>
-We base our commission on the full price of our titles and include the<br>
backordered items when they are back in stock. *ATB figures your
percentage from the full retail price of the book. *ATB processes
backorders daily.

<p>
-Commisions do not apply to ATB Gift Certificates, ATB Book Club<br>
Memberships or Rare and Out-of-Print titles available on our site.

<p>
-Checks and reports will be sent out to you on a quarterly schedule.<br>

<p>
Three different ways to link to ATB.
<br>
-Regular ATB banner that will link directly to the ATB home page.<br>
-You may link the product that is on your page directly to the product<br>
in
<br>
the ATB shopping cart. -You may also pick a banner pertaining to the
content on your page and have the link go directly to that category on
the
<br>
ATB page.  ie. if you are www.mikesbikepage.com you may choose to have a

<p>
banner that will directly link to our activity page that shows all of
the
<br>
titles on biking.

<p>
Banner Location and choices.
<br>
-Atleast one banner must be present on the home page of an ATB<br>
Affiliate.
<br>
-Upon requesting information, you will receive a selection of banners to<br>

<p>
choose from.  If none of these work out with your page, you may submit
an
<br>
idea you have for a banner to us.



<p>
I look forward to hearing back from you.

<p>
Best Regards,

<p>
Erich Finley

I'd like to set up links from my website to yours for this purpose.
Since I've bought a couple of products of yours in the past, I could put

<p>
up reviews of these with links to your site.

<p>
Mike Lorrey
