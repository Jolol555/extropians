Maybe its time to research the bible to see if there is any clue as to
how many watts that eternal flame is ;-)  I suppose, even if its only
a single measly watt, as long as the population is finite, you could
experience an infinite subjective time after all.  So what if it takes
a couple billion years for one day to pass.  You'll still be doing
better than the do gooders, provided Tipler is wrong.

<a name="0785qlink2">Apparently jokesters are only willing to go so far.  Sadly, $20,000
has not made its way into my account :-( come on td, you elcheapo.  I
extend the deadline to the end of this week and reduce the amount to
$10,000.  Because you seem to be a fully badged employee, delivery to
my office in legal tender is acceptable.  Make the envelope somewhat
obscure or I'll never find it in this messy cubicle.  td,</a> you are the
bestest.
