I am seeking to hire an individual to conduct activities for a lab 
that is creating animal models of learning and memory -- generating
knock-out constructs, as well as, utilizing molecular biology
skills to perform Cloning, Plasmid and Phage Preparation, PCR,
making cDNA Libraries, Library Screening, Southern and Northern
Blot Analyses, Western Blotting.  Good communication and
organizational skills are a plus.  A likely candidate would possess
a B.S., M.S. or MD degree. I represent a leading bio-tech company
with research facilities in New York and can provide excellent
benefits (health insurance, dental, and vision plan, paid vacation
and more). A high impact, high profile position with excellent
opportunity for advancement.
