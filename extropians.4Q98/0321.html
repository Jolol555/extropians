Acceleration implies measurement, but it doesn't imply much more in in the
way of measurement than "progress", or "development" do. If you can
measure the current level of "civilisation", then two measurements
separated by time yields a (rough average) measure of "progress",
and a sequence of measurements over time yields "acceleration."
(OK, to be horribly pedantic, the forward differences of the forward
differences, suitably adjusted, are the average acceleration :-)

<p>
Sure, we can argue over our measures of the current level. We can agree
that each of our measures is at best a rough proxy that may correlate
to the level of "civilization." The point is that essentially all of
our objective or quasi-objective proxies show exponential growth.
The only way to avoid the conclusion of acceleration is to appeal
to more subjective measures or to appeal to speculative constraints.
OK, the constraints aren't speculative: thier relevance is speculative,
as the constrants somehow always occur in the future.
