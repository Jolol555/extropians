Yes, that's all true. But...they can do this anyway.<a name="1879qlink1"> Nowadays, if the 
government really wants you dead/in jail, they don't even have to take 
the trouble to drop your DNA on the scene or mess with videotape;
they just "discover" some dope on your property and than it's your
word against that of the cops. Or they just arrange an "accident".
No high tech needed there either.</a>

<a name="1865qlink1">Now, enter the surveillance system. All data is stored at separate
places (multiple redundancy) and for cross-referencing. When trying
to fake evidence, one would have to break into *all* the encrypted
databases (in underground vaults)<a name="1960qlink4"> and change *all* the relevant data
(the nasty thing is that seemingly unrelated data can nonetheless
</a>
serve to check the validity of primary data).<a name="1960qlink5"> This is a very tough job
</a>
to do right, and in my scenario various civil rights (non-government)
organizations and government agancies would have joint control
over the databases, breathing down eachothers neck all the time,
checking for every possible irregularity.<a name="1960qlink2"> Imagine cops with cams
integrated into their uniforms, their cars, their guns etc., 
</a>
monitored by the people and government alike. I bet the level of
authority abuse would drop drastically.
