The last show that really changed some fundamental 
ideas I had was PBS's "The Glorious Accident", now 
available as a boook.  Here's the description:

The Glorious Accident

<p>
by Wim Kayzer

<p>
Kayzer envisioned gathering together a group of 
renowned thinkers to discuss the all-encompassing 
question of what it is that we know about why we are 
here. He met individually with Oliver Sacks, Stephen 
Jay Gould, Daniel Dennett, Freeman Dyson, Rupert 
Sheldrake, and Stephen Toulmin, then gathered the 
group together for a discussion. By the time they had 
finished, they had addressed the nature of 
consciousness, what people derive most from 
consciousness -- knowledge or understanding, and 
such personal questions as what fascinated panel 
members as children and what drives them today.

Maybe available in video at your local library.  Also
greatly agree with Cosmos, Connections, The Ascent 
of Man(kind), and of course Pee Wee's Playhouse.   ;-)
