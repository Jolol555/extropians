A large part of scientific disagreement stems from the fact that many
scientists put science before politics.

  <li>  Britain urged to end cloning ban

LONDON (AP) - To keep up with advances in the U.S., Britain should
permit research into the cloning of human embryos to create
replacement organs, a government panel of scientists recommended
Tuesday. The commission said Britain should maintain its ban on
cloning to create babies, but some scientists condemned the panel's
findings, saying they would open the door to the cloning of complete
human beings. The panel of British scientists said American successes
in growing "master cells" of human tissues from an embryo have huge
potential for new medical treatments, possibly even the eventual
creation of replacement hearts and other organs.
