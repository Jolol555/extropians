Well, no, actually, I don't.  That's why I keep my business interests diversified, 
and why I don't count on them to do anything truely vital.

<p>
&gt; Why should cryonics be an<br>

<p>
Because the cost of failure is much higher than the examples you gave.  The 
closest analogy would be a hospital, and whenever someone I care about is in 
one I watch them like a hawk.  I don't *ever* want to be in one without someone 
I know and trust to look after my interests.
