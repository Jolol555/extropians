My hunting cabin is on paper company land, which we've leased for 35 years.
Owners have come and gone, first Brown Paper, then International Paper, then a
couple others, now its Mead Paper. I hunt and fish all through this land, which
is regularly logged. Some is left fallow to grow back slowly, while other areas
are replanted, typically on hillsides. The diversity of cover between the
logged and unlogged areas provides just the sort of cover that deer, coyote,
rabbit, grouse, and other species love. We have more deer living in NH now than
in colonial times, because there is a diversity of covers, not just constant
old growth everywhere..
