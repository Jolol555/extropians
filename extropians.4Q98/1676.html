So can<a name="1692qlink1"> I. Green is defined as a general band of monochromatic light
</a>
wavelengths. A 'pure' green is a source of light which is emits completely
in one or more of these wavelengths.<a name="1679qlink1"> If Green did not exist, then there
would be a gap in the spectrum which would be physically impossible  for any
matter in this universe to emit photons in. Since there is no such gap, then
therefore green exists.</a>

<p>
Saying that green does not exist merely because you cannot see it is rather
subjectively circular. Its like asking a deer if the color red exists. Since
a deer does not have cones in its eyes which can detect light peaking in the
red band, the the deer would not consider the color 'red' to exist, which is
why the color 'blaze orange' (defined as 574-605.5 nm) is such an effective
safety color for hunters to use.... As far as the deer is concerned,  red
wavelengths either show up as a dim yellow, or not at all.
