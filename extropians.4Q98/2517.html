I think that's pretty clear from the contradictory and inconsistent posts
from the various socialists who've recently arrived on the list.

Voluntary transhuman socialism is perfectly possible, for small groups in
the short term; in fact I'd say it's not only possible and consistent with
anarcho-capitalism, but in many cases may be the most effective way for
small affinity groups to operate. Large-scale involuntary transhuman 
socialism is impossible, because it requires that some group take control 
of a society where any one individual can wipe out a large group which 
annoys it. Coercion is hard in a transhuman society,<a name="2523qlink1"> and transhuman tech 
is hard to build in a socialist society; the whole aim of socialism is
to reduce the rate of change and create a static society.
