<i>&gt; And to add more Catholic trivia that you never wanted to know, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Immaculate Conception refers not to the conception of Jesus, but to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conception of Mary.  That is, Mary herself was conceived miraculously,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not through sexual relations, and her conception (the moment when</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mary's mother became pregnant) is called the Immaculate Conception.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The conception of Jesus is apparently called the Holy Conception, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; his birth, the Virgin Birth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although Mary was conceived miraculously, the miracle was such that</i><br>
<i>&gt; she was the biological child of both her father and her mother.  Jesus,</i><br>

<p>
I have felt the the policy of the Immaculate Conception, which was not</a> a part
<a name="2073qlink6">of catholic theology til several hundred years after the supposedly blessed
event, was merely a smokescreen by the Church to obfuscate</a> the evidence that
<a name="2073qlink7">Jesus was actually a political figure by the fact that his parents were the
culmination of a breeding program to reunite the royal houses of Isreal.
