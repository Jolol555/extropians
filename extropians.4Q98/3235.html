<a name="3335qlink1">I think it is believed that fugu intestine sushi is a uniquely 
pleasant way to take a permanent vacation from this world, that 
indeed the tetrodotoxin traces present in the rest of the fish 
tissue is an addictive drug lending a particular kick to the 
traditional Nipponese delicacy. The permanent psychic break as 
aftermath of the zombification process you described may well 
be at least partly attributable to simple brain damage: pulse 
and aspiration shallow enough to fool the coroner/M.D. and a 
few hours spent in the confines of a coffin prior to excavation 
by the priest should result to ischaemic damage of primarily 
higher cortex functions, probably wiping out a lot of the 
personality of the convict, possibly also making the zombie a 
good deal more docile. Maybe the drug administred is 
multicomponent, and includes neuroprotectants as well? 
Certain people would be sure interested...</a>

<a name="3335qlink2">I also seem to (dimly) remember an African practice of dosing
unsuspecting husbands meals with a plant poison (calabaro bean?)
resulting in permanent lossage of memory (like a Korsakoff patient?),
but I forgot all the details. Hmm, let me try to recollect what I was
going to say...&lt;snip&gt;, &lt;snip&gt;.. it's gone... huh... what...?
