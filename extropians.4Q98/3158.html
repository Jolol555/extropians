<p>
 That would work if you never communicate in ways that the government
can trace. Most people either want to continue using meatspace
communications or doubt their ability to consistently avoid mistakes
which will allow the government to trace some of their messages back
to them.

<p>
<a href="2775.html#3158qlink2">&gt;they going to arrest me by email? And evading writing style analysis is</a><br>
<i>&gt;easy, just feed your message into a program which converts it into a </i><br>
<i>&gt;standardized style, or modifies it to match someone else's.</i><br>

<p>
 It's easy to attempt, but it's hard to verify that such software works.
The more you are willing to accept some alterations of your social personality,
the more believable this approach sounds, but then it becomes harder for
most of us to believe it's worth the cost.
 Take for example you sell some software that you write under an anonymous
contract, and don't trust the buyer.
<br>
 Will the program you mention just change some variable names and
whitespace? ("Merely" interfering with the company's ability to maintain
it by obscuring your design, unless maybe the software is close to passing
the Turing test.) It isn't obvious that that will be enough to remove all
patterns. And if it tries to do more, I have doubts about it's ability to
reliably avoid introducing bugs.

<p>
<a href="2775.html#3158qlink3">&gt;&gt;It it's universal, you can find all the information you need, but you</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;have no obvious way to alter the information without someone seeing you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;perform the alteration.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And how will they prove that the video showing me modifying the data is</i><br>
<i>&gt;real and not another fake? If anyone can fake video then *nothing* can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;trusted.</i><br>

<p>
 With several independantly controlled videos showing you modifying the data,
the only thing we need to trust is that there isn't a big conspiracy to
frame you, i.e. it creates no new risks of injustice as long as people
accurately estimate the reliability of the evidence.
 Also, it's a lot easier to keep the truth consistent than it is to create
a consistent set of fakes.

<i>&gt;that shooting them is the only solution.</i><br>

<p>
 Considering the weapons they have, it's hard to imagine that shooting
them is a solution.

<p>
<a href="2775.html#3158qlink6">&gt;&gt;By the standards you are using here, almost all evidence is a joke. Are</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you arguing against using evidence, or did you have some other point in</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Video evidence is a joke. Anyone who trusts it is an idiot. No non-sentient</i><br>
<i>&gt;witness can be trusted.</i><br>

<p>
 Anyone who has religious-style faith in it is an idiot. So is anyone
who religiously rejects it.

<p>
 Setting up this straw man hardly justifies your attempt to argue that
video evidence is undesirable.

<p>
 Thses sound like good examples of why multiple cameras are better than
one.
