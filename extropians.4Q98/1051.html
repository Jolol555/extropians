<a href="1043.html#1051qlink1">&gt; For example, if you were in charge of network programming for</a><br>
<i>&gt; Baghdad metropolitan and suburban television, and had an unlimited</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply of SONY Trinitron televisions to hand out, would it be</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to convert the citizens' attitudes to some that were more</i><br>
<i>&gt; friendly to Western ideas?</i><br>

<p>
I read an estimate that this next pummeling in the Gulf will cost the
U.S. Taxpayers $5 Billion.

<p>
Wouldn't it be better to put that $5 Billion into HDTV Flat Panel Web
Terminals with Wireless Broadband.

<p>
We could take all the Trinitrons sitting in Circuit City warehouses
and send them to the Gulf.  This way, we'll be avoiding all the long
term animosity that's created when people are killed.

<p>
Sure, you can kill a Republican Guard soldier in the desert, but his
children are just going to grow up hating America.  His survivors are
more of a long term threat than he is in the first place.  Remember
all those pictures of those starving lice infected Iraqi soldiers
begging for mercy, as the U.S. robotic controlled weapons were
unleashed in a turkey shoot?  

<p>
Why not launch an all-out reprogramming effort instead?  Maybe drop
leaflets with Prozac and Ecstacy or something?  Why not do some
research before exterminating the test subjects?
