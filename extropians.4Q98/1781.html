<p>
R.U. Sirius, writer for such magazines as Mondo 2000, 21 C, and Wired has
developed a platform for running for president. R.U. is a good friend to
many of us and has a wonderful sense of humor and flare.  Although his
political interests are surely tongue-in-cheek, the Web site is a lot of fun.

<p>
"The Revolution is a new political party that aims to be the voice of the<br>
non-voter, the alienated, the visionaries, the rabble, and the Internet.
Combining left and libertarian politics with a kind of post-political
futurism and the love of a good laugh, The Revolution® intends to bring all
the subcultural tribes together to wrest control of worldwide political
systems from the drug warriors, the cultural ayatollahs, and the various
corporate mega-destructo gangs, ranging from the military-industrial
complex to the HMOs ad infinitum."

"In 1993, Sirius split from Mondo 2000. Since then, he's contributed his<br>
increasingly acerbic scribblings to publications ranging from ARTFORUM
International to Wired to Esquire Japan. In 1994, he recorded an unreleased
album called IOU Babe for Trent Reznor's Nothing Records with his
conceptual-art rock band MV Inc. (formerly called Mondo Vanilli). He has
also co-authored two books with St. Jude, Cyberpunk Handbook: the Real
Cyberpunk Fakebook (Random House), and How to Mutate and Take Over the
World (Ballantine)."
