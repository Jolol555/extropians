Sorry, nope. The 0.2% figure was cited in an article I ran across a while
ago; I'd have to do some serious digging to come up with hard figures,
and as I don't work in a library ...

<p>
One other point to note; although general crime levels in the UK
are comparable to the USA, the murder rate is an order of magnitude
lower. Don't know why: highly suspicious of attempts to pin the blame
on widespread gun ownership in the USA (as there are other high gunownership
 countries that have a much lower murder rate).

<p>
The upshot is that in the UK, you're as likely -- or more likely -- to
have your car pinched or your house burgled, but far less likely to
be assaulted or killed in the process. And interestingly, the murder
rate didn't rise significantly following the abolition of the death
penalty.
