Agreed.  I thought about the ambiguity or possible contradiction of my
statement after I made it.  I meant that in a free market system the
latter your choices would be more likely to happen.  Other customers
and competitors, seeing their very existence in jeopardy, could
boycott the offending company to drive the point home or simply put it
out of business.  The major point was that government would not be
involved in regulating the market.
