<a href="1264.html#1265qlink1">&gt;&gt; &gt;Well you better get that level of stress just right: the recent Society</a><br>
for

<a href="1264.html#1265qlink2">&gt;&gt; &gt;Neuroscience meeting suggests that childhood abuse (emotional not</a><br>
physical)

<a href="1264.html#1265qlink7">&gt;&gt; I have long suspected this to be true.  It led me to wonder . . . If we</a><br>
can
<br>
<a href="1252.html#1265qlink8">&gt;&gt; confirm this and it becomes accepted as fact, will verbal and emotional</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; abuse be punishable by the same laws which deal with physical abuse?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I used to work in a domestic violence shelter and it seemed odd to me</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that someone could be arrested and jailed for beating someone but</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; there was no penalty whatsoever for verbal/emotional abuse.  Would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you have to have a way to verify that neural damage had been inflicted?</i><br>

<a name="1318qlink1"><i>&gt;Did you know that sneezing causes permanent brain damage? If this is so,</i><br>
why are
<br>
<a href="1252.html#1265qlink9">&gt;there no laws punishing people who give other people their colds, flus, and</a><br>
<i>&gt;pneumonias? How about holding parents responsible for giving their children</i><br>
<i>&gt;predispositions for allergies? C'mon, people pull your heads out.....</i><br>

<p>
Excuse me?  I was referring to people who have an *intent to harm* and you
counter with examples that are innocuous, incidental, or unintentional?  I
have
<br>
read and enjoyed your posts and know that you can make a more rational
argument than that if you really think my head is up....

<p>
A better example might have been, what about a person who dumps their
partner cause they're mad at them and this throws the partner into a deep
depression? Harm was intended and harm was done.  Is it the perpetrators
fault? or was the partner predisposed?  You'd probably never figure this
one out.

<p>
I'm not sure where the line should be drawn, but I don't think that adults
</a>who
<br>
maliciously inflict emotional abuse which results in brain damage to
children
<br>
should be considered non-criminals simply because you can't see the
bruise.
