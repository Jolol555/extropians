Hi,

<p>
<a name="2616qlink1"><a name="2590qlink1">I am 15 and very new to the list, so perhaps its too early to participate.</a>  But a recent thread has generated quite a bit of confusion for me.  Perhaps somebody could clear it up.  I have been reading the arhives for about a month, so I know there is little all extropians agree on, but I find it interesting that books marked as recommended reading in Max More's Extropian Principles 2.6 clearly lists three books of note:
</a>

<p>
<a name="2616qlink2"><a name="2590qlink2">Robert Anton Wilson's:  Prometheus Rising.
<p>
  			The New Inquistion.
<br>
and

<p>
Timothy Leary's:  InfoPsychology.

<p>
</a></a>Why is it that some people who seem to be a prominant member on the list continue to trash as gibberish any and all information presented by other parties about Leary, and specifically his 8 circuits model in Infopsychology?

<p>
<a name="2616qlink3"><a name="2568qlink1">Having recently read Extropian goals of moving beyond dogmatic</a> types thinking, perhaps I'm guilty of dogmatic thinking myself when I point out what seems to be a rather sharp division between some peoples views of Leary and Wilson and Max More's listing them as recommeded reading.  My time is limited, so could somebody clarify what I'm missing here.</a>

<p>
Sincerly,

<p>
Steven
