The mark of effective brain washing is that the victim does not even beleive
that he or she has been brainwashed. Just as with experiments with people
having parts of their brain stimulated by instruments. The subjects all think
that the reason they do what they do in response to the stimuli was completely
their own idea, not the result of implanted instruments.
