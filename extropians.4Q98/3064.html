Harmless or not, benevolent or not, if the government doesn't ask my permission
to use my money then it is theft. The government bureaucracy has a vested
interest in expanding its purview to more an more of people's lives, since it
creates government jobs and expands the power of the bureaucrats at the top. You
think that just because they aren't shooting at me that they are not forcing me.
Any exchange with the government which I have the choice of obeying or going to
jail or paying a fine is force. Get it?
