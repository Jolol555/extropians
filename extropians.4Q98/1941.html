I actually think that this is a very good idea.  I went through a 
similar internal debate with myself over this issue before I joined ExI
when I first encountered "Understanding the Libertarian Philosophy" 
<a href="http://www.libertarian.org/libphilo.html">http://www.libertarian.org/libphilo.html</a> by Joseph Knight.  I decided 
that his formulation was close enought to my own that I began to use it 
to introduce people to the freedom philosophy.  It was the and is now 
very easy for me to perceive militant libertarianism being in favor of 
the death penalty.  I finally decided that the only way to harmonize 
the different flavors of Libertarianism on this issue was to place the 
responsibility of deciding for or against the death penalty in regard 
to a particular convicted murderer on the shoulders of the victim, 
victim's family, or those that were closest to the victim.  Now since 
the victim of a murder is, by definition, dead.  The only way to have 
it placed on the victim's shoulders is by the victim somehow 
making his wishes know before he has been murdered.  I was uncertain 
how this could be done and over the years have drifted into an ever 
stronger and more resolute pacifism.  Although your proposal, that 
seems to have arisen out of a reaction to an alternative yet opposingly
identical (positive v. negative) perspective, it appears remarkably 
rational and I would like to see this as viable (at least temporary) 
middle ground.  That way each side, both the more militant and the more 
pacifist, can discuss the issue with feeling threatened (which can make 
it more difficult to understand that another almost opposite 
perspective can rationally exist).  Although I know that Extropianism 
and Libertarianism are not exactly equivalent, I do like to think of 
Extropianism as part of the Libertarian Movement, the Erisian Movement, 
and the broader Transhumanist Movement.  I do not perceive the death 
penalty as being a particularly Extropian idea, but I think that the
middle ground implied by respecting the victim's wishes can and 
probably should be considered to have enough rational support to 
justify tolerating the wishes both of more militant individuals (like 
Brian) and more pacifist individuals (like myself) on this issue (at 
least for the time being ;) .
