its more than a vague sense fred.  i have tried to gently explain to people
that i am a former christian now atheist.  they seem utterly baffled that
such a thing is even possible.  conversations can go thus:

<p>
they:  i dont understand how you can stand there and say you are an atheist.
me:  i just did.
<br>
they:  but if that is true, why would you not just go out without any moral
constraint and do exactly whatever you want?
me:  i am doing exactly whatever i want.
they:  no i mean, why dont you just go and just sin like crazy.
me:  because i am sane.   i am without religion, not without morals.
they, still not getting it:  so, are you part of some... cult or something?
me, with a blank stare:  we...are...not...a...cult.
they...are...my...friends.

<p>
that last bit works if they have any sense of humor, which is seldom
the case when dealing in religious topics...  {8^D spike
