I have just sent this letter to Richard Seed. His e-mail adresses are
ljseed@pol.net and seed@interaccess.com (source:
<a href="http://www.humancloning.org/seed.htm">http://www.humancloning.org/seed.htm</a>). 

<p>
Dr. Seed,
<br>
I am a 21 year old college senior attending the University at Buffalo,
majoring in cognitive science. Although I disagree with certain minor
positions you have on human cloning, I am of the opinion that it is
generally a completely benign procedure and there are no moral issues
associated with it other then those associated with reproduction in general.
The attacks on human cloning are based on ignorance and fears so vague that
they can be expressed no more precisely then "deep ethical issues". I wish
you luck, and please, please, please do not give up. Accomplishing this
scientific task in the face of aggresive stupidity will set a precedent for
future scientists who are bound to face similar obsticals. I'm sure you've
heard all this before, but when I found your e-mail adress(es), I had to
write to personally thank you.
<br>
I also have a question. I read a while ago that you were in the proccess of
setting up a clinic in Japan. I only read one report of this and could find
no other source, so I would just like to verify with you that this is true.
Thank you for your time,
<br>
Zeb Haradon
