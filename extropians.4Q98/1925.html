"The Prisoner" formed my early ideas on individuality. "I AM NOT A
NUMBER, I AM A FREE MAN!", "I will not be pushed, stamped, numbered,
filed, briefed, or debriefed." are some of my favorite quotes. This show
early on illustrated to my youthful mind the threat that a world state
poses to the individual.

<a name="1956qlink1">"The Lawrence Welk Show". You didn't say it had to be a positive impact.
Today I have a hair trigger reflex against accordions and bubble

I learned about patience by being forced to watch PGA golf at my
grandparents house, while The Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom was the
first nature show I watched. Of course, being sat in fornt of the tv as
a baby to watch Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Mr Rogers
Neigborhood was probably instrumental in my early scholastic aptitude.
The first words I ever spoke apparently were the entire Alphabet Song
that Big Bird sang.
