<p>
You're talking about objects so that's obviously true.</a>

<i>     &gt;Can you show it to me?  Can you point at it?</i><br>

<p>
No I can not, adjectives don't exist in a particular point in space or a
particular instance in time.</a>


<p>
<a name="1624qlink4"><a href="1540.html#1584qlink4">     &gt;Joviality aside, we could define the One True Green to be the</a><br>
<i>     &gt;set of all green things.</i><br>


<p>
I'm not big on definitions, few are needed and even fewer are any good, your
definition of green is no exception. Even if all green things were destroyed
green might not be because that subjective experience might exist in the future.
And you can have green without green things or even green light, as in
hallucinations. Before you ask let me say that I have no definition of green,
only examples.</a>


<p>
<a href="1540.html#1584qlink5">     &gt;But is your consciousness actually correlated with the set of</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1624qlink5"><a name="1587qlink2">First of all I don't have consciousness I am consciousness. Emotions,
sensations, and thoughts are the part of me I value, not protoplasm. Second,
things are made of atoms and atoms have no individuality, if they can't even
give this interesting property to themselves how can they give it to me?</a></a>


<p>
<a name="1624qlink6"><a name="1587qlink3"><a href="1540.html#1584qlink6">     &gt;If I've got two green cubes, and smash one, what happens</a><br>

<p>
If I have two printers printing out the same novel and I smash one is the book
</a>
</a>destroyed<a name="1587qlink4"><a name="1624qlink7"> ? If I have two phonographs playing the same symphony and I smash
one machine what happens to the music?</a></a>


<p>
<a name="1624qlink8">    &gt;there is a little less Green in the world.


<p>
I've never seen that make the slightest difference in anything. The number of green
things in the universe constantly fluctuates, but it wouldn't matter if it dropped to zero.
After a billion years without green and a green thing finally evolved again it would be
just as green as it was before.</a>


<p>
<a name="1624qlink9"><a href="1540.html#1584qlink7">     &gt;I happen to think that there is no such thing as a Green; that's</a><br>
<i>     &gt;what I meant by the non-existence of Plato's heaven.</i><br>


<p>
Then you should use nothing but nouns and pronouns when you speak or write, all
other words are just gibberish. Me Tarzan you Jane.</a>
