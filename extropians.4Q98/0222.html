&gt;&gt; Remote mind control by radio-controlled brain implants 
&gt;&gt; had been mastered as far back as 1964, to the point that 
&gt;&gt; scientists "played" animals "like little electronic toys,"
&gt;&gt; according to the following New York Times article:

The same thing HAS been done with people... and I believe it was done before
it was done with animals. I remember reading about some guy in Louisiana or
something in the 50s who was a schizophrenic and homosexual, and they put a
wire into his pleasure center, and the hospital staff gave him control of
the button while he was watching a heterosexual porno, then got a prostitute
for him (really!). I don't have the source with me so I don't remember the
exact details, but it was from a book called "The Three Pound Universe".
They also use it to control pain in terminally ill people.. I think the
basal ganglia is the area that is stimulated. Someone who took</a> a
biopsychology class told me that one day the professor brought in a rat who
had a wire directly into his basal ganglia, and could stimulate it with a
lever, and the rat had been pressing the lever for three days straight, and
while the professor is going over this to the class, the rat dropped dead
from exaustion.. some girl in the class started complaining that it was
cruelty to animals and he said "honey, this rat died happier then you'll
ever be in your whole life". Apparently the procedure is not nearly as
addictive with humans, and they can control it pretty well when they get one
put in. I also seem to remember being told in a class that they have placed
electrodes into people amygdala's to control anger.
