You know, I'm wondering if something hasn't gotten lost in the retelling.

<p>
Specifically, I wonder if someone in the chain of hearsay substituted
"capitalist" for some other word that Frank used. I know he had little
respect for hypocrites and the self-important. And a lot of the people who
work and play in the tops of skyscrapers qualify.

<p>
Greg, _The Idiot Bastard Son_ is perfectly germane: "...the child will
thrive and grow, and enter the world of liars and cheaters and people like
_you_, who smile and think you know what this [the song--MMB] is about...
You think you know everything--maybe so--the song we sing--do you
know?--we're listening..."
