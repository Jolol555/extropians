Yes, but this is cancelled out by the finite probability that the action
will lead to eternal damnation and suffering.</a>  Thus utilitarians need not
consider themselves morally blameworthy if their breathing causes floods in
China; as far as anyone knew, NOT breathing would have had felt the same odds.

This is another answer.

<a name="2364qlink2"><a href="2294.html#2315qlink3">&gt;But here I see a problem for utilitarians... If other people's </a><br>

<p>
This is only a problem if the universe turns out to be open and that an
infinite number of intelligent beings are already out there.  If this</a> is
not the case, then there's no problem to address.

<p>
<a name="2364qlink3">Even if this were the case, however, the infinities could still be
compared.  Remember, however, that comparing total utility is hard even
when you've only got a finite number of people.  But let's suppose that you
had an infallible method for doing that.  At that point, you could start
making claims about one infinite set being a proper subset of the other
infinite set, etc.  And remembering that each action in such a universe
would have literally an infinite consequence, it could even make sense to
say that one action compared to another may even result in infinities with
different cardinalities, in which the answer is clear: choose the bigger
infinity of the two.</a>
