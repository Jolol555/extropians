I'm sorry, are you implying that profits are bad?

<p>
The only type of true corporate welfare are grants given to businesses
by the government.  All tax decreases are in effect price decreases
for consumers.  You seem to imply that there is some fair share of the
"tax burden" that corporations should take.  That's silly.  All income
taxes that the government imposes on corporations are passed to
consumers as price increases.  Corporations pay no income tax.
