<a name="0399qlink1">High speculation brainstorming seed follows:

<p>
I call this Peering Into the Past Technology or PIP Tech.  If the
resolution were good enough, it would mean resurrection for all who
had descendants interested in such.  Might peering at Earth from the
other side of a black hole be a possible PIP Tech - anyone?  Even if
so, I don't see how you could possibly get the resolution needed. 
What other PIP Tech's are possible?</a>  

<p>
Resurrection would occur via the PIP Tech future users scanning the
brain of the subject at a time just before his/her death and then
implementing it into an upload.  You might want your exact coordinates
and time of death well documented if PIP Tech is remotely possible. 
You might want to go as far as documenting the last time before your
death that there was no obstruction between you and the sky ( e.g.
just before you entered the hospital).  You don't want your
descendants to have to go through too much trouble - they might just
give up, or end up implementing you five years before your death. 

<p>
This is sort-of unextropian in the sense of dynamic optimism.  That
is, just sit back and wait... Don't worry,... Be happy.  I say, don't
count on it.  Even if you do, at best, you'll miss out on everything
that happens between your death and the invention of PIP Tech (e.g.
the singularity).
