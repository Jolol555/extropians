<p>
your concept of identity is only valuable for a time in witch occur no
interactions between the respective brains and their environments. Very
Very short time, probably equal to zero in the universe. With what kind
of magic are you able to switch the two brains without interacting with
them?

<p>
No, if we discuss of human brain, all the brain can also be viewed as a
big sense organ.It receive for example gamma rays from his environment.
the gamma rays received in some points of the brain are function of his
position in the space-time. the gamma rays are inducing reactions that
obviously can change the configuration of a brain.

<p>
<a href="1492.html#1494qlink3">&gt; A brain by itself has no way to determine it's position in space, or</a><br>

<i>&gt; brain.</i><br>

<p>
This is true if you are able to isolate *completly* a brain from the
universe of reference and simulate the complete fabric of this universe
inside this universe. Are you able to propose facts that it is possible
to construct such simulator?(universe of reference = where is
implemented the simulator)

<p>
you are asking for a complete identity of brains at a quantum level and
perhaps beyond. I seriously doubt there is a substantial probability
that such things can occur or are implementable.

<p>
I think a concept of identity form a brain as to take in consideration
his environment.
<br>
In such view, a brain is then defined by the total configuration of the
universe (the configuration of the brain and the configuration of his
environment).
