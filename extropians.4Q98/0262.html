A very interesting report in the latest Science News 
(10/17/98, 154:16) on artifical night illumination,
its effects on melitonin and thereby on cancer. 
Unfortunately it's not an article selected for 
their website (<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org">http://www.sciencenews.org</a>).

<p>
The Sceince News article states:

<p>
 "Exposure to light at night can disrupt the body's 
 production of melatonin, a brain hormone best known 
 for its daily role in resetting the body's biological 
 clock... Some researcher's have speculated that chronically
  decreasing nocturnal melatonin production -- 
 as with light -- might increase an individual's risk 
 of developing estrogen-related malignancies, such 
 as breast cancer.

<p>
 Two studies in Nordic populations now offer tentative 
 support for this idea.

<p>
 According to neuroendocrinologist Russel J. Reiter 
 of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center 
 at San Antonio, the emerging science indicates that, 
 functionally, "light is a drug" -- and that "by 
 abusing it, we risk imperiling our health.""

<p>
Gee, I guess this means the FDA will have to regulate light. 
The National Health Care System can no longer afford the high 
costs of the cancer rate, the FDA therefore decrees that all 
lights be turned off at 10pm. The SN article also states:

<p>
 "...researcher's have shown that melatonin also 
 functions as an antioxidant (SN:8/14/93, p. 109) 
 and an anticarcinogen."
