birth order is quite fun. it is both completely without value, and highly 
important. How is that?

<p>
Well, in a mixed sample, my ability to predict your IQ, personality or 
any other reliable individual difference based on birth order is 
quazi-zero.

<p>
However, if we compare population effects (say the difference between 
1920s and 1990s)  the proportion of first borns etc explains the bulk of 
the variance. The theory is a bit complex.  I am first born, then the 
mean IQ of my environment is quite high of the first few years (mom, dad, 
and me). Then along comes my brother. His mean situational IQ  is lower 
<br>
(it includes me ;-). Mine has also decreased, however I now have a <br>
language acquisition device trying to acquire knowledge from me (my young 
sib). This is great for me to learn: he pesters, I find out. I have to 
really find out otherwise he pesters me even more. So, being first born 
is a plus. The theory goes on to deal with cross over effects 
<br>
(advantageous for years 1-4, then relatively disadvantageous: for <br>
instance my young brother might get a leg up when he is starting school 
by bouncing his new experiences off me).

<p>
Anyhow, the real fun starts when you map these demographics out to school 
and society: you can get virtuous circles in which classes of young 
learners boot-strap each other - gen-X goes on the Internet for instance. 
While these situations can also lead to dark ages and depressions, they 
are precedents (from our view) for the singularity. 

<p>
So, the theory is not about birth order at all. It is about situational 
learning and birth order affects our situation by altering the 
surrounding information sources and sinks.

<p>
On a more speculative note (did he say MORE speculative ;-) my feeling is 
that the next 20 years give us a chance to hit the singularity, but that 
if we miss, life will not be fun. The world will be enter a vicious 
circle of old age, lack of output, lack of investment and general parlous 
disaster 1998 Japan * about 25 ;-(
