You mean, even nicer than when rendered with proportional fonts? Gosh!
It probably plays Gary D. while I read my mail, too. Unfortunately, I
have to deal with a lot of ASCII art. Too bad.

Maybe that's perhaps there's very little progress to be had from
converting to HTML? I can always convert my inbox with smart tools
like <a href="http://crit.org/critmail">http://crit.org/critmail</a>

<p>
<a href="2986.html#3039qlink3"> &gt; with text mail readers.</a><br>
 
<p>
Oh, my XEmacs can browse HTML ok. Question is, why should I bother?
Security reasons even not taken into account.

<a href="2986.html#3039qlink4"> &gt; Also, Netscape pre-4.07 saw both plain text, then an attachment at the</a><br>

<p>
Funny, I use Netscape only for browsing, with JavaScript and Java
turned off. Last time I activated it Netscape ate 250 MBytes worth of
swap for no good reason at all.
