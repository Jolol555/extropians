<p>
First, I would like to point out that the singleton hypothesis is in
itself rather debatable; I can't see why it is more likely than a
"multitude hypothesis" where we are bound to get an exponentially
increasing number of diverging entities. 

<p>
<a name="1392qlink2">As for insanity, I would say it is relative to a context. Behavior
</a>
that is rational in one environment is utterly irrational in another,
so insanity could be described as acting in a way unsuitable for one's
world - Alice is sane at home, but in Wonderland she is
insane. However, there is an additional factor of flexibility. Most
<a name="1391qlink1">people with mental problems today have less mental flexibility than
normal people - their repertoire of thinking and acting has been
limited due to their illness, and they often get stuck in nasty
attractor states (like in depression or paranoia).</a></a> 

<p>
<a name="1392qlink3">Would the singleton superintelligence be insane? Most likely it would
be quite good at behaving in a manner suitable for its world (i.e
using resources on a stellar scale);</a> in that respect I wouldn't call
<a name="1392qlink4">it insane. Would it have mental flexibility, so that it could get out
of bad attractors? Hard to tell, but it seems likely if it is composed
of a diverse set of subintelligences that are not too tightly
bound. Would it enjoy its existence? Depends on its value system and
analogue to enjoyment, extremely hard to say anything about.</a>
