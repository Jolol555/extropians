<a name="0957qlink1">There's a noticeable difference between a history professor who believes in
freedom and a lawyer who believes in pork and reelection, even if neither one

incremental progress.</a>  If Congress were composed of Gingriches, there'd be a

<i>&gt; decent.</i><br>

Really?  I would rather be governed by the first 535 names in a national
telephone directory than Congress, and I would rather be governed by the first
535 members of Worldcon than any other government in history.  Let's face it,
reading science fiction makes you smarter, faster, less susceptible to panic
in the face of future shock, less gullible, more idealistic, more rational,
more informed, and better capable of understanding technology and
technological change.  This tendency is stronger in Extropians and even
stronger in Singularitarians.

<p>
Think of it as a Future Shock hierarchy, measuring the ideas you can
contemplate without flinching.  At Shock Level One, the baseline, we have
technophiles, "The Road Ahead", "To Renew America", "Future Shock", virtual
reality, and Wired magazine.  At Shock Level Two we have medical immortality,
interplanetary exploration, and new ("alien") cultures - the average SF fan. 
At Shock Level Three we have nanotechnology, human-equivalent AI, minor
intelligence enhancement, uploading, total body revision - the average
Extropian.  At Shock Level Four you have the Singularity, complete mental
revision, far superhumanity, Powers, and evaporation of the causal network
called "Life as we know it" - the Singularitarians.  If there's a Shock Level
Five, I'm not sure I want to know about it.

<p>
Anyway, the point is that you can't introduce anyone to an idea more than one
Shock Level above - and Shock Levels measure what you accept calmly, not what
you know about; there are very few SL4ers, and I was *not* one of them (too
enthusiastic) when I wrote "Staring Into the Singularity".  If somebody is
still worried about virtual reality (low end of SL1), you can try explaining
medical immortality (low-end SL2), but not nanotechnology (SL3) or uploading
(high SL3).  They might believe you, but they will be frightened - shocked.

<p>
Gingrich wrote at SL1, but probably toned it down a bit - he was writing for
an SL0 audience and knew it.  He was very likely SL2, and could have reacted
to SL3 ideas without screaming and running away.  Now we're stuck with an SL0
Congress that keeps trying to censor the Internet.  Maybe, since Al Gore
chaired the Senate hearings on nanotechnology, he could be a force for sanity
- but frankly, I think he was just sucking up to the techies.
