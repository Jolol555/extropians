<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Let me quote how you qualified the use of the term "economic growth".
<hr>
<br>
Robin Hanson's JOT ABSTRACT <a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/">http://www.transhumanist.com/</a>

<p>
    "Economic growth is determined by the supply and 
demand of investment capital; "

<p>
Max More EP 3.0 <a href="http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm">http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm</a>

<p>
"The market price system encourages conservation, substitution, 
</a>and innovation, preventing any need for a brake on 
growth and progress. "

<hr>

<p>
I say: Investment capital and the market price system mean 
only one thing; - money. Although the market system 
is analysed as a negative feedback loop, money has 
been shown to create self re-inforcing positive 
feedback loops of wealth/poverty vicious circles.

<p>
The global economy and capitalism as we have known 
it is already in transition. 
</a>

<p>
The industrial mode of development is being 
transformed by the emergence of a new techno-economic
paradigm - brought about by the pervasiveness of 
effects of the new technologies - heralding a new
informational mode of development. 

<p>
The main distinctive feature that constitutes the 
information technology paradigm is that information is its
raw material. In previous technological revolutions, 
information simply acted on technology, whereas now,
the new technologies act on information. New sources 
of energy underpinned successive industrial revolutions, 
just as information is the 'energy source' of the 
information technology revolution. Information 
processing enables knowledge to intervene upon 
knowledge itself in order to generate higher 
productivity, as with finance capital. 

<p>
The informational mode of development represents 
a discontinuity within capitalism - exemplified by the
paradigm shift - however, this is a coterminous process 
that for the moment cannot be disengaged from the
continuance of the industrial mode of development 
that it has transformed. 

<p>
The emergence of the information technology paradigm 
can be seen as a continuity within the dynamics of 
capitalism - as can the coterminous processes of 
financial capital and globalisation be seen as 
continuities of capital - but aspects of the new 
informational mode of development represent 
discontinuities with industrial capitalism, as 
organisational aspects show a qualitative shift 
has occurred in the structure of society itself. 

<p>
Quantitatively speaking though, the informational 
mode of development represents an exponential
escalation of every dimension. The certain 
continuity of this exponential escalation will 
inevitably determine the necessity for the 
informational mode of development to disengage 
from capitalism and the straight jacket
<br>
of finance capital's price and double-entry 
bookkeeping systems, heralding a new transactionbased
 economic system managed by a bevy of global 
artificial intelligence engines.
