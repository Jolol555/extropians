I suppose self-compatibility would be important if you wanted to make such a
'duplicate family', but I have trouble envisioning a scenario in which many
people would actually do so.  Copying personalities (presumably via an
upload/download process) requires that we have very advanced nanotechnology,
which in turn requires huge improvements in our ability to create complex
systems.  As a result, it should be possible to do much better than simply
duplicating yourself.</a>

<a name="3573qlink2">If uploading is possible at all, it should be feasible to re-engineer an
uploaded mind just like any other piece of software.  You could run multiple
instances of your sensory-processing and motor-control software in parallel,
allowing you to control more than one body at once.  For better fault
tolerance you could even turn yourself into a collective mind, with local
processing in each body so that they can function if your data links go
down.  Spread yourself across a few hundred humanoid bodies and a similar
number of useful robots and/or vehicles, and you become very hard to kill.
How's that for an interesting post-human mode of existence!</a>
