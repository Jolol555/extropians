I'll drink to that, and add to it Buddha's last words to his brother
Ananda,
<br>
"Be a light unto yourself." That sums it up for me.

<p>
To live as a _Buddhist_ carries with it all the ugliness committed by
followers.
<br>
To live as a _Buddha_ means to light the way for yourself as you light
the lamps of others.

<p>
In ordinary conversation, I've called myself a Buddhist about as often
as I've felt like a nut. To make people to think of me as a nut, I only
have to call myself a Buddha. If I want people to remember me, I'll have
to win Pascal's Wager -- the hard way. Thanks to Eliezer, Anders, and
Max for a stimulating exchange.
