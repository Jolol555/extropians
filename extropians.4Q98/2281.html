<P>Ideologues, theologues, and demagogues oppose reason and fear science

<P><BR>Well put. Although, one could argue that science itself contains
ideology, theology, and demagogy. We would like it otherwise, and in the
main I think that science is free from these things, but you see it (collective)
raise its ugly heads on occasion.

<P>PS: I consider myself a student/scientist specializing in "psychonomy"
-- a
<BR>word I made up to signify the study of cognition beyond the myth of
the
<BR>mind. Psychonomy relates to psychology as astronomy does to astrology.
<BR>Extropy plays an extremely vital part in this new field of science
(or
<BR>pseudo-science, if you feel intolerant), because extropy operates beyond
the
<BR>mind myth, and therefore merits careful and thorough study by extropic
<BR>psychonomers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="2300qlink1">Ah...this caught my attention: "Psychonomy relates to psychology as astronomy
</a>
does to astrology."&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; That's a really strong statement to
make. Perhaps you could elaborate?
<a name="2300qlink2"><P>Psychology as a field of science seems to contain specific sub-fields
</a>
that definately try to get at explaining cognition, general level consciousness,
self-awareness, etc. beyond the level of the "mind myth". That is, real
world physics are used in the sub-fields to explain what is going on in
the brain, rather than global level, "black box" oriented models.&nbsp;
Perhaps I am misunderstanding your term "mind myth" and you could elaborate
on this as well.
<P>Thanks,
