<a name="3649qlink1"><a name="3625qlink1">I am compiling my own personal reading list for the coming year.  I'd like to
know what some of the recent books you've read in the past year.</a>  I don't care
what the topic is, it does not even have to be dealing with transhumanist or
extropian topics.  I would appreciate any feedback I get.  I've learned to
appreciate the often eclectic tastes of the members of this list.
Additionally, I find it hard to search all the books out there for interesting
titles.  The collective efforts of the members on this list would serve as a
great boon for me! :)  Hopefully, other members will benefit from the feedback
I get from this also.

<p>
Happy New Year!
