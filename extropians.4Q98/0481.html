<p>
Dunno what Eliezer would say, but here's my two cents:

<p>
Yes, it is unlikely that the greater part of humanity will
ever upload.  However, the extraordinary conpetitiveness of
even fast human level intelligence (say, faster by a factor
of 10) will mean that if a small percentage of transhumans
intend to compete for the Earth's resources, some other 
transhumans and all humans will lose.  IOW, upload or else.

<p>
<a name="0485qlink1"><a href="0479.html#0481qlink2">&gt; Furthermore, the assumption that technology will have progressed *that* far</a><br>
<i>&gt; in the next fifty years is not an extrapolation that I would care to gamble</i><br>
<i>&gt; on.  Though I would honestly love for this claim to be true, my optimism</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0485qlink2">The only technology required for that assumption is nanotech,
and that seems to only be 5-20 years away.  Curiously, the 
<a name="0502qlink1">people most knowledgeable about nanotech predict the shortest
times until we have it (e.g. Zyvex' website claims that they
will have an assembler within 5-10 years).</a>  If so, and if 
the resulting machine is replicating, then posthumans could
exist within weeks of that point.</a>
