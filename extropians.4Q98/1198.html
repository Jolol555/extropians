patrick, regarding tv violence, my neices have never been desensitized
to violence, having never seen it, in any form.  when they were visiting
i brought out a video tape of disney's jungle book.  didnt work, for they
were terrified, utterly wasted them.  that scene where the four vultures
are hassling some creature, they couldnt handle that.  im sure this bodes
ill for these kids.  spike
