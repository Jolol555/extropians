This seems strange to me, coming from a guy who reacted to the record
industry's reluctance to distribute his work by creating his own successful
record company and then, in the last ten years of his life, sponsored a series

<a name="3583qlink3">of travelling lecture shows by western business executives to teach
entrepreneurial skills in post-Soviet Russia.  Of course, this was the same
man who wrote "The Idiot Bastard Son" and advised us not to eat the yellow
snow . . .
