Oh please. You've bought into the dummycrat propaganda. They make you think
that if the government lets you get away with paying less than they think you
should that your stealing the government's money, ie you are getting a
subsidy. The idea of 'corporate welfare' is a crock made up by liberals trying
to sheild the last of the real welfare state by trying to weave a concept of
'moral equivalence'.

<p>
The corporate tax level is still up in the 30-40% range. Fortunately, it is
only a tax on profits. It would be nice if families could only pay taxes on
their family profits, eh? In that respect I agree that families are getting
the shaft. What is worse about corporate taxes is that with the exception of
Subchapter 'S' corporations, corporate earnings are taxed TWICE at the 30-40%
range each time, first as a corporate profits tax, then as capital gains tax
on the individual shareholder's dividend earnings and any increase in value
when the stockholder sells the stock. Now, since the average profit level for
corporations is around 5% of gross revinues, then the average taxes paid, as a
percentage of gross revinues is around 2.5%. Additionally, this is all
dependent on profits. However, it does not include other taxes, like sales
taxes, FICA taxes on employers, property taxes, and value added taxes.
Additionally, if one company owns another company, the the shareholders only
get earnings on the owned companies after it has been taxed twice, then they
get taxed too.

<p>
And in the end, all corporate taxes get passed on to you and me, no matter
whether we are customers or investors. The concept that corporations are
getting welfare means that we are all getting welfare indirectly.... how does
that grab you?
