<a href="1465.html#1467qlink1">&gt;How do you come at this? I wasn't aware there was any good evidence</a><br>
<i>&gt;differences in lateralization between men and women that contributed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;cognitive style. While the brain clearly processes different sorts of</i><br>
<i>&gt;information in different hemispheres I don't think there is any evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;that would allow you to  attribute broad cognitive styles to a dominance in</i><br>
<i>&gt;one or other hemisphere. I would be interested if you have any references</i><br>
<i>&gt;that support this view.</i><br>

<a name="1481qlink1">I've read that left-handed people are less lateralised than right-handed
people (i.e. the left and right hemispheres are less specialised in
particular faculties so there is an intermingling of functions throughout
the brain).</a> Being left-handed myself I've often wondered about how true this
is and what implications it has for intellectual ability, specialities, etc.
<a name="1481qlink2">Since men are more likely to be left-handed than women, doesn't that imply
that women are less lateralised than men?</a>
Is this in any way related to the other thing I've read of, that the IQ
distribution of left-handed people is more skewed towards the extremes?
(i.e. there are proportionately more low IQ and high IQ left-handed people).
Because men are supposed to have a more skewed IQ distribution than women
too.
