From: Paul Hughes &lt;planetp@aci.net&gt;

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1730.html#1767qlink1">&gt;&gt; The victim is dead, but not forgotten. It is in his/her best</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interest, and ours, that justice is served.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1730.html#1767qlink2">&gt;Your still implying such a magical technology because you just</a><br>
<i>&gt;re-stated that killing the murderer is in the victims</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-interest.  I repeat, how can a dead person have</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-interest? You have failed to demonstrate this.</i><br>

<p>
I was speaking rhetorically, however every human society recognizes
that it's members have inherent self-interest in not being murdered
and prohibit it. Since in the case of a murder victim, the victim
cannot act in that interest, the society does.

<p>
<a href="1730.html#1767qlink3">&gt;&gt; As I pointed out above, the debt cannot be repaid since the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;value of the murderers life is less than that of the victim. Yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;justice demands he/she pay all they can.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1730.html#1767qlink4">&gt;'Justice'?!?  I could just as easily say that justice demands that</a><br>
<i>&gt;you should die for speaking on a street corner.  Certainly China</i><br>
<i>&gt;views such penalties as justice for those who buck the Party's</i><br>
<i>&gt;dogma. You accept as dogma that justice equals an 'eye for an</i><br>
<i>&gt;eye'. I do not share your definition of 'Justice'.  Since when is</i><br>
<i>&gt;justice written down in stone? Why should I accept your definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;over another?  Imposing your sense of justice over others is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;a very 'just' thing to do.</i><br>

<p>
I am not China, nor do I advocate the death penalty for anything
other than murder. The last time justice was written down in stone
I believe was the code of Hammurabi.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1730.html#1767qlink5">&gt;&gt; You choose to forget the victim, I chose rationally to forget</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the murderer.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1730.html#1767qlink6">&gt;How have I forgotten the victim?  The victim is dead, but not</a><br>
<i>&gt;forgotten.  You refuse to acknowledge that the victim is dead. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The majority of your argument is resting on the imaginary concept</i><br>
<i>&gt;that somehow we are helping the victim by killing their murderer. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you suggesting that we are helping them in the afterlife?  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;so, what proof do you have that they live in this afterlife?</i><br>

<p>
As I've already stated, since the victim was killed, it is the
society that must act for them.

<p>
<a name="1776qlink1">Since you are so opposed to the death penalty, I suggest you add a
clause to your living will stating in the event of your horrible
murder, you do not wish the killer to receive the death penalty.

<p>
If a member of the jury, I would honor your request.</a>
