Close, but no cigar (as Dr Freud might say).  For behold,

It's not that Mary was *conceived* miraculously.  As you note, she had two
human parents, unlike Jesus.  It's that she was conceived *free of the
Stain of Original Sin* - and you know you just *can't* wash that out
without Blood of the Lamb, which did not yet exist - passed down to the
rest of us from Adam (or perhaps Eve; maybe it's mitochondrial).  That is,
from the moment of conception Mary affirmed a baptism of faith, due to the
special metaphysical aperture granted to her by her future, um, Polygamous
Husband.
