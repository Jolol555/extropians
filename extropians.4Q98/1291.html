BilLee Miller says:

<p>
<a href="1282.html#1291qlink1">&gt;	I've explained it before.  I'll explain it again.  There is</a><br>
<i>&gt;absolutely no biological basis for the conceptual distinction of race.</i><br>

<p>
That is not an explanation: it is a claim.

<p>
<a href="1282.html#1291qlink2">&gt;We're just as likely to be more genetically similar to a person of a</a><br>
<i>&gt;different "race" as we are to a member of the same "race."  </i><br>

<p>
That is irrelevant to the claim that races are as  meaningful a grouping 
of humans as they are of other species.

<p>
I could use the same logic to say that there is no such thing as birth 
order by noting that I am as likely to have a personality more similar to 
someone of another birth order as I am to someone who shares my birth 
order. The critical question is not do the distirbutions overlap at all, 
but does aggregating across (putative) members leave reliable differences 
and secondarily, can these differences be attributed to gene frequencies 
within the mating population? If there are no differences, they will 
disappear in the aggregation. If there are, they will shine forth. The 
<a name="1390qlink1">fact is that are reliable aggregate differences which have meaningful 
social outcomes.</a>

<p>
<a href="1282.html#1291qlink3">&gt;Literally a</a><br>
<i>&gt;racist is a person who believes in the existence.</i><br>

<p>
Oh i see: you need no proof that what someone might say is wrong: that 
they say it is proof that it is wrong: how handy for you. 

<p>
This is structurally identical to Dworkin's claim that women have no need 
to prove that pornography is harmful or even to define pornography. 
Pornography is whatever a powerless person says it is, no one can 
meaningfully dispute this, and the mere claim that it is pornographic is 
proof that it is harmful.

<p>
This is mind-rotting nonsense.
 
<p>
<a href="1282.html#1291qlink4">&gt; I think Richard Dawkins</a><br>
<i>&gt;provided a strong argument group selection in _The Selfish Gene_ for most</i><br>
<i>&gt;of us to reason that any major distinctions into massive human groups</i><br>
<i>&gt;are probably memetic rather genetic.</i><br>

<p>
Umm. I guess it is just an editing slip up, but Dawkins is virulently 
opposed to group selection. Anyhow, could you supply a citation from "the 
selfish gene" to the effect that it has been empirically demonstrated 
that there are not now, and never have been, any human groups 
distinguished by statistically significant differences in gene frequency? 

<p>
To my mind, race is like the use of the term type in the Myers Briggs 
personality scale: it would only be appropriate if significant 
bi-modality or higher order multi modal peaks were found in the gene 
frequencies when mapped out against dimensions known to underlie 
speciation: dimensions such as geographical location. In the case of 
personality, type claims are not supported by the evidence. It si a 
similar matter of empirical investigation whether this is the case for 
race.


<OL>
  <li>  All members of a species have the same gene loci.
  <li>  Individuals have one and only one allele at each locus on each strand 
of DNA. 
  <li>  If those gene frequencies were randomly distributed geographically and 
on all other dimensions affecting mate choice, then there could be no 
justification for the term race.


</OL>
<p>
If, however,  we find that certain alleles differ significantly in 
frequency between groups distrubuted on these dimensions which underlie 
speication, then the term race has utility (meaning):it describes this 
inhomogeneity in gene frequency.

<p>
It is a scientific question: either gene frequencies are distributed 
non-normally, or they are not. Either groups of hominids were 
reproductively (relatively) isolated for considerable periods of time or 
they were not. If they were, racial differences will evolve. They must 
because it is exactly these differences which drive speciation and we 
have species. Or don't you believe in species either?

Dr. Hans Moravec, principal research scientist at the Robotics Institute 
at Carnegie Mellon,  recently wrote a business prospectus outlining the 
development of "autonomous free-ranging utility robots for the mass 
market before 2005.

<p>
"Until recently, Dr. Moravec said, autonomous robots -- those capable of 
operating without direct human control -- had the functional intelligence 
of insects. "Today the actual level of intelligence of computers is just 
starting to touch the lower vertebrate levels," he said. "As soon as 
2010, we could have general-purpose robots comparable in intelligence to 
lizards. Then there could be mouselike intelligence, with learning and 
adaptation, by 2020, and monkeylike intelligence by 2030." At that stage, 
Dr. Moravec said, "you could be talking to the household robot and you 
would think that it is conscious." "By 2040, the fourth-generation 
household robot could add a layer of reasoning and become humanlike, Dr. 
Moravec said. 

<p>
"After that, we humans are obsolete," he said with a chuckle.
