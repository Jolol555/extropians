<i>&gt; &gt; I have to agree that Wilson's hierarchy is total gibberish, cognitively</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; another usually is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This a perfect case of the "pot calling the kettle black", as I</i><br>
<i>&gt; quote from your 'Coding a Transhuman AI':</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "The modules sum together to form abilities; the abilities sum</i><br>
<i>&gt; together to form intelligence."</i><br>

<p>
And please quote the disclaimer!

<p>
" *This principle is not useful for hierarchical design* [italics in
original]; it is just a way of viewing the AI.  You can't design abilities
independently of each other; some modules, perhaps even the majority, will be
useful for everything - mathematical ability and causal analysis ability and
combinatorial design ability.  Some modules will be so basic as to constitute
a part of the architecture itself."

<p>
<a href="2373.html#2422qlink2">&gt; If that is not another way of saying -- "lower" modules sum</a><br>
<i>&gt; together to create "higher" abilities, those "higher" abilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; sum together to create an even "higher" intelligence -- I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what is.  It is saying *EXACTLY* the same thing.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2448qlink1">My bogosity detectors go off whenever I read "X levels of consciousness"
arranged into ascending order, because I know perfectly well that the "good
guys" will be operating at level eight and the "bad guys" will be operating at
level one.  Wilson is making a moral distinction; I'm making a design distinction.</a>

<p>
<a name="2448qlink2">Furthermore, as has been pointed out, anything designed in for "future
evolution" is a flaming lie.  If you could find one single example of that it
would overturn the entire field of evolutionary biology.</a>

<p>
<a name="2448qlink3"><a href="2373.html#2422qlink3">&gt; I'm aghast that you and Damien (both whom I respect highly by the</a><br>
<i>&gt; way) can't see past the 1977 hippie prose</i><br>

<p>
Any author who wants to make me wade through 1977 hippie prose to find out
what he's saying can take a hike.  (Similar considerations apply to artists,
social scientists, psychoanalysts, and professors of literature.)</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; to see the obvious fact</i><br>
<a href="2373.html#2422qlink4">&gt; that manipulating genes (circuit 7) which created the neural</a><br>
<i>&gt; structures to begin with, is more flexible than simply playing</i><br>
<i>&gt; with those neurons themselves (circuit 6).  Or that manipulating</i><br>
<i>&gt; genes is inherently less flexible compared to</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology's (circuit 8) ability to manipulate the atoms that</i><br>
<i>&gt; compose those genes.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2448qlink4">So, if I dig through the hippie prose, I'll find a claim that the multilevel
laws of biology and physics are somehow mirrored in the brain?</a>  I don't think so.

<p>
<a href="2373.html#2422qlink5">&gt; &gt;  Where does genius come from?  From computation. What kind of</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; computation?  See</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Coding a Transhuman AI".</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; One of Tim</i><br>
<a href="2373.html#2422qlink6">&gt; Leary's greatest wishes before he died was to see his 8-circuit</a><br>
<i>&gt; model re-written</i><br>
<i>&gt; by someone like you, with a more articulate and precise command</i><br>
<i>&gt; of scientific and technological language.  As I suggested</i><br>
<i>&gt; earlier, this thread is a perfect example of why such a revision</i><br>
<i>&gt; is increasingly necessary for a more cyber-savvy generation.</i><br>

<p>
Go right ahead.  Don't let me stop<a name="2448qlink5"> you.  Let me know when I can read about
distinctions between neurons, genes, and atoms instead of extraterrestrial ear
lobes or whatever Wilson/Leary was gibbering about.</a>
