Seems everybody everywhere has this problem.

<p>
Ever wonder why most people just don't seem to be able to relate to =
transhumanist ideas. Could it be a lack of interest or lack of =
intellect? Is there any way that we can do to change this sad state of =
affairs? I'm pretty sure the world would be much better off for it.
