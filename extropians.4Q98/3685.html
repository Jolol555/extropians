<p>
I have now passed the 100 marker of new people who have contacted me and
asked me to add their name to the Extropic Art Manifesto.  

<p>
People with whom I have communicated with have read both the Transhumanist
Art Statement 2.0 and the Extropic Art Manifesto and support both
statements.  

<p>
"We are transhumans ... " and excerpts from the Manifesto are continuing on<br>
their way to Saturn on board the Cassini spacecraft.  This is the first
time these words are traveling across our Solar System.

Where is Cassini Now?

<p>
These images show SIMULATED views of and from the Cassini spacecraft. The
upper left view shows Cassini on its trajectory to Saturn, as well as its
speed with respect to the Sun and the distance it has travelled since
launch. The upper right view shows the view to Earth from Cassini. The
lower left view shows the view to the next body Cassini will encounter, and
the lower right view shows the view to Saturn, Cassini's final destination.

Cassini Significant Events for 12/24/98 - 12/29/98 

<p>
Spacecraft Status:

<p>
The most recent spacecraft status is from the DSN tracking pass on Tuesday,
12/29, over the Goldstone tracking station. The Cassini spacecraft is in an
excellent state of health and is executing the Cruise 11 sequence normally.
The speed of the spacecraft can be viewed on the "Where is Cassini Now?"
web page (<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/today/">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/today/</a>). 


<p>
Spacecraft Activity Summary:

<p>
On Thursday, 12/24, the Probe Support Avionics (PSA) prime status was
reset. This activity follows each Probe Checkout (PCO). 

<p>
On Sunday, 12/27, Instrument Checkout (ICO) began. The first ICO activities
involved the successful maneuver of the Spacecraft to a High Gain Antenna
(HGA) to Earth point attitude. Once two-way communications was established
using the HGA, the Probe data from PCO #3 that was stored on the SSR was
played back, and a realtime command to clear the AACS High Watermarks was
uplinked to the spacecraft. 

<p>
On Monday, 12/28, the Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) began ICO activities
with Ultra Stable Oscillator Test #1. The test was extremely successful and
was the first time ever for three frequencies (S-Band, X-Band, and Ka-Band)
to be simultaneously downlinked from a single spacecraft and recorded on
the ground. 

<p>
On Tuesday, 12/29, RSS performed its second test, a repeat of USO test #1
but without Ka-band transmission. 

<p>
Upcoming events:

<p>
The events planned for the next reporting period consist primarily of a
continuation of the ICO activities. RPWS, MAG, CDA, MIMI, CAPS, INMS, UVIS,
and continued RSS tests are the principal participants.
