greg i checked it out.  chilling indeed.  perhaps we should contact this
group and invite them to exterminate all genetically altered crops
in the states.</a>  they might wish to invite a couple million of their
compatriots, start on the east coast and pull up pretty much every
commercially viable crop they see, for nearly all have been bred or
genetically altered in some way from their wild ancestors.  better
slaughter all the farm animals too, just to be safe.  its their revenge
for the boston tea party.  point out how grateful we all will be in their
ideal vision: a food-free world.

<p>
i checked out your website.  wow!  its a work of art.  extremely
well done.  may i link my upcoming site to it?  spike
