authenticated kernel patches via network and automagically 
recompiling the kernel periodically. Paradoxically, one of 
the more secure systems is MacOS, a closed-shop system. By 
using well-cured TCP/IP implementations you can reduce the 
probability of a  buffer overrun scan finding a hole within 
minutes, but you can't prevent it from happening altogther. 
And this doesn't at all address the application layer -- 
while applications are multiplying like flies. The only way
to leave this behind is to step away from brittleware. Sorry,
don't see this happening within one decade from now.

A measureable, but minor effect.

<p>
<a name="1427qlink3"><a name="1426qlink3">Ok. Macs (Be? OS/2?) are rarely used by hackers, hence the exploits
are rare. Same applies to switch/router firmware. That's obscurity. 
If you have a 100 types of systems, each with a 1% market share, no worm is
ever an issue. Civilization doesn't collapse if 1% of all systems are
suddenly taken out of circulation. (I know this for certain, since the

percentile of crashed M$ boxen at this instant is probably
significantly higher than 1% ;)

<i> &gt; easy to think of reasons why it won't decrease and will likely</i><br>
<i> &gt; increase:</i><br>

<p>
Marginally. You've got mostly a redistribution of market shares.

<p>
<a href="1358.html#1398qlink5"> &gt; * I'd guess that unix, Microsoft, Macintosh, and various network</a><br>

<i> &gt;   None of these are going away.</i><br>

<p>
Microsoft contributes the bulk, with Mac ranging at less than 10% and
Unix (well, Linux actually) a more or less close third. Network
firmware will be Cisco and Bay Networks mostly, eh? 

<p>
<a href="1358.html#1398qlink6"> &gt; * Both dominant providers are facing perilous product transitions</a><br>

<i> &gt;   up the field for new systems.</i><br>

<p>
I think there is much conservation within software product
families, rendering derivates susceptible. Diversity of machine 
languages is a major bulwark against system perversion, however. 
Even if the hole is the same, the code will crash on a different 
architecture. Intel recently pushing StrongARM, rediscovering 
Linux and Compaq enamoured with Alpha does seem like a good thing, 
but some ten architectures none of them dominating the market share? 
Improbable.

Yeah, 'diversity' as in 'Java'. Show me a bugless VM implementation.

P.S. Heard Drexler for the first time in person, today. Excellent speaker.
