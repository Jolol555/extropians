<a name="1217qlink1">From: Patrick Wilken &lt;patrickw@cs.monash.edu.au&gt;


<p>
<a href="1207.html#1210qlink1">&gt;There was a recent article in Nature/Science suggesting that music training</a><br>
<i>&gt;in childhood permanently raised verbal IQ. I haven't read the article so</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't comment, but it seemed to have surface plausibity. The argument that</i><br>
<i>&gt;similar (same?) areas of the brain are used by both.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="1241qlink1"><a name="1239qlink1">As a long time musician (+15 Years) I am absolutely convinced that music is
no more than a stylised abstraction of the human language!</a></a>

<p>
Music consists of rythm, tone and pitch. When I hear my kids learning to
</a>
speak they don't say the words right at first, but the rythm, tone and pitch
is in place long before that.

<p>
My youngest girl is called Clara and when she tries to say her name it comes
out as ara or aha.
<br>
My oldest son is called Magnus and she pronounces that as arhus.
When she tries to say "thank you for dinner" (tak for mad) it comes out as
"ak or ad".
<br>
In fact everything she tries to say comes out as a "musical" version of the
right words and sentences. Even when it's all garbled the rythm is usually
right.

<p>
<a name="1239qlink2">It would also explain what a musical genre</a> is. A dialect of a musical
language. When the dialect becomes too different from it's root language it
becomes a new language.

<p>
<a name="1239qlink3">Any music we don't know ususally seems boring and superficial. That is
probably because we don't understand the "language"</a> and "dialect" of that
genre. Thus we cannot enjoy the details, which is what usually defines a
genre.
