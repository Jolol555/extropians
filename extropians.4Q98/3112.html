    The book (for the latecomers, "The Truth Machine" by James Halperin), to its
credit, doesn't try to explain HOW it is done, you just understand that it has
been done. It is a good read, no matter what you believe about the future; but it
develops a lot of the threads discussed here-- AI, nanomachines, alt. medicine,
cloning, cryogenics-- as secondary plot to the main. (Each chapter, 3 - 5 years
later than the previous, starts with related and unrelated current headlines to
keep the reader up to speed).

<p>
    While I don't think that it is technically impossible, one of the things that
bothered me is that the machine would "flicker" when it detected a partial truth
or a withholding of facts, which expands the complications of such a machine
infinitely.

<p>
    As far as the sociological aspects of such a machine, one aspect was an
initial wave of suicides. In this book the market embraced it, however, to
eventually having "wrist truth machines" for when a girl asks her man if she
looks good today.
