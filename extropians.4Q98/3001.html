No, and that's exactly my point.  Were I to bankrupt myself, it 
wouldn't even be a drop in their bucket of disaster-induced need.  
Present-day Honduras is a place and time where government 
assistance means the difference between life and death for masses 
of hard-working but now destitute people who did NOTHING to 
deserve their plight.  So you don't care; then go ahead and take 
ethical egotism to the solipsistic extreme.  It's an irrefutable position, 
but a lonely one.     Joe

Maybe plenty of BOTH!   Joe
