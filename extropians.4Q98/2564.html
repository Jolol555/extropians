<p>
There cannot be any such thing as 'moderately advanced' nanotech, at
least not for long. In fact, the second assembler after the (cruddish)
bootstrap assembler will be already highly sophisticated, because by
then the design space would have been pretty thoroughly explored by 
human artifexes equipped with design tools (the fun may indeed start 
pretty soon, if OpenChem indeed gets off ground in finite time). We 
also now have the outline specification for the optimal 'omega' 
computational hardware (funny thing, looks exactly like a reversible 
3d CA in molecular circuitry to me -- I also don't see the fuss about 
bit erasure, as a lot of very useful computations are perfectly 
reversible), which can be immediately piped into the design iteration 
loop, in its instance as reality simulator (fitness function) and 
GA (structure generation). You don't need much resources to start 
that runaway loop, a small team or a single competent person 
should suffice. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if NanoCAD packages 
would soon to be declared munitions, but I guess they will have leaked
out via the Open Source model before the bureucrats realize what is 
going on. (At least that's what I hope).

some of my preferences, I have not yet studied the issue wholly). 
It seems to me that we are rapidly approaching the point where the 
first prototype design will be exhaustively validated by computational
means. After that, all hell will break lose: funding, which is lavish 
even now, will grow astronomical.
