  IAN: Don't forget a water-filtration unit 
  in case saved-water runs out. But if things 
  really get bad enough that such items are 
  utilized, then we are talking about the 
  likelihood of roving bands of looters
<br>
  willing to kill you to get your 
<br>
  nice little supply of goods.

  I've been watching this issue and watching 
  the group of nay-sayers slowly but surely 
  dwindle, and the group of people on the 
  verge of panic increase. Even the more
  skeptical talk about gathering up 
<br>
  supplies before the date.

  Whatever the impact of Y2K on the U.S.,
  it stands to reason that much of the rest 
  of the world, already reeling under economic
  downturns, will get hit hard, since they are
  not in a situation now to hire all the hightech
   programers and the like to fix their
<br>
  entire computer systems. I hear that in 
  Russia, nothing is being done to prepair
   for Y2K. Countries in Africa,
<br>
  while there are very few computers
<br>
  per person, still have computer dependent
  infrastructures. These are the places where 
  the *bleep* may really hit the fan. This is
  may be the biggest problem in store for all.
