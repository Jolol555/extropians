<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   How could an anarcho-capitalist nation deal with an outside</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggression???</i><br>

<p>
By the best method, a guerrilla insurgency. Additionally, foreign covert ops would also be possible, if a group of PPAs see a
common outisde threat they may invest in a joint mercenary venture to neutralize the foreign threat to the ungoverned society.

<a href="2661.html#2737qlink2">&gt;    Can competing entreprises or individuals offer the same level of</a><br>
<i>&gt; service than a one block organisation, like the army?</i><br>

<p>
While people often decry the interservice rivalries in the US military, one cannot dispute that they are rated the best in the
world. They must be doing something right.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a href="2661.html#2737qlink3">&gt; &gt; And it is true there is a an element of competition in capitalism.  Every business has to match the prices and quality of</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their competitors, or they will go out of business.  But capitalism is a system of cooperation, not on force.  In order for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a business to survive, it has to cooperate with its suppliers, its employees, and its customers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    There is cooperation "inside" a capitalist organisation and with</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppliers, and competition with other organisation.... And on the long</i><br>
<i>&gt; term it seems like a good thing for the general economy, but what</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens in case of crisis? Who is in charge?</i><br>

<p>
Why does anyone need to be in charge? Most economic crises occur for two reasons: Widespread stock fraud, or severe governmental
inaccuracies in the reporting of economic data, especially as applied to reserve bank policies. In a high tech libertarian
society, neither could exist in large enough amounts to have such severe influence on the whole economy.

<p>
<a href="2661.html#2737qlink4">&gt;     When I speak about competition/cooperation, I speak about the</a><br>
<i>&gt; competition between entreprises and individuals that could lead you or</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to lose our jobs, and about cooperation considering the way people in</i><br>
<i>&gt; some systems are not stressed to work and can profit of others' work.</i><br>

<p>
If you don't work efficiently enough to make a profit at what you do, then you should find something else to do which you can
find profitable. Don't ask me to pay extra for you to do a bad job.
If I am the one doing work, I get to choose who I cooperate with, and who I allow to become my dependents. I can choose to donate
most of my earnings to charitable works, If that is what motivates me to succeed. Don't force me to donate to anything or anyone
I don't want to.
