Some people have suggested privatizing the roads. Let each company make
their own rules for the own roads, let them issue their own liscenses (or
respect the lisecses issued by some other organization), let them decide
their own limit for DUI and DWI, with only the power to bar people from
driving on their roads when they break it, and let them bear responsibility
for keeping their roads clear in winter. If an accident occurs due to their
negligence, they are open to a lawsuit, and if you don't like the way they
run their roads, the accident rate on their roads, or the price of driving
on their roads, you drive on a different one. In my opinion, some things are
just not feasible to privatize, and roads are one of them (is there enough
physical space for competition?), but this is how someone completely for it
would respond. Another possibility, without privatizing the roads, is to
hold any drunk driver who kills someone, or any driver at all who kills
someone for that matter, completely liable for their actions, no different
then a murder. I am not sure whether this would act as a deterent and
actually cut down on anything.

crimes?
