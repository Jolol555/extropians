<p>
I have a story called "I" in this month's _Odyssey_ (issue 6), a
British science fiction magazine.  (I was going to call it "We", but
that's already taken.)  I haven't seen it yet, but hear that it's out now.
I don't know what bookstores or newsstands might carry it.
Borders and Barnes &amp; Nobles do not.

<p>
It may be the first published story to present the positive side of
technological transhumanism.  (This shouldn't be so, but at the moment I
can't think of other examples.  The closest I can think of is Frederick
Pohl's "Day Million", but that still posits a society in which identity and
morality and sexuality are pretty much the same as today.)

<p>
The story is about what identity really means, and what the costs and
benefits of individuality are.  It's set a few hundred years in the future.
Life is no longer organic, and identities are no longer defined by bodies.
