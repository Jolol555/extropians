Robin, until other mechanisms for managing the flow of information 
are produced then all measurements of capital become hostage to the 
current accounting concepts of capitalism, i.e., orders, invoices, 
statements, profit &amp; loss, balance sheets, etc. There is no escaping 
this and no amount of hiding behind behind text books will convince 
me that your terms are anything but obfuscation. The only way to
break this hold over terminology is to explicitly deny the case for 
double entry bookkeeping and start a new information paradigm with 
a new set of terms.

<p>
I understand your goodwill in trying to divorce investment capital 
from money but you don't stress any alternative to a zero based money
system. For example under my concept of a public AI the data spaces 
that would be allocated to create meaning would not be arbitrarily
managed so as to restrict the supply of meaningful fractal
relationships.
<br>
There also would not be a form of trading data spaces so that certain 
meanings would get more space at the expense of others. This trading 
is implicit in your definition of investment capital.
