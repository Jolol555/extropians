<p>
Biological evolution doesn't seem to happen anymore, and even in the
relatively stable societies of the past it probably happened more
in the times of peace (selection of partners based on physical and
mental features) than at war, where the factors were largely random
on individual level.

<p>
As for the social and technological evolution, it appears to be determined
more by economic and social competition now than territorial/physical
conflicts.  And peace seems to be an important prerequisite for economic
competition in diverse areas, long-term investment, and innovation.
People can still intensely compete on the software market, the Olympics,
on scientific conferences and bestseller lists, without cutting each
other's throats.
