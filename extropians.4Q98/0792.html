<a href="0783.html#0792qlink1">&gt; and general overhead.  Even if the energy was free, my bill would</a><br>
<i>&gt; still be around $360 and that's not exactly a major increase in</i><br>
<i>&gt; quality of living.  A real benefit would be an energy box in everyones</i><br>
<i>&gt; home that requires occasional refills of cheap chemicals.  Now that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would make a difference.</i><br>

<p>
How many kilojoules of EMF can be transmitted from antenna arrays to 
one of those trinity flywheels (see <a href="http://www.trinityflywheel.com/">http://www.trinityflywheel.com/</a>)?

<p>
I mean, keep the suckers spinning nice and fast, in your back yard.  
Power it with radio waves (rather high amplitude, at that).

<p>
As long as it computers doing the wireless power transmission don't 
have bugs (see <a href="http://www.starshiptroopers.com/">http://www.starshiptroopers.com/</a>) you should be able 
to avoid getting accidentally vaporized (or is it liquified).  

<p>
I'm all for Open Source directed energy weapons, particularly for the 
crack dealers in WATTS.  That'll help them keep competition to a 
minimum.
