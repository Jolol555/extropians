<p>
No, exercise actually raises basal metabolism.

<p>
Unclear.  Metabolic rates seem to recover with extended calorie restriction in
rodents; the animals just weigh less.  The extreme life extension in C.
elegans
<br>
from nutritional restriction and now some genetic manipulation does seem to 
involve metabolic changes.

<p>
<a href="0822.html#0826qlink3">&gt; Is there any research about this?</a><br>

<p>
Yes.  Exercised rodents have roughly the same life expectancy regardless of
calorie intake.  They have a slight benefit from CR, but only about 10% life
extension from 50% restriction.  Non-exercised rodents get
tremendous benefits from CR.  The most severely restricted rodents outlive
any exercised rodents by a substantial margin - 10 to 20%.  Moderately
restricted rodents - 30% CR - live about as long as the "exercised norm".

<p>
Realistically, then, I don't think you should consider exercise as providing
the benefits of CR.  The "exercised norm" is probably a normal healthy
life.  The point of CR is to do better than that.

<p>
Nothing in the monkeys, as yet.
