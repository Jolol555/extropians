<p>
I see no reason to expect dictators to be stupid.  Some rulers do seem to
understand that free markets generate wealth (Singapore is a decent
example), and there could be others who simply don't act on the
understanding.  The problem, for them, is that allowing that first bit of
freedom endangers their own position too much to be worth the risk, by
making it much easier to stage a revolution.

<p>
If the economy is good, you can indulge your personal vices, and the secret
police only bother real criminals, who is going to bother to rebel?  In most
countries only a small minority of the population actually cares about
freedom - what most people want is security.  In America, or England, or a
few other countries with a democratic tradition, things might be different,
but most of the world doesn't care about democracy per se.  They just want
to be able to get by without someone shooting them.

<p>
I agree.  I don't see a good way to determine the answer without an
experiment, but I am disposed to expect the worst.  Anything that moves us
closer to a pure democracy is more likely to make things worse than better.
