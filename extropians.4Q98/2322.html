You can find lots of moral statements that 90% of all humans would agree to,
and a few statements that 95% would agree with, but that's about as wide a
consensus as you can get.  Besides, objective truth isn't determined by a
vote.  If you took a poll on cosmology 1,000 years ago, virtually everyone
would have agreed that the sun goes around the Earth.  That doesn't mean
that it does.

but *prove*, in an objective sense), that a moral proposition is false,
you're just trading opinions.</a>
