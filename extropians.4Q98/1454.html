<a href="1401.html#1454qlink1">&gt; &gt;  I can think of plenty of cases where gender does make a difference. But on many</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; "men are on average taller than women" to " men are taller" to  "couples in which the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; live in less likely, so it is a thought process I try to resist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
 Gender makes a big difference in sexual reproduction, by definition. I chose height as a
gender difference that has a commonly accepted measure. Cognitive style is much more
difficult to measure. The measurements proposed naturally include assumptions that may be
disputable - hence, I think, the political nature of such measurements.

<p>
 As soon as a system becomes at all complex, measurements imply assumptions and world views,
and hence politics. Even something as "technical" as measuring the performance of web servers
(my current area of expertise) can generate a lot of political heat. My theory is that it is
the unacknowledged changes in points of view that hobble the discussion. I am trying to
develope tools to translate one persons point of view into anothers, at least in this limited
domain.

<p>
 Hence my interest in this "differences" thread. Seems to me another case of a lot being lost
in translation. We are all using the same words but with a different implied context.
Mechanically translating the implied context would be a useful piece of intelligence
amplification, I think, and a suitably extropian project.
