<i>&gt; &gt;First, defense contractors under a libertarian society will more</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Held liable by who, by the way?</i><br>

<p>
No gunshop owners will not be held liable for the actions of a single
person with a single gun, or even a few guns.  To use the cliche, guns
don't kill people.  People kill people.  A single person buying small
arms does not present a direct threat to large numbers of people and
other business/money making organizations, regardless.

<p>
They will be held liable by their customers.  If someone sells weapons
of mass destruction to a party whose intentions are those other than
defensive, other customers will not buy from those companies, because
they would be contributing to a direct threat to their own existence
by continuing the business relationship.  In addition, defense
contractors in the US would be free to pursue other lines of business,
such as making vehicles for the consumer/commercial industries.
