Heres the result of the latest Harris Poll which asked people which professions
they respected the most:

<p>

<br>
Scientist 55%
<br>
Teacher 53%
<br>
Clergyman 46%
<br>
Policeman 41%
<br>
Engineer 34%
<br>
Military officer 34%
<br>
Architect 26%
<br>
Congress member 25%
<br>
Lawyer 23%
<br>
Athlete 20%
<br>
Entertainer 19%
<br>
Businessman 18%
<br>
Banker 18%
<br>
Accountant 17%
<br>
Union trader 16%
<br>
Journalist 15%

<p>

Congressmen...gotta be something wrong there...
