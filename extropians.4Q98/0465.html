That could be the explanation of the Fermi Paradox, the reason we can't
find any ET's. If it were possible to change your emotions to anything
you wanted, alter modes of thought, radically change your personality, swap
your goals as well as your philosophy of life at the drop of a hat it would
be very dangerous. Once you change yourself you may not want to change back,
<a name="0739qlink2">even if your behavior became bizarre or suicidal.</a>

<p>
Ever want to accomplish something but been unable to  because it's difficult,
<a name="0474qlink1">well just change your goal in life to something simple and do</a> that;
better yet, flood your mind with a feeling of pride and self satisfaction and
don't bother accomplishing anything at all. Think all this is a terrible idea
and stupid as well, no problem, just change your mind (and I do mean CHANGE
YOUR MIND) now you think it's a wonderful idea.

<p>
Complex mechanisms don't do well in  positive feedback loops, not electronics,
not animals, not people, not ET's and not even Jupiter brains.
