<i>&gt; &gt;etc.) brain stimulation?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: There is an external electrical mind control</i><br>
<i>&gt;   technology on the market. Unlike the flashing light </i><br>
<i>&gt;   and sound machines, it delivers an electric impulse</i><br>
<i>&gt;   via clips placed on the ear lobes, and by that means </i><br>
<i>&gt;   "entrains" the brain to follow the impulse frequency,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and the general aim is to induce deep relaxation.</i><br>

<a name="0426qlink1">Certainly a step in the right direction, but IMO still way
below the technology's true potential. Imagine a machine
that you just put on your head (I'm not sure<a name="0465qlink1"> how big the
total device would have to be, and how much energy it
would need etc., but even a static version would have great 
marketing potential) that gives you instant, safe pleasure
like you've never felt before. Resistance is futile -- you will
</a>
be pleasured, guaranteed. The ultimate form of entertainment;
you could look at a grey wall and still be amused (but to
make the experience more natural one could watch a
movie or listen to music for example). This kind of stuff
was so far only possible with dangerous (often illegal)
and unreliable chemicals. 

<p>
And this is just the pure hedonism part; other settings could
for example help you to achieve "deep thoughtful concentration" 
(great for work and study) or "super relaxation" (great against
all kinds of stress). How about using a relaxing</a> or pleasure
setting during operations, or to relieve any kind of chronic
or acute pain. There is a world of possible applications out there
right for the taking. If there ever was a product that's virtually
guaranteed to sell then this must be it.

<p>
<a name="0437qlink2">Now, can anyone tell me: why on earth isn't this product on
the market yet? Are there technical problems, or is everyone
just missing a great opportunity here? I mean, one could get
richer than Bill Gates by making a product that will virtually sell 
*itself*, and no doubt will change society quite a bit in the process.</a>
