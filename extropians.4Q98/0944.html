This is an interesting complication. However, I would consider it
a small price to pay to ensure that my mind didn't embark on some
completely undesirable path. The idea is similar to a conservative
investment policy. Do you invest in government bonds (old mind
review) or do you speculate on a unpredictable startup (say a prayer
and start tinkering with your heuristics)?

<p>
<a href="0926.html#0944qlink2">&gt; Consider that you will have close friends and associates, </a><br>

<i>&gt; disapproves while an old her doesn't, do you revert or not?</i><br>

<p>
This effect should be mitigated by the fact that both of your
old minds will be evaluating your new minds. Given that you were
friends prior to the day's changes, odds are you should only
approve of minds that are platonically compatible. However, the
whole arrangement adds new spice to the spectre of "growing apart". :)

<p>
&gt; What about your co-workers and clients and customers? How often <br>
<a href="0926.html#0944qlink3">&gt; will they tolerate your not recalling interations with them?</a><br>

<p>
Many ideas come to mind to mitigate these problems. You can have
"rogue identity insurance" in case your new mind entered into an
unsavory business deal. It should be possible to update the old
mind with selected memories from the new mind without changing
the old mind. A caveat though would be the memories would be
configured by the perceptions of the new mind's perspective.

<p>
Another problem Robin's comments bring to mind are crimes
committed by the new you that did not survive the review process.
Would the old mind be accountable for the new mind's actions? 
It seems there would have to be some level of accountability
on the part of the old mind for the new mind's actions or chaos
would ensue. Perhaps there would be lesser punishments imposed
on old minds for crimes committed by new minds. 

<p>
<a href="0926.html#0944qlink4">&gt; It seems to me that old version review has a place, but that </a><br>
<i>&gt; one can't afford to invoke it very often, and that the cost </i><br>
<i>&gt; of doing so increases with time, even though it probably takes</i><br>
<i>&gt; some time to see what changes you like.</i><br>

<p>
The cost would only increase to the extent that you view time
as a commodity. If you have no definite objective where conserving 
time becomes crucial, but instead have the simple goal of improving 
your mind (higher intelligence, etc.) then the time lost is not
as painful. The cost is further glossed when the review process
is viewed as a mind survival strategy. Any cost becomes
palatable when its objective is survival, exhibit A being present
day health care costs.
