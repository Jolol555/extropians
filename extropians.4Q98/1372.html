<a href="1346.html#1372qlink1">&gt; Thanks for the clarification. My background is psychology; my main area</a><br>
<i>&gt; being higher-level vision so I certainly am not an expert on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; neuroscience side of things (though of course everyone interested in these</i><br>
<i>&gt; issues is slowly drifting into the vortex of cognitive neuroscience).</i><br>

<p>
It is a fun vortex, multidisciplinary science in action. I just
wished there was more time to assimilate all the interesting
information being produced - I'm interested in so many levels that I
can't keep up.

<p>
<a href="1346.html#1372qlink2">&gt; &gt;I was thinking in this context of structural change in the sense of</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;deviation from normal neural structure (i.e dead neurons), and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;functional change in the sense of deviation of normal function. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;distinction is admitedly blurred, and might not even be perfect for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"wet" system like the brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I understand your definition, but isn't it likely to cause confusion? </i><br>

<p>
Yes :-)

<p>
<i>&gt; Cell</i><br>
<a href="1346.html#1372qlink3">&gt; death is only one extreme end in the spectrum of structural change that</a><br>
<i>&gt; occurs in the brain. All long-term memory formation (and for that matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; forgetting) causes structural change. Chronic drug use obviously causes</i><br>
<i>&gt; structural change (and by your definition is OK to be called that as its</i><br>
<i>&gt; not normal), but long-term mood changes probably cause similar up or down</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulation of specific neurotransmitters. Aren't mood changes part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal functioning? Just because the change is occurring at a level we</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't detect doesn't mean that it isn't structural, and it certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't mean we won't have the technology to detect such changes in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future.</i><br>

<p>
As I said, it might not even exist a good way of distinguishing
between "structural" or "functional" changes. Your point is right;
there isn't really any distinction between "software" (psychology) and
"hardware" (neurology).

<p>
<a href="1346.html#1372qlink4">&gt; Nikos Logothesis has done nice work training up macaques on unique</a><br>
<i>&gt; wireframe objects (basically distorted coathangers). He finds that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; infereotemporal cortex (IT) that, just like the infamous face cells</i><br>
<i>&gt; detected there, the macaques develop wireframe coathanger cells. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not just a functional change, but a long-term structural change in the part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the brain associated with object recognition.</i><br>

<p>
Beautiful!
