True. Since heaven is supposed to be a place to aspire to belong after death,
people feel it is wrong to want to avoid going there. Wanting to be immortal
is kind of a cosmic truancy, or failure to appear for Judgement, to such
people. A damnable crime. Besides that, others who try to be modest get
survivor guilt that people that they think are better then they are die. Of
course most people feel the same way about other people who cheat on their
taxes (of course, not themselves). This could be a good way to spread a
pro-immortality meme: Its your life, you earned it, for nature to want to take
it back when you are not done with it is nothing but taxation without
representation. Viva la revolucione! Lets go throw some Hemlock in the harbor!
