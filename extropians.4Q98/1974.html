<p>
 At least as good as eyewitness testimony by people who know how to lie.

 I hope I can upload before many people can change their DNA at will.

 5 years? Maybe the rich will be able to do this then, but for the average
crook it doesn't sound believable.

<p>

<p>
 Making selective enforcement of those laws much easier for defendants to
prove. How long will the laws survive that? (I'm thinking of Brin's
surveillance state - I'm not sure about den Otter's).

<p>
<a href="1893.html#1974qlink5">&gt;Frankly, this whole thread seems to come from people whose concept of </a><br>

<p>
 The surveillance state might be able to track him from the time he
kidnaps you until he gets to his house (or wherever he makes the switch),
and notice that 2 people went into the house and only 1 came out.
 In the society you would prefer, how will you deal with this situation?
