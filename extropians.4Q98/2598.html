<p>
	Suppose your risk was average -- 1 in 160 per year-- and this
risk remains constant over the next 50 years (a ridiculous assumption,
of course, but let's run with it).  The chance you escape violent
crime this year is 159/160.<a name="2625qlink1">  The chance you escape it for 2 year
straight is 159/160 * 159/160, because we're assuming every year's
risk is independent of the past.  The chance you escape for 50 years
is:

<pre>
	159
	--- to the 50th power = 0.7309  or 73%
	160

	100% - 73% = 27%.</a>

	(Note, you are more likely to get in a serious car accident.)</a>

<a name="2621qlink2">	Given the 240-to-1 murders-to-executions ratio in 1997, you
</pre>
and I were more likely to be a victims of a violent crime, than a
murderer is of being executed.

<p>
	That's how frivolous I think most arguments over the death
penalty are, pro- or con- or whatever.</a>
