My book references several people who frequent this list.  In addition, I've
tentatively selected a few people from this list to review the book prior to
printing (the people whom I've quoted will, of course, have a chance to
review my descriptions of their viewpoints to ensure I've captured their
perspective accurately.) I even have a budget to pay these reviewers! Not
enough to quit your day job but certainly enough to beef up your own
library. :)

<p>
Damien mentioned _The Spike_ sold 5,000 in Australia. I think that's an
outstanding run for book exploring the Singularity concept.  My publisher
has tentatively set the initial print run for my book at 100,000.  I'm
hoping the timing of the book's release, around 11/99 to 4/00, will bolster
demand for the book as everyone begins to "future think" more.  As for the
<a name="2059qlink1">title of the book, I've had the hardest time developing a title for the
book.  Its an arduous process because you want a title that conveys the
book's subject yet also is accessible to the average layperson.</a>

<p>
Maybe I'll have a contest at some point in the near future an offer a prize
for the best title. :)
