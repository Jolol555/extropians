<i>&gt; the human body is a technological acheivement in and of itself.</i><br>

<p>
Not to mention it would violate conservation theorems...

<p>
But actually I don't think this would cause you to travel backwards in
time.  Although the individual particles might be thought of as
travelling backwards in some theoretical sense, the larger system's
arrow of time will be determined by entropy and not by the nature of
its particles.

<p>
If you crowd antimatter particles into the left half of a sealed chamber,
they will expand to fill the chamber just like regular matter does.
The system changes to increase its entropy.  The same thing happens in
our bodies, as chemical and physical reactions occur.  Two copies of
the body, one made of antimatter and one of regular matter, should
evolve in parallel (modulo some esoteric asymmetries between the
two kinds of matter).
