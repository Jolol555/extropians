Abstract
<br>
  Two populations with high risk primary liver cancer (PLC), one of 226 cases
  with HBsAg carriers and another of 3849 first-relatives in the pedigree with
  high incidence of PLC, were randomly divided into the supplementing
  selenium group (selenium
<br>
  yeast 200 g Se1Tab/day) and the control group (common
  yeast 1 Tab/day), and were followed-up for four years and
  two years respectively. In the population with HBsAg carriers, no liver
  cancer occurred in the supplementing selenium group; where
  as the liver cancer incidence rate was 1573.03/10(5) in the control group.
  Among the first relatives. The liver cancer incidence rate in the
  supplementing selenium group was 219.37/10(5); and
  553.15/10(5) in the control group. The results showed that the incidence of
  PLC in the supplementing selenium group was significantly
  lower than in the control group. This study indicates that
  selenium has distinct anti-PLC effect.
