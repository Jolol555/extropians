Well DUH!

<p>
Lemme see...a corporation is.....what?

<p>
Hmmmm...it's an organization funded by the selling of shares.  Thence
shareholders. Who receive dividends (assuming profitability) or suffer losses
(assuming un-profitability)..  And whom might they be?  It seems that they
just MIGHT BE those very same "average americans".  What do you know?

<p>
The idea that a business (corporation, sole proprietership or partnership)
pays ANY kind of taxes is incorrect.  Taxes to a business is just another form
of expense.  It is added together with all the other expenses and  "passed on"
to the end consumer.

<p>
The ONLY ONE who pays taxes is the "average american"

<p>
No other way it CAN be.

<p>
DUH.
