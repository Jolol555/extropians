Hmm.  I fear I detect a touch of double-think or evasion in your complaint,

Why shouldn't he?  It's a notion very familiar to readers of Varley and
Bujold.  &gt;H thinkers and writers often project such variants as options,
usually not marked as dystopian but rather the reverse.  He might have
added sex changes, increased brain size and other modifications regularly
canvassed here and in sf.  So as far as I can see, your only reason to
object to this suggestion is that he *disapproves*.</a>  That might be annoying
(although surely you would expect *some* people to disapprove, and to need
some cogent argument to change their prejudiced minds), but his scenario is
hardly laughable.

This is all too easy to project.<a name="0592qlink7">  If cloning is made prohibitively
expensive, only the rich (already a de facto aristocracy) will have the
</a>option.  Instead of taking their chances in the reshuffle lottery, some of
them might choose to clone the brightest, most aggressively successful and
most beautiful of their number.</a>  That's perhaps laughable because we
already know that human cloning will probably *not* be *prohibitively*
expensive, any more than heart transplants are.  But it won't be cheap,
either - all that fiddly in vitro-to-in vivo stuff - so I can easily
imagine its adoption being pretty much restricted to the upper middle class
and above.

<p>
I think we need to give the opposition their due, and come up with strong
arguments why their fears are either groundless or can be allayed by the
choices of an educated, alert and non-hysterical citizenry.
