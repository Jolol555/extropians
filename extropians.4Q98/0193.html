Abstract
<br>
  The effects of tomato juice on urinary
  bladder carcinogenesis were studied in male Fischer 344 rats initiated with
  N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) in rats. The animals (6 weeks
  old) were given 0.05% BBN in their drinking water for 8 weeks, followed by
  diluted tomato juice for 12 weeks, and
  killed at 20 weeks after the beginning of the experiment. Lycopene
  concentrations in the livers of rats given tomato
  juice were elevated. Histopathological analysis of urinary
  bladder lesions revealed the numbers, but not incidences, of urinary bladder
  transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) to be decreased in the group given
  tomato juice. No influence on the incidence
  of simple and nodullopapillary hyperplasias, invasion or differentiation of
  TCC was noted. These results indicate that tomato
  juice, presumably the contained lycopene and other
  anti-oxidants in combination, exerts an inhibitory effect on the development
  of TCCs in the rat urinary bladder.
