I'm absolutely NOT off the doomsday scenario type, but I wanted to
theorize that IF time travel is possible, and IF it is something that we
can conceive in any capacity in the future, it's quite possible we've
never seen a time traveler because humanity doesn't survive long enough
to reach the point in thought where we can conceive of a way to travel
through time.  OR, on the same token, we advance well enough that
mentally that when we do discover time travel, we're ALL mature enough
not to take this technology into the past?.  OR someone in the future
changed something in the past that will make us not reach time traveling
technology until a certain point where we've reached "maturity".  In any
case, I'm wondering if anyone has any evidence to prove that we with
either should or shouldn't detect time travel?
