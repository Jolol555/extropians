Then you just have to deal with the police state you created in order to
"prevent child abuse"; remember, about 2/3 of the Waco warrant was about
"child abuse", even though no evidence had been found by the local 
authorities and it was entirely outside the BATF's jurisdiction.</a>

<p>
Actually, I'd say they're at least as likely to push for a healthy, happy,
safe police state as the others are. Police states seem to be a healthy,
happy middle class phenomenon.
