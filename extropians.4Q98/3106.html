Some jurisdictions acknowledge the existence of stupid people and consider

In what way do these States sponsor Nestlé local distribution?

Interesting conspiracy theory.

<p>
I find it more probable that these "liberals" simply follow their ideology.

<p>
People in the U.S.A. might consider that ideology a conspiracy, however,
with the whole political scene in the U.S.A. being more rightwing than e.g.
the European.
