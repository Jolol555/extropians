<i>&gt; Yes, that's obvious. But cooperation does not equate to coercion; the two</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3137qlink1">If by "coercion" you mean giving up some of your freedom so 
that cooperation with not completely like-minded people becomes
possible, than they certainly aren't mutually exclusive, but rather
a basic necessity for progress.</a> Semantically speaking,
<a name="3137qlink2">cooperation and coercion aren't mutually exclusive either, as
the former is defined as "working together to same end", not 
*voluntarily* working together to same end.</a>

It may sound silly, but it's true.<a name="3137qlink3"> It's all nice and well to be a lone 
rebel, but it doesn't really get you anywhere.</a> It's more rational to 
<a name="3330qlink1"><a name="3137qlink4">sacrifice a little freedom now, and reap unprecented autonomy later.</a></a>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;for security shall end up with neither",</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you don't do it, you won't have a society at all (bye progress, hello</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;suffering and death).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why are you assuming that we can't have a society without abrogating one</i><br>
<i>&gt; another's freedom?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3137qlink5">Because one person's freedom is another person's oppression.</a> At the
<a name="3137qlink6">very least you can't allow people to steal, rape, murder, pollute and 
damage property freely.</a> Due to human nature it is currently impossible
to create a non-coercive society.
