<p>
Yes.

<p>
<a href="0485.html#0490qlink2">&gt; I agree. However, nanotech is not the only way to get there. For</a><br>
<i>&gt; example, I claim that strong AI also results in posthumanity, so</i><br>

<p>
About this I am not so sure.  While strong AI *may* result
in posthumanity, I think that positive feedback with a cycle
time of weeks or months would be required (or even days...).
This would require an AI that was already vastly more 
intelligent than we are, and it is this that I am not sure of.
Is such a thing even possible?  Might it be that the system
which our brains use for intelligence/consciousness simply
cannot scale up?  The only evidence I can show for such a
hypothesis is mental illness.  So far as I am aware, other
animals do not become insane, but humans do.  (This is rambling
on, and I am not certain enough of my subject to be coherent,
so I'll shut up now.) 

<p>
<a href="0485.html#0490qlink3">&gt; even in the unlikely event that nanotech should prove to be infeasible,</a><br>
<i>&gt; that won't prevent the advent of posthumanity. Incidentally, I don't see</i><br>
<i>&gt; how nanotech self-replication results in posthumanity in days or weeks</i><br>
<i>&gt; unless it gets there by a massive increase in computing capacity resulting</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a massive increase in the intelligence of some computer-augmented or</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer-based intelligence. But, the existance of a such an intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; can easily result in nanotech in days or weeks.</i><br>

<p>
I do not insist that posthumans be more intelligent than humans,
only that they are recognizably more than human. 
The fastest path to posthumanity, AFAICS, is a copy-upload of
one of the people working on the subject.  Nanotech would seem
to allow that within days of a replicating assembler.  Such a
copy could then speed up by a factor of at least a hundred,
rendering it far more capable of controlling its environment
than are we.
