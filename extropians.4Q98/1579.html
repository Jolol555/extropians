 Thanks to Tim for the cite on the Throwing Madonna hypothesis.

 	I don't know if I buy it either, but of the available prospects, it is
the
<br>
 only one with any viable leads.  There must have been some strong
selection
<br>
 pressure towards right handedness at some point in our not too distant
 ancestors.  But answering this question is almost as bad as asking why all
 biological molecules are dextro-chiral (too much lost data in the
 intervening time span and it may have been a haphazard accident anyway).

 	It matters to me in the sense that I have a deep need to understand why
all the parts work as they do and how they got there in the first place
from a biological engineering standpoint (especially where the mind is
concerned). The adaptability of an organism is by far its strongest trait
in determining its survial.  Any clues that past adaptation may provide are
guideposts for the engineers of Homo sapiens sapiens 2.0 etc.

<i> &gt;The big thing is that the world is constructed as generative objects on</i><br>
&gt; the left and as synthetic spatial maps on the right.
 
<p>
 This statment and your subject title reminds me of another question I've
being
<br>
 meaning to ask of a biological mathematician.  Any professors to this
title
<br>
 on this list?  (pun intended).  As organisms (or any system for that
 matter) become more complex they show an increasing degree of body plan
 lateralization.  Is this simply because there is more opportunity for loss
 of symmetry and division of labor?  I suspect compexity theory would have
 something to say about the reasons and the likelihood for a biological
 system to develop in a nonsymetrical pattern.  Has Stewart Kauffman said
 anything on this matter?  Any comments?    Peter
