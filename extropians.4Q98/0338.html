Oh, I dunno...

<p>
<a href="0332.html#0338qlink2">&gt; Consider: if we were develop backwards time travel at some point in the</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0372qlink1">OK, I can follow you so far: if you return to the past of
yourself, you were always part of that past.  However, if
we introduce the idea of "Many Worlds", another possibility
arises: that we may be able to return to a past exactly 
similar to our own, but with the addition of ourselves (the
time travelers).  The only difficulty I can see is that 
there appears to be no way to get back to the "present"</a> you
left.

<p>
<a href="0332.html#0338qlink3">&gt; Thus, due to the very nature of time travel, if it hasn't happened already,</a><br>
<i>&gt; we can safely assume that it never will.</i><br>

<p>
Even this is a very weak argument against, since
you would have to show that it was likely that it
*hadn't* happened.
