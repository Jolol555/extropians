Yes and no.  Cloning probably not.  However, a liberal/conservative with a
high SL can still be even more dangerous.  cf. any of the various
techno-socialist schemes that occasionally get posted here and elsewhere.
Insert old sayings about technology and morality here.

I'd rather have a libertarian with SL0 running the country than a fascist
w/ SL4+.

<p>
<a href="0953.html#0960qlink3">&gt;President Cl*nt*n banned it because cloning is SL2 and President Cl*nt*n</a><br>
is SL0.

<p>
I think he banned cloning because he's an authoritarian with SL0.  If he
were an authoritarian with SL2, he would have made it only available with
gov't license and supervision.  Interestingly enough, however, a rational
libertarian wouldn't have banned cloning at all, no matter WHAT their shock
level was.  (Non-initiation of force and all that.)
