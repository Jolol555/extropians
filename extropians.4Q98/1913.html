<a name="1943qlink1">Yesterday's Chicago Suntimes ran a half page article against the
death penalty. 

<p>
<a name="1941qlink1">The article was based on a movement started by the nun who was the
focus of the book and movie "Dead Man Walking." Apparently some
50,000 people have signed a pledge and carry cards in their wallets
saying they do not believe in the death penalty, and in the event
they are murdered do not want the guilty party to face the death
penalty. Actor Martin Sheen and actress Susan Sarrandon were
mentioned.

<p>
Good for them....

<p>
I just composed something I am going to take to the printers, then
sign and carry in my wallet.

                     DEATH PENALTY ADVOCATE
</pre>
In the event of my murder, the bearer of this card want's the
authorities and friends to know that they believe the death penalty
is the only appropriate punishment for the unlawful, deliberate,
and malicious killing of a fellow human being. It is my express
wish prosecutors seek, and the murderer receive, the death penalty.
