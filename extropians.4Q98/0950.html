<p>
What will be the best way to make the public transition from "atom 
style" politics to "bit style" politics?

<p>
Electronic democracy replaces the need for physical politcal 
representatives to be located in physical offices (e.g., so called 
"Office of The President in Washington D.C.).

<p>
But since the internet is not yet ubiquitous, there will continue to 
be a need for the old style public theater.

<p>
What is the best way to handle the transition?

<p>
Will there eventually be a big ceremony where the White House is 
blown up, like the scene in "Independence Day"? Or will it simply be 
turned into a museum?  Does anyone have any suggestions for how the 
ceremony of retiring the physical facilities of government should 
take place, in a manner that is not too shocking to citizens?
