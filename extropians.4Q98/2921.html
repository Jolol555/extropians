Which country? I'm an anarchist, not a statist, I don't have a country.

<p>
Uh-huh. So they destroyed a city which was built with no defence against
their attacks. Why should this have anything to do with the future where
cities are designed with defences, and/or where mobility is much easier?
You think they're going to send bombers out to firebomb EvMick's truck?

<p>
<i>&gt;You can't dodge them, </i><br>

<p>
Not in a modern fixed house, perhaps. In a future mobile home I just start
up the engine and trundle off towards the next city. If I get stuck in a
traffic queue I set up my radar-guided hypervelocity railguns, dial up
Nuke-The-Bastards, Inc and pledge $1000 for the destruction of the capital
city of whichever country attacked us, then sit back and watch the fireworks.

<p>
Again, aircraft aren't the problem, bombs are the problem, and bombs can
be shot down.

<p>
You're really stuck in the 20th century, you know. Hasn't it ever occured
to you that an anarcho-capitalist society might, like, be a little bit
different to a modern society?
