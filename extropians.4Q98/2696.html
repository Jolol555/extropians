Subject: IQ test question? (Greetings :-) )

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2674.html#2696qlink1">&gt;    I've never taken a direct "IQ Test" in my 22 years of existance,</a><br>
<i>&gt;and I was wondering is there any time in the standard U.S.A</i><br>
<i>&gt;school system (K-12) that I would have been fed an actual</i><br>
<i>&gt;"accepted" IQ test? -- and if so, can I get the results?.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Thanks.</i><br>

Results of IQ tests that are administered should be available 
to you now that you're "of age".  Just show up and demand 
them but it'll probably have to be in person, I imagine. If you
want an IQ test at this point, seek out a School Psychologist 
who does intelligence testing on a regular basis (call your 
local school district). Or if you've taken the SAT, LSAT, 
<a name="2698qlink1">MCAT, etc., you may be able to find some correlation values
with the WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) IQ scores.</a>  
There are some on-line IQ tests but they're only rough 
estimates, of course.  They're much more valid when 
administered one-on-one (or so they tell me).

<p>
Keep in mind though that IQ tests are broken down into 
Verbal and Performance domains, and as Natasha was 
saying, there may be such a thing as multiple intelligences.
Even so, it is my understanding that Gardner's theories are
not gaining broad support.<a name="2704qlink1">  Robert Sternberg appears to 
be "the man" when it comes to intelligence theories in 
contemporary psychology.
