<p>
If our internal clocks are controllable such that we can slow our
perception of time down, then things can work. Also remember that sublight
speeds are not a limit on interstellar travel. They make it actually rather
easy for anyone with sufficient energy technology. As long as you can
accelerate constantly for a year or so at 1 G, then you can reach the
.95-.99 C speed range where time really starts to slow down significantly,
so even thousand or million light year journeys can take a short amount of
subjective time for the traveler. The only problem is the dilation will
tend to separate the individual traveler from others who are not traveling
in a similar causal frame. The idea of outliving family and freinds who
stay behind by hundreds or thousands of years does not seem to appeal to
most people, so they think that its not practicable as a means of space
travel.

<p>
For an extropian, though, it should go in stride. If you plan on being
immortal and being with people who are immortal, then the prospect of being
many years out of step with others is not so daunting.

<a href="2276.html#2286qlink2">&gt; In other words, 500,000 years from now when I decide to travel to Star</a><br>
<i>&gt; X which is 1500 light years away, taking me, let's say 3000 years to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get to (conservatively of course), will I bother getting bored?  3000</i><br>
<i>&gt; years is .06% of 500,000 years.  I'm about 30 years old now and .06%</i><br>
<i>&gt; of my life span is .18 years or a little more than two months -</i><br>
<i>&gt; assuming my math is right - is it?</i><br>

<p>
Accelerating at a constant 1 g to the halfway point, and decellerating at
1g the rest of the way to the destination will allow you to make the
journey in somewhere around ten years or less.

<p>
<a href="2276.html#2286qlink3">&gt; My question is, would 3,000 years feel like just a couple of months to</a><br>
<i>&gt; a being more than a half-million years old?  Is there any way to know?</i><br>

<a name="2311qlink1">I think that we all still experience time at the same rate no matter how
much is behind or ahead of us.</a> Learning to slow down our own perception of
<a name="2311qlink3">time, either by a metabolic shift or by changing electronic clocks if we
are uploaded, is the key to such a change as you describe.</a> Notice that

ten minutes tends to zip right by a senior citizen....</a>
