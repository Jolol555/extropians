Don't count your chickens. The state Duma just tabled the treaty ratification vote
until I beleive February, as they were ticked off over the iraq bombing we did. Funny
thing is that their own arsenal is supposedly failing so fast that they now have less
usable nukes than that treaty stipulates, while we still have our START I treaty
quantities and won't draw them down till the Duma ratifies their end of the treaty.
Makes you wonder what the heck they were thinking..... assuming that they are capable
of that function. An overly generous assumption as far as I can see.
