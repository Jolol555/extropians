<p>
<a href="1572.html#1580qlink1">&gt; We've been building peer-processor datacomms swithces since I designed</a><br>
<i>&gt; the architecture for our first one in 1985. I do try to keep up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; this stuff. Please beleive me when I say that the networking isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly hard. The problem is in task assignment and task migration.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Note that when the computers are all in the same room, there are cheaper</i><br>
<i>&gt; ways to build a Beowulf than by using ether-switches. In particular,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if the comuters are arranged in a grid, each computer can use two 100BaseT</i><br>
<i>&gt; cards instead of one. In this arrangement each computer can act as a crosspoint</i><br>
<i>&gt; for its row and column, switching on average only as many packets as it</i><br>
<i>&gt; originates or terminates. This gives you massive, incrementally expandble</i><br>
<i>&gt; bandwidth for approximately $50/node.</i><br>

<p>
Do you have much knowledge of radio telemetry and digital 
amplification?  I'm wondering if it would be possible to build</a> a
generic wireless computing box that is capable of autonegotiating an
optimal datacast hierarchy.  In other words, using wireless signaling,
have the boxes self-organize so that some data is being broadcast to
all other boxes, and some data is being point-cast between boxes.  

<p>
<a name="1596qlink2">As far as "task migration", couldn't you have the tasks 
"automagically" balance by having them transferred between processing 
nodes directly through the air?</a>

<p>
<a name="1596qlink3">I'm not sure what the state of the art is in high-resolution 
high-speed gain amplification, but it seems that you could have a 
signalling system that doesn't pollute the electromagnetic spectrum, 
but is sufficiently intelligent to carry traffic across large areas.</a>

<p>
<a name="1596qlink4">Would it be possible to have a large supercomputer made up of such
nodes, such that the same devices could also be a wireless
telecommunications infrastructure, at the same time as being a
distributed computing system?

<p>
You could make it such that you mass produce the boxes (with 
superscalar RAM), to achieve the lowest possible per unit cost.</a>
