Well, I'm a blasè kind of person, as well as relatively young, so I
can't really tell you that any book has _changed_ my life... but some of
the books that have made an impact on my life are:


<UL>
  <li>  _Contact_, Carl Sagan
  <li>  _A Brief History of Time_, Stephen Hawkings
  <li>  _Shröedinger's Cat_, John Gribb[io]n. By now, you might have perceived
a pattern developing, eh? Stick with me.
  <li>  _Mage: the Ascension_, Second Edition, Phil Brucato and Someone Else
Whose Name I Cannot Seem to Remember Right Now
  <li>  _Unproving the False Religion of Evolution_ - for sheer humor value.
It's available on the net, I just can't find it right now.
  <li>  _...And the Bible Was Right!_, Werner Keller. Before I read this I was
a die-hard atheist who bashed the Christians and their Holy Babble at
every opportunity.
									Now I'm just a die-hard atheist who bashes the Christians at
every opportunity. Go figure.
  <li>  _Broca's Brain_, Carl Sagan
  <li>  _The Dragons of Eden_, Carl Sagan. I'm sorry, but Carl Sagan is my
hero. I can't help it.



</UL>

Peace,

"So, do you think you can tell heaven from hell? Blue skies and pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell, or did they get you to trade your heroes for
ghosts, hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for
change? And did you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role
in a cage?"
