<a name="1659qlink1"><a name="1583qlink1">A whole while ago we were talking about personal data/document management.
This has become especially relevant to me since I've had to move a lot in
the course of the last two years -- and resources I can't access are useless.

<p>
Albeit belatedly, I am happy to report to having begun destillation of
my music CDs into mp3s. It's slow, and I can't batchify it yet, but
it's a start. With 128 kBit, which is roughly CD quality one averages
at about 1 MByte/min audio. On a 10 GByte disk you thus can store
~160 CDs or about 7 days of audio. With a laptop, or a wearable,
you're even mobile.

<p>
Unfortunately, I haven't managed in creating a capability to scan
personal books whether as bitmap or using OCR in time before my next
move -- a lot of books will thus have go into storage, and probably
not under ambient conditions :(

<p>
Has anybody experiences in converting treekiller literature into data,
particularly under SANE/Linux? (I'm not a zealot, I have</a> FineReader
and NT as well, it it's of any use).

<p>
<a name="1583qlink2">Is it doable, or a pipe dream? 

<p>
</a>How long do you take for a single book on the average?</a> 

<p>
<a name="1583qlink3">Did you do straight bitmaps or went for the whole hog (OCR)?</a> 

<p>
<a name="1598qlink1"><a name="1583qlink4">What is your storage medium?</a> 
</a>
<p>
Retrieval method?

<p>
<a name="1583qlink5">Migration strategy to future storage media?</a>

thanks,
