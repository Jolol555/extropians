This doesn't seem to cohere.  For a good portion of America's history the
United States had no gun laws.  It was still a gov't, wasn't it?  Wouldn't
it still be a gov't if it "respected the citizens' right to defend
themselves?"  What exactly would that entail?

<p>
What exactly is the difference between a local gov't and a local PPF?
