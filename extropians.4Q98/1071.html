<a name="1081qlink4">For example, when a primitive female human was having her period, she would be
sequestered from the rest of the tribe, to the point that females prefered the
privacy. Do that for thousands of years and women are going to feel very private
about their reproductive health. I could go on and describe many other
evolutionary advantages to privacy.</a>
