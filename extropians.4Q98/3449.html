The only "destabilizing influence" I remember was forcing Britain out of the
crazy Exchange Rate Mechanism, for which many British businesspeople were
extremely grateful. It was killing the British economy, and he saved it;
that it destabilized the government's plans is irrelevant.

Of course these days he's arguing for more stupid government tricks, whether
that's so he can make lots of money or because he really thinks they might
work, I don't know.
