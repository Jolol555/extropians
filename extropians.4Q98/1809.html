I think that in merely 'reading' and 'recommending' such books, we miss
their true potential.  Postrel's book contains ideas which we are already
familiar, expressed in a form that everyone can relate to.  We should be
*citing* her work in essays and books that we write.  We need to find works
to which we can link our ideas, to show that transhumanist thought functions
as part of an intellectual progression, not just a set of ideas floating
around on the fringes, totally disconnected.  

<p>
By crediting other authors for their work on such ideas, and including it in
our own works, we increase our credibility and our profile.  It also helps
us to forge networks with people who would support at least some of our
ideas.  In every topic that we discuss, we should be aware of a set of works
that are good sources of citations and use them.

<p>
Sin,
