<i>&gt;     &gt;our history would constantly be changing around us by large magnitudes.</i><br>

Another way to disprove it is to look at the sky. Since relativity restricts such timeline shifts to
local space, then we should be seeing large sections of the universe changing constantly in front of us
by large amounts. Stars, clusters, nebula, and galaxies should move, morph, and pop in and out of
existence all the time. Since the don't then Many Worlds is bunk.
