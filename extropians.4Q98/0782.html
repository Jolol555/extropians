Sure but you could use the same logic to the use of gengineered infectious viruses as a
means of widespread improvement of the gene pool. Its still a very dangerous idea. If I
knew of another transhuman who was using such liberated technology I'd nuke the guy on
general principles.

I don't beleive that the risk is less costly than the purported worth of the
improvement in competetiveness.  Far to the opposite in fact.
