enabling the imbiber to take very different perspectives. Among all the
silly ideas I've had under the influence, I've also had some valuable
insights and forceful reminders of things I already knew but was not paying
enough attention to. However, these substances don't make you change--the
hard work of altering yourself for the better based on these insights remains.

<p>
I'm sure that the reduction of my enthusiasm for psychedelics has nothing
to do with fear of the tribe. Back when I was using LSD, I remember an
occasion when, accompanying a non-altered friend, I walked calmly and
confidently between two uniformed policemen to enter a donut shop. I was
amused by the policemen clustered around the donut shop, but not concerned
about arrest since I felt in charge of myself.

<p>
I think it's unfortunate that the careful use of psychedelics is not part
of any accepted ritual in this country, as it is in some South American
countries. I saw a program recently showing the use of a mild psychedelic
as part of a weekly (or perhaps it was monthly) ritual in a church. A study
apparently showed that the users of the drug (I think it was ayahuasca)
were physically and psychologically healthy than comparable non-users. The
structure of the ritual use ensured that the drug was not overused, and
that the experience was guided.
