Actually, it was me who mentioned  the time dilation gag.

<p>
Actually, that would be at a higher than normal G level. At 1 G constant thrust
you would have gone .7 light years in a year...a 2 G acceleration would do it
to AC in 1.4 years, but I don't know many people who could stand 2 Gs for a
whole year....

Yeah, the only downside is that it will take 9 hours to receive 1 hour of South
Park transmissions from Earth.....damn, better stock up ahead of time....

<a href="2411.html#2429qlink4">&gt; Of course, as others have pointed out, this isn't particularly efficient;</a><br>

<p>
The only thing that bugs me about going slow and sleeping through it is that
since you aren't accelerating at any appreciable G level, you will either have
to deal with cardiovascular and bone degeneration caused by long term low G
exposure, or have a rotating hull. A rotating hull puts in other problems: long
term exposure to such tight coriolis forces permanently messes up your sense of
balance, since your ears will adjust to the new environment, but won't adjust
all the way back when you are finished. If you are using a Bussard Ramjet as
your propulsion system, then the rotating habitat will generate all sorts of
induction currents passing through the ram scoop field constantly.

<p>
Yes, it would be more energy efficient to go slower. However, energy does not
seem to be that big of a problem in space. Mass is the problem. Being mass
efficient in your propulsion system is what is truly important, since there
isn't much out there to refuel with.
