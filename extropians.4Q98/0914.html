<a href="0899.html#0914qlink1">&gt;Speaker Newt Gingrich (R) was a history professor, a science-fiction fan,</a><br>
even
<br>
<a href="0899.html#0914qlink2">&gt;the coauthor of an SF book.  He will not run for Speaker and will probably</a><br>
<i>&gt;resign from Congress.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Senator Patrick Moynihan (D) was one of the few highly intelligent people</i><br>
in
<br>
<a href="0899.html#0914qlink3">&gt;the Senate.  He will not run for reelection in 2000.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The shepherds are gone, and with them the last vision beyond the next</i><br>
<i>&gt;election.  Now the hungry, snuffling pigs rule with their bellies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Chris Cox, who is running for Gingrich's old job, has been favourably
evaluated by Reason magazine, so I think there are still some brains in
Congress. The former wrestler who was elected Governor under the Reform
party ticket, is by according to many accounts, a libertarian who favours
gay marriage and drug legalisation.

<p>
<a name="0915qlink1">Gingrich had a genuine enthusiasm for ideas, so his departure is a great
loss.</a>
