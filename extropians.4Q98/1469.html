<a name="1499qlink1">We need to create a new OS.  We need to do it as an open source 
internet project.  We can base it on Unix, or use some other OS, 
looking to Thinking Machines, Cray, or some other parallel 
distributed system for a model to learn from.</a>

<p>
<a name="1499qlink2">The problem is simple: We're going to need to be able to program this 
massive supercomputer called "The Internet".  The broadband 
infrastructure to support distributed nonlinear video requires this.</a>

<p>
We should assume that each computing node has massively parallel DSP 
chips and gigabytes (even terabytes) of local ram.  It would be a 
good idea to keep in mind that additional nodes will be added as soon 
as they roll off the production line.  Plan for nodes with faster 
processors and ram to be added as quickly as they can be manufactured 
and added to the network.

<p>
Now what do we do?  Today is a good time to start, as these items 
will be the infrastructure necessary to keep the masses entertained, 
and scientists and engineers educated and productive.

<p>
It's probably best to think of money as being less of an object than 
human capital and time availability.  I think it would be wise *not* 
to assume that will be a commercial OS.

<p>
Let's go home and make, and watch movies.  This foolish competition 
has reached the point of diminishing returns.  We can implement a 
price freeze and use funny money if necessary.  There's plenty of 
food to go around (see <a href="http://www.adm.com/">http://www.adm.com/</a>).  Let's go home, watch 
movies, surf a broadband net with voice recognition, grow vegetables 
in the backyard (see <a href="http://www.cannabis.to/pictures/">http://www.cannabis.to/pictures/</a>), and think up 
ways to pursue life, liberty, and happiness.
