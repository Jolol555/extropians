Hi all

<p>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, contrary to what was said on another thread some weeks back,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; there seems to be a fairly substantial correlation between IQ and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; brain size. I've heard figures of correlation coefficients of up</i><br>

yip. contrary also to everyone's favourite defender of Marxist-Leninist 
science for the people Steven jay Gould.

<p>
<a href="1680.html#1733qlink2">&gt;&gt;&gt;It would be interesting to try correlate the size and</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; complexity of specific cortical areas with performance measures of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; the sort of activity they are thought to be responsible for. Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; one could find even greater coefficients then.</i><br>
That is being/has started to be done. People are looking to extract the 
factor structure of human intelligence from regional cell counts and 
gray/white matter ratios. Of course, the great bulk of IQ variance is 
explained by a single factor so these effects struggle under pretty hefty 
signal to noise ratio.

<p>
<a href="1723.html#1733qlink3">&gt;&gt; This is probably a stupid question, but how to explain this Brain</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; size/I.Q correlation if we admit that the I.Q level has</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; significantly risen in one century?</i><br>

<p>
One answer (proposed by Jim Flynn, in fact, is that intelligence hasn't 
risen, while IQ has).

<p>
then Remi Sussan said (in reply to nick):
<br>
<a href="1723.html#1733qlink4">&gt; &gt;A .4 correlation leaves a huge scope for other factors, so I </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;don't see any difficulty here.</i><br>

<p>
difficulty for what: dualist theories on mind?

<p>
<i>&gt;(It's also possible to imagine that</i><br>
<a href="1723.html#1733qlink5">&gt;better nourishment during childhood could have increased average brain</a><br>
<i>&gt;size.)</i><br>
That proposal has been tested by the late HJ Eysenck, with some success.

<p>
<a href="1723.html#1733qlink6">&gt;One has to be careful before jumping to conclusions from a weak </a><br>
<i>&gt;correlation.</i><br>

<p>
umm. why so any more than with strong correlations? One actually has to 
be careful jumping to conclusions when there is no theory. There is a 
well formulated theory of why brain size and structure relates to IQ.

<p>
<a href="1723.html#1733qlink7">&gt;After all, shoe size also correlates positively </a><br>
<i>&gt;with IQ (though less than brain size I think).</i><br>

<p>
not very well at all actually. Nose size however, has a good correlation 
(around .4)

<p>
<i>&gt;Couldn't head size</i><br>
<a href="1723.html#1733qlink8">&gt;simply be correlated with body size, which in turn may be correlated</a><br>
<i>&gt;with intelligence because the best mates prefer to mate people who are</i><br>
<i>&gt;both tall and intelligent?</i><br>

<p>
That is exactly what is tested in the papers on this matter.

<p>
a nice reference is given below. There are by now, however, many dozens 
of papers on this topic. Steven jay Gould's response is simple denial: 
fitting really for such an arm chair critic.
