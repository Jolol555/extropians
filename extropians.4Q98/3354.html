Abstract
<br>
  PURPOSE: This investigation quantifies the relation between cardiorespiratory
  fitness levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
  mortality within strata of other CVD predictors. METHODS:
  Participants included 25,341 male Cooper Clinic patients who underwent a
  maximal graded exercise test. CVD death rates were determined for low (least
  fit one-fifth), moderate (next two-fifths), and high (top two-fifths)
  cardiorespiratory fitness categories by strata of smoking
  habit, blood cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and health status.
  There were 226 cardiovascular deaths during 211,996 man-years of follow-up.
  RESULTS: For individuals with none of the major CVD predictors (smoking,
  elevated resting systolic blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol), there
  was a strong inverse relation (P = 0.001) between fitness
  level and CVD mortality. An inverse relation between CVD
  mortality and fitness level was seen within
  strata of cholesterol levels and health status. No evidence of a trend (P =
  0.60) for decreased mortality was seen across
  fitness levels for individuals with elevated systolic blood
  pressure; however, a strong inverse gradient (P &lt; 0.001) was seen across
  fitness levels for individuals with normal systolic blood
  pressure. There was a tendency for association between high levels of
  fitness and decreased CVD mortality in
  smokers compared with low and moderately fit smokers (P &lt; 0.076). There was
  no significant association between level of fitness and CVD
  mortality for individuals with multiple (two or more)
  predictors (P = 0.325). Approximately 20% of the 226 CVD deaths in the
  population studied were attributed to low fitness level.
  CONCLUSIONS: Moderate and high levels of cardiorespiratory
  fitness seem to provide some protection from CVD
  mortality, even in the presence of well established CVD
  predictors.
