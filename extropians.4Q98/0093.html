 Sorry Joe! Joe was the first negative experience that I've run into with
that technique. I've written him directly with more info on that technique
and its use both by me and the many patients I've used it on over the
years. ( Oh, by the way Spike, I'm not an MD, but I have worked in many
capacities in the health care field over the last thirty years, presently
I earn a buck by doing MRI scans).
<br>
Sarah Marr's    "Go wash your Alcor braclet" is the funniest thing that
I've read on the Net in a long time. Must be a truely awkened mind behind
that one.
<br>
There is a statue of  a "Laughing Buddha" by the cash register of my
favorite Asian restaurant. It never fails to remind me of the lack of such
a representation among the icons of other major religions. They all preach
joy, but a picture, or statue, in this case is worth far more that all
their stacks of dogma and pious attitudes.
  If I manage to achieve any significant personal longevity, wether it be
decades or eons, the time will be far more meaningful because of Zen.
