<a name="2518qlink1">THe funny thing is that the more socialist a country is, the more</a> people who
<a name="2518qlink2">fall off the bottom and stay in the poverty class. Since taxation adds an
incredible amount to an individual's cost of living, it follows</a> that in a high
<a name="2518qlink3">tax socialist environment, more people will fall below the poverty</a> level because
<a name="2518qlink4">the measured 'market basket' of goods and services is inflated</a> by those high
<a name="2518qlink5">taxes at all levels of production and distribution.</a>

<p>
Its been calculated that if taxation were eliminated here in the US that the
cost of living for the current standard of living would drop by some 60%. I
imagine that this percentage is even higher in more socialist countries. This
would automatically raise 90%+ of the people who supposedly live below the
poverty line up to middle class status, because they can now afford a decent
standard of living.

<p>
<a name="2518qlink6">Yes there will still be people who fall off the bottom of the system,</a> people
<a name="2518qlink7">become drunks, drug addicts, or suffer accidents without</a> sufficient insurance,
<a name="2518qlink8">or are dependents of people who do so. That, sir, is life.</a> Now, if we could cure
<a name="2518qlink9">everyone who has predispositions toward drug and alcohol abuse I think that
would go a long way toward ending this problem, since most poverty</a> and crime  is
<a name="2518qlink10">drug and alcohol related.</a> But that is a medical problem, not an economics
problem. The economics are merely symptoms of the medical.
