Ok, now I understand. You really should work on clarity of expression,
Samael. Saying "every method is silly" is vastly different from saying
"faithfully adhering to one method is silly".

<p>
That aside, I don't believe there's a "perfect" system either. That's a red
herring.

<p>
<a name="2955qlink1">The question is not "which system is perfect", but "which system works".
This is the contention on the table: by overwhelming evidence as well as
theory, market freedom works (best), and no alternative works (nearly as
</a>well).

<p>
Studying basic economics is enough to convince me on theoretical grounds;
looking around at the world and reading history convinces me on empirical
grounds.

<p>
This is what you need to argue against. Instead you throw up a strawman
("libertarians claim to have a perfect system") which is all too easy to
knock down.

<p>
You haven't addressed this. Where is your "compassion" if you believe in
coercing others to implement your opinions?

<p>
Of course "natural" disasters are nobody's fault. The question is how well
people are prepared to respond to them. Governmentalism stifles the ability
to recover, by subverting market allocation processes.

<p>
As to incursions from neighboring states, *of course* that's the fault of
"government" (probably including their "own"). Almost all wars are quarrels
between states, no?

In response to my observing your seeming support of short-term over
long-term gain, you wrote:
<br>
<a href="2911.html#2946qlink10">&gt;Nope, because educating those people will get them to the same stage, in a</a><br>

<p>
Gee, I thought people were too stupid to be educated...? [wicked grin]
You're not scoring high on the consistency meter today. I don't understand
what point you're trying to make here. Please clarify.
