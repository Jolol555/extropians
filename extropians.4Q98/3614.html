<a name="3639qlink1"><a name="3628qlink1">I hope you don't find this depressing (despair should be left to
experts), but I'm 19 right now and I've never managed to top the
insights I had at age 16.  It may simply be that I was under far more

stress at that time and that my current level of despair isn't powerful
enough to produce that kind of output, despite my halting efforts to
focus and harvest it deliberately.  Or I may have reached a Hansonian
</a>
bottleneck.  Or I could have just lost key neurons to the aging process.
 At any rate, it takes considerably longer for me to work through a
paradox or develop a new mental discipline, months or years instead of weeks.

<p>
On the other hand, the stuff I figured out at age 16 - "Algernon's Law",
for example - is probably enough to reach the Singularity, so perhaps I
shouldn't complain.

<p>
I have hopes that I'll be able to repair any problems and far surpass
myself during the Age of the Neurohackers, which should start in a few
years for early adopters and about 10 years for everyone else.  Of
course it may take considerably longer if I get hit by a truck.  (David
Pearce is arguably already the First Neurohacker in an age that started
with Prozac, but as a Singularitarian (and the Second Neurohacker) I
should prefer to start counting from the time of intelligence
enhancement and localized alteration of specific brain areas.)
