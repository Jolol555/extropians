<a href="1390.html#1476qlink2">&gt;I see "reliable aggregate differences" as a fact. But "meaningful social</a><br>
<i>&gt;outcomes" sounds like an opinion to me. </i><br>

<p>
You are right that "meaningful social outcomes" is opinion. I made the 
mistake of being relativist.

<p>
To decide if you think they are important, decide whether you think that 
explaining variance in income, crime, solo-parenting, education, etc 
matters. If it does then race matters.

<p>
however, I recall having an argument with Phil Rushton at a conference 
where I argued the opposite: that race DOESN'T matter. It went as follows

<p>
The Bell Curve proposition is essentially that all observed racial 
differences are infact IQ proxies and that partially out IQ leaves no 
racism. In words, that means that current racial differences are entirely 
exlained by IQ and that Occam's Razor would suggest that we use just the 
one more general variable rather than keeping both. Race in this case 
could be viewed as an evolutionary or historical explanatory variable 
rather than a contemporary causal agent.

The next time some academics tell you how important "diversity" is, ask 
how many Republicans there are in their sociology department.
