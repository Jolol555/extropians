  IAN: Apart from inflammatory talk of a global conspiracy 
  to oppress the masses with zero and personal attacks on 
  me, I have not seen any logical support for your views 
  on zero. I even raised several questions about your 
  claims which you have systematically ignored. 

<p>
  Of those questions, perhaps the most relevant are: 
  What is the definition of change you imply that does 
  not employ zero? And: How is change measured free from 
  differentiation from a state of no (i.e., of zero) change?
