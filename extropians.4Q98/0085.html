Thank you Doug Bailey for some thoughtful comments!

<a name="0088qlink1">It is easier to get more variation in growth rates with endogenous
growth models, and there is also less consensus on how to model 
endogenous growth.  So to avoid the accusation that I cooked my big
growth speedup implications, I choose to use exogenous growth.
This may provide a conservative estimate of growth implications.
But yes, it would be interesting to try the simplest endogenous
growth model, which I think is the AK model.</a>

<p>
<a href="0075.html#0085qlink2">&gt;Another area that might warrant further review is the neo-classical</a><br>
<i>&gt;idea of diminishing returns. I know Paul Romer alleged that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;diminishing returns problem might not apply if capital was expanded</i><br>
<i>&gt;to include human capital. </i><br>

<p>
This isn't another area.  The essense of endogenous growth models
is that they eliminate diminishing returns.  

<p>
<a name="0088qlink2"><a href="0075.html#0085qlink3">&gt;What impact might a drastically increased</a><br>
<i>&gt;efficiency in capital utilization have on growth models? How would this</i><br>
<i>&gt;potential effect of AI-development be factored in to growth models?</i><br>

<p>
Unless you forsee particular reasons to expect a change in the *rate*
at which such utilization becomes more efficient, this effect is already
included in the standard models of exogenous growth.</a>
