<a name="0961qlink1"><a href="0951.html#0959qlink1">&gt;As a matter of fact, thin-film amorphous Si photocell radios with</a><br>

Can we get a few facts in here? Not all men in Afghanistan are for the
Taliban. I guess many would love to see them blown to bits. The problem is
the ultra-extremists with guns that are telling everyone else how to act.
Its not exactly like the population greeted them with great warmth when
they entered Kabul. Information for the oppressed is always a useful
commodity (whether it would have any affect on the Taliban is another
question).

<p>
No ones answered my previous question: how do you attack problems much
closer to hand. For instance the insane guys shooting doctors offering
abortions. I would have thought if you could crack the memetic set</a> of
Bible-beat Christians you would be ready to take on the World. If you can't
then any talk of changing the much more extreme (I know its hard to
believe) Taliban is just idle posturing.
