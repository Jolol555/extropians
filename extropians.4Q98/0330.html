Two simple questions which I feel will tickle your brain cells... 
Timetravel, a Transhuman possability, or just a daydream? Would it be a 
good thing, or disastrous?

<p>
I would have to answer yes to it being a possability, however far ahead 
the technology for such a thing is. I, with my limited knowledge of both 
Extropy and Timetravel (presently), do not believe we would bring about 
some disastrous outcome with the ability to time travel. On the 
contrary, we may be as ghosts, there only for the observance of whatever 
is happening and not in physical form. I'm not speaking of astral 
projection (at least not in the nature it is known to us), but if we 
were to go back or forward in Time, to break the limited bounds of our 
concept of Time, it would be to actually see it for what it is and not 
what we are taught. I think that all Time exists at one time and not on 
the three different levels of Past, Present, Future. We see it as thus 
because it is a convenience to us and our minds are limited only to what 
our senses tell it. 

<p>
What do you think?
