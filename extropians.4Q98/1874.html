<p>
Sasha,

<pre>
	All I know is what's in that NYT editorial:
	(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/editorial/30mon1.html">http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/editorial/30mon1.html</a>)

	I guess Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki will find ways to
</pre>
keep the NYSE by getting city council and legislature to finance it.

<p>
	The NYSE should have threatened to leave during the socialist
reign of Democratic Governor Cuomo (ousted in '94) and Democratic
Mayor Dinkins (ousted in '93).  It would have been a great _Atlas
Shrugged_ lesson: reminding everyone who produces the wealth.  We have
a federal "surplus" driven by bulging tax receipts from the bull
market.  Imagine the benefits to the global economy of a more
spacious, more computerized, more efficient stock exchange.

<p>
	800,000 people are still on the welfare rolls in NYC.  (1.6
times the population of Boston.)  Assuming each person costs $5,000
per year (and they surely cost more), that comes to $4 billion, over 4
times the price of the new NYSE center.

<p>
<a href="1871.html#1874qlink1">&gt;Also, why is the huge manual trading floor still needed?</a><br>
<i>&gt;I'd expect much less money would be needed to computerize the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;damn thing.</i><br>

<p>
	Perhaps NYSE should go the way of NASDAQ.

<p>
