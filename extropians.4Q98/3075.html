people. I would blame the government of those countries for sponsoring the
local distribution without putting any investment in a means of producing
potable water sources to mix in the formula, and teaching people about
hygenic practices. Another thing: the governments also knew that since
mother's milk carries antibodies that the child needs in early development
to help boost its immune system, but did not take action to remedy this by
increasing vaccinations.</a>

could have. I don't blame them for donating baby formula. The reason
liberals rail against Nestle for this incident is that they are trying to
scare private companies from doing as much charitable work as they do, so
that more responsibility will land on government organizations.</a></a></a>
