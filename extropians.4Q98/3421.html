Looks like pyrazinoylguanidine is greatly superior to aminoguanidine in
the prevention of cataracts. It might be the guanidine of choice for the
purpose of life extension as well.

Abstract
<br>
  This study was designed to determine whether pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) can
  attenuate cataract development in streptozotocin
  (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After a single, intraperitoneal dose of STZ (45
  mg/kg in 0.05 mol/l sodium citrate buffer), Sprague-Dawley rats (250-260 g)
  were divided into three groups. Beginning a week later, each group of
  diabetic rats received twice daily for 24 weeks by gavage one of the
  following: vehicle (saline 10 ml/kg), PZG (35 mg/kg), or captopril (15
  mg/kg). PZG treatment prevented the development of diabetic
  cataracts (p = 0.0009 compared to vehicle). In contrast to
  PZG, 38% of vehicle-treated rats exhibited cataracts after
  12 weeks, increasing to 89% after 16 weeks. At week 16, 22% of
  captopril-treated rats exhibited cataracts, a 75% reduction
  from vehicle-treated rats (p = 0.4289 compared to vehicle; p = 0.0571
  compared to PZG). These results indicate that captopril can attenuate
  cataract formation in STZ-diabetic rats, whereas PZG
  completely suppresses it.

Abstract
<br>
  The effect of aminoguanidine (AG), an inhibitor of advanced glycation, on the
  development of cataracts was studied in diabetic rats. Rats
  were made diabetic with streptozotocin, and based on the level of plasma
  glucose they were grouped as moderately (&lt; 350 mg dl-1 plasma glucose) and
  severely (&gt; 350 mg dl-1 plasma glucose) diabetic. One half of the animals in
  each group received AG (25 mg kg-1 body weight each day), intraperitoneally,
  starting from the day of streptozotocin injection. Progression of lens
  opacification was recorded using Fundus and Scheimpflug photography at
  regular time intervals. On the ninetieth day all the rats were killed and the
  levels of advanced glycation end products (AGE) was determined by measuring
  the non-tryptophan fluorescence of the lens soluble and insoluble fractions.
  Densitometric analysis of Scheimpflug images showed that in diabetic rats
  lens opacification progressed in a biphasic manner, an initial slow
  progression for the first 60 days, followed by a steep increase during next
  30 days. Moderately and severely diabetic rats developed lens opacities more
  or less at the same time. AGE fluorescence in the lens soluble fractions
  increased three-fold and seven-fold in the moderately and severely diabetic
  rats, respectively; whereas in insoluble fractions there was a 30% and
  three-fold increase in the moderately and severely diabetic rats,
  respectively. Although AG treatment inhibited the AGE fluorescence of lens
  soluble and insoluble fractions by about 56% and 75% in moderately diabetic
  and by 19% and 52% severely diabetic rats, respectively, the development of
  cataracts was delayed only in the moderately diabetic rats.
  These results thus suggest that the effect of AG is indeed inhibition of the
  formation of AGEs. However, in the severely diabetic rats the beneficial
  effect of AG is overwhelmed by the excessive accumulation of AGEs.

(diet seems to be important too.....)

  Food and nutrient intake and risk of cataract.

Abstract
<br>
  The relationship between cataract extraction and diet was
  considered in a case-control study conducted in northern Italy. A total of
  207 patients who had cataract extraction and 706 control
  subjects in a hospital for acute, nonneoplastic, nonoculistic, nondigestive
  tract diseases were interviewed during their hospital stay. Odds ratios (ORs)
  and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), according to the intake of alcohol,
  coffee, tea, and cola, and frequency of intake of 34 food items and 8
  micronutrients were derived from multiple logistic regression equations,
  including terms for age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index,
  diabetes, and total calorie intake. Alcohol, coffee, decaffeinated coffee,
  tea, and cola intakes were not associated with cataract
  extraction. Among food items, reduced ORs for cataract
  extraction (highest tertile of intake compared to the lowest), with a
  significant inverse trend in risk, were found for intake of meat (OR 0.6, 95%
  CI 0.4 to 0.9), cheese (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0), cruciferae (OR 0.5, 95%
  CI 0.3 to 0.8), spinach (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9), tomatoes (OR 0.5, 95% CI
  0.4 to 0.8), peppers (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.1), citrus fruit (OR 0.5, 95%
  CI 0.2 to 1.3), and melon (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8). A significant increase
  in risk was found for the highest intake of butter (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2 to
  6.4), total fat (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.8), and salt (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4 to
  4.0) compared to the lowest, and for consumption of oil other than olive oil
  (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2). Among micronutrients, lower ORs for
  cataract extraction (highest quintile of intake compared to
  the lowest) were found for intake of calcium (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8),
  folic acid (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7), and vitamin E (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to
  1.0), while estimated intakes of methionine, retinol, beta-carotene, and
  vitamins A, C, and D were not associated. Thus, this study indicates that
  diet plays a considerable role in the risk of cataract
  extraction in this Italian population, with a protective action played by
  some vegetables, fruit, calcium, folic acid,and vitamin E, and an increased
  risk associated with elevated salt and fat intake.
