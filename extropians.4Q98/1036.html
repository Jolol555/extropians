In regards to Max M's responce to my email.

<p>
	Firstly, Max, I must thank you for your point c;
<br>
<a href="1009.html#1036qlink1">&gt;c. They are unable to bring themself out of their memetic and genetic</a><br>
condition.&lt;
<p>
	It is an important point which I had failed to consider. I also
agree with you comments on the effect of people's social history;
<br>
<a href="1009.html#1036qlink2">&gt;In the old days when most Danes lived in the country there was something</a><br>
called a "bad family". A family that had been up to no good for generations.
Where the parents where loosers, drunks, beggars etc. and the kids would
grow up and be the same.&lt;
<p>
		and,
<br>
<a href="1009.html#1036qlink3">&gt;Children of people with social problems are most often those who get social</a><br>
problems themself.&lt;

<p>
	So I feel that I should clarify my position somewhat. I agree that
it is in our best interests to improve the conditions of the poor, for us
as individuals and as a whole community. What I dont agree with is the
concentration on wealthy for taxation purposes. Would it not be better to
look at other forms of less 'liberty encroaching' means, like the debit tax
system, or the carbon tax.

<p>
	Thanks, Steve.
