<i>&gt;in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the first place by encouraging them to reproduce at taxpayer expense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The government's doing that??????  Really?????</i><br>

<p>
It gets worse: In several States (US) welfare agencies have given fertility
drugs to women on assistance.
<br>
That practice has stopped, but agencies continue to subsidize  homeless
females who manage to get pregnant. -zen

<a name="2222qlink1"><i>&gt;&gt;too poor to get onto the circuit in the first place have too much time on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;their hands, and consequently have too many kids, which amplifies the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;problem in the last place.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So educate them.  Get them onto the circuit and then let them get on with</i><br>
<i>&gt;it.</i><br>

<p>
They don't want education. They want guns, drugs, sex, and your head</a> on a
stick.

<a name="2222qlink2"><a href="2207.html#2215qlink3">&gt;&gt; The free market provides a better solution by discouraging the very</a><br>
<i>&gt;poorest from having children.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or at least making sure that those children never get an education,</a> leaving</i><br>
<a name="2222qlink3"><i>&gt;a convenient underclass to do all the dirty work.</i><br>

<p>
The free market does that? Really?
<br>
I don't think so.</a>

<p>
<a href="2207.html#2215qlink4">&gt;&gt;If the free market did *not* always provide better solutions, it would not</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be necessary for governments to maintain military forces to threaten</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;haven't solved anything in the whole sad history of the race, but which</i><br>
<i>&gt;have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;produced monumental problems such as weapons of mass destruction).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gosh, now there's a slightly one-sided view of things.  The free market</i><br>
<i>&gt;generally provides the best solution, but government is dead handy for</i><br>

<i>&gt;area), welfare and (in my case) socialised medicine (which means that if I</i><br>
<i>&gt;break a leg I'm not penalised for doing it while broke).</i><br>

<p>
You mean *other* monopolies besides government. (Who has a monopoly on
printing money?)
<br>
Government "avoiding police"? "armies"? Now that qualifies as a twisted
fancy.

<p>
Sorry to post so many messages. I promise to use the Inbox Assistant more.
