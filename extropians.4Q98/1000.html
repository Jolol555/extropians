hi damien - sending this to the list as well in case i am misunderstood 
more widely.

<p>
Damien Broderick noted [off list] that a sentence in my last email is 
broken.

<p>
<a href="0999.html#1000qlink1">&gt;&gt;I guess that is because people forget that Denmark had an explicit </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;eugenics program to enhance the IQ of its population ;-) Skin heads </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;keeping out "inferior" colours of immigrant is also suggests </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;The sentence about skinheads appears to have been truncated.  I wonder if</i><br>
<i>&gt;you'd let me know what you meant to say? </i><br>

<p>
For Daniel and the wider audience, I first wrote to "... suggests that 
there is a significant facist right in denmark."

<p>
I changed my mind and wrote  "keeping out "inferior" colours of immigrant 
is not a good advertisment for Denmark."

<p>
Somehow, neither got sent. Oh well.

<p>
I was referring to a news item from earlier this year in which skinhead 
gangs were shown "standing guard" at the road entries to denmark 
"discouraging" non-whites from coming to Denmark.

<a name="1001qlink1">PS: In part, reflects of how little use is the term "right wing". As the 
late Hans Eysenck pointed out, both Stalin and Hitler were authoriatarian 
butchers, and it seems uninformative to call one left-, and the other 
right- wing. In many ways the libertarian philosophy is radical left but 
is typically characterised as radical right. The terms are of little 
value in practice. Sociology has failed, as far as I can see to give us a 
useful term.</a>

Told you "need" NT? Point them to Amazon.com and this informational site.

A quote:

<p>
For Windows 95 and NT users, one of the most popular places on the Web to 
get freeware and shareware is a site called www.windows95.com which due 
to the immense popularity of the site, requires a robust operating system 
and Web servers. Since all the software offered at this site is 
exclusively for Windows 95 or NT, and the overall flavor tends to be very 
pro Microsoft, one would assume that NT servers running IIS would be the 
logical choice for their Internet solution. Well, here's a quote from one 
of their own Web pages: What hardware and software is Windows95.com 
running on? 

<p>
We use Pentium Pro computers running the BSDI UNIX operating system with 
Apache Web server software. Our servers are connected to the Internet via 
multi-homed T3 connections. 

<p>
Note: This quote is from February 1998. They recently changed their name 
from Windows95.com to WinFiles.com although they still have use of the 
windows95.com domain name. This change transpired in March 1998.
