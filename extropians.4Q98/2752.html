No, it's about peaceful means versus armed force, at least in practice.
Socialism is just as competitive as a free market, it's just that socialist
competition is at the point of a gun rather than by consumer choice.

<p>
When cooperation is necessary, people cooperate; they don't need someone to
make them cooperate. Forced "cooperation" is not cooperation in any
meaningful sense.

<p>
Any legitimate service a government provides can be done much more
efficiently and cheaply in a free market, and without any coercion.
