ah, but you see, the survival advantage would be only for those who
evolved under those conditions of harsh dangerous winters.  s.a.d.
would not be a survival advantage to us today. likewise, in times past,
people might have a survival advantage if they had the ability to convert
their food to fat, all the better to survive winter's scarcity.  that same
advantage is to most moderns a curse, where the next meal is always as
close as the corner grocery store or mcdonalds, if not the twinkies
in our our own kitchens.

lady dlos, i sincerely hope, if i were religious i would pray, that you
manage this depression until science can hand us the cure...  spike
