What's your friend's opinions on evolution?  If your correspondent is a
creationist, I highly reccomend _Climbing Mount Improbable_ by Richard
Dawkins.

<a name="3598qlink2">Studying physics was a real eye-opener for me in high school.  All too
often, I find, people are prepared to say that things work outside the
physical laws as we know them.  While this isn't logically inconsistent,
only after I studied physics for a while did I come to get an idea of how
much physics explains; ie how much we'd have to throw away if we decided
to throw out physics.  Any metaphysical theory that attempts to explain
miracles had better explain at least as much as Newtonian mechanics can.</a>

<p>
As far as science goes, I was in raptures over Drexler's _Engines of
Creation_.  I bought a copy for my mother.  (She still hasn't read it,
unfortunately...)

<p>
The computer/mind paradigm was also very interesting and important in my
own development.  There are a variety of good books on this topic.  I'd
reccomend Godel, Escher, Bach but I don't think it would be all that
compelling unless one was already somewhat convinced of the computational
theory of mind in the first place.  To this end, I might instead reccomend
Steven Pinker's _How the Mind Works_.

<p>
Similarly, studying ethical philosophy was another turning point for me;
however, this subject is sufficiently broad as to consume all of the other
reading combined.  :)  Having taken excellent courses which dealt with the
question of ethics, I can only really advocate taking a good class with a
good teacher.

<p>
I may think of some more later.
