I was certainly not a big books reader when i was younger, but one of
the first i had read was : "A brief history of time". I was more fond of
general scientific magazines or things like that... Why not a
subscription to a good magazine ?

<p>
For a good SF book i know of and without hesitation : "The Broken God"
by David Zindell...this book provide interesting new views on science,
religion, world, and humans, and certainly inspire, without
being too specialized, or difficult ;)).
