<i>&gt; due to TrollTechs proprietary (despite available as source, you </i><br>

I have yet to see a Window Manager that does not use X for Linux.
However, there is a project to create one called Berlin
(www.debian.org/berlin)  Personally, I use a WM called Afterstep(loosely
based on FVWM2) with has a very stylish look reminiscent of NeXT.  I plan
to switch to WindowMaker soon, and then Berlin when it is usable.
Enlightenment looks great, but apparently it is slow on the average
machine.

<p>
I recommend Linux to anyone who is frustrated with Window's crashing.  I
have a dual-boot system... my Windows crashes daily, my Linux has not
crashed once since I installed it a year ago; however, I do not recommend
Linux for anyone that wants to be able to point and click to do
everything.  Linux is not quite there yet, but it will be within the next
couple years.

For some nice screeshots of what your Linux GUI could look like, check out
