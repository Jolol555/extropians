<p>
still, a jupiter brain is limited by his own definition of size... the
size of a jovian like planet...

<p>
there is also problems arising of the locality of a such big density...

<p>
what to do to add more capacity ? when all is optimized, you probably
have to add matter to make grow the jovian computer... but assuming what
i know and except some speculative theories of using neutron stars to
make computers with really high ultra efficient density, there will be
an alt when the density is too high.
<br>
to stop the growing process is too bad...

<p>
small upload have the benefits to provide the cornucopia of a
civilisation of minds, a jupiter brain with only one "identity" is
really alone. i think one of the joys of existence reside in
interractions between "peoples"

<p>
as far as i know, there is not enough matter available in our region of
the universe to make a such rich civilisation (by interaction between
differents entity)with jupiter brains only.

<p>
long distances are also a problems, with "liliputians", you could use
all the matter available, not neccessary with apparition of density
problems...

<p>
but my mind is not too clear about that now...
