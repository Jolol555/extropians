<a name="1013qlink1">After a rather disastrous surgical post recovery my doctor and I were
discussing the restrictions the state now has on doctors which intrudes into
the doctor/patient clinical decisions. 

<p>
He mentioned that Jesse "The Body" Ventura Reform party had many of the
libertarian ideas. There has been no news coverage on this in California.
The play on the election in Minnesota has been of the nature "how strange".
Which is interesting California is applying that term to another state. I
thought California had an exclusive on it :-)

<p>
Does anyone have any information on the Reform party and Jesse's election.
Was this a voter revolt against intrusive government.</a>

<p>
Thanks,
