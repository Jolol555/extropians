<p>
I haven't read or talked to _anyone_ who thinks that libertarianism is
"perfect" - and my readings on the subject are wide and copious. This is an
unsupported straw man. Nor do most consider it a "system" (see below).

<p>
<a href="1362.html#1610qlink5">&gt; I still think much less government would produce better results by almost</a><br>
any
<br>

<p>
I don't "believe in" libertarianism either - as if it were a religion or
some monolithic body of doctrine, or a specifiable "system". Libertarianism
is nothing more or less than an across-the-board commitment to individual
freedom, generally summed up as a desire to prohibit  physical coercion.
Ideologies abound, but ideology isn't the essence; libertarians differ
(sometimes bitterly) on just about everything except the fundamental
commitment to liberty. It's a movement, not an ideology.</a>

<p>
What moved me to engage the original poster a bit impatiently was my
weariness of the ignorant stereotypes parroted by those who rely on the
mass media for their "information", and obviously don't know any
libertarians personally: lack of compassion, insensitivity, money-grubbing,
hardheartedness, ad nauseum. How about making an honest attempt to learn
how libertarians actually think and feel?

<p>
Peace,
