I was more up on this back at university, but as I recall some U.S.
companies (a subsidiary of Nestle S.A. may have been among them) were
attempting to market baby formula in the Third World.  The problem was that
formula must be prepared with water, and many residents of underdeveloped
areas don't have access to clean water.  The end results was that mothers
were substituting this potentially tainted formula for their own perfectly
healthy breast milk.

<p>
Don't have a current source, however.

<p>
I also had a book called "Shopping for a Better World" which evaluated the
practices of many companies.  Unfortunately, so many of companies turned out
to be subsidiaries of megacorps like American Home Products and Beatrice
(what ever happened to Beatrice?) that the truly conscientious shopper was
left with little to buy.
