It's certainly true in many plant and animal species, but they usually
don't function as both male and female at the same time or are
physically incapable of self-fertilisation, so inbreeding is avoided.

<p>
As for people, I have heard of a hermaphrodite who 
had "perfect" complete male and female genitalia, however s/he was a
child who later had one set removed (don't know which).
