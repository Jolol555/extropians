I would phase this another way:  Either posthuman society will be maximally
complex, or it will be maximally simple.  If there are tradeoffs and checks
and balances, they will not be the ones we know.

<p>
Human perception is the perception of differences, and we are evolved to
compete in the areas where narrowly balanced forces give rise to differential
rates of reproduction.  This has given us a skewed and unrealistic view of the
Universe as balanced between competing agents, with force and resistance
always in the same order of magnitude; the unbalanced forces are not
"perceived", as discrete and changeable values, at all.

<p>
Life can only evolve in the areas free from overwhelming forces and positive
feedback - but balanced forces and negative feedback are really very fragile
things, which is why organic life doesn't evolve in the depths of space or the
heart of stars.  If you want to speculate about post-Singularity processes,
you have to abandon the basic human ontology.  That's what makes an "extreme" Singularitarian.

<p>
The Universe is extreme, but life can evolve only in the rare balances.
