Brian, you are correct that there have been a nuber of reports of this type
in the papers. However, the vast makority of them turn out to be hoaxes
perpetrated by kids. The follow-up stories don't make the front page.
The few actual cases constitute a nasty example of the harm an urban
legend can do: it's unlikely that these sickos would think this up on their own.

All of this information is on the same web site that I pointed to.
