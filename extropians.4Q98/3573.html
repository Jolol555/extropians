simulates the effect of undoing the freezing damage.</a>

It is interesting, but I question the assumption that uploading will
automatically imply the ability to re-engineer minds.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3596qlink9">Theoretically, uploading is a rather mechanical process: it is merely a
matter of simulating a particular physical system (the brain/body) at a
sufficient level of detail.  The technical difficulties are a matter of
sensing the object at that resolution, and having enough computer power
to run the simulation.  But perhaps these can be overcome.</a>

<p>
<a name="3596qlink10"><a name="3584qlink3">Re-engineering brains requires a wholly different level of understanding.</a>
Uploading is like painting a copy of a Rembrandt.  Re-engineering is
like being Rembrandt.  It is a creative action, not a mechanical one.</a>

<p>
<a name="3596qlink11">You would need detailed understanding of how the brain works in functional
terms.  You have to know what to tweak and how to tweak it.  You would
have to understand consciousness and how it is related to brain activity,
a matter which appears intractably difficult today.</a>

<p>
<a name="3596qlink12">True, having the ability to upload may help with our understanding of
these issues, by giving access to neural function at a fine level of
detail (and possibly allowing experimentation on uploads).  But I think
it is going to take a long time before we are able to re-engineer minds,
even once we have nanotech.
