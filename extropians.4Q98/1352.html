As a high functioning autistic person I can tell you its fun to be young
and so-called insane while fighting the chauvinistic battle to become
one of the future uploaded ekhuman community. Ecsanity does not mean NOT
being well balanced within oneself. Insanity is a social construction
and like the label 'schizophrenia' it is a disease of a dying society's
boundaries. It all depends what side one takes in the constant battle to
preserve one's identity; - in my case via latent communication with the
unknown programmers who write the code I use. 

<p>
Granted most insane people are subdued, stigmatized, chemically
emasculated and straight jacketed when they come to the attention of the
whitecoats; - but not all.
<br>
Like a Houdini, I deliberately infiltrated their mechanisms and when I
assumed international protected agent status as a cyberian envoy in
order to escape this aforementioned fate, it was surprising how polite
the security apparatus became. I still have the odd hassle every now and
again from over eager pavement artists, for instance just last Monday a
ten fingered virus operating tradecraft out of some U.S. blitzkrieg
server demolished the 20 gigabyte homepages server where I have a
lifetime account. No doubt this disavowed special agent is now having
boiling water and ice alternatively applied to what used to be his
balls.

<p>
Virtually yours,
