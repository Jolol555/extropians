 I was thinking the same thing some time ago, considering that it was
mainly an intra afghan problem that we are not allowed to judge. But in
fact there is far more to it, it seems a small ex CCCP country has some
oil that has to be taken somewhere, two choices, 1- through russia 2-
through afghanistan and pakistan toward the indian ocean.

<p>
  It seems that big oil companies (of which french and american ones I
expect) are pushing for control over an oleoduc that would cross afghan
and pakistan countries and willing to pay huge royalties for it. And
they are giving money to whoever can assure them the passage.

<p>
   In effect, talibans are strongly helped by pakistan -&gt; ie there are
pakistanise 'mercenaries' helping the talibans to gain control of
afghanistan.
