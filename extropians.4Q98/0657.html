<p>
Sure, and many Tobacco Institute studies say you can't get lung cancer from
smoking. The facts are that a) any Mac is more expensive than a comparable PC
(this may have changed recently, but I'm not sure), b) between 1980 and 1996
the typical office PC was 2/3 the cost of a comparable Apple, making it the
obvious economic choice of bean counters who didn't give a fiddlers damn about
ergonomics. c) Those office PCs were not capable of running other GUI OS's,
they were stuck with various flavors of DOS until the introduction of Windows.
If Apple had gone out and developed a Mac OS to work on PCs, then they might
have something to complain about with Windows, but if they had, I doubt Windows
would exist today.

<p>
The funny thing is that corporate types PREFER fast depreciation.

<i>&gt; &gt;some great products, their people are very good in what they are doing...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would have to disagree. Several of their products are good (Excel remains</i><br>
<i>&gt; an example of MS at its best), most are merely passable, and too many (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; amongst these some of the most widely used) are absolutely horrid. MS Word</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a horror, from both user and support viewpoints, for example. Almost any</i><br>
<i>&gt; other widely available commercial WP app is better - Nisus, WordPerfect,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Claris, et al. Faster, more stable, less cluttered, and more intuitive. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suspect that centuries of productivity hours have been poured down the</i><br>
<i>&gt; MSWord drain.</i><br>

<p>
WP which was first to market was technically superior to Word, thus it got an
early lead in word processing intensive fields like Secretarial/legal, etc. and
people that got trained in WP mindsets obviously have a fixed idea of how a
word processor should run. Word, on the other hand, started off as a simpler
application, so its learning curve was, in fact, shorter than WP. Today, it
really does not matter, though if a user starts with one word processor, they
will tend to have trouble migrating to another with the same efficiency as they
did with the original. This goes both ways. I, for example, find WP abominable
to use, but only because I spend years on Word.

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, as someone who uses a PC with no microsoft software at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; all, I don't think that he'd have much control. :)  With no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; intervention at all, I think that Windows will go the way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; MacOS (which has fewer users now than Linux, IIRC).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Untrue (YDNRC). According to recent Dataquest research, more than 22</i><br>
<i>&gt; million computers *currently* run MacOS (70% of a total sold base of over</i><br>
<i>&gt; 30 million since its introduction 1984, Macs may cost a bit more, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; apparently they are built to last as well). With roughly 3.2 users per</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer, that means that there are about 70 million Mac OS users</i><br>
<i>&gt; worldwide. Apple, btw, has increased its desktop mkt share over the last</i><br>
<i>&gt; year - an underreported story even in the face of that company's recent</i><br>
<i>&gt; triumphs in the marketplace.</i><br>

<p>
I would love to look at this study. Considering that most Macs are used in two
areas: publishing and college students, I would have to highly contest the
users per Mac figures as overly generous. I also contest the claim that 70% of
all Macs are currently being "used". I see many more unused/piling up dust Macs
today than I do ones in use, and the ones in use are almost all version 7.5 or
newer.

<a href="0623.html#0657qlink5">&gt; Linux installed base is increasing rapidly (and please note that I am one</a><br>
<i>&gt; of "those crazy Linux users"), but even the most optimistic (and somewhat</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-serving, it should be noted) estimates by Red Hat puts the installed</i><br>
<i>&gt; base of Linux users around 7.5 million. More realistic estimates put the</i><br>
<i>&gt; number between 250,000 - 1.5 million. [Harald T. Alvestrand has a Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt; counter project, some quite rational thoughts on the difficulties in</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting good numbers for this estimate, and links to various other attempts</i><br>
<i>&gt; to pin down an accurate estimate. <a href="http://counter.li.org/estimates.html">http://counter.li.org/estimates.html</a> ]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Also check out Quinn the Eskimo's *very cogent (and funny) essay on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Perils of the Installed User Base Argument"</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.quinn.echidna.id.au/Quinn/WWW/ideology/InstalledUserBase.html">http://www.quinn.echidna.id.au/Quinn/WWW/ideology/InstalledUserBase.html</a></i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; reason he got *that* much market share is A) marketing, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; B) usability.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, this is the point on which Justice disagrees, innit? They maintain</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and are attempting to show through evidence and testimony) that MS got and</i><br>
<i>&gt; held a lot of that mkt share through unethical and illegal anti-competitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; practices. Btw, for Max and others who seemed to have missed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinction, it is various *monopolistic* practices which are illegal, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually being a monopoly.</i><br>

<p>
While I prefer Netscape myself, I do concede one important technical advantage
that Internet Explorer has over Netscape, which would, if I were an AOL
executive would sell me on that browser as the default browser: page load time.
IE hands down loads a page faster than Netscape. AOL's major malfunction over
the past 8 years has been that bandwidth per user actually used is extremely
low. Page load speeds and mail delivery times, as well as connection
reliability are among the worst I have seen in any ISP or online service. This
may have changed recently, but at the time of the browser war Justice is
arguing, AOL was WAY behind on backbone expansion, and had picked up up
millions of new users.

<p>
Microsofts sales people may have been agressive, but no more so than I have
seen from many other sales people in other companies and industries. If I had
been an AOL exec at the time I would have picked IE myself....

<a href="0623.html#0657qlink6">&gt; &gt;(as a side note, linux is still quite tough to use and configure, count</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1-2 more years for it to really get into the general market)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think Linux has a great future as a server OS, but I am skeptical that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will *ever* reach the desktop in a way that makes a real impact on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other OSes. Nor is this neccessarily a bad thing - I don't want to drive a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 747 to the grocery, and I don't need a passenger car that can seat 300 and</i><br>
<i>&gt; can hit Mach 0.8.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But baby, I *love* having that 747 at my beck and call!</i><br>
