Abstract
<br>
  To characterize the pharmacological effects of
  N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) on life span, we administered PBN in
  drinking water to 24.5-month-old mice, and the survivors were counted. Their
  water consumption and body weights were measured as biological markers.
  PBN-treated animals as compared with control animals had prolonged mean and
  maximum life spans. Their water consumption decreased but no significant
  change was found in their body weights, indicating that the metabolism was
  improved. Results showed that PBN indeed affects physiological functions and
  extends life span. We propose that nitric oxide release from PBN may be
  involved in altering the aging process.
