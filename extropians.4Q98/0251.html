<a href="0246.html#0251qlink1">&gt; Transhuman Mailing List</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nick Bostrom suggested that he &amp; I take public our private </i><br>
<i>&gt; conversation about definitions of transhumanism.  I proposed:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0255qlink1"><i>&gt;    Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to change the world so much in the next century or two that </i><br>
<i>&gt;    our descendants will in many ways no longer be "human." </i><br>

<p>
The use of the word "descendants" is problematical.</a>

<p>
<a name="0255qlink2"><a href="0246.html#0251qlink2">&gt; This definition focuses on positive, not normative, beliefs. </a><br>

<p>
What does that mean -- positive beliefs?  How does the set "positive
beliefs" differ from the set "beliefs"?</a>

<p>
<a href="0246.html#0251qlink3">&gt; To those who think that a definition should focus on normative</a><br>
<i>&gt; beliefs I ask:  Why do there seem to be so few people who share</i><br>
<i>&gt; our positive beliefs but not our normative beliefs?  That is, </i><br>
<i>&gt; where are the people who believe that big technology-induced</i><br>
<i>&gt; change is coming, and think that is a terrible thing?  </i><br>

<p>
People believe what they want<a name="0255qlink3"> to.  I know lots of people who believe that
a big technology-induced change is coming, and that technology is a
</a>
terrible thing.  They /all/ believe that civilization will collapse,
or in some way change to bring things more in line with /their/ desires.
It is a very similar mindset, I think, to the Christian who thinks the world
is corrupt and full of sin, and headed for an apocalypse in which it will
get what it deserves.  I think it is an expression of sublimated feelings of
powerlessness and indignation.

<p>
Transhumanists believe things will change to conform to /their/ desires.
Maybe this is also an expression of some sublimated feelings.

<p>
<a name="0255qlink4"><a href="0246.html#0251qlink4">&gt; 3) When thinking about the future, most people succumb to wishful</a><br>
<i>&gt;    thinking, and so choose positive beliefs based on normative ones.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    So those who think big techno-driven change is OK are willing </i><br>
<i>&gt;    to think it will happen.  And those who think such change is bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;    believe that it isn't likely.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, that's what I mean.</a>
