Unfortunately that won't work.<a name="0424qlink1"> I can instantly change the state of your
receiver 1000 light years away but I can't send you a message. The
message is "encoded" and until you get the equivalent of a one time pad
it looks random to you. I can't send you the one time pad ahead of time
because I don't know what it will be, I only find out when I actually send the
particular message and quantum process create one, so now the only way
I have to get the one time pad to you is by old fashioned radio.  1000 years from
now when you receive the one time pad you can confirm that I have instantly
changed one apparently random state of you receiver into another apparently
random state. They weren't really random of course but they would look that
way to you until you got the pad.</a>
