One prudential motive for adopting the views typically favoured in Europe,
Oz, etc (and of course large sections of the USA) is caught quite aptly by
Max M:

<p>
I find all this entirely plausible.  Solutions based on such insights are
hard to find, of course.  Old-style socialism didn't do it, authoritarian
social democracies have made some shameful blunders (such as routinely
taking kids away from `bad' parents) and current-style capitalism (applied
in countries that are internally fragmented on grounds in sectional or race
fears &amp; hatreds) has some horrible running sores of its own.

<p>
The sorts of absurd strawmen that get lugged out in these discussions - `If
you steal all Gates's money and share it equally, we'll have a big party
for a day and a half and then society will crash and burn' - is so
unrelated to the kinds of real, urgent issues described above that I am
embarrassed to see people utter them.
