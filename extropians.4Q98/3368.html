Tim Bates, &lt;tbates@karri.bhs.mq.edu.au&gt;, writes, regarding software
patents:
<br>
<a href="3359.html#3368qlink1">&gt; There should be no software patents whatsoever. I argue that there is </a><br>
<i>&gt; nothing in software which is not obvious, it is all "obvious". </i><br>
<i>&gt; No patents = no living with bad decisions. Why the heck do you trust the </i><br>
<i>&gt; government, government clerks at that,  to know what is best for you? </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3375qlink1">Well, as you say, the definition of "obvious" may not be clear.  But
I would not agree that everything in software or other disciplines
is "obvious".</a>  To say that you must broaden the word so much that it
is useless.

<p>
There are extremely intricate algorithms and other inventions which
are far from obvious.<a name="3375qlink2">  Some inventors are motivated primarily by the
hope of patent protection.  Without patents, these people might have
gone into some other field.</a>

<p>
<a name="3398qlink1"><a name="3385qlink1"><a name="3375qlink3">In cryptography, the researcher sometimes called the "patron saint"
of cypherpunks, David Chaum, has a number of patents on technologies
which can greatly enhance freedom and privacy.</a>  It appears that the
hope of patent protection has been a significant motivation for him.
This is what you risk losing if you eliminate patents.
</a>
</a>

<p>
Chaum is a single individual.<a name="3375qlink4">  Big companies like IBM have expensive
research labs that are de facto "patent factories".  They crank out
thousands of patentable inventions every year.</a>  This intellectual property
<a name="3375qlink5">helps the company justify the research expense by giving them something
they can add to the bottom line.</a>  Without patents, the economics of
<a name="3375qlink6">industrial research would be less favorable, and there would probably
be less</a> of it.

<p>
<a href="3359.html#3368qlink2">&gt; Hal, this last comment you make below, is, I think, highly instructive:</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Don't forget, though, that patents only last for 20 years, while copyright</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;can go on for 100.  Many of the controversial software patents will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be expiring in the next few years.  In my own field, cryptography,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the patent on public key technology expired last year, and the patent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on the RSA algorithm expires in September of 2000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; How do you defend patent expiry if it is a right?  To me, if patents are </i><br>
<i>&gt; justified, they should last forever. Just like when you buy some land, it </i><br>
<i>&gt; is not yours for 50 years. It is yours, period. The fact neither of us </i><br>
<i>&gt; thinks that patents should last in perpetuity suggests that patents are </i><br>
<i>&gt; property but are rather a state tool arrived at by trading off the </i><br>
<i>&gt; interests of one power group against another. The losers are you, me, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; innovative companies.</i><br>

<p>
As I indicated in an earlier posting on intellectual property, I don't
see property in such absolute terms.<a name="3375qlink7">  If society wants to define a kind
<a name="3407qlink1">of property that lasts only a finite amount of time, there is nothing
inherently contradictory</a> in that.  We already have other kinds of economic
</a>
<a name="3407qlink2">relationships with limited lifespans, like leases and loans.  There is
<a name="3375qlink8">nothing wrong with extending this notion to property, if the participants
agree that they are benefitted by it.
</a>
