<p>
Acting to satisfy one's perceived desires could practically be a
definition for simply being alive.  Every creature does this.  So,
of course it's a *part* of human nature.  That's not saying much,
though.  IMO, examining human nature is about identifying those
human attributes favored by natural selection and "hard-wired"
into our neural systems.  It's the difference between those needs
which we are predisposed to experience (trans-culturally) and
those which we learn.

Sorry, but not really.

<p>
Once again, I'm not against privacy.  I'm just curious about it's
genesis and its role in human development, and I'm having difficulty
understanding the logic of your statement.  Think of other words
that could be inserted into this similar statement:

<pre>
                Since lots of people like ___________ (for *whatever*
           reason!), forcing them to give it up is contrary to human nature.

</pre>
<p>
How about:

<p>
rape
<br>
murder
<br>
discrimination
<br>
ignorance
<br>
drunk driving
<br>
bigotry
<br>
child abuse

<p>
Maybe this is too much.  Sorry.  I get carried away.
All I was trying to say was that IMHO a need for privacy
is most likely tied to cultural factors, not neural ones.

<p>
Just a little more . . .

Interesting.  Is this from David Buss' book, "The Evolution of Desire"?
Does it imply that women have a greater need for privacy than men?
Or are you saying that there are scores of reasons why both sexes
have a *need* for privacy?  If so, are most of these reasons pro-social,
anti-social, or asocial?

<p>
Like Max, I'm not a very private person.  In fact I'm quite a
self-discloser.
