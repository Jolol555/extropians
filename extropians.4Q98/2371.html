<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;If a society cannot trust the individual, how can it trust a group of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;individuals? I can always trust myself to look out for me, and you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; trust</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;yourself to look out for you. I cannot always trust you to look out for</i><br>
me,
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink2">&gt;&gt; &gt;especially when our interests are in conflict. Applying this principle</a><br>
to
<br>
<a href="2273.html#2371qlink3">&gt;&gt; one</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;thing and not another is hypcritical. Applying it to technology, or to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;social/cultural issues, but not to economic relationships reflects a</i><br>
lack
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of</i><br>
<a href="2348.html#2371qlink4">&gt;&gt; &gt;integrity which I find disturbing, and untrustworthy.</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Because, like most ideals,  the system breaks down under certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Take, as an example, garbage collection.  Everyone has garbage.  None of</i><br>
us
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink5">&gt;&gt; want it cluttering up our kitchens.  We coul set things up so that each</a><br>
of
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink6">&gt;&gt; us pays a small fee to have out rubbish picked up.  but some people will</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; decline to pay.  Now their rubbish is affecting me.  Should I pay for</i><br>
their
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink7">&gt;&gt; rubbish to be removed?  Or should we force them to pay gfor their rubbish</a><br>
to
<br>
<a href="2348.html#2371qlink8">&gt;&gt; be removed?  Or just have their steaming piles of decomposing filth</a><br>
collect
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink9">&gt;&gt; in the middle of the street?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, in an anarchical situation, they have the choice of getting their</i><br>
trash
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink10">&gt;taken away or having me bazooka their front yard. In a libertarian</a><br>
situation,
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink11">&gt;they have the choice of taking it away or paying the impact their</a><br>
slovenliness
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink12">&gt;has on my property value, as well as my increased costs for vermin control</a><br>
and
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink13">&gt;possible health impacts once I've complained to my PPA, which contacts</a><br>
their
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink14">&gt;PPA, which imposes a higher premium on them for the increased risk they are</a><br>
<i>&gt;assuming, which would likely equal or exceed the weekly fee for trash</i><br>
<i>&gt;removal.... funny how that can work out.</i><br>


<p>
PPA?  And in one of these cases you yourself are coercing them.  In another
</a>
case you have a system of government (I assume that's what the PPA is).  How
is either of these an improvement?

<p>
<a name="2384qlink2"><a href="2348.html#2371qlink15">&gt;&gt; Another example: Neonatology - medicine as applied to babies.</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A baby is born with a defect.  the baby is a person.  It has no income</i><br>
and
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink16">&gt;&gt; no resources.  Should it's parents be forced to pay for it, even if they</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; can't, even if they don't want to?  Should it be asked for a credit card</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; number when it's born?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The parents would of course have coverage under their private health</i><br>
insurance.
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink17">&gt;Parents who cannot afford to bear or keep a child should not keep the</a><br>
child. A
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink18">&gt;poor person's PPA could easily set a high premium for the person if they</a><br>
are
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink19">&gt;fertile, and low if they agree to a contraceptive implant for a long term.</a><br>
Its
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink20">&gt;all about making people take responsibility for their actions, and paying</a><br>
for
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink21">&gt;them. If they cannot afford them then they learn quickly enough about</a><br>
personal
<br>
<i>&gt;responsibility.</i><br>


<p>
So you're still forcing them to pay a tax.  Just to either a PPA or health
insurance.  And then you're telling them whether tey're 'allowed' to have</a> a
child.  Still sounds like government.

<a name="2384qlink3"><a href="2329.html#2371qlink22">&gt;&gt; Just two problems that pure libertarian capitalism has problems with.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hardly, since pure libertarian capitalism has not and does not exist to</i><br>
date,
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink23">&gt;you don't know do you?</a><br>


<p>
Both situations were obviously theoretical, as libertarian capitalism is
theoretical.  I do know this.  I have studied some history (and politics and
socioloigy and business and philosophy and physics and the occasional other
</a>
thing here and there).


<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2384qlink4"><a href="2329.html#2371qlink24">&gt;&gt; I agree that Libertarian Capitalism works in 90% of all cases and that it</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; should eb left to do so as much as is physically possible.  But no system</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; works 100% of the time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sure it can. The solar system has been working fine for billions of years.</i><br>
The
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink25">&gt;fun thing about libertarianism is that it allows the market to create</a><br>
solutions
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink26">&gt;for ANY problem. It prices those solutions at their TRUE value, so nobody</a><br>
has to
<br>
<a href="2329.html#2371qlink27">&gt;pay for something they don't want to, and well meaning busy bodies cant ram</a><br>
<i>&gt;anything down anybody's throat.</i><br>


</a>
<p>
The solar system doesn't 'work'.  It just happens.  Value is entirely
<a name="2384qlink5">dependent on viewpoint and tends to come out at the average of what people
are willing to pay - which tends to leave out those people who fall far
enough below the average income.
