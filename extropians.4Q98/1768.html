<br>
You respond:
<br>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink1">&gt;&gt; The flaw lies in the fact that I just re-read "the extropian</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Principals v2.6, and there is no non-aggression principal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "have some fire Strawman"</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink2">&gt;Now you're really burning me up. :-)</a><br>

<p>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink3">&gt;Obviously I wasn't referring to the Extropian Principles, but to</a><br>
<i>&gt;the general libertarian prohibition of aggression. Extropians, by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the coiner's own definition, are "libertarian transhumanists", so</i><br>
<i>&gt;there's more to what we hold in common than the EPs, no?</a></i><br>

<p>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink4">&gt;So douse that torch already.</a><br>

<p>
The torch was strictly rhetorical, (and a wizard of oz ref)
ToughLaw Inc (PPL) takes arson seriously.


<p>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink5">&gt;I suspect (and hope) that your death provision would be found null</a><br>
<i>&gt;and void by most freemarket courts. There are things that can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;legitimately be contracted for, including, especially, harmful</i><br>
<i>&gt;effects on nonsignatory parties. (Right, Greg?)</i><br>

<p>
Greg did a great job on this part.(Thanks Greg)

<p>
You made another attempt to differentiate punishment from revenge:

<p>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink6">&gt;&gt; I argue it is fair because it is the only thing a murderer has</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of equivalent value to what he/she took.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink7">&gt;What good does it do the corpse? How is it fair to forfeit yet</a><br>
<i>&gt;another life, to nobody's benefit? What does it do to compensate</i><br>
<i>&gt;for what was lost? IOW, exactly where is the justice?</i><br>

<p>
As I argued to Paul, since the victim is dead they cannot act in
their own interest, so the society must. The murderer has forfeit
his/her life in the act of taking another. The murderer does not
get to enjoy living, nor can they spread their genes/memes. The
ultimate price for the ultimate despicable act.

<p>
<a href="1718.html#1768qlink8">&gt; If an individual does it it is revenge.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="1725.html#1768qlink9">&gt;...implying that a wrong, so long as it's perpetrated by some</a><br>
<i>&gt;_non-unit_number of individuals, somehow magically becomes right.</i><br>
<i>&gt;How?</i><br>

<p>
By the definition between revenge and punishment posted earlier.

<p>
We seem to have exhausted the usefullness of this thread.
