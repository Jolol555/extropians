<p>
Not all mammal embryos can be cryopreserved 'as is' (pig embryos require a
protocol which causes a temporary breakdown of the cytoskeleton), human
are one of the hardy ones. IIRC, the embryos are frozen at a few cell
stage, where the embryo is microscopically small (and so subthreshold to
certain damage mechanisms) and the cells are still undifferentiated. At
this stage a considerable fraction of the cells can die, the remaining
ones still being able to compensate. Even so, a fair fraction of
cryopreserved embryos is nonviable. 

<p>
If you freeze a macroscopic adult organ (say, a human brain) the amount of
damage caused by currently utilized protocols which are perfectly okay for
embryos is unacceptable, probably even if we consider structural
conservation as the only criterion. Certain organs (brain, liver) are many
times more fragile than others (heart, kidney).

<p>
Much research is still needed to classify the kind and quantify the amount
of damage occuring, so that better protocols can be devised. Basically the
only accepted validation criterion of cryopreservation protocols is tissue
viability, which makes it doubly difficult (you subject the tissue/organ
to additional damage during thawing/devitrification, and viability can be
difficult to measure).
