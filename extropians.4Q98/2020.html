Well, nanotechnology is an absolute prerequisite.   I need it for the facilitation of creating whatever
I want and recycling it, rendering moot the need for cargo space.   Existence of nanotechnology portends
the potential for uploading, therefore increasing tremendously the possible spaces of ones perceived
environment.  I could just as easily make the interstellar journey experiencing a tropical beach as any
other radical imaginary virtual space.   Besides, I don't plan on being alone, but instead look forward
to as many other like-minded individuals coming along as possible.  Finally, assuming Elizier and Vinge
are correct about the time we reach a Singularity, I'll either be dead or fast on my way to inventing or
playing with some kind of FTL drive or traversible wormhole technology, rendering long-duration space
flights irrelevant as well.
