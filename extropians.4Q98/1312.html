<p>
After thinking about HDTV 16:9 display aspect ratio and 
next-generation flat panel computer monitors and digital displays, 
I've decided that my vote is for 2:1 aspect ratio.

<p>
This makes a for room for on-screen icon controls that do not 
obstruct the view of the content, and allows for hypertext annotation 
to movies that be displayed while the movie is running.

<p>
Since the whole object is to engage the viewer into contributing to 
the body of knowledge, particularly in the context of web-based 
streaming HDTV, the "blank space" on the side of the letterbox can 
become the "CRIT" space, where the fine-grained annotations can be 
indicated.

<p>
For average consumers, the space can be left blank, or used to 
display a vertical column of smaller square Picture-In-Picture iconic 
representations of live video feeds from other sources.

<p>
Since this is totally programmable, the iconic representations of 
annotions can be psychologically color coded so that they are almost 
unnoticable, and not a distraction; or the options could be set so 
that they are literal bells and whistles designed to pull you into 
discussion forums and video conferences related to those scenes.

<p>
Also, 2:1 is a very natural binary compliment, which will result in 
the most efficient use of the computer memory.

<p>
We can tell our successors in future generations, when they are 
watching the old movies shot on 35mm film, that in the old days 
before digital movie making, we used 16:9.  They'll probably comment 
that the movies don't look wide enough!

<p>
By encouraging hyperlinking and annotation by providing a little 
extra space, say off to the left of the 16:9 movie frame, it will be 
easier to construct a "visual dictionary", with inputs from all 
elements of society, thus encouraging interactivity, critical 
thinking, and social integration and diversity.

<p>
I don't think that modifying factory production from 4:3 to 2:1 
aspect ratios will be that costly, and the same flat display devices 
will then be able to serve both the computing and entertainment 
industries simultaneously.

<p>

<p>
These displays are being produced and sold for computers for an 
end-user price of under $900.  It should not be too difficult to 
change the PC standard monitors to a 2:1 version of this item.  By 
shifting production from this model, to one that is larger (say 
2048x1024), the same item can be marketed to computer users and home 
entertainment users.  Perhaps at a starting mass production size of 
456.2mm (W) x 228.1mm (H) (18.0" x 9.0") (maybe a street price of 
$999 or thereabouts, to get things moving)?
