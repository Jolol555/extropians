<a href="3235.html#3335qlink1">&gt;I think it is believed that fugu intestine sushi is a uniquely </a><br>
<i>&gt;pleasant way to take a permanent vacation from this world, that </i><br>
<i>&gt;indeed the tetrodotoxin traces present in the rest of the fish </i><br>
<i>&gt;tissue is an addictive drug lending a particular kick to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;traditional Nipponese delicacy. The permanent psychic break as </i><br>
<i>&gt;aftermath of the zombification process you described may well </i><br>
<i>&gt;be at least partly attributable to simple brain damage: pulse </i><br>
<i>&gt;and aspiration shallow enough to fool the coroner/M.D. and a </i><br>
<i>&gt;few hours spent in the confines of a coffin prior to excavation </i><br>
<i>&gt;by the priest should result to ischaemic damage of primarily </i><br>
<i>&gt;higher cortex functions, probably wiping out a lot of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;personality of the convict, possibly also making the zombie a </i><br>
<i>&gt;good deal more docile. Maybe the drug administred is </i><br>
<i>&gt;multicomponent, and includes neuroprotectants as well? </i><br>
<i>&gt;Certain people would be sure interested...</i><br>

I sampled Fugu when I lived in Japan, it's effects (tingling in the
fingertips, and lips) were amusing. Far more dangerous are the
chiri eaters, Chiri is made with various internal organs as well.
Japan lost Bando, one of their living treasures to Chiri.
Extropians may wish to note the emperor is forbidden to enjoy
either of these delicacies.

<a href="3235.html#3335qlink2">&gt;I also seem to (dimly) remember an African practice of dosing</a><br>
<i>&gt;unsuspecting husbands meals with a plant poison (calabaro bean?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;resulting in permanent lossage of memory (like a Korsakoff</i><br>
<i>&gt;patient?), but I forgot all the details. Hmm, let me try to</i><br>
<i>&gt;recollect what I was going to say...&lt;snip&gt;, &lt;snip&gt;.. it's gone...</i><br>
<i>&gt;huh... what...?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, the "Zombie Food" they are fed after contains one of these
substances.

I was very polite to everyone when I visited Haiti.

<p>
Yikes!!
