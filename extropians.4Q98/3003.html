<i>&gt; I disagree that people in groups such as corporations act</i><br>

<a name="3072qlink1"><i>&gt; money.  Through your own statement, you have concluded</a> that government</i><br>
<a name="3072qlink2"><i>&gt; is bad.  The corporations are given power by the government, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the corporations make money.  The government wants money</a> for nothing. </i><br>
<a name="3072qlink3"><i>&gt; Government allows certain corporations to flourish so that those in</i><br>

<i>&gt; Without government (or at least as we know it today), those</i><br>

<a name="3072qlink4"><i>&gt; said they could use would have to compensate you, if you desired,</a> for</i><br>
<a name="3072qlink5"><i>&gt; you to move.  Today there is no check on government and that is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem.  It is not the corporations who are seizing business</i><br>

<p>
Wrong yet again.  Have you ever heard the phrase "corporate 
welfare"?  It's other meaning is "double citizen taxation."</a>  Of course, 
<a name="3072qlink6">when taxes ARE assessed corporations, they just raise their prices, 
and the citizenry pay that way.  Either way, mouth or ass, it's the 
citizen getting shafted and the corporation getting off scot-</a>free (and,

<a name="3072qlink7">actually, on the other end of the shaft)!</a>                       Joe
