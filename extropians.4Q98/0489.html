<a name="0493qlink1"> As someone who routinely subjects various and sundry people to  highly
focused and intense electromagnetic energies during the course of  his day
to day activities, I have to take exception to this thread. While</a> it is true
</a>
<a name="0493qlink2">that given sufficient RF input  individuals can
and do percieve direct stimulation to their nervous system ( visual
sensations, peripheral nerves firing-muscle twitching), it seems highly
unlikely that an unmodified brain (  one with no little glass electrodes
imbedded in strategic areas ) could be stimulated in any sort of meaningful
way. The best focusing that is achieveable in my admittedly non-</a>universal
<a name="0493qlink3">experience is about 1mm. That is quite good enough for some outstanding
diagnostic images ( yes, I'm talking about Magnetic Resonance Imaging</a> ),
<a name="0493qlink4">that still means that you are stimulating a great many neurons and even that
much focusing requires the recipient to be in a rapidly changing magnetic
field of cosmic intensity. For those of you who have not had the (pleasure
?) of an MRI brain scan, I'll tell you what it feels like. IT'S LOUD!!! The
rapid alteration in the field gradients that allow image</a> production
<a name="0493qlink5">(focusing) produce sounds that are roughly equivalent to being right in
front of the speaker at a rock concert. It's certainly not something you
would be unaware</a> of.
