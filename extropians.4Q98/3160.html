I think he was directing the "fuck 'em" at those who insist on being able
to live at his unwilling expense. I second it.

<p>
<a href="3148.html#3160qlink4">&gt;I don't equate them, but I do think there is a strong correlation.</a><br>

<p>
Depends what you mean. To me, "emotional" does not mean "emotion-driven" or
"irrational", though I should have realized that that was your intended
meaning. What I meant was that we are emotional animals, but we don't have
to let our emotions swamp our rationality.

<i>&gt;Sounds like *you* don't think emotions and rational thought are entirely</i><br>

<p>
See above. My complaint about people "feeling" instead of "thinking" was a
shorthand way of saying that I wish people would stop *substituting* their
feelings for thought. I didn't really mean we should actually feel less.
Sorry for the confusion.

<p>
<a href="3148.html#3160qlink6">&gt;&gt;Anarchy is not a "system". It's simply freedom for systems to arise</a><br>
without
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;force of arms.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3148.html#3160qlink7">&gt;It's really a matter of semantics.</a><br>

<p>
No, it's matter of logical analysis. A condition or state of affairs need
not be a "system". Perhaps you think I'm splitting hairs, but I've seen
that thinking of anarchy as "a system" quickly leads to all sorts of
invalid conclusions about it. Anarchists, it's true, have systems of belief
about it, and also ideas about possible systems that may arise in a state
of anarchy, of course. But as I said, anarchy itself is simply the
condition of (maximal) freedom; or to use the dictionary definition, the
absence of civil "government".

<p>
As you yourself sagely observed, we can't predict the exact system or
systems that will arise in a spontaneous order.

<a href="3148.html#3160qlink8">&gt;[W]hat will really win them over is when they see how much happier and</a><br>

<i>&gt;which capitalism gained so many adherents?</i><br>

<p>
Yep - to the extent that capitalism (market freedom) has been allowed to
exist, anyway.

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Perhaps, but it's [dis]ingenuous to imply that the case for freedom</i><br>
reduces to a
<br>
<a href="3148.html#3160qlink9">&gt;&gt;mere concern for material success.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3199qlink2"><a href="3148.html#3160qlink10">&gt;I don't mean to imply this.  However, I also don't think the Japanese,</a><br>
e.g.,

<p>
<a name="3214qlink2">Insofar as they value *imposing* "social duties" on anyone,</a> I think they're
dead wrong.</a>

<p>
<a name="3199qlink3">By the way, referring to individual "gratification" was a subtle poisoning
of the well that I can't let slip by. Freedom has to do with control over
one's own life and property, not with (presumably sybaritic)

<p>
<a name="3201qlink2"><a name="3199qlink4"><a href="3148.html#3160qlink12">&gt;There are (or once were) many American "patriots" who would gladly lay</a><br>

<p>
Of course, to the extent they gladly (read willingly) laid down their
lives, I agree they weren't coerced. What's this have to do with the topic
at hand?</a></a>

<p>
Thanks, you've made it clear now, and I respect your standpoint. No more
guilt trips, I promise.

<p>
I think you're deluded, though, in thinking that force is required to keep
the economy functioning. I think it has the opposite effect. May I suggest
you check out (I believe) the second volume of Rothbard's _Man, Economy and
State_ at your leisure?
