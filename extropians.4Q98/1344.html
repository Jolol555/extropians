Thats interesting that you should emphasize that you are very *very* J.  I have noticed that form your past posts,  you have a tendecy to 'judge' other peoples posts before really 'observing' what it is they are trying to convey.  A most annoying trait. I too am an INTJ, howevever I am also a borderline INTP.  The J part of my personality is useful in making judgement once I have observed things adequately.  Like you, I also have a tendecy to judge before observing.  Certianly not something I'm willing to brag about like youself.

I'm with Kathryn Aegis in thinking all types are potentially susceptiple to Transhumanist ideas.

<p>
I would expect a true *trans* humanist to be an XXXX - that is above and transformable into any personality as it suits them.  Afterall, aren't we trying to transcend the limits of our psychology?  :-)
