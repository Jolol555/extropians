        Yes, I have enjoyed Rush's music for many years...particularly
their mid-'70's albums such as _2112_, _A Farewell To Kings_, and
_Hemispheres_.  Both the music and the lyrics to these albums are of high
quality.  The drummer\lyricist, Neal Peart, is a self-proclaimed
objectivist and has often combined his Randian inspiration with science
fiction concepts.  Other music which has inspired me is (as mentioned
previously) Mike Oldfield's _The Songs Of Distant Earth_, as well as
_Incantations_ and _Tubular Bells III_.  Also, artists like Terje Rypdal,
Mahavishnu Orchestra, David Torn and Peter Hammill all strive to break out
of musical preconceptions.  All of them have three things in common:
passion, focus and ability.  Again, these are just a few of *my* tastes in
music, and may not appeal to the majority of the list, yet they do have
qualities which most transhumanists can appreciate.
