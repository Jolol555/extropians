In a message dated 98-10-25 19:40:40 EST, you write:

<p>
Indeed.  Further, without a cure for cancer, there's no immortality.  
Cancer incidence goes up with about the 5th power of age and 
would strike virtually everybody down by 100-150 years if we
remained youthful.  Old people have lower cancer death rates 
than a direct extrapolation of the rate as their cancers tend to be old 
and feeble too.

<i>&gt; current research programs are enough to deliver significant benefits within</i><br>

<i>&gt; count on it.  </i><br>

<p>
Immortality, no.  But significant benefits are possible.  The lab I'm working
in doubled the life of fruit flies with 100 generations of breeding.  All that
happened was the the frequencies of genes at about 100 loci changed.
Basically each locus (gene) is probably reasonably independent of each other.
A normal fly might average, say, 10 "good"  genes. Even a long-lived normal 
fly will only have a couple extra "good" genes.  By breeding each fly has 
good genes at most of the loci, so the average bred fly outlives the 
longest-lived normal fly.

<p>
Presumably a similar situation applies to human.  I've got a couple good
aging genes, you've got a different set, etc.  If we can identify them and
alter each of our biochemistries (probably with drugs) to just mimic the
best known in each category we could get a couple extra decades.  An
example would be the rare HDL locus in a few Italian families which 
provides near-immunity to heart disease.

<p>
All I'm saying is that significant benefits (although not immortality) is 
*possible*.  We may not be looking at the right things.  Most human
research is on blood lipoprotein genes, rarish cancer genes, and
telomerase, while the most significant effects found yet, in nematodes
and yeast, are with insulin-related genes.  Even if we find something
 we may not be able to use it (particularly with genes that affect cancer).
