This is really more formal a name than I wish.

<p>
The "Southeast Cryonics Conference" conveys more formality than what I have
in 
<br>
mind. But I would like would like to meet with people in Florida and Georgia, 
etc., who share my interest in cryonics and technology.

<p>
How about Southeast Cryonics "Gathering"?

<p>
I have been thinking that perhaps an ORLANDO, FL based meeting, on a Friday 
night and Saturday day. 

<p>
This could be a fun and educational time, and be a good excuse to visit 
Orlando, which is one of the great recreational centers of the world.
I have e-mailed directly some folks obtained from the ALCOR membership 
handbook, and I am making this post on CRYONET.

<p>
One of the things I would like to accomplish at this meeting is to move 
forward on my "LIFEPACT" relationships. Another is to make the recommended 
video tape identifying what circumstances you wish re: possible reanimation. 
I do not currently own a video camera...perhaps someone out there coming to 
the gathering may such a high tech device. :)

<p>
I remain excited about the possibilities of extended life. I am hoping that 
freezing will be unnecessary, and that life extending and enhancing 
technologies will come online at reasonable and obtainable costs.

<p>
Perhaps a "bigwig" in cryonics/life extension may be interested in attending. 
Someone like Max More, Tom Donaldson, Brian Shock, Bob Ettinger, Saul Kent, 
Fred or Linda Chamberlain, Steve Bridge, etc., would be a welcome "Draw" and 
could "headline" the gathering. 

<p>
I was on the Extropian BB, and no longer am due to time restrictions. But if 
someone can forward this post or provide the email address, I would
appreciate 
<br>
this.

<p>
DATE: How does December 11 and 12 sound? This is a Friday and Saturday. 
LOCATION: The Orlando Hilton. this is a good facility with breakout rooms, 
gathering places, and reasonable room rates. I just returned from a Star Trek 
Convention there this last weekend. Room rate was only $65 plus tax, (this 
may have been a special...there were perhaps 500 in attendance. We could hope 
for a fraction of this number). 

<p>
(PS...I now know why ALCOR quit recruiting at sci-fi conventions...these fun- 
loving airheads have a different orientation than the science/ computer 
oriented demographic that typifies the cryonics prospect.)

<p>
AGENDA: To Be Announced. I will develop an agenda based on responses 
received to this posting. While not knowledgeable enough to "headline" this 
gathering, I *will* commit to being the organizer and promulgator. 
Is there any interest in this GATHERING? 

<p>
I will proceed only with some positive feedback from people who think this is 
a good idea. If there is only a few of us it could still be worthwhile.
