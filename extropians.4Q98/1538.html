When I was a 7th grade teacher in South Texas several years ago, I
introduced the cryonics idea though reading/writing exercises.
There were a few kids who thought they might go for the idea (maybe
5%).

Perhaps if an idea like the inevitability of death, and even that
under many circumstances, death is right, runs around in the human
brain for a long time, it becomes indelible. And so therefore the hard
road that cryonics and tranhumanism must face.
