<a name="3622qlink1">I get a bit irritated at times with this increasingly "kindergarten society"
where one's tiny steps are regulated, and want to suggest a little idea
that may be implemented some day as a movie or a cartoon.</a>
Suppose we have a traditional Western film with proud cowboys,
Indians, gold seekers and such (Americans still believe they carry
forward the ideas of liberty these people started).
And then, there will be all kinds of things that are currently accepted
as good and useful and socially necessary, set up in that environment.

<p>
So we'll have fines for riding horses without a helmet, regulated traffic,
sensitive gay cowboys, men watching kids while their wives go to the
women's empowering meetings,  saloon bouncers carding everybody
who looks under 30, half of law enforcement busy spying over what stuff
people smoke and throwing them in jail for 10 years if it's the wrong stuff,
people sitting at the side of the town doing nothing complaining that the
society didn't motivate them enough to learn to do anything, so sheriff
now has to take money away from hard workers and hand it over to the
lazybones, immigration authorities that may allow you to come into the
country only 8 years after you got a certified invitation from your first-degree
relative, burglars suing people for injuries they incurred while breaking into
their unsafe house, etc., etc.  I am sure one can come up with lots of
interesting contrasts here.

<p>
<a name="3588qlink1">Some of that may strangely fit, some may seem funny, some grotesque
and ridiculous.  In any case it can be a fun movie that could invite people
to think to what degree their current laws actually correspond to those
great traditional values.

<p>
Or maybe it has already been done?</a>
