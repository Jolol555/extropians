<a name="2655qlink1">Ok, you support the existence of government.  But do you support 
the
<br>
existence of a coercive (violence, theft toward the individual)
government?  If so, how do you support those views in terms of
Extropianism.  If not, please explain how a non-coercive government
could exist...

<p>
<a name="2755qlink1">An entirely non-coercive government cannot exist;</a> such an absolute 
is an abstract, unreifiable construct, resembling a "straw saint" (an 
<br>
"if we can't have perfection, let's not have anything" kind of <br>
argument).<a name="2755qlink2">  But since there are necessary, essential and 
indispensable services which only some form of government can 
</a>provide, it is useful for us to keep total non-coercion before us as an 
asymptotically approachable goal, towards which we strive by 
working to make the government we must have as non-coercive as 
possible, while still able to perform its necessary, essential and 
indispensable functions for us.  If this violates some obscure tenet</a> of 
Extropian dogma, then there's something wrong with Extropianism at 
that point, for the very concept of dogma is itself a coercive, 
intellectual freedom-stealing one (even antigovernment dogma).
