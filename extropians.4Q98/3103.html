roderick, i fear folks took my post far more seriously than i
had intended it.  {8^D i liked certain aspects of my visit to the
northeast.  even people who live in the middle of a big city
will likely buy their computer stuff from an online mail order
place, and books too, from amazon.  we have plenty of malls
and big generic shops around here, but very seldom do i
visit one of them.

<p>
it might seem like i am a born city type, but i grew up in
a dippy little town in florida and couldnt wait to run away
from home.  i like it much better here.

<p>
this little box that you and i are now sitting in front of has
opened the world to all of us.  we can live in outter
scumbucket wyoming if we want, and still learn about
technology, converse with anyone in the world, let
our brains grow instead of atrophying, survive in the
wild as you would say.  is this cool or what? {8-]

<p>
if anyone here is from outter scumbucket wyoming,
dont flame, just kidding, bygones, i like wyoming.  {8^D
vacationed there last year, hadda good time.  i like
massachusetts too, but ill be durned if see how the state
government figures a toll booth is a good idea.  here,
they just make a carpool lane, which stays nearly empty,
and charge the yahoos 271 clams if they get caught
driving single in it.  and they get caught almost every day.

<p>
thanks for the post roderick!  your heartfelt defense
of nh was inspiring.  {8-]  yours from the flatland, spike
