OK, dude.  It's time to clear up some loose rhetoric here.</a>

<p>
<a name="2990qlink2">Either you're advocating a return to the communist state of nature or
you're not.  There are several problems with the communist state of nature:
 first, it never existed.  Second, it only works (if at all) in small
groups, and even there with suboptimal efficiency.  Finally, and most
importantly, if we tried to make it exist, you'd run into the problem about
restrictions on use I mentioned in an earlier post.  ("Suppose Alice and
Bob are in a two person communist society...")</a>  

<p>
<a name="2990qlink3">If you're NOT proposing anarcho-communism, then I expect that you also
intend to create restrictions on the use of goods.  Unless these
restrictions are by unanimous consent, this is the definition of property.
Government by unanimous consent is simply the communist state of nature
(with all of its problems).  Government by any other means is
property-related.  State owned property, in your case.  And if property is
theft...

<p>
So, either you advocate state property rights, in which case you contradict
your statement that property is theft, or you don't, in which case you
contradict your statement that you aren't endorsing communism.

<p>
You can't have it both ways.</a>
