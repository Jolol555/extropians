<a name="1199qlink1"><a href="1189.html#1195qlink1">&gt;Since rationing TV time in a family is difficult, it may be best to</a><br>
<i>&gt;abstain altogether, difficult as it may appear in the first few weeks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is anybody aware of some basic study, e.g. as average TV hours/week</i><br>
<i>&gt;correlate with IQ?</i><br>

<p>
Such a study would be virtually impossible. Most children watch TV. Since
who don't watch TV would come from exceptional families (whether these be
Born Agains or Transhumanists) it would be pointless to try to do a
comparison with the two groups.<a name="1203qlink1"> I once thought about doing a study on
effect of television violence on children, but gave up for the same
reasons: most children watch television violence, the backgrounds of those
who don't are too exceptional use as a comparison.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="1199qlink2">I did try getting away from mainstream media for a while. So of 12 months I
didn't watch TV, radio, or the newspapers. It was a little disappointing
that during that time the USSR collapsed, the Berlin Wall fell down, and
Eastern Europe was freed.
