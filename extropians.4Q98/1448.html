Thank you for supporting my point. Before one can embark upon
enhancing a system, one obviously should have a deep level of
understanding about its modus operandi. Human designers can't 
create systems nonbrittle in respect to modifications, robust, 
self-healing or gracefully failing, very complex, autohomeostating 
&amp;c&amp;c systems. It's time we learn the trick. Hubris and ignorance 
don't mix well, at least not on the long run.

I disagree. I think at the heart of the malaise is the human hubris 
of believing we came up with the best metadesign scheme ever and 
pushing it onward despite of an impressive track of unfavourable 
evidence. Structures break, systems crash, people die. For instance, 
from my anecdotal experience, system design as software engineering 
is one of the most irrational human engineering endeavours. (How 
many unmet-schedule-all-nighter-pulling developers with a strong 
maestro streak do you know?) So far we've been at some level adaptive 
to systemic damage and occasional casualties, fixing the most glaring
holes -- but shielded from the worst of it that failures didn't 
autoamplify as of yet, and by the fact that (human-designed) brittleware 
doesn't evolve well. But this doesn't mean we will be immune forever. 
If our designs are really distinctly suboptimal, and someone comes 
up with a substrate less brittle in respect to evolutionary
optimization, or allows the mutation function to mutate as well 
we might be in for an eye-opening experience. A smart enough 
mutation function can do wonders to the field of GP. With GP, you 
won't have provably secure practical systems (which are as real 
as unicorns), but at least they will be robust.

<p>
Of course, this doesn't mean nature's ways are the best. We can 
do better than nature, and indeed we will one day. But please don't 
ignore tricks and metatricks nature came up with. It will be
difficult, particularly considering analysis of evolved fit, but
opaque solutions and creation of hybrid systems, but it should be 
well worthwhile.

<p>
Oh, and of course nature did invent the wheel. The flagella rotor
bacteria use for propulsion is of course a wheel, and driven by a nearly
100% efficient nanomotor at that. The reasons why macroscopic
organisms don't use wheels are more difficult. Too large valley
between two local optima peaks (rotor tissue invasculation 
trouble? rotors can pump as well) might be one thing, unsuitability 
of wheeled animals in natural rough terrain habitats might be another.
