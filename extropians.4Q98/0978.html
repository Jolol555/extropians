Hi Max M and list

<p>
Writing from lovely Denmark Max said:

<p>
<a href="0976.html#0978qlink1">&gt;there can be no freedom for the poor.</a><br>
We are as free as anyone else ;-)

<p>
<i>&gt;the free market is probably one of the best ways to distribute wealth. </i><br>
The market NEVER distributes wealth. It always increases net 
satisfaction, but it never distributes wealth. Only Gifts and Taxes can 
distribute.

<p>
<a href="0976.html#0978qlink2">&gt;But still there are plenty of people who has no money and never will have.</a><br>
There is no one who has no money. Especially in the sense of has no worth 
to others. How much would you pay for a life time of  houshold cleaning? 
That is the absolute minimum value. Remember too that economics are never 
about producing that which you are best at personally, it is always about 
producing that which you are relatively best at. Even if I am a better 
cleaner, if someone is a relatively better cleaner, I will pay them to do 
it for me if I am a relatively better neuro biologist.
  
<p>
<a href="0976.html#0978qlink3">&gt;those of us who has property and money also</a><br>
<i>&gt;give something of it away to those who has not.</i><br>

<p>
Each too his own. There is a thing in the talmud that I kind of agree 
with. Every 7 years, the fields were left for the poor to cultivate for a 
year.

<p>
love,
<br>
tim
