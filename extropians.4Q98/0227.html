<i>&gt;put in. I also seem to remember being told in a class that they have placed</i><br>
<i>&gt;electrodes into people amygdala's to control anger.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0242qlink1">All elementary psychology clases cover these experiments quite thoroughly.
They are very famous and are the basis for many sub-fields of neuroscience.
The original rat experiment was done by B.F. Skinner in the 50s and was
called "the skinner box." The implant was an electrode which was put into
the rat's hypothalamus (pleasure center of the brain which controls
sensations from eating, sleeping, sex). When an electrical stimulus was
provided by the subject, (in this case a lever the rat presses) the
interesting thing they noted was that the animal couldnt get enough
pleasure -- in other words they couldnt be satiated by the amount of
</a>pleasure. This was also done later in human subjects, and there was no
higher control found. Humans would press the button endlessly when it was
in their hands. There is a lot of old video footage of the experiments
where a girl is holding this box and hitting a button over and over and the
doctor asks her,<a name="0231qlink1"> "Why are you pressing that button?" (There were 3 buttons,
but only one stimulated the hypothalamus) and she replied by saying "it
feels good. Its like a sexy button" and the doctor asked "what exactly do
you mean by sexy?" and she replied "it feels like this button goes all the
way down." We had a good laugh about it in my psychoogy class.</a> 

<p>
About the bull experiment, that was similar technology but the electrode
was placed to deliver electric current to the amygdala, which is the
brain's center for both fear and anger (depending on the area of
stimulation). Anyways, the Doctor in the story activated the electrode and
the bull suddenly felt extremely scared of the matador and stopped dead in
his tracks. This has also been done to human subjects, and when the fear
part of the amygdala was stimulated, the subjects would go into giant panic
attacks and have intense feelings of death. When the anger part was
stimulated, they would go into bouts of rage. One patient described it like
this: "I just felt like I wanted to strangle the man interviewing me for
the experiment, and I had no idea why" 


<p>
This is very interesting research and has been done with most areas of the
brain, and the results are profound, and have probably taught us more about
why humans behave in the way they do than any other psychological
experiments. These experiments are still going on today, but are now
focused more on (big surprise) cognition and memory enhancement. 


<p>
Also, I have read "The Three Pound Universe" and it is a great book if you
are interested in a more biological and "hard science" view of the brain
and human behavior.
