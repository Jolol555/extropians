<p>
How does that show that free will is an illusion? I think it shows that we
do not have good introspective access to our internal processes. To
understand what's happening in our minds, we need science and technology,
not just introspection. But I don't see that Gazzaniga's results indicate
that we have no free will, if this term is used in some realistic way. By
"realistic" I mean in a sense like self-control rather than in a non-causal
way. I can't point to any work on free will that I find satisfactory, but
probably the best is Daniel Dennett's "Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free
Will Worth Wanting." Dennett takes a naturalistic approach to the subject.
