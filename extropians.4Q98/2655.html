Wrong. There is a form of nocoercive government. It is called a
hyperdemocracy. In a hyperdemocracy, it isn't one man, one vote, its one
man, one veto. Thus, nobody can be coerced into anything, as all it takes
to stop a new law is one veto against<a name="2740qlink2"> it. What is required to make such a
system work over the long term is that a) the original Constitution be set
up such that it guarrantees maximum functional freedoms to everybody
equally, but b) also give effective mechanisms for people to pursue
remedies to intrusions into their freedoms by others.</a> It should recognise
the market as the ultimate arbitrator of cost and value, and should set
some basic rules for the organization of cooperative organizations of
individuals such that they don't violate individuals freedoms, inside or
outside the organization. The articles in such a document should be vague
enough in general areas to allow for new technologies or cultural changes
without need for revision, but also be specific enough in the freedoms area
such that violators cannot dissemble and fudge the facts, and should be
clear enough about what is considered coercive government such that
individuals can easily take private legal action against the government.
The government should be subject to its own laws.
