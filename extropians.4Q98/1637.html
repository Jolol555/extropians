Abstract
<br>
  A mammalian model of genetically postponed aging would be an important tool
  to test not only different mechanisms of aging but also the
  predictive value of various biomarkers of the aging process.
  Under conventional conditions, the historical strains of
  the laboratory mouse produce
<br>
  their first litter between 9 and 13 weeks of age and have a
  median time of death in their 2nd year. Our
  POSCH-2 strain, which was derived from wild-caught Mus musculus domesticus,
  produces its first litter in the current breeding
  generations at approximately 47 weeks of age and continues to breed
  throughout its 2nd and into its 3rd year of life. The aging
  curve of POSCH-2 has not yet been determined for economic reasons. Late onset
  of breeding is a characteristic of both females and males, but
  sexual maturity is more reliably assessed in females.
  The later breeding phenotype of POSCH-2 is genetically
  recessive to early breeding of the C57BL/6J historical
  laboratory strain and, since POSCH-2 females can be induced to ovulate at 8
  weeks of age (but pregnancy does not result), the signal
  rather than the ovarian receptor to ovulate
  may be delayed. The genetically delayed reproduction and
  potentially longer life of the POSCH-2 strain appears to be
  a new trait in the mouse.
<br>
  The strain may be a useful mammalian model for aging studies
  and for the evaluation of antagonistic pleiotropy as a
  genetic model for the evolution of aging.
