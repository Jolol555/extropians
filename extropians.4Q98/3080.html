<a name="3089qlink4">It's hard to say exactly.  Perhaps that humans are infinitely adaptable,

model operating in real-time before I could put a name to my doubts.</a>

<a href="3070.html#3080qlink2">&gt;&gt;[W]e shouldn't be so quick to assume that the rest of the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;world will readily incorporate the value system that makes capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The market doesn't "incorporate" any value system. It maximizes whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt;(quantifiable) values the participants choose. Of course, the maintenance</i><br>
<i>&gt;of market *freedom* does depend (from the outside, as it were) on freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt;ranking high in (most) participants' value systems.</i><br>

<p>
Exactly.<a name="3089qlink7">  Certain Asian cultures have a much different perception of freedom
and the value of freedom than Americans do.</a>

<p>
<a href="3070.html#3080qlink3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Businesses have control over their employees for only as long as they</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;work for the business.  To me, the government is a very real and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;present danger to my freedom.  Each day that I work having to pay</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;taxes through the taxation of my company and through the taxes</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;deducted from my paycheck without my approval are very real to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I understand this point of view.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But you apparently don't "buy" it. Why not?</i><br>

<p>
Depends on what you mean.  I understand why you feel this way, and I don't
think you're wrong.  I just haven't internalized this viewpoint because my
attitudes preferences differ somewhat from yours.

<p>
<a href="3070.html#3080qlink4">&gt;&gt;&gt;Those productive dollars go to pay the salaries of people like you,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;who do not provide service based on the market.  Your job exists</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;because the government can arrest and punish those will not subscribe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;That seems a stretch.  Customer service polls show that most people are</i><br>
<i>&gt;very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;satisfied with the products and services my agency produces, so I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;there's something more to it than coercion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, for those who are satisfied. What about the rest?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3089qlink8">If you don't want to give your money, yet you are forced to, then you are
coerced.  I don't think most people feel quite this way, however.</a>  At least
<a name="3089qlink9">not to this extreme.</a>

<p>
<a href="3070.html#3080qlink5">&gt;Are you saying it's ok to coerce people as long as they're in the minority?</a><br>

<p>
No.

<p>
<a href="3070.html#3080qlink6">&gt;&gt;The particular product that my</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;division produces is most probably something that could not be produced by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the private sector.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's always the excuse, isn't it? But of course you're not willing to let</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "private sector" try, are you? And if it is something that a free</i><br>
<i>&gt;market wouldn't produce, what does that say about the actual value of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;product? Valuable goods don't have to be forced on anyone, people eagerly</i><br>
<i>&gt;pay for them.</i><br>

<p>
Sure I'm willing to try.  I don't really know how the value of the product
<a name="3089qlink10">we produce compares with the collective demand</a> for it.

<p>
<a href="3070.html#3080qlink7">&gt;&gt;(I'd rather not get into specifics, however, since</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;there's always the chance that someone reading this is not quite in their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;right mind.  I've been rather surprised at how mean-spirited some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;communication to this point has been.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The mean-spiritedness is an indication of the righteous indignation felt by</i><br>
<i>&gt;those of us who dissent from the view that our lives and livelihoods are at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the disposal of those in power.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3089qlink11">Trust me, I'm not "in power".</a>

<p>
<a href="3070.html#3080qlink8">&gt;&gt;I'm quite aware of how the government has expanded in size and scope this</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;century.  For the most part, however, I think the government's activities</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;are fairly harmless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Harmless? Forcible meddling in peaceful people's lives is "harmless"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Taking half of our wealth under duress to support market-strangling</i><br>
<i>&gt;regulation, persecution of "criminals" without victims, and war - that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;"harmless"? What would you define as "harm", pray tell?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3089qlink12">Persecution of "criminals" in victimless crimes is an abomination that we
must put an end to ASAP.  Ditto for the laws that allow the government to
seize property in drug-related cases prior to charging an individual</a> with a
crime.
