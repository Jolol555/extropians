Spike, agriculture is one of the most highly automated areas of our economy.
from a historical perspective, the job of agricultural automation is roughly
98 percent complete: it used to take 100 peasent farmers to support one
</a>
non-farmer, and now it takes one farmer to support 100 non-farmers. The
remaining chores to automate are bassically marginal. Even so, the land-grant
colleges spend a very large amount of time, money and effort on automating
these jobs. A great many farming operations are essentially one-person operations,
where the one person is the family farmer. This farmer's essential job is
decision-making. One measure of the extent of automation is the amount of
physical capital per employee. This number is very high for farming.

<p>
If you want to increase automation you'll need to look elsewhere. Right now,
the service sector is the biggest target, followed by things like transportation
and construction. I feel that the retail sector is currently beginning to see
a new wave of automation, driven by the internet, Of course, this automation started
early this century with the Sears Catalog.

<p>
IMO the "technical problem of eliminating labor" is quite difficult in the
construction industry.
