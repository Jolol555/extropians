  IAN: Overcoming suffering is not pseudoscience, there

  Buddhist/yogic technologies can be effective too, and
  those technologies are yoga and meditation, which are 
  proven to effect positive mental/physical states that 
  overcome "suffering." We might also add analysis, for
  a big part of Buddhist-enlightenment technique is the
  analysis of the nature of mind and an understanding
  of the connections between good and bad emotions. 

<p>
  Buddha's position was that there is no reincarnation,
  although you will not get that from reading much of
  the literature of Buddhsim I'd also have to crack 
  some books I've not read in years to be able to 
  debate that issue, but it is consistent with 
  the philosophy of the void-nature of mind.

  IAN: Fuzzy logic and holistic-identity structure
  confirm as logical the deepest Buddhist teachings.
  Despite the claims of many in this forum against 
  holistic identity, none have been able to find 
  an example of an identity that is what it is 
  free from holistic relations to what it isn't.

<p>
  The last argument against holistic identity as
  expressed via Zero mechanics, raised here was 
  that 0 is not more than -1, and thus 0 - (-1)
  would not equal 1, but it does! It's only too 
  clear that the cases raised against the zerosum
   holism implicit in Buddhist philosophy have 
  had to step outside both the empirical and logical 
  bounds as defined by our Western scientific standards.
