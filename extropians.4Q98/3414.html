I don't completely agree with this analysis of the theory behind
patent law.  While the intent behind patent law is to increase
innovation, I have never seen any optimization techniques applied
to the patent period.<a name="3462qlink1">  The recent change from 17 to 20 years was
to align U.S. patent law with GATT provisions.</a>  There are no public
policies that have the objective of maximizing innovation or purport
to maximize innovation.

<p>
Additionally, in my reading on the theory behind patent law, I have
never come across the idea that there is an inevitability to any
kind of innovation.  Your statement that "it would have been 
invented even without a patent system" implies such inevitability.

<p>
The purpose of patent rights is to foment and accelerate innovation 
by creating a mechanism to generate future cash flows to the inventor.  
Without this mechanism, no research and development project would 
<a name="3462qlink2">ever make it past the CFO of any company.</a>  Many innovations might
never be achieved without patent protection to justify the initial
investments in R&amp;D.
