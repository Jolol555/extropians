<a href="1199.html#1202qlink1">&gt;Why are you only considering those who watch and those who don't?  The</a><br>
<i>&gt;question asked refers to the *average hours/week* as related to IQ level.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1204qlink1">The problem here is that the you can't treat *average hours of TV
watched/week* as independent of lots of other variables that impact on IQ.</a>
For instance from memory you'll find that children from families with a
higher socio-economic status watch less TV. Of course you could control for
a factor like socio-economic status, but you'll still be left with the
problem that within any relatively homogeneous group the reasons why more
or less TV is watched is likely to have various impacts on the child that
affect IQ *independent* of how many hours of TV are watched.

<p>
I am not saying you couldn't do such a naturalistic study (and certainly
not that IQ and TV aren't related), just that it would be hard to get clear
results.
