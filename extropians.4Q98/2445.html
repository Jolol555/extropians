I can't tolerate socialists (democrats) but I find Republicans little better.
At least democrats are honest about what they intend to do....the republicans
lie about it prior to election and then vote like democrats after they get
elected.

<p>
Which may explain the last election.  You notice that all the republicans who
lost were "moderates".  That is...they got caught in their lies and were voted
out. The staunch conservative republican incumbents had no trouble staying</a> in
office.

<p>
<a name="2446qlink2">Actually I beleive a lot of people just decided to drop out of the
process...there was no choice actually....in cases where the "choice was
either a "moderate republican" or democrat there was really NO choice...so
many just didn't bother to lend credibility to the process...they staid home.

<p>
Then there was Jesse Ventura.  I wish I could have voted for him. 

<p>
Regarding the impeachment process....my opinion is the same as it has been.  I
want it to continue....he's guilty of purjury.  I heard it. 

<p>
I've listened to the House Judiciary Committee proceedings for the last many
hours on PBS as I drive down the road.  What planet is Maxine Waters from?
And that "lady" representative from southern texas makes me ashamed of my
state.  "Drive the mars explorer over to the flag the astronauts left?"....

<p>
Such is the quality of those who make decesions that affect our lives......
