Do you have inexpensive laser heads that could be adapted to through 
the air terrestrial communication systems?

<p>
I'm particularly interested in secure point-to-point broadband for 
wireless solid state (UNIX) proxies for stereo wavelet hdtv over the
internet.  Something like the black boxes mentioned in this article:

<p>
Perhaps roof mounted, with superscalar ram wafers adapted for use as
multi-gigabyte or terabyte ramdisks emulating SCSI hard drives in
shareware Linux proxies.  Possibly we could use small 3D 
micropositioning systems aim lasers between black boxes: maybe five 
or six such small ball-in-socket orbit joints to connect the rooftop 
communication nodes into a mesh or webwork of nodes?

<p>
I suspect that given the popular demand for high bandwidth, and the 
home electronics industry's willingness to mass produce HDTV flat 
panels for a low price, the DOD and DARPA will soon let go of
previously classified RAM fabs (technology that was once necessary 
for storing terrain maps in cruise missiles [which now use simpler 
GPS chip technology]).

<p>
It's my understanding that terrestrial laser heads used in
conjunction with solid state video proxies would enable rapid upgrade 
to ubiquitous broadband, enabling secure point-to-point or point-to-
multipoint hdtv (uncompressed), or wavelet compressed for 
entertainment and education applications.

<p>
I'm interested in using nonlinear hdtv (frame level access to feature
films) for a visual dictionary and online discussion forums that self
assemble according to psychometric criteria.
