Of which there are none, as a private organisation of the same size could
do it just as cheaply.

"Inappropriate"? By whose definition? 

<p>
Again, there are none; some would argue that area defence would come under
this category, but cheap nukes and other mass-destruction weapons make 
that perfectly plausible on an individual level.

Let me repeat that, to emphasise the point:

<p>

<i>&gt;COERCIVE then then a citizens relationship to another citizen who is </i><br>
<i>&gt;providing a service, and taxes are simply a bill for services rendered.</i><br>

<i>&gt;COUNTRIES FOR A CITIZEN TO "OPT OUT" of government services. </i><br>

<p>
I mean, what can I say? This is such an absurdly blatant and contradictory
statement that I have a hard time working out where to even start. You say
it's not coercive, and then point out that if you want to "opt out" the
government will send armed thugs around to beat and kill you. There's just
no rational comment you can make to such an irrational statement. 

<p>
<a href="2486.html#2495qlink6">&gt;My brother </a><br>
<i>&gt;feels that </i><br>
<i>&gt;allowing opting out would be a bad idea.</i><br>

<p>
Of course he does. Because all of us who get back far less in "services"
than we pay would immediately opt out, and the government would collapse.
Statist socialists have to use coercion because few productive people
will voluntarily work for the good of the state rather than their own
good. This is why socialism is blatantly absurd.
