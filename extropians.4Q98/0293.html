Need Interesting, Vibrant, Extropian Assistant

<p>
	Help, Before I sink!

<p>
	A cry of help rings out from a lifeboat in the midst of a dead sea of
intellectual mediocrity.

<p>
	By a quirk of fate, I'm stuck in a small to mid-sized Western
Pennsylvania town, surrounded by wonderfully honest, friendly,
hard-working but mostly unstimulating people.

<p>
	Here's what I have to offer my assistant:


<OL>
  <li>  A beautiful big new house to live in (Optional).
  <li>  Free extropian chow (if you live-in).
  <li>  Good company (me). 
  <li>  An unusually great opportunity to earn a fantistic income, if:

  <li>  You're an up-beat, positive energized person.
  <li>  You're smarter than I am (Don't worry, I'm probably the
dumbest     							
   person on this list).
  <li>  You're ambitious.
  <li>  You can follow directions and be creative at the same time.
  <li>  You're willing to kick me when I don't follow my own advice.
  <li>  You're a non-smoker.
  <li>  You don't do drugs.
  <li>  You can breeze through a thorough background check (civil,     
   criminal, credit, references, etc.)
  <li>  You take pride in your intellectual well-being.
  <li>  You take pride in your physical well-being.
  <li>  You're not obese.
  <li>  You're not too arrogant to be my student, but you're strong
enough 		   to be my teacher.
  <li>  You share my goal of an open-ended life-span.
  <li>  You know or are willing to learn the basics of the financial     
   markets.
  <li>  You have good telephone skills.
  <li>  You're computer literate.
  <li>  You're organized.
  <li>  You're neat and clean. 
  <li>  You're psychologically stable.
  <li>  You're a anarchist at best... or a Libertarian at worst.
  <li>  You're willing to temporarily relocate to Western Pennsylvania        
   (and maybe eventually to the San Diego area).


</OL>
<p>
Here's a little about me:

<p>
	I'm a middle aged, single straight male. The biggest influences on my
life were Ayn Rand, Galambos and Wallace Ward (founder of Neo-Tech).

<p>
	I'm a long-term cryonicist. I work out every day; stick to a healthy
non-vegetarian diet; pop supplements like peanuts; drink a little; work
a lot; don't read as much as I should... or used to; run a successful
home-based financial/marketing business and discovered I was an
immortalist around 25 years ago.

<p>
	What I need is someone with an active brain to help keep me on my toes,
to share good conversation with when I have time, to cross-pollinate
ideas, to help me grow my business and to share the income it generates.

<p>
	What I need is a kindred spirit - male or female, black or white, young
or old. Someone with a thick skin and a tender heart. Someone who
absolutely loves life and can't get enough of it. 

<p>
	So if you qualify and are interested, then email me at 
&lt;kekich@twd.net&gt;. 

<p>

P.S. I can be bawdy at times and a gentleman at others. I read mostly
business materials because of time constraints, but I do enjoy SF when I
can. I watch a little TV, mostly golf, movies, a sitcom or two, news and
an occasional football game. I have a strong, written, committed
personal code of ethics; love to joke around and trade insults; sleep a
tad more than I should; enjoy the good fortune of having lots of
long-term wonderful friendships and am slowly making my dreams come
true.
