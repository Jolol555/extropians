<p>
not necessarily.  openmindedness is partially an expression of congnitive
dissonance.  on the topic of religion, i am an atheist.  i have no cognitive
dissonance, consequently, i tend towards closed mindedness on that topic.

<p>
um... pray to that author?   i may have moved right from fundamentalist
to atheist on over to agnostic, i dont know.

<p>
the agnostic acknowledges a possibility of an unknown god, which is
tempting to me more these days.  consider: what if another society
elsewhere and elsewhen develops strong ai and nanotech, and makes
itself into a jupiter brain, or whatever.  (see what i learn from you
guys?  {8^D  )  i have no reason to exclude the possibility that such
a "god" has evolved somewhere and it hasnt found us yet.  perhaps it
is outside our light cone.  spike
