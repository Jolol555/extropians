<p>
<a href="1666.html#1716qlink1">&gt; The problem of digitizing private media is primarily one of efficiency. </a><br>
<i>&gt; One could, in a first step, use a scanner to make high-quality </i><br>
<i>&gt; images of all book pages. Then, eventually, OCR programs might </i><br>

<p>
Why don't we just ask the NSA (<a href="http://www.nsa.gov">http://www.nsa.gov</a>) for access to 
*their* archives under The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and NSA 
Declassification Initiative (The OPENDOOR Project).

<p>
Obviously, they would have everything digitized *already*, paid for 
with PUBLIC FUNDS.

<p>
They'd need to have everything digitized, in order to be able to 
break codes.

<p>
For example, what if I had some sort of code in which published books 
were used as translation tables.  My code would be a string of 
vectors that point to letters or words at a certain point on a 
certain page.  Long strings of these indirect references, translated, 
and you have a coherent message.

<p>
No way to break such a code without having the books digitized in the 
first place.  So, they must be there somewhere, right?  Scanned with 
public money, stored in publicly owned data warehouses, right?

<p>
And the music and movie libraries?  You'd need them for propaganda 
purposes, to help automatically select content for "The Game".  For 
example, have all song lyrics and all movie lyrics transcribed, with 
sample level time-code reverse indexes.

<p>
Why not just make it all available, through a new broadband ISP that 
pays subscribers $.111/minute (24x7), for the indignity of wearing 
GPS trackers?
