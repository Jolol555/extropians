  IAN: Ergo: all power to the master distributor.

<p>
  If people like the things Jones produces better
  than the things Johnson produces, why should not 
  Jones receive and uneven quantity of monetary compensation
   for his services from his neighbors? If
  society values Jones more, he should receive more.
  It seems to me that uneven distribution directed
  by social (people) demand is inherently ethical.

<p>
  Democratic votes in a political election are not 
  evenly distributed, so why must democratic votes be 
  evenly distributed in free-market selection? How can
  we know what society wants if we cannot allow it to 
  reward with more money those who do what it wants?

<p>
  Furthermore, consumer (people) directed distribution
   has proven to maximize net social welfare.
