<p>
Your assumption about my outlook is completely unfounded.  Besides, the
modern economy is founded on increasing consumer convenience.  Doesn't seem
like convenience is a bad thing at all.

<p>
I think that some have convinced themselves that they *do* know how A-C
would work.  I'm not asking for more theory, I'm asking to see the theory
put to the test.  Since the solutions provided by A-C should by definition
be beyond our capability to plan in advance, sitting around and talking
about what might happen when we smash the state doesn't help convince me.
And I'm not yet willing to bet the farm without some experimental support
for the theory.

<a href="3196.html#3204qlink6">&gt;&gt;Maybe a group of extropians could purchase</a><br>

<p>
You've got to start somewhere.  If you think converting the continental U.S.
to A-C would be easier then go that route.  I think you're asking for
unnecessary headaches by not test-running A-C on a smaller scale, however.

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think what</i><br>
<a href="3196.html#3204qlink7">&gt;&gt;I'm doing is a proper function of a minimalist government, i.e., serving</a><br>
as
<br>
<a href="3196.html#3204qlink8">&gt;&gt;an information clearinghouse and helping to keep the economic wheels of</a><br>
the
<br>
<a href="3196.html#3204qlink9">&gt;&gt;country turning.  </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why is that "a proper function of a minimalist government"? Surely </i><br>
<i>&gt;businesses can set up their own information clearinghouses? I certainly </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't see "serving as an information clearinghouse" mentioned anywhere in </i><br>
<i>&gt;my copy of the Constitution; do they give you a different version when you </i><br>
<i>&gt;join the Feds?</i><br>

<p>
The status quo can be justified with respect to Constitutional mandates, but
that's really beside the point.

<p>
There are certain useful economic metrics that cannot be produced unless
companies are willing to release sensitive and confidential data about their
operations.  To date, said companies have apparently not felt comfortable
releasing this data to anyone short of the government for fear that it might
be used against them.  They are however heavily reliant upon this data.
There *may* be an A-C way to get around this, but it seems to me that (a) a
central repository of business indicators is extremely valuable, and (b) a
centralized information clearinghouse is an effective means for producing
them.
