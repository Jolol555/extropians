Title
<br>
  alpha-Tocopheryl hemisuccinate
<br>
  administration increases rat liver subcellular alpha-tocopherol levels and
  protects against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity.

Abstract
<br>
  Rats were administered a series of tocopherol analogs 18 h prior to a
  hepatotoxic dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Of the compounds tested,
  only d-alpha-tocopheryl hemisuccinate (TS)
  provided significant protection against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. No
  protection was observed with either d-alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) or a
  tocopherol succinate ether derivative,
  d-alpha-tocopheryloxybutyric acid (TSE). None of the
  tocopherol analogs significantly inhibited CYP2E1 activity as measured by
  oxidation of p-nitrophenol. Liver homogenates and subcellular fractions
<br>
  (cytosol, nuclei, plasma membranes, mitochondria and microsomes) were<br>
  collected 18 h after tocopherol analog administration in the absence of CCl4.
  Homogenate and subcellular alpha-T levels were not significantly increased
  following TSE administration but were increased 2-3 fold following TS and
  alpha-T administration. Total tocopherol levels (alpha-T+ TS + TSE) in liver
  homogenates and subcellular fractions were highest in rats supplemented with
  TS. In these animals, TS was detected in all subcellular fractions and total
  tocopherol levels were increased from 6-23 fold over those seen in controls
  and 2-9 fold over alpha-T treated rats. In vitro studies in which liver
  homogenates and subcellular fractions were peroxidized with ascorbate and
  ADP/Fe suggest that increasing levels of alpha-T but not TS correlates with
  increased protection against lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that
  the ability of TS to protect against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity relates to
  its enhanced hepatic accumulation and subsequent hydrolysis to alpha-T.

Title

  The selective antiproliferative effects of alpha-tocopheryl
  hemisuccinate and cholesteryl hemisuccinate
  on murine leukemia cells result from the action of the intact compounds.

Abstract
<br>
  In the present study we have established that the antitumor activity of
  alpha-tocopheryl succinate (TS, vitamin E succinate) and
  cholesteryl succinate (CS) result from the action of the intact TS and CS
  compounds and not from the release of alpha-tocopherol, cholesterol, or
  succinate. We report that treatment of murine leukemia cell lines C1498
<br>
  (myeloid) and L1210 (lymphocytic), with the tris salts of TS or CS, but not<br>
  alpha-tocopherol and tris succinate or cholesterol and tris succinate,
  significantly inhibit the growth of these tumor cells and significantly
  enhance doxorubicin-induced tumor cell kill in a similar fashion. In
  contrast, the treatments mentioned above did not adversely affect the growth
  of murine normal bone marrow cells (colony-forming
  unit-granulocyte-macrophage). In fact, colony-forming unit
  granulocyte-macrophage cell growth was stimulated by exposure to CS and TS
<br>
  (as well as their ether analogues) at concentrations above 100 microM.<br>
  Furthermore, pretreatment of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage cells
  with TS or CS appears to protect these normal cells from the lethal effect of
  doxorubicin exposure. Selective inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation
<br>
  (identical to that noted for CS and TS) was also observed following the<br>
  treatment of cells with the nonhydrolyzable ether forms of CS
<br>
  (cholesteryloxybutyric acid) and TS<br>
  (alpha-tocopheryloxybutyric acid). These findings suggest<br>
  that TS, alpha-tocopheryloxybutyric acid, CS, and
  cholesteryloxybutyric acid may prove clinically useful as selective antitumor
  agents when administered alone or in combination with doxorubicin by a route
  that ensures tissue accumulation of the intact compound.
