A personal anecdote RE Frank Zappa: In my years in Seattle, I was roomates for a
year or so with a guy who owned a limo business, and frequently drove for him
(usually in the middle of the night for airport runs when he couldn't get
another driver). Once he picked up Frank Zappa at Sea-Tac airport and drove him
downtown to the Olympic Hotel. As they passed through the financial district,
Frank was sticking his head out the window yelling up at the skyscrapers,
<a name="3582qlink1">yelling,"You capitalist bastards!!!" (it was around 11pm). This from a guy
paying $100 an hour for a limo, who flew first class and was staying at the
presidential suite at the Olympic Hotel, and was playing to several</a> sold out
<a name="3582qlink2">crowds while in town.</a>
