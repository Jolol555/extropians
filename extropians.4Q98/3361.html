  But that is a rather irrational position. Suppose somebody actually
  manages to come up with a convincing experimental proof for a
  non-material soul (I would really like to see the methods and
  equipment section of that paper! :-), which was then independently
  verified, elaborated and studied in the classical scientific
  fashion. Would you still reject this interpretation, even when there
  were good evidence for another position? Of course, one might have
  different views on what constitutes enough evidence to change one's
  mind, but beyond a certain point one is joining the Flat Earth Society
  and creationists.

<a name="3378qlink1">What i was saying is just that i'm not open minded at all in loosing the

If non-material soul means new physical processes to study I can't have
something wrong with it.
<br>
But if non-material soul means something that is not connected to the
physics that build us... well it's total nonsense.

Since we put so much faith and cherish beliefs we can't be really open

<a name="3378qlink3">There is a difference in the global philosophy and the people following it.
Of course it is important that our views as emergent properties of our
interactions are strongly open minded. But look at the science methodology,
the global process seems to tend to some local optimum in the description
and understanding of reality and thus to be open minded. But I think a large
number of people doing sciences are acting also like obsessive compulsive
fundamentalists in their areas of expertise.</a>

<a name="3378qlink4">What is important for transhumanism is that his global belief-system seems
to be far more scientific, open minded, rational, self critical that the
others currently available. So what is the most important is that
publications about transhumanism appears to have such properties.</a>

It's, to some extent, the destiny of all belief-systems... I think.
Humans are beliefmachines... they tend to think that their arbitrary models
of reality are true.</a>
<br>
A lot of science guys tends to believe that their models are true, they
forget the easy way that they are just models. Science even if it's
evolutive is also a belief system.


<p>
There is nothing wrong to be *a little* non openminded. I mean, it's just a
interesting property of
<br>
our brain protecting us from time to time.
<a name="3378qlink6">What is irational is to believe that it is possible fo a human being alone
to be *strongly* openminded ;)... to be "too much" open minded is also to
loose time and energy that could probably be better used.</a>

I'm not sure, but i think there is a majority<a name="3367qlink1"> of atheists in this list...

<a name="3378qlink7">could you call it be open minded?

<a name="3367qlink2">What if somebody bring you a good scientific paper wich is a proof of the
existence of god ? What will you do</a> ? personnally, I will ask for a lot of
other papers and experiments, and if they are working too, well I will ask
to do the experiments by myself ;)... quite not open minded isn't?

  BTW; the babay analog is spurious. It just shows that intelligence is
  possible, just as biology shows that physical law allows nanotech. It
  does not say we can necessarily build it.
<br>
<i>"</i><br>

<p>
Why ?;)
<br>
Just find two compatible mates, non steriles and you are able to generate a
new intelligence.
<br>
In another way, understand the process and hack it, analyse deeply the
genome and play with it to generate new kinds of intelligences the slow
way... It's possible to build, but it's probably far too slow to be really
interesting.

<p>
But perhaps we will generate zombies in this way, since the soul is perhaps
not there ;))
