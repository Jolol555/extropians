these would be analogous to those who were born into the homes of
parents who are politically either reactionary or radical and who agreed
with their parents politics.  the theory does not insist one must arrive at
athiesm or agnosticism from some other point.

<a name="3432qlink1">personally, i rather envy those who are born into atheist/agnostic homes,
eliminating need to expend intellectual energy getting to reality.  (see
how closed minded i have become...  {8^D</a>  )

<a name="3432qlink2"><a href="3360.html#3362qlink2">&gt; And what of other religions?</a><br>

<p>
i dont know.  anybody?  i assume other religions must have something
analogous to christianity's spectrum of belief.  dont the jews have reform,
orthodox, and conservative?  muslims the sunni and whats the other
brand?  i dont know what buddhists have.  {8-]</a>
