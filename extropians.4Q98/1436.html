Good point, Peter.  In the example of autombiles, there's a wealth of
reputation information available through the "car press" and sources such as
Consumer Reports.  However, unfortunately, the former tend to be very
selective in their reporting (auto journalists like to drive and report on
GOOD cars, and they do take advertising revenues from manufacturers) and the
CR approach tends to be broad but not necessarily deep.  Likewise reputation
information from acquaintances and friends tends to be unsystematic.  Frankly,
as far as safety issues go (the original question), the adversarial system
tends to be well-focused and designed to allow a full airing of both sides'
evidence.
