I think it is important to do it. After all, transhumanism is about
questioning all limits taken for granted, be they human lifespan,
potential, intelligence or material scarcity. So why would social
structures be exempt from this questioning and attempts to find
improvments? The tricky part (in all these areas) is of course
actually finding improvements that can be implemented.

<p>
There are likely several groups like Aleph, that have no official
political views (members definitely have, though :-).

<a name="2517qlink1"><a name="2494qlink1">Something that has worried me a bit is that there are socialist
transhumanists, but they haven't managed to formulate how their views
fit together with transhumanism to the same extent that libertarian
transhumanists have</a> done (the libertarians of course claim this is
because it is impossible). This makes it hard to discuss the pros and
cons clearly, and to a large extent gives an undeserved walk-over to
the libertarians. So I repeat my request for somebody to try to write
up a concise "left transhumanism".</a>
