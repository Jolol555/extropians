<i>&gt;  past for a corporation to hide things, but this is no longer the case.</i><br>

<p>
With all due respect, this doesn't even come close to addressing the issues I
raised.  Saying that it's easier now to determine what a company's policies
are than it used to be doesn't mean it's a good idea to make shareholders
liable for a company's wrongs.  Imagine that I had instantaneous, searchable
electronic access right here in my study to every single record kept by
General Motors for the last twenty years.  Now, say you get a judgment against
GM next year based on a defectively designed airbag that failed to deploy in
an accident and you come looking to execute that judgment on my personal
assets.  Was I -- a non-engineer -- supposed to identify the records
documenting that defect before I bought some GM stock this afternoon?  If that
were the law, believe me that I would never put another dime into the equity
market and I would advise my clients to also refrain from doing it.

<p>
And you haven't addressed the cost to you as a judgment creditor of chasing
me, as a stockholder, to get your money.  Oh, and am I, as a stockholder,
supposed to defend myself personally in your airbag case?  If that's the law
-- even if I genuinely believed that GM would never make a design mistake -- I
would never buy their stock.

<a href="2748.html#3290qlink6">&gt;  &gt; A corporation's liability is reflected in its share price, so the market </a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; does</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; act to discipline equity holders.  And intentionally inadequately </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; capitalized</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; corporations can lead to "piercing the corporate veil" and thence to </i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt; personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; shareholder liability, so shareholders have a keen interest in seeing to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; that a corporation is sufficiently capitalized to satisfy judgments </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; against</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; it.  I don't see anything at all inconsistent with radical anarcho-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; in allowing corporate limited liability and corporate legal personhood.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  A corporation's liability is only reflected in its share price insofar as</i><br>
to
<br>
<a href="2748.html#3290qlink7">&gt;  estimate the outcome of a legal action given that the corporation can</a><br>
afford
<br>
<a href="2748.html#3290qlink8">&gt;  squads of high priced lawyers and the plaintiff usually can't, thus the </a><br>
<i>&gt; estimated</i><br>
<i>&gt;  outcome is on average going to be in the corporation's favor, thus the true</i><br>
<i>&gt; market</i><br>
<i>&gt;  liability is undervalued in the stock price. Corporate person fiction </i><br>
<i>&gt; sheilds the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  investor from the risk which equates to the returns they are expecting,</i><br>
thus
<br>
<a href="2748.html#3290qlink9">&gt;  improperly inflating the value of the stock, thus the investors costs are </a><br>
<i>&gt; being</i><br>
<i>&gt;  externalized onto potential plaintiffs against the corporation.</i><br>

<p>
Some of the best lawyers in the world are plaintiffs lawyers who work on a
contingency fee basis.  One thing that study of anarcho-capitalist legal
theory has made me do is change my mind about contingency fees: I used to be
opposed to them; now I favor them.
