Nope, but I do know of a guy who was a cook at a local restaurant who
was arrested by a state trooper he cooked breakfast for because the cook
put really hot tobasco sauce in his eggs....he got arrested for assault
and battery.....apparently the cop tried to make the charge to be
assault and battery with a deadly weapon since he claimed to have an
ulcer or something....

<p>
Yup totally unrelated, but funny anyways...

<a name="2466qlink1">On a related note, the old claim that email viruses were an Urban Legend
is supposedly now false, according to one company. A couple years ago I
claimed my hard drive got attacked thus, but everyone thought I was full
