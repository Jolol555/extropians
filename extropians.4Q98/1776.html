Although this thread was interesting while its lasted, I am *not*
necessarily opposed to the death penalty.  However, I think the death
penalty is not extropian as the title of this thread was asking.  My
personal feelings regarding the death penalty and whether it is
extropian or not, are two separate issues.

<p>
Like you, there are times in my humanness that I want to see someone die
for the cruelties they have inflicted on others.  But as an extropian, I
am constantly striving to transcend that humanness and all its emotional
(and sometimes savage) baggage that goes along with it.  IMHO, if we are
to truly reach a transhumanist society, the death penalty and all other
forms of killing will have to go.

<p>
Very Best Regards,
