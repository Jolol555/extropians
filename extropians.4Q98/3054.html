<a name="3323qlink3">So? Extropians are in general atypical.</a>

<a name="3323qlink4"><a name="3081qlink1">I think FTL travel is impossible (without shortcuts and tricks like
wormholes).</a> But I might be wrong, it might turn out that we discover a
way to do it. Have I been unextropian for not believing in this
possibility? Hardly, my position was based on known facts and rational

thought. The same goes for AI; we may debate the issue of it is going
to work or not much more and the interpretation of the facts isn't as
clear, but in the end you can reach the conclusion that AI isn't
possible given what you know and estimate and still be an
extropian. The unextropian thing would be to irrationally claim "AI
*must* be possible".

<p>
<a name="3323qlink6"><a name="3081qlink2">So? Suppose it really turns out that there are souls (of the kind
people commonly believe in). Would that invalidate extropianism? Not
the least, it would just mean we have to adjust our plans. Like for
example study how to make AI with souls.</a></a>
