It was me. Yes, I mentioned that cause that I what I am most familiar with. I expected the
warhead to be on the short side, and considering that its on a suborbital trajectory, it
should come in steep and fast.

<i>&gt; these come in steep and fast.  i can assure you, the entire reentry</i><br>
<i>&gt; event (interaction with sensible atmosphere) is very short, on the order</i><br>
<i>&gt; of 20 seconds, and not all of that is necessarily in the em signal loss regime.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; typical weapon-use reentry bodies would come in 20-40 degrees from</i><br>
<i>&gt; vertical and the velocity would go from around 8-10 km/sec down to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3-4 km per second, experiencing 60-80 g during that phase.  these are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not extremes, these are typical numbers.  spike</i><br>

<a name="2884qlink2">At what altitude is the 20 second phase at? If its at 200,000-400,000 feet, then This tells
me that the warhead has around a minute after reentry to get its bearings and make final
course corrections before impact. The fact that the reentry phase is shorter than I thought
actually makes GPS guidance easier.
