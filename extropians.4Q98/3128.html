I think, what is the use of getting to the future if you forget your past? Just
because everything isn't a cubist wasteland of mirrored glass buildings doesn't
mean its not forward thinking, its just that people don't want an architectural
style that many find repulsive polluting their landscape. I plan on living in a
log cabin till 100 years from now. I'll still have plenty of great technology
around.

<p>
I know, when I lived in Seattle, people thought that a building that was 100
years old was an old building! I'm like, geez, the first house I lived in as a
child was 175 years old, and still had a row garage for the buggy, wagon, and
sleigh. Ask any european what is considered an old building. However, I doubt
<a name="3180qlink1">very much that many silicon valley buildings are going to be considered
architectural treasures over time, even if any of them are still standing.</a>
