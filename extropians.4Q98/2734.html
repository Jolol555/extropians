Good deal!, Much as I think this whole Clinton deal is partisan politics at
it worst anything that keep the Guv'ment distracted prevents them from doing
real harm.

Well, it's 4:25 on Friday, and the House Judiciary Committee just 
approved articles of impeachment to be sent to the floor of the House 
for debate.

<p>
I suppose that we can forget any other sort of legislation getting to 
the floor before Christmas break, which may delay further restrictions 
on such technologies as cloning and fetal research.  I checked on 
pending bills, and only one had moved out of committee as of last week.
