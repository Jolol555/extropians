My apologies. I certainly wasn't thinking. You certainly do live in what I would
call a fascist state. Tyranny by a small party or tyranny of the majority is
irrelevant. The way the government down there is disarming anyone and everyone, I'd
be surprised if you Aussies are allowed to carry anything more dangerous than a
butter knife within a few years. As a North Korean defector once told a freind of
mine, "once we got their guns, taking their money was real easy."
