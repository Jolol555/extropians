<a name="1403qlink1">Having experimented quite a bit with float tanks, the brain certainly seems to
have a need to continue to process information, whether of an external or internal
nature.  John Lilly recommend the tank experience for that reason - it allowed the
user to process internal information that they would otherwise not be able to do
amongst environmental distractions.  In my experience, solutions to several
problems I was working on in frustration, revealed themselves while I was</a> in the
tank.

I have to disagree here.  I don't think an infant needs to process input in a
*rational* format in order to be aware of it - think of all the irrational people
out there! :-).  All healthy infants respond to environmental stimuli immediately
after birth.  I would call that response awareness.  Proving they are self-aware
however, may prove as difficult as doing it for anyone else.
