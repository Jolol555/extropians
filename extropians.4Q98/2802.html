I've just read the best paper I've seen in months!  It presents
a model which plausibly explains why "the nouveau rich flaunt their
wealth, but the old rich scorn such gauche displays.  Moderate
quality goods are advertized heavily, while high quality goods rely
on their reputation.  Minor officials prove their status with petty 
displays of authority, while the truly powerful show their strength 
through gestures of magnanimity.  The middle class are bastions of 
mainstream culture, while priviledged youth are drawn to 
countercultural lifestyles.  People of average education show off 
the studied regularity of their script, but the well-educated often 
scribble illegibly.  Mediocre students answer a teacher's easy 
question, but the best students are embarrassed to prove their
knowledge of trivial points.  Acquaintances show their good 
intentions by politely ignoring ones flaws, while close friends 
show intimacy by teasingly highlighting them.  People of moderate 
ability seek formal credentials to impress employers and society, 
but the talented often downplay their credentials even if they have 
bothered to obtain them. A person of average reputation defensively 
refutes accusations against his character, while a highly-respected 
person finds it demeaning to dignify accusations with a response."

Too Cool For School?  A Theory of Counter-Signaling

<p>
By Nick Feltovich, Rick Harbaugh, and Ted To

<p>
In sender--receiver games high--quality types can distinguish 
themselves from low--quality types by sending a costly signal. 
Allowing for additional, noisy information on sender types can 
radically alter sender behavior in such games. We examine 
equilibria where medium types separate themselves from low 
types by signaling, but high types then differentiate themselves 
from medium types by not signaling, or countersignaling. High 
types not only save the cost of signaling by relying on the 
additional information to stochastically separate them from 
low types, but in doing so they separate themselves from the 
signaling medium types. Hence they may countersignal even when 
signaling is a productive activity. To evaluate this theory we 
report on a two-- cell experiment in which the unique Nash 
equilibrium of one cell involves countersignaling by high types. 
Experimental results confirm that subjects can learn to 
countersignal.

The paper does a great job explaining the model and giving example
applications.  The experiments are a good idea, though poorly 
executed.
