It occurs to me that my opinion of this thread is exactly the same as my
opinion of the Kiersey sorter thread--gross generalizations being made on
very little data, with no real practical end result.

<p>
<a name="1568qlink1">I just came back from a visit to New York with Harry Hawk and Perry Metzger,
and thinking over our conversation, it wouldn't have been much different if
I had a male gender.  I am just as rational, just as IQ'd, just as capable
of comprehending math, science, and philosophy as they are, and they were
smart enough to realize</a> that.  My advice--stop wasting your time feeding
<a name="1568qlink2">into the social myth of gender intelligence differences and start
interacting with more intellectual women.</a>  In the long run, you will gain
more benefits.  You might even learn something.

Take care,
