  After looking through my files for the uses of  supplements  as an
adjunctive treatment for breast cancer, I was intrigued by the breast tumor
regression effect of high dose (390 mg/day) coenzyme Q10. A full double
blind placebo controlled trial of this supplement in the treatment of
breast cancer has apparently not been done, probably (IMHO) because this is
not a patentable (read profitable) drug. However the existing data is
encouraging. Following is an abstract I typed in of one report.

"Progress on Therapy of Breast Cancer With Vitamin Q10 and the regression
of Metastases"

<p>
Abstract:

<p>
  Over 35 years, data and knowledge have internationally evolved from
biochemical, biomedical and clinical research on vitamin Q10 (coenzyme Q10;
CoQ10) and cancer, which led in 1993 to overt complete regression of the
tumors in two cases of breast cancer. Continuing this research, three
additional breast cancer patients also underwent a conventional protocol of
therapy which included a daily oral dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10
(bio-quinone of Pharma Nord) during the complete trials over 3-5 years. the
numerous metastases in the liver of a 44-year-old patient "disappeared",
and no signs of metastases were found elsewhere. a 49-year-old patient, on
a dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10, revealed no signs of tumor in the
pleural cavity after six months, and her condition was excellent. A
75-year-old patient with carcinoma in one breast, after lumpectomy and 390
mg of CoQ10, showed no cancer in the tumor bed or metastases. Control blood
levels of CoQ10 of 0.83-0.97 and of 0.62 microgram/ml increased to
3.34-3.64 and 3.77 microgram/ml, respectively, on therapy with CoQ10 for
patients A-MRH and EEL.

<p>
Additional quote from the above research report:

<p>
  "previously observed that a dose level of 90 mg of CoQ10 in breast cases
for ca 8 months was ineffective, since only 6 of the 32 breast cases showed
even a hint of possible clinical regression on CoQ10."
