<p>
You can replace 'theft' with 'denial of access' if you like.
I was attempting to use a similar tone of language.

<p>
How about:
<br>
Everything is by default accessible to everyone.  People define objects as
'belonging to them'.  They then deny other people access to these objects.
This is wrong.  However, to encourage people to produce more efficient
objects and more of them and to allow for the most efficient production of
goods, they ought to be rewarded for producing them/copntributing to their
production.  Therefore they are allowed to deny people access to a
percentage of these objects.  The rest are accessible to everyone.

<p>
You would call the bits accessible by everyone 'tax' and the bits you are
</a>
allowed to keep 'property'.
