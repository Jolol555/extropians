Probably some have already read this paper, but i find it really
interesting. The site is also very interesting.

Abstract: Contrary to the popular notion that consciousness is the
result of a
<br>
noble evolutionary process, I speculate that this rather ill-defined
concept and
<br>
phenomenon may be the result of the fragmentation of an otherwise
completely
<br>
connected and totally ‘feeling’ universe. As various regions of this
universe
<br>
topologically pinch-off from the whole, connection-sparse boundaries
form over
<br>
which sporadic and impoverished information exchange takes place.
Supplied
<br>
with only scanty clues about the state of the external world, abundant
internal
<br>
chaos drives these small parallel processing islands into multiple
‘interpretations’ of the environment in a process we identify with
perception.
<br>
With further division of these regions by insulating partitions, the
resulting
<br>
subregions activate to lend multiple interpretation to the random
activations of
<br>
others in a manner reminiscent of internal imagery. The spontaneous
invention of
<br>
significance by this weakly coupled assembly of simple computational
units to its
<br>
own overall collective behavior is what we have grown to recognize as
biological consciousness. We thereby come to view human cortical
activity as a
<br>
highly degraded approximation to the original and prototypical cosmic
connectivity.
