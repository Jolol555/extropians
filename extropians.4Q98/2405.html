And who decides what my needs are? And who decides what my abilities are?
This is why communism is blatant nonsense; most people's needs are much,
much greater than their abilities, and hence no-state communism rapidly
degenerates into bureaucrats fighting over scraps. The only way communism
can work is in small voluntary communities or groups with a massive 
productive surplus; it cannot work on a large scale.

I certainly noticed that when the USSR collapsed my commie friends suddenly
started claiming it was "state capitalist", not communist. No, no, communism
didn't fail, if it failed it must be capitalism, because communist ideology
tells us that capitalism must fail and communism must succeed.
