IN THE FOLLOWING PAPER,

"On the basis of the perceptual control theory 
of Powers, the market mechanism is analysed as
a negative feedback loop..."

LATER, HOWEVER:-

<p>
"Wealth and poverty tend to be self-reinforcing. 
Poor people do not have the means to get a good education,
to start a business, to invest money, or do any of the 
other things which typically lead to high income. This
vicious circle or positive feedback loop can only 
be broken by outside intervention, e.g. by the government
providing free education, or subsidizing business start-ups."

<p>
THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT MONEY IS A FAULTY FEEDBACK COMPONENT

<p>
"An even more challenging issue for further research 
is the cognitive development of the economic control
system. The analogies with neural mechanisms of learning 
we proposed barely scratch the surface of this
problem domain. Further inspiration may be found 
in some more detailed models for distributed,
supra-individual learning via computer networks 
which we proposed earlier (Heylighen &amp; Bollen, 1996;
Bollen &amp; Heylighen, 1996). Computer and communication 
technologies provide particularly effective ways to
implement an efficient "nervous system" for the 
socio-economic organism. We already discussed the
example of the computer-controlled stock exchange 
to illustrate the enormous gains in sensitivity that 
can be achieved in that way. 

<p>
In addition to the software agents and learning 
hypertext webs discussed in our earlier papers, the 
software technology based on "workflow" holds particular 
promise. The main idea behind workflow is that tasks,
belonging to a larger project, are automatically 
sent by the computer system to the person or group best
qualified to handle them. Once a part of the job has 
been finished, the provisional results together with the
subsequent questions are forwarded to the next one in 
line, and so on. For example, the manufacture of cars
requires the completion of a number of subtasks, such 
as buying tyres, steel, plastic, etc. An automated
computer system, when receiving an order for a certain 
amount of cars would automatically order the
required amounts of tyres and other components 
to the suppliers that make the best offer, and continuously
monitor in how far the orders are fulfilled. By comparing 
orders fulfilled by different producers, it might even
learn which suppliers are most reliable and efficient 
and take this into account when making further orders. 

<p>
Such technologies could make the socio-economic system 
much more efficient and intelligent, providing it
with a real "global brain" (Heylighen &amp; Bollen, 1996; 
Russell, 1996; de Rosnay, 1996; Mayer-Kress &amp;
Barczys, 1995). Further development of the control 
system model of the economy and the distributed
cognition structure characterizing it may help 
us to support that development."
