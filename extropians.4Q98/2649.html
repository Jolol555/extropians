<a name="2665qlink2">So, you're a psychologist, Scott:  In general, how well-adapted to
society are we extropian/transhumanist/cryonicist types?</a>

<p>
<a name="2665qlink3">I'm a "genius" as defined by my &gt;=98th percentile scores on certain
standardized "guessing" tests, and I'm sure that most of the others on
this email list are as well. All it means, in some respects, is that,
as a child,  I preferred the company of books and ideas to that of my
fellow humans, at least to a certain degree.

<a name="2665qlink4">Am I happier/more stable/more well-adapted  in general than most
people? I wouldn't say so.</a>
<br>
<a name="2665qlink5"> But that doesn't go for all geniuses: My cousin Scott seems a happy
person.

<p>
<a name="2667qlink1">On the other hand, the prisons are full of maladjusted sorts, who, to
all appearances, are just about as far as possible from being
"geniuses."</a>
