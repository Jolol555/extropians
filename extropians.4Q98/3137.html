<p>
No, of course that's not what I mean by coercion. Coercion is infringing on
someone else's freedom, not giving up your own.

<p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, you're right, but I think that most people associate
cooperation with mutual consent, at least by default, don't they?

<p>
So that our dialog is unambigous as possible, when I use the word
"cooperate", assume I mean "voluntarily cooperate". When I write "coerce" I
mean "initiate or threaten force in order to compel another's compliance".

<p>
I don't advocate being a lone rebel. I advocate association for the purpose
of rebellion.

<p>
<a name="3330qlink2">I don't think it's rational at all. If you sacrifice freedom, you've
already defeated yourself. How are you going to reap autonomy</a> by a process
of surrendering</a> it?

<p>
<a name="3242qlink2"><a href="3125.html#3137qlink5">&gt;Because one person's freedom is another person's oppression.</a><br>

<p>
This is a fundamental misconception. To make clear what libertarians mean
by freedom: my freedom is the ability to live _my_ life, using _my_
resources as I see fit, without forcible interference; so is yours. It's
not possible to uphold my freedom without at the same time upholding yours.
Freedom in this sense cannot be oppression.</a>

<a href="3125.html#3137qlink6">&gt;At the very least you can't allow people to steal, rape, murder,</a><br>
<i>&gt;pollute and damage property freely.</i><br>

<p>
Of course not. To allow such things is to betray freedom. You may have
noticed that these are common practices of our supposed protectors who call
themselves "government". Exactly what I stand against.

You need to support this. I hope to hell you're wrong.
