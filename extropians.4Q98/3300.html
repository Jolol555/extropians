<a name="3345qlink1">Software patents are  really bad. Criminal in fact. This is why Richard 
Stallman is so  important. They essentially place a lien on the future 
mental work of other people.</a>

<p>
Case in point: when you move a mouse, the little bit of screen that was 
behind the mouse has to be redrawn. The obvious solution is called 
"backing store" - when you draw the mouse you copy what was underneath 
into a little store, and then when you move on you redraw from the 
backing store. Almost anyone faced with this problem would invent this 
solution. The alternatives (such as asking the application that own the 
screen to redraw it from scratch) are just so inefficient.

<p>
However, it is illegal to use this unless you pay a royalty to the patent 
holder. That is just plain BS. The law essentially says that older people 
have have a right to earn a living off<a name="3359qlink1"> of younger people (who because 
they are younger will come up the solution later). It is wrong.</a>

<p>
<a name="3345qlink2">The defence of this law is pathetic: that innovators will not think of 
backing store unless they have a right to stop others from using this or 
to make them pay. Of course people will invent baking store: they need it 
for their programs.

<p>
Copyright is a completely different ball game. I am glad to see copyright 
on software just as on books. But patents are like saying no one else can 
do physics without paying Feynman.</a> 

<p>
I encourage you all to learn more about this topic: it is really very 
central to our shared freedoms.

<p>
cheers,

"The reason I care especially," said Stallman, "is that there is a 
philosophy associated with the GNU project, and this philosophy is 
actually the reason why there is a system -- and that is that free 
software is not just convenient and not just reliable ... More important 
than convenience and reliability is freedom -- the freedom to cooperate. 
What I'm concerned about is not individual people or companies so much as 
the kind of way of life that we have. That's why I think it's a 
distraction to think about fighting Microsoft."
