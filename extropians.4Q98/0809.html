<p>
 It's not my idea, but I saw the interview of an author speaking about
one of his book (that I haven't found yet). In his book he explains that
the current world is divided not in countries, but in civilizations.

<p>
  A civilization being a group of people who share common values, such
as religion, history, geography, language, legends, resources, political
systems, technology...etc.

<p>
   You will probably agree that there is effectively an 'occidental'
civilization. Started in europe, now all across the atlantic and in
australia.

<p>
    We can also speak of an indian civilization, a muslim (or arabian),
a chinese, a slavic (east europe-russia), an african. He added a
japanese one.

<p>
     On the moment I was hearing about it, I didn't notice it as -that-
ground breaking. But nowadays, I use it more and more as a world model.
Although I'm not sure there are exactly 7 civilisations (why not add
turkie or remove japan, what about south america etc...), the concept
looks more powerfull to me than countries or continents or skin colors
or cities...

<p>
      Manu.
