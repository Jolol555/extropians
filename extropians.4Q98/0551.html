My company routinely gets letters from customers asking for our
compliance statement, and we have sent letters to our vendors.
I therefore assumed that this has become a standard practice.

<p>
Congress recently passed new legislation which makes it harder
to sue a company based on that company's good-faith effort to
provide such info. Many companies had already put a bunch of
stuff one their web sites about their products' compliance, and
I expect to see more. There is good deal less about a company's
ability to continue to operate, though. that is, I can tell that
the equipment suppied by a vendor will continue to operate, but
I can't tell whether the vendor will continue to be able to deliver
product.
