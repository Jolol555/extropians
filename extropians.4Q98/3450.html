<p>
That depends on the origin of homosexuality. The currently most
popular theory (?) suggests that it is a complex interaction between
intrauterine environment, especially hormones from the mother (likely
a surrogate mother in this case; part of the inheritance of
homosexuality seems to be explainable as mother-linked genes that
might affect this), genetic predisposition (of unknown size once you
factor out the mother's contribution) and upbringing.  If you make a
clone of yourself with one sex chromosome changed (it isn't a clone in
that case, we might need another term for it) his sexual preferences
will likely be heterosexual. Whether the clone of a homosexual person
would be homosexual is an interesting question. My guess is clones
with different surrogate mothers would have correlated preferences
similar to siblings or so.

<p>
(Isn't this thread getting silly? Or perhaps it was utterly silly from
the beginning.)
