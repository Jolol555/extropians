 I would tend to turn the problem around. Privacy is the natural state,
as the low side of communication volume -&gt; we can't communicate
perfectly with the rest of society. We are prisoners of our own skul,
individuality: we can't -physically- share all information with the rest
of society.

<p>
  There is an old BW french movie with young rebel jean paul belmondo
(for those who know), and he talks about the sentence "sleeping with
someone"*. Arguing that in fact we don't really sleep with, we merely
sleep beside someone!

* as in sleeping, not having sex of course :-)

<p>
BTW, fill me for ENFP. Although I would tend to identify with ENTP. I
can't believe that distinction between soft and hard hearted...
