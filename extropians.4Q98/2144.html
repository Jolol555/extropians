<a href="2126.html#2144qlink1">    &gt;apparently nobody got the implications of the Transactional</a><br>
<i>    &gt;Interpretation till John Cramer's work in 1986 which demonstrated that given the</i><br>
<i>    &gt;apparent proof of the accuracy of Feynman's QED interpretation,  then parallel</i><br>
<i>    &gt;universe theory is bunk.</i><br>

<p>
Physicists believe in QED not because of philosophy but because it
gives the correct answers. Feynman predicted in 1948 that the magnetic
moment of an electron can't be exactly 1 as had been thought because it's
effected by an infinite (and I mean infinite not just astronomical) number of virtual
particles. He brilliantly figured out a way to calculate this effect and
do so in a finite amount of time, he calculated it must be  1.00115965221
Amazingly,  the best modern experiments give a figure of 1.00115965221
with an uncertainty of 3 in the last digit.

<p>
<a name="3549qlink1">The trouble with Quantum mechanics isn't that it has no interpretation  it's
that it has too many and they all work. Everett's many</a> world interpretation is
<a name="3549qlink2">consistent with all experimental results performed up to now, the same</a> is true
<a name="3549qlink3">of John Cramer's Transactional  Interpretation, or David Bohm's Pilot Wave
Interpretation or Niels Boor's Copenhagen Interpretation. Which one is right?
All of them?  None of them?</a>

<p>
Just for fun in the 1980's L David Raub polled 71 physicists if they thought in their
gut the Many World's interpretation was true,  59% said yes, 18% no, 13% said maybe,
Feynman said yes and so did Richard Hawking, Penrose said no ; not that this is
something a vote can decide.
