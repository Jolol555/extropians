Dan,Don't get me wrong: my post about John's answer was not in any way
meant to cast doubt on his answer (in fact, re-reading yr. post, I don't
think you had in fact taken me amiss) but simply a statement of where
I'm at with all this: drowned-cum-drowning, but thrilled, and
alternatively depressed/excited at everything I want to learn.

This is really kind of you: truth is, I must confess to have merely
restated -in my own fashion- the sbustance of Tipler's notes on topic,
and some other stuff that i'm wrestling with.My background is in French
literature! and that, at only an undergraduate level: i'm a
<a name="0802qlink1">teacher/cab-driver who has been smitten/bitten by reading Damien
Broderick's very readable The Spike.

I'm definitely the poor cousin on this list;</a> thank God it is so friendly
here, and this is due to people such as your good self.

<p>
Have a great day!
