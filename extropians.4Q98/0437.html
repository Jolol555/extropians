Uh, arn't these called sex toys? :-)

<a name="0461qlink2">I've been inventing, developing, prototyping, and testing technosexual
devices for many years now.</a>  I have many extremely unique, but so far
unpatented designs, some of which would cause you to collapse in
laughter upon hearing the details.  I know *I* did when I first
thought up the ideas.  Many of my designs are intended to enhance
partner sex, but training has been most effective with solosexual
activity.  I'll be glad to post descriptions and links to the list as
soon as I have protected my intellectual property.  However, with one
</a>
of my devices, I can give somewhat of a description without giving
away the farm, because much research is needed to make it work from
the description.  

<p>
<a name="0463qlink1"><a name="0461qlink3">It is a biofeedback technosexual stimulation device designed to teach
the capability of having a long series of intense orgasms (up to 12
hours in some test subjects, chemically aided of course).</a>  The
</a>
<a name="0461qlink4">stimulation is a complex function of input from a sensor on the PC
muscle. The PC or Pubococcygeus muscle goes around the anus, across
the entire pelvic floor, and attaches in front to the pubic bone on
both women and men.  To locate this muscle, simply stop the flow of
urine. A weak PC muscle will result in urinary incontinence.</a> 

<p>
Many sex therapist think that to keep your PC muscle toned, you should
consciously squeeze and release it during masturbation and partnersex
to intensify each orgasm. These contractions can be felt in the anus,
vagina, clitoris, and penis (if you have *all* of those, your doing
very good :-)).  They also recommend tightening and releasing it as an
exercise throughout the day, to improve your functioning.  I disagree
with the former and the later for different reasons.  Both of which
are overcome by training from<a name="0461qlink5"> my machine which develops "fast
reflexive" muscles designed for extreme involuntary contractions of
<a name="0461qlink6">the PC muscle.</a>  I'm not ready to say much more about my devices on the
wider list yet, but hopefully will within the next year.  That is, if
I ultimately decide they are transhuman in nature, some of them
</a>
certainly are.  

<p>
<a name="0461qlink7">The ones with biofeedback from the PC muscle are far too addictive to
make available as a commercial product and not expect legal problems. 
Of course, I *will* do it anyway :-).  Coming soon to a net-store near
</a>you.

<p>
<a name="0461qlink8"><a href="0418.html#0437qlink2">&gt; Now, can anyone tell me: why on earth isn't this product on</a><br>
