<a href="3210.html#3342qlink1">&gt;I don't get the point of your response, Samael. Why do you refer to a</a><br>

<i>&gt;market demand. It has little in common with an organization that claims a</i><br>
<i>&gt;monopoly on the use of force in a certain territory, and prevents</i><br>
<i>&gt;competition by force of arms.</i><br>

Samael replies:
<br>
<a href="3318.html#3342qlink2">&gt;Because many, many people believe that their government is acting</a><br>
reasonably
<br>
<a href="3318.html#3342qlink3">&gt;(at least some of the time).  They are happy (ish) with their</a><br>
<i>&gt;representatives.  While it is not a true PPA, it is acting as if it thinks</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is (governments frequently refer to themselves as servants of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;people).</i><br>

<p>
I've noticed that irony too.

<p>
<a href="3318.html#3342qlink4">&gt;However, it's an organisation that's now claimed a monopoly on</a><br>
<i>&gt;it's area (although I've seen it claimed elsewhere here that PPA's would</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to have a monopoly on the area they cover) and is 'out of control'.</i><br>

<p>
A-C theorists don't generally make that claim, however - it's an incorrect
(IMO) objection raised by minimalists (and certainly by any statists who
take the trouble to investigate A-C). I think it says more about ingrained
habits of thought than about the feasibility of a market for liberty.

<p>
<a href="3318.html#3342qlink5">&gt;Strikes me as a likely situation in a libertarian society, and therefore</a><br>
<i>&gt;something you ought to be able to cope with.  So why aren't you?</i><br>

<p>
Because I see no reason to believe that it's a likely situation. Why do
think it is?

<p>
I've already given my reasons for considering it unlikely, and outlined
possible defenses against the remote eventuality. How about addressing my
points?
