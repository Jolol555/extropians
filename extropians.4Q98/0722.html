<i>&gt; Yes, but few of them have the "big picture" or the attitude to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; the technology for themselves. The guys that created the first </i><br>
<i>&gt; A-Bomb were only allowed to "play" with it under strict government</i><br>
<i>&gt; supervision, and the same will most likely be the case here. Of</i><br>

<p>
It would have basically been impossible for an engineer or small
group of them to build more A-bombs in secret.  A-bombs do not
manufacture more.

<p>
<a href="0721.html#0722qlink3">&gt; course, it could be that a group of scientists would keep the tech</a><br>
<i>&gt; for themselves and become gods, but it's not very likely. Wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; mentality; they'll just meekly hand over the tools for godhood to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their masters.</i><br>

<p>
I don't know that scientists are any more likely to meekly
hand over anything than other people...
