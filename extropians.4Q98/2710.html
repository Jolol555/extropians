<i>&gt; &gt; From what I have read on this list on this topic, (and compiled</i><br>
<i>&gt; below) it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; seems that the points brought up about education in this thread are:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1.    Free education at a basic level.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2.    Teaching of logic and thinking skills</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 3.    Private schools providing a "free market" competitiveness</i><br>
<i>&gt; between</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; schools</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 4.    Nothing of everyday application learnt in school.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 5.    Poor people not getting an education</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 6.    Inadequate advancement of brighter students</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 7.    School placing too much emphasis on developing socialization</i><br>
<i>&gt; skills</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 8.    Same age =&gt; same education</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 9.    Education leads to raised output and higher GNP.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A suggestion to compiling all of this into a workable and usable</i><br>
<i>&gt; education</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; philosophy would be schools that are free at a primary level to</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; regardless of social standing. This would hopefully 'help' the</i><br>
<i>&gt; poorer people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to get a better life by being educated, rather than leave them</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolutely no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chance to get out of their situation. It would help if this primary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; education would be compulsory. This would definitely help in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; country's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; literacy rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; !!!!  When are you collectivists going to learn that there's no such</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing as a "free" education??!!!??</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If by "free" education you mean one supported with tax money, then you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are advocating a "free" education supported with violence - the</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercion of taxation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It doesn't matter how benign your intentions are, any governmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; fooling with prices at any level is detrimental to the economy as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole.  Any form of involuntary taxation is theft, and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; immoral.</i><br>

<p>
If the government legalized drugs, prostitution and gambling, and 
started offering these services itself, perhaps there could be an
(almost) tax-free welfare state. Certainly if you invest in automating
society. Human workers are generally less reliable than machines,
and cost more too. Furthermore, most jobs are a blunt violation
of human dignity. Society will only become truly civilized when
people no longer have to perform slave labor on a daily basis in
order to make ends meet. And no, I don't think you need nanotech
to achieve this; we have the tech, but apparently lack the will to
use it.
