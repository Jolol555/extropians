<p>
A bit of a strawman argument no? Do you really mean to say that if TV leads
to violence then its the only cause of violence?</a>

<p>
<a name="1206qlink3">More to the point: I don't think critics of TV violence are trying to say
that TV leads naturally to more violence, but perhaps desensitization</a> to
<a name="1206qlink4">it. Some argue that it is bad that we teach our children through television
that violence is a game and that death is not important. There is some
bizarre statistic that by the time a child reaches 15 they've seen upwards
of 10000 deaths depicted on television.</a>

silly to misrepresent the argument.</a>

<p>
I wasn't aware that most children's shows dealt with real problems. Did I
miss that episode of Scooby Dooby Doo or Lost in Space? OK. So I'm showing
my age, but I do not believe TV shows have become that much more socially
relevant in the intervening years (nor perhaps should they).</a></a>

<p>
<a name="1206qlink7"><a href="1203.html#1205qlink3">&gt;Thus you can argue that TV is a source of less violence.</a><br>

<p>
Without proper studies you can pretty much argue anything.</a>
