No clue at this point and no time to do so. Try some internet searching....

<i>&gt; &gt;One less bad genetic sequence at a time, the world gets better with each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;execution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You apear to be taking genetic determinism a bit far- there are cultural and</i><br>
<i>&gt; social factors involved too.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It gets even better if that sequence elemination can be used in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;effective propaganda to deter others from making the same mistake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunaltely I can't remember where I read the study on the effectiveness</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this sort of propaganda but it did seem to show it wasn't effective.</i><br>

<p>
I've commented that Prof. John Lotts study of FBI crime stats indicates that the
death penalty, as it is practiced today in the US, has little to no effect on
deterring violent crime. I've also commented that since increases in private
citizens being able to carry concealed weapons has a large influence on violent
crime (it drops as gun control laws are eased or repealed), then the best form
of death penalty is that which occurs as close to the crime scene in time and
space as possible. So the death penalty is useful, but its utility is dependent
on its, er, execution, no pun intended.... ;)
