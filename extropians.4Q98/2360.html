Starlab ? at the VUB? could be very interesting, for sure... would you
like to tell a little more what is it about?

Yes, I live in Belgium, in the french-side, at something like 1 hour of
BXL if you use car.I can't be sure it will be possible for me.
All I can tell is : that could only be possible for me the 17th and
perhaps the 18th.
<br>
Ah, I've never see a true transhumanist in the reality media. Would like
to check if they are really peoples ;)
<br>
I'm really not sure if I can bring you something Doug, especially if I'm
alone to meet you and discuss with you. I'm the kind of guy who dislike
a lot the one-to-one type of conversation, but if we are a few number...
say 3 ;)... it could be very enjoyable for me.

<p>
Have you already a schedule defined? some time constraints,...
Because I will probably have some constraints on the time too ;(

<p>
Hey, if there are other transhumanist or like minded spirits in Belgium
they should tell me because sometimes i'm feeling a little alone ;) ...
especially if they are hugely beautiful and intelligent babes interested
about making things (*) with probably one of the few aware and caring of
this great m-plex in this country ;)...

<p>

<p>
(*)
<br>
(well, of course it depend of your sets of goals, not(sexy babes) will
surely be strongly appreciated but essentially to build or try to build
some kewl project together or at least to discuss about that and the
topics)
