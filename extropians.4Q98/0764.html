Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prescribing exercise in several short-bouts
  versus one long-bout per day would enhance exercise adherence,
  cardiorespiratory fitness, and weight loss
  in overweight adult females in a behavioral weight control program. DESIGN:
  Randomized controlled trial with subjects randomized to either a short-bout
  exercise group (SB, n = 28, age = 40.4 +/- 5.9 yrs) or a long-bout exercise
  group (LB, n = 28, age = 40.9 +/- 7.3 yrs), with subjects followed for a
  period of 20 weeks. Both groups were instructed to exercise 5 days per week
  with exercise duration progressing from 20 to 40 min per day. The LB group
  performed one exercise bout per day, whereas the SB group performed multiple
  10 min bouts of exercise per day. The recommended caloric intake for all
  subjects was 5022-6277 kJ/day (1200-1500 kcal/day), with fat reduced to 20%
  of caloric intake. SUBJECTS: Fifty-six obese, sedentary females (BMI = 33.9
  +/- 4.1 kg/m2). MEASUREMENTS: Exercise participation was assessed from
  self-reported diaries and Tri-Trac Accelerometers.
  Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed
  using a submaximal cycle ergometer test. RESULTS: Exercising in multiple
  short-bouts per day improved adherence to exercise: the SB group reported
  exercising on a greater number of days (mean +/- s.d. = 87.3 +/- 29.5 days vs
  69.1 +/- 28.9 days; P &lt; 0.05) and for a greater total duration (223.8 +/-
  69.5 min/week vs 188.2 +/- 58.4 min/week; P = 0.08) than the LB group.
  Predicted VO2Peak increased by 5.6% and 5.0% for the LB and SB groups,
  respectively (P &lt; 0.05). There was a trend for the weight loss to be greater
  in the SB group (-8.9 +/- 5.3 kg) compared to the LB group (-6.4 +/- 4.5 kg;
  P &lt; 0.07). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that short-bouts of exercise may
  enhance exercise adherence. Short-bouts of exercise may also enhance weight
  loss and produce similar changes in cardiorespiratory
  fitness when compared to long-bouts of exercise. Thus,
  short-bouts of exercise may be preferred when prescribing exercise to obese
  adults.
