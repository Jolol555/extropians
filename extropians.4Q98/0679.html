  IAN: There is (1) an individual, like Crusoe, and 
  (2) a political individual, which is an individual 
  in a society, i.e., a "social individual." The term
  "political" refers to identity attributes of the 
  individual that are derived from social relations.

<p>
  The dual states of the individual cited "quench" 
  the purported  contradiction: (1) is the absolute 
  individual Crusoe, and  (2) is the relational, and
  thereby political, individual. Both are individuals.

<p>
  That there are social relations in a market society
  and a set of rules of conduct, which thereby define 
  the political, does not negate a set of rules that 
  define and defend private property and liberty.

<p>
  So the "social individual" is not a contradiction,
  neither is the individual as the basic social unit,
  and as such, the individual as basic political unit. 



<p>
<a href="0670.html#0679qlink2">&gt; The individual may be a type of</a><br>
<i>&gt;political unit but hardly *the* basic one. I would be happy to accept</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: Well, of nonzero positive integers, 
  1 is the basic unit, and in the same way
  it would appear that 1 person is the basic
  social unit. Of course, I guess we could go
  so far as to say that it's one cell or atom.

<p>
  We are a collection of "humanized atoms," 
  perhaps soon to be "transhumanized atoms."
