 I agree its a turnoff for many people. But for me, it speaks to a core belief
which I hope is common to the group. Humanity is not the peak and pinnacle of
all that possible, just a step on the path. Its acceptence of this wider range
of possibility that attracts me to this group. Fudging that in the interest of
public relations seems to be going too far. Lets face it, radical ideas are
scary.

<p>
 I just read Max's latest Extropian Principles, and  think he has done a nice
job of expressing a radical belief without being too agressive about it. If that
is too much for people, they are likely not ready to hear the message yet.
