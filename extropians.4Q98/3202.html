You obviously don't know jack about business or economics. Customers who buy larger
quantities reduce the costs of the supplier because the supplier only has to service
one customer for that large quantity, rather than several, or hundreds, or even
thousands. In the case of industry using electricity, its because the utility only has
to maintain one high power line directly to the plant using the power. It does not
need to invest in a huge distribution to deliver that amount of power to thousands of
homes, so the business does not need to pay for the marginal cost of that distribution
network, just its own single line. Moreover, a large fraction of American industry
produces surplus power that they sell back to the utilities. Plants which use a lot of
steam will set up cogeneration systems to supply themselves with power off of the
steam plant and will sell the surplus to the utility. This dual use saves lots of
money for both the business and the utility, which allows the utility to keep YOUR
electricity rates down. Now, who is subisdizing who?
