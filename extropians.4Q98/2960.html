<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You're not getting the message... If a service is so indispensable, why do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we have to be forced to support it???</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Joe:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Sometimes we are not individually able to support it; then we simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;die.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Only if we remain isolated instead of associating with others to meet our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; common needs (or we're not permitted to peacefully associate). This doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessitate violence against anyone, merely voluntary cooperation. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; want something, but you can't (or don't wish to) persuade me to help, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't bestow on you a right to coerce me.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; How could the Central Americans reover from the hurricane without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; global gov't-coordinated assistance?  None of them are in any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; position to help each other (at least not enough).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll take this one. What you don't know about the recovery effort is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; overwhelming majority of assistance is NOT from other governments, but from</i><br>
<i>&gt; private corporations, mainly in the US, and from private citizens. I personally</i><br>
<i>&gt; know three people who just got on a plane and went down there to volunteer in</i><br>
<i>&gt; hospitals, and all of their freinds up here are putting together large support</i><br>
<i>&gt; packages. Another freind of mine just got back from Africa where he was doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; hospital work for several weeks (he's an anasthesiologist). Whenever there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; disaster here in the US, outside of government payouts to businesses and private</i><br>
<i>&gt; insurance payouts, the relief support is almost entirely funded by private groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; and businesses. Several home manufacturers have donated literally thousands of</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufactured homes to various hurricane victims in the South.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You really need to do your research before you spout off like that.</i><br>

If there are millions homeless in Honduras, as has been reported, 
mathematics entails that only one in hundreds has been housed by 
such an effort, laudable as it may<a name="2971qlink1"> be.  I watched an ABC special 
about a villager who spent an entire day digging down through the 
mud to the front of his former home just to salvage his door.</a>  That 
way, he would have one if he were ever able to build a home again.

there.        Joe
