<i>&gt; &gt; Hmm. Some have said that nanotech is inevitable, Feynman for one. (Or at</i><br>

<i>&gt; a major economic collapse, liquid nitrogen could stop being available</i><br>

<i>&gt; even "true cryonicists" would probably not elect premature freezing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There was a court case in the 1980s in which Thomas Donaldson, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; was suffering from a brain tumor, sued to establish his right to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; himself frozen before death.  The concern was that if he waited until</i><br>
<i>&gt; the tumor killed him, his brain would be destroyed and there would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing of value to freeze.  Donaldson lost his case, and there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal right to have yourself frozen before death in the United States,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as far as I know.  Fortunately Donaldson's health has remained good,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the tumor is apparently under control for now.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
 It was Donaldson that was on Phil Donnahue Right?

<p>
   I have wondered what had happened in his case.  I always thought I would
committed suicide somehow.  Because I know my insurance would still pay off...
if I have had it for over two years. But would Alcor be able to freezes a
suicide victim?... (suicide corps?) i.e. autopsy etc...

<p>
Any thoughts...?
