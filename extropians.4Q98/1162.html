<p>
I don't think "skeptic" is an inappropriate label for Whitesides.
My concern is the dismissal of feasibility by many in the
scientific community inhibits research and funding in areas
that might directly contribute to molecular assemblers and 
replicators. I don't fault Whitesides for being skeptical but 
instead of implying Drexler's visions are "science fiction".

<p>
Whitesides obviously sees potential for nanotechnology but 
seems to believe there is a definite ceiling to its potential.
Whitesides specifically refers to Drexler after his "science
fiction" remark. Equating a scientist's work with science
fiction is fairly contemptuous.

<p>
This is symptomatic of many scientists views of nanotechnology.
Michio Kaku, in his book _Visions_, casts Drexler's notions
aside with a rhetorical paragraph and then uses the polemic
comments of the editor of a science fiction publication and
another individual to berate Drexler's view of nanotechnology.
I find this situation absurd.
