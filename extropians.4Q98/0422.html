<a name="0428qlink3">Suppose we wait until the future happens (so to speak!), and someone
invents a time machine that allows travel into the past.  I gather that
you think that is at least logically possible.</a>

<a name="0428qlink4">Now we travel into the past, back to good old 1998, and here we meet
Brian D Williams.  We introduce ourselves to him and say that we are
from the future and that we've come back in a time machine to visit him.</a>

<p>
<a name="0428qlink5">He says that is impossible, because the future hasn't happened yet, and
shows us his message which he had just sent off to the extropians list.</a>

<p>
<a name="0428qlink6">Obviously he is wrong in some sense, because he concluded that time
travel was impossible, yet it was possible, and we are there.  What is
wrong with his argument?
