it was just north of methuen i think is the name of the place.  i was doing
business with a company called physical sciences inc.  i had a few hours
of daylight to kill before the meetings so i drove around looking for
something to do.  there were lots of nice houses, nice rural neighborhoods,
everything was very nice.  and i nearly lost my mind.  because it didnt
seem to be... forward looking.  i dont get out nearly enough i guess.
around here, everything is so tomorrow oriented.  its easy to be forward
looking since we dont really have a past... {8^</a>D

<a name="3128qlink2">this is not always good.  when visitors come, i like to use the old gag
"some of these buildings are over *twenty years old*... with an awed
tone.  {8^D but the down side is that a development company decided to
tear down the lab where william shockley invented the integrated
circuit.  i figure if i get frozen, then melted a couple hundred years
in the future, i will be looking up at a circle of faces all asking me:</a>

<p>
how could you!  let them tear down something so pivital to history?
why didnt you chain yourself to that building?  etc.  spike
