Zeb, I wasn't offering "watch out" as a *solution*. You can only look for
solutions once you're fully aware of the problem... I'm with you in that we
should focus on circumventing the unjust restrictions that are practically
inevitable. Building a global network of Extropians/transhumanists should
help in this.

<p>
At the same time, I am unwilling to give up on rational persuasion. Just
look at the Renaissance and the Enlightenment to see that large numbers of
people (especially those with influence) *can* make drastic changes in
their beliefs and the resulting values, social institutions, and laws.
Let's not give up on appealing to human reason. *Sometimes* it works!

<p>
<a name="0548qlink1">My preference is for a dual approach: Keep engaging people in rational
discussion, while networking to find and develop avenues for circumventing
national laws against transhuman technologies.</a>

<p>
One reason for optimism: The technologies that we want to apply to
extending lifespan, augmenting intellect, improving personality, etc., will
be developed in many countries for other purposes for which there is strong
demand. Once the tools are widely available, it will be much easier to use
them for our purposes. In isolated countries where computers,
biotechnology, and so on, are not allowed for *any* purpose, any
transhumanists will have a much harder time. Pehaps we will eventually
organize to help them escape from such backward places.

<p>
Onward!
