<p>
scott, i certainly agree that an episode of depression saps ones mental
energy.  during my investigation, that was the *only* thing i could
do.  i was in a physics seminar, watching a video tape of carl sagan's
excellent "cosmos" series.  i was enjoying the show, life was good,
etc, then suddenly: that short blurb about evolution.  it may serve as
a sad commentary on the condition of the u.s. education system</a> that i managed
<a name="0167qlink2">to go thru 14 years of it, including 2 biology classes, and had *never*
heard, there or elsewhere, a decent explanation of the theory of
evolution.  sagans five minute presentation hit me like a bolt of lightning
on a clear day.

<p>
ignoring my engineering studies, i immersed myself in the task</a> of investigating

<p>
<a name="0167qlink3">the idea.  i made a poor showing on the finals two weeks later, but the
real problem started the next quarter.  i was so focussed on that issue,
i found myself unable to study, unable to maintain normal human relations,
unable do *one damn thing* other than investigate evolution</a> and it
implications.
<br>
(i blush to admit this, but i have gone on at length about openness, so...)
i failed *all* my classes, every one.  i nearly had to drop out of school.
that
<br>
quarter, i dont think i ever opened an engineering book, and im almost
certain i failed to turn in a single homework assignment.  my friends thought
i was on drugs, my significant other thought i must be seeing someone else,
strangers thought i must be dissipating violently in masturbation and daytime
tv,
<br>
(innocent on all counts), teachers noticed my mind was waaay elsewhere
(guilty).

<p>
but, i solved it.  life on earth evolved.  humans evolved.  religion evolved.
the only other idea that hit me with anything like as much impact is...
nanotechnology.  but thats another story.   i wonder if drexler realizes
he is being mentioned in the same sentence with charles darwin.  {8^D spike
