  I started taking aerobics classes with middle-age clerical workers at my
first job, and could not keep up.  Now I am frustrated that in the Boston 
aerobics competition I didn't make it past semi-finals (well, it was the first
time I competed), my cardiovascular fitness test gives me 10 points above
my trainer, etc.  Feels a bit weird, I am definitely dramatically better physically
than I ever was in my youth.  Funny, it creates more problems with the
mundanes.  My landlady seemed to like me a lot more when I was slow and
depressed.  No surprises then.  An energetic guy looks much more suspicious.

<p>
The exercise is a bit hard to stop though.  I know I can't keep doubling my
bench press every year, but I don't really need to either.   And yet, the goal
of maintenance doesn't seem to be as exciting as rapid progress.  Sure, I
still can't do many things, like my push-up in a hand stand still doesn't quite
work, or I could always be a bit stronger and faster - but I'm not trying to 
turn myself into a professional athlete, and yes, I know it's a bit too late.
