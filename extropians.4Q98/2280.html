Let me guess: Ummm... he had a Jewish father, who had heavily invested in

<p>
"ignorant intolerance" can call itself whatever it likes. Sometimes it calls
itself judeo christian, sometimes buddhist, sometimes communist, sometimes
libertarian, sometimes national socialist, sometimes taoist, feminist,
humanist, socialist, hinduist, or any ist you want to list.

<p>
I don't think we (tolerant, sensible, mature, rational, compassionate, sexy,
intelligent, well-intended, honest, responsible, good-humored people) have
much to fear from *ignorant* intolerance. OTOH, the *knowledgeable*
intolerance of political lunatics and religious fanatics can present a
difficult situation, as it regularly opposes reasonable science. I regret
that science offends some people. But I don't think that scientists owe an
apology to anyone.

<p>
Ideologues, theologues, and demagogues oppose reason and fear science
because if reasonable scientists ruled, we could forget all about ideology,
theology, and demagogy.

PS: I consider myself a student/scientist specializing in "psychonomy" -- a
word I made up to signify the study of cognition beyond the myth of the
mind. Psychonomy relates to psychology as astronomy does to astrology.
Extropy plays an extremely vital part in this new field of science (or
pseudo-science, if you feel intolerant), because extropy operates beyond the
mind myth, and therefore merits careful and thorough study by extropic
psychonomers.
