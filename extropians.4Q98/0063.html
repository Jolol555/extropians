  IAN: I didn't misquote you. I guess you mean 
  to say that I did not address what you said, 
  but I did... My point was that suffering elimination
   can occur and modalities offered by 
<br>
  spiritual traditions such as yoga, meditation, 
  and psychological analysis do work and are not 
  pseudoscientific per se. Those are the remedies 
  for suffering offered by Buddhism and I cannot 
  think what else you may have been referring 
  to in Buddhism as being pseudoscientific 
  methodologies for overcoming suffering.

<p>
  What is the "spirituality" of Buddhism 
  but the beliefs and practices of Buddhism? 

<p>
  Heck, even believing in phoney Gods may overcome 
  suffering and also not be pseudoscientific in that 
  belief has real physiological effects on the mind.
