Gee, so you mean it wasn't "global capitalism" that caused</a> the problems after

Cool, I'm just going to stop paying taxes then. No worries that those armed

Nonsense. You're claiming that businesses commit worse atrocities than

tried to starve the kids in order to make the parents surrender, and then
burnt it down. I think you'll have a hard time coming up with an example.</a>

Oh, how awful. I "care" so much for those who refuse to take control of
their lives and prefer to let others do it for them.

If they choose a life of subservience, they can't complain about being
