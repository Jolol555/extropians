<p>
	While I like spirited, informative, insightful political
debates as much as anyone else, I dare say most of the recent
socialism (and death penalty and education function) posts have been
rather uninformative and uninsightful.

<p>
	There are several good, basic libertarian or free market texts
out there.  I encourage newcomers and dissenters to first read one of
these books and familiarize yourself with at least rudimentary terms
such as "coercion" or basic phenomenon such as the laws of supply and
demand.

<p>
Also, it would help if some analysis was done.  For example:

<p>
	The death penalty is a more interesting (less tired) thread,
but over the years, I still think, "The most notable thing about the
death penalty is how so much emotion and thought is expended over so
little."  How many people does the US execute every year anyway?  As
of Thursday 12/10, there has been a total of 64 US prisoners executed
in 1998:

<p>
[ See <a href="http://www.smu.edu/~deathpen/exec98.html">http://www.smu.edu/~deathpen/exec98.html</a> ]

<p>
	In 1998, there were probably more email posts to the Extropian
list over the death penalty than there were executions.

<p>
	There are 267,000,000+ people in the US.  Now let's look at
the most recent crime figures:

<i>&gt;---The 1997 Crime Index total of approximately 13.2 million offenses</i><br>

<i>&gt;comparisons show the 1997 national total has dropped 7 percent since</i><br>
<i>&gt;1993 and is 5 percent lower than in 1988.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Violent Crime</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;---The number of murders in 1997 was estimated at 18,209, which is 7</i><br>

<i>&gt;percent lower than the 1996 total and 26 percent lower than in</i><br>
<i>&gt;1993. The murder rate was 6.8 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants, the</i><br>

<i>&gt;total.</i><br>

<p>
ANALYSIS

<p>
	In '97, there were 74 executions.  18,209 / 74 = 246.07 -- the
1997 murder-to-executions ratio.

<p>
	74 executions (in '98 as of 12/10) versus 18,209 murders (in
'97) versus 96,122 rapes versus 1.6 million violent crimes.

<p>
<a name="2592qlink1">	Why, 1.6 million divided by 260 million comes to 1 in 160 --
the average US risk of being a victim of violent crime in 1997.  Using
the 1 in 160 figure, over the next 50 years, one has a 27% chance of
being a victim of a violent crime.  (Curiously, there are 535
</a>
congressbeings and senators in the US Congress; a member of the House
of Representatives was mugged in DC just a few weeks ago.)

<p>
CONCLUSION

<p>
	Similar analyses can be done on issues like socialism (the
negative correlation between tax burden and unemployment rates in the
G7 countries) and education (US spends more per pupil than any country
except Switzerland, yet in a recent test, US kids ranked 18th out of
21 major nations in competency tests).

<p>
	Please, if you must debate, a little research (i.e., a little
Altavista, a little reading) can go a long way.
