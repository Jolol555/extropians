<a href="3263.html#3302qlink1">&gt; And why on earth would we have to eliminate the "unfree" world (which by</a><br>
<i>&gt; some people's definitions would include virtually everyone)?  How could</i><br>
<i>&gt; they use HDTV against us?  How am I threatened if Saddam Hussein is able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to broadcast on HDTV?  It would be just another foreign language channel</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the cable system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't been able to follow any of Ken's reasoning.</i><br>

<p>
Your right, Hal.  My reasoning has been flawed lately.  I'm short on 
cash, and haven't had my normal maintenance dosages of Seratonin and 
Dopamine reuptake inhibitors.  This increases my aggression and 
depression, oddly enough.

<p>
When I was working in California at SGI, I had health insurance and 
good medical coverage.  But, now I'm up in Seattle, unemployed, and 
lacking the funds necessary to treat my genetically inherited mental 
illness (depression).  Now I have to try to find a doctor who will 
renew my prescriptions for free, between calls to my creditors to 
accept my minimum payments without destroying my perfect credit 
rating, which I had hoped to preserve in order to purchase a home.

<p>
I was quite happy on the following daily dosages:

<pre>
   Wellbutrin 150mg SR (2 x per day)
   Prozac      20mg    (1 x per day)
   Skunkweed via Bong  (5 x per day)

</pre>
<p>
Now I'm trapped in Seattle, and not eligible to work at the area's 
primary employer, simply because I missed my first day of work at 
Microsoft, due to my grief over my uncle Mark's death and inability 
to afford Cryonics insurance.

I wouldn't be broke right now if UPS had some sort of wireless check 
verification scheme, that would prevent things like my being robbed 
of $2910 because UPS accepted a bad cashier's check that some WATTS 
L.A. gang member created using Quicken and an HP Laserjet printer.

<p>
See <a href="http://define.com/paperwork/bogus-check.jpg">http://define.com/paperwork/bogus-check.jpg</a>

<p>
I would think that UPS (<a href="http://www.ups.com/">http://www.ups.com/</a>) and FedEx 
(<a href="http://www.fedex.com">http://www.fedex.com</a>) could get together with AT&amp;T Wireless or 
USWEST PCS and Qualcomm to come up with a check verification system!

Anyway, now I'm depressed and thinking about all the shitty ways 
Teledesic (<a href="http://www.teledesic.com/">http://www.teledesic.com/</a>) could be used as a directed 
energy weapon to vaporize people who clone Microsoft Windows.  I know 
they're working closely with Boeing, and Boeing knows all about such 
things.

<p>
What kind of satellite surveillance do you need to track the x,y,z 
coordinates of all the human NACs on earth? 

<p>

<p>
We could build a database of the exact position of every nucleus 
accumbens (maybe in North Korea or Iraq), and do a large scale test 
of Bill Otto's fast steering mirrors in great big laser show!

Sorry... I'm getting violent thoughts again.  Must be due to that low 
dopamine and seratonin level.  It would be so terrible to see the 
loss of millions of lives in a new millenium Holocaust, just because 
one guy with an internet account could get his presriptions for a few 
milligrams of antidepressants!

<p>
Maybe we could hurry up and eliminate the Gold Standard!

<p>
The International Monetary Fund (<a href="http://www.imf.org/">http://www.imf.org/</a>) could switch 
over to the Riegel Economic System so people like my recently expired 
uncle Mark Howard Riegel <a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco5.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco5.htm</a> could 
get an allowance of .111 per minute 24x7 for the indignity of being 
tracked (Mark of the Beast style cattle ranching).

<p>
That would come out to $58,341.60 per year.  I think even my father, 
at 111 Mizar Place in Lompoc, CA, would be able to survive on this!
