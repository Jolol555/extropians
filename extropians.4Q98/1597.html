<i>&gt; den otter, are you sure that you *really want* women to act like men? </i><br>

<p>
Only in certain aspects. Of course I don't want them to turn into 
braindead, beer-swilling brutes with a fascination for sports involving 
a ball. Rather, I'd like women to become more mentally (and physically
-- death to anorexia!) empowered; self-confident and non-submissive. 
At the same time, excess aggression in males would have to be curbed 
(again by hormone treatments etc.) so that the sexes meet somewhere 
in the middle. A (mentally) more androgyne society would be more
pleasant for everyone.

<p>
Well, 'nuff said...
