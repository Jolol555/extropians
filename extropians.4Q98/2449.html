Ok, I've had this idea kicking around in my mind for awhile, and I want to
see what some people with knowledge in the area think about it.

<p>
Anyway, last year, in my senior year in high school, I did a presentation on
time travel (in my English class, strangely enough) and since then I've been
formulating an idea that ties religion and science together in an
interesting way. I can't claim that it's new, but I've never heard about it
anywhere that I can remember.

<p>
<a name="2548qlink1"><a name="2453qlink1">Supposing somewhere far in the future humanity (or possibly even some other
intelligent life form) develops time travel.</a> After all, the universe is
going to be around a LONG time, so if it's possible, it's probable. Now,
assuming that our current assumptions about the nature of time are correct
(that we do not live in a "multiverse" of multiple, different outcomes for
each probability, but rather there is a definite relationship of one event
leading to another) they could not travel to the past, because such a thing
would alter their own reality, including them, causing paradox.

<p>
They might, however, be able to upload personalities into a computer at the
moment of death, thusly not changing anything in that reality. After all,
once a person's dead, their consciousness can't interact with anything.

<p>
To a person living now, this future would be akin to heaven. They would be
with everyone they ever knew, and, as the cliched thought goes, who the hell
</a>
<a name="2548qlink2">knows what "they" will think of a thousand years from now?

<p>
Furthermore, might it be a viable alternative to cryonics, especially once
we have created self-evolving AI technology?</a>

<p>
<a name="2548qlink3">Just an idea....
