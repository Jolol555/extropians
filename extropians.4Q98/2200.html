A few years ago I spent some time with the people who were camped out on
the proposed site of a new highway in England; these people were living
in fields, supported by my taxes, and I've never seen as many cell phones
as I did in that time.

<a name="2217qlink1">Back on the education front, I think at least half the problem is with
the modern idea of "an education" that lasts a few years early in life
and that's that. Almost nothing I need to know on an everyday basis
even existed when I was at school, and almost nothing I learnt at school
is at all useful to me. The time I spent there was almost entirely wasted,
and cost the tax-payers of the time a huge amount of money. It's not just
education funding that we have to change, it's the entire educational
philosophy.
