<a name="2218qlink1"><a href="2175.html#2190qlink1">&gt;My only question to those who simultaneously believe in many worlds, while</a><br>
also believing
<br>
<a href="2175.html#2190qlink2">&gt;in conservation of mass and energy: Where does all of the mass and energy</a><br>
come from?

<p>
It comes from anti-matter's reflection, like an echo from another time-space
continuum.</a>

<p>
<a name="2218qlink2"><a href="2175.html#2190qlink3">&gt;Where is the mass and</a><br>
<i>&gt;energy for these universes coming from?</i><br>

<p>
The circular nature of reality makes it possible for mass and energy to
enter a black hole and come out as a new universe. Why is there anything
rather than nothing? Because without anything to ask, the question does not
exist. Inertia occurs in brains as well as in inert matter.</a>

<p>
<a name="2218qlink3">That there is no apparent source for this, then
<br>
<a href="2175.html#2190qlink4">&gt;either conservation is maintained and Many Worlds is bunk, or it isn't and</a><br>
there should
<br>
<a href="2175.html#2190qlink5">&gt;be measurable phenomena which we can observe which show where the mass and</a><br>
energy is
<br>
<a href="2175.html#2190qlink6">&gt;coming from outside the universe or out of the zero point field (in which</a><br>
case over-unity
<br>
<a href="2175.html#2190qlink7">&gt;energy sources should be possible). Many Worlds is nice and fanciful, and I</a><br>
like it
<br>
<a href="2175.html#2190qlink8">&gt;myself, but that doesn't make it true.</a><br>

<p>
Okay, so it comes down to what you like most: your present concept of the
universe or one that includes more possibilities.
