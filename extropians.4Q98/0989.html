From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;


<p>
<a href="0983.html#0989qlink1">&gt;Nah, we've just gotten a lot more subscribers from Europe, New Zealand and</a><br>
<i>&gt;Australia. Consequently, the number of people with socialist leanings has</i><br>
<i>&gt;gone up. They seem to have this quirky notion that you can make everything</i><br>
<a name="0999qlink1"><i>&gt;equal for everyone without stealing anything from anybody, or annoying</i><br>
</a>anyone


<p>
<a name="1010qlink1">First of I must say that I find death to be the ultimate form</a> of loss of
freedom.

<p>
In my POW there is a scale of freedom that goes like this:

<p>
Absolute Freedom -&gt; Wealth -&gt; middle class wealth -&gt; annoying lack of
money -&gt;
<br>
Powerty -&gt; inability to feed one self properly -&gt; No food at all -&gt; Death

<p>
<a name="1010qlink2">I think that being poor is the ultimate form of imprissonment there is. Just
slightly better than death.</a>

<p>
<a name="1084qlink1"><a name="1010qlink3"><a name="1002qlink1">Therefore I find it is fair to steal money from those who has "wealth"</a> and
"middle class wealth" to help those who has "powerty" or less.
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="0999qlink2">"Making the rich 2% unhappier to make the poor 200% happier"</a>

<p>
When that is done I also believe that ultimately those people should be able
to feed themself. Therefore I find it to be a good idea to steal even more
money from the more wealthy, to give the poor a free education. Then they
will become a productive part of society and there will be an ROI that will
benefit all of the society.

<p>
The educated mind is the greatest raw material there is.

<p>
Economics is a win win scenario,<a name="0999qlink3"> and taking money away from the wealthy and
investing them in other peoples education/helping the poor can eventually
make the wealthier even wealthier</a> as society as a whole becomes wealthier
and the newly rich start spending their money.

<p>
I think this is obvious from watching history. I would rather be poor and
unemployed today in Denmark than I would want to be King Richard of England
:-)

<p>
<a name="1010qlink5">And no. I don't believe that the individual investor and the invisible hand
will automatically find a similar solution. At least not without the
consquences being to big for the poor.</a>

<p>
<a name="1010qlink6">Another thing though is the level of taxation taking place now, which I find
has reached absurd proportions. At least here in Denmark. I currently pay at
least 65% of my total income to different taxes! This I do find rather
enslaving.</a>


<p>
<a name="0999qlink4">btw. I am considdered to be right wing here in Denmark</a> :-)
