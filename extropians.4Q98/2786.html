Well now that explains a few things about you!  Yes, it is hard for
older students to start an academia career, but if they succeed I think
they bring with them valuable perspective and spunk.<a name="2861qlink1">  Older students 
<a name="2876qlink1">seem less likely to mold themselves to fit the standard personality and
style of their discipline,</a> and seem less likely to internalize the 
discipline's ideas of what the interesting questions are.  While these
are seen as negatives in junior people, they become "creativity" and 
other positives in more senior people.</a>
