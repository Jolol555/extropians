um, not really.  its unclear exactly where the gps signals can be reacquired, but
the theory suggests it is in the last 3 to 5 seconds of flight, depending on the
trajectory.  i may be able to dig up the equations for it if you are that interested.
the notion was to make a reentry body that would do the dirty work not with
explosives but by sheer kinetic energy.  a body travelling at around 1100 meters
per second would release the energy of an equivalent mass of exploding
tnt.  such a system might be great for taking out a communications tower
or a radar dish, but it is your classic american weapon, as it would cost a
looooot of money.  spike
