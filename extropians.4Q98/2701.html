you haven't seen the smallest part of it.

As many may know ....I'm a trucker.  I haul mostly equipment.  Farm equipment.
Right now I have on a Combine and a tractor.  A moderately large combine.
It's twelve foot wide WITHOUT the "header".

<p>
California is one of my primary delivery points.  I've been all thru it.  It's
primary claim to fame is multiple growing seasons.  NOT the size of it's
fields.  Kansas...now Kansas has some large fields.  As do all the other
plains states.  Miles on a side. The misnamed "midwest" has really nice farm
land too.

<p>
The problem the farmers are having vis a vis the price paid for crops is (as
is true of  almost every problem) due to government meddling in the economy.
The supply and demand feedback loops have been diddled and the indicators are
screwy.  Hence malinvestment.

<p>
Hate to tell you guys...but farm Mechanization is pretty well established.
It's a billion dollar (at least) industry.  I know some farmers who
synchronize planting, tillage,fertilizing  and harvesting with GPS and
databases...

<p>
The problem had been pattern recognition.  How to determine a weed or a pest
or a product..  Now with microprocessors and advanced software I foresee the
day when there will no longer be a need for stoop labor.
