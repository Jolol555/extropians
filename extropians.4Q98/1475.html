hey, it worked in this country.  well sort of.  as kathryn points out, this
is a very difficult problem, however i have tremendous confidence in
the power of human desire for material goods to overcome religious
blindness and ignorance.  in the war between materialism vs faith, im
betting on the former.

a test case to watch: israel, 400 days from now.  new years eve, 1999,
happens to fall on a sabbath.  the religious leaders will want the entire
country shut down as usual on a friday evening, whereas the more secular,
bar owners and such, will want to stay open, collect sheckels from the
party crowd, and generally join the rest of the world in revelry.  so, these
two speeding freight trains are approaching each other with grim determination.
who do you bet on to run over the other?  will this be the first shot in an
israeli culture war?  spike
