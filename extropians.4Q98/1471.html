Kris Ganjam, &lt;krisgan@microsoft.com&gt;, forwards a review of Ray Kurzweil's
new book, The Age of Spiritual Machines:
<br>
<i>&gt; [An interview with Kurzweil by Forbes magazine:]</i><br>
<a href="1452.html#1471qlink1">&gt; Your book gets pretty weird: People scan their brains into a computer and</a><br>
<i>&gt; create self-replicas. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By 2040 it will be routine. If you build a computer based on the design of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the human brain and instantiate information from a human being onto that</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer, it will emerge in the machine and claim to be that person. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine will say, "I grew up in Brooklyn, I went to MIT, then I walked</i><br>
<i>&gt; into a scanner and woke up here in the machine." </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; These are going to be very smart entities--much smarter than humans. And</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's really where power lies. Ultimately these entities will have</i><br>
<i>&gt; political power. They will have all the political power. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is good news? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some people who've read the book have come away feeling depressed. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; get the idea that human beings are ending, that civilization is ending.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually we will continue, but in a much more profound way. The human race</i><br>
<i>&gt; is going to evolve. We are going to become smarter by merging with our</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines. </i><br>

<p>
This sounds very similar to Hans Moravec.  It's amazing to see these
ideas beginning to enter the mainstream.

<p>
<a name="1477qlink1">Moravec's new book arrived from Amazon yesterday, but my son grabbed it
as soon as he got home from school so I haven't started it yet.</a>  I'll
take a look at it this weekend.
