For me it was about the same age, though not so strictly religiously
oriented.  I was standing outside watching some sprinklers water the lawn
when I saw a rainbow out in the mist.  Remembering that there was supposed
to be a pot of gold hidden at the end of the rainbow, I noticed that this
one was small enough that I could check both ends without breaking a sweat.
 :)

<p>
Unfortunately, by the time I had gotten there, the sprinklers had
automatically shut off.  Frustrated by this, I nonetheless figured out how
to make a rainbow with the hose in our backyard.  Yet the rainbow was
suspended in midair: it never touched the ground, so there was no pot of
gold.  Yet I also noticed that when I moved the hose, I saw "different
parts" of the rainbow, like illuminating an object with water which
otherwise remained hidden.  Following the path, my "aha" experience was
when I saw that the rainbow I was observing was no bigger than 3 feet
across: a circle suspended in midair.  There was no end, and no pot of gold.

<p>
"They've all been tricked!" I thought to myself.  "There is no pot of gold!
 What's more, I can make rainbows in my own backyard!"

<p>
Elated, I tried to explain this to my parents, to no avail.  :)
