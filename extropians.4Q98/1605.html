<p>
Absolutely right!
<br>
I'm at the point where I really don't care how we get some permanent hardware up
as long as it's up.
<br>
the government is obviously not the best choice for the project, but if they're
doing it I'll hang my hat there if I can.

You're right that the project is not very extropian in how it's being
accomplished, but I certainly let out a whoop of excitement this morning when
I saw that the Zarya module had gotten off the pad at Baikanour OK.  Although
ISS is a big boondoggle in many ways and it's history is an object lesson in
why big central government projects are about the least efficient means of
accomplishing anything (even something as single-minded as "build a space
station"), it's also a great source of education for the next generation of
space engineers.  We'll need those people when the technology becomes
available to do space on a more efficient basis.  I'd like to see ISS
privatized as soon as possible and serve as a construction base for those
projects.  By then (2005-2015) it's scientific value will have gone from low
to nil, but its value as a place to do useful engineering work may be
unmatched.
