<p>
Because<a name="2837qlink1"> I believe that capitalism is as silly as any other method of
organising a system (yes, I know, capitalism is in some ways not a way of
organising a system).</a>

<p>
<a name="2837qlink2">I care about people and I believe that in certain situations that people
ought to be helped.</a>  I don't believe in public funds going towards art,
theatre, etc.  I do believe that when it comes to technology and most forms
of commerce the capitalist system is the best.  And in general capitalism
will give everyone a better tomorrow.<a name="2837qlink3">  But looking around I can see hundreds
of thousands of people starving to death when we have the technology</a> to feed
<a name="2837qlink4">the world and educate them all to university standard for a tiny</a> fraction of
<a name="2837qlink5">the amount we spend on arms each year.</a>

<p>
<a name="2837qlink6">So yes, in a perfect world where Capitalism worked instnataneously to
equalise differences[1], I'd be happy to leave it to it's own devices, but
otherwise I think that I'd prefer the singularity to arrive 10 years later
with a load more happy well fed people than arrive ten years earlier with
hundreds of thousands of people dying of easily prevented diseases.</a>

<p>
<a name="2837qlink7">[1]  A company moves into a very poor country and employs it's</a> people doing
<a name="2837qlink8">horrible jobs for a pittance.</a> Eventually more companies move in, they have
<a name="2837qlink9">to compete for labour, wages rise, quality of life rises, education rises
and the companies have to find someone else to make trainers.  Great - in
the long run.  In the short run I'd rather that we were</a> sponsoring education
<a name="2837qlink10">in these countries and making people happy now.  Even if it did mean</a> you had
<a name="2837qlink11">to pay an extra $5 for your trainers and they were made in Ohio.
