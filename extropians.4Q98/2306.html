&gt; I think the operative gibberish phrase is "for use in our further
&gt; evolution."  Since evolution is in response to preexisting actual
&gt; environments, not in anticipation of future possible surroundings
&gt; (and indeed can only be this way if its mechanism is indeed natural
&gt; selection), the above phrase is so full of fuzzyminded b.s. that no
&gt; respectable bovine would defecate it.

Although this is a complete diversion from my intended line of thought,
I'd have to agree with you on this one!  Besides, I'm not here to debate RAW's
outdated, yet remarkably suggestive prose from 1977.  I am however using Tim Leary's
8-circuit model as a launching pad for thinking about what higher intelligence could
be.  I think now is as good a time as any to take Tim Leary's 8-circuit model and
give it a more updated precise scientific re-working.  In fact, Tim Leary was quite
eager to see such a scientific revision done by those knowledgeable enough to take
on the task.

<p>
Getting back to my original point, I think that being a so-called slave to an
immensely higher intelligence might ironically be more free than being a slave now
to our inherited genetic, neurological and sociological constraints.  Any thoughts
in that regard?
