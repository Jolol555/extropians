For myself, the memes I absorbed from SCI-fi contributed to a mind-set =
that
<br>
made it almost impossible to talk to _most_ other about thing that =
seemed to
<br>
me to really matter, no common language.
I think those memes are much more widely spread now than in the past =
but
<br>
there's an aura of 'fairy tale' to them that keeps most people from =
actually
<br>
thinking about them.
<br>
Certainly even with the computer revolution as a yardstick most are
unwilling to recognize that _many_ (if not all) of the fundamentals of =
life
<br>
are on the same fast track of change.
<br>
I'm not sure we need to push Transhumanist memes as much as we need to
emphasize that things are changing _quickly_ and there's a need to be
informed and prepared.
<br>
If that gets across those that can adjust will (and decide what form =
that
<br>
adjustment will take _on their own_) and the rest, as always will =
muddle
<br>
along and maybe get sucked under (so sad).

<p>
Seems everybody everywhere has this problem.
=A0
<br>
Ever wonder why most people just don't seem to be able to relate to
transhumanist ideas. Could it be a lack of interest or lack of =
intellect? Is
<br>
there any way that we can do to change this sad state of affairs? I'm =
pretty
<br>
sure the world would be much better off for it.

For what it's worth I'm 50 and have had this problem all my life, at =
least
<br>
until I stumbled onto this list.=20
<br>
It was a major revolution to me that there was an organized(?) group =
