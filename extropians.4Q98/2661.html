 I didn't have that image in mind. True, top down organisation is crap
in every day life, but crisis might need some kind of chain in command,
some kind of government that would try to organise efforts towards one
goal.

<p>
   There is cooperation "inside" a capitalist organisation and with
suppliers, and competition with other organisation.... And on the long
term it seems like a good thing for the general economy, but what
happens in case of crisis? Who is in charge?</a>
