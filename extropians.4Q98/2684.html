When I was a kid, Australian schools were not big on IQ tests.  I suspect
my life might have been far different if we'd had them.  As a working class
kid sent at pocket-scraping expense to a low-grade middle class Jesuit
school, I was so dissonant with my peers that I was finally assumed to be a
mental defective and exiled to a slum technical school at 12.  I didn't do
any better among the thugs, oddly enough.  At around 14 or 15, the state
provided some kind of standardised IQ-cum-aptitude test for everyone.
There was a shocked flurry.  Instead of sending me dutifully to a factory,
my parents (who by then had another 5 kids and no more money) had the
dismal prospect of finding fees for a real school.<a name="2786qlink1">  I solved this sideways
by going into a seminary for a couple of years, before escaping to
university and a life of sin.  But the legacy of my totally fucked
schooling meant that I didn't get my PhD until I was in my forties, and
it's a bit late in the day to start a career as a professional philosopher
</a>
at that stage.  (But actually it might not be, if the anti-agathics arrive
in time.)  So I sympathise with Mike's reference to traumatic stress.
