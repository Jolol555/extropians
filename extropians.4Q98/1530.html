Hi Patrick and list,

<p>
<a href="1506.html#1530qlink1">&gt;Timothy:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No doubt you know the literature well in this area, but I don't see how the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Goldberg reference below shows any evidence for sex-based cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;differences caused by laterization.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1531qlink1">Goldberg is pretty explicit. He suggests that only men are lateralised on 
his task and has studied this in neuropsych populations. His idea is that 
the context-dependent left hemisphere/context-invariant  right hemisphere 
dichotomoy doesn't hold in grousp with two X chromosomes.</a>

<p>
Will let you all know how a (modest size) study I am doing on this turns 
out.

<p>
best wishes,
<br>
tim

It's a demonstration that you can't understand the philosophy of
the mind merely by virtue of being known as a philosopher of the mind.
