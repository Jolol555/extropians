Perhaps greater experience helps.  I have had a taste for the
unusual idea all my life but I think that over a decade in the 
"real world" gives me a better idea of when the usual doesn't
work (and when it does) and hence a better idea of when the
unusual is more promising (or less).  I also think I have a better
grip on what I can do and am more able to plot a path to 
accomplish an objective.
