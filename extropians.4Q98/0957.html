I have to disagree with your very first assumption about Mr. Gingrich - that he believes
in freedom - at least of the civil kind. His record clearly show that he does not look
kindly on civil liberties; and his ideas, futuristic though they may be, do not represent
progress in any measurable way I consider it.  I could be wrong, but I distinctly recall
that Mr Newt was on the side of those opposing any kind of cloning research.  On the
other hand,<a name="0991qlink1"> one of the few sane voices calling for rational inquiry into cloning was
Senator Harkin (D-Iowa), who by the way is a vocal fan of Star Trek and science fiction
in general.  He believes very strongly in space exploration, the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence, and advanced scientific and technological research.</a>

<p>
As to lumping together politicians, I draw the line on anybody who advocates the death
penalty for a victimless crime.  I don't care if he is on Extropy Institutes Board of
Directors or a research nanotechnologist.

<p>
As to the rest of your post, unique and fascinating as always. :-)
