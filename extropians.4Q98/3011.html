I'd like to boycott the monopoly corporation which makes me pay thousands of
dollars annually for next to no services outside of littering my newspaper and
tv programs with programming of dubious merit, inflating the cost of all the
other goods and services I use, and paying people of squirrely reputations to
not be able to move into my neighborhood, just so's I don't have to shoot them
when they come breaking in my door or window... Those cool pictures from the
Space Telescope and making sure those crazy foreigners will think twice before
messing with me are about the only things I find useful that the company does
for me.

<p>
Furthermore, this company does all sorts of things around the world in my name
that I don't like.

<p>
Now, I am boycotting Turner Broadcasting, since Ted Turner has imposed a policy
on CNN that they are not to feature the use of firearms in any positive light.
I urge all extropians who beleive in the right of self defense, or even in the
principle of balanced, objective media to do likewise. We can't get all of
them, but we have caught Ted in the act.

<p>
I would like to be able to both keep my job and boycott Microsoft products,
because Bill Gates donates money to gun control groups and campaigns, but thats
kind of a trade off I can't handle at this time.
