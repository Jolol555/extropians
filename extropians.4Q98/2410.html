Speaking of all major currencies and precious metals...

<p>
What if you had a scanner 3D capable of telling you the atomic number 
of any x,y,z coordinate.  Imagine you could scan the whole earth, and 
read the DNA of every living creature, as well as locate the physical 
location of all gold, platinum, silver, copper, and every other 
element?

<p>
If you were to use nanorobots to collect all the gold, platinum, 
silver, titanium, and copper, and to assemble them into pyramids, how 
large would each pyramid be?

<p>
Could the golden pyramid be placed somewhere in Mountain View, CA, 
without being so heavy as to cause the coast of California to crack 
along the San Andreas Fault, and sink into the Pacific Ocean?

P.S. I don't think Teledesic is going to fly.  Two-way QTT &amp; EMP used 
for copyright enforcement just isn't in the cards.

<a name="2428qlink1">Now that we know that GPS fits on chips (<a href="http://www.sirf.com/">http://www.sirf.com/</a>), how

<p>
How can a civilian organization build a transportation infrastructure 
that consists of computer navigated electric shuttles, when the 
<a name="2428qlink3">civilian chips are only accurate to 100 meters?  And why do we need 
</a>
our tax dollars going to tanks, planes, and cruise missiles when we 
have speed-of-light kill systems like THOR?  Maybe it's time to call 
some friends at the phone company and have them start making lists of 
home addresses for the senior executives at all military industrial 
complex defense contracts, just so that when the next boondoggle war 
</a>
starts, we can begin eye-for-an-eye deanimation of the dogs of war?
