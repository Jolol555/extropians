Easy Money  HOW TO TURN $6 INTO $6,000!! OR MUCH MORE!! READING THIS COULD
CHANGE YOUR LIFE! I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A
little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, 
and came across an article similar to this that said you
could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment
of $6.00! So I thought, "Yeah right, his must be a scam", but like most of
us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to
each  of the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then place your
own name and address in the bottom of the list  at #6, and post the article
in at least 200 newsgroups or bulk email it to everyone you know and to
any email address you can find. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So
after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about
trying it. I figured: "what have I got to lose except   stamps and $6.00,
right?" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7
days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would
end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about
$25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00!
In the third week I had
<br>
over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I
have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly.
It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the
lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it
works....Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can
get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you
follow the directions exactly,
<br>
that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing
something so easy! Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it
out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come
in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)
IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and
it is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all of the following
instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and 50,000 or more can
be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the
honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by
carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail
Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible,
it's a service. You
<br>
are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are
happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the
mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you
and me asking to be included in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to
success: STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on
each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00
bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will
not be seen through the envelope (to
<br>
prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal
them, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR ENVELOPES. You should
now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above
phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is
creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a
legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little
skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I
checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed
that it is indeed legal! Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:

<p>
#1) O. Oyesiku<br>
<br>
1210 Woodycrest Ave. #3a
<br>
Bronx,NY 10452
<br>
#2) D. Molkentin<br>
<br>
100 Kennedy Ave.
<br>
Blue Point, NY 11715
<br>
#3) M. McGuire<br>
<br>
68 Devon Lane
<br>
Williamsville, NY 14221
<br>
#4) Dr. E.<br>
<br>
6573 Maple Lakes Dr.
<br>
W. Bloomfield, MI 48034
<br>
#5) JC<br>
<br>
1908 Thurmond Place
<br>
Charlotte, NC 28205
<br>
#6) C. Edel	<br>
<br>
30028 W.12 Mile #33	
<br>
Farmington Hills, MI 48334

<p>
STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other
names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on
the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article
as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least
200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is
200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! ** EVERYBODY
AROUND THE WORLD CAN DO IT, BUT REMEMBER TO PUT ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR
EVELOPES!!!!** This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to
Title 18 Sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these
steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and
again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the
honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to
the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program
will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your
way. NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either
on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you.
This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a
good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail
theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully
followed,
<br>
six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer
with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that
when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of
dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the
first six people listedabove) Send
<br>
it now, add your own name to the list and you're in
business! ---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO
NEWSGROUPS------------ Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter
to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this
letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select
'copy'
<br>
from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's
memory. Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top
of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a
copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list.
Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If
you want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always have this
file to go back to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try
searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat
sites,
<br>
discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a
new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from
the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone
sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group,
click the post message button. You're done with
your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to
different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will
take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup!  **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS
YOU POST IN (Message-boards etc.) THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT
YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200 OR EMAIL TO A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE
That's it! You will begin receiving money
from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box
due to the large amount of mail you will
receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as
long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE
CORRECT.**
<br>
Now the WHY part: Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very
low example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now,
each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings,
each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original
5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts
with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional
$125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my
name at
<br>
#3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK,<br>
now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200
letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that
just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message
to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200
newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of
only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take
the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send
out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again.
And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that
thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading
these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $6.00
and see if it really works?? I think
<br>
so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you
the money? So what! What are the
<br>
chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new
honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are
willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new
users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet.
Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY
<br>
and this will really work. Don't let this exciting opportunity pass you by!:
How to turn $6 into $6,000! Or more!!!
