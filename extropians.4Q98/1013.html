Minnesota has not had a major party Governor for 12 years. Jesse was at the low
20's for percentages up until the debates. Hubert Humphrey III demanded that
Jesse be included in them because he thought that it would hurt his</a> opponent
more than he. Turns out Jesse did great in the debates and was the only one with
<a name="1017qlink2">some new exciting ideas, and could talk like a normal human being. It will be
interesting to see what develops of his administration.
