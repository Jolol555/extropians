Well, if we look at the animal kingdom as a living, intelligent 
being, then culling the human species would actually seem to be an 
intelligent "optimistic" conspiracy.

much better place without all the ivory hunters.  Better to get them 
inoculated with sterilizing/radioactive isotope tags/genetically 
engineered germs that spread over the cerebral cortex like two-way 
ipng slime/smallpox vaccine.

<p>
<i>&gt;From the perspective of grey whales and dolphins, it would be an </i><br>
optimistic conspiracy theory to think of a Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet linked up to a bunch of stealth blimp mounted high energy 
lasers, running down rows, watching all the whale hunters turned into 
puddles of boiling grease (not unlike Farmer John's bacon, in your 
local Denny's).

<p>
Which brings me to optimistic conspiracies from the perspective of 
slaughterhouse pigs, sheep, beef, and chickens.  They might prefer 
something less than instananeous: no oatmeal flakes, coffee grounds, 
puddles of blubber, piles of ashes, or puffs or steamy red mist.

<p>
They'd probably prefer to set the hack pattern plane vectors on 
something like finger joints, wrist joints, elbows, shoulders, with 
.5 second delays between each.  Then toes, ankles, knees, with .1 
seconds between each.

<p>
Have you ever been to a slaughterhouse?  Interesting spectral 
analysis could be performed on the cries from the soon to be Big Macs 
and Quarter Pounders w/cheese.  Moooo, bahhhhh, gobble gobble, 
gurgle, burp.  Let's go deep sea fishing?  See what we can catch with 
the Senator's head from the bait bucket?  Maybe a shark or a 
sailfish?

<p>
Which brings us to the humane society: would you prefer toxic gas, or 
green sleeping serum.  Cute pile of puppies in that there double ply 
Glad garbage bag: throw in a few kitty kitties for shitz and grins.  

<p>
Make them smarter, huh Mr. Lorrey?  What do you mean by *them*?  The 
animals on earth?  When the squirrels and chipmunks stop evolving 
noise-cancelling filters in their audio cortex systems that 
specifically match Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and General Electric 
turbofan noise pollution, then the human species might be worth 
saving.  Not to mention the Bambi meets Kenworth on the highway 
scene.

<p>
It's wonderful that we have all this broadband internet how to make 
lethal weapons in your kitchen material online.  It'll be fascinating 
to see what the machete-weilding tribesmen do with it, between 
intervillage massacres.  And all that CNN footage of burning cars in 
Jerusalem: both sides turned to sawdust is ok by me.  But, maybe 
that's just because I'm manic-depressive on a moody downward cycle 
for a day or two.  Fuck it.  Charge the flywheels and get Libya, 
Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Israel, and North Korea out of the way.

<p>
P.S. Dear Mossad C4 cellphone battery store, Seattle franchise: sorry 
about the Israel comment.  Be at peace, knowing the United 
Technologies and TRW are graciously receiving U.S. tax-dollars so 
you, too, will have your own West Bank T.H.E.L. Microsoft Excel state 
tables.
