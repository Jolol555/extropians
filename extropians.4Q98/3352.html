Abstract
<br>
  The treatment of ischemic strokes is limited to prophylactic
  agents that block the coagulation cascade. Here, we show that
  cholesterol-lowering agents, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase
  inhibitors, protect against cerebral injury by a previously unidentified
  mechanism involving the selective up-regulation of endothelial NO synthase
  (eNOS). Prophylactic treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors augments
  cerebral blood flow, reduces cerebral infarct size, and improves neurological
  function in normocholesterolemic mice. The up-regulation of eNOS by HMG-CoA
  reductase inhibitors is not associated with changes in serum cholesterol
  levels, but is reversed by cotreatment with L-mevalonate and by the
  downstream isoprenoid, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and not by farnesyl
  pyrophosphate. The blood flow and neuroprotective effects of HMG-CoA
  reductase inhibitors are completely absent in eNOS-deficient mice, indicating
  that enhanced eNOS activity by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is the
  predominant if not the only mechanism by which these agents protect against
  cerebral injury. Our results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
  provide a prophylactic treatment strategy for increasing blood flow and
  reducing brain injury during cerebral ischemia.
