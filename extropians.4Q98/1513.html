Err, you weren't listening. I said there is no need to rewrite
anything for the original rationale, and singnificantly beyond 
that bickering about quality of OSses becomes pointless. (And if 
only because in advanced architectures the distinction between 
code and data grows meaningless, and the art of programming 
becomes first a lot like chip design, then is reduced to providing 
a set of constraints and then goes extinct altogether, along with 
the bipedal primate).

I won't discuss MacOS, but with a GUI a la KDE (Next version of
TrollTech's Qt will be GPL, and then there is Gnome) and a streamlined
installation even a typical housewife might find Linux attractive. 
Beyond the marketing smoke and mirrors, even Microsoft is
very aware of that (see Halloween2).

<p>
As to Linux, it is far from being optimal. How are you supposed to 
build an affordable parallel system if your kernel alone takes up 
a MByte? You want fastest memory possible, you must use local on-die 
memory with kBit wide bus and no parasitic capacitance/inductance. 
Why having caches then? But die yield says your CPU must be way 
simpler (no pipeline/MMU/FPU/BPU etc.), and your core grains must 
be tiny. Linux/Unix is not scalable to a system of few 100 networked
CPUs with a few MBit of RAM each. If your core is very limited, and 
sending an (asynchronous active) message is almost as fast as 
acessing on-die core we are obviously concerned more with 
hierarchical decomposition of objects so that their fragments 
fit into memory grains than with page faults, swaps, process context 
switches, threads, libraries, modules, and other vermin. I guess I'll
never understand it why people think that building computers or
programming them are rational enterprises, and not ad hoc bricolage
following market conservativism and vogues. What's so rational in a
Hollerith machine and punching cards or pushing abacus beads?
