<p>
I didn't claim that. But the myth seems to claim that, and I disagree
with the myth. 

<p>
<a href="2653.html#2744qlink2">&gt; Being able to achieve higher highs, also means being more able to</a><br>
<i>&gt; enjoy simple things, such as watching a sunset or listening to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; beautiful melody.  Whereas an average person would need to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; something more drastic to experience a high.</i><br>

<p>
Yes. The big questions here are of course how to 1) become better able
to experience great experiences, including the "universe in a handfull
of dust", and 2) how to spread it to the average people so they don't
have to be average anymore :-)

<p>
<a href="2653.html#2744qlink3">&gt; Being able to experience lower lows, also means that you learn from</a><br>
<i>&gt; negative experiences, and you therefore are able to avoid them in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the future.</i><br>

<p>
Only when these downs can be handled well. Most depressive people, for
example, do not learn much from their awful experiences (at best they
learn to cope with them). Being able to view negative experiences as
learning experiences tends to transform them; they are no longer
perceived as negative, and in general people who can do it
consistently show a positive mood.

<p>
<a href="2653.html#2744qlink4">&gt; Unimpaired ability to experience emotions is GOOD.</a><br>

<p>
Exactly. But it can be made better.
