<p>
The consequence of this "acting on impulse" theory is that the real problems
with sudden violence doesn't happen in the violent act. The real problem
lies before that when the agressor convinces himself that violence is the
answer. He's making a faulty program for himself.

<p>
When you sit quietly at home thinking about what to do if somebody provokes
you it is easy to imagine a scenario where you have several options.


<OL>
  <li>  Run and escape (if you can). or
  <li>  Fight back (if there is no escape). or
  <li>  Fight back no matter what (to save face) or ...


</OL>
<p>
Lots of scenarios can be imagined. If you, because of pride, choose scenario
3) when you are quietly at home, then it is probably more likely that you
will do just that when in an agressive situation.<a name="1756qlink1"> If furthermore you decide
to carry a weapon there is a bigger risk of using it, because you have
</a>
actually decided to do it beforehand.

<p>
Many criminals pre-program their minds with the twisted meme that they have
to kill or mame to be cool. What is important is helping them to get another
program running.

<p>
<a name="1757qlink1"><a name="1756qlink2">Your theory is that the fear of a long sentence will make them think twice
about programming themself for violence.</a> This is indeed a logical
conclusion. The only problem<a name="1756qlink3"> is that the punishment does not seem to have
the wanted effect. Thus the empirical data does not support the theory.</a>
</a>

<p>
If that is so,<a name="1756qlink4"> what can we do differently to make them run the right
</a>
program?
