You forgot an equally likely possibility.
Three: You do believe in God and for that reason he sends you straight
to hell. God likes logical people and he knows he has not provided
mankind with information to prove his existence so belief in Him is
illogical.
<br>
Only militant atheists go to heaven.

...or God, being the capriciously sadistic monster portrayed in many of the
biblical books, will damn us all no matter what we do or think, just for
the, uh, hell of it.

<p>
There's yet a fourth possibility: if the Judeo-Christian God, or something
like him, exists, you may still be saved. Many Christians believe in
universal salvation, i.e. regardless of what you do or believe, God will
still save you in the end. This would be a lot more just than eternal
damnation for unbelief.

Thankfully, #4 seems overwhelmingly the most likely, while if a (just)
Supreme Being does turn out to be real, I think #2 far more likely than #1
or #3. So the odds are entirely in our favor.
