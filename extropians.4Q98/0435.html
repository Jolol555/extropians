If the brain is 600 miles across, and acts as a single entity, then its conscious
thoughts would be about the same speed as a humans. The contributions from the
sub-entities would take just as long to arrive as ours do, so I can't see it
thinking (as a single entity) any faster than us. The subconscious deliberation
behind each thought would of course be enormous.

<p>
Our particular brain model may not scale up very well.  Perhaps a better model
for the thinking process of such a large entity would be the supra-conscious
thinking of the human race, but speeded up tremendously. By supra-conscious
thinking, I mean the collective thinking we do through such processes as evolving
languages, cultures, economies, science etc. Perhaps the subentities of a Jupiter
brain would have time for interesting and fulfilling social lives, and well as
contributing to the (to them) incomprehensible thinking of the collective entity.
