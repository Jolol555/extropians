The situation seems to be evolving, so read the web page for
details, including how to help with their legal defense.

 For those of you who are not on the LovingMore mailing list, there
 is news that a MFM triad family who appeared on the recient MTV
 polyamory special have had a 3-yo daughter taken from them.
 
<p>
 Apparently the biological father of the child is *not* part of the
 existing triad, and the paternal grandparents are the ones suing for
 custody of the child. It seems that, at this point, the only evidence
 for taking the child is the MTV show itself.
 
<p>
 For more information you can go take a look on the LovingMore message
 board &lt;<a href="http://www.lovemore.com/ultbb/Forum1/HTML/000138.html">http://www.lovemore.com/ultbb/Forum1/HTML/000138.html</a>&gt; to
 see the discussion going on there.

<p>
 This situation is one of *my* biggest fears. The thought that my kids
 *could* be taken from me simply because I am poly is a nightmare.
