<p>
Your point is well taken. I've implied as such in my writing but didn't
specifically state it. The new identity would be afforded only provisional
rights. Instigating its own gatekeeper AI would not be among these
provisional rights.

<p>
I've anticipated another problem with this one tier judgement approach. The
new me could desire to make some drastic change to its mental configuration.
However, knowing that it will be judged by the backup me and believing the
backup me might reject the drastic change, the new me does not make the
change. The backup me, ignorant of the intentions of the new me, judges the
new me to be acceptable and overwriting occurs. The new me then instigates
the change (and is always assured of being able to do so since it is the new
point of reference). I've been fooled by myself! Perhaps there will be a way
for the backup me to know the intentions of the new me. However, if the new
me comes up with the drastic change post-overwriting then the entire setup
up is compromised.

<p>
The solutions to this problem would be to have a periodic judgement by the
original (t=0) identity. For every period t, the t0 identity would judge the
resulting identity of the past t period's experimentation and changes. This
identity can be archived as usual. If t0 decides that t1 is acceptable then
t1 is allowed to continue onwards. At t=2, t2 would be reviewed by t0. If t0
decides t2 is unacceptable t0 can begin with t0 or t1. To this extent, all
my identity changes would be vulnerable to my original identity. The biggest
danger here is a lack of understanding on the part of t0. t0 might not
understand the positive aspects of a t(n) configuration and thus t0 could
place an absolute limitation on the development of my identity over time.

<p>
When I have time, I'll try and develop this whole idea more completely (and
more coherently!).
