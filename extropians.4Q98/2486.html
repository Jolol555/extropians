<a name="2510qlink1"><a name="2495qlink1">I've always felt that the proper role of government</a> is to provide services that:


<OL>
  <li>  can be provided by the government at a lower cost then anybody else can, owing to economies</a> of scale


</OL>
<p>
or

<p>
<a name="2510qlink2"><a name="2495qlink2">B) services that it would be inapproiate or impossible</a> for private citizens to provide.</a>

<p>
<a name="2495qlink3">Viewed this way, the citizen's relationship to the government is no more coercive then then a citizens relationship to another citizen who is providing a service, and taxes are simply a bill for services rendered.</a> The "violence" associated with non-payment of taxes is no more reprehensible then "violence" associated with non-payment of any other bill.

<a name="2510qlink3"><a name="2495qlink6"><a name="2495qlink5"><a name="2495qlink4"><a name="2492qlink1">The only hole in this, of course, is the lack of ability in most</a> countries for a citizen to "opt out" of government services. My brother feels that allowing opting out would be a bad idea. I think I agree, at least for certain category B services that are both very important and whose utility decreases as the amount of buy-in decreases.

<a name="2510qlink4">P.S. I seem to have missed the introduction of this "PPA" concept.</a> Could someone enlighten me?
