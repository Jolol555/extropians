 &gt; [environmental impact]<br>

<p>
Intuitively, global environmental impact of having a goodly fraction
of Sahara paved with a low-albedo material should not be so very
dramatic (but we oughta model that, right). Locally, terrific upwinds,
yes. Even more dramatic temperature delta between day and night, 
certainly. Some more heating up of large city cores due to 
exported heat, of course. However, this will be more than compensated 
by reductions of greenhouse gases, and a possibility to regreen, 
say, Sahara in the shades below PV panels/desalinators -- global
warming? which global warming? 

<p>
In any case does orbital PV microwaving power down to terrestrial
rectenna arrays appear preferable. Better highly localized EM smog 
(remember Waldo?), than L.A. photosmog, imnsho.

If at all, seasonally only. Notice that many of the areas you
mentioned are politically instable -- another big con against a
centralization.

Uh, wrong. Unless you manage to supersede (uh, well, postpone) market 
economics by a Grand Extinction Event with Gray Goo nanoscale
autoreplicators, macroscopic autoreplicators are bottlenecked 
<a name="0904qlink2">by energy, land, and neighbour good will. You can purchase and 
autoreplicator-tile a major test site in 3rd world country, but 
don't try this at home (do we have any extropians from 3rd world
countries???) . In a pinch, you'd get nuked.</a> (Uh, I forgot: 
distributed uranium extraction from non-ores like granite and 
isotope enrichment in situ: grow your own).

<p>
You _could_ seed an asteroid/comet kernel, but, unless properly 
claimed (legislation will catch up very soon once the possibility 
of space development by autoreplicators has been demonstrated), 
many would interprete this as space piracy. (You could, probably
successfully, try to outrun the expansion of lawniks into space by
sending your panspermia nuclei far enough so they constitute a local
power the expanding 'civilization' front has to reckon with).

'too cheap too meter', eh? The only pluses of centralized power is
ease of administration and fuel efficiency. Of course if you make your
energy locally from fossils, you can couple thermals to power, which
is not feasible in large centralized power plants due to lossage (try
Moscow, Russia for a nice instance of a major energy bagbiter). 
Administration is not a problem today, since the advent of automation 
using digital electronics. The only problem is fuel monopoly, which 
only applies to fossil, not solar. The only reason against going solar
in the Southern U.S. is 1) large initial installation cost 2) yearly 
maintanance cost. Otoh, the resulting power is much cleaner (no 
spikes, glitches et al., no smog), and you're independant from remote,
politically instable countries (let the boys stay home).

<a name="0904qlink3"> &gt; [ubiquitous autoreplicators]<br>

<p>
A factory churning out PV panels and copies of itself in the flat
desert is one matter, an autoreplicator running amok in Silicon Valley
</a>
is another entirely. Once you have to adapt to a complex environment,
the task complexity and thus also system's jumps way up. The 
bottleneck in automation today is processing power, as our 
sensomotorics seems to be more than adequate. Since processing 
power equates to an advanced silicon foundry, complexity suddenly 
jumps up. 

<p>
 &gt; [cheap rooftop power kits from autorep] <br>

<p>
With a fraction of the development costs to set up an autoreplicator
you can jolt the market into large enough numbers so that economy of 
<a name="0904qlink4">scale can kick in. Otoh, we certainly need R&amp;D investment into
autorep, specifically into space-capable autorep. (I think NASA has
really goofed that one up).

<a name="0904qlink5"> &gt; [component size is irrelevant. you will be assimilated]</a><br>
 
<p>
<a name="0904qlink6">I think the problem relates more to processivity/autorep grain size. Notice
that from a certain speed growth mechanism start do dominate: unless 
capable of spawning remote nuclei (requiring a yet another feature:
efficient transport), the best you get is a circular/spherical growth
propagation wave (due to volume/surface ratio material transport
thru-cell near surface will peak high enough to bottleneck).</a> 
In any case, at the high end you'd be hard pressed out outrun your light cone ;)
