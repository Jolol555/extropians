<p>
I would never ever presume to tell you what you were<a name="0181qlink1"> feeling, but what you
describe sounds on the surface more like obsessive-compulsive behavior
connected to some variant of an existential crisis.</a>  Depressed people
are rarely as driven as you describe yourself to have been.  They believe
things are pretty hopeless and see themselves as helpless to effect any
change.  You, on the other hand, saw yourself as an agent of change.
Your actions were responsible for your own evolutionary development.
Way to go!  Don't want to belabor the point, it just didn't sound like
clinical depression the way you described it.

<p>
I, for one, do appreciate you sharing such a personal and clearly
distressing
<br>
episode from your life.<a name="0181qlink2">  The Darwinian "Aha" experience for me was more
drawn out and therefore less traumatic.</a>

<p>
Ciao for now,
