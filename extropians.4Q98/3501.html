anders, i should have written impedance.  i think it went thru a range
of frequencies and measured em impedance, not resistance.

could be.  now that i think about it tho, this came up on this list
months ago.  lotta folks dont want perfect identification connected
with their every credit purchase.  a good friend and extropian
(from before we even knew what we were called) has taken to
using cash for everything, using the cash machine instead of a
credit card.  carries several hundred bucks cash on him all the
time and would sooner eat dirt than allow a cookie to be set
on his computer.  {8^D  the catch is, he wasnt always that way.
this attitude developed in the past couple years.  (?)
