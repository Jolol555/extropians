Y2K  Solution!
<br>
8  Pine  Circle  Dr., Silicon  Valley, Calif.

<p>
OTC  Company  "TCFG"  21 st. Century  Frontier  Group  has
through  several  members  of  their  administrative  research
department  leaked  vital  information  about  their  companies  
efforts.

<p>
Everyone  was  tight  lipped  and  interviews  were  refused,
and  through  un-named  sources  we  have  learned  that  the  
technology  and  software  solution  are  in  the  process  of  
being  patented!

<p>
In over  1640  trials, using  various  data  systems  the  use  
of  the  new  technology  and  software  solved  the  Y2K
problem  100%  of  the  time. 

<p>
This  small  publicly  traded  company  "TCFG"  which  is  just
3  years  old  is  through  various  sources  now  negotiating
with  the  "Big  Boys"!

<p>
"TCFG"  the  letters  to  look  for.....<br>
