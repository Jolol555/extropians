Abstract
<br>
  The present report describes the biological effects associated with the
  feeding of three selenium-rich natural products in rats: high-selenium
  garlic, high-selenium onion and Brazil nut.
  The first two are experimental crops cultivated with selenium fertilization.
  Brazil nut is probably the only
<br>
  unadulterated high-selenium food that is available commercially. Tissue
  selenium profiles, liver glutathione concentrations and mammary cancer
  inhibition (in the dimethylbenz[a] anthracene model) were the endpoints of
  investigation. Parallel designs were set up to compare the three
  high-selenium products with selenite and selenomethionine. Previous studies
  have shown that treatment with seleno-methionine resulted in significantly
  greater tissue selenium accumulation, particularly in skeletal muscle, than
  treatment with selenite. In contrast, selenite, but not selenomethionine,
  induced a modest increase in liver glutathione concentrations. The objective
  was to determine whether the high-selenium natural products elicited
  responses that were similar to that of selenite or selenomethionine. Our
  experiments suggested that the high-selenium garlic and onion might have some
  unique attributes. First, their ingestion did not lead to an exaggerated
  accumulation of tissue selenium, a concern that was shared by both
  selenomethionine and Brazil nut. Second,
  unlike selenite, they did not cause any perturbation in glutathione
  homeostasis. Third, they expressed good anticancer activity that was equal
  to, if not better than, that of selenite. The chemical form(s) of selenium
  present in the high-selenium Allium vegetables will be discussed in relation
  to the manifestation of the above characteristics.
