One of the reasons why I loved living in Seattle. In the 8 years I was living in
that area, it never got hotter than 92 or colder than 10 deg. We only had one
relatively dry summer, but I also never recall any hot/humid days like those that
are so frequent here on the east coast. Snow only fell in the city every one in
three years, while 45 minutes up the highway there was 10-20 feet of snow at some
great ski areas. The claim that it rains 'all the time' in Seattle is mostly a
rumor created by Californians (What the hell do they know about rain anyways???),
but maintained and spread by Seattle natives to keep people from moving there. As I
recall, there are as many rainy days in Seattle as in New York City. The only
difference I could see is that a rain storm that took 30 minutes to a couple hours
in NY could take all day long to drop as much or less rain in Seattle.

Looking at the global weather patterns, wind, wave and tide topographical maps, its
apparent that the Pacific Northwest exists in a definite bubble of serenity
compared to elsewhere.
