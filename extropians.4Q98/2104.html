<i>&gt; books?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I would have recommended _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_, which does go rather deeply
into a lot of esoteric knowledge about early christianity which the church has
suppressed, but a recent book by the same authors, which as I recall is called
_The Search for God_, which is supposed to be a sequel to the first is rather
circular in its logic. Based on the first, which supposes that christ was buried
in a tomb in the south of France either by early gnostic christians led by Mary
Magdalene and John of Aramathea who migrated to the Marseilles area, or by the
Templars after their return from the Crusades, where they found his corpse. The
second book goes through some rather convoluted analysis of gravestones, maps
and old paintings to triangulate on a site in a mountain where they claim the
corpse is buried.

<p>
I'm not that up on religious dissident opinions as others may be. However
several facts suport my earlier assertion about the political status of Jesus:


<OL>
  <li>  different gospels trace Jesus' lineage to both houses of David through both
parents, and other esoteric texts trace the lineage of Mary Magdalene as being
that of the House of Saul.
  <li>  That Jesus was often referred to as 'rabbi' indicates that he was married, as
a rabbi must be married, at least in that day and age.
  <li>  That Jesus was referred to by servants at the Wedding at Canae (about the
lack of wine) indicates that he was the groom. Who did he marry?
  <li>  During the time he and the disciples lived with Lazarus, Mary Magdalene, and
Martha, we see the incident where Martha, a spinster, complains to Jesus about
Mary not doing any chores. Spinster women in jewish families lived in the homes
of their married siblings or parents at the time and were expected to do the
housework.
  <li>  The adultress incident: a 'woman' is brought to Jesus for commiting adultery,
for him to judge. When a woman commited adultery, the woman's husband was the
person who judged.


</OL>
<p>
I'd recommend the Nag Hammadi to anyone. With the gospels of Mary and Thomas,
the only two gospels actually written by actual disciples, it seems to me to be
more credible than the gospels of the bible.
