Those particular roads were only partially paid for by taxpayer dollars.
We have toll booths up here in NH too, but only two main ones plus a few
on the exits in between. It pays for the cost of maintaining the roads
(unlike california, we have this pesky problem in the winter called
snow...). It helps prevent the further increase in the gas tax.

An hour northwest? That would be either<a name="3104qlink2"> west of Lowell, towards Groton,</a>
or up around Concord NH, depending on what highway you were going
northwest on. We have a few Walmarts, and actually between the NH border
and Concord there are some spectacular malls. We do like to keep the
sprawl of LosAngelization out of our state though, but since we have no
sales tax, the flatlanders love to come up here shopping. We even have
two state liquor stores right off the highway north of the border (they
are the only thing you can go to from the exit ramps).... a lot of
traffic from Massachusetts to save on sales tax there too.

<p>
Actually, a Walmart is being finished in West Lebanon, which is part of
my hometown here. There's also lots of malls right there too, as its
right on the Vermont border, and the Vermonters love to come shopping
here too.
