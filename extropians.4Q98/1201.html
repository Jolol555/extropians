jason, consider what just happened on this forum in the past 10 days.  you
tossed out a meme, several people grokked it (love that word), someone
else asked a question, someone proposed a poll, we all learned something
new about ourselves and our thought space.  a meme spawned new
memes.  it might not sound like much, but the wonderfulness of this
phenomenon should be fully.... grokked.  {8^D  truly, the internet is
the greatest application of electricity ever invented.  spike
