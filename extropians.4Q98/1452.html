<i>&gt; Immortality at last Ray Kurzweil's new book is a real stunner. He predicts</i><br>
<i>&gt; that in the fairly near future people will be half-human, half-machine. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; BY Daniel Lyons </i><br>
<i>&gt; Forbes </i><br>
<i>&gt; 11/30/98 </i><br>
<i>&gt;    In four decades computers will be smarter than we are. Their software</i><br>
<i>&gt; will imitate our brains so well that you won't know whether it's a person</i><br>
<i>&gt; or machine you're dealing with on the phone or the Internet. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a big disappointment to many early</i><br>
<i>&gt; backers, but that's because they expected too much too soon, according to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Raymond Kurzweil, AI guru and author of The Age of Spiritual Machines</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Viking, January 1999), his third book. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kurzweil doesn't care much about expert systems such as those spawned by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Edward Feigenbaum; they're useful, he says, but limited. He's more</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in finding a way to "reverse engineer" the human brain so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; we can download everything about ourselves--our memories, our dreams, our</i><br>
<i>&gt; personalities--into a computer, a process he calls</i><br>
<i>&gt; "reinstantiation."Immortality at last. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The line between machines and people will blur even further as we age and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we'll be inserting machines into people to replace aging or inadequate</i><br>
<i>&gt; body and mind functions. Just as artificial hips now restore human body</i><br>
<i>&gt; functions, so too will neural implants enhance our hearing, vision and</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kurzweil, 50, is not just a dreamer. Over the past 25 years he has built</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sold four companies. His first, Kurzweil Computer Products, built a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reading machine for the blind and was bought by Xerox. One of its first</i><br>
<i>&gt; customers was musician Stevie Wonder, whose friendship with Kurzweil led</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the development of computerized music synthesizers. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An upcoming project is a program for fund managers creating an</i><br>
<i>&gt; artificially intelligent financial analyst that outperforms humans. "This</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology is going to be huge," he says. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; FORBES recently met with Kurzweil in his small Waltham, Mass. office,</i><br>
<i>&gt; where the walls are decorated with newspaper clips about the performances</i><br>
<i>&gt; of his father, Fredric, a concert pianist, and a picture drawn by an</i><br>
<i>&gt; AI-powered computer. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Forbes: Is your new book science or science fiction? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If anything, my views are conservative. The predictions are based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies you can touch and feel today. I don't think anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; studies this stuff carefully would say these things are never going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="1471qlink1"><i>&gt; Your book gets pretty weird: People scan their brains into a computer and</i><br>
<i>&gt; create self-replicas. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By 2040 it will be routine. If you build a computer based on the design of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the human brain and instantiate information from a human being onto that</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer, it will emerge in the machine and claim to be that person. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine will say, "I grew up in Brooklyn, I went to MIT, then I walked</i><br>
<i>&gt; into a scanner and woke up here in the machine."</a> </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How are you going to reproduce a human brain? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We can just copy it, bit by bit, connection by connection, neuron by</i><br>
<i>&gt; neuron, synapse by synapse.It's right there in front of us.Human neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not so vastly complicated that we can't understand them or replicate</i><br>
<i>&gt; them. We've already replicated the input-output characteristics of</i><br>
<i>&gt; clusters of hundreds of neurons. The question is: What is the feasibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; of scaling up from hundreds of neurons to billions of neurons? And that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not a big deal. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You say reinstantiated humans will have bodies created with</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology, which will let us build devices--even fake human</i><br>
<i>&gt; organs--at the atomic level? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Things like nanotubes are not actually fully working yet. But it's already</i><br>
<i>&gt; well under way in laboratories. Nanotechnology is a $5 billion industry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; All I'm doing is looking at trends to see where we are likely to be in</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms of computational capability and the sophistication of software and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the dexterity of certain physical technologies, like nanotechnology. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Would you reinstantiate yourself? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Probably. But I may end up jealous of the new Ray in that he shares my</i><br>
<i>&gt; history, my desires and my longings, but will be in a far better position</i><br>
<i>&gt; than old Ray to fulfill them. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These are going to be very smart entities--much smarter than humans. And</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's really where power lies. Ultimately these entities will have</i><br>
<i>&gt; political power. They will have all the political power. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is good news? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some people who've read the book have come away feeling depressed. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; get the idea that human beings are ending, that civilization is ending.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually we will continue, but in a much more profound way. The human race</i><br>
<i>&gt; is going to evolve. We are going to become smarter by merging with our</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A lot of folks will say, stop the world, I want to get off. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's unstoppable.It's part of the fundamental laws of the universe. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not an alien invasion. It's emerging from within our civilization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We're already pretty intimate with our computers. As we move forward, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nexus between machines and humans will become even more intimate. </i><br>
