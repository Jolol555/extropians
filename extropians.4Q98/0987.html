<p>
The types of damage to biological caused by 
temperatures below their optimum are manifold, 
and still largely unknown. Proteins denaturate, 
as a result some superstructures are damaged or 
fragment, lipid bilayers undergo phase transitions, 
as the result integral membrane protein structure 
and/or their distribution get disturbed. Further 
down the slow thermal descent (only tiny specimens 
can be cooled rapidly) extracellular ice growth 
begins, increasing the cytosol concentration 
(which in itself is denaturating to many proteins). 
Randomly oriented ice crystals anisotropically 
deform tissue by pushing it along their main 
growth axis. If ice is removed by freeze-substitution 
(washed out with, say, isopropanol at dry ice 
temperature), the resulting tissue strongly resembles 
an irregular mesh, with about 100 um holes iirc. Though 
difficult to assess without watching the dynamics 
process/using cell markers, the whole tissue looks 
scrambled (randomly, nonlinearly distorted). If 
frozen tissue is warmed, ice crystals melt suddenly, 
resulting shrunken cells full of highly concentrated 
cytosol to be surrounded by solute of low ionic 
strength -- causing cells to rupture due to osmotic 
shock, resulting membrane debris closing up into 
vesicles. You think you see lots of intact structures, 
but a lot of them are just artefacts. (Notice that
most of these points, grave as they are, are largely
irrelevant to the gros of the patients, where
factors like system-wide damages due to the original 
disease/age, hour-long normothermic ischaemic 
damage (go neuro, people, the periphery is junked, 
anyway), clotting and spotty perfusion, mechanical 
damague due to brain swelling etc. dominate 
overwhelmingly).

<p>
Of course we do not need to warm the patient for 
reconstruction, in fact the only way to do a mapping 
at molecular scale is to do it in solid state, using 
the structure as blueprints only. Since the scan is 
destructive, you essentially rebuild the structure 
anew minus the suspension damage (using damn 
smart filters), whether physically, or as model 
in machina (at least slicewise,as you will need 
for applying smart filtering, anyway). However, 
you are still facing a severe, very probably 
irreversible information loss due to the 
'turbulent' deformations (irreversible mapping: 
a given distorted structure could have been 
originated by a large number of structures, which 
are all more or less equally probable).

<p>
To avoid such information lossage we can use 
vitrification, fixation (with a complex perfusate/protocol 
which would have to be developed) and subsequent 
storage at low temperatures or uploading in vivo 
('gradual uploading'), which has the major advantage 
of supplying lots of low-level operation signatures 
for what is an essentially indefinite duration (which,
at the top level, you can even tweak or correlate 
with sensomotoric information). If the duration 
(hours to decades) and resolution (say, a 
sample/um^3) of the sampling is good enough, 
you essentially don't need to make a molecular 
map anymore.

<p>
Unfortunately, you need devices made with the 
mechanosynthetic paradigm, which is not yet validated.
