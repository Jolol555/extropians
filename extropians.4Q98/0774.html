<p>
Thanks John,
<br>
I was starting to worry that perhaps my question was too dumb to attract
an answer from the group -which in turn caused me to doubt whether I was
being realistic in hanging in here.
<br>
Your response, which I must admit, has not left me entirely satisfied
that I understand the problem any better, has at least reassured me, and
encourages me to hang</a> in.

<p>
If I have understood anything, it seems that (and Tipler says as much)
if a person can understand the proof of the halting problem, that person
is doing something that a computer program can't do ...as yet? ever?

<p>
Thanks again,
<br>
Michael
