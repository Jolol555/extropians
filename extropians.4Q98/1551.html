<a name="1554qlink1">This thread has been curious to read, as it is full of fact and falsity!
And, begs for female defense which I shall not even consider!

<p>
Joe E. Dees states: "Multiple connectionist schema within the 
cybernetic upload site might be required to accommodate the 
possibly distinct neural network patterns underlying these cognitively 
stylistic differences (verbal/aural vs. visual/spatial being the most 
documented and notable).  Comment ca vu?"

<p>
As I have posted so many times on this list and discussed until raw, there
are many theories about the cognitive differences in the male and female.

<p>
All I can know with certainty is what I experience first hand from
communications with both genders and the different cognitive abilities
expressed in relation to the environment and circumstances.  In other
words, when push comes to shove, the male and the female both use cognitive
skills theoretical non-gender-distinct when the occasion arises.</a> Both
genders use theoretical non-gender-distinct cognitive skills when the need
arises.  And, for the more competitive males and females, the theoretical
non-gender-distinct cognitive skills are used for advantage.

<p>
<a name="1784qlink1">Studies evidence that more and more females are excelling at mathematics
and the sciences.  Is this due to a gender cross-over, or social change?</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;From my experience (again my own experience is what gives me any crumbs of</i><br>
wisdom that I can claim), with a documentary-eye and brief experience
teaching, females are given more encouragement and taking more opportunity. 

<p>
Timothy Bates gives excellent reference to studies after Damien's "What?
*What????*  WHAAAAH" serenade that I even found my self humming while
reading along.  Michael reveals with his own documentary-eye by discussing
personality type and environmental situation and gender conditioning.
(Skiing didn't come easy to me, as I fell down quite a bit and swore like a
fishwife.  However, after much practice, I became a skilled skier.)

<p>
Ander's "No need for blue and pink uploading helmets" just might be the
summation we are looking for when considering how radically our gender-mix
will change our capability to think, and will no doubt change some
culturally pre-destined assumptions about thinking.
