<p>
    First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year.

<p>
    This last year has been a really trying year for me, but it has
set me up so that this future year (1999) will be by far the best
year of my life!.

<p>
    Anyway, there IS a reason for this message.  I'm not going to
get into it too much here -- but -- Dec 31, 1999 :

<p>
    What can we [as extropians] do to make sure that mankind doesn't
engage in any large-scale acts of stupidity resulting in massive deaths,

<p>
suicides, or destruction as people fear that above coming date?.

<p>
    I do not anticipate any "god-like" events, etc etc..  But what I DO
anticipate is there may be some people out there (stereotype :
religious fanatics) who will see that the world has not ended, and
decide to maybe, uh, take things into their own hands....

<p>
    These are the kind of people we need to be careful of.

<p>
    I'd like some input on some kind of mass extropian-education we
can create for people to put aside their chaotic fears, and their
obsolete beliefs/fantasies that all kinds of bad things will happen
on this date.

<p>
    The year 2000 bug doesn't really bother me - the people who are
in a position to fix this are also most likely smart enough to
understand
<br>
the reprecussions, and deal with them accordingly when they occur.
What does concern me is while there will be those religious fanatics,
there may also be a big outbreak of thieving, hacking, etc etc.  I mean,

<p>
come on "man", it's 2000! - "like, no one will be paying attention to
anything".....

<p>
    These things worry me a little.  Any input?
