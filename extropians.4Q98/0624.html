For obvious reasons, I've been concerned with this question for a number of
years, more so since Damien Broderick (!) expressed concern about my plans it
in The Spike.

<p>
<a name="0634qlink1">Let's ask the question this way:  Most people would say that we don't have the
right to modify a genome, or perform neurosurgery, to increase intelligence. 
Suppose a mutation arises naturally containing that modification.  Should he
be prevented from having children?  Can his genes be inserted artificially? 
Can an improved version be engineered de novo?</a>

<p>
And no, this isn't a theoretical argument.  One of the most powerful arguments
I intend to wield is that if you're going to prevent me from creating copies
of myself neurosurgically, you may as well prevent me from reproducing
biologically.  And is it such a large step from there to sterilizing the
stupid?  Jews?  Nazism lies not in the concept of a master race, or
sterilizing the "inferior", but in *any* denial of the right to exist on the
basis of genetics.

<p>
Despite such arguments, I still expect all cognitive engineering to be banned
in the U.S.  The question is not how to prevent this, but how to keep the
backlash from destroying the country long enough for the law to be repealed. 
For myself, I fight by changing the rules of the game, not in big flashy
confrontations.  I will inform my enemies who they are and that they have lost
when the battle is won.
