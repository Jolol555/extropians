Dozens. Apart from very well documented differences in language area size 
(a researcher at UNSW is doing some of this with post mortem cell counts: 
the differences are substantial) and other tasks such as spatial judgment 
(see  for a review), recently Goldberg been developing an approach that 
focuses on preferred style rather than ability using a cognitive 
preference task that I find interesting. I append the abstract below.</a>

<a name="1512qlink2">One reason that there is less on this than one might expect is that 
interest in this topic tends to generate the response that Damien was 
driven to emit, i.e.:

Anyhow, there is tons. From a neuropsych perspective, go to 
 &lt;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/medline.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/medline.html</a>&gt;
and enter this search or similar
<br>
((spatial[All Fields] AND (sex[All Fields] OR gender[All Fields])) AND 
difference[All Fields])

<p>
For fun add the term "laterality" to pick up neuroscience references.


<p>
Here is Goldberg's paper:

<p>
Podell K, Lovell M, Zimmerman M, Goldberg E  (1995) The Cognitive Bias 
Task and lateralized frontal lobe functions in males. J Neuropsychiatry 
Clin Neurosci 1995 Fall;7(4):491-501 

<p>
The Cognitive Bias Task (CBT) is a multiple-choice response selection 
paradigm characterized by inherent ambiguity. All items offer a range 
from extremely context-dependent to extremely context-invariant 
responses. Lateralized prefrontal lesions produce extreme, and opposite, 
response biases on CBT in right-handed males. Healthy control subjects 
perform in the middle range. Findings suggest a dynamic balance between 
two synergistic decision-making systems in the frontal lobes: 
context-dependent in the left hemisphere and context-invariant in the 
right. The robust lateralized effects, which are dependent on task 
ambiguity, are sensitive and specific to frontal dysfunction. CBT is 
discussed in comparison with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test as a 
potential cognitive activation task for functional neuroimaging of the 
frontal lobes.
