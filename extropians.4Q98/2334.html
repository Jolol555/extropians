Not to get too petty here, but its become obvious that you've taken this passage
*waaay* too literally, not to mention that in 1977, it was a scientific fact that
*linguistically* speaking the right brain was silent!  Patients in the classic
1950's experiment (conducted by Roger Perry*) where their corpus collosum was
severed, were completely unable to read, write or speak about what their left eye
was seeing.  This is not some zoned-out metaphor, but a fair assessment of the
known facts at that time.  This is exactly what Leary meant in 1977, and the fact
that you've missed such an obvious fact means that you really need adjust your
bogosity meter for more flexible functioning (i.e. it is hardly worth getting so
upset over what is a slight difference of semantics).

 *Note --For his split brain research, Roger Sperry (1913-1994) shared the 1981
Noble Prize in Physiology and Medicine with David Hubel and Torstein Wiesel.

If what you say is true Damien, this is the first case of a person winning the
Nobel Prize for a zoned-out metaphor!
