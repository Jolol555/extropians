This is already happening.  "Soft novelty devices" are illegal to sell
here in Texas.  Either the great legislature has a goal to keep it
from feeling good or they thoroughly enjoy causing high trauma to
those parts of peoples anatomy by limiting it to hard plastic. 
Ouch!!!!  I tend to favor the later theory.

Not generic ones.  But those with the inclination for quickly
<a name="0582qlink1">transitioning to intense full body orgasms are needed.  That is, if
other muscles begin to synchronize with your PC muscle such that many
simultaneous involuntary contractions are happening throughout your
body.  I need to identify these muscles that participate.  So far, it
appears most are internal (deeper inside the body), but I need to
identify ones that I have access to externally (just under the skin). 
I've not searched the literature on any of this because of my
disappointment on my initial attempt and the resulting success of
starting from scratch.  I still wonder if doing the proper research
will help or hinder.  It appears we have a badly neglected area of
research when a hobbiest without any background in biology or
physiology can make discoveries that should be widely known.</a>

<a name="0600qlink2">Why is the so called super organism "Meta Man" so secretive about
his/her/its physiological mechanisms for sexual pleasures?</a>  Does
she/he/it think a possible mate is watching/listening and maybe feels
a little embarrassed :-) (just kidding)  But seriously, is it possible
that, in its incredible wisdom, avoiding/delaying a positive feedback
loop is desirable (as in John Clarks theory).  If so "Meta Man" will
soon see the inevitable, with, or without my help.  Based on this
thread, there seems to be multiple emergent paths that have been
technologically possible for some time.  Prepare for a more even
distribution.
