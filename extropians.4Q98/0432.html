<a href="0429.html#0432qlink1">&gt;  Moreover; I would add that the multiple beings have one HugE</a><br>
<i>&gt; advantage</i><br>
<i>&gt; over, however wise and intelligent and whatever you can think of as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; realistic attribute, one and only one individual: the multiple points</i><br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt; view.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Even when a point of view is false, when parts of it include</i><br>
<i>&gt; contrary</i><br>
<i>&gt; beliefs, lies, redundancies, it's far more richer than one unique set</i><br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt; beliefs. An example: when a society of persons hold a belief contrary</i><br>
<i>&gt; to</i><br>
<i>&gt; its goals or its happiness, it's better than one individual set in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; same kind of beliefs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Manu.</i><br>

<p>
i'm not quite sure of that, an intelligent system with only one
identity, some part of this system who provide the illusion of being
one, probably to give to this system a quality of "adaptation" to his
environnement, can handle a lot of subagents, with something acting like
a central planner.
<br>
these subagents can compete and give their points of view. according to
certain rules (like darwinian evolution) the best points of view are
selected.

<p>
of course these agents can be very complicated and dynamically
evolutive.

<p>
i'm wondering what's the best topologies of intelligence could be, in
our solar system and his close surrounding, according to our actual
scientific worldview.

<p>
probably strong aglomeration of matter, to a certain extent provide huge
adventages.
<br>
but there is a compromise to reach between locality and dispersion.

<p>
we could imagine moon size computers surrounded by some kind of utility
fog build with something like the liliputian AI you were talking of.

<p>
or the moon size computers or asteroids used by a civilisation of small,
somewhat equals in their capacities, AI, as mere computers, tools.
with no embeded identity is the moon size, asteroids, or jupiter like AI
in such case.

<p>
i think of it and assuming the whole system is evolutive, i don't think
there is a easy to find configuration that is somewhat stable. Probably
there is some topological attractors in this problem anyway..

<p>
i would like to find more ressources according to this question...

<p>
is there somebody who can help?
