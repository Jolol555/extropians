Sounds suspiciously like Christians who argue that the Church shouldn't be
judged for the crusades, inquisition, witch burnings, etc. because that's
not "real" Christianity.<a name="3063qlink2">  In any event, "global capitalism" is what

<p>
<a href="2989.html#3015qlink6">&gt;True, in most cases it doesn't get to the point of force actually being</a><br>
<i>&gt;applied, but obviously the threat of force is there, and is just as wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or do you have no objection to a mugger, as long as he doesn't actually</i><br>

government to be acceptable.</a>  If a mugger offered something comparable in
<a name="3063qlink15">compensation for the mugging I probably wouldn't object as strongly.</a>

<p>
<a name="3063qlink16"><a href="2989.html#3015qlink7">&gt;&gt;Oh sure, at some abstract level the State could suddenly decide to ditch</a><br>
<i>&gt;our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;constitutional rights and blow us away for non-conformance, but in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;vast</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;majority of transactions this possibility is so remote</a> as to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;negligible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3063qlink17"><i>&gt;Bullshit, it happens every day. It's not at all abstract.</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3063qlink18">Every day, hardly.</a>

<p>
<a href="2989.html#3015qlink8">&gt;&gt;Now, if you want to talk rampant coercion in modern America, my exhibit A</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;would be the control businesses have over their employees.  To the average</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;American, the government is some remote entity with which one interacts on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;April 15 and election day.  One's boss, on the other hand, can very</i><br>
<i>&gt;quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and easily make one's life miserable if one fails to carry out his or her</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;wishes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Obviously you don't know what coercion means. I _choose_ to work for my</i><br>
<i>&gt;employer, and that entails accepting the conditions offered. If I didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;like the terms of employment I wouldn't be working there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There's no such contractual agreement with "government". It's a matter of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"an offer you can't refuse". _That's_ coercion.</i><br>

<p>
I've promoted a contract theory of labor before.  It seems like a good
model.  As has been pointed out to me, however, many people for one reason
or another don't have, or at least feel they don't have, as many options as
you feel you do.  If their lifelong employer decides to give them the boot,
it's the end of their world.

<p>
<a name="3063qlink19">As I often say, in the end people *always* have a choice.  You don't</a> have to
<a name="3063qlink20">do anything you don't want to, even if it's the guvmint doing the asking.
There are consequences, of course.</a>

<p>
<a href="2989.html#3015qlink9">&gt;&gt;Without getting into Samael's understanding of economics, even a beginning</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;economist recognizes the important distinction between positive and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;normative economics.  It's one thing, for example, to state that some</i><br>
<i>&gt;market</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;outcome is Pareto optimal, but another thing entirely to say we should</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;restructure our political and social systems to achieve said outcome.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're throwing out another red herring. There's no such thing as</i><br>
<i>&gt;"normative" economics. Economics describes, it never prescribes. Pareto</i><br>
<i>&gt;optimality means that everyone's objectives are being met as efficiently as</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible; it doesn't depend on how "worthy" any of those objectives are.</i><br>
<i>&gt;What you don't like about it, of course, is that it doesn't force people to</i><br>
<i>&gt;go along willy nilly with *your* objectives.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3063qlink21">There most certainly is such a thing as normative economics.  You can find
this terminology in any good intro economics text.  Objective descriptions
of economic behavior are quite a different thing than proposals</a> for economic
<a name="3063qlink22">policy.  Economists engage in both activities.</a>

<p>
<a name="3063qlink23">*My* objective is to live in a largely libertarian society under a
minimalist government.  Don't go jumping to conclusions about my motives.</a>

<p>
<a href="2989.html#3015qlink10">&gt;&gt;While I don't necessarily agree with everything either Samael or Joe is</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;saying, we must recognize that there are two sides to this story.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, on one side we want to keep the value we create, on the other side you</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to take it from us. Gosh, how does one choose sides on such a complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;and confusing issue?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3063qlink24">"I" want to take it from "you"?  I don't want to take anything from you.
Why do you think this?</a>

<p>
<a name="3063qlink25"><a href="2989.html#3015qlink11">&gt;&gt;Sure, governments do bad things, but so do businesses.</a></a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3063qlink26"><i>&gt;Business can't get away with bad things by dint of firepower</a> or "sovereign</i><br>
<i>&gt;immunity", however.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3063qlink27">True.  Mostly they have to rely on PR people to cover</a> their transgressions. 

<p>
<a name="3063qlink28"><a href="2989.html#3015qlink12">&gt;&gt;Personally, I'm much more</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;concerned about what my next (private sector) employer might do to me,</a> or</i><br>
<a name="3063qlink29"><i>&gt;&gt;try to make me do, than I am about the guvmint.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3063qlink30"><i>&gt;Don't make me throw up.</a></i><br>
