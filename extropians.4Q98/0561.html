<i>&gt; That's interesting.  Are you saying that you currently receive a New</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but it's a medical fact that when one has been systematically 
prevented from working and cut into by a whole spectrum of insiders 
ranging from Freemasons to the Chicago McMafia the criteria for 
survival becomes a condition for living. As an autistic person I 
have to think my way through circumstances that other people don't. 
Maybe this is why I didn't go along with the corruption I found 
inside the corporations who were my clients and felt obliged to 
cause them to leave this part of the world. At least their capital 
took fright and quit. Also, the fact that for twenty years my 
thinking has been aligned to the mathematics of The Ingrid Thought 
Processor has made my take on subjects very formidable if not 
idiosyncratic.

<p>

<a href="0557.html#0561qlink2">&gt; If so, do you concur with this assessment?  If you do, should this have any</a><br>
<i>&gt; bearing on our evaluation of your posts?  Presumably you do *not* concur,</i><br>
<i>&gt; given your use of the phrases `woefully inadequate' and `their social</i><br>
<i>&gt; constructions' and your startling candour in mentioning the pension.  Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you find any conflict in your personal values in accepting money under what</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore would be false pretences?</i><br>

<p>
No conflict. According to Max More and Robin Hanson, capital is 
not money and what I do involves the best use of my personal 
capital and I feel no need to justify myself in market/monetary 
terms. I have spoken out against the false limits of the money 
measuring system and for this I am now thankfully left alone 
and provided with the needs I have for food, shelter, communication 
and computer equipment and most of all for mind uploading. I 
don't pay taxes or pay salesmen to sell my software. I have 
no management make-work problems that would only slow me down. 
With nanotechnology on our horizon and other physical trends 
truly suited to my software time is on my side and I feel no 
need to try to convince capitalists of the need to grant 
development funds for my technology, which technology, btw, 
I anticipate will make the need for money funding a superfluous 
and futile effort.

<p>
The government's official claim that I have a thought disorder 
that makes me incapable of regular work is based on the 
definition of a disorder whereby a claim is made that some 
of my ideas have been consistently invalidated. I don't agree 
with this invalidation process although I agree that it has 
been pretty consistent and have produced evidence on my 
website that, in my opinion, has likewise consistently 
invalidated 'their social constructions'. So, this tit-for-tat 
is my way of living in a disordered system and doing the work 
that only I can do.

<a href="0557.html#0561qlink3">&gt; These questions are not meant as a flame - I do not know Mr Legg, and I am</a><br>
<i>&gt; genuinely intrigued by the issues raised.  Perhaps I should make clear that</i><br>
<i>&gt; over the last couple of decades I have eked out my own meagre earnings as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; writer with the aid of five arts grants from Federal and State Australian</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments, as well as a PhD scholarship from a national funding body.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; favour some kind of anarcho-socialist polity, for want of a better term, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which a guaranteed minimum income is provided, without strings, to all</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens.  I'm made uncomfortable, however, by the idea of someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; contriving to gain such benefits by *pretending* to be either somatically</i><br>
<i>&gt; or mentally ill.  If such a misdiagnosis were imposed upon me, I hope I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; fight it tooth and nail, rather than accepting any benefits that happened</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be entailed.</i><br>

<p>
I don't pretend to be a high functioning autistic person. I am. 
But you have no reason to be fearful that I will seek to harm 
anyone. However if anyone tries too hard to block my progress 
they can look forward to a visit from a constable. Maybe you 
may care to read my disability application which shows "Computers 
and people with autism... it's like a match made in heaven."

<a href="0557.html#0561qlink4">&gt; If Mr Legg actually *is* sufficiently mentally ill to require an invalid</a><br>
<i>&gt; pension, I apologise for the tenor of these sceptical remarks, and will</i><br>
<i>&gt; read his posts with this proviso in mind.</i><br>

<a name="0564qlink1">Exceptional thinking abilities and a desire to stay out of 
other people's potholes is what my posts convey.</a> Unfortunately 
<a name="0564qlink2">you can't read my earlier posts because they are mostly 
mis-registered in the extropy archives. I don't know why, 
but even though a search turns up the correct heading the 
body of the message points to quite a different message. 
Has this happened to others or are my posts destined to be 
forever censored?
