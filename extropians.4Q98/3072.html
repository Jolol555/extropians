How can you say that?  I have described corporate welfare!  The
government/monopoly allows certain corporations to do what they want
in exchange for money from the corporation.  Yes, the citizen gets the
shaft when the government interferes.  You are correct.  They get the
shaft because of corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers in
product price increases.  They get the shaft because the government
often allows exclusive markets to one or two companies, rather than
permitting the rest of the market competitors to actually compete for
consumer business.  Look at the FCC/AT&amp;T monopoly of old.  What
happened when the government monopoly was stopped and the market was
opened?  Competition began, prices began to drop, the products began
to improve, and the progress away from poor products and poor pricing
continues.  Free markets without government intervention works.
