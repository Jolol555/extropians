Let me apologize to everyone if I gave the impression I was
trying to propose something official.  Nick suggested we take our 
private conversation public, but I should have thought more before 
doing so.

<p>
I am vaguely aware that there have been discussions on this topic 
before which I have not paid great attention to, and I am also aware
that there are various people and organizations which have a stake 
in making "official" definitions.  

<p>
As Natasha mentioned, I'm newly the chief editor of J. of 
Transhumanism, which aspires to be an academic quality journal.
This inspired me to think a bit more about what exactly 
"academic-style transhumanism" does or should mean.   

<p>
As Max mentions, there are various kinds of definitions of terms.
I don't have much respect for PR-inspired definitions, intended to 
convince everyone else that they were really transhumanists all 
along.  I'm much more interested in socially-functional definitions
that actually do distinguish people and things frequently called 
"transhumanist" from everything else out there.  

<p>
I agree that normative associations are strong in the way people
seem to use the term.  I am made suspicious by the striking 
correlation between believing big change is coming and believing 
that's probably a good thing.  So I'm not sure whether normative
claims are really the root of what makes us different.  But for 
now I relent and say:

<p>
<a name="0304qlink1"><a name="0298qlink1">   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world so much in the few centuries that we or 
   our descendants will in many ways no longer be "human,"   
   and that that's probably a not a bad thing.</a></a> 

<p>
<a name="0298qlink2">Again, I'm not proposing this for anything official - just 
thinking out loud.</a>

<p>
<a name="0304qlink2">I do think that some sort of positive timing claim is needed, 
since I think if you push most thoughtful people they will admit 
such changes are quite possible over a time scale of say a 
billion years, and that such changes are probably not bad.  
Such people are not transhumanists in the usual usage of the term.</a>

<p>

<i>&gt;development beyond its current human limitations by means of science,</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think there is room for improvement here, but I think that re-defining</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism to exclude normativity turns it into something else.</i><br>

<p>
I'm concerned that this sort of definition isn't ideal for 
"academic-style transhumanism."  For this purpose, one wants to focus 
on the aspects of "transhumanism" of most interest to academics, most 
amenable to academic tools, and avoiding academic hot buttons.

<p>
<a name="0304qlink3">Most academics consider themselves rational people contributing to
intellectual progress, and don't consider "philosophies of life" to be
terribly academic.  Max's definition seems a bit too imprecise for 
academic tastes, for example, being coy about what "limitations" are 
</a>to be overcome.
