Just like "quantum teleportation", it's a cool-sounding technique which 
isn't very useful in the real world. I forget the precise details of 
his experiment because I skimmed them at the time and realised very quickly 
that it didn't do what the media said it did; yes, the signal tunnels through 
in less time than light would take to travel that distance, but it takes so 
long to start tunnelling that the average velocity is still slower than 
light.
