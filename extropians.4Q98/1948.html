<p>
	In less than one week, on Saturday, December 5th, the second
annual East Coast CryoFeast will get underway.
<p>
	Starting at 5pm, in the home of Tony Reno in Pepperell, MA,
life-extensionists, cryonicists, and other transhuman and Extropian
individuals will gather to discuss mind, matter and the very question of
Being. 
<p>
	Come and enjoy the company of other intelligent and like-minded
individuals, for an evening that is certain to be stimulating.  Socialize
and make new friends, attach faces to those names that you know by email,
and learn what others are doing in the fields of technology, philosophy
and academia.
<p>
	Bring along your favorite food to this pot-luck gathering, and
invite your friends.  More minds, more ideas...
<p>
	The annual CryoFeast is organized in conjunction with Natasha Vita
More and other CryoFeasts worldwide.  Come and explore this local and
global celebration of life and its possibilities!
