Have no fear.  Ayn Rand is dead and recants nothing.  ;)

I'm anarcho-capitalist, myself, and will occasionally put my $0.02 in when
the thought strikes me.  I think the vast majority of us are still
anti-state.  We debate the point occasionally; you've reached us during an
off period as far as those debates go.  (Arguably, such debates are a waste
of everyone's time anyway.)

Personally, I'm trying to earn a biomedical engineering degree just</a> as fast
as my little brain can take it.  I take anti-oxidants daily.  I don't
exercise as much as I read, but I'm reading good stuff, so hopefully I've
reached a good balance.  I'm hoping that we'll ultimately reach the point
where the technology itself will catalyze the political changes we have in
mind.  I'm optimistic towards the future and look forward to boundless
improvement in the years to come.
