<i>&gt; &gt;If a society cannot trust the individual, how can it trust a group of</i><br>

<a name="2371qlink2"><i>&gt; &gt;especially when our interests are in conflict. Applying this</a> principle to</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;social/cultural issues, but not to economic relationships reflects a lack</i><br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;integrity which I find disturbing, and untrustworthy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Because, like most ideals,  the system breaks down under certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Take, as an example, garbage collection.  Everyone has garbage.  None of us</i><br>
<a name="2371qlink5"><i>&gt; want it cluttering up our kitchens.  We coul set things up so</a> that each of</i><br>
<a name="2371qlink6"><i>&gt; us pays a small fee to have out rubbish picked up.  but some people will</i><br>
<i>&gt; decline to pay.  Now their rubbish is affecting me.  Should I pay</a> for their</i><br>
<a name="2371qlink7"><i>&gt; rubbish to be removed?  Or should we force them to pay gfor their</a> rubbish to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be removed?  Or just have their steaming piles of decomposing filth collect</i><br>
<a name="2371qlink9"><i>&gt; in the middle of the street?</i><br>

<p>
Well, in an anarchical situation, they have the choice of getting</a> their trash
<a name="2371qlink10">taken away or having me bazooka their front yard.</a> In a libertarian situation,
<a name="2371qlink11">they have the choice of taking it away or paying the impact</a> their slovenliness
<a name="2371qlink12">has on my property value, as well as my increased costs for vermin</a> control and
<a name="2371qlink13">possible health impacts once I've complained to my PPA, which</a> contacts their
<a name="2371qlink14">PPA, which imposes a higher premium on them for the increased risk they are
assuming, which would likely equal or exceed the weekly fee for trash
removal.... funny how that can work out.</a>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2307.html#2329qlink2">&gt; Another example: Neonatology - medicine as applied to babies.</a><br>
<i>&gt; A baby is born with a defect.  the baby is a person.  It has no income and</i><br>
<a name="2371qlink16"><i>&gt; no resources.  Should it's parents be forced to pay for it, even if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't, even if they don't want to?  Should it be asked for a credit card</i><br>
<i>&gt; number when it's born?</i><br>

<p>
The parents would of course have coverage under their private</a> health insurance.
<a name="2371qlink17">Parents who cannot afford to bear or keep a child should not keep</a> the child. A
<a name="2371qlink18">poor person's PPA could easily set a high premium for the person if</a> they are
<a name="2371qlink19">fertile, and low if they agree to a contraceptive implant for a long term.</a> Its
<a name="2371qlink20">all about making people take responsibility for their actions,</a> and paying for
<a name="2371qlink21">them. If they cannot afford them then they learn quickly enough</a> about personal
responsibility.

<p>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2371qlink22"><a href="2307.html#2329qlink3">&gt; Just two problems that pure libertarian capitalism has problems with.</a><br>

<p>
Hardly, since pure libertarian capitalism has not and does not exist</a> to date,
<a name="2371qlink23">you don't know do</a> you?

<p>
<a name="2371qlink24"><a href="2307.html#2329qlink4">&gt; I agree that Libertarian Capitalism works in 90% of all cases and that it</a><br>
<i>&gt; should eb left to do so as much as is physically possible.  But no system</i><br>
<i>&gt; works 100% of the time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Sure it can. The solar system has been working fine for billions of years.</a> The
<a name="2371qlink25">fun thing about libertarianism is that it allows the market</a> to create solutions
<a name="2371qlink26">for ANY problem. It prices those solutions at their TRUE value, so</a> nobody has to
<a name="2371qlink27">pay for something they don't want to, and well meaning busy bodies cant ram
anything down anybody's throat.
