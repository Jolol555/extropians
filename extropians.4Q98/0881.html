players. A purpose-designed player with several hours of voice on ROM would
cost less than two dollars. Radio is more flexible but is subject to jamming.
The device should be powered photovoltaically, like a cheap calculator.
I would go for a dual-purpose device. However, I don't know enough about the
culture to know how the devices would get from their landing sites into the
possession of the women.
