<a name="2160qlink1"><a name="2141qlink1"><a name="2140qlink1">Pascal's wager is restated to argue a different point:

<p>
<a href="2061.html#2136qlink1">&gt; One: if you do not believe in christian god there are two</a><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities, if christian god exists you will go in hell,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it doesn't nothing happen.  Two: if you do believe in god,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and it doesn't exist, then there is no consequence, but if</i><br>
<i>&gt; it does (finally) exist, then JackpoT!!! you go in heaven.</i><br>

<p>
Poster contends that the fallacy is lack of probabilities,
but it is actually quite a bit simpler and more obvious than
that: the premises of the argument are simply false.  There
/is/ a cost to belief, and there /is/ a benefit to non-belief,
and both the costs and benefits of both choices must be
evaluated to make a rational choice.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2160qlink2"><a name="2141qlink2">Indeed, I personally think that it is not possible for a
person who honestly believes in God to be a moral person or
lead an effective, worthwhile life, so the cost of belief
is very high--the sacrifice of this life for the false hope
in the next.</a></a>

<p>
The same logical fallacy is often used to argue for cryonics.
(replace "belief" with "cryo-contract", "heaven" with
"survival", and "hell" with "death").  The fallacy is the
same: there /is/ a measurabe cost to cryonics (in hard cash)
and possible benefits to abstention (though these are more
speculative: perhaps the money you save will be invested in
better immortality technologies).  On balance, I think
cryonics is the right choice to make (it is for me), but not
because of such weak arguments.</a>
