It's an excellent book.  I'm pleased to see that he's posted the last few
chapters; I may want to go back and read them now.

However, I also notice that he seems to have moved away from his opinion
that anarcho-capitalism generates the most efficient rules.  (This, indeed,
is almost all of the reason why I like anarcho-capitalism.)  Similarly,
most of his book is about which rules are efficient; he leaves the question
as to which systems make the best rules to the last chapter, where he
states that "the jury is still out" on the question.
