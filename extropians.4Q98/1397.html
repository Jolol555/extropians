<i>&gt; &gt;  "You are Asian, you must be good at Maths". "You are black, you must be stupid".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; springs to mind where it might be valid to treat individuals differently based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; race. That is in testing for certain heritable genetic diseases. I'm hard pressed</i><br>

<p>
 It seems our brains amplify the significance of small average differences. We go from,
"men are on average taller than women" to " men are taller" to  "couples in which the
man is shorter are weird".  This kind of social logic may have had some survival value
to our ancestors. However, I think it makes the kind of diverse society I would like to
live in less likely, so it is a thought process I try to resist.
