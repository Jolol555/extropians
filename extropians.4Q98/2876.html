as an aside to this...

<p>
During the seventies I was in something called "Operation BootStrap" .  It was
a program whereby enlisted personell in the Armed Farces could acquire a
degree and thence go on to orificer training.

<p>
The OS didn't happen..but that's a nother story.

But back to the point...the younger students ...HATED it when bootstrappers
were also present....I'm told that we "skewed" the curve.
