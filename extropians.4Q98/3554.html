My point is simply that it isn't productive to speculate on the terminal
evolution of the universe based on a theory that is almost certainly
incorrect.  It is possible that some moderate adjustment of the big
bang/inflation model will make it fit reality, but it is just as likely that
the entire concept will have to be thrown out.</a>  If that happens, who knows
<a name="3597qlink3">what the new parameters will be?  Meanwhile, why generate angst over purely
hypothetical events that might happen billions of years in the future?</a>
