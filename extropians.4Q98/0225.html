i have an idea: perhaps seasonal affected depression is humanity's
equivalent of hibernation.  the portion of mankind that has evolved
in the far north had a slightly better chance of survival in winter
if they were severely depressed.  the depressed would be more likely to
stay indoors and sit still, thereby conserving scarce energy while avoiding
the risk of going out in the harsh winter night, as their cabin fevered nondepressed
 cohorts might be tempted to do.  this could cause the
tendency to s.a.d. to spread thru the population after some generations.
this would explain why the russian, the eskimo, the swede<a name="0282qlink1"> (my ancestors),
the danish, the finnish, etc, seem to have more sad than the jew, the
african, et.al from gentler, more hospitable climates.</a>
whaddya think?  spike
