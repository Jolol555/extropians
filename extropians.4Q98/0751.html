&gt;&gt; A manufacturing base which could produce thousand square

pre-nano superintelligence?  Just a thought. &lt;&lt;

<p>
Yes, and even if no real (super) intelligence were forthcoming, it 
would still be the most powerful (centralized) computer on the 
planet, that's always useful.

<p>
I think there are lots more of these great opportunities that are staring us
in the face (like the mind stimulator -- hey Eliezer, how about building one
of those? ;-) It's really too bad that there isn't some kind of focussed
transhuman effort to do produce and market some of our more feasible
ideas. If you set up a company, everyone could buy a couple of shares
to start it up. If it fails, personal losses are small, if it turns out to be
the next Microsoft then everybody's a big winner. Makes sense? Surely,
if all those bright minds on this list alone worked together on a single
product there should be some good results fairly soon.
