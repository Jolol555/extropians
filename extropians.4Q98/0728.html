It looks like you tacitly agreed with an abstract concept like
*conflict*, *protocol*, or whatever, as being the basis of politics and
not the individual per se. Btw, my own personal preference for a
hypothetical future is robo-socialism which is unlike your definition of
a common garden state sponsored socialism, so please don't pin your
prejudice on what robo-socialism under nanotechnology could be and as to
your analogy of whether its a network computer or a local intelligent PC
doesn't matter to me. The point of robo-socialism, as I define it, is a
two-way Survey Society which usurps and redefines the role of the state
so that the negative connotations of the surveillance state are
counteracted by the positive connotations of a Survey Society. It is not
a one person one vote system and isn't majority rule. It is one feature
- one ranking; - resulting in independent component analysis and
feedback. Such a large group of corresponding public AI systems
primarily impacts secrecy as in David Brin's transparency.
