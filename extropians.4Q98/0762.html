<a name="0777qlink1"><a href="0759.html#0762qlink1">&gt;Here's a potentially better protocol:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First the entity must ask itself, what am I trying to accomplish, what am I</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to become, what is my goal? Setting a goal is essential to actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting anywhere.</i><br>


<p>
Agreed.  Except, of course, there would most likely be a fairly large set of
goals.

<p>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink2">&gt;Then the entity sets up a worldspace in which the entity populates with</a><br>
several
<br>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink3">&gt;copies of itself, which can interact, combine, reproduce by both asexual</a><br>
budding
<br>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink4">&gt;and bisexual intercourse, as well as being able to edit themselves and each</a><br>
<i>&gt;other on a limited basis.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink5">&gt;Entity copies within the worldspace  can grow over time, but if they remain</a><br>
<i>&gt;static they die after a given amount of time. Those that lose various</i><br>
<i>&gt;competetive rankings more often than not die sooner rather than later.</i><br>
These
<br>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink6">&gt;competetive rankings are based loosely on the goals the Entity Prime wishes</a><br>
to
<br>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink7">&gt;attain. Over time, the entities in the world space evolve toward the g</a>oals</a><br>
of
<br>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink8">&gt;the Entity Prime, to the point that those entities which attain the goals</a><br>
of the
<br>
<a href="0759.html#0762qlink9">&gt;Entity Prime can exit the world space. At this time, the Entity Prime can</a><br>
<i>&gt;overwrite itself with Entity(n).</i><br>

<a name="0775qlink1">How about I, Entity Prime (EP) maintain my prime identity and also generate
(let's say) 25 sub-identities whose purposes are to achieve a set of goals
set forth by me at the time I create them?  They are virtual copies except
for the executive functions which only the (EP) holds.  They may
interact and edit themselves but not each other,</a> except through the rational
<a name="0775qlink2">processes of logical and persuasive argumentation.</a>  They may form work
groups/committees to hasten their progress through cooperation.  As time
passes, sub-identities develop diverse attributes and collect specialized
information.   One problem I see, and Doug already addressed this, is that
the
<br>
EP may fall too far behind to recognize and appreciate a truly positive
opportunity for change.  I also doubt that it will be in the best interests
of
<br>
the EP in terms of efficiency to simply integrate all the attributes and all
the specialized information gathered from all of the sub-identities.  So
perhaps the best path toward achieving the stated goals (as well as
determining whether those goals are still worthwhile) is to require a
consensual
<br>
democratic decision on what information will be ultimately be fully
integrated
<br>
into the EP.  This way the EP can not be allowed to unduly retard it's own
evolutionary growth, plus the idea that an evil sub-entity might "fool" the
EP into being overwritten is no longer a problem.  It's no longer a question
of either the EP or the copy surviving.  This kind of group cherry-picking
protocol may be more controlled and stable, but might also allow for a
steadier and more sustained growth.

<p>
This idea is probably an old one, though.  I'm still trying to catch on so
bear with me.
