Abstract
<br>
  Chemoprevention of cancer is a means of cancer control in which the
  occurrence of this disease, as a consequence of exposure to carcinogenic
  agents, can be entirely prevented, slowed, or reversed by the administration
  of one or several naturally occurring or synthetic agents. Thus, the
  chemoprevention of cancer differs from therapy in that the goal of prevention
  is to lower the rate of cancer incidence. Such chemopreventive agents are
  also known as anticarcinogens, and an ideal agent should have (i) little or
  no untoward or toxic effects, (ii) high efficacy against multiple sites,
<br>
  (iii) capability of oral administration, (iv) a known mechanism of action,<br>
  (v) low cost, and (vi) human acceptance. With regard to naturally occurring<br>
  agents, fruits, vegetables, and common beverages, as well as several herbs
  and plants, have been identified as rich sources of cancer chemopreventive
  agents. While a wide range of laboratory studies has identified many
  compounds, including several polyphenols, as cancer chemopreventive agents,
  in this article our main emphasis is on the cancer chemopreventive potential
  of a polyphenolic fraction isolated from green tea and silymarin, a flavonoid
  present in artichoke, against different stages of mouse skin
  multistage carcinogenesis. We also highlight studies related to retinoid
  effects on prevention of human skin cancers. [References: 68]
