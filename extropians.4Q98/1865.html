This would work, assuming everyone had access to the same surveillance data that
the goverment did.  Yet practically speaking, the US government has engaged in
the exact opposite direction.  Not only have they simultaneously increased their
invasion of our private lives and persisted in trying to outlaw strong
encryption, but they have made it as difficult as ever for the average citizen
to gain access to the same data they gather through such surreptitious means.

<p>
Perhaps a system that you outline is evolving now anyway through an increase in
the amount of surveillance camera's (both public and private) that are hooked up
to the internet for all to peek through.
