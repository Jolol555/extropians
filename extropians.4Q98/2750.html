It appears as if you assume I belong the "caring lefties".
If you do, you are in error.  I belong to neither cathegory.

<p>
It is irrelevant that that question had appeared before.

<p>
The question *I* raised was another (albeit related) one:

<p>
    "If the govt did not take money from the population
     and give part of that money to a handicapped person,
    then how would ve get the money to dehandicap verself?"

<p>
Postulates:

<OL>
  <li>  I do not give money to beggars ("causes") today.
  <li>  If the State stopped taxing, (a) would still hold.
  <li>  People in general tend to be slow to change.
Conclusion:
	IF people in general react as I do
	  THEN (1) ve would get less resources
	  ELSE (2) ve would not get less resources.
	Take (c) into the computation, and
	I conclude that (1) is the more probable outcome of the change.


</OL>
<p>
Those who feel that situation (1) does not match their ethics might wish
to address it.  I have no opinion on that matter.

<p>

<p>
It may be true, but the statement is not relevant to the current issue.
