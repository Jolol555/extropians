 I've just started reading this book, and haven't formed an opinion yet. But
what I have noticed, in leaving it lying around the house, is that my housemates
have started reading it. They are new housemates, and are new to this kind of
topic. The book does seem to be stimulating some thoughts about a future that is
different from the past. As such, I consider it has already been worth the
purchase price.
