<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;So what does socialism mean? And is it compatible with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;libertarian ideals? Webster's New International Dictionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;defines a libertarian as "One who holds to the doctrine</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of free will; also, one who upholds the principles of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;liberty, esp. individual liberty of thought and action."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;According to the American Heritage Dictionary "socialism"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is "a social system in which the producers possess both</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;political power and the means of producing and distributing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;goods." This definition fits neatly with the implications</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the word "libertarian" indicated above. In fact, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;shows that socialism is necessarily libertarian, not statist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: The definition of socialism cited observes</i><br>
<i>&gt;   by default that consumers have been deprived of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   political power -- which is held by producers --</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and that consumers have been taken out of the con-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   trol of the distribution of goods; which is exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the case in the socialist, but not libertarian, state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   We can also observe that a definition of libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt;   need only note that * individuals * have political power,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   not that one social subset, such as producers, had power.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   What is more, the idea that producers have power in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   socialist state is false, the central planners have it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a name="0656qlink1">Ian, what seems evident here is that argument by selective definition is
not enough and cannot persuade parties. In this thread, for example,
others would say that politics is about forging and changing coalitions
and that this definition seems to negate the ability of any individual
from having or creating political power without the involvement of
others, as you implied.

<p>
There is this problem with general discourse in a way that likely even a
Platonist would agree that written language is about not being able to
come to agreement and in fact is more about missing perspectives. What I
would hope eventually to see is a collective internet rendering of
presentations that is something even bolder than what crit.org can do.
I'd like to eventually see an elevation of subject matter on the basis
of subjective evaluations of features where, by using say e.g., floating
radio buttons in a sidebar to the subject area, to enable a scoring of
features so that neural net patterns and/or markov-like chains could be
developed and forever remain open to revision. Such an eventual global
valuation of everything via the net is what I foresee. Because my
software development is in this field, this is my expectation of
libertarian socialism.

Until this demarchy is a reality I feel it is a pity to contribute a
wasteful writing of replies to email posts that disappear into a
nothingness of biased meanings.
