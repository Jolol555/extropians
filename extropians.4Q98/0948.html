<a href="0897.html#0948qlink1">&gt;There's a reason why most people do the date that way. It's</a><br>
<i>&gt;because month day year is the way you say the date in English,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and I at least think in English. It is day month year in other</i><br>
<i>&gt;countries probably because that is how it is said in their</i><br>
<i>&gt;language...</i><br>

<p>
That would be American-english (why do so many people in the USA think
<a name="0985qlink1">their english is English?). In Australian english (and English-english?)
its dd-mm-yyyy.</a> I guess we do reverse ISO standard since we are
upside-down.

<p>
Perhaps English should be considered one of the most libertarian of
languages given the way it easily adopts new words and evolves to the users
needs. Though this can cause some confusion: in my first trip to the States
I got some very odd looks in cafes when I asked for a 'long black' - lucky
I wasn't in a gay bar.

<p>
best, patrick
