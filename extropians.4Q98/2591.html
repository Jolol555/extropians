 Hopefully, maybe I will be able to share some experiential insight into the
"metaphorical/alledged higher circuits." There have been ongoing attempts since
time immemorial to create cartographies of trans-rational/personal states of
consciousness. Some of the most popularly known being the chakra system, the
tree of life, Wilber's spectrum model, Adi Da's seven stages of life, and
Leary's eight circuit model. For the sake of brevity I should like to focus on
a current psychopharmacological model. There has been recent interest and
research involving the psychoactive effects of the plant Salvia Divinorum.
Within the last year subjective reports from various experimenters have
confirmed a commonality of both somatic and psychological effects that may be
expected at various dosage levels. Some somatic effects include: a sense that
the body is twisting, flatening, melting into a puddle, becoming part of the
floor, etc. Psychological effects may include disidentification with the usual
boundaries  accepted as defining a sense of personal identity or Self.
Experiences have included though not limited to  an awareness of becoming waves
of consciousness that permeate and include all beings and things.

<p>
Many yogic and magical disciplines include being able to enter into a
trance/dissociative state of awareness where the barrier between the
subconscious and the conscious states of mind appears to be suspended. The
intended goal may generally be described as staying focused while not
identifying with "personal" memories that define an individuality. It would be
during the very intial stages of remembrance/ re-emergence of identity that
renders the concept of metaprogramming the bio-computer possible. These moments
of temporal quasi-identification vulnerability may be classified as "eighth
circuit awareness" by the Leary model which obviously draws on the research of
Dr. John C. Lilly.

<p>
Anyway, my two cents thus far,
