<i>&gt; &gt;I was once so brainwashed, which is why I served in the military. I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;able to break the programming for the most part, and know that the system</i><br>
<i>&gt; is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rotten to the core.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is interesting that people who feel they have been nrainwashed frequently</i><br>
<i>&gt; react in an extreme way to this - hence ex-smokers being vehemntly</i><br>
<i>&gt; anti-smoking and ex-alcholics freuqnelty being the most ant-drinking people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The ex-Christians I know are also the most antireligious people that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know - to the point of irrationality.</i><br>

I am also ex-military; I hunted subs from the air (H-2's, P-3's).  
Military organizations are, by necessity, fascist in nature, for orders 
must be obeyed immediately, without question, for them to be 
efficient in combat.  When you join, you forfeit the constitutional 
rights and freedoms you pledge to protect; you are no longer  
covered by the Constitution, but by the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice (the UCMJ) and its infamous Article 134, the General 
Article, which permits prosecution for anything the military 
authorities believe to be an offense, but which they forgot to mention 
in the other articles.  After a single tour, I got out (although I was 
offered a substantial bonus to re-enlist) because, although I could 
see the necessity of running the military in a nondemocratic 
<a name="3233qlink1">manner, I was (and remain) too much of an individualist to tolerate it
