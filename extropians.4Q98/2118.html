Anders  asked:

<p>
<a href="2041.html#2118qlink1">&gt;Is there any scientific evidence for vitamin C &amp; &gt;B helping cognitive</a><br>
tasks?

<p>
I'm a clinical pharmacist with a personal interest
in noo/psychotropic drugs &amp; nutrient supplements;  the best info I can
find 'only'
<br>
indicates that the drugs &amp; nutrients mentioned 
help prevent deficits in mental function (which is why I use them
prophylactically) in otherwise healthy adults.  Children receiving
vitamin supplements have been shown to score higher on IQ tests, but IMO
this reflects a simple correction of a malnutrition-induced deficit.

<p>
As to the difficulty in separating out the placebo effect with
nootropics, this is all too true;  I haven't found any well-controlled
studies on healthy people &amp; nootropics outside of the ones on caffeine &amp;
amphetamines.   There is some evidence that antianxiety agents such as
low
<br>
dose benzodiazepines &amp; propranolol, a centrally
acting adrenergic receptor blocker, improve test
scores, but again this is not well studied &amp; is most likely a reduction
in noise, not a boost to the signal.  Potentially useful in many
situations,
<br>
I must admit.

<p>
In short, I must conclude there are as yet no
clinically proven nootropics out there yet.  If it works for you,
though, &amp; the cost-benefit estimates work out, results are what matter;
your life, your choice, as it should be.
