It's just wild-eyed idealism.  Genomic modification and neural modification in
infancy are a hell of a lot easier than reversing the modification in
adulthood.  We can't rely on the "we'll be able to reverse it by the time
they're 18" to solve the moral issues.  Plus, I don't think that argument is
correct.  Neuromod will be the real hot-spot issue, and neuromod is almost
impossible to reverse.

<i>&gt; themes.</i><br>

<p>
The writers of Deep Space Nine are not real mutants and know nothing
whatsoever about the cognitive science involved.  Furthermore, their mutants'
goals and personalities are based on normally-intelligent writers' fantasies
of being a superior mutant, and bear no relation to an actual personality
shaped by specialized genius.</a>  If we want to survive, we will need to react on
the basis of fact rather than 50 years of bad TV.
