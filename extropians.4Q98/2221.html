Now why would you wish that fate on me?

<i>&gt; edutainment.</i><br>

<p>
Oh of course. It used to be even here in public schools that the dregs were subtly
encouraged to drop out when they ceased to find any use in school. Now every kid
HAS to graduate or mummy and daddy want to sue the school for breach of contract or
negligence or what have you. Evaluation of faculty evaluation stats is a tricky
game. If the kids don't study much, get low grades, and hate the teacher, then the
teacher is doing his or her job, unless those kids don't have a history of the same
behavior. when the kids study a lot, but still get bad grades and hate the teacher
indicates that the teacher is lacking somewhere.

<i>&gt; education to be able to succeed in college. Na, that's too easy.</i><br>

I had excellent SAT scores (640 v, 720 m), but only a B average. My study skills
were pathetic, which was a major impediment in college. Many teachers will focus
their classes toward preparing for the SAT.

<p>
One major problem is that too many kids get straight A averages taking gut courses
like basket weaving, simple math, science and social science courses, and lots of
art and phys ed classes. I got a C- in calculus the first time I took it ( it was a
7 am class with a teacher who talked like Ben Stein, and I've got narcoleptic
tendencies....) and my GPA was screwed, but kids who were still taking Algebra or
Trig their senior year and got A+'s sat ahead of me at graduation....
