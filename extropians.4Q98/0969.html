Wow Ken!  Feeling a little ambitious this evening are we.  I can answer
half your question (the biology half).  Maybe some well meaning physist can
answer the other half.  I'm not up to speed on quantum teleportaion
devices, but I know the theory behind them.  For any computational
structure that is possible, you could certainly build it in a living
creature as protein sequences (and if its protein you can code for it with
DNA).  The technology is not here yet, we still have the infamous protein
folding problem to overcome befor this is possible.  The only limiting
problem (excluding current technological limitations), as you have pointed
out, is size.  There are a very large number of variables involved in the
transmission of signals from a single neuron so this might get to be a
large piece of protein hardware (not just a simple on/off transmission). 
<a name="0970qlink1">You do realize that current quantum teleportation techniques still require
a convential EM signal to transmit half the message though, right?  Or have
things changed recently?</a>

<a name="0970qlink2">P.S,  Why would you want to monitor every single neuron in someone at a
distance?  Maybe have an extension of yourself in many places at one time?</a> 
OOH AHH, I like it!
