<p>
Actually, they have not been exonerated. They have been granted new trials or
granted clemency or pardoned. That is a far cry from exonerated. Usually the
only reason they were granted new trials was because of a technicality, not
that they didn't do it. If they are granted a new trial, but the evidence
against them is so old as to be useless, especially if key witnesses are dead,
it can be hard to reconvict someone who may really be guilty, so many times
the prosecutors decide to not go for a new trial, so the killers just get off.

<p>
Ususally this happens if the crook has served more than the average sentence
already for the crime by the time he or she is granted a new trial, so the
prosecutor figures that if they can't reconvict them its not a big deal since
he or she has served that amount of time anyways. Though this doesn't happen
often during election season.
