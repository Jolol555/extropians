Yes. You seem to be getting it. You do realise that this is a list full of
anarchists, don't</a> you? I don't particularly care about "improving"
<a name="2519qlink2">government because I dislike all forms of government; admittedly there
are a bunch of libertarians on the list who believe in extremely limited
government (e.g. defence, etc),</a> but I don't believe that's possible. OTOH
were the US Constitution actually enforced I'd be almost as happy to live
under that as in an anarchy.

That sounds exactly like modern Statism.

Now, go and read David Friedman's work on Anarcho-capitalism and get
back to us. Just to make life easy, you can start at www.best.com/~ddfr.

<a name="2512qlink1">BTW, I'm surprised that no-one has mentioned his new book (on the Web)
about the economics of law in recent discussions; I've only skimmed bits
of it, but it seems to have a lot of useful points to make.
