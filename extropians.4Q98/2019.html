Surprise! I used to be a supporter of the Death Penalty until I read Robert Anton's Wilson's Book
"Cosmic Trigger" in which he adamantly opposed the death penalty for the person who killed his
daughter.  Consequently, one of my closest friends also argued to spare the life of a person
convicted of killing his Fiancé.

<p>
However, your observation is *not* remarkable at all.  I highly suspect that most people who are
against the death penalty will change sides as soon as one of their own is murdered.  This is not
proof of their rationality, only proof that they are operating on a primitive emotional-terretorial
circuit's need for vengeance.</a>

<p>
I agree with Michael Lorrey, that a "well armed society is a polite society" - that's why I own two
guns myself.  Lets be clear about one thing,  I am against state sponsored executions, but I
strongly support the the right of an individual to defend themselves by any means necessary.  One is
done for irrational vengeance, the other is done as a matter of immediate survival.
