Given that its a thought experiment you are presumably able to keep the two
brains identical indefinitely. However in the real world I would have
thought chaotic factors would ensure that the two brains diverged very
rapidly. Even if you have two identical brains to begin with small external
differences would be enough to ensure divergence. I suspect that even small
gravitational differences between the two rooms would be enough. And of
course random quantum effects between the two brains would be different
which would also lead to divergence.
