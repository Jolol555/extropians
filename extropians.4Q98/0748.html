Hi everyone,
<br>
I'm wading my way -slowly- through Tipler at the moment.
with no formation in maths, and only a little formal logic (years ago as
an undergrad)
<br>
I'm finding it quite hard going.
<br>
I tried -unsuccessfully to date- to read Penrose (i know he has no
fundamental affinity with the questions which occupy us here, but I
thought it might serve as a good foil/counterpoint to the boyish
enthusiasm I'm experiencing for extropian ideas)
Funnily enough, Tipler is illuminating what I found quite opaque in
Penrose on Turing machines.

<p>
<a name="0758qlink1">question: could someone please try to explain to me -in terms adapted to
the level of mathmatical aptitude suggested by foregoing- the proof
offered by Tipler on p.26 of Physics of immortality, that is, the
argument he offers to prove that the Halting problem is unsolvable.</a>

<p>
I am aware of how basic my concerns are, but I really do have enough
enthusiasm to make up for initial maths defecit, that is, if you folks
are willing to help me from time to time.

<p>
anyway, all the best.
<br>
