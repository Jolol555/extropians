While the objective of building a petaflop machine isn't
new, here's some information I happened upon on the PR Newswire
concerning progress towards the machine. I'm including a portion
of the article since there is no URL:

3-D Transistor Key Enabling Technology to be Demonstrated 

<p>
"COSTA MESA, Calif., Sept. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Irvine Sensors<br>
Corporation (Nasdaq: IRSN, Boston: ISC) announced today that
it has received an approximate $738,000 research and development 
contract from the United States Army Space and Missile Defense 
Command to demonstrate the feasibility of an ultra high density 
interconnect to enhance its 3D Artificial Neural Network(TM) 
(3DANN(TM)) technology. The new interconnect is part of Irvine 
Sensors' planned progression of technologies intended to eventually 
lead to a "Silicon Brain," a recognition system conceived to emulate 
performance of the human central nervous system. The Army's interest 
in such technology is for potential application to ballistic missile 
defense systems. Irvine Sensors believes that human-level recognition 
technology could also have commercial applications in such fields as 
medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, radiography, security systems, 
and speech recognition. Optical displays are also expected to benefit 
from the three-dimensional active transistor interconnect technology 
to be developed under the new contract."

<p>
"The problem being addressed by the Silicon Brain development can be <br>
compared to that faced by a football quarterback who, when confronting 
multiple threats and opportunities simultaneously, must take 
instantaneous and decisive action. During missile defense, events 
unfold even faster, and the threats and opportunities are much greater 
in number. What you'd like is human-level intuitive responsiveness, but 
at higher speeds and typically under adverse, humanly-impossible 
conditions," said John C. Carson, Irvine Sensors' Sr. Vice President 
and Chief Technical Officer. "Although it will take several years 
before the technology can be made available for products, we believe 
the Silicon Brain will ultimately be able to solve that problem... 
attaining petaflop performance, or quadrillions of operations per 
second, using less than ten watts of power, in one-third of a cubic 
foot, or about the size of a shoebox. This will be the same volumetric 
efficiency as the human brain."
