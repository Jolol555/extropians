What a wonderful suggestion.  I read this book 10 or 12 years ago when I
was in my late 20's and it was a life changer for me.  I cannot believe
that I didn't think of it when looking for gifts for my nephews and
neices this christmas.  Well, I guess they will all get a late gift if I
can round up enough copies.

Thanks for the jog to my memory.
