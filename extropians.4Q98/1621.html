Unfortunately, while this will transfer a lot of petroleum economy 
wealth from the Christians to the Pagans, it still does nothing to 
clear up traffic on the parking lot freeways.

If you want to get the roads clear, you need to eliminate moo-cow's 
need to drive to Blockbuster to pick up their VHS tape and DVDs.  
AOL's 15fps 120x90 mpeg clips scaled up to NTSC via a Wintel set-top 
box just aren't going to cut the mustard.

<p>
O.K., AOL's new Sun Microsystems wavelet compressed Blockbuster 
library might do a whole lot of good for lining Steve Case's 
Arlington Virginia CIA snoopshop wallet, but will we be getting frame 
level access at a decent price?  I seriously doubt it.

<p>
Just another 5-10 years of planned obsolecence while Ma Bell 
continues to butt-fuck American consumers while sleeping with 
Rockefeller-inspired oil monopolies who try to suck the last penny 
from every living creature while smogging up the skyline, just so 
when their finished they can poison the water supply or Nuke their 
<a name="1638qlink1">own populace in the name of National Security.  I'm sure the Neutron 
bomb development programs continued perfectly uninterrupted over at 
General Electric.</a>  Good news, Philips just announced a light bulb 
<a name="1648qlink1">that lasts for 2 years.  Oh joy.  Maybe in 2015 they'll spill the 
beans on their 1968 patented lightbulb that lasts 200 years.</a>

<p>
Joy.  AOL buys Netscape for $4 Billion in a 3 way cluster fuck 
partnership with Sun Microsystems.  Bill Gates gets competition.  
Bullshit.  More like petroleum economy slavery scheduled to continue 
for another 20 years, before the scheduled mass genocide starts.

<p>
Let's just start handing out the RU486, Viagra, and MDMA and get this 
over with.
