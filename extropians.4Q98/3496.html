<p>
 It's a case of who is the most commited (obviously, there is a balance
with other factors), and how much you want to put into victory.

<p>
  But I would thing guerilla is the very last barrier of defence, if you
may call it so. It's really when everything goes havoc. And I'm sure
there are ways to attack a guerilla army, anybody know about that???


<p>
   Dien Bien Phu was not a guerilla battle. It was a straight battle
between two armies. Only the vietnamese (with the help of china) managed
to use artillery contrary to the plans of french generals (they made a
road right through the jungle to bring their canons to the heavily
fortified camp).
