To counter this, people might support the passage of regs saying that only
those ailments for which there is an affordable cure can be used as grounds for
denial of coverage for pre-existing or DNA screened conditions. This would
certainly be an incentive for drug companies to invest in more medical
research....

Tell me, how in the hell does your tax money subsidize my not wearing a seat
belt? If you are talking about medicare support for the disabled, its your own
fault for choosing to live in a political unit which has such an insurance
system which you must pay into and is full of people who are not anal retentive
wenies like yourself. If you don't like it go found the Anal Retentive Republic
and set things up as you like them. I certainly don't want my tax</a> dollars
supporting your neuroses about other people's behavior, or the fascist state
you want to turn our country into to force everyone to act the way you want
them to.
