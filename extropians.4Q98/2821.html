(which

it

which

And Microsoft says "Fuck all of them.  Anyone for Windows 2000"
Most people don't think enough to look up the past record of a company .
They don't care enough to look at the enviromental record.
They don't give a damn about Microsoft forcing businesses to only carry
their borwser or locking ISP's into carrying their products.
They care abstractly, but when it comes down to it, most people don't look
more than 6 inches beyond their nose, or 3 inches beyond the next bargain.
