<a name="1907qlink1">I'll try hard to restrain my genetically-mandated imperative as a parent
to immediately hassle you with gratuitous advice. :-) Instead, I'll
ask for some: What advice can I offer my kids about ethical behaviour?
I can't tell them to follow the golden rule because God told them to,
but I'm not really comfortable with "I've got mine, tough luck losers"
either. Mostly, we go with the concept that helping society as a whole
is worthwhile because we are going to have to live in it, So being good
citizens is appropriate in the same sense that not polluting is appropriate.

<p>
Other people's answers are appreciated, but I'd really like to hear fom Erin.
