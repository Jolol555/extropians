<a href="2934.html#2976qlink1">&gt; On a related note; comic books.  Have any of you ever read a comic book</a><br>
<i>&gt; series called Mircle Man (previously published as Marvel Man in the UK</i><br>
<i>&gt; several decades ago) published by Eclipse Comics?  The first half of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; series was written by Alan Moore, the second half by Neil Gaiman (writer</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Sandman comics). Extremely strong extropian themes. Does anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a series that they think fits extropian/transhumanist ideas?</i><br>

Yes- "Madman" by Mike Allred, published by Dark Horse. Older issues
published by Kitchen Sink. Very fun and positive. The lead character,
Madman, is named Frank Einstein.<a name="3035qlink1"> He knows he died and was brought back to
</a>
life by another character in the series, a mad-scientist type, but he can't
remember his previous life. Chock-full of wacky robots and hi-jinx, campy
violence and gorgeous art.
