<p>
First of all, this conversation is pretty tangential to the original thread.
And
<br>
I should note that I personally treasure my privacy and would fight tooth
and
<br>
nail to defend it.

<p>
Nevertheless, I will say that I suspect your definition of human nature must
differ from my own.  Secondly, you're suddenly talking about a "community"
of people seeking freedom from oppression (a very good thing), and
calling that a need for privacy.  Group splinterings are conceptually
different from
<br>
individual privacy in my mind.  Besides, I suspect that Puritans (and any
other
<br>
group with a strict and inflexible set of mores) were highly vigilant and
became
<br>
quite suspicious when any of their members sought an unusual amount of
privacy.  (He's probably consorting with satan!)

<p>
<a href="1038.html#1044qlink6">&gt;This scenario is nothing new.  If it wasn't for people ability to establish</a><br>
<i>&gt;privacy they wouldn't have been able to evolve as they wanted to for fear</i><br>
of
<br>
<a href="1038.html#1044qlink7">&gt;being burnt at the stake or sacrificed to the local god.  I'd say privacy</a><br>
is
<br>
<a href="1038.html#1044qlink8">&gt;definitely hard-wired into peoples brains, especially those of us whose</a><br>
<i>&gt;ancestors had to overcome great pressures of social conformity.</i><br>


<p>
Wouldn't it follow from this argument that those who sought to establish
privacy had a greater risk of being killed than those who did not?  And
wouldn't that suggest that those with a strong need for individual privacy
were less likely to pass their genes on?

<p>
I still think that a population's need for individual privacy is primarily a
function of cultural factors and things like population density.  As for
genetic predispositions, I suspect that we're "wired" to socialize more so
than we are to be alone, but I also like Ardrey's notion (. . . that enmity
and
<br>
amity are innate and result in [effective] human cooperative systems).
I can see the need for balance early in our development.

<p>
So here's a question:

<p>
Throughout history, have there been no cultures where no real value
is attributed individual privacy?
