<a name="1232qlink1">So how does this compare to a child who sees hundreds of his or her neighbors
slaughtered in front of them by government or guerrilla thugs? Also, how does
this compare to children who grow up on farms where animals are slaughtered as
an everyday practice? How about to a child whose parents are abusing each other
and their children on a daily basis? I'm sure that compared to a baby raised in
a bubble there may be a difference, but compared to children raised in the real
world, not in the suburban fantasy land, I doubt that there is much difference.
Making suburban kids aware that the rest of the world does not grow up in their
saccharine way of life may even be of benefit to them when they leave their
cocoons...</a>

Any show that glorifies the perpetrators of violence would obviously have a
suggestive impact for the negative. However the perpetrators are almost always
defeated by normal people meeting fire with fire, which is a rational, logical,
real world solution to agressors like Saddam Hussein or the local gang banger.
