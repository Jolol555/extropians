Ok, given all of that, is there a point in going forward with cryonics
<a name="2150qlink1">considering that I live in North Carolina?  Are there any facilities
anywhere nearby?</a>

<i>&gt; An initial note: Compared to many other things you can spend your</i><br>
money on,
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink4">&gt; getting cryonics arrangements funded can be very affordable,</a><br>
especially if you

Furthermore, there
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink6">&gt; are scaling effects for cryonics: The more people that do it, the more</a><br>
<i>&gt; affordable and realistic the whole enterprise becomes.  Creating</i><br>
such a
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink7">&gt; structure through the voluntary choice of participants seems to me</a><br>
to be a
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink8">&gt; VERY extropian activity.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  I haven't been convinced yet that it's a "good thing."  I</i><br>
understand
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink9">&gt; &gt;  the basic arguments for it, and yes, I want to live a long, long</a><br>
time
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink10">&gt; &gt;  just like the next transhuman.  However, I have concerns and</a><br>
doubts...
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink11">&gt; &gt;  1) How long can I be legally dead and still retain my brain state</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  (identity)?  I live in North Carolina and I doubt there's any</i><br>
Cryonics
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink12">&gt; &gt;  centers nearby.  If I'm gonna be suspended then dammit, I better be</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  there when I'm thawed out, not some brain damaged version of me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm no technical expert, so I only have personal, subjective</i><br>
opinions and
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink13">&gt; value judgments to offer.  My ultimate opinion on this question is</a><br>
based on
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink14">&gt; observations of my own changing identity over time, both in the</a><br>
short run and
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink15">&gt; the long run.  I find that my "brain state" varies so much even over</a><br>
the short
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink16">&gt; period of a few days -- yet with a continuing sense of identity --</a><br>
that I
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink17">&gt; would want to be "revived" even if the entity thus created shared</a><br>
only a small
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink18">&gt; fraction of its identity with "me" (now).  When I consider how</a><br>
different I am
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink19">&gt; from the "me" I was even a few years ago -- much less the "me" of my</a><br>
childhood
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink20">&gt; -- my opinion on the subject becomes even stronger.</a><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  2) I'm almost 30 now.  I fully expect to live at least to 2040 and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  hopefully 2050.  What are the chances we won't have developed</i><br>
mature
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink21">&gt; &gt;  nanotechnology by then?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If by "mature nanotechnology" you mean things like "utility fog", I</i><br>
think the
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink22">&gt; chances are far less than 50%.  (I do think the chances are MUCH</a><br>
better that
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink23">&gt; we'll have very potent "early nanotech" by then, though.  I think</a><br>
we're likely
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink24">&gt; to see the earliest "nanotech" -- diamondoid thread and ribbon -- in</a><br>
c. 5
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink25">&gt; years, for what it's worth.)</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; More important than "mature nanotech" per se will be the many</i><br>
incremental
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink26">&gt; developments in molecular biology which, by 2010 even will have</a><br>
added a decade
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink27">&gt; to your life span, IMHO.  However, such a realization shouldn't</a><br>
undermine
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink28">&gt; commitment to cryonics now.  First, you can't be sure you won't</a><br>
contract some
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink29">&gt; kind of disease or develop some kind of condition for which a cure</a><br>
is just
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink30">&gt; over your personal horizon and second, you may well be involved in</a><br>
some sort
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink31">&gt; of accident for which cryonics will be a necessary safety net.</a><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  3) If I name a Cryonics organization as a beneficiary of life</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  insurance in order to secure financing for freezing and I expire in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  such a way that I'm not salvageable (explosion, acid, eaten,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  spontaneous combustion, alien abduction, lost at sea, etc.) is</i><br>
there a
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink32">&gt; &gt;  clause to divert the money to my family?  </a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; From a technical legal standpoint, you COULD have such a clause in</i><br>
your
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink33">&gt; insurance policy.  As a practical matter, though, I think it is</a><br>
unlikely that
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink34">&gt; you could get this into a policy you could actually buy.  The</a><br>
problem would be
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink35">&gt; crafting language for a contingent beneficiary clause that would</a><br>
define a
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink36">&gt; certain enough condition to trigger the payment to the contingent</a><br>
<i>&gt; beneficiaries.  Language to the effect "in case my brain is so</i><br>
damaged that
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink37">&gt; cryonic suspension is not practical, then pay my kids" keys off of a</a><br>
condition
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink38">&gt; that would be determined by reference to 1) a changing state of the</a><br>
art and 2)
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink39">&gt; potentially differing expert opinion about what would be a</a><br>
sufficiently
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink40">&gt; damaged brain state.  We're lucky enough that a few financially</a><br>
solid life
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink41">&gt; insurers are willing to write cryonics insurance (most won't);</a><br>
inserting this
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink42">&gt; added uncertainty into the claims process is something the very</a><br>
conservative
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink43">&gt; life insurance industry simply won't tolerate.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Consider that the insurance benefit that will fund a neuro</i><br>
suspension --
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink44">&gt; $50,000 -- is really a VERY small amount of life insurance.  If you</a><br>
have a
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink45">&gt; real need for life insurance for economic dependants who will still</a><br>
be in that
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink46">&gt; state at the time of your death, $50,000 is not very helpful. </a><br>
Furthermore,
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink47">&gt; cryonics arrangements stand in lieu of traditional burial, so one</a><br>
gets at
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink48">&gt; least some offsetting cost savings there.  Thus for most people, the</a><br>
<i>&gt; "misdirected benefit" issue in the case of an impossible suspension</i><br>
is a
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink49">&gt; negligible economic issue.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, consider the actual dollar present cost of cryonics</i><br>
arrangements.  I
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink50">&gt; made my arrangements when I was 39, and locked my premium in at just</a><br>
under
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink51">&gt; $1,200 per year (and I have a sub-optimal underwriting profile). </a><br>
The annual
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink52">&gt; dues for Alcor are $360 (if I recall correctly).  The less than</a><br>
$1,500 per
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink53">&gt; year I pay for my cryonics arrangements is one of the better values</a><br>
I buy, in
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink54">&gt; my opinion. In a recent case of a friend who is 28 and healthy, I</a><br>
saw an
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink55">&gt; annual premium of about $400 for a whole body suspension ($125,000</a><br>
death
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink56">&gt; benefit).  That means that the total cost is under $800 per year. </a><br>
My guess is
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink57">&gt; that the total neuro cost would be under $500 per year for a healthy</a><br>
person in
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink58">&gt; their 20s.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  4) Is life insurance even Transhuman?  I'm betting I'll die</i><br>
before my
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink59">&gt; &gt;  family does.  The whole point of being transhuman is that I DON'T</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  WANNA DIE!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  I'd almost rather spend the money on staying healthy -</i><br>
supplements, etc.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink60">&gt; I don't want to die either, but I wear a seat belt in my car and see</a><br>
that it
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink61">&gt; is equipped with airbags, being willing to pay the cost and take the</a><br>
time to
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink62">&gt; use these safety devices.  Investing in a cryonics contract is</a><br>
simply an
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink63">&gt; action of the same kind: devoting current resources to a safety</a><br>
device; it is
<br>
<a href="2117.html#2130qlink64">&gt; a species of risk-shifting, all of which involves some current costs.</a><br>
