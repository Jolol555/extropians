<p>
Stop right there. You're arguing for a contradiction. By definition, a
regulated market is not a free market - unless you're referring to
*self-regulation*, which doesn't appear to be the case.

<p>
The objectives you cite for regulation of the economy, insofar as they are
legitimate, can all be met by the allocation mechanism of the market
itself: that, of course, is the basic claim of anarcho-capitalism.

<p>
Or if you're afraid of too much freedom, a minimalist will argue that tort
law or criminal law, administered by a greatly reduced "government", will
take care of fraud, theft and the like, with no need to intrude into the
workings of the market itself.

<p>
The bottom line is: freedom and coercion don't mix. A "little" regulation
turns a free market into a managed market, with all the attendant problems.</a>

<p>
<a href="3151.html#3155qlink2">&gt;You, however, deflected my question rather than answer it.</a><br>

<p>
I wasn't the one you asked the question of, but I'll be glad to give you my
answer:

<p>
<a href="3151.html#3155qlink3">&gt;To repeat; are you in favor of corporate welfare or not, and, in either</a><br>
case, why?

<p>
In a word: no. I don't believe in any sort of "government"-provided
"welfare". Why? Because it's based on coercion of some to benefit others.

<p>
I don't think Mike was supporting corporate welfare either; he was merely
pointing out that a lot of what gets confusedly called "corporate welfare"
is nothing of the sort, merely a reduction in the amount extorted from a
company, analogously to personal tax deductions.
