<i>&gt; &gt;interacting with their "peers" I point out that it's irrelevant.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a name="2603qlink9">Listen, unless the kid is in the Alaskan outback, he or she is gonna have
neighbors, siblings, and or cousins to socialize with on a regular basis.
Schools are not meant for socialization, otherwize there would</a> be regular tea
<a name="2603qlink10">times through the day. They have been adapted to the job, poorly,</a> because too
<a name="2603qlink11">many parents avoid their responsibilties to their kids</a> and want  professional
<a name="2603qlink12">nursemaids or chaperones. A kid does not need to do mundane things</a> or just hang
<a name="2603qlink13">out to learn socialization. Socialization can just as easily happen in an
academically challenging environment as a matter of course without</a> having to
<a name="2603qlink14">dedicate 'quality time' to it. The interesting thing about socialization</a> in an
<a name="2603qlink15">academically challenging situation is the supposed 'geeks' tend to shine,</a> as
<a name="2603qlink16">opposed to being dominated by the dumb jocks.</a>

<a href="2309.html#2328qlink2">&gt; &gt;By that I mean.....why teach  children to interact with children?</a><br>
<i>&gt; Childhood</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is a temporary thing...the remainder of their lives they will be dealing</i><br>
<i>&gt; with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;adults.  Why not teach children to deal with adults to begin with and be</i><br>
<i>&gt; done</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with it?</i><br>

<p>
As a child I dealt with adults much better than with my peers. At age 12 I
could easily have substantive discussions on world events with a whole group of
my parent's peers.

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<a href="2309.html#2328qlink3">&gt; &gt;Yes...I know...look at all the things they would miss by not interacting</a><br>
<i>&gt; with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their peers.....like drugs...bullies...teenage pregnancy...and other such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;character building experiences..</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you trying to raise these children to follow some particular agenda you</i><br>
<i>&gt; hace?  Or are you just trying to stop them having fun?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I had much more fun when I was not being bullied by idiots or being rejected by
bimbos at school. Getting locked in a locker for two hours as a freshman is not
a character building experience.
