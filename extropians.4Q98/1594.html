<i>&gt;On the surface it sounds like a good idea to eliminate the victimless</i><br>
crimes
<br>
<a href="1588.html#1594qlink1">&gt;from the law, like drug abuse etc. But what about something like the</a><br>
traffic
<br>
<a href="1588.html#1594qlink2">&gt;laws, where there is no wictim at first for driving without a license or in</a><br>
<i>&gt;other recless ways. Certainly more people will be killed or maimed. Isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;this a too high price to pay for the added freedom? I havn't made my mind</i><br>
up
<br>
<i>&gt;yet.</i><br>


<p>
No one is necessarily arguing for the abolition of traffic laws. In a
libertarian society these would be set by private owners under arrangement
with insurers etc. The argument about traffic laws is really about how good
a job the government is doing in setting the most cost-efficient
incentives/disincentives to trade lower accident costs against higher
inconvenience to drivers taking into account the effect on a usually
distorted automobile insurance/health insurance market, and whether private
ownership regimes can tackle these tradeoffs better.
