<a name="2790qlink1">I did some number crunching.  Using the G7 economic data, I ran a
covariance analysis on Matlab and my least mean squares estimate
showed:

<p>
1% GDP more spending
<br>
  --&gt; 0.35% higher unemployment<br>
  --&gt; -$196 purchasing power per capita<br>

<p>
1% GDP more taxation
<br>
  --&gt; 0.44% higher unemployment<br>
  --&gt; -$334 purchasing power per capita (before taxes)</a><br>

<p>
correlations
<pre>
  0.94 spending-unemployment
 -0.41 spending-purchasing
  0.96 taxation-unemployment
 -0.60 taxation-purchasing

</pre>
<p>
Now I made some faux pas--comparing % of GDP of 1996 with unemployment
in 1998.  But still, if you look at the taxation burden chart on:

<p>
<a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/budget99/guide/guide02.html">http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/budget99/guide/guide02.html</a>

<p>
You'll notice the G7 data doesn't change that dramatically.
Unemployment rates, growth, % of GDP.  These don't change that
dramatically over time.

<p>
Lessons:

<p>
-US and Japan are the least socialist.  They also have the lowest
  unemployment figures.  Japan is entering its 3rd year of recession--
  basically the direct result of government intervention.

<p>
-France, Germany, Italy are the most socialist.  They typically have
  double-digit unemployment (in contradiction to the OECD data I found,
  Germany reportedly has an actual unemployment rate of nearly 11%).

<p>
-Canada has grown more and more socialist, and it's unemployment has been
  8+% compared to the US's below 5% as of recent year.  Canada has been
  growing slower, and has significantly less purchasing power than the US.

<p>
-United Kingdown under Thatcher/Major has been reducing its tax burden.
  Not surprisingly, it has been outperforming the continent, thought not
  by all that much.

<p>
You can look up the 1997 G7+Russia data on the US State Department:

<p>
Observe that the more socialist a nation is, the higher its
unemployment rate, and in general the less wealthy it is.
