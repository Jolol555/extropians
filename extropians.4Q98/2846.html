<p>
How about globally coordinated assistance from voluntary charities?

<p>
Coordination doesn't imply coercion.

<p>
In the absence of voluntary charities, the Central Americans could
have bought disaster insurance from other countries that are not
likely to be devastated by the same hurricane.  If the price of such
insurance is too high...  Well, nobody makes people settle and breed
in places that are way too risky.

<p>
The fact that currently coordination is provided by governments
doesn't mean that nobody else can play this role.  The faster the
governments retreat from this function, the sooner alternative
non-coercive regulation methods will appear.

<p>
Internet has hundreds of thousands of regulatory systems, smoother
operation, and doesn't rely on coercive collection of funds...
