<a href="0624.html#0634qlink1">&gt; Let's ask the question this way:  Most people would say that we don't have the</a><br>
<i>&gt; right to modify a genome, or perform neurosurgery, to increase intelligence. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose a mutation arises naturally containing that modification.  Should he</i><br>

<i>&gt; Can an improved version be engineered de novo?</i><br>

<p>
In this case there is an important extra piece of information: a subject
who already has experienced some form of alteration or enhancement, and
likes it.  He wants to pass it on to his offspring, which will tend to
happen naturally if it is genetically based, and could be arranged to
happen artificially in any case.

<p>
Perhaps we can generalize and say that modifications of unborn children
are OK as long as most people who had received such modifications were
happy about it.  This is not a perfect generalization, in that there
might be a situation where someone liked a trait and wanted his kids to
have it, but most people with that trait hated it.  In that case we might
question the wisdom of passing it on.

<p>
This does not help much when we propose to impose a modification for
the first time, since there are no others we can poll who have the mod.
In that case we might adopt a policy of gradualism, combined with
consensual physical modifications.  Let's see a population of people
satisfied to have their legs surgically removed before we decide to have
children born without them.

<p>
Gradualism will be more difficult in some cases, like turning feet into
hands, or John Clark's human bags of hydrogen gas living on Jupiter
(giving new meaning to "fire in the belly"?).  Even then it may be
possible to make the changes incremental by using some imagination.

<p>
BTW I always try to split this kind of question up into two parts.
The first is, is it wise and proper to make modifications to your
unborn children in this way?  In other words, if someone came to you
and asked your advice about whether they should do it, would you
say that it is a good idea.  We approach the question on an individual
level and try to decide what approaches would be best, from a moral
and ethical perspective.

<p>
Once that is done, you can pull back and look at it from society's point
of view.  Should coercion be used to enforce this morality?  Think of
murder, which most people agree is wrong on a personal level, and they
are so sure of their feelings that they feel comfortable enforcing this
prohibition on everyone.

<p>
It seems to me that cases where the proper path is fuzzy or unclear
at the individual level should be the last ones where society decides
to employ coercion.  If I don't know what is the right thing to do,
I certainly shouldn't be telling you  what to do.  So it is important
to analyze the individual case carefully in order to both decide what
is the ethically proper course, and also how much certainty we can
have about it.
