Which is really strange, because capitalism has nothing to do with the 
economic failures in those countries. The problems in Asia and Russia are
largely due to cronyism and to IMF interference. Just as the FDIC caused 
the S&amp;L disaster in the US ('Hey guys, don't worry about bad loans, we'll
cover anything you lose'), the IMF ('Hey, why don't you make high-risk
investments in all these unstable countries, we'll pay you back if it all
goes wrong') caused the Asian and Russian collapse.</a>

*ALL* government activities are funded by taxes taken from individuals at
gunpoint. Or would you continue to work there if everyone refused to pay
taxes and you were no longer paid?</a>

Damn right. Something must be done about all those businesses staging
armed assaults on churches and then burning them down to "save the
children". Something must be done about all those corporate executives
committing perjury in sexual harassment cases and escaping justice with
the full support of the media.

<p>
And, BTW, if you're talking about drug tests and the like, who forced
those businesses to impose those tests? Oh, it was the government with
it's "war on drugs", wasn't</a> it?

<p>
Why? If a business messes you around you can go to one of their competitors
or start your own business. You have no such choice with the government.
