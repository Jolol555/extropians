Hardly. With a database of every citizens DNA, the authorities can convict
anyone they want of any crime they want now. Sequence up some of your DNA
and sprinkle it around a crime scene. With computer technologies they can
fabricate whatever photographic or video evidence they wish.</a> between the
two there is no jury that would not convict you. With secret warrants and
subpoeneas allowed habeus corpus no longer exits. With the good ol' UN
Rights Commision declaring that humans have no right to defend themselves,
there goes the second amendment in the rest of the NWO. With parallel
criminal and civil convictions and property seizures, double jeopardy and
bans against cruel and unusual punishment are banished. With no penalty
for police shooting innocent people there goes accountability ot the
public. How much more do we need?
