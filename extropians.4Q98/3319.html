Any sarcasm, I think, is aimed at the irrationality of believing in
prophecy in the first place.  What little experience I have with the
wording of Nostrodamus' prophecies shows me that they are pretty open
to individual interpretation.  I think most of us Extropians could
probably write vague and ominent sounding prophecies that someone
would find, in a few hundred years or so, to be just as valid as
Nostrodamus'.  

<p>
Rational thought, or at least the attempt of same, is important to the
Extropian Principles.  There is no room for Nostrodamus in rational
thought.  I'm afraid that if you taught yourself the original language
Nostro used (I don't think it was English) and then read his
prophecies in their original forms, you'd see that he had no actual
foresight at all.

<p>
Believing in Nostro, to me, is akin to staring at the sides of
buildings or breakfast pastries to try to catch a glimpse of a holy
virgin.  If you're being made fun of, it's because most of us prefer
rational thought over the mysticism of prophecy.
