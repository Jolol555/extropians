I'll take a crack at this.

<p>
I would refer you to the Cryonics FAQ provided at the various web sites
of the cryonics orgs but here's some short responses to your concerns.

<p>
<a href="1924.html#1934qlink2">&gt;1) How long can I be legally dead and still retain my brain state</a><br>
<i>&gt;(identity)?  I live in North Carolina and I doubt there's any Cryonics</i><br>
<i>&gt;centers nearby.  If I'm gonna be suspended then dammit, I better be</i><br>
<i>&gt;there when I'm thawed out, not some brain damaged version of me.</i><br>


<p>
Clearly, the sooner you're suspended the better.  I've been told 
that there's relatively little damage in the first few hours especially 
if you're iced down, but the decay process does accelerate as 
time passes.  If no steps are taken within 24 hours, it's probably 
too late.  You need to determine if there's a cryonics technician
in your area that will be alerted, and you need to make sure you
have an agreeable physician and possibly a mortician that will
work in conjunction with your cryonics org's protocols.

<p>
Keep in mind that the more damaged brains may simply 
have to wait a little longer for greater advances in bio-technology,
but I can't imagine our revivers knowingly reanimating individuals
with significant brain damage.

<p>
<a href="1924.html#1934qlink3">&gt;2) I'm almost 30 now.  I fully expect to live at least to 2040 and</a><br>
<i>&gt;hopefully 2050.  What are the chances we won't have developed mature</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology by then?</i><br>


<p>
I'm not sure I understand your question, but it sounds like you're 
saying, "Nanotech will probably arrive before I die, so cryonics 
won't be necessary."   In the first place, I wouldn't bet on it.  In 
the second place, what happens if you deanimate next month?

<p>
<a name="2121qlink1"><a href="1924.html#1934qlink4">&gt;3) If I name a Cryonics organization as a beneficiary of life</a><br>
<i>&gt;insurance in order to secure financing for freezing and I expire in</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a way that I'm not salvageable (explosion, acid, eaten,</i><br>
<i>&gt;spontaneous combustion, alien abduction, lost at sea, etc.) is there a</i><br>
<i>&gt;clause to divert the money to my family?  </i><br>


<p>
No problem. They only get the money if they suspend you.  
Check out their contracts.</a>

<p>
<a href="1924.html#1934qlink5">&gt;4) Is life insurance even Transhuman?  I'm betting I'll die before my</a><br>
<i>&gt;family does.  The whole point of being transhuman is that I DON'T</i><br>
<i>&gt;WANNA DIE!</i><br>


<p>
Lucky for us that we can still use life insurance to finance cryonic 
suspension.  I would think that option will not be available once 
people (or even just smaller mammals) start being successfully 
<a name="2121qlink2">revived.  They're not going to want to pay death benefits if you 
didn't actually die.  I'm curious as to whether they'd have a case 
for demanding their money back when I'm revived!</a>

<p>
<a href="1924.html#1934qlink6">&gt;I'd almost rather spend the money on staying healthy - supplements, etc.</a><br>


<p>
The best strategy is to stay alive and healthy as long as possible 
so that the very best suspension techniques are available when 
you deanimate.

<p>
<a href="1924.html#1934qlink7">&gt;Any thoughts?  Suggestions?</a><br>
