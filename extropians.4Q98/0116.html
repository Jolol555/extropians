<a href="0114.html#0116qlink1">&gt;I am beginning to think Erik Moeller was right. Transhumanism is</a><br>
<i>&gt;a noble movement with many bright minds. But the Extropy Institute</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a biased cultish institution that squashes anyone who disagrees</i><br>
<i>&gt;publically with its leader, Max More.</i><br>

Hmmmmm if your being censored it's funny that this post got
through... by the way the error you received wasn't from the
Extropy server:


<p>
<a href="0114.html#0116qlink2">&gt;&lt;extropians@extropy.com&gt;:Connected to 207.228.101.114 but sender</a><br>
<i>&gt;was rejected.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Remote host said: 550 &lt;extrogod@hotmail.com&gt;... You are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;welcome here.</i><br>

<p>
Don't know who extrogod is but it was from hotmail.com, not
extropy.com.

<p>
Did you try sending as extrogod?

<p>
I have been a member of the Institute for a couple of years now and
am unaware of anyone being blocked. Max's standard policy is to
ignore posts of this nature.

<p>
I would guess there was a simple error in sending.

<p>
It's Friday, try decaf. ;)
