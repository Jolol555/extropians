<a name="1308qlink1">Actually, if extrpopians/transhumanists were really interested
in developing a group profile, they should consider going
beyond a very simple inventory like the MBTI (generally
ill-favored in the psychological literature).</a>  There are a
nummber of on-line instruments that could measure things
like:

<p>
locaus of control/attributional style <a href="http://www.queendom.com/lc_frm.html">http://www.queendom.com/lc_frm.html</a> ,
or

<p>
emotional quotient <a href="http://www.queendom.com/emotionaliq_frm.html">http://www.queendom.com/emotionaliq_frm.html</a> , or

<p>
communication skills <a href="http://www.queendom.com/commun_frm.html">http://www.queendom.com/commun_frm.html</a>

<p>
and a variety of personality assessments.  These on-line
instruments also have shaky validity, of course.

<p>
There are a number of other sites with psychological tests
if someone would like to make other suggestions.  We have
the option of testing a hypothesis or we could do an
exploratory study (I think someone called it *trawling the data*).
Individuals could take an assessment battery and confidentially
report their scores to who ever was willing to create a database.
It could help us identify those most susceptible to transhumanistic
memes.
