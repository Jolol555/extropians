Yes, and another important aspect of these stem cells is that 
they are immortal. They're telomeres don't shorten with division.
They wouldn't have to bother with isolating them again once 
they had a good sample. Question though,<a name="0907qlink1"> where would they find
stem cells on Scott Badger's body, since the article refered to a 
very narrow window of time during which these cells may be 
</a>
isolated from embryonic tissue.

I also saw a Geron representative given a lengthy interview on 
the McNeil-Lehrer Report and I couldn't believe how many times 
they were throwing the word immortal around.  I've been tuned 
into all this long enough that it doesn't phase me much, but I 
wonder what it's like for the mass of people who are just starting 
to understand the potential of bio-tech.  I mentioned to Robert 
Ettinger that I suspected that as the prospect of immortality (pun)
became increasingly prominent in our culture, we would see a 
significant increase in those signing up for cryonics, at least those 
who realized that they were JUST going to miss the bus if they 
didn't do something about it.  He replied, 

<p>
"Yes,<a name="0907qlink2"> it's a whole different story if you realize that you may not be 
just another generation in an eternal parade of generations, but 
instead the last dinosaur."</a>

<p>
Another quote from Robert Ettinger is applicable here:

<p>
"The immortalist revolution is so profound, the wonder is not 
that it is taking a long time, but that it is moving at all and no 
one has been lynched."
