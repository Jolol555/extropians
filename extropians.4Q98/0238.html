<a name="0243qlink1">  IAN: Curious. I was just wondering what remotely 
  induced thought/actions would appear like to the 
  actor, and it occurred to me that they may always 
  seem to be self-originated, since the brain would
  assume anything coming from inside it (including 
  an impulse from a implant inside it) is itself; it 
  would evoke no anti-bodies, so to say, in responce 
  to the alien invasion. An implant would slip into 
  the thing known as "myself," and thus the mind
  could not perceive it as being other than self.</a>

<p>
  The man's experience also indicates that subtle
  thoughts can be induced that serve to justify 
  the actions the stimulus effects. The head is
  not just turned, but is so for a reason expressed
   as a set of thoughts and/or feelings.

<p>
<a name="0240qlink1">  It's all very fascinating from a philosophical 
  point of view, with respect to the concepts of
  self, free will, what and who is "the actor."

<p>
  If remote brain control is someone controlling
  another thing, what controls the brain locally?
  I'd say the brain is a set of systems that have
  learned to control each other. Slip a new system
  in, and each subsystem assumes this new system is
  one of the team, and thus "I wanted to turn my head."</a>
