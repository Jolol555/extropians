<i>&gt; Just two problems that pure libertarian capitalism has problems with.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree that Libertarian Capitalism works in 90% of all cases and</i><br>
that it
<br>
<a href="2307.html#2348qlink16">&gt; should eb left to do so as much as is physically possible.  But no</a><br>
system
<br>
<a href="2307.html#2348qlink17">&gt; works 100% of the time.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Samael</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Libertarian/Free Market capitalism promises no cures to anything. 
What it does promote is lack of government coercion.  Any service that
government provides (such as what you list above), no matter how well
intended, must be funded.  Governments realize that people don't just
give them money, so governments fall back on coerced theft.  That's
right.  Taxation is equivalent to violence.  If you don't pay,
eventually you will be met with force.

<p>
Libertarians believe (and humanists and transhumanists and extropians
as well) that social/political goals should not be achieved by use of
violence or force.  Taxation is a form of violence or force and
therefore is inconsistent with libertarian, etc. views.

<p>
If you would like to defend taxation as a nonviolent act, I am
interested in your arguements.
