Dan Fabulich:

<p>
<a href="0376.html#0416qlink1">&gt;I'm well aware that the future hasn't happened yet.  However, if</a><br>
<i>&gt;backwards time travel is in the future, then by definition you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;use it to reach the future's past.  Go far enough back and that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;the present.  Even further back and you've got the past.</i><br>

<p>
elementary

<p>
<a href="0376.html#0416qlink2">&gt;Anyway, if you happen to be a determinist (as I am), then this</a><br>
<i>&gt;argument isn't even relevant.  The future hasn't happened yet, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;it will, and if it's got time travel, then it will very likely</i><br>
<i>&gt;alter its past.</i><br>

<p>
This isn't what you were arguing before:

<p>
From: Dan Fabulich &lt;daniel.fabulich@yale.edu&gt;

<p>
<a href="0332.html#0416qlink3">&gt;Into the future?  Absolutely.  Backwards?  Almost certainly not.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0332.html#0416qlink4">&gt;Consider: if we were develop backwards time travel at some point</a><br>
<i>&gt;in the future, then someone could have gone back in time to some</i><br>
<i>&gt;point before today.  If time travel will be discovered, then it</i><br>
<pre>
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
<br>
<i>&gt;has already happened.</i><br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

</pre>
<p>
<a name="0422qlink1">You are arguing that because no one has come back from the future
that it proves time travel (backward) is impossible. I merely
stated the obvious, the reason no one has come back from the future
isn't that time travel (backward) is impossible (although I believe
it is.) it's that the future hasn't happened yet.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;Thus, due to the very nature of time travel, if it hasn't happened</i><br>
<a href="0332.html#0416qlink5">&gt;already, we can safely assume that it never will.</a><br>

<p>
Here you restate it, the logical error is so obvious, but the words
so slippery, that I was reminded of Lewis Carrol  (mathematician
Charles Dodgson).
