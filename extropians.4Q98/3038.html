    &gt;most of the worst offenders [long boring redundant quotations] seem to be<br>
     &gt;using Microsoft software

<p>
That's no excuse, I use Microsoft software and I don't include a full page of quoted
material for every line of original comment. I hate to scroll through garbage and have started
to get into the habit of just deleting a message if I see nothing but quotations  of quotations
of quotations in the first page. I wish people had to type in all quotations manually, then they'd
have to really think about what they were including and if it was necessary. I've thought about
mentioning the worst offenders by name but everybody knows who they are, and sadly not all
are recent members.
