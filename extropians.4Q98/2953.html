<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Shelter, animals, land, oil, water, trees.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All opf these, while requiring some work (at least to move them to</i><br>
where
<br>
<a href="2913.html#2953qlink3">&gt; they are needed if nothing else) but return a profit vastly out of</a><br>
line with
<br>

like a

<a href="2913.html#2953qlink5">&gt; reasonable way to get rights to it.  Rewarding hard work is fair</a><br>
enough (or

<p>
I think your whole problem with your perception of value is that you
believe value should be static.  Value is not static.  It is
determined dynamically by the demand of those who want the resource
(whether natural or produce by humans).   By what standard are you
measuring the "vastly out of line" profits that those who make natural
resources available to others?  Guess what?  Blind luck is part of
life.  There is no force involved, unless you try to forcibly take
what someone has gained through initiative or through blind luck.  The
government has no business dictating who is lucky and who deserves
what.  Every single basic resource that you named requries work from
those who are willing to trade their time and effort making the
resources ready for human use in exchange for other commodities or to
store the market driven and negotiated (thus fair) value in the form
of money.  I believe that you miss the basic premises of the free
market.
