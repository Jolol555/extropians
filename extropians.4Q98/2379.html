LIFE 2.0 International Competition

<p>
<a name="2387qlink1">This is a call for submission of art works to an international
competition on "art and artificial life." We are looking for works in
electronic and digital media that cross over with the field of a-life
research. Artists whose work uses digital synthesis techniques and
whose conceptual concerns are related to synthetic life and artificial
evolution, are invited to submit their pieces. The work may employ
techniques such as digital genetics, autonomous robotics, recursive
chaotic algorithms, knowbots, computer viruses, avatars or virtual
ecosystems.</a>

<p>
An international jury (Jose Luis Brea, Manuel DeLanda, Joe Faith,
Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Sally Jane Norman and chair Nell Tenhaaf) will
grant three cash awards, with a first prize of US $5,000 (2nd
Prize:$3,500 - 3rd Prize:$1,500), plus seven honorary mentions to the
most innovative electronic art projects related to a-life.
Furthermore, works that are awarded a monetary prize or selected for
an honorary mention will be included in a "Best of LIFE 2.0" video
which will be aired on specialty television programs and circulated at
festivals worldwide. Assessment will be based on video documentation
submitted along with an application form.  The deadline for submission
is Friday, January 15, 1999.

<p>
The Life 2.0 International Competition is sponsored by the Fundacion Arte
y Tecnologia in Madrid, Spain.
