<p>
Most left-handed people have a mixture of left and right hemisphere
control of speech, although the left side is dominant in most cases -
truly right-sided language is rare. The corups calossum is on average ~11%
thicker in left-handers, which may perhaps facilitate cross-hemisphere
communication and bilateral functioning.

<p>
<a href="1467.html#1481qlink2">&gt; Since men are more likely to be left-handed than women, doesn't that imply</a><br>
<i>&gt; that women are less lateralised than men?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1484qlink1">Men have on average a thicker corpus calossum than women, but since
female brains are smaller than male brains the relative size of the CC
in relation to the language areas is larger in women.</a> There is also a
result I saw on a seminar showing that the parts of the CC correlate
more with various intelligence measures in females than in males -
possibly both hemispheres are more involved in processing the same
task in females.

<p>
There is also Geschwind &amp; Galaburda hypothesis that testosterone
influences (from prenatal environment, and genetic biases or
production and sensitivity) the lateralization; it delays the growth
of the posterior left hemisphere, increasing the risk for dyslexia,
stuttering, hyperactivity abd learning disorders as well as anomalous
dominance leading to left-handedness, right-hemisphere language and
increased mathematical and artistic ability. The hypothesis is
unfortunately a bit hard to test, and the difference in handedness and
other properties between men and women is much smaller than predicted.

(taken from Biological Psychology by James W. Kalat - a nice
introduction highly recommended for all extropians with
neuropsychological interest)
