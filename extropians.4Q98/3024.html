I think many of them thought they were playing the game correctly.
Certainly the capital markets thought so.

I'm glad you enjoy my writing.  I'm not involved in burying you in
paperwork, however.  Not my department.

than
<br>
<a href="3012.html#3024qlink19">&gt;they choose me. And before you think I'm some kind of highly educated</a><br>
<i>&gt;professional, I never finished my bachelors degree, I just know a lot about</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer applications, publishing, graphic design, database conversion, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;website development, as well as a number of other things.</i><br>

<p>
I'm glad you have a lot of marketable skills.  But not all people are
skilled in these areas, and others who are skilled would prefer to work at a
stable 9 to 5 job than do consulting.  Personally I enjoy technical work but
have no interest in working 12 hour days.  I therefore have more sympathy
for those who don't view boundless expansion etc. as the end-all, be-all of
existence.

<a href="3012.html#3024qlink20">&gt;&gt; Without getting into Samael's understanding of economics, even a</a><br>
beginning
<br>
<a href="3012.html#3024qlink21">&gt;&gt; economist recognizes the important distinction between positive and</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; normative economics.  It's one thing, for example, to state that some</i><br>
market
<br>
<a href="3012.html#3024qlink22">&gt;&gt; outcome is Pareto optimal, but another thing entirely to say we should</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; restructure our political and social systems to achieve said outcome.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Especially when the restructuring would undo 60 years of bureaucrats</i><br>
building
<br>
<a href="3012.html#3024qlink23">&gt;the welfare state up, eh? There's a lot of emotional and ideological</a><br>
investment
<br>
<a href="3012.html#3024qlink24">&gt;in the status quo. Hopefully the loss of face come jan1 of next year will</a><br>
help
<br>
<i>&gt;things along.</i><br>

<p>
Huh?  I have no involvement in the maintenance of the "welfare state" and am
not overly concerned what happens to it.

more
<br>
<a href="3012.html#3024qlink26">&gt;&gt; concerned about what my next (private sector) employer might do to me, or</a><br>

about

<a href="3012.html#3024qlink27">&gt;non-union employees?</a><br>

<p>
I don't understand the question.  Sombunall government employees are
unionized.  The union has definitely made things cushy for those who are.
Too cushy, in my opinion.  As for other industries, unions have their place.
At times they're a benefit, at others a hinderance.
