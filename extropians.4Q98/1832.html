<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    At low 1 gm/day doses of niacin the immediate release form is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  dramatically more effective, as well as being safer than sustained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  release niacin. IMHO, sustained release niacin should be withdrawn from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  the OTC market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But at 1.5 or 2 grams per day (when both began to have a major effect)</i><br>
<i>&gt; even this study shows it's a toss-up. In addition, more recent studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I have posted several times on other threads, show that at</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical doses, time-release and other non-flush niacin are almost as</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefical for cholesterol, not more liver toxic, and induce more patient</i><br>
<i>&gt; compliance than regular niacin.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, the lastest investigations suggest the possibility that</i><br>
<i>&gt; cholesterol changes may only happen *because* of induced liver toxicity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In that case, no form of niacin should be used as a cholesterol</i><br>
<i>&gt; reduction therapy. Since there are other effective dietary (non-drug)</i><br>
<i>&gt; interventions, that is my current recommendation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
In the book, The Encyclopedia of Nutritional Supplements (1996, Prima
Publishing) by Michael Murray, N.D. (a book I strongly recommend for its
thoroughness and many references), here's some of what he says for niacin.

<p>
Beneficial Effects
<p>
    Niacin supplementation exerts a favorable effect on several health
conditions, especially high cholesterol levels.

<p>
Available Forms
<p>
    Vitamin B3 is available in nutritional supplements as either niacin
(nicotinic acid or nicotinate) or niacinamide (nicotinamide).  Each form has
different applications.  In its nicotinic form, vitamin B3 is an effective
reducer of blood cholesterol levels.  While in its niacinamide form, it is
useful in arthritis and early-onset type I diabetes.
<p>
    Doses in excess of 50 mg of niacin, but not niacinamide, typically produce
a transient flushing of the skin.  To get around the problem of skin flushing,
drug and supplement manufacturers have developed "timed-released" products.
However, while these preparations may effectively eliminate the problem of
skin flushing, they are associated with greater liver destruction and serious
side effects (discussed below under Safety Issues).  A better way to eliminate
the problem of skin flushing is to use inositol hexaniacinate (also known as
inositol hexanicotinate and, for short, hexaniacin).  This form of niacin has
been used in Europe for over 30 years with an excellent safey record.

<p>
Principal Uses
<p>
    The principal uses of niacin and inositol hexaniacinate are in the
treatment of elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, Raynaud's
phenomenon, and intermittant claudication.  Niacinamide is used in
recent-onset type I diabetes mellitus and arthritis.

<p>
Comparative Studies
<p>
    The lipid-lowering activity of niacin was first described in the 1950s.
We now know niacin does much more than lower total cholesterol.  Specifically,
niacin lowers LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) lipoprotein, triglyceride, and fibrinogen
levels, while simultaneously raising HDL cholesterol levels (ref 1).
<p>
    The famed Coronary Drug Project demonstrated that niacin was the only
lipid-lowering agent to actually reduce overall mortalilty (ref 2).  Its
effects are long-lasting as demonstrated in a 15 year follow-up study to the
Coronary Drug Project.

<p>
Inositol Hexaniacinate
<p>
    Inositol hexaniacinate is a special form of niacin composed of six
nicotinic acid molecules bound to and surrounding one molecule of inositol, an
unofficial member of the B vitamin group.  Inositol hexaniacinate exerts the
benefits of niacin without flushing or other side effects.  It has been used
in Europe for over 30 years not only to lower cholesterol, but also to improve
blood flow in the treatment of claudication.  Although inositol hexaniacinate
yelds slightly better results than standard niacin, the big advantage is that
it is safer and much better tolerated (ref 12 &amp; 13).

<p>
Dosage Ranges
<p>
    You should not use sustained-release niacin.  If you use pure crystalline
niacin, start with a dose of 100 mg three times a day and carefully increase
the dosage over a period of 4 to 6 weeks to the full therapeutic dose of 1.5
grams to 3 grams daily in divided dosage.  If you are using inositol
hexaniacinate, begin with 500 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks and then increase
to 1000 mg.  It is best to take either crystalline niacin or inositol
hexaniacinate with meals.

<p>
Safety Issues
<p>
    The side effects of niacin are well known.  The most common and bothersome
side effect is the skin flushing that typically occurs 20 to 30 minutes after
taking the niacin.  Other occasional side effects of niacin include gastric
irritation, nausea, and liver damage.  In an attempt to combat the acute
reaction of skin flushing, several manufacturers began marketing
"sustained-release","timed-released", or "slow-released" niacin products.
Although these forms of niacin reduce skin flushing, they are actually more
toxic to the liver.  A recent study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA) strongly recommended that sustained-released niacin
be restricted from use because of the high percentage (78 percent) of patient
withdrawal because of side effects; 52 percent of the patients taking the
sustained-release niacin developed liver damage, while none of the patients
taking immediate-release niacin developed liver damage (ref 42).
<p>
    Again, inositol hexaniacinate is the safest form of niacin currently
available.  Both short- and long-term studies show it is virtually free of
side effects other than an occasional person experiencing mild gastric upset
or mild skin irritation.
<p>
    Because niacin can impair glucose tolerance, it should probably not be
used in diabetics unless they are under close observation.  Niacin should not
be used in patients with pre-existing liver disease or elevation in liver
enzymes, gout, or peptic ulcers.
<p>
    Regardless of the form on niacin being used, periodic checking (minimum
every 3 months ) of cholesterol and liver function tests are indicated when
high-dose (i.e., 2 to 6 grams per day) niacin, inositol hexaniacinate, or
niacinamide therapy is being used.
