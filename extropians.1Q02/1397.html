</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's the difference? If you break the above down to its components,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian philosophy = CMT + libertarianism + humanism
</em><br>
<p>No you don't.  Why do you keep adding libertarianism?  The early Extropy
<br>
Institute and Extropian List contained liberals, conservatives, socialists,
<br>
anarchists and other political bents besides libertarianism.  It is
<br>
inaccurate to say that it was only libertarian or that its purpose was more
<br>
libertarian than transhumanistic.
<br>
<p>Why do you keep excluding transhumanism?  Extropy Institute was established
<br>
to be a transhumanist organization.  This very list was founded as the first
<br>
transhumanist list.  The Extropian Principles were written to establish a
<br>
specific definition of transhumanism.  You can't pretend that extropy has no
<br>
connection to transhumanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, what I mean with my little formulas is that when humanists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered how to deal with the coming technological advances and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact on the human condition, the result was transhumanism. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarians did the same, the result was extropy.
</em><br>
<p>This is not an accurate history.  Humanists did indeed create transhumanism.
<br>
However those same transhumanists went on to define extropian philosophy.  I
<br>
don't see how you can separate their history or try to claim they evolved
<br>
independently of each other.
<br>
<p>Where are you getting these ideas?  They don't seem to match history or make
<br>
sense.  You seem to be trying to split the global transhumanist community
<br>
into separate unrelated sectors.  This won't work.  There is too much
<br>
interaction among the transhumanists.  It's a small world, and the group of
<br>
transhumanists are even smaller.  We have worked together, shared ideas,
<br>
critiqued each other's ideas for so long that it is impossible to totally
<br>
separate any of us as being totally isolated from the others.
