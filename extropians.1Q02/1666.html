<p>
coyyote stated:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Purpose is a human idea, it lies only within the questioner, or simply, it
<br>
is what you think it is &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Given the context of this mailing list, let us say that purpose is produced 
<br>
by the questioner, which may or may not be a homo sapien. Purpose will evolve 
<br>
with what life's technological efforts, may successfully produce. I would say 
<br>
that (for example) a person belonging as part of the 17th century Puritans, 
<br>
would not deem to colonize the solar system as a worthy pursuit; not only 
<br>
because of its &quot;sinfulness&quot; but also because such concepts as a Newcomen 
<br>
engine would lay lie a century in their future. 
<br>
<p>I will rip-off Sir Arthur C. Clarke's Songs of Distant Earth, and speculate 
<br>
that the purpose of intelligent life (with humankind being merely a rung) is 
<br>
to restart(reboot?) the universe. &quot;...If you are experiencing your Universe 
<br>
disipate into a cold death, press 2; If you are experiencing your Universe 
<br>
collapse into a Heat Death, Press 3....&quot;
