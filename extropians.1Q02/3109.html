<p>
Greeeeeeeeeeeeeeetings,
<br>
<p>I've seen several posts in this thread which made me wonder:
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Did he/she read GISAI and CFAI several times 'each' ?????&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;If he/she did, was it done with an open mind ? I think not. If I start
<br>
bla-bla-ing about planet disassembly without reading what the people who
<br>
formulated the hypothesis have to say, some pople on this list would get
<br>
pissed off. And rightly so. It works BOTH ways. I fully second Eli: there
<br>
***should have been** some progress **at least - really at least** at the
<br>
conceptual level on CFAI and GISAI. Questions asked here, ***were***
<br>
answered several times on the SL4 list which is archived online. Doing 'Sl4
<br>
archive' at google pulls it. Searching on the 'Low Beyond' pulls it. What I
<br>
cannot understand, is the 'unspoken' undercurrent biased attitude about CFAI
<br>
and GISAI. I'm no fu**ing genius, I'm an everyday average curious kid. If I
<br>
can grok most of what Eli writes, it's because I spend a lot of time trying
<br>
to see what he sees. I **spend a lot of time** trying to **see what Eliezer
<br>
was seeing** when writing/thinking about it. I 'hijack' his models. It's
<br>
only after having done so (having a clear model of Eli's way of thinking
<br>
about this - which is mutating as we speak) that I can
<br>
agree/disagree/update/improve the design/ thinking/model or take a tangent
<br>
if I wish to do so. I re-read CFAI and GISAI every few weeks, I think about
<br>
it most of my awaken hours. Certain questions cannot be answered in one or
<br>
two lines. There's no magic stuff, it's all inter-connected and elements can
<br>
only be understood if their profundly-complex relationships with other
<br>
elements are understood.
<br>
<p>It is not my intention to offend anyone ( I mean it ==)), however, this list
<br>
is where I'd expect a certain level of 'minditronium'. Here more than
<br>
anywhere else is where I would expect a general 'what is he/she seeing when
<br>
saying that' attitude. Is 'expecting' where it went wrong ? *sweet smile*
<br>
Someone complained a few days ago that black holes were basic stuff that was
<br>
explained all over the place. That person wanted 'denser' content, less
<br>
VaporMindWare. I feel the same way. *sweet smile*
<br>
<p>I repeat: I **do not intend** to offend anyone, but Eli wrote GISAI and CFAI
<br>
for people to read/study/hack it. I do not believe it's done as often as it
<br>
should be done. I also do not believe it has anything to do with how it's
<br>
written. For Arona's sakes !!!! This is the Extropians list. People should
<br>
be wanting to understand for the goddam sake of it, because understanding
<br>
correlates with knowledge increase. It should not matter how it is written
<br>
or what it smells or whether it likes coffee with/out milk *rolls eyes*. The
<br>
AI community is known to have NO vocabulary. Why should Eli not create his
<br>
own if he feels that some things need to be formalized instead of being
<br>
shoved under the carpet ? If Eli saw (or believed he did or does) where
<br>
Classical AI went wrong, so can I. If I can, so can everyone. The AI
<br>
community has been attempting AI without understanding the human brain and
<br>
that is stupid. Anyone trying to do that will never get anything done in AI.
<br>
Yet, that is what the AI community did. They all got funky with buzzwords
<br>
and 'Expert systems' and used AI everywhere it had nothing to do with AI.
<br>
Now that it's going down the drain coz of lack of results, anyone who even
<br>
pretends to try creating AI in a different way (hint: Friendly Seed AI ) ,
<br>
is shot down in flames. That's a loser attitude, period.
<br>
<p><p>Arona Ndiaye.
<br>
<p>PS: English ain't even my mother tongue, if I can get it, how hard can it
<br>
'conceptually' be ? Honestly ? *waves to everyone*
<br>
PS2: And **no**, I-am-not-defending Eliezer, just in case someone was
<br>
jumping on that train. I just want people to read CFAI and GISAI, for real.
<br>
PS3: The worst of all that: Eli saw it coming and had a paragraph explaining
<br>
why he believed **his** approach to AI was different and was likely to
<br>
succeed where Classical AI failed..
