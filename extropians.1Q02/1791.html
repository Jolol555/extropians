</em><br>
<p>This is of course true, and that is maybe the worst part: to many,
<br>
Rifkin is the best source of information about what the next big thing
<br>
will be in biosciences. This is a function we better supplant!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i'm sure i would find out sooner or later - but since i am smart enough to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see that artificial wombs are good things (and i would hope everyone else here is, too!), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i'd say at least in the context of this list, the article had a positive effect.
</em><br>
<p>Well, technology in itself is not good or bad, it is uses of it which have to
<br>
be evaluated. I think artificial wombs would be largely beneficial; I had a
<br>
fun discussion with a friend (who has also been a mother) about this, and she
<br>
was even more in favor of external wombs than me. But she told me the
<br>
reactions to the idea when she brought it up at her work was very negative,
<br>
especially from the women - while at the same time they laughed merrily at
<br>
the idea of male pregnancies. Which to me suggests a strategy to loosen up a
<br>
bit of rigid thinking about reproduction.
