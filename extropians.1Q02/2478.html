<p>
I saw another story this morning on the issue of reviewing open source
<br>
software for bugs. Sardonix, www.sardonix.org, is a new project to
<br>
organize the search for bugs, keep track of which code has been audited,
<br>
and give credit to the people who find the most bugs.  The project is
<br>
being funded by DARPA for two years (although they are not giving cash
<br>
prizes to bug finders).
<br>
<p>The story is at <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23956.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23956.html</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventional wisdom has long held that open source software garners
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra security from the sheer number of people who are free to review
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the code -- &quot;Many eyes make all bugs shallow,&quot; the adage goes. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reality is often different; it turns out many of those eyes have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little interest in the thankless task of examining other people's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code for security holes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the &quot;many eyes&quot; school of software security may become more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a theory, thanks to a reward system devised by a Oregon-based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer scientist and funded by the U.S. Defense Department, which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was announced over security mailing lists Tuesday.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part software development system and part psychological gambit, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sardonix project would replace the current loosely-structured open
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source security review process with a central Web site that tracks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which code has been audited for security holes, and by whom. An
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;automated reward loop grants points to volunteer auditors according
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the amount of code they've examined, and the number of security
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holes they've found. Auditors lose points if a subsequent audit by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someone else turns up bugs they missed.
