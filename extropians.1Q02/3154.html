<em>&gt; Well, my first reaction to this was to laugh and say, &quot;I give up!&quot;  Some days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you just can't win...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On reflection, though, I think that there are two dynamics here.  Anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to think precisely will need to use precise terminology.  So if you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad writer and you want to think precisely, you use complete neologisms -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary, hard to remember or identify once you're a few pages out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context.  Good writing practice is to minimize this impact by adapting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing terms where possible, and using recognizable word combinations where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a genuinely new term is needed.  So it's preferable - in terms of being able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think clearly and reason clearly - to use neologisms rather than not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any new words at all, but it's also preferable to use recognizable language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than pure neologisms.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, using familiar words helps, but you don't want to risk re-
<br>
defining an existing term in a way that conflicts with the ordinary
<br>
understanding of its use in a similar context.  To return to my example
<br>
of poker terms, the term &quot;drawing dead&quot; nicely evokes familiar images and
<br>
feelings that help make the term easier to understand, even though no real
<br>
&quot;drawing&quot; is taking place (in a stud game or hold'em game, for example),
<br>
and nothing is actually dying.  But it is far preferable to define and use
<br>
the short evocative term like &quot;drawing dead&quot; than to constantly be saying
<br>
things like &quot;...holding a speculative hand which you hope will improve
<br>
with forthcoming cards, but which might lose even if it does improve&quot;,
<br>
and there is little chance of the term being confusing.
