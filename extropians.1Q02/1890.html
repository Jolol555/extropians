<em>&gt;Is there any evidence to suggest a link between autism and birth / early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parenting methods? I read some while ago that this was the case but have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been unable to find any reference to it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Judith Harris, in a book called The Nurture Assumption, makes a strong
<br>
argument against the general claim that parenting methods affect children's
<br>
behavior outside of the home. She specifically says that &quot;autistic children
<br>
are born that way&quot;, but doesn't refer to any evidence that is specific to
<br>
autism. (Simon Baron-Cohen, the autism researcher quoted at the start of
<br>
this thread, describes The Nurture Assumption as &quot;shockingly persuasive&quot;).
<br>
&nbsp;The book Shadow Syndromes, which has a good chapter on autism, says
<br>
&quot;Autism is not caused by bad parents&quot;, but it also fails to cite any
<br>
specific evidence to support that claim.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It sure looks to me like the increased ability of autistic people to
<br>
reproduce is a significant part of the increase in people diagnosed as
<br>
autistic, although changing criteria for diagnosis probably play a big
<br>
part too.
<br>
&nbsp;I think it's misleading to credit the airplane for enabling people to
<br>
change their culture. The automobile was more important at doing that
<br>
than air travel was.
<br>
&nbsp;I also doubt that a mildly autistic person is more readily accepted
<br>
in places where cultural differences make social oddness more normal.
<br>
I think the main effect is that it has become easier for mildly autistic
<br>
people to find cultures (such as that of Silicon Valley) that attract
<br>
other mildly autistic people, and therefore become cultures that seem
<br>
less foreign.
