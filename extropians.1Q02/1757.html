<p>
I've been working towards building a lab in my basement for a while now.
<br>
Even more difficult in the transient life of a student apartment-renter.
<br>
I've found things that make it a lot cheaper and easier.
<br>
<p>If you live near a large research university, go dumpster diving.  I
<br>
make no claims as to the legality of this, but you can find good stuff
<br>
that labs are just throwing away.  Even better, if you know someone in
<br>
one of the departments, you can have him or her watch out for stuff that
<br>
is getting tossed and let you rifle through it first.  
<br>
<p>I know this list usually has a bias against all things Scientific
<br>
American, but their &quot;Amateur Scientist&quot; CDROM really does have some
<br>
great stuff in it, especially from back before a lot of it was
<br>
less-than-legal.  It contains all 72 years of the &quot;Amateur Scientist&quot;
<br>
section of SciAm.  A lot of the articles describe make-able, serviceable
<br>
stuff, and many others contain ideas which can be bettered for your home
<br>
lab.  
<br>
<p>Beyond that, there are some really great books on making home
<br>
laboratories.  Many of them are older, from when science seemed a little
<br>
more accessible to the average person, but they often have great ideas.
<br>
They're especially useful for the incidental stuff, like glassware and
<br>
small equipment, which can get you mired in trivia if you try to buy it
<br>
all.
