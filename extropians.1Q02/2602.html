<p>HAL!  This is a helllll of an idea.  Good thinking!
<br>
<p>We could set up a system whereby your car has a radio transmitter that
<br>
broadcasts to traffic lights the value of your time.  If you are out poking
<br>
around on a Sunday afternoon, you might set it lower than if you are late to
<br>
work, or if you have several business associates in your car, or if you
<br>
are racing to get to your kid's daycare center at the end of the day where
<br>
they charge a dollar a minute after 1800 (they really do this in Taxifornia).
<br>
<p>Emergency vehicles would automatically get a very high time-value rate.
<br>
<p>The traffic lights then change in such a way to maximize profits, and
<br>
send out signals to a receiver in your car to figure out *your bill for
<br>
that month* which you then hafta pay if you want your receiver to
<br>
keep working.  If it doesnt work, your time automatically becomes
<br>
cheap indeed.
<br>
<p>The proceeds would reduce the taxes that would otherwise be spent
<br>
on maintaining roads.  The perfect user fee!  Each person is free to
<br>
set the value of their time to whatever they feel it is worth.
<br>
<p>Hal, you are the Chosen One, bud.  spike
