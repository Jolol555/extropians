</em><br>
<p>A quick thought.
<br>
<p>Below is a list of the top ten causes of accidental
<br>
death.  Now ask yourself how many of these can be
<br>
eliminated by technological means?  Specifically,
<br>
ubiquitous smart surveillance, ubiquitous smart
<br>
objects, and ubiquitous communication and cooperation
<br>
between/among these, seem to substantially reduce
<br>
(eliminate?) these problems.  Accidental death is
<br>
almost entirely the result of &quot;operator error&quot; ie
<br>
human screwup.  With &quot;AI Bodyguard&quot; (TM) watching over
<br>
you to keep you safe, what other risks remain than
<br>
deliberate human violence and sudden unanticipated
<br>
natural disaster?
<br>
<p>1. Motor vehicle crashes Deaths per year: 43,200 
<br>
2. Falls Deaths per year: 14,900 
<br>
3. Poisoning by solids and liquids D/year: 8,600 
<br>
4. Drowning Deaths per year: 4,000 
<br>
5. Fires and burns Deaths per year: 3,700 
<br>
6. Suffocation Deaths per year: 3,300
<br>
7. Firearms Deaths per year: 1,500 
<br>
8. Poisoning by gases Deaths per year: 700 
<br>
9. Medical &amp; Surgical Complications and Misadventures 
<br>
Deaths per year: 500 
<br>
10. Machinery Deaths per year: 350 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
