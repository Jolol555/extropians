<p>Chuck Kuecker responded:

<em>&gt; Obviously, you have never seen a Cary, Illinois water bill - or the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; without rain in the summer...
</em><br>
<p>That sounds like what we have in California, that Spike was referring to. 
<br>
Prices low enough that people don't worry about water except during an
<br>
emergency.  When supplies get tight, they don't raise prices, they pass short
<br>
term laws prohibiting you from washing your car, filling your pool, and in
<br>
extreme situations from watering your lawn.  (for the record, we don't have a
<br>
pool, and we let the lawn die planning to cnovert to strawberries  It's just
<br>
weeds now.)  The social pressure gets pretty extreme, too, with everyone
<br>
watching what everyone else is doing.  
<br>
<p>If they'd just raise the prices, we'd use less when the use didn't make sense,
<br>
and people would find substitutes or alternative sources.  If prices went high
<br>
as often as we have below-normal rainfall, someone might think it was
<br>
worthwhile piping grey water around (recycled, cleaned, not clean enough to be
<br>
potable) for people to use in toilets and watering.  Instead we get
<br>
prohibition and reinforcement of the socialist way every few years.  
<br>
<p>Same as we did during the energy crisis, since it was illegal to raise power
<br>
prices for consumers.  The social pressure and the race to &quot;cooperate&quot; during
<br>
the emergency was scary to behold.

C. J. Cherryh, &quot;Invader&quot;, on why we visit very old buildings:
      &quot;A sense of age, of profound truths.  Respect for something hands
      made, that's stood through storms and wars and time.  It 
      persuades us that things we do may last and matter.&quot;
