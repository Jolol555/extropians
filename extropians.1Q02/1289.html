<em>&gt;&gt; ?  I am not altogether sure I can trust Julian Simon for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; statistics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please, use any source of statistics you desire, or show any attacks on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Simon's work that provide better statistics, rather than attacking his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivation.  Do you have any sources that disagree that the gap keeps getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smaller?  I  think Simon's opponents are driven by envy, and think Simon's
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I haven't been able to find any statistics from Simon that say the gap
<br>
between the rich and poor is getting smaller. The closest I can find is
<br>
a claim that &quot;Richer countries have less inequality than poorer countries&quot;,
<br>
which could just reflect phenomena like Ferdinand Marcos making himself
<br>
unreasonably rich and impoverishing the Philipines in the process. I.e.
<br>
countries that are malfunctioning in creating wealth may also malfunction
<br>
in other respects, without that implying much about the trend in growing
<br>
countries, or about what happens in countries that choose to remain in
<br>
primitive conditions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;One source of such statistics which I'm fairly sure you have read is
<br>
Luxury Fever. From page 33: &quot;in 1979 the 95th-percentile U.S. earner
<br>
received 10 times as much as the 5th-percentile earner, the corresponding
<br>
ratio for 1993 was more than 25. ... CEO's of America's largest companies,
<br>
for instance, earned 35 times as much as the average worker in 1973; today
<br>
they earn some 200 times as much&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;Luxury Fever is at least as selective in what statistics it presents as
<br>
Simon is, and I'm not sure what the best measures of income inequality
<br>
would say (Luxury Fever doesn't seem to say much about whether people
<br>
in poor nations are catching up to those in rich nations).
<br>
&nbsp;Luxury Fever does a good job of explaining why we should expect people to
<br>
have evolved a value system which cares at least as much about inequality
<br>
as about absolute wealth. Pointing out bad effects of envy doesn't seem
<br>
to invalidate the belief that equality is good for people.
<br>
&nbsp;Luxury Fever also provides clear theories of why inequality has been
<br>
increasing - the rise of winner-take-all markets, and the erosion of
<br>
norms that stopped people from paying market prices for top executives,
<br>
sports players, etc. Does Simon have a clear theory of why inequality
<br>
should be decreasing?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;While searching for Simon's statistics, I noticed that one of the things
<br>
that Ehrlich was still willing to bet on around 1994 was:
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;The gap in wealth between the richest 10% of humanity and the
<br>
poorest 10% will be greater in 2004 than in 1994&quot;
<br>
(taken from <a href="http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/People/julian_simon.html">http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/People/julian_simon.html</a>)
<br>
That was part of a bet that Simon didn't accept, but Ehrlich's insistence
<br>
on bundling it with claims that were even less relevant to Simon's arguments
<br>
(e.g. declining sperm counts) obscures most of the implications of Simon's
<br>
unwillingness to take the bet.
