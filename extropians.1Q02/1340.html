<br>
<p>The first super-intelligent beings may not be based on humans at all, but on 
<br>
apes. Since moral and legal considerations will limit experimentation with 
<br>
human brain &gt;uploading&lt;/A&gt;, scientists may first turn to apes, and they may 
<br>
quickly enhance themselves. Could they become our overlords, à la &gt;Planet&lt;/A&gt; of 
<br>
the Apes?
<br>
<p><p>Many have debated just how the first superior or &quot;post-human&quot; intelligences 
<br>
might come to be. While some don't think we'll ever spawn something smarter 
<br>
than humans, many people in the &gt;AI&lt;/A&gt;, &gt;uploading&lt;/A&gt;, &gt;nanotechnology&lt;/A&gt; and related 
<br>
communities think it's only a question of how and when.
<br>
<p>The big debate is whether we will do this by creating an &quot;uploaded&quot; human 
<br>
being, or a true &gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/A&gt;. An uploaded human being comes about 
<br>
by scanning the brain of an existing person in some fashion, and using that &gt;
<br>
information&lt;/A&gt; to create an &gt;artificial brain&lt;/A&gt; with the same neural pathways and 
<br>
other connections and systems that make a brain what it is. This uploaded 
<br>
person could be a copy of a living person or a re-animation of a deceased 
<br>
one, or the process could be done gradually, replacing a &gt;biological&lt;/A&gt; brain &gt;
<br>
neuron&lt;/A&gt; by &gt;neuron&lt;/A&gt;, turning a living cell-based brain into one based on 
<br>
something else right in the skull.
<br>
<p>The uploaded person would think and act just like a traditional human, if 
<br>
given a similar environment and body (&gt;biological&lt;/A&gt; or otherwise) to be part of. 
<br>
However, the temptation to enhance this new brain would be tremendous, and 
<br>
many predict such people would quickly become super-human. They would start 
<br>
by &gt;thinking&lt;/A&gt; faster, and expanding and perfecting their &gt;memory&lt;/A&gt; and other 
<br>
mental abilities. Then they might connect themselves with outside data 
<br>
networks and databases, giving them the ability to learn &gt;knowledge&lt;/A&gt; just by 
<br>
copying it, or gather more of it faster than any natural human. And of course 
<br>
they (we?) will enhance their brains in ways that present-day thinkers have 
<br>
not yet conceived.
<br>
<p>Others expect the success will first come to the effort to create an &gt;
<br>
artificial intelligence&lt;/A&gt; with hand-written or evolved &gt;software&lt;/A&gt;, running on 
<br>
computers like the ones we have today, or their successors. Such beings would 
<br>
be more alien to us than uploaded people, though they would be our children 
<br>
in a fairly real sense, designed at first by us, instilled with our values, 
<br>
and quite possibly raised by us as children are. However, clearly they will 
<br>
begin superior to us in many aspects (perfect memories, superb mathematical 
<br>
and rote skills and much more) and initially inferior to us in others. Soon 
<br>
they would surpass our abilities in almost all areas.
<br>
<p>Modern humans can't really conceive of how these &quot;post humans&quot; would think or 
<br>
act, any more than apes can write stories about human &gt;philosophy&lt;/A&gt;. Indeed, 
<br>
noted author &gt;Vernor Vinge&lt;/A&gt; calls this point of transition to post-human &gt;
<br>
intelligence&lt;/A&gt; a &quot;&gt;singularity&lt;/A&gt;,&quot; a metaphorical reference to the mathematical 
<br>
discontinuities beyond which prediction is impossible.
<br>
<p>I happen to slightly favor the &gt;uploading&lt;/A&gt; camp. To upload a mind it is 
<br>
necessary only to understand the lower level workings of the brain enough to 
<br>
recreate them in another medium. One need not understand much about the 
<br>
higher level activities which bring about conscious and intelligent &gt;thought&lt;/A&gt;. 
<br>
Just as a &gt;hardware&lt;/A&gt; engineer can build a &gt;computer&lt;/A&gt; which can play chess knowing 
<br>
only about how transistors and logic gates work. The chess &gt;software&lt;/A&gt; she 
<br>
simply copies. To build a real &gt;AI&lt;/A&gt; requires that we actually either understand 
<br>
how &gt;intelligence&lt;/A&gt; works--which we are not close to doing, or perhaps that we 
<br>
understand its mid-level functions and create something we can turn 
<br>
intelligent by raising it over the course of many years, just as we do with 
<br>
our own babies.
<br>
<p>However, the &gt;uploading&lt;/A&gt; scenario presents a rather disturbing conclusion. The 
<br>
first super-beings may not be based on humans at all, but instead may be 
<br>
apes.
<br>
<p>In the course of modern &gt;science&lt;/A&gt;, it is always the case that we &gt;experiment&lt;/A&gt; 
<br>
with animals first, years before we attempt anything on people. It's the 
<br>
ethical way, and in many cases the only legal way. As such, as we develop the 
<br>
<em>&gt;technology&lt;/A&gt; to scan or convert an existing brain into an artificial form, 
</em><br>
we'll try this first on animals. We'll start with lower ones, and then work 
<br>
up to our closest relatives, the chimpanzee and bonobo.
<br>
<p>Some suppose the &gt;uploading&lt;/A&gt; process might begin by scanning a recently 
<br>
deceased human brain, which can be done with minimal legal complication. 
<br>
Others feel it might be better to work with a living brain, or a healthy 
<br>
brain that was killed deliberately for the purpose of scanning--what might be 
<br>
called a &quot;destructive scan&quot; if expressed in cold technical &gt;language&lt;/A&gt;. We'll do 
<br>
this with apes several years before we do it with humans. Of this I am fairly 
<br>
certain.
<br>
<p>Indeed a great moment of success will come when somebody first creates an &gt;
<br>
artificial brain&lt;/A&gt; that is a copy of a real chimp's brain, and which is shown 
<br>
to all outside signs to act, think and remember like the original living 
<br>
chimp. It is unlikely that scientific &gt;ethics&lt;/A&gt; or law would allow things to be 
<br>
done with humans until the process has been reliably demonstrated multiple 
<br>
times on apes. That even applies to dead humans, since many, including 
<br>
myself, would argue that the human with a non-&gt;biological&lt;/A&gt; brain is still a 
<br>
human being and worthy of certain rights.
<br>
<p>Once this chimp brain is created, it will cause a flurry of &gt;research&lt;/A&gt;. Quite 
<br>
possibly, the &quot;&gt;software&lt;/A&gt;&quot; part of the brain will be published and made 
<br>
available for others to work on, and the &gt;hardware&lt;/A&gt; will be readily available 
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>Indeed, the &gt;software&lt;/A&gt; of this chimp brain might be made available for free 
<br>
distribution. An &quot;&gt;open source&lt;/A&gt;&quot; ape, for all to &gt;experiment&lt;/A&gt; on.
<br>
<p>And they will &gt;experiment&lt;/A&gt; on it. Once again, even if a human brain is 
<br>
similarly available, moral and legal considerations will limit what 
<br>
experimentation can be done, while actions on the ape-brain will probably not 
<br>
be nearly as limited.
<br>
<p>Apes however are <A HREF="http://www.cnpt.embrapa.br/redbiobr/nov_1020.htm">remarkably similar to humans</A>. As you may know, chimps share 
<br>
98% of our &gt;DNA&lt;/A&gt;. In addition, we have made intensive study of the ways in 
<br>
which they are different, and we will attempt to learn more.
<br>
<p>Thus some of the first experiments on this artificial chimp brain will be to 
<br>
enhance it along the lines that humans and chimps are different. Humans are 
<br>
not so qualitatively different in our brains from chimps, though the few 
<br>
differences have a magnified effect in our capabilities. We have more of 
<br>
certain types of brain structures, and some of our structures are larger and 
<br>
have more neural connections. There is no component of a human brain not 
<br>
found in a chimp brain. Experimenters will quickly try to see what happens if 
<br>
you modify those aspects of the working chimp brain. They will also &quot;graft&quot; &gt;
<br>
information&lt;/A&gt; from post-mortem and live scans of human brains, where available.
<br>
<p>If the artificial chimp brains &quot;run&quot; much faster than &gt;biological&lt;/A&gt; ones, they 
<br>
will be able to perform these experiments quickly. They may be able to have 
<br>
their &gt;computer&lt;/A&gt; play out a thousand different experimental scenaria, each 
<br>
playing out years of &gt;biological&lt;/A&gt; scale time--perhaps in just a day of real 
<br>
time. They will quickly learn what works and what doesn't, what enhances and 
<br>
what doesn't. And there will be many of them.
<br>
<p>I think quite quickly they could create a chimp brain capable of human level &gt;
<br>
intelligence&lt;/A&gt; or beyond. It may then need training or &quot;rearing&quot; by real human 
<br>
parents, but it will be a very quick and supremely capable learner. All this 
<br>
will happen much more quickly than the ethical changes to occur which would 
<br>
allow scientists to do similar experiments on human based brains.
<br>
<p>The chimp brain might also marry the chimp with the best that grounds-up &gt;
<br>
artificial intelligence&lt;/A&gt; has to offer at the time. The post-human may be the 
<br>
result of the combination of the two. Vinge, in his 1966 story, &quot;Bookworm, 
<br>
Run&quot; (now back in print in his latest collection) imagined a &gt;computer&lt;/A&gt;-linked 
<br>
live chimp that tried to escape its creators using its near to human (and in 
<br>
some ways superior) level &gt;intelligence&lt;/A&gt;.
<br>
<p>Of course, once these enhanced chimp brains--or perhaps best to describe them 
<br>
as hybrids of chimpanzee base, human improvements and &gt;AI&lt;/A&gt; &gt;software&lt;/A&gt;--do become 
<br>
as smart as or smarter than us, they will of course continue the &gt;research&lt;/A&gt; on 
<br>
how to enhance themselves. At this point they may decide their own ethical 
<br>
rules about how this takes place. But smart as they are, and with human 
<br>
friends as they will have, they will quickly become powerful in the human 
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>Charleton Heston as Taylor in Planet of the Apes zoomed into the &gt;future&lt;/A&gt; to &quot;a 
<br>
<em>&gt;planet&lt;/A&gt; where apes evolved from men.&quot; Perhaps this wasn't entirely ridiculous.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming they can think both better and faster than we can, it won't be long, 
<br>
in fact, before they are running the &quot;&gt;planet&lt;/A&gt; of the apes.&quot; Is this a &gt;
<br>
dystopian&lt;/A&gt; nightmare or a potential paradise? That, we can't predict. They may 
<br>
feel quite a debt to their creators--humans tend to think that way--or they 
<br>
might hate us. They might well also arrange for humans to go through the same 
<br>
process that improved them, now that it is fully developed, and as such 
<br>
humans themselves would reach post-human &gt;intelligence&lt;/A&gt;.
<br>
<p>But the chimps would have gotten their first, and the humans would not 
<br>
necessarily be any smarter than they are. Just more experienced at living in 
<br>
real time, and more used to the enhanced parts of their minds. Minsky 
<br>
wondered if ordinary humans would be lucky enough to be kept as pets by these 
<br>
superior intelligences; one wonders if he imagined that &quot;they&quot; might be our 
<br>
former pets to begin with?
<br>
<p>In part, we should hope that the uploaded apes are bonobos rather than 
<br>
chimpanzees. Bonobos and chimps split from a common ancestor that itself 
<br>
split from the human line about 7 million years ago. Bonobos evolved in a 
<br>
land of plenty, and thus are peaceful, caring, hedonistic and fairly 
<br>
egalitarian in their social structures. Chimps are strongly hierarchical and 
<br>
violent in theirs, due to the harsher environment they evolved in. So let's 
<br>
encourage the researchers that do &gt;experiment&lt;/A&gt; with copies of ape minds to tend 
<br>
toward the bonobo. You may be choosing the &gt;future&lt;/A&gt; masters of the world.
