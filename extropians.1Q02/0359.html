<em>&gt;Unfortunately, it appears that this very influential intellectual has

<em>&gt;Notice three things: 1) he has adopted the terminology of &quot;posthumanity&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describe what he warns against; 2) although he makes a gesture of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condemnation against Rifkin and other &quot;luddites&quot;, his position is not really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinct from theirs and 3) his unfortunate prescription is government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regulation of an admittedly unprecedented type and scale.  Too bad.
</em><br>
<p>I find his article very revealing.  It gives us a clear picture of what 
<br>
some who are neither Luddites nor futurists think about a posthuman 
<br>
world.  However, I find his depth of knowledge lacking and down right 
<br>
limited, he does come out and use the term &quot;posthuman&quot; which I think is a 
<br>
step up.  Now, how do we deal with this?  By sending out a Press Release 
<br>
from ExI addressing, perhaps, several issues that he brings up.  Herein, we 
<br>
will show where he is correct and where he is incorrect by relating to pros 
<br>
and cons.
<br>
<p>Here is a quote:  &quot;But the posthuman world could be one that is far more 
<br>
hierarchical and competitive than the one that currently exists, and full 
<br>
of social conflict as a result. It could be one in which any notion of 
<br>
shared humanity is lost, because we have mixed human genes with those of so 
<br>
many other species that we no longer have a clear idea of what a human 
<br>
being is. It could be one in which the average person is living well into 
<br>
his or her second century, sitting in a nursing home hoping for an 
<br>
unattainable death. Or it could be the kind of soft tyranny envisioned in 
<br>
Brave New World, in which everyone is healthy and happy but has forgotten 
<br>
the meaning of hope, fear, or struggle. &quot;
<br>
<p>This myth should be debunked.  That Brave New World syndrome keeps popping 
<br>
up.  But, we can use it to our advantage.  We certainly don't want tyranny 
<br>
and we certainly do want a transhumane sensibility.
<br>
<p>Here is another quote:  &quot;True freedom means the freedom of political 
<br>
communities to protect the values they hold most dear, and it is that 
<br>
freedom that we need to exercise with regard to the biotechnology 
<br>
revolution today.&quot;
<br>
<p>I understand his concerns.  I have stated on several occasions, I do not 
<br>
find any one political agenda ultimately compatible with our transhumanist 
<br>
views.  I think there needs to be an alternative way to show the extropian 
<br>
transhumansit perspective on politics.
