<p>Obese, yes, but the other effects appear less significant than aging.
<br>
Would you rather be thin and die at 80 or fat and die at 112?  I like
<br>
being thin, but not *that* much.

Here's a cite:

<p>Flurkey, Kevin; Papaconstantinou, John; Miller, Richard A.; Harrison, David

E..  Lifespan extension and delayed immune and collagen aging in mutant mice
<br>
with defects in growth hormone production. In: Proceedings of the National 
<br>
Academy
<br>
of Sciences of the United States of America June 5, 2001. 98 (12): 6736-6741.

Language: English;  Pub type: JOURNAL ARTICLE
<br>
<p>Abstract: Single-gene mutations that extend lifespan provide valuable tools 
<br>
for the
<br>
exploration of the molecular basis for age-related changes in cell and tissue 
<br>
function and for
<br>
the pathophysiology of age-dependent diseases. We show here that mice h
<br>
omozygous for
<br>
loss-of-function mutations at the Pit1 (Snell dwarf) locus show a &gt;40% 
<br>
increase in mean and
<br>
maximal longevity on the relatively long-lived (C3H/HeJXDW/J)F1 background. 
<br>
Mutant
<br>
&nbsp;dwJ/dw animals show delays in age-dependent collagen cross-linking and in six
<br>
age-sensitive indices of immune system status. These findings thus 
<br>
demonstrate that a single
<br>
gene can control maximum lifespan and the timing of both cellular and 
<br>
extracellular
<br>
senescence in a mammal. Pituitary transplantation into dwarf mice does not 
<br>
reverse the
<br>
lifespan effect, suggesting that the effect is not due to lowered prolactin 
<br>
levels. In contrast,
<br>
homozygosity for the Ghrhrlit mutation, which like the Pit1dw mutation lowers 
<br>
plasma growth
<br>
hormone levels, does lead to a significant increase in longevity. Male Snell 
<br>
dwarf mice,
<br>
unlike calorically restricted mice, become obese and exhibit proportionately 
<br>
high leptin
<br>
levels in old age, showing that their exceptional longevity is not simply due 
<br>
to alterations in
<br>
adiposity per se. Further studies of the Pit1dw mutant, and the closely 
<br>
related, long-lived
<br>
Prop-1df (Ames dwarf) mutant, should provide new insights into the hormonal 
<br>
regulation of
<br>
senescence, longevity, and late life disease.
