<br>
<em>&gt; As you say, there's no industrial quest for human-competitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advent of such systems would throw the labor establishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into (unemployed)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turmoil. Whoever owns the first human-competitive general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence robot,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can soon own everything else.
</em><br>
<p>The developmental history of AI appears to be a classic 'kill me and save
<br>
me' scenario. The Automation bogeyman (and I have been in axactly this field
<br>
for 20 years) didn't kill jobs - it a) Made any single individual a lot more
<br>
productive and b) Changed the nature of the jobs. The problem was in the
<br>
speed at which it occurred - people couldn't change that fast. Hence the
<br>
displacement and the resulting resentment. Those that adapted did well. I
<br>
have observed this in dozens of factories/businesses.
<br>
<p>With this in mind and as an avowed &quot;AI or bust&quot; person I cogitate regularly
<br>
on the issue of impact - both sides - and I confess this is like
<br>
(Automation^^N) in it's impact and it scares me. For example: Computer
<br>
Programming. What's the 'big software project blowout's' overall solution
<br>
and the next programming language? The answer is _not to let humans program
<br>
anything_. There goes computer programming as a profession (I include myself
<br>
in this profession!).
<br>
<p>I just hope that the speed of the change is moderated so that people are OK.
<br>
Sometimes I have nightmare visions of being ostracised at the local market
<br>
and having people throw rocks at my house out of the fear of the
<br>
(potentially) very smart little grey box in my office.
<br>
<p>The original subject matter of the thread was about self financing with
<br>
spin-offs. I think I have to queue up with Eliezer on this...if your goal is
<br>
not really a 100% business goal then the diversionary nature of the business
<br>
process and politics associated with the creation of a spinoff are terribly
<br>
problematic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who will it be, and how long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before religionists call him the Anti-Christ?
</em><br>
<p>Like it or not it looks like I may have applied for the job (along with
<br>
Eliezer and others on the trail). I was born on the right day, too! (25/12)
<br>
Imagine the business card &quot;Colin Hales, AntiChrist. Bring me your
<br>
anti-loaves and anti-fishes&quot;. Seriously - I am fearful and excited all at
<br>
once and have to remain true to the cause. There will be so many things that
<br>
will happen that no-one could even conceive of a-priori that I have to have
<br>
a kind of faith that it's going to be OK. Not easy, but OK. There are truly
<br>
huge potential cultural changes afoot.
<br>
<p>Is it any wonder that VCs could see a marketing nightmare? How do you market
<br>
an Anti-Christ?. I think you don't. I've seen many a developmental paths
<br>
involving trojan horses and stealth, and I think this may have to be one of
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Beware, fellow list members.....is <a href="mailto:xyz@whatever.com?Subject=RE:%20rambling%20question%20on%20AI">xyz@whatever.com</a>, happily bantering with
<br>
you, a human? This is not a joke. The Turing test is for babies. It'll
<br>
happen, and sooner than you think.
<br>
<p>That'll be all from me for a while.
<br>
<p>cheers
<br>
<p>Colin
