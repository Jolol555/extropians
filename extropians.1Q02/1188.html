my taxing me into the ground which it can only do if I continue

to work real hard and not revolt against working half of every

year just to pay it to rob me to pay me much less and pay a

bunch of folks to better manipulate and control me.  What a

wonderful life!

<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Note the first of these links showing the stagnation of

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Our middle class is in great shape.  They have cars, clothes,

<em>&gt; Looks pretty rosy to me Samantha, and Im one of the

<em>&gt; middle class proles that gets up every morning and fights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traffic to get to my job.  Traffic is a good thing.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, surging to get to work and make good things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen!  Its the pulse of a healthy economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I see your Prozac is working.  :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;All of that sounds fine in principle.  But what will you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about the huge debts we are under?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Work hard, pay it off.  Keep your butt to the grindstone.  Builds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character.  Gets things done.  Makes things happen.  Good old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear of economic ruin keeps people off the streets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>How will you pay it off if your government insists on spending 
<br>
more each year and using any surplus in its extorted money taken 
<br>
in to throw a party giving the payers back some of their own 
<br>
cash so they will believe it really is a jolly system after all? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying of the debt is just not very popular politically.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; They are eating away at our properity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prosperity schmosperity.  We have more wealth than we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what to do with.  Something hasta eat it, or we would waste our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives on endless round of masturbation and daytime TV.  Talent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be wasted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>And I thought I was cynical.  I guess I need my dosage adjusted.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What will you do when/if the number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;working and with the means to help those not working goes below
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the amount that by any stretch of the imagination can cover
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;thsoe without jobs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then we will solve that problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Yesh?  How?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; What will you do when the federal debt is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;so high that even the interest on it swamps taxes collected and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;all the boomers retire and expect the money that has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;siphoned off into the debt?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then we will solve that problem.  The underlying wealth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this planet is elegantly sufficient to feed everyone, to feed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrice as many as we now have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Such is the dogma.  Please show how to apply it.  The 
<br>
&quot;underlying wealth&quot; is utterly dependent on the creativity and 
<br>
productivity of human beings being unleashed.  But we are 
<br>
chaining ourselves to an ever larger debt.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;It would be nice if there are clean, easy, straight-forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;answers.  But I do not know of them if there are such.

<em>&gt; Samantha, do not be a gloom-miester.  Our world's problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are many, but for each one there is a gang of big hairy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions waiting to pounce on it.  spike
</em><br>
<p><p>Uh huh.  And at the least we can make light of them and not 
<br>
really talk about them if we can't think of anything better to 
<br>
do.  Right?
