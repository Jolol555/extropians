&nbsp;Citrulline, a novel compatible solute in drought-tolerant wild watermelon
<br>
&nbsp;leaves, is an efficient hydroxyl radical scavenger
<br>
<p>&nbsp;FEBS Letters 508: 438-442 2001
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Abstract: Drought-tolerant wild watermelon accumulates high levels of
<br>
&nbsp;citrulline in the leaves in response to drought conditions. In this work,
<br>
&nbsp;the hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity of citrulline was investigated
<br>
&nbsp;in vitro. The second-order rate constant for the reaction between
<br>
&nbsp;citrulline and hydroxyl radicals was found to be 3,900,000,000 M-1 s-1,
<br>
&nbsp;demonstrating that citrulline is one of the most efficient scavengers
<br>
&nbsp;among compatible solutes examined so far. Moreover, citrulline
<br>
&nbsp;effectively protected DNA and an enzyme from oxidative injuries. Liquid
<br>
&nbsp;chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that at least four
<br>
&nbsp;major products were formed by the reaction between citrulline and
<br>
&nbsp;hydroxyl radicals. Activities of metabolic enzymes were not inhibited by
<br>
&nbsp;up to 600 mM citrulline, indicating that citrulline does not interfere
<br>
&nbsp;with cellular metabolism. We reasoned, from these results, that
<br>
&nbsp;citrulline contributes to oxidative stress tolerance under drought
<br>
&nbsp;conditions as a novel hydroxyl radical scavenger.
