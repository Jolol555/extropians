<p>&lt;&lt; The second sentence requires a pre-Darwinian metaphysics: evolution *per
<br>
&nbsp;se* as teleological. If it *were* so, then punctuated equilibrium (say)
<br>
&nbsp;would not be an observed fact of biological history. Every species would
<br>
&nbsp;have its mutation checkers and repair systems turned down to the very
<br>
&nbsp;lowest set point compatible with individuals surviving barely long enough
<br>
&nbsp;to reproduce and aid offspring (if that is beneficial). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Metaphysics-shmetaphysics. The purpose of life you have well, diagrammed, D. 
<br>
Broderick. Now ask the question this way: What is the purpose of human life? 
<br>
Now ask the Next Question (to quote your fellow writer, Theodore Sturgeon). 
<br>
What is the purpose of post human technological life? I am presupposing that 
<br>
humanity gives birth to successor species. These people I am guessing will 
<br>
completely see themselves as 100% human beings, just augmented, uploaded 
<br>
and/or computer generated, &quot;Why is this primitive sapien being so fussy about 
<br>
our descriptions anyway?&quot; 
<br>
<p>The porpoise of intelligent technological life, says Flipper, is to 
<br>
(ree-ree!) restart the Universe. Thanks for all the fish, but it was Sir 
<br>
Arthur C. who formulated that concept in Songs from Distant Earth. But also 
<br>
George Zebrowski did his part also, I believe. And we shan't forget Isaac the 
<br>
Asimov in his short story, The Final Question. Olaf Stapledon may have had 
<br>
them all beat, in answer to depressed, H.G's The Shape of Thing to Come, with 
<br>
Stapledon's Last and First Men.
<br>
<p>The purpose of current people is to create wiser, kinder, more human and 
<br>
human people (by whatever method) in order to fix or upgrade the universe. 
<br>
This is the meta-goal. We have failed, so far, but let us not be 
<br>
perfectionist, especially when not everyone has been made aware of this 
<br>
philosophy. This would be the work of centuries, or a week and a half, if 
<br>
your SI's ever kick in. 
<br>
<p>Another meta is the search for knowledge in order to enhance enjoyment, and 
<br>
increase the chance for long-term survival (as has been mentioned by just 
<br>
about everyone). Sex is also a meta-goal, but beyond the proper scope of this 
<br>
list. But hey, I through it in, so sue me.
