<p>Ja.  If there were more tech jobs available,

<p><em>&gt; Prices low enough that people don't worry about water except during an

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they'd just raise the prices, we'd use less when the use didn't make sense,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Roger that, big time.  Use should be controlled by markets alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Same as we did during the energy crisis, since it was illegal to raise power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices for consumers.  The social pressure and the race to &quot;cooperate&quot; during
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ja, and the scarier part is we may reelect the same state &quot;government&quot;
<br>
that created these problems before.  If there were more tech jobs
<br>
there, I would leave Taxifornia for Nevada.  spike
