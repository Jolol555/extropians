<em>&gt; From my readings online, there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very little that discusses what happens in between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) useful primer steps like Cyg [Cyc?], Flare, etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) boom! functioning, if very crude general intelligence or seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which I would assume is because no-one really knows for sure (or else we'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be hip deep in AIs by now).
</em><br>
<p>I would say that a &quot;functioning, but very crude GI&quot; *is* an intermediate
<br>
step, if by &quot;functioning but very crude&quot; you mean &quot;the modules are talking
<br>
to each other but the overall system doesn't do anything interesting&quot;.
<br>
<p>To get an &quot;intermediate application&quot; before this point requires that you
<br>
try and implement something less than a GI.  And to do this, you are going
<br>
to have to do different work in different ways than you would if you were
<br>
taking a direct path to general intelligence.  You are going to have to
<br>
expend a lot of effort on building a functioning system only some of which
<br>
will be useful as a way station to GI.  I would be afraid of getting
<br>
bogged down in something that wasn't directly on the road to GI - but
<br>
then, SIAI is a nonprofit and thus has different strategic requirements;
<br>
we can try for seed AI and accept intermediate applications whenever they
<br>
show up, rather than having to convince VCs about the shortsightedness of
<br>
destructive shortcuts.  Peter Voss or Ben Goertzel may have different
<br>
goals and consequently different plans.
<br>
<p>I have to say, though, that one of the largest reasons - maybe even *the*
<br>
largest reasons - why SIAI is a nonprofit is that general intelligence and
<br>
seed AI is pretty much one of the most complicated things in the world,
<br>
and if there's a VC with voting control sitting there and saying &quot;Make
<br>
this simpler so it can go out the door in six months&quot;, then AI is just not
<br>
going to happen there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now if you're walking into a VC's office to pitch an AI company -- one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the few places you're guaranteed not to be the strangest project they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen -- they're going to want to hear how you're going to be generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenue within six months from an initial investment. [Since you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software company, that is, and producing those easy-to-make software things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as opposed to an infrastructure company making those hard-to-make lumps of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iron, but I digress -- lambasting VCs is far too easy].
</em><br>
<p>Six months?  A dream.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you're starting out with something along the lines of a concept, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some useful protocode for classifying information and information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing, possibly even a grasp of the One True Path To AI. What can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce in six months that you can sell? What is the improvement on that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would be coming out in a year?
</em><br>
<p>In six months, you can produce a toy program that is totally off the
<br>
development path to general AI.  I think that's pretty much it.
