<em>&gt; Eliezer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one problem I have had with your published material.  When I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked AI experts at IBM to look at your stuff, they have no idea what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are talking about.  You have invented your own concepts and terminology from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scratch and are not in-step with the rest of the AI community.
</em><br>
<p>Harvey, I'm not sure the rest of the AI community *has* the terminology.  I'm
<br>
currently working on a piece with references intended for more usual
<br>
publication.  Hopefully that will be an easier read for the experts once a
<br>
draft is available.  And I do use more standard terminology now than I did in
<br>
the old days, and define it better, or so I hope.
<br>
<p>But some of the terminology just doesn't exist.  And some, e.g. &quot;LISP
<br>
symbols&quot;, is inherently awful and needs to be replaced, e.g. by &quot;LISP
<br>
tokens&quot;.  I'll send you a URL for the draft the moment it's available, but a
<br>
lot of AI is just *wrong* and this is something to be aware of.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the terminology I do use (especially recently) is drawn more from
<br>
the &quot;brain science&quot; end of cognitive science than the &quot;computer science&quot; end. 
<br>
So even where I use standard terminology, such as &quot;complex functional
<br>
adaptation&quot;, and cite a source, such as Tooby and Cosmides 1992, the average
<br>
AI guy may not recognize it (although the average brain science guy certainly
<br>
will).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is not necessarily a bad thing, it does make it difficult to evaluate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your work.  Most of the experts who look at your website and published stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just shrug their shoulders and walk away.  I have not gotten any meaningful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation from anyone.  If experts can't figure out what you are doing, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see how the lay-transhumanists can figure it out.  I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documenting and sharing your ideas is probably your biggest problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting funding or interest from other groups.
</em><br>
<p>True.  And I am working on this and will hopefully have at least a draft ready
<br>
shortly.  But I am also obliged to consider questions of time, as you
<br>
mention.  Certainly I don't think the field of AI will ever be convinced by
<br>
something short of a demonstration, and we have determined that SIAI's current
<br>
priority is to place the ideas in a form where a solid project could be
<br>
initiated immediately on funding being available - i.e., more internal design
<br>
documents, not more publications, not more evangelism.  What I'm working on
<br>
currently is supposed to be a *brief* departure from those priorities.  We'll
<br>
have to see whether it helps any.
<br>
<p>In truth, I suspect that the new paper, howsoever conforming to the standards
<br>
of academia, will still be harder to read than plain old informal GISAI,
<br>
especially since my goal for this paper is a more complete explanation tied
<br>
into existing theory, rather than a simpler and more approachable explanation.
