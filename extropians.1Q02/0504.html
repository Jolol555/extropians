<br>
<em>&gt; My observation, put for comment, was that it's not A.I. that is the goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with most of the industry out there and that the computational/biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side is mostly what's happening and it's not in a quest for AI.
</em><br>
<p>Your observation is, IMO, one of the most apropos and incisive to appear on
<br>
list, because it points to the fact that economics drives the computer
<br>
industry. There is money to be made by building intelligent robots that can
<br>
manage factories and run businesses and banks. Enormous amounts of money. But
<br>
as soon as a corporate entity proposes such a project, it slams against the
<br>
wall of frightened &quot;relinquishment&quot; alarmists that fears machines will take
<br>
over the world. As far back as the 1950s, alarmists were wringing their hands
<br>
about how automation would put everyone out of work. The absurd (and
<br>
simultaneously ubiquitous) solution to this dilemma was to put half the
<br>
population to work in the government, and the government steadfastly refuses
<br>
to be automated (it can make laws against that!), while using automation to
<br>
generate ever increasing piles of red tape and paperwork to keep everyone
<br>
busy.
<br>
This is a case of &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; with litigation and bureaucratic
<br>
politics replacing the bead game. But a new twist occurred when government
<br>
discovered that it needs computer power for defense. Since Japan (among
<br>
others) has vowed to build the first truly AI system, and a humanoid robot to
<br>
boot, it's a case of &quot;we'd better build one before they do, or we'll be left
<br>
behind&quot; and the new technology war will continue to center on IT and
<br>
intelligent expert systems. Robotics has replaced computers as the hottest new
<br>
field of science, and like PCs twenty years ago, soon everyone will want a
<br>
robot.
<br>
As you say, there's no industrial quest for human-competitive AI, because the
<br>
advent of such systems would throw the labor establishment into (unemployed)
<br>
turmoil. Whoever owns the first human-competitive general intelligence robot,
<br>
can soon own everything else. Who will it be, and how long before religionists
<br>
call him the Anti-Christ?
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
