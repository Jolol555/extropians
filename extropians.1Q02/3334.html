</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;When I first received the advert for this book, from Amazon last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;July, I passed it around our dust group, and nobody in my group
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was interested enough to buy the book.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Review by amazon.com July 2001
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What is dust? It's more than the generic &quot;stuff&quot; that lightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;covers our tabletops if we're not diligent cleaners, writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Hannah Holmes. In fact, dust comes from such exotic places as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;stars, volcanoes, the evaporating seas, the clothing of kings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and even dead people. Sometimes benevolent, sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;destructive, dust is a little bit of everything. Holmes puts all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;kinds of dust under the microscope in this short, sweet book.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Most household 'dust' is pieces of human skin, mites, junk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Finding cosmic dust in your home is not that common. For our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group, when we think of 'dust', it's cosmic, so we have a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an image problem and the book description (above) was discouraging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for us. Secret? Hmm.
</em><br>
<p>I don't blame you, that review sucks...
<br>
<p>I've only just started this book, but it's dealt with little except
<br>
the cosmic origin of dust so far. I thought it was so interesting
<br>
I went to the back to see if your name was listed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The origin of dust is late-evolved stars, and what we have in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solar system is heavily processed material (because the dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lifetime is tens of thousands of years), which is mostly generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from comets and asteroids. 
</em><br>
<p>In the book.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The exciting aspect of dust for us is that we are both observers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the dust evolution process (dust being tracers of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Universe's evolution, like photons), as well as its result. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guessing that the author she didn't go into too much detail about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that ..?
</em><br>
<p>Actually so far the book has talked about little else.
<br>
<p>Don't let that lousy review sway you, at least glance through it at
<br>
a bookstore and give it your professional review.
<br>
<p>I don't have it with me today, but tell you what, if the first 40
<br>
pages don't change your mind, I'll buy you the book.
<br>
<p>In one example they talked about how through optical telescopes
<br>
there were areas that just appeared to be large dust clouds, but
<br>
that an infrared telescope brought to light the fact that such
<br>
clouds were in fact interstellar nurseries, where stars are
<br>
actually formed (I almost said created).
<br>
<p>I thought this made an excellent case to the public for the need of
<br>
such instruments as infrared telescopes.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;We know all the labels, but never taste the wine&quot; 
<br>
<p>Deal stands...
