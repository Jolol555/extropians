<p>New Prospects for Putting Organs on Ice
<br>
<p>Jocelyn Kaiser
<br>
<p>After a lull, scientists are again exploring vitrification and other
<br>
techniques for deep-freezing tissues and organs
<br>
<p>In the movie Vanilla Sky, Tom Cruise has his broken body frozen in the
<br>
hope that he'll someday be revived and healed. In reality, cryonics, as
<br>
this practice is known, remains the most speculative science fiction.
<br>
Researchers have failed for decades to deep-freeze and thaw most
<br>
tissues--let alone organs or animals--without damaging them, often
<br>
seriously. But recently, a few cryobiologists have celebrated successes
<br>
with ovaries and complex tissues like vascular grafts.
<br>
<p>The work has sparked hope that donated organs can eventually be banked for
<br>
longer than the current few days, which would buy time for distributing
<br>
them and finding recipients who are good immunological matches. And as
<br>
progress is made engineering artificial livers, bladders, and other
<br>
tissues containing living cells, the need for better preservation
<br>
techniques is expected to grow (see Viewpoint on p. 1009). &quot;Each company
<br>
at some point will need to store and transport their product,&quot; says Mike
<br>
Taylor of Organ Recovery Systems in Charleston, South Carolina.
<br>
<p>Currently, transplant surgeons perfuse whole organs with a special
<br>
solution that enables them to be banked just above 0ºC for up to a few
<br>
days. Ideally, they would like to preserve organs at -196ºC, the boiling
<br>
point of liquid nitrogen--so cold that molecular motion virtually stops
<br>
and tissues cease to decay. Half a century ago, that seemed within easy
<br>
reach. Scientists found that blood and sperm could survive such deep
<br>
freezing if mixed with glycerol. The glycerol lowers the cells' freezing
<br>
point and keeps them from getting lethally salty when they do freeze and
<br>
water diffuses out. And since 1972, embryos have been frozen with liquid
<br>
nitrogen and later successfully implanted.
<br>
<p>Organs, however, don't hold up so well below the freezing point. Water
<br>
leaked from cells during freezing forms ice crystals in the space between
<br>
cells, and this ice destroys fragile structures such as ducts and blood
<br>
vessels. Sometimes pieces of organs, such as pancreatic islet cells, work
<br>
adequately after freezing. But larger, more complex organs such as kidneys
<br>
don't function properly when sufficiently ravaged.
<br>
<p>As a way around this problem, some researchers turned to vitrification, or
<br>
&quot;ice-free&quot; cryopreservation. The idea is to fill the organ with a viscous
<br>
fluid that turns into a glassy (not crystalline) solid at low
<br>
temperatures. This reduces the problems of ice, but toxicity of the
<br>
cryopreservant can still damage organs. And ice crystals tend to form as
<br>
vitrified tissue--especially large pieces--is warmed. Partial success came
<br>
in the 1980s, when Red Cross scientist Greg Fahy showed that rabbit
<br>
kidneys could withstand the high concentrations of cryoprotectants needed
<br>
to vitrify these organs. They worked when reimplanted, but Fahy had only
<br>
cooled them to -3ºC. Many experiments later, it's clear that
<br>
&quot;vitrification is very, very complicated,&quot; says cryobiologist David Pegg
<br>
of the University of York, U.K., and in most labs vitrification of large
<br>
organs has been on hold.
<br>
<p>Recently, cryobiologists have had better luck studying vitrification on a
<br>
smaller scale. For example, fine-tuning the solutions that are injected
<br>
into the organs, as well as heating and cooling rates, minimized injury to
<br>
2- to 3-centimeter-long pieces of rabbit veins, Taylor's team at Organ
<br>
Recovery Systems reported in the 18 March 2000 issue of Nature
<br>
Biotechnology. The vessels retained 80% of their function when dosed with
<br>
drugs that cause them to contract, compared to 20% following simple
<br>
freezing. When implanted in rabbits, the grafts appeared to work normally.
<br>
&quot;We're the first to demonstrate [that vitrification works better than
<br>
freezing] in reasonably complex tissue,&quot; Taylor says. Two other groups
<br>
have recently shown that they can vitrify corneas, getting much less
<br>
damage than from freezing. But the scientists have yet to show whether
<br>
these corneas function in vivo.
<br>
<p>Roger Gosden and colleagues at McGill University in Montreal have had
<br>
success even with conventional freezing with a small organ, they reported
<br>
last month in Nature. They froze rat ovaries, fallopian tubes, and
<br>
attached blood vessels in liquid nitrogen and transplanted them into
<br>
genetically identical rats whose ovaries had been removed. The animals
<br>
ovulated. Some ice damage occurred, so vitrification might be even more
<br>
successful, suggests Gosden, now at the Jones Institute for Reproductive
<br>
Medicine in Norfolk, Virginia.
<br>
<p>Several groups are tackling problems that thwart both vitrification and
<br>
conventional freezing. Pegg's group at York, for instance, is working on
<br>
how to thaw tissues and avoid ice crystal formation. The team has
<br>
developed a technique that Pegg says can evenly and quickly heat pingpong
<br>
ball-sized clumps of cells embedded in gelatin to simulate large tissue.
<br>
Taylor's group, meanwhile, is collaborating with Carnegie Mellon
<br>
scientists on dosing tissues with iron compounds that are then excited
<br>
with magnets to generate heat.
<br>
<p>Taking a cue from nature, researchers are also using natural antifreeze
<br>
proteins to help mop up crystals formed during freezing and thawing. Many
<br>
organisms, from carrots to fish to beetles, produce proteins that latch
<br>
onto and isolate growing ice crystals. The one drawback is that at
<br>
temperatures well below 0ºC, this system can backfire by causing ice
<br>
crystals to form spikes that disrupt cells. Several companies are
<br>
developing improved synthetic versions of these &quot;ice blockers&quot;; for
<br>
example, Taylor's company hopes to produce smaller molecules that attach
<br>
to ice crystals at the base as well as the face, which could prevent spike
<br>
formation.
<br>
<p>Fahy, meanwhile, has never given up trying to vitrify large organs. &quot;He
<br>
has soldiered the way on this for years and years,&quot; Pegg says. Now at a
<br>
company called 21st Century Medicine in Rancho Cucamonga, California, Fahy
<br>
has tested hundreds of vitrification solutions and patented the most
<br>
promising ones. &quot;Greg has always been tantalizingly close to getting it to
<br>
work,&quot; says cryobiologist William Rall of the National Institutes of
<br>
Health. The company Fahy works for receives funding from the Life
<br>
Extension Foundation, which supports cryonics. Fahy says his work is
<br>
strictly limited to cryopreserving organs. But he adds, &quot;If I'm
<br>
successful, perhaps it will remove some of the [cryonics] controversy.&quot;
