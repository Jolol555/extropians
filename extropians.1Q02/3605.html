From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Hakim%20Bey%20(was:%20RE:%20virtual%20nation%20building)">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; I see what Eliezer is doing as attempting create a &quot;way out&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an otherwise fatally dangerous and unstoppable technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run-away.  This is done by guided technological means.  It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing specific to do with &quot;cultural activism&quot; unless this term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is used in a way I am not familar with.  Eliezer says (correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by his thinking) almost nothing about social/political goals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues.  They are seen as distractions from the essential work.
</em><br>
<p>It was admittedly an unfortunate choice of words because I did intend
<br>
'cultural activism' in a more inclusive sense than its standard usage. To
<br>
say 'singularity activist/passivist seems a little too insular. Perhaps
<br>
'transhumanist activist/passivist is closer, but not without its pitfalls as
<br>
well. My argument with Bey (and thus Anders) is that the issue of passivity
<br>
was not framed properly. The most relevant issue, as I see it, proceeds from
<br>
this line of reasoning: The transhumanist (or singularity) revolution is
<br>
coming soon, we can have no predictable effect on its shape or outcome, so
<br>
we might as well just kick back. Or the variant: since we can have no
<br>
predictable effect on the revolution's outcome we have no special obligation
<br>
as to how it ought to come about, at best we need simply ensure that it does
<br>
come about. I don't think that Eliezer subscribes to either line of
<br>
reasoning although I think many do, if not in word then in deed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neo-Heideggerian understanding of passivity suggested by Bey seems
<br>
to me to miss the point. For the hordes of Heideggerians on this list I
<br>
would say that &quot;the question of technology&quot; in its complicity with Dasein's
<br>
age of world pictures maybe irrelevant since we (hopefully) will enter a
<br>
postDasein error. (That is, technology may well have played a role in the
<br>
cultural relativism self-understanding of humans in the modern era, but this
<br>
may be irrelevant as we enter a posthuman era).  Mark
