Hello extropians.
<br>
<p>I've been absent from this list for a long time, so let me re-introduce myself.
<br>
<p>My name is Joost de Lijser, am a 30 years old European of Dutch 
<br>
nationality, living in
<br>
Brussels, Belgium. I dropped out of a higher teachers education in History, 
<br>
to go work
<br>
in the music industry, where i've worked in many sectors, but mainly as a 
<br>
discjockey.
<br>
With varying success, which is why i had many jobs in the music industry on 
<br>
the side
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>When i first joined this list some years ago, i was new to the internet and 
<br>
mailinglists as well
<br>
as to Extropy and Libertarianism. I left the list because at that time i 
<br>
had other priorities in
<br>
my life (a new job, which was very mailinglist intense, and my modem wasn't 
<br>
up to it), but
<br>
i have had (and spent) a lot of time to process the huge amounts of 
<br>
information i received here,
<br>
and further develop my opinions on many of the subjects.
<br>
<p>I've also come to understand the defensive and sometimes agressive stance 
<br>
on libertarian
<br>
issues of some of the listmembers. Being a European i had very little 
<br>
knowlegde of
<br>
libertarianism when i first joined this list, today i consider myself 
<br>
Libertarian. Since i left
<br>
i've read Friedmans machinery of freedom, and can honestly say it has been 
<br>
the most
<br>
important book in my life. I thoroughly enjoy discussing propertarian 
<br>
anarchism with
<br>
colleagues and friends, most of whom are left-wing anarchists or socialists 
<br>
(and who
<br>
always seem to disagree), but i miss the discussions here.
<br>
<p>For an &quot;artist&quot; i'm very down to earth, i value art on its beauty or 
<br>
message more than
<br>
on its context or explanations. In my own music i use some themes that are 
<br>
related to
<br>
transhumanism, but art itself i haven't tried or been able to connect or 
<br>
explain from
<br>
the viewpoint of a transhuman, libertarian or extropian life philosophy. I 
<br>
was about to
<br>
explore this when i left the list, and would like to pick it up, can 
<br>
someone point me
<br>
to some sites on this subject matter ?
<br>
<p>At the moment i'm also trying to focus my opinions on intellectual property 
<br>
and privacy.
<br>
It's definitely the more abstract parts of society i am still struggling 
<br>
with, i do have
<br>
opinions about them, but they remain unstructured. If some of you are 
<br>
interested
<br>
in my first attempts to structure them, you can read them at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.ffwd.to/future/">http://www.ffwd.to/future/</a>,
<br>
any feedback as well as links to other peoples opinions are more than welcome.
<br>
<p>This list has influenced and helped me structure my opinions in the past, 
<br>
and i'm looking
<br>
forward to share information and opinions with all of you once again.
<br>
<p>happy new year,
<br>
<p>Joost.
