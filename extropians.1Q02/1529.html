<p>Hmmm, &quot;jones&quot;.  Ive never cared for that terminology.  {8^D
<br>
<p>Cryonics does add some weirdness to the equation.  One of the things
<br>
that smoking does is to increase one's chances of cancer.  If one is a
<br>
hardcore believer in cryonics (Im not. softcore believer maybe) then
<br>
cancer is one of your best chances of getting out of this life alive.  The
<br>
reasoning is that if you get one of the bad uncurable cancers, such as
<br>
of the lung, then you have plenty of advance notice of your own demise,
<br>
and are more likely to make the appropriate arrangements and be
<br>
down in Phoenix when your time comes. {Unlike me, who is more
<br>
likely to perish in an unrecoverable manner in a smoldering heap
<br>
of aluminum in some distant place.}
<br>
<p>Then of course there is the possibility that nanosanta will come
<br>
along and fix the damage.  And if Eliezer is right, the Singularity
<br>
will come along before the now-young will accumulate very much
<br>
risk.
<br>
<p>Note that I am not (way not) suggesting that Animated keep
<br>
smoking, far from it.  But I would not be surprised that in 20
<br>
years we are enough closer to nanosanta/singularity/cryonic
<br>
reanimation that we stop running all the antitobacco ads.  spike
