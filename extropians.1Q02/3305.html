Hi,
<br>
<p>although the idea of a currency based on energy started as a joke (or what seems like it) on the Extropians group, I think it has
<br>
some validity as a currency system.
<br>
<p><p>Since we can quantify energy quite easily, I think we can seriously consider a currency based on energy. A currency based on
<br>
apparently valuable things like gold and silver would rely too much on subjective valuing and one based on a government can prove
<br>
unreliable.
<br>
<p>I suggest that we base our measures on something quantifiable and based in the &quot;real&quot; world, and immutable to change and as immune
<br>
from politics as possible. Energy seems to fulfil this creiteria, thanks to no small measure by the Laws of Thermodynamics.
<br>
<p><p>We can consider the price of a process or a product equivalent to the amount of energy needed to produce it. Let's take the original
<br>
value of everything as nil, the potential energy value as 100% and then as we do something to it (like building cars, houses and
<br>
space colonies) we transfer the potential value to our own use.
<br>
<p>The universe would act as our natural resource for us to convert energy from one form to another, extracting utility from it while
<br>
degarding it by decreasing its future utility. When &quot;mining&quot; energy, high entropy energy (such as heat) has lesser or nil prices,
<br>
and low entropy ones like visible light commands a higher price. Energy density varies minute from microwave radiation, small from
<br>
oil combustion to 100% from antimatter.
<br>
<p><p>As we develop more and more advanced technology, our productivity increases both by evolution (such as increased productivity by
<br>
doing more with less) and revolution (by attaining things that previously we cannot do). Our energy economy would increase in size
<br>
along with at least technological and population factors.
<br>
<p>With the advanced technology of the future, we might realise Einstein's E=MC^2 for almost all kinds of matter (perhaps except those
<br>
trapped in black holes). When that happens, you will have to pay a lot more for atoms than for normal energy, so make sure you hoard
<br>
some matter (like your own body) today.
<br>
<p><p>Have a nice day.
