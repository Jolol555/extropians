Subject: Re: CLIMATE: Cooling, not warming...

<p><p><em>&gt; Note the cycles, being astrophysically constant, explain only why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual ice ages come and go.  They don't do anything to explain why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we suddenly started having ice ages a few million years ago, or why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall trend for the last few tens of millions of years had been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooling trend.
</em><br>
<p>I think the best explanation for this (the most parsimonious one) is plate
<br>
tectonics. For the bulk of the period you mention the Antarctic continent
<br>
has been parked over the South Pole. As well as acting like a giant
<br>
refrigerator this has locked up masses of fresh water and made the whole
<br>
planet both colder and drier. At the same time tectonic movement around the
<br>
Arctic has effectively isolated that ocean from the rest of the world's
<br>
oceans (there are only two deep water passages into the Arctic, both very
<br>
narrow). The result is it's very cold and instead of warming the circumpolar
<br>
region keeps it in the &quot;arctic&quot; climate we know today. That is why an ice
<br>
age is the default climate setting at this (geological) moment. It only
<br>
takes a few years of unusually heavy winters and cold summers, given the
<br>
conditions in the holarctic, to raise the planet's albedo substantially and
<br>
lower the average temperature by enough to start an ice age. After that it
<br>
doesn't take long at all for the fully fledged ice age conditions to appear.
<br>
When an interglacial arrives it takes longer for all that ice to melt. Steve

<br>
<em>&gt; The best explanation for _that_ which I've seen is the Himalaya
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis: the continuous and large supply of uplifted fresh rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been scrubbing CO2 out of the atmosphere.   (CO2 and rain react with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rock in the natural weathering process.)
