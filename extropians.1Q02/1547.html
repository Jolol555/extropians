<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;many people are driven by envy and care about relative standing.  I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that that gives the argument moral weight.  Some people are doing very well at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;improving the lives of others, and they're being compensated very well for it.
</em><br>
<p>And Peter responded:
<br>
<em>&gt; A society in which a large fraction of rewards go to a handful of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who become the best tennis player or the best movie star is a society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which in which a large number of people take big risks to become one of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handful, and it is a society in which most of the people who make that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt fail to achieve what they want.
</em><br>
<p>And who do they hurt when that happens?  And who benefits?  
<br>
<p>I think the answers are that some people are sad that they didn't become the
<br>
best, and most enjoy the pursuit.  Many people benefit from the side effects
<br>
of the competition.  Entertainment, improved products, better prices, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's why life is so much better for everyone, including the worst off.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  Everyone? Do you deny that there are people who have lost their job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security due to economic change? 
</em><br>
<p>When I said everyone is better off, I didn't mean compared to their neighbors,
<br>
as that is clearly impossible.  I meant compared to anyone 200 years ago or
<br>
500 or 1000.  I don't deny that people have lost job security.  But the poor
<br>
in this country are filth rich by any long term measure.  The poor in other
<br>
countries that are relatively free have access to tremendous resources because
<br>
other people are doing their best and being rewarded for it.  
<br>
<p>As an aside, do you think that job security is an asset that someone can own? 
<br>
Why is it relevant to this discussion?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you deny that there are people whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pristine view of lake Tahoe has become less valuable because someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became wealthy enough to build another house within that view?
</em><br>
<p>No.  Why do you ask?
<br>
<p><p>And in the middle of Peter's message, he said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  That's why the arguments in Luxury Fever imply that there are negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; externalities associated with celebrity-worship. Since I don't see any way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to internalize those externalities, I therefore believe that a moral system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which creates social pressure to make choices that reduce inequality will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce a nicer society than a moral system that claims inequality doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter. Most of the choices that affect inequality aren't as simple as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choosing whether to worship celebrities, but that doesn't make them any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less important.
</em><br>
<p>I'll grant that there is something to this argument.  It doesn't seem like it
<br>
makes the case for much more than subtle social pressure.  The pressure to do
<br>
well, the desire to be the best at what one does have positive externalities
<br>
as well.  We don't encourage people to do their best by pushing for outcomes
<br>
to be less dependent on results.  
<br>
<p>Convincing people that they don't need to be as rich as Croesus to be wealthy
<br>
by any reasonable measure seems a fine meme.  But this line of argument
<br>
usually seems to be pushing toward convincing those who are relatively wealthy
<br>
that it's their fault that other people are unhappy.  That seems mistaken to me.
<br>
