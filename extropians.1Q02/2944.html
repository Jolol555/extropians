Mike, what you say might be a tricky way to observe the ETs, however, the
<br>
real trick is to find a means where we can sustain the knowledge. It may be
<br>
that your proposals has been tried dozens of times and we have discovered
<br>
the existence of nanobots each time. The trouble of course is that each time
<br>
the nanobots destroy the relevant knowledge. For example, they erase the
<br>
physical records and replace the memories of conducting the experiment with
<br>
something else. Think of the ET nanobots as akin to a virus. We need
<br>
something that would discover and purge the virus in one fell swoop. Here's
<br>
a sad thought: everytime our civilization verges on discovering nano and
<br>
SIAI history is reset. Imagine that the nanobots destroy all the
<br>
infrastructure of our civilization and recreate the world as it was in 495
<br>
BC.  Presumably many people would have to be purged, since there are so many
<br>
more today, and those that remained would have to have their memories
<br>
altered. Bummer. Mark.
<br>
Mark.
