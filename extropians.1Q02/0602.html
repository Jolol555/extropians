<p>
Do James Hughes's opinions represent those of the WTA?  Well... speaking
<br>
as a member of the ten-member Executive Committee of the WTA, which is the
<br>
body analogous to the Board of Directors... I don't actually know just
<br>
yet!  Of course, in formal terms, Hughes is speaking strictly in his
<br>
capacity as a private person; I expect that the question on everyone's
<br>
minds is the extent to which Hughes's views may be reflected in the WTA.
<br>
<p>I do get the impression that Hughes is putting a lot of work into the
<br>
WTA's setup as a nonprofit and that he may even be the chief driving force
<br>
behind the incorporation, i.e., the one who's willing to do all the
<br>
remaining work after the volunteers are accounted for.  But if Hughes
<br>
himself feels that his views on the negative aspects of Extropianism
<br>
should be kept separate from the ecumenicalism of the World Transhumanist
<br>
Association, then it's possible that the non-ecumenical aspect of Hughes's
<br>
views (his expressed negative outlook on Extropianism, the Singularity, et
<br>
cetera) will not appear in the WTA's literature, position statements, and
<br>
so on.  This is, I think, the attitude Hughes himself would claim to take,
<br>
though of course it remains to be seen how it works out in practice.
<br>
<p>Obviously I expect the WTA to remain ecumenical in practice as well as
<br>
theory, or I wouldn't have agreed to serve on the WTA's Executive
<br>
Committee.  Certainly I wouldn't stick around if the WTA began issuing
<br>
position papers which described the Singularity as passivist
<br>
millennialism, or if the language of the WTA's papers began to reflect
<br>
this as an assumption.  James Hughes is just one person.  Right now,
<br>
insofar as I would associate the WTA with any one individual, I would
<br>
associate it with Nick Bostrom.  And for that matter I wouldn't associate
<br>
the WTA too much with any one individual at all, because I think the WTA
<br>
is (in intent, and in practice) more diverse as an organization, more
<br>
reflective of the members rather than the founders, as compared to ExI or
<br>
SIAI or Foresight - the WTA will have a membership structure and an
<br>
elected Board, and so on.
