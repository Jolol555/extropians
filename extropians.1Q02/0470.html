&lt;&lt;Imagine the fear one has when bungie jumping. Now remove the cord
<br>
and remove the Earth below, so you're in an eternal freefall. No
<br>
possiblity of a foot-hold or a person to 'fix' it. That's
<br>
bungie-jumping-fear multiplied a million times. Or, imagine being
<br>
somewhere where you don't have your culture, your language, your
<br>
family, your friends. Again, you are faced with a  complete
<br>
nothingness and then 'you'. Terrifying.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That statement reminds me of a Simpson episode where Bart, after hearing a 
<br>
lecture on a description of the tortures of hell, asked the Sunday school 
<br>
teacher: &quot;Well wouldn't you eventually get used to it?&quot;  The Sunday school 
<br>
teacher character, pausing for a long moment, says &quot;no.&quot;
<br>
<p>The abyss, I suspect, is connected to something similar to a dream (if it 
<br>
isn't a lucid dream, after-all), is connected with a loss of perspective.  
<br>
The perspective is suddenly, one is in panic-mode. Panic-mode usually doesn't 
<br>
produce the most creative of responses, nor it usually the mother of 
<br>
inventions. So perhaps the abyss is a brain function based in our primate 
<br>
past (not that we are post primate now)?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Can
<br>
you imagine being a 'brain in a vat' and not having a sense of who
<br>
you are? What is the driving force (without the supports and/or
<br>
distractions) that makes you jump out of bed every morning ? That's
<br>
what facing the abyss is about.
<br>
<p>Amara &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I associate the abyss with (again) panic-mode. It usually takes cognition to 
<br>
be able to decide what one's options can be. Pani-mode means to me, that the 
<br>
past and the future do not exist, only the experience of the now, which I am 
<br>
typifying as flight, rather then fight.
