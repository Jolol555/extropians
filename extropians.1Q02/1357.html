I probably should elaborate upon my earlier reaction to T0M's two comments
<br>
to me:
<br>
<p>At 05:34 PM 1/18/02 EST, T0Morrow wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think you care too much what I think if you feel compelled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to seek a &quot;ruling&quot; about my opinion.  That game is not worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the candle, as my opinion carries no official weight.
</em><br>
<p>It wasn't a game, BTW, and I still have my candle. :)
<br>
<p>In case any wickless goose gets the misleading impression that my request
<br>
for a `ruling' was evidence of hardened authoritarianism and benighted
<br>
socialist tendencies, think again. The exchange between me and T0M occurred
<br>
in a private forum paid for and structured (or so I understand) by the
<br>
Extropian Institute, headed by Max More and a board of directors. I'm not a
<br>
member, and have never paid a penny, so I regard my presence here as a
<br>
privilege. T0M's opinion, he tells us, carries no official weight, but he
<br>
is the person who coined the term `extropy' and, I gather, was instrumental
<br>
with Dr More in forming the organization. Had Mike Lorrey or Spike Jones or
<br>
Jack Sprat made his comment questioning the salience of my recent posts on
<br>
Pfizer's new drug subsidization policy, I'd have responded differently
<br>
*because they obviously have no official weight* (and in Spike's case no
<br>
weight of any kind, except for the woolen suit).
<br>
<p>I do think it's appropriate that somebody keep an eye on the general tenor
<br>
of posts, and caution or even weed out anyone who posts entirely irrelevant
<br>
material. If a naive Christian apologist or `Creation scientist' or
<br>
$cientologist or Nazi started plaguing the list and wouldn't shut up, I'd
<br>
be in there urging his or her expulsion. But I'd be aware that it's a
<br>
private list, so that my opinion (while carrying at least *some*
<br>
reputational weight by now, I'd hope) is finally irrelevant; it comes down
<br>
to what the list owners think. This list is not founded in egalitarian
<br>
democracy but in private ownership agorocracy. Or so it appears. Well,
<br>
cool; and given that fact, adjudication is not authoritarianism, and it's
<br>
worth a few candles. I've got mine ready, with the end sharpened.
