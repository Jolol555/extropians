<em>&gt; I don't think this description can be correct.  You make it sound like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing the filter over here causes instantaneous observable changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the interference fringes over there.  Clearly this would contradict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativity, which you say the experiment does not do.  Presumably there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is some need to bring the photons (or at least information about them)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together after the experiment in order to observe the changes in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference fringes.  In that case there is an ordinary causal link
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between changing the filter and the observed changes, due to particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which had passed through the filter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal

<p>As they say, there is no paradox here since the determination of coincident 
<br>
events can only be made _after_ the records of the 'clicks' at both near (signal) 
<br>
and remote (idler) detectors are compared, and only _then_ the appearance 
<br>
or disappearance of interference fringes become apparent. 
<br>
<p>Bringing together these records requires the propagation of signals through 
<br>
classical channels, at a speed limited by 'c' . Hence there is no conflict 
<br>
with the postulates of the theory of relativity (_informations_ cannot travel 
<br>
faster than 'c', but _influences_ could do that, of course).
<br>
<p>Perhaps it is also not correct to say that the experimenter's arbitrary choice 
<br>
of the remote and space-like separated fillter (idler) _caused_ the collapse 
<br>
of the (signal) photon wavepacket, on the near side.
<br>
<p>That's because 'No elementary quantum phenomenon is a phenomenon until 
<br>
it is a recorded phenomenon' (J.A. Wheeler, after Bohr). Thus we can encrease 
<br>
the distance of the filter (idler remote side), from the source, as much as we can. 
<br>
This way we are sure that, on the near side, the signal collapsing wave packet 
<br>
could not have known _in advance_ which was the setting of that filter (idler
<br>
remote side). Nevertheless we find that the signal collapsing wave packet, on 
<br>
the near side, depends on that _subsequent_ setting on the filter on the remote 
<br>
idler side  ('delayed choice principle'). 'No elementary quantum phenomenon is 
<br>
a phenomenon until it is a recorded phenomenon'.
<br>
<p>Only nonlocal and uncaused, out of time correlations-at-a-distance are predicted 
<br>
by quantum theory. This may have something to do with the time-symmetrical
<br>
Schroedinger wave equation. Just measurements, or recordings, introduce
<br>
a time-asymmetry (irreversibility). Now, between measurements, between 
<br>
recordings, we can have two opposite time arrows (quantum phenomena may 
<br>
feel past and future at the same time, I mean: past measurement and future
<br>
measurement).
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p>-s.
<br>
<p>An interesting two-photon 'ghost' image effect was found by Shih (et. al.)
<br>
[in Experimental Metaphysics, Boston Studies in the Philosophy of
<br>
Science, vol. 193, Kluwer Academic Publ., 1997]. A pair of signal and
<br>
idler entangled photons (PDC generated) is propagated to different
<br>
directions and detected by two distant detectors. A mask (i.e. with
<br>
these letters: LOVE), is illuminated by the _signal_ beam. Surprisingly 
<br>
an image of that mask, with those letters (LOVE), is observed by scanning 
<br>
the _idler_ detector.
