<p>Ya, I think that if done from birth, if you could make it a fundamental 
<br>
cultural change, sure.  What's the chances of that happening in the near-
<br>
term in the face of the apparent resurgence of fundmental religious 
<br>
beliefs?  But it's not even just a matter of engaging in sex.  The 
<br>
psychological turmoil is there with or without the act.  And you'll never 
<br>
stop it altogether, so some will be gettin it and some won't, which 
<br>
creates even more problems at the unit level.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Come to think of it isn't &quot;proper&quot; sex just a matter of the correct
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; professionalism?
</em><br>
<p>In an ideal world, yes.  Practically speaking &quot;sex&quot;, with or without 
<br>
actual physical contact, would be highly disruptive to a frontline combat 
<br>
unit.  That may change over time.  But frankly, by the time most people 
<br>
change the way they view and control their male/female sexual 
<br>
relationships, we'll be far more technologically advanced.  Warfare itself 
<br>
will have changed, making the close association of men and women on the 
<br>
battlefield less an issue.  There are strong trends today towards making 
<br>
the individual soldier much more autonomous, much more mobile, and much 
<br>
more capable.  Wireless technologies, augmented reality, smart munitions, 
<br>
even things like exoskeletons, Solo-Trek and Segway technologies will 
<br>
dramatically change infantry combat.  Hell, that's certainly one of the 
<br>
things Heinlein foresaw so long ago with the Mobile Infantry.  Individual 
<br>
soldiers miles and miles apart capable of great levels of destruction.  
<br>
We're not far from that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is brainstorming by the way.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I spent mid '76 to mid 78 with VMA(AW)533 at Cherry Point N.C and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Swing with the wing.  :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yeah the original still had the sexes rigorously separated aboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ship, maybe Heinlein was smarter than us, but I thought the movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version with it's integrated units was very thought provoking. (And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a great shower scene ;) )
</em><br>
<p>Everytime I shower at the gym I dream of that future reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay, lets play with the concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We segregate men and women in the military now to avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of potentially complicating sexual encounters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now if we are to be fair and permit gays and lesbians to serve,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where are you going to put them?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It isn't fair to put the Gays with the &quot;straights&quot;, or the Lesbians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the &quot;Straights&quot; and you can't put Gays with Gays, and Lesbians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Lesbians for the same reasons!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ball in your court...
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I never said I had all the answers.  I don't know.  I'm glad I 
<br>
don't have to deal with that particular issue in a frontline combat unit.  
<br>
The leadership challenges required to keep a lid on things and 
<br>
accomplish the mission would be monumental.  There needs to 
<br>
be some major cultural shifts before it would be accomplished without 
<br>
major degradation of combat effectiveness.  But again, I think that in the 
<br>
next ten to twenty years the face of individual combat will have changed 
<br>
so dramatically as to make it a moot point.  The main issue is what 
<br>
happens in the near term, and I don't know how you're going to overcome 
<br>
the cultural biases and prejudices that make it a highly divisive issue.  
<br>
And divisive issues make for poor unit cohesion and esprit.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I agree that readiness is first and foremost and must be maintained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at any cost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think of the idea of creating some integrated units as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an experiment? You'd get plenty of volunteers I bet!
</em><br>
<p>Well, sure.  The Navy is integrated.  The Air Force is or almost is, and 
<br>
the Army is a lot more integrated than the Marines.  Desert Storm was an 
<br>
interesting experiment.  And the reports weren't all that good, though I 
<br>
haven't seen any scientific evaluations of the problems.  Lots of 
<br>
pregnancies resulted in a lot of women being taken out of operational 
<br>
positions because they couldn't perform.  That in itself created problems 
<br>
among the men who had to stay and take up the slack.  But if they're as 
<br>
good looking as those Canadian soldiersJames was talking about, 
<br>
definitely.  :)

Who thinks that Starship Troopers &lt;the movie&gt; was about the worst

adaptation of a fantastic book as I've ever seen.
