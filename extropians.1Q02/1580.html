<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;…you continue to position extropian thinking as necessarily libertarian.
</em><br>
[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt;Libertarian views fit with those principles extremely well. But those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principles do not exclusively require a libertarian view. While they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly do exclude highly statist views (which presumably would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allowed in the WTA), they are compatible with non-libertarian views where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those are clearly intended to support self-direction and maintain an open 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society.
</em><br>
<p>OK, my analysis was far from subtle, I know…  I did originally mention that 
<br>
I was going to put it &quot;rather brutally&quot; when I proposed that 
<br>
extropy=CMT+libertarianism... ;-)
<br>
<p>Would it be fair to say, then, that libertarianism is one of the (if not 
<br>
*the*) main political influence on the politics of the extropian movement? 
<br>
Perhaps, followed in importance by humanism and/or liberalism (in the 
<br>
european sense)?
<br>
<p>Anyway, whatever the political influences of the extropian philosophy or 
<br>
transhumanism in general, what’s important (for the purposes of this post) 
<br>
is that all of those political views are already out there, all already well 
<br>
represented by a number of parties and organisations.
<br>
<p>IF the above is correct, then the following thinking-out-loud might make 
<br>
sense to you (especially the last paragraphs):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This relative ease of “adoptability” of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; CMT is something we should be very aware of,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but it is not a bad thing: it will make life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; harder for the emerging anti-CMT alliance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have no objection to what you are saying here, estropico. By &quot;CMT&quot; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe you are referring to the idea that we can use technology to alter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the human condition. I agree that such a view can and probably will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combined with socio-political views that are neither libertarian nor even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individualistic or democratic. Nationalist, racist, collectivist, and even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious forms of transhumanism seem possible.
</em><br>
<p>I am glad you are aware of these possibilities.
<br>
This is an important point, IMHO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If that should happen, ExI will be especially important in fostering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom in connection with transhumanism. ExI could ally with other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transhumanist organizations to jointly promulgate freedom-friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transhumanism. We might have narrow, tactical alliances with less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom-friendly forms of transhumanism to the extent that this enables us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to stand firm again potentially powerful anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanists [snip]
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely on what the role and strategy of *ExI* should be.
<br>
<p>However…
<br>
<p>My intent here is to post an advance warning to the transhumanist community: 
<br>
if and when transhumanist ideas (or, more specifically, the CMT) will go 
<br>
mainstream, the original transhumanist organisations such as ExI and the WTA 
<br>
risk finding themselves marginalised by those larger and more established 
<br>
organisations that will have, by then, more or less adopted the CMT (despite 
<br>
the inevitable internal splits and arguments). The more established 
<br>
organisations I am referring to, are no other than the present-day 
<br>
centre-right and center-left parties and other, smaller, political groups. 
<br>
Since transhumanism does not offer any *novel* political views, as far as I 
<br>
can see  (please correct me if I’m missing something!) once the CMT is out 
<br>
of the equation, the transhumanist movement would not have much left to 
<br>
offer that wasn’t already being offered by other, more established, 
<br>
organisations.
<br>
<p>All this brings me to another (and rather delicate) question that’s been 
<br>
bothering me for a while: given all of the above, wouldn’t it make tactical 
<br>
sense to set up a pro-CMT pression group whose politics was very limited 
<br>
(say to the acceptance of western-style democracy) so to have broader 
<br>
appeal? (Could Pro-Act fit the bill?) This should not be in direct 
<br>
competition with more politically defined organisations such as ExI, but I, 
<br>
for one, would definitely consider a double membership. The advantages I see 
<br>
in such a CMT-only organisation would be to be free of the political infight 
<br>
that seems  typical in transhumanist circles and, more importantly, to 
<br>
appear as  less “controversial” and more acceptable to the general public. 
<br>
It could be a very useful tool in accelerating the  “mainstreaming” of the 
<br>
central meme of transhumanism.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
