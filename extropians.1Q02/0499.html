From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20invisible%20friends%20and%20post-biological%20darwinism">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see the problem that such a device is infeasible since a lot of thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not even wrong, being based on fuzzy expectations, values and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts with little agreed-upon semantics.
</em><br>
<p>Well, since no one, not even Anders, has been able to figure it out, I guess
<br>
I'll have to explain that a device for accurately identifying incorrect
<br>
thinking has already been invented, and has been in use for hundreds of years,
<br>
although relatively few people avail themselves of its awesome power. The
<br>
device for accurately identifying incorrect thinking is the scientific method.
<br>
Yes, this method is very frightening, and many people oppose its use, and many
<br>
have resisted its implementation. That the method works is not in question,
<br>
but that so few understand how it works is the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The device would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a telepathic supersmart AI, and somehow that seems a bit of overkill.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the scientific method (which is a proven device for accurately
<br>
identifying incorrect thinking) needs to be &quot;telepathic&quot; although it may
<br>
appear to render &quot;supersmart&quot; results from time to time. Of course, science
<br>
does appear to be magic to some folks, but that does not entail supersmarts as
<br>
much as it derives from dispassionate analysis of the real world and a lot of
<br>
hard work.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
