<p>1) Why make the thought experiment more different than you need to?
<br>
Suppose, rather, that the modification resulted in your children speaking a
<br>
language which you lack the capacity for, and failing to develop full
<br>
fluency in your native language.
<br>
<p>2) If it's universally wrong to place a concern for the closeness of your
<br>
relationship with your child over some independent concern for the child's
<br>
well-being, then shouldn't you be looking for the smartest, richest, most
<br>
capable parents you could turn your infant over to?
<br>
<p>3) Look, trying to do what's best for everyone is just going to give us
<br>
more bloody ideological world wars.  The deaf community is pretty small.
<br>
If you really think that kids who don't get cochlear implants are being
<br>
damaged, I'd suggest you learn to live with it.  The majority of children
<br>
in the world, after all, are being hampered by adults in more significant
<br>
ways.
