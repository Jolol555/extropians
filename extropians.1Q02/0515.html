<p><p>It seems to me that you are completely missing the point.  Starvation, for
<br>
example, is not caused by any intrinsic lack of resources but rather is a
<br>
situation caused directly or indirectly by intent.  Simply giving food to
<br>
starving people in Africa is attempting to solve a problem that doesn't
<br>
exist (the &quot;problem&quot; being the unavailability of food).  Which isn't to say
<br>
that people aren't starving.  It is just that the starvation isn't caused by
<br>
a lack of resources; substantial effort was expended by individuals to
<br>
create the food imbalance.  Giving a little food has done nothing to solve
<br>
the problem, and in some cases, made it worse.
<br>
<p>The same story with illiteracy.  In many parts of the world, it rarely has
<br>
anything to do with teacher availability.  Adding more teachers would
<br>
contribute nothing.  As with starvation, the resources exist but aren't
<br>
being utilized for various reasons that have nothing to do with the
<br>
symptoms.
<br>
<p>As for an HIV cure, the private sector has expended astronomical amounts of
<br>
money looking for a cure, and there are dozens of biotech companies with
<br>
active HIV research programs that would have nothing to lose and many
<br>
billions of dollars to gain by coming up with an effective cure.  Your
<br>
apparent assertion on this issue is absurd.
