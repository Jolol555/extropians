<em>&gt; Let me say this one more time: all people have an equal right to marry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone of the opposite sex. There is NO discrimination in this at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gays and lesbians, transgendered and bisexuals all have the same right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to marry someone of the opposite sex that heteros do.
</em><br>
<p>You are again using the dictionary definition of a word to argue law.  Equal
<br>
rights or lack of discrimination does not mean they are treated the same.
<br>
Equal rights or lack of discrimination means everyone is equally left alone
<br>
to pursue their own life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
<br>
<p>Making everyone vote Democratic would treat everyone the same.  By the
<br>
dictionary definition, this would not be discrimination.  But legally, it
<br>
would violate the rights of Republicans and give unequal protection to
<br>
Democrats.  Likewise, the establishment of a state religion would treat
<br>
everyone the same.  Everyone would be free to participate in the same
<br>
religion.  The founding fathers clearly saw that this &quot;equal treatment&quot;
<br>
would be unfair to minority religions.  They demanded and instituted freedom
<br>
of religion for all religions, not just the majority religion.
<br>
<p>The concept of being treated &quot;the same&quot; has little bearing on legal
<br>
definitions of discrimination.  Most discriminatory laws that have been
<br>
overturned applied to everyone the same way.  This did not stop them from
<br>
having a devastating impact on one segment of the population while giving
<br>
preferred treatment to another.  You are correct when you argue the
<br>
dictionary definition of these words, but you are incorrect when you argue
<br>
the legal concepts that use these same words for specific legal concepts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I entirely support the idea of redefining marriage, but lets not play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games with claiming a pre-existing right where none exists.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, most courts have found that this is a pre-existing right assumed
<br>
in the constitution of the United States and of most individual states.
<br>
This occurs every time a state supreme court rules that gays have the right
<br>
to marry.  There is then a quick move to /amend/ the state constitution to
<br>
prohibit this right.  Legally, in such cases, the right was interpreted to
<br>
have always existed and was recently removed by congressional action in
<br>
those states.  Although you may disagree in various ways with this history,
<br>
it is the legally correct and legally binding history of many of these laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to redefine marriage, you still are going to wind up defining it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that it discriminates against the desires of some segment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keep in mind that the social mores that cause people to be disgusted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the desires of groups like NAMBLA are very similar to the ones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create homophobia and other anti-gay sentiments, and which restricted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same sex marriages throughout history. Lets not claim that there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant difference here.
</em><br>
<p>There is a big difference between consenting adults and unconsenting
<br>
children, or between co-equal partners and unequal adult and child roles.
<br>
Also, children are not legally able to give consent unless laws specifically
<br>
give them the right, whereas adults are legally able to give consent unless
<br>
laws specifically take away that right.  These two cases are polar
<br>
opposites, legally speaking.
