</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's working marvelously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Everyone assumed we would be using the weapons of the Last Big One to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prosecute the Cold War, but we didn't, not exactly. More of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a War via marketing to muster the economic clout to outlast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialism (at least in it's extreme form).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Assume that the chem-phys-psych-bio progression is essentially
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Who are the likely enemies?....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    It's 1920.. where is the Evil Axis?
</em><br>
<p>WW3 was a contest of mass mediocrity versus exceptional excellence,
<br>
stick versus carrot.
<br>
<p>WW4 is the final contest between reason and faith. As the side of
<br>
reason, we are at an automatic disadvantage in that most of us are not
<br>
so convinced of ourselves that we would be willing to do anything to
<br>
win. Those on the side of faith are so convinced of themselves. 
<br>
<p>At its core, all world wars have been over which is superior: lies
<br>
versus truth. First you had the imperialism lie versus the human liberty
<br>
truth, second you had the racism lie versus the humanism truth, thirdly
<br>
you had the socialism lie versus the free market truth, and finally you
<br>
have the lie of religion versus the truth of reason, science, and
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>Countries would not go to war against each other if one side or the
<br>
other were not lying about their point of view.
<br>
<p>In this faith versus reason war, you have various faiths: in god, in
<br>
power, in a romantic vision of some arcadian or andelusian period, a
<br>
golden age in the past. This is true whether you are talking about
<br>
fundamentalist muslims, christian fundamentalists, or fanatical
<br>
eco-terrorists and anti-tech luddites. All of these seek to impose some
<br>
great lie on the world, and to stamp out the voice of reason which
<br>
illuminates the emptiness of their lies.
<br>
<p>A weakness of the cause of reason is that we are portrayed as the
<br>
criminals against humanity, producing genetically engineered organisms
<br>
that are released to the environment, portrayed by the luddites as
<br>
bioweapons. The fact that this is a lie is of no consequence for those
<br>
prepared to believe such a lie and repeat it often. This will be a
<br>
largely propagandistic war. As such, eliminating the sources of enemy
<br>
propaganda are of paramount importance, as is countering it with truth,
<br>
exposing the lies for what they are, and convincing those who believe in
<br>
them otherwise.
<br>
<p>Infiltration is also of importance. In WW3, one of the most important
<br>
operations of the war was the placement of one of the top western
<br>
members of the ComIntern as a double agent for the FBI. Unbeknownst to
<br>
the rest of the world, the FBI was aware of the millions of dollars
<br>
funnelled to agents in the US through the US Communist Party, and their
<br>
agent even sat in on Politburo meetings in Moscow, and was held in high
<br>
esteem by the Kremlin when he predicted that Nixon would leave office
<br>
over Watergate.
<br>
<p>In WWII we had similar moles in Berlin, and most Nazi agents were caught
<br>
and turned to act as double agents, such as the famous 'Garbo' who
<br>
helped deceive Hitler about the D-Day invasion. We also had Alan
<br>
Turing's cracking of the enigma codes used by German military units.
<br>
<p>In this respect, we too should focus on placing infiltrators into
<br>
various groups of the opposition, being patient about their movement up
<br>
the chain of command and supporting their work all the way. We need to
<br>
develop quantum computation to crack the encrypted communications of the
<br>
opposition (the luddites and anti-globalists love PGP, btw) and tools to
<br>
sniff out their packet traffic on the web.
<br>
<p>The opposition is not an organized government. It is not necessary to
<br>
leave the job of combatting them to governments.
