<em>&gt; &gt; Well, yes, of course. Not that I like it, but this is an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational argument to make, because if you kept that amount of cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outside of a bank account, then you must be trying to hide it from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government for some reason. At the very least you are trying to evade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tax laws, at worst you are engaging in illicit trade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is also rational to assume that if you got that amount of cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legitimately, you should be able to demonstrate with receipt records who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you got it from and for what... at which point you'll be asked to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taxes on it...  of course, the fact that many businesses deal in far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater sums every day has no bearing... a legitimate business is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumed to keep the sort of records that would show how the money was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; earned ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, Mike,but your narrow world-view here is a bit detached from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.  I, and many other professional and semi-pro poker players
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know, routinely carry large amounts of cash into and out of casinos,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we don't get receipts for every transaction.  Many cash merchants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry large amounts as well (though they tend to have better records).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but do you report your poker winnings as income? Under the law, you
<br>
are supposed to report winnings as income.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And besides, isn't hiding income from the government a marvellous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life-affirming expression of libertarian values?
</em><br>
<p>Yes it is. I am simply following the government logic to its rational
<br>
conclusion. It does hang together. I don't like it, and I try to do my
<br>
best to pay as little in taxes as possible (hey, I'll have no income tax
<br>
to pay for 2001!). If someone can actually prove in public, and have it
<br>
hang together in court, that income taxes are not mandatory, I'm all for
<br>
it. However, for those who accept the statist mindset, you either accept
<br>
it all or suffer the consequences.
