<em>&gt; However the constant obsession with lowering

</em><br>
<p><p>The taxes are on income, not on wealth, hence why many wealthy people don't
<br>
seem to pay that much in taxes.  For example, Bill Gates only makes
<br>
something like one million dollars a year of income; punitively taxing his
<br>
income probably costs him less than his utility bill.  Most of the &quot;income&quot;
<br>
for a wealthy person is frequently derived from some type of capital
<br>
investment, which doesn't suffer from the same tax structure as working
<br>
folk.  The current punitive tax structure, and the fact that people seem to
<br>
ignore that income is not wealth, is arguably one of the biggest reasons
<br>
that more people in the middle class don't become wealthy.
<br>
<p>Income is potential wealth, not real wealth.  The current tax structure
<br>
interferes with conversion of potential wealth into real wealth.  The more
<br>
wealthy people there are, the more society benefits.  Therefore, one could
<br>
argue that the current &quot;progressive&quot; income tax structure actually serves to
<br>
limit the spreading of wealth in the population.  Taxing the life out of the
<br>
middle class every time they get a pay raise neither &quot;soaks the rich&quot; nor
<br>
helps the middle class become financially independent.  Put this way,
<br>
progressive income tax structures sound more like a way for a rich elite to
<br>
stay that way.
