<em>&gt; &gt; The general consensus seems to be that AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; won't be AI until it is sentient.  But, so long as it is capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; autonomically meeting my needs, I don't want or need it to be sentient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Personally I'd rather have an AI smart enough to do all the tasks I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to it yet dumb enough not to know its smarter than me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ya ain't never gonna get it.  What you just asked for requires general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence and self-awareness.
</em><br>
<p>I admittedly don't have your credentials in the field.  So if I were a 
<br>
betting man, I'd bet on your prognostications over my own.  But based on 
<br>
what I've seen so far, I beg to differ.
<br>
<p>Right *now* I have a computer that listens to me speak and turns my vocal 
<br>
utterances into text.  It's not perfect, but after a couple years of 
<br>
&quot;training&quot; it's better than 95%.  I also have systems that notify me by a 
<br>
gentle vibration on my wrist whenever I receive a voicemail and/or email 
<br>
message.  I can read the header and the first few words of the body of the 
<br>
email on my watch and, if I want, I can call from my cell phone and have a 
<br>
computer read the entire message to me over the phone.  I can then respond 
<br>
to the email vocally over the phone and have a .wav of my spoken reply sent 
<br>
by email.  I can also, over the phone, request that my email messages be 
<br>
forwarded to any nearby fax machine.
<br>
<p>I have and use all of the foregoing services *today* with lousy 2002 
<br>
technology.  None of the services described above requires the input or 
<br>
effort of any meat puppet other than myself.  It is all performed by very, 
<br>
very dumb computers listening and obeying my every command.
<br>
<p>Admittedly none of the above services are as impressive as, say, reviving me 
<br>
from a vitrified state or imposing world peace or eliminating the social, 
<br>
economic and geo-political problems of the world.  But then any system that 
<br>
*could* do that would be in control, and you and I would be at its complete 
<br>
mercy.
<br>
<p>Maybe that sounds good to you.  Not to me.  I am convinced that my needs can 
<br>
and will be met by dumb &quot;AI.&quot;  No doubt people will continue to improve on a 
<br>
good thing, to the point of testing the old adage that too much of a good 
<br>
thing is a bad thing.  My money says we'll find that old adage to hold true. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that unhappy day, we will be fat, dumb and happy bossing around dumb 
<br>
AI at our pleasure.  After that, don't say I didn't warn you...
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
