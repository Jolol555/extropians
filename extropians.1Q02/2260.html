</em><br>
<em>&gt; So goes the litany of evils that so many Americans seem to project upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of mild, almost disinterested, social responsibility that seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color Oz.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know what is the strangest thing? The people who foam most strongly at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mouth when screeching about the evils of society are those who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefitted most from it. Those who have been born into the richer classes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have gained their wealth and knowledge from countless generations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before them, demand that they alone be recognised as being the creators of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their good fortune and that they are damned if they will share it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody else.
</em><br>
<p>Can you prove otherwise? Government has always operated more as a
<br>
hindrance to individuals attaining wealth than a help. How, in fact, did
<br>
government give Bill Gates $60 billion? How has it given Harvey, or
<br>
Brent, or any other successful extropian their wealth. Every one of them
<br>
will demonstrate how they worked their butts off for it.
<br>
<p>While I don't deny that there are those who make a career of feeding at
<br>
the public trough, and some of the smart ones even get rich at it, but
<br>
the overwhelming majority do so just to avoid doing real work.
<br>
<p>While Forrest's litany is certainly dead on accurate, the number one
<br>
thing wrong about Oz is that its residents are not sovereign citizens,
<br>
and never have been. In the treaty of independence, it explicitly states
<br>
that the parliament is the sovereign power and that it has obtained its
<br>
sovereignty from the just delegation of the Queen of England.
<br>
<p>As such, the residents will never be more than serfs (and surfers)
<br>
living in a lotus eaters paradise (until the lotuses run out).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Thanks for the offer, sport, but I already live on or about the socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shithole of Plantation USA, picking my &quot;fair share&quot; of cotton for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;greater grandeur of Massah'. I use Karl Marx's definition of socialism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto, abolition of private property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(slaves don't own property), dissolution of the family, etc., which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fairly accurate, funtionalistic description of the contemporary US System.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sure you don't really know how lucky you are Mr Bishop. You have become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insulated from the real world. Surely you don't really think that USA is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything approaching communist. This must surely be chest-beating, soapbox
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyperbole... your favorite rant... not anything to do with the real world.
</em><br>
<p>You apparently don't know much about the US. Its actually quite a
<br>
pastiche of systems from state to state, although the last half century
<br>
has imposed a federal blanket of socialist confiscation upon everyone.
<br>
It's tax system is rigged so that you either surrender any margin that
<br>
would serve to make you wealthy, or you have to become a tax criminal to
<br>
escape wage slavery.
