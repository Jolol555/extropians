<p>
How much control should parents have over their children?
<br>
<p>Ooops, I just received Brian Williams' post with the Khalil Gibran quote,
<br>
and I feel I have almost nothing more to say.
<br>
<p>Still, let me try to elaborate a little bit on this subject.
<br>
Children are not their parents' chattels, to be molded into their parents'
<br>
ideal image. An ethically correct approach to the autonomy of children might
<br>
involve using the following test: An action is ethically superior if the
<br>
child sees it as such once he/she becomes an adult. In other words, the
<br>
child's hypothetical hindsight should guide our actions, as long as we do
<br>
not undertake direct neural manipulations of the goal-seeking mechanisms in
<br>
the child's mind (in that case other issues become important).
<br>
<p>Since we do not have the ability to predict any particular subject's future
<br>
attitudes, we have to use statistical data. Whatever the majority of humans
<br>
would see as beneficial if applied to them when they imagine themselves in
<br>
the child's place, is the practical standard for action. This standard might
<br>
need to be modified to take into consideration the effects of differential
<br>
cognitive abilities.
<br>
<p>I would venture that the majority of humans would consider having adequate
<br>
hearing as desirable, clearly better than the alternative. Therefore, such
<br>
implants should be placed as a matter of policy. While refusal to have a
<br>
cochlear implant placed in their child might not be enough to merit the
<br>
charge of child abuse and legal action, the parents should be made aware
<br>
that the child might have the right to bring charges against them at
<br>
maturity, and that they will be liable for any financial losses suffered by
<br>
the child, or by the state on behalf of the child (remedial education,
<br>
possibly unemployment benefits).
<br>
<p>BTW, as for the risk of IQ-enhanced children becoming socialists, I doubt it
<br>
- I remember being a socialist at age 10. In the decades since then my IQ
<br>
declined only minimally, yet I am about as far from being a socialist as you
<br>
can be and still remain a decent person. AFAIK, high IQ is somewhat
<br>
correlated with the absence of certain attitudes, e.g. fascism,
<br>
authoritarianism, extreme selfishness, but socialism, at least in the
<br>
classical sense, is not prevalent among smart people anymore.
