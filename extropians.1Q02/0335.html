<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) Do different countries have the EXACT same bills and coins in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail? No, they don't. As several europeans here have said, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very slight but noticable differences on the paper bills and the reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side of every coin has  graphics particular to the country in which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is stamped.
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly. The coins vary from one country to another (at least as regards
<br>
the reverse of the coins) but the notes are uniform throughout the eurozone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) Therefore, there are 12 different national mints involved in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production of the new european currency, and the 12 different central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banks who run those mints.
</em><br>
<p>Not so. National central banks are effectively redundant. It's the ECB which
<br>
directs the national mints and controls the money supply for the whole of
<br>
the eurozone - that's precisely the problem
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All it takes is for one of those mints to decide to over or under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce their local currency to entirely mess up the money supply for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.
</em><br>
<p>They are no longer able to do this - see above. That is why the member
<br>
states of the eurozone have agreed to strict limits on government borrowing,
<br>
because they can no longer manipulate the money supply or the exchange rate
<br>
to get around the problems excessive spending would cause. Will they be able
<br>
to stick to this? I doubt it (it already looks as though Germany is going to
<br>
hit the limit in the first half of this year).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All that has really occured is that all 12 countries have changed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name of their currency to the 'Euro' and have agreed to tie the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each to that of all other 'Euros', much as many countries in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tie their own currency one for one to the US Dollar. The heads of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national Central Bank belong to the European Central Bank, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean that each national bank will actually honestly deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone else.
</em><br>
<p>This is an accurate description of how things were until Jan 1st. They are
<br>
now trying to make it work as a genuine single currency, part of which
<br>
involves taking all discretion away from national central banks and giving
<br>
it all to the ECB plus a single interest rate etc. Whether they will succeed
<br>
is quite another matter. I agree that the euro will probably not challenge
<br>
the dollar as a reserve currency because its record as a store of value is
<br>
worse than the dollar during the short time it's been in existence and the
<br>
governments of the eurozone are unwilling/unable to make the reforms that
<br>
would get the eurozone economy growing. A few years ago I heard Bill
<br>
Niskanen give a talk on the euro and he made several predictions (e.g. that
<br>
it would decline against the dollar and other currencies, that it would have
<br>
a relatively high rate of inflation, that its effect on Germany would be
<br>
deflationary) all of which have so far proved correct, except for the last
<br>
one ie that the euro would not lat for more than five years. His argument
<br>
was that sooner or later there would be an exogenous shock with very
<br>
differential effects (a war in the Middle East perhaps?) and in consequence
<br>
the eurozone governments would be faced with a choice: abandon the euro by
<br>
retaking control of domestic money supply (as Mike Lorrey says) or make big
<br>
changes in the welfare state and labour market. He predicted they would do
<br>
the former. Personally, I favour a single currency but not a central bank
<br>
(these are a disaster IMO). BTW - the first forged euronotes appeared on 3rd
<br>
January. Isn't the ingenuity of the criminal fraternity amazing? Steve
