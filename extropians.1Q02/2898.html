<em>&gt; But did imperialism survive WWI? Not really, and Wilson's lobbying and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced enough people that imperialism was a dumb idea, and the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the US was needed to end the war helped put the nails in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coffin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wilson began the movement for internation recognition of human rights as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something beyond the ability or right of governments to oppress. That it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took till the end of WWII for this to come to fruition is only proof of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the maxim that who wins wars is really only decided by the next war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Imperialism, as an ideology, did survive the Great War. Moreover, one can
<br>
argue that its ideological underpinnings were strengthened by the downfall
<br>
of the Dual Monarchy, Germany, Russia and the Ottomans. Countries during the
<br>
interwar period who wished to overturn the Versailles treaty settlement
<br>
viewed the expansion of their power in territorial and inperialistic terms:
<br>
German lebensraum, Italy in Abyssinia, Japan and Manchukuo. Their
<br>
governmental ideologies incorporated the dynamic of imperialism and married
<br>
it to new racial and national extremes.
<br>
<p>The British and French empires remained in existence at this time, and
<br>
remained symbols of national strength for their electorates.
<br>
Anti-imperialistic arguments in Europe were mainly derived from
<br>
Marxist-Leninist theory and never gained much credence beyond the Left.
<br>
<p>Imperialism in Britain eventually lost its ideological grip with the
<br>
Atlantic Charter.
<br>
<p>Perhaps imperialism did lose its ideological hold upon the US under Wilson
<br>
but the Versailles Treaty and its principle of self-determination had to
<br>
battle with the long-standing notions of racial and cultural superiority
<br>
that justified empire.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Countries would not go to war against each other if one side or the

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; other were not lying about their point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you wish to view a war in terms of the ideologies expressed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; participants, how do you distinguish between their ideas and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the propaganda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; created in support of their point of view? Propaganda is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural tool of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any nation at war and all sides lie about their intentions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At least, any country at war has done this so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Propaganda, per se, is not always a lie. There are two forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propaganda: information and disinformation. One is truth, the other is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsehood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Propaganda is always a form of untruth as the authors wish the reader or
<br>
observer to privelege a particular interpretation. The author is hoping that
<br>
their work is structured in such a way that it will make your mind up for
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>Studies of British propaganda during WWII found that it was not possible to
<br>
modify deeply held attitudes but that you could reinforce and exacerbate
<br>
preexisting attitudes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In this faith versus reason war, you have various faiths: in god, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; power, in a romantic vision of some arcadian or andelusian period, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; golden age in the past. snip...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you wish to view history through this construct of faith
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (and it is not an interpretation that appears to have a great deal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explanatory force), then surely you should note that one of the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vehicles of faith since 1789 has been nationalism. Faith in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's nation has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been the motive for evil atrocities up to and including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genocide. Would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; add the nationalist to your list?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. However, nationalism being wrong and false does not mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything it involves is automatically false (just as a KKK member can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still tell the truth when he says the sky is blue). Objectively ranking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one form of polity as objectively better than another is significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from having blind faith in one's nation, right or wrong.
</em><br>
<p>The terms 'false' and 'wrong' are only applicable if you wish to view
<br>
history as a conflict between rationalism and irrationalism (which would
<br>
include your definition of faith). However, it is not possible for a
<br>
nationalist to set down objective criteria in order to assess nations, as
<br>
s/he develops an exaggerated sense of belonging to their own nation through
<br>
sentiment and/or loyalty. This is not a statement saying that the objective
<br>
ranking of polities is impossible but that one has to reflect on these views
<br>
and discount them before attempting suvh an assessment.
