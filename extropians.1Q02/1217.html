</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If same sex marriages are ever made legal, I doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd have to prove your homosexual orientation to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a marriage license anymore than you now have to prove
</em><br>

<em>&gt; have the same &quot;right&quot; to marry same sex partners that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homosexuals now &quot;enjoy&quot; to marry opposite sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must be making a point I am completely missing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, lets take, for example, a scenario where an employed woman is in a
<br>
healthy and public hetero relationship with a man in town, and has a
<br>
widowed mother with a significant health problem that needs the support
<br>
of insurance benefits that she is not able to afford herself. The
<br>
employed woman decides, under the hypothetical 'marry anybody' law, to
<br>
marry her mother in order to obtain the desired benefits for her. Since
<br>
the town clerk knows the woman is in a hetero relationship with a person
<br>
other than her mother, the application for marriage license is denied.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conferring this right on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; heteros still discriminates against sibling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parent/child,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aunt/uncle/neice/nephew/cousin couples, whereupon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you wind up legalizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the sort of garbage that NAMBLA promulgates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never did like &quot;slippery slope&quot; arguments too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much... and this one seems worse than most.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Incest and statutory rape are two completely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, yet you seem to be equating them.
</em><br>
<p>The point is that no matter what you think, the state DOES, in fact,
<br>
regulate what human relationships are legal and illegal, and therefore
<br>
it DOES, in fact, discriminate and violate the equal protection rights
<br>
of SOME portion of the population regarding marriage laws, so,
<br>
therefore, the use of the equal protection clause to justify gay
<br>
marriage (which is the only legal argument used) is entirely unjustified
<br>
and hypocritical so long as gay marriage proponents support laws against
<br>
these other sorts of relationships.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, isn't heterosexual statutory rape allowed in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states as long as the parents of the minor involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give their consent to the marriage?
</em><br>
<p>It's only statutory rape if someone claims a statute is violated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just googled &quot;marriage age&quot;.  According to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/Table_Marriage.htm">http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/Table_Marriage.htm</a>,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Vermont the statutory rape of sixteen year old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girls is perfectly legal... as long as the parents of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the girl give their permission and the male and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victim go through the meaningless rituals proscribed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by religious and/or secular authorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's even worse in Kansas... 12 year old girls are up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for grabs.
</em><br>
<p>You forget that if it is legal, then it's not statutory rape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damn those queers at NAMBLA for wanting the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights with regards to the age of their sex partners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that heterosexual men enjoy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When it comes to marriage, it needs to be recognised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is very much a discriminatory institution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it a discriminatory institution and even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importantly why does that need to be recognized?
</em><br>
<p>It is dicriminatory in that so long as ALL possible human relationships
<br>
are not legalized under marriage statutes, marriage statutes DO, in
<br>
fact, discriminate against some percentage of the population. You can
<br>
deny it, but that doesn't change the facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and discriminatory for a signficant purpose,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What purpose?  If you are talking about the conception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of children (anything else makes no sense at all) then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this (exi list) seems an odd place to put forth this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument.  We routinely discuss technologies that make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a traditional heterosexual marriage superfluous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception.
</em><br>
<p>Of course. But such technologies do not currently exist, and the
<br>
standard in law is that you don't change a technology dependent law
<br>
until the technology has, in fact, changed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so use of 'equal protection' arguments by lgbt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; couples/advocates is simply hypocritical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;hypocritical&quot;? Even assuming some basis for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary assumption, I don't see that this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion follows.
</em><br>
<p>Claiming a right to marry same sex partners, under the equal protection
<br>
doctrine, while denying the right for any other person to marry anyone
<br>
they want for any reason they want (including those proposed by NAMBLA),
<br>
is hypocritical. At least be honest about it.

<em>&gt; P.S.  I read in the Mike Mailway column yesterday &lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/mailway/article.asp?id=54180">http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/mailway/article.asp?id=54180</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is against the law to paint your house in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vermont.  Is that true?
</em><br>
<p>Don't know about that. I do know that it is illegal in SOME Vermont
<br>
towns to paint your house a different color without the approval of the
<br>
planning/zoning/conservation boards (pick one). This is primarily to
<br>
reduce the incidence of goofballs painting their homes with freaky
<br>
colors like purple or fluorescent orange, colors that would likely
<br>
detract from the value of neighboring homes. For example, I know of one
<br>
lesbian woman who moved in from New York City, bought a really
<br>
attractive home in downtown Thetford and proceeded to have it painted
<br>
lesbian violet (with a few prominently placed 'delta' insignias) as a
<br>
statement of her status. She is currently in a protracted legal battle
<br>
with the town government and her neighbors over this.
