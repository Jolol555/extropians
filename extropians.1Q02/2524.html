RE: Bye-Bye to the &gt;H Right WingFrom: Smigrodzki, Rafal 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;### Gee, I hated school with a vengeance - as in having to sit bored out of my mind after reading the handbook (if boredom didn't stop me from that as well), while the class was still going through the first chapters. Or memorizing dates of battles (1410, the battle of Grunwald, 1648 the Cossack uprisings... no google needed to recall these useless facts).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, there was some boredom, especially in the elementary classes.     I found American schools much &quot;slower&quot; than Portuguese and Russian schools, the latter two which preceded my experience with formal education.  But that was eons ago - methods of teaching have changed so much (due to technology) that my experiences could only be considered antediluvian.  I think even my kids' experiences may be considered somewhat old - they came of age in the 1980s, when cell phones weren't ubiquitous in school hallways yet!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago I read about plans for self-directed learning in schools where, with the help of computers, students would be able to learn at their own pace.  Is this being implemented?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love to have had the technology available to schools now ... when I went to school. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;O.
