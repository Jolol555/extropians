<p>
Bad apples. Bah.
<br>
<p>So someone cracked the hosting provider (www.readyhosting.com) for the
<br>
Longevity Meme (www.longevitymeme.org) getting on for 17 days ago. Wiped out
<br>
a bunch of database servers, web servers, the backups, etc. Bad time for me,
<br>
because I was ramping up for the crucial 3gsm show at Cannes and could spare
<br>
neither the time nor the money to shift web hosts and rebuild everything.
<br>
<p>Readyhosting was, in classic kneejerk fashion, incommunicado about the whole
<br>
affair for twelve days; not responding to calls, shutting down their tech
<br>
support system, the complete tortoise act.
<br>
<p>I'm finally up again, and looking at recreating from scratch; teach me not
<br>
to have found the time to backup the database offsite rather than rely on
<br>
their daily backups. At least I have the kindly contributed articles sitting
<br>
in final ascii format on my hard drive, and all the web pages, database
<br>
notes, etc, all intact.
<br>
<p>So I get to share my annoyance at least. Since this is the extropy list, I
<br>
should make it kinda relevant to the future &amp; tie in with a popular topic
<br>
these days; how does one deal with the malignant stupidity of the few? In a
<br>
sufficiently large population, you're always going to have grief players in
<br>
the game of life -- those who gain satisfaction and reward from causing
<br>
other people harm and distress. As the tech moves forward, these grief
<br>
players -- just like every other small group -- are going to wield ever
<br>
greater power. It also seems that their ability to go unpunished, even
<br>
undetected, is getting better too, although that may be just a phase due to
<br>
a particular alignment of technologies.
<br>
<p>So what to do? It has to have been, oh at least a week, since we talked
<br>
about transparency of society, ethics of control, the human condition and
<br>
the problem of increasing power in the hands of the bad apples. Feel free to
<br>
pontificate...
