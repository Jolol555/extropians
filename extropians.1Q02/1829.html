<p>true true.... although the only really not good application i can think of for an artificial 
<br>
womb is some madman trying to breed an army, which has already been established as 
<br>
fairly ludicrous.
<br>
honestly, i'm rather divided on them. i think overall it's a good technology. but i remember 
<br>
when i was very much in a girl headspace, the one thing that caused me the most grief 
<br>
was that i would never be able to *bear* children. i could adopt, or get a surrogate 
<br>
mother, or now use an artificial womb - but i had (and still do, very rarely) an urge to go 
<br>
through the whole process in it's &quot;natural&quot; state.
<br>
but since we wouldn't be forcing anyone to use these, that's a moot point (and if i could 
<br>
bear children, i probably would); and the potential for letting couples who otherwise 
<br>
couldn't have children have them is simply wonderful.
<br>
<p>and now for something completely different: anders, it was your page that introduced me 
<br>
to transhumanism. i cannot thank you enough.
