<em>&gt; I'll make a very harsh (and probably get crucified for it)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion.  Children are parasites on their parents for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least the first 9 months, if not the their first 18 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course parents are free to choose creating those parasites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but they are operating under the influence of a genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program designed to bias their decisions.  Given the investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that parents make in children, it is perfectly reasonable that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they should select those most likely to generate the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ROI from the parents' perspective.  In this respect one should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be selecting children not for sex or intelligence or eye color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but those most likely to remain loyal to the parent and repay the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support that the parents have provided over the developmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not interested in crucifying anyone; we should at least consider
<br>
challenging ideas.
<br>
<p>However I don't think this idea is all that practical, and more
<br>
importantly I don't think it is Extropian.
<br>
<p>For practicality, there are several problems.  It is questionable whether
<br>
in Western society kids can ever repay what the parents put into them.
<br>
With government-provided retirement benefits and health care it is no
<br>
longer necessary for kids to support their parents in their old age,
<br>
which was always one of the main paybacks.  Also, with small families
<br>
of one to two children it is hard for kids to be much help around the
<br>
home or with odd jobs.
<br>
<p>Also it is questionable whether there is a loyalty gene and if so whether
<br>
it would work reliably to the parents' advantage.  Eliezer some time
<br>
back recommended the book &quot;The Nurture Assumption,&quot; which argues that
<br>
in today's society, kids are influenced more by their peers than their
<br>
families.  A child with a loyalty gene might turn into a follower who
<br>
ends up in a cult, taking the parents' investment with him.
<br>
<p>As for the anti-Extropianism of giving birth to a conscious entity
<br>
with the intention of making him into a little slave who never frees
<br>
himself from his mother's apron strings, I hope that speaks for itself.
<br>
Extropianism is a philosophy which celebrates diversity and growth.
<br>
Intentionally limiting the capabilities for growth of a child is as
<br>
antithetical to Extropian philosophy as can be imagined.
