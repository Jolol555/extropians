</em><br>
<p>Maybe I should rephrase my statement here... in terms of the process of
<br>
transformation, of which humans and dogs are both part, in the past through
<br>
natural selection, and in the future probably including more direct
<br>
intervention, the dog is not so far from us after all. Evolutionarily, how
<br>
far from dumb dog to sentient dog? Does that make an ethical difference to
<br>
an SI? Should it make a difference to us?
