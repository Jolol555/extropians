<p>
It seems to me that Eric and Eliezer both fail to realize that the
<br>
purpose of something is nowhere to be discovered, whether by normal or
<br>
super-intelligence.
<br>
<p>Purpose, like value, is something you assign to something, not a fact
<br>
of nature.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, you may consider an artefact and try to find the
<br>
purpose its maker had in mind ; and if considering living things,
<br>
including yourself, you may do the same with evolution. But this -- as
<br>
Eliezer recognizes -- doesn't answer THAT question ; no more than the
<br>
value given to something by someone else (or by the market) tells you
<br>
the value it has for you (unless you plan to sell it of course).
<br>
<p>In the end, you are just what you are, and though you may feel it
<br>
isn't much, it is the sole basis for any such judgement you may make.
<br>
<p>Don't see it as a limitation : it is actually the only basis FOR ANY
<br>
VALUE AND PURPOSE TO EXIST IN THE WORLD. So accept it.
<br>
<p>Saying all your inherited goals are &quot;arbitrary&quot; only shows you can
<br>
somehow step outside of yourself through conceptual thought, for best
<br>
and worse ; but it is not the path to non-arbitrary ones, for there
<br>
can be only &quot;arbitrary&quot; ones in that sense of &quot;arbitrary&quot;.
<br>
<p>When we start changing ourselves, and reorganizing our goals based on
<br>
our present goals (for every rational action, including changing your
<br>
goals, follows your present goals), we may get rid of things that we
<br>
experience as desires but don't value as goals, and our goals may
<br>
evolve as we experience more situations and keep evolving. (It is an
<br>
interesting thing to imagine.) But if we stay autonomous individuals
<br>
rationnally controling their actions, it won't change the situation
<br>
conceptually.
