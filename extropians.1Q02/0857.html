<p>You're forgetting Survival Research Laboratories, Spike.
<br>
They've been putting on shows of robot twisted metal, chainsaws
<br>
and jets of flame for more than 10 years. They usually have
<br>
trouble finding US venues for their U.S. performances, however,
<br>
so they perform more outside of the U.S.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From their Web page: (.... Makes you want to be there, doesn't it?)
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Great free entertainment for an outdoor party.&quot;

SRL in Berkeley?
<br>
<p>Yes its true, SRL performed its most concentrated show ever
<br>
on Dec 15th 2001. Packed into the lot at 1010 Murray St.,
<br>
presided over by Jim Mason and known as &quot;The Shipyard&quot; was
<br>
an infernal collection of machines ranging from the newest /
<br>
loudest, (Hovercraft), to the most dangerous, (The remote
<br>
controlled Pitching machine). Also included was the latest
<br>
PeopleHater Ape fighting technology, as well as some old
<br>
favorites like the Inchworm and 2 moldy Sneaky Soldiers,
<br>
upgraded just for this event!! Sum it all up and we had one
<br>
exciting 35-minute crash and burn. See Pics, Video coming
<br>
soon!!
<br>
<p>For the 500 people who made it from word of mouth
<br>
information alone congrats on squeezing into one of our best
<br>
events ever. For all those who did not hear about the show
<br>
we regret that this event could not be made public. There
<br>
was room for only 500 audience and the prospect of several
<br>
thousand people milling about on a Berkeley sidestreet would
<br>
have risked police intervention and another cancellation (
<br>
as occurred at Ace Junkyard earlier this year). For those of
<br>
you who are of a proactive bent and are interested in
<br>
viewing an SRL show in this area, I suggest writing a letter
<br>
to both Tania Bauer at the San Francisco Fire Dept Fire
<br>
Commission (<a href="mailto:tania_bauer@ci.sf.ca?Subject=Re:%20ROBOT:%20&quot;Robot%20Wars&quot;%20Continues%20To%20Burgeon">tania_bauer@ci.sf.ca</a>). and to Willie Brown's
<br>
office (<a href="mailto:damayor@ci.sf.ca.us?Subject=Re:%20ROBOT:%20&quot;Robot%20Wars&quot;%20Continues%20To%20Burgeon">damayor@ci.sf.ca.us</a>). Ask the SFFD to lay off the
<br>
harsh and unreasonable limits imposed on SRL shows in this
<br>
area.
<br>
<p>We are looking for individuals with property in a remote
<br>
area within 70 miles of the SF bay Area to set up an
<br>
extended test of the Flame Hurricane. Great free
<br>
entertainment for an outdoor party.
<br>
<p>SRL is now looking for alternate show venues in the
<br>
continental US. Interested parties should bear in mind that
<br>
SRL events are currently offered for free. All funding,
<br>
including costs related to securing permits will be paid up
<br>
front by SRL. We only need a location and possibly permits.
<br>
Parties who secure needed permits and locations will be paid
<br>
handsomely for their services. Please see show requirements
<br>
page for suggested specifications regarding physical sites.
<br>
Please contact Mark Pauline at markp at srl dot org
<br>
regarding show locations.
<br>
<p>SRL is the now offering the Tokyo Performance Video for
<br>
sale. Ordering info here...
<br>
<p>==========================================================
<br>
Now you can host a full scale SRL event in your area for
<br>
FREE. Yes, due to the increasing difficulty of securing
<br>
sites for SRL events due to pre-show intervention by Fire
<br>
Inspectors, we are now offering full scale SRL events for
<br>
FREE. All funding will be secured through SRL internal
<br>
channels. All a local promoter has to do is secure a
<br>
suitable location and acquire permits that will assure that
<br>
the fire and Police departments will not ruin the fun. After
<br>
that, SRL will show up and raise holy hell in your town. SRL
<br>
will need 8 weeks of pre-show prep time once a site and
<br>
permits are secured. Two weeks on-site time prior to event.
<br>
Offer good in continental US only. Interested parties should
<br>
email SRL Director Mark Pauline at mark @ srl dot org for
<br>
further information
