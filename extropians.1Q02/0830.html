<p>&lt;&lt;...An unexpectedly large number of blue stars have been found within 20 
<br>
degrees of the galactic plane, say Newberg and Yanny. These stars could be 
<br>
part of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, or a disk-like distribution of stars that 
<br>
is puffier than accepted models of stellar disks in the galaxy, and flatter 
<br>
than the spherical distribution in the halo. “The clumpiness of the stellar 
<br>
distribution in the Milky Way halo suggests that our galactic model needs to 
<br>
be reconsidered,” says Newberg. “Although we originally set out to measure 
<br>
properties of a smooth halo, we now find it difficult to determine which, if 
<br>
any, of the structures of the halo belong to that population.” “Stars in the 
<br>
halo appear to be grouped into distinct streams in the sky,” says Yanny. “A 
<br>
careful look at the stellar properties shows that they come from yet 
<br>
unidentified parent populations, perhaps other dwarf galaxies which have long 
<br>
since been torn apart.” Newberg and Yanny are the principal authors, along 
<br>
with 17 SDSS researchers, of a paper to be published by The Astrophysical 
<br>
Journal. Newberg says the findings are significant because they have an 
<br>
impact on several active fields of astronomical research, including: galactic 
<br>
structure, evolution of the Milky Way, the distribution of mass in the 
<br>
galaxy, and galaxy formation in the early Universe...&gt;
