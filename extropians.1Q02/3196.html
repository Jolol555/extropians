<DIV>&gt;Artworks, carvings etc sold by 19th </DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;century Maoris are being returned, but surely </DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;once something is sold the artist (or his descendants) has no further right 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to it? Opinions please?

<DIV>Personally, I don't like the whole idea of selling artwork (which is probably why I was never very successful as an artist). I think the true value of art is in its accessability - both physically &amp; subjectively. Visual art has a wider audience than literature for example, which can only be directly enjoyed by people who&nbsp;1) have the ability to read &amp; 2) have some level of reading comprehension.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>(**I am&nbsp;NOT saying that one is superior to the others in any way, simply that visual &amp; some performing arts require, at the most basic level,&nbsp;less of their audiences. Just to be clear, all I mean is that you can go to an opera &amp; enjoy the show without understanding the words or the story -&nbsp;the abilities to simply watch &amp; listen&nbsp;are not inhibited by any lack of comprehension. But with literature, if you can't read or comprehend the written word, you can be neither actively nor passively involved *directly* with the artform. ** Having said that...)</DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>What I mean by the "physical" accessability of art is simply this: the more people it can reach, the higher its value. Everyone brings their own unique view to a work of art. No one can say that one person's view is right or wrong - art is one of the few things that most people (barring critics) accept as a universally subjective phenomenon. I think its&nbsp;amazing how&nbsp;masses of people over&nbsp;thousands of years&nbsp;can collectively share &amp; recognize the value of a piece&nbsp;without losing that distinctly personal, individual experience that truly is the joy of art.&nbsp;What good is a piece of art if no one can see it to enjoy it? For this reason, I think art should be free to all. Sorry for grandstanding a bit, but I hope it can help&nbsp;illustrate some of the problems with the whole idea of "ownership"&nbsp;in art. (bet you couldn't guess I'm an art-lover :P) </DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>I realize this&nbsp;is even beyond idealism, so I'll get back to the point. Back in the real world, art is no different from any other commodity - once its sold, its sold for good (unless an agreement can be reached by *both sides). Its really that simple - why should any special or different rules apply?</DIV>
