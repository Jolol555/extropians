<p>
Somewhere in an alternate universe, there is a version of Eliezer Yudkowsky
<br>
who publishes &quot;leisurely&quot; scientific papers, and one of those papers is
<br>
entitled &quot;Special difficulties consequent to research on generally intelligent
<br>
supersystems.&quot;  I'll probably never get to write that paper.  But I'd like to
<br>
publish a small excerpt from that alternate universe.
<br>
<p>Right now I'm trying to use standard words, without neologism, and yet this
<br>
involves a new problem:  I'm rapidly running out of words.  If you discuss
<br>
generally intelligent supersystems, then not only will you need to overload an
<br>
immense number of words, but furthermore they will be very abstract words,
<br>
ones that would otherwise play a strong supporting role in abstract language. 
<br>
In my paper, I can no longer say &quot;the past concept that children have no
<br>
mathematical abilities&quot;; I have to say &quot;the past notion that children have no
<br>
mathematical abilities&quot;.  &quot;Concept&quot; has already been overloaded as a technical
<br>
term.  I have to use &quot;notion&quot; or &quot;idea&quot;.
<br>
<p>Recently I wanted to discuss the second part of a trigger - you know, the
<br>
thing that happens after the condition part is satisfied - and I found that I
<br>
couldn't.  &quot;Action&quot; was long since overloaded to describe a deliberate action
<br>
of the AI.  &quot;Sequitur&quot;, which would have been appropriate in this case, had
<br>
been used somewhere more important.  I'd used up the space of causal
<br>
terminology and the only words left didn't really describe what I wanted to
<br>
say - &quot;consequence&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; and &quot;outcome&quot;, for example, treat the action
<br>
(sigh) as static, rather than as an active force.  And at that I was lucky the
<br>
paper didn't go into causality in more detail, or I would probably have been
<br>
forced to use up &quot;consequence&quot;, &quot;effect&quot;, and &quot;outcome&quot; as well.  At one
<br>
point, faced with the prospect of being forced to overload the term &quot;problem&quot;
<br>
to describe a virtual-environment challenge presented by the programmer to
<br>
teach a concept or belief, I took the coward's way out.  I called it a
<br>
&quot;microenvironmental challenge&quot;, abbreviating it as &quot;MEC&quot;.
<br>
<p>So you can avoid neologism, but it's going to come at a cost; describing
<br>
thought processes abstractly often consumes a term that we use in ordinary
<br>
abstract thinking.  Maybe when I'm done with the first draft, I'll be able to
<br>
go back and reparse the language space more precisely and get rid of some of
<br>
the current problems.  For example, on reflection (and some
<br>
thesaurus-hunting), I think that &quot;microtask&quot; may do to replace the neologistic
<br>
&quot;MEC&quot;.  But don't be too quick to blame the creators of neologisms until
<br>
you've walked a few miles in their thesauruses.
