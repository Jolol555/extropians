<p>
More from the nonexistent paper, &quot;Special difficulties consequent to research
<br>
on generally intelligent supersystems&quot;:
<br>
<p>I'm not sure you could legitimately call anyone working in AI a &quot;crank&quot;.  Take
<br>
Alan Grimes.  I am willing to argue that he is an idiot and that his theory of
<br>
AI, insofar as it can be deciphered, is junk.  I'm not sure that I could get
<br>
away with calling him an &quot;AI crank&quot; or an &quot;AI crackpot&quot;, because right now the
<br>
state of the field is such that those researchers who think they have general
<br>
theories of intelligence are all arguing with each other, and those who don't
<br>
think so are bemoaning the fact that the field has still failed to yield any
<br>
general theory of intelligence.  If someone's crackpot theory fails to be
<br>
readily shot down by established theory, due to lack of same, is it really a
<br>
crackpot theory?  A stupid theory, yes, a wrong theory, yes, but crackpot?
<br>
<p>Physics crackpots generally have theories that manage to contradict
<br>
established experiments and well-confirmed theories.  In AI you may be able to
<br>
say that a theory is dumbfoundingly oversimplified and that it amounts to
<br>
recycled classical AI from the 50s and 60s, because this is what amateurs
<br>
automatically come up when they try to think about AI, but you don't have the
<br>
scientific base to call it crackpot.  People with doctorates are also still
<br>
recycling 60s-era classical AI.  I happen to think that Christopher
<br>
McKinstry's GAC is probably the worst AI theory in human history, and yet as
<br>
far as the almost-nonexistent body of established theory is concerned, a
<br>
sufficiently large database of yes-or-no questions might indeed cough up
<br>
general intelligence - who knows?  The only person who I would really feel
<br>
confident in calling an AI crackpot is Mentifex.
