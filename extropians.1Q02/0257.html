</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why, exactly are you getting in battling mode when I ask you for
<br>
clarification?  It is unnecessary.  If you are talking about
<br>
mass-energy then I see that almost everything else could
<br>
potentially be part of a commons.  Would you agree with that and
<br>
see it as a good thing at least in part?  Where would you draw
<br>
your lines of what works best as a commons and what doesn't?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yep, I'm one of those.  Owned things get put to effective use;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; things in the commons are inevitably destroyed and neglected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Doesn't it bother you that it is literally impossible to impose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ownership on every erg of energy?  Do you not understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; values of commons to innovation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two different questions: for one, I reject your childish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we-can't-be-perfect-so-let's-not-try-at-all argument. Ownership
</em><br>
<p>Why are you calling my questions &quot;childish&quot; now?  I didn't say a
<br>
darn thing about &quot;perfection&quot;.  I do point out that the idea of
<br>
imposing ownership on every quanta seems pretty impossible and
<br>
therefore silly on the face of it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of things works well, today, as it has for centuries, and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it likely will in the future.  As for the second question, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize the value of the public domain of ideas for innovation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is why I oppose intellectual property.  But no, I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any way recognize that the concept of shared ownership of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital goods is beneficial in any way to humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As things become less scarce (mass-energy is not much of a
<br>
scarcity for some time) it seems to me that ownership as such
<br>
will become less of an issue for as many things as it is today. 
<br>
That is what I would like to explore anyway.
<br>
<p>I am glad to see we have a good level of agreement re
<br>
intellectual property.  When you first said you believe in
<br>
ownership for most everything I took it rather literally.  I am
<br>
glad to see that is not how it was meant.  
<br>
<p>I don't think there will be very many &quot;capital goods&quot; a bit
<br>
after MNT myself and I don't see offhand why some shared
<br>
ownership of one's that do exist (within reason) is necessarily
<br>
ruled out of consideration.
