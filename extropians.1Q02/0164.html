<p>SEEING MORE THAN MEETS EYE
<br>
<p>Science Finding Hallucinations May Be Reflection Of Brain Pathways
<br>
<p>Near-death experiences, in which people believe they see the bright
<br>
light of heaven at the end of a tunnel, may be nothing more than the
<br>
brain cells that process vision lighting up in such a way so as to
<br>
reveal the circular pattern of how they are wired together.
<br>
<p>New research also indicates that prehistoric cave and rock art
<br>
depicting spirals, zigzags and other geometric forms may have been
<br>
done by artists experiencing the same kind of drug-induced
<br>
hallucinations that people today have when they take LSD, mescaline,
<br>
Ecstasy and other psychedelic compounds.
<br>
<p>A visual hallucination is defined as seeing something that's not
<br>
there. They are relatively common, and almost all cultures from
<br>
prehistoric times on have used drugs to induce hallucinations for
<br>
religious, healing and artistic purposes.
<br>
<p>But science now suggests that near-death images and other
<br>
hallucinations involving geometric patterns are really there-- on the
<br>
inside of the brain.
<br>
<p>Inducing Creative Mood
<br>
<p>People like Arthur Conan Doyle, Aldous Huxley, Cary Grant, Allen
<br>
Ginsberg, Tallulah Bankhead, the Beatles, Charles Dickens, Timothy
<br>
Leary and Salvador Dali, who used hallucinogens in the hopes of
<br>
inducing a creative mood, were actually lighting up their brain wiring.
<br>
<p>&quot;[It] surged upon me an uninterrupted stream of fantastic
<br>
[kaleidoscopic-like] images of extraordinary plasticity and
<br>
vividness,&quot; is how Albert Hoffman, the brilliant Swiss chemist,
<br>
described his first experience with LSD, a compound he had synthesized
<br>
in 1938.
<br>
<p>Hallucinations can also be caused by anesthetics, fatigue, hunger,
<br>
stress, alcohol, fever, adverse drug reactions, sleep deprivation,
<br>
bright flickering lights and even pressure on the eyeballs.
<br>
<p>Normally, the 100 million neurons of the credit-card size visual
<br>
cortex at the back of the head convert what our eyes see into edges
<br>
color, depth and other features, and then reassemble the pieces into
<br>
recognizable scenes of the outside world.
<br>
<p>The process works fast. About 40 milliseconds after seeing an object,
<br>
edge detectors are activated and in another 40 milliseconds the edges
<br>
become pieced together into contours and the beginnings of surfaces.
<br>
This information goes to other parts of the brain to be compared with
<br>
stored memories.
<br>
<p>In far less than a second you've basically solved the problem of
<br>
vision, of remembering, recognizing and sorting out what the object
<br>
is.
<br>
<p>In the case of a hallucination, this does not happen. Through the
<br>
action of drugs or other influences, the edge detectors become
<br>
disengaged from the rest of the network and begin firing on their own.
<br>
<p>The resulting hallucination reflects the pinwheel pattern of brain
<br>
cells that process lines, curves and other geometric shapes, providing
<br>
a remarkable view of the physical architecture of the visual cortex,
<br>
according to recently published findings by Jack Cowan of the
<br>
University of Chicago and Paul Bressloff of the University of Utah.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's almost like seeing your own brain through a mirror,&quot; Cowan said.
<br>
&quot;You're basically seeing patterns that your own brain is making.&quot;
<br>
<p>4 Basic Groups
<br>
<p>Cowan, who is a mathematician and a neurologist, has been studying
<br>
hallucinations for 20 years. He was intrigued by the work of another
<br>
U. of C. scientist, Heinrich Kluver, who in the 1920s and 1930s
<br>
classified the drawings of people experiencing drug-induced
<br>
hallucinations into four basic categories--tunnels and funnels;
<br>
spirals; lattices; and cobwebs.
<br>
<p>Based on new findings from optical imaging, in which scientists can
<br>
actually see which neurons light up in the visual cortex of cats and
<br>
monkeys when they view different lines and contours, Cowan, Bressloff
<br>
and their colleagues developed a mathematical model that can
<br>
accurately predict the shapes of different hallucinations.
<br>
<p>&quot;We calculated that given the kinds of anatomy in the visual cortex,
<br>
there are only four kinds of patterns it will make when it goes
<br>
unstable,&quot; Cowan said. &quot;It turns out that those four kinds of patterns
<br>
we get from the math correspond exactly to the four classes of
<br>
patterns that Kluver ended up with based on his looking at the drawings.&quot;
<br>
<p>Terry Sejnowski, director of the Salk Institute's Computational
<br>
Neurobiology Laboratory, said the work of Cowan and Bressloff could
<br>
have wide application in the areas of artificial intelligence and
<br>
artificial vision.
<br>
<p>&quot;They have created a mathematical model which replicates surprisingly
<br>
well the states that the brain gets into when it's having visual
<br>
hallucinations,&quot; he said. &quot;These hallucinatory states are really
<br>
abnormal conditions. Sometimes you learn a lot about a complex system
<br>
from the conditions which occur when it breaks down or when it's not
<br>
operating under normal conditions.&quot;
<br>
<p>The mathematical study of vision is also helping to explain near-death
<br>
experiences. Essentially they are physical representations of
<br>
striplike columns of neurons in the visual cortex that form a tunnel
<br>
pattern.
<br>
<p>&quot;What actually happens when somebody takes a drug is the first thing
<br>
they experience is a very bright light in the center of the visual
<br>
field, which is very reminiscent of this sort of light in the tunnel
<br>
when people think they see heaven beckoning in the distance,&quot;
<br>
Bressloff said.
<br>
<p>&quot;What seems to happen is that this bright light spreads across the
<br>
visual field and from that state then this structure emerges which is
<br>
the seed for the hallucination pattern,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Drug-Induced Drawings
<br>
<p>Since spirals, tunnels, zigzags and other hallucinatory patterns can
<br>
be found in the art of almost all cultures and go back more than
<br>
30,000 years, many anthropologists speculate that they were done under
<br>
the influence of hallucinogenic drugs or self-induced trances, and
<br>
that these experiences served as the origin of abstract art.
<br>
<p>The foremost masters of hallucinogenic experiences are shamans, ritual
<br>
practitioners in hunting-and-gathering societies who enter altered
<br>
states of consciousness to achieve a variety of ends that include
<br>
healing the sick, foretelling the future, meeting spirit-animals,
<br>
changing the weather and controlling animals by supernatural means,
<br>
according to Jean Clottes, scientific adviser to the French ministry
<br>
on prehistoric art, and David Lewis-Williams, professor of cognitive
<br>
archeology at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South
<br>
Africa.
<br>
<p>In their study of shamans, religious mystics and visionaries around
<br>
the world, Clottes and Lewis-Williams found that while drugs are
<br>
widely used to induce hallucinations, trances are also used to produce
<br>
unusual mental imagery. Trances can be induced through sensory
<br>
deprivation, prolonged social isolation, intense pain, vigorous
<br>
dancing and insistent, rhythmic sound, such as drumming and chanting.
<br>
<p>3 Stages Of Trances
<br>
<p>In their book, &quot;The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and Magic in the
<br>
Painted Caves,&quot; Clottes and Lewis-Williams outline three stages of
<br>
trance.
<br>
<p>In the first stage trance, people &quot;see&quot; geometric forms, such as dots,
<br>
zigzags, grids, parallel lines, nested curves and meandering lines. In
<br>
the second stage, subjects try to make better sense out of the
<br>
geometric imagery by illusioning them into objects of religious or
<br>
emotional significance, such as construing a zigzag line into a snake.
<br>
The third stage is reached via a vortex or tunnel, at the end of which
<br>
is a bright light. When people emerge from the tunnel they find
<br>
themselves in a bizarre world where geometric patterns become mixed
<br>
with monsters, people and settings. It is in this stage where the
<br>
drawings of humans with animal features occur.
<br>
<p>Clottes and Lewis-Williams concluded: &quot;We emphasize that these three
<br>
stages are universal and wired into the human nervous system, though
<br>
the meanings given to the geometrics of Stage 1, the objects into
<br>
which they are illusioned in Stage 2, and the hallucinations of Stage
<br>
3 are all culture-specific, at least in some measure, people
<br>
hallucinate what they expect to hallucinate.
