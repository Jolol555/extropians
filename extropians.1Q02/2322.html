<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;No envy here.  I just don't understand how some human beings (one not

<em>&gt; &gt; Ok. I am not saying this is fair, or how the world should be, However, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seems to be a part of randomness that serves,among other things evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are no longer slaves to evolution.  We have the power to ameliorate some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes now, and need not simply sit around letting them eat cake (to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forestall allocating some truly important things, like ... national health

</em><br>
<p>You know what? I'm dont' want to be a slave to evolution, but I don't
<br>
see anybody rewriting human DNA yet, so your statement is a mite
<br>
premature.
<br>
<p>However, you may recall that I have been unemployed for almost 10 months
<br>
now, yet I seem to be one of the most pro-capitalist voices here. If
<br>
capitalism were only about self interest, I should rationally be
<br>
plotting a socialist revolution right now, if I were serving my self
<br>
interest. 
<br>
<p>As an unemployed person, the only thing that motivates me to get out of
<br>
bed in the day is the hope of finding a job that will lead to a highly
<br>
lucrative career. If only average wage, dead end, seniority restricted,
<br>
union rule dictated jobs were available to me, THAT is when I'd start
<br>
plotting a revolution, if I had any motivation to get out of bed.
<br>
<p>Take away my hopes of captialist success, and you might as well just
<br>
shoot me.
<br>
<p>THIS is why capitalism works, and why nobody &quot;needs&quot; to prove that they
<br>
have a &quot;need&quot; for enormous wealth. The fact that they have it is its own
<br>
proof that the economy needs people as savvy as them to handle the
<br>
responsibility of all that capital. Government certainly can't manage
<br>
capital worth spit.
