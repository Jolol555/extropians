Do you guys mind?  Wise and ancient I may be, but not so ancient that I've
<br>
forgotten what it's like to be forced to read the Extropian mailing list
<br>
on a parentally owned computer.  Think of the children - not when you're
<br>
writing posts, of course, but at least when you're choosing subject
<br>
lines.  Subject lines give people (parents, casual visitors) their first
<br>
impression of a mailing list, and the subject lines are too short to
<br>
contain internal excuses and rational contexts, so be sure to choose your
<br>
subject lines carefully.
<br>
<p>Of course, being offended on behalf of others is not a good habit to pick
<br>
up, so let me emphasize that I am personally offended as well - albeit for
<br>
reasons which lie within my power to control, and are therefore, in
<br>
Crockerian terms, my fault.
<br>
<p>I don't think that profanity is inappropriate for all occasions, but I do
<br>
think that it shouldn't be overused, which definitely includes using it in
<br>
subject lines.  For example, I try to use the term &quot;damn&quot; only on special
<br>
occasions and reserve the other four-letter words for once-a-year use,
<br>
when I really want to blow my top.  Tolkien called routine profanity
<br>
&quot;orc-talk&quot;, emphasizing that is language from which all the vigor has been
<br>
drained, and I agree with him.  No orc-talk on Extropians, please!  Also,
<br>
I should note that I am beginning to feel nauseous not only about ad
<br>
hominem arguments, but also about the fight over whether someone may
<br>
perhaps have hinted at ad hominem somewhere - because I see it more as the
<br>
expression of continuing personal hatreds than as the discussion of a real
<br>
issue - and I see this particular use of orc-talk as a symptom of that as
<br>
well.
