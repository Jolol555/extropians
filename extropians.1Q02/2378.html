</em><br>
<p>Actually, coupling Milankovitch cycles with plate tectonic evolution of
<br>
oceanic currents, one can explain it all. 16 million years ago,
<br>
Antarctica broke away from South America, and the circumpolar current
<br>
began forming, isolating the continent from the rest of the world's
<br>
weather and operating a thermal vortex as a natural refrigeration system
<br>
whose function is to ventilate greater quantities of heat from the
<br>
southern ocean to space. This current stabilized about 14 million years
<br>
ago, and since then the southern ice cap has been stable ever since. At
<br>
this point in time, the 'ice line', which is the altitude at which ice
<br>
forms, is generally about 200 meters below the bedrock under the ice cap
<br>
around Antarctica.
<br>
<p>Variations in the Milankovich cycles can, in fact, also explain the
<br>
cooling and warming trend that has stretched from the middle ages to the
<br>
present. The peak of the 'little ice age' was around 1300 or so, when
<br>
Norse colonies in Greenland were wiped out, and things have warmed a bit
<br>
since then, not just in the past century, entirely in keeping with
<br>
Milankovitch's predictions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best explanation for _that_ which I've seen is the Himalaya
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis: the continuous and large supply of uplifted fresh rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been scrubbing CO2 out of the atmosphere.   (CO2 and rain react with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rock in the natural weathering process.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, that gives me an idea... if the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; melted from warming, there might be a countereffect of CO2 reacting with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all that fresh rock.
</em><br>
<p>But Antarctica will require a warming of around 15 degrees at a minimum
<br>
before it melts.
