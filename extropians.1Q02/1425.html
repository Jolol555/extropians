Poor (so-called) Central Meme of Transhumanism!
<br>
<p>Anders wants to drive a stake through its heart and dump it in a black hole 
<br>
and Max is not exactly enthusiastic about it:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No no no no no no no NO!!!!
</em><br>
<p>Let me clarify: I am not saying that we should purge transhumanism of any 
<br>
humanist or libertarian influences.
<br>
<p>What I am trying to say is that every ideological system will soon have to 
<br>
decide whether it is pro-CMT or against it. Those that will decide in 
<br>
favour, will not *have* to adopt whatever else transhumanists or extropians 
<br>
have to say on ethics or politics. Furthermore, as long as this is within 
<br>
the framework of western-style democracy (i.e. no nazis), I think that’s ok.
<br>
<p>As soon as the first effective CMT-enabling technologies begin to appear I 
<br>
expect a quick growth of the level of acceptance of the CMT, and when that 
<br>
happens transhumanism and extropy risk being left behind because neither has 
<br>
“exclusive rights” to  it. The  “going mainstream” of the CMT is something 
<br>
that should be welcomed by all tranhsumanists, but it does not automatically 
<br>
mean that transhumanism itself, or extropy (i.e. today’s ideologies that 
<br>
have grown around the CMT) will “go  mainstream” with it.
<br>
<p>This relative ease of “adoptability” of the CMT is something we should be 
<br>
very aware of, but it is not a bad thing: it will make life harder for the 
<br>
emerging anti-CMT alliance (i.e. the biological-religious conservatives).  
<br>
The CMT’s ease of adoptability should be kept firmly in mind because it 
<br>
could influence some important *tactical* moves, as Rafal  Smigrodzki has 
<br>
explained, better than I could:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;…when I suggest an ethics-free use of the word &quot;transhumanism&quot; I have &gt;the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;following goal in mind - our means (the use of technology to &gt;voluntarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change humanity), can and will be accepted by persons and &gt;movements with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethical principles differing from ours. It is likely &gt;that these will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups more similar to us than to Rifkinites, who &gt;are opposed to us as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter of principle. Yet, on the other hand, &gt;our potential allies in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support of technology will have enough &gt;ethical disagreements with us to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevent the formation of a single &gt;movement. By formulating a strategy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based on shared means (technology), rather &gt;than trying to package ethics, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politics *and* technology as a single &gt;all-encompassing world view, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be possible to achieve our &gt;goals faster. It is easier to build and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintain narrowly-focused &gt;alliances, with a lot of leeway for members.
</em><br>
<p>I think the above also implies that a purely pro-CMT movement, could gain a 
<br>
level of support and influence that ExI or the WTA could not reach, as their 
<br>
(minority) political views could then effectively become the limiting factor 
<br>
in their own growth.
<br>
<p>I am an ExI and WTA supporter (in that order). However, I do not 
<br>
realistically see how either of them could prevent  more politically 
<br>
mainstream movements from adopting the CMT and going on to become major 
<br>
players in the future fight for CMT acceptance, *once the CMT-enabling 
<br>
technologies are here.*
<br>
<p>This should be kept firmly in mind when making *tactical* decisions in the 
<br>
coming years (I stress the word tactical, because *strategically* the need 
<br>
for pro-CMT movements of a humanist and/or libertarian streak is still a 
<br>
clear necessity).
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
