<em>&gt; I think you miss the point, Harvey: &quot;work&quot; is, by definition, time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent in pursuits other than what would be one's first choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what to do with that time.  If you work for 12 hours to earn enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increase your lifespan by only 8 hours, then you haven't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased your &quot;life&quot; span at all--just your &quot;work&quot; span. You've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually lost 4 hours of &quot;life&quot;--life is doing what /you/ want with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your time.
</em><br>
<p>Man, you guys must really hate your jobs.
<br>
<p>Seriously, this definition:
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;work&quot; is, by definition, time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent in pursuits other than what would be one's first choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what to do with that time.  
</em><br>
<p>is really pretty sad. Just say someone had an idea about what they really
<br>
wanted to do, hmm, like research into nanotechnology, and went out and
<br>
acquired the skills. If said person then managed to get work in that field,
<br>
the work they wanted, what would you call that employment arrangement? A
<br>
paid hobby?
<br>
<p>The point here is that you could actually make money doing what you want to
<br>
do, and use that money to extend your life. This very cruddy tradeoff
<br>
relationship of Mike's, where you count hours worked = hours dead, would
<br>
then not apply (which I don't think it does anyway).
