Then Mike Lorrey said:
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, ceramic materials are the new thing in body armor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as in heavy military equipment. There was an interesting show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Discovery a week or so ago about an armored vest which sandwiches
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; 1/4&quot; plate of sintered ceramic between a couple thin sheets of kevlar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Effective against AP rifle rounds, even.
</em><br>
<p>This is very interesting to me. I was previously aware of ceramic
<br>
rifle-stopper
<br>
plates in the front and back of level III-c vests, but I didn't know
<br>
that it was that effective. Do you know who produced those? They are
<br>
prototype, I assume, as a google doesn't bring up anything like that,
<br>
precisely...
<br>
<p>Anyone have links to a good online explanatory page for some basic materials
<br>
science terminology and such, just so I don't have to collect quite so
<br>
many corrective posts, when i discover another exciting lil page?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>A material you may find of interest is CERMET.  It is a partially metallic,
<br>
and partially ceramic mixture, discovered at Los Alamos (accidently).  Boron
<br>
Carbide (The ceramic) is held as a powder in the desired shape, in the most
<br>
common form, Aluminium is then melted and allowed to diffuse throughout the
<br>
material.  The result (depending on how long you let it cool in an oxygen
<br>
rich environment) is a material that has a very high fracture toughness, and
<br>
is 6 times stronger than aluminum, but less dense.  A 1/2, reportadly, can
<br>
stop a tank shell (no more specifics than that off the top of my head)
<br>
LANL.gov internal search engine is apparently down at the moment.
