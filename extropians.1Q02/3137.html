<em>&gt; (Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Special%20difficulties%20of%20AI%20terminology">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somewhere in an alternate universe, there is a version of Eliezer Yudkowsky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who publishes &quot;leisurely&quot; scientific papers, and one of those papers is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled &quot;Special difficulties consequent to research on generally intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supersystems.&quot;  I'll probably never get to write that paper.  But I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publish a small excerpt from that alternate universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now I'm trying to use standard words, without neologism, and yet this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involves a new problem:  I'm rapidly running out of words.  If you discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally intelligent supersystems, then not only will you need to overload an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immense number of words, but furthermore they will be very abstract words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones that would otherwise play a strong supporting role in abstract language. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my paper, I can no longer say &quot;the past concept that children have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical abilities&quot;; I have to say &quot;the past notion that children have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical abilities&quot;.  &quot;Concept&quot; has already been overloaded as a technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term.  I have to use &quot;notion&quot; or &quot;idea&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recently I wanted to discuss the second part of a trigger - you know, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing that happens after the condition part is satisfied - and I found that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't.  &quot;Action&quot; was long since overloaded to describe a deliberate action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the AI.  &quot;Sequitur&quot;, which would have been appropriate in this case, had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been used somewhere more important.  I'd used up the space of causal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminology and the only words left didn't really describe what I wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say - &quot;consequence&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; and &quot;outcome&quot;, for example, treat the action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (sigh) as static, rather than as an active force.  And at that I was lucky the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper didn't go into causality in more detail, or I would probably have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced to use up &quot;consequence&quot;, &quot;effect&quot;, and &quot;outcome&quot; as well.  At one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, faced with the prospect of being forced to overload the term &quot;problem&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to describe a virtual-environment challenge presented by the programmer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teach a concept or belief, I took the coward's way out.  I called it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;microenvironmental challenge&quot;, abbreviating it as &quot;MEC&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you can avoid neologism, but it's going to come at a cost; describing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought processes abstractly often consumes a term that we use in ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract thinking.  Maybe when I'm done with the first draft, I'll be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go back and reparse the language space more precisely and get rid of some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current problems.  For example, on reflection (and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thesaurus-hunting), I think that &quot;microtask&quot; may do to replace the neologistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;MEC&quot;.  But don't be too quick to blame the creators of neologisms until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've walked a few miles in their thesauruses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>Why avoid neologism at all?  When treating specific concepts within a
<br>
field, and especially within a specific paper, neologizing in much
<br>
preferred to overloading.  Indeed, I might argue that creating new words
<br>
for new concepts is part and parcel of the cretive process itself.  The
<br>
only thing that's bad is creating new words for old concepts that people
<br>
already understand--crackpots do that to hide the fact that they aren't
<br>
actually creating new ideas but just dressing up old ones.  If your ideas
<br>
are truly new and different (or even just more specific in an important
<br>
way), then by all means makeup new terms.  I wouldn't be able to teach
<br>
you about poker strategy without using a bunch of terms like &quot;outs&quot; and
<br>
&quot;counterfeits&quot; and &quot;free cards&quot; and &quot;drawing dead&quot;.  Why should I expect
<br>
you to be able to explain AI to me without first defining some new
<br>
terminology?
