<p>Since this is the Extropian List and not the Deluded Magical Thinking List,
<br>
probably most readers will have blipped over this post with a sigh. But
<br>
since it's such a classic but truly dopey New Age claim that people can
<br>
change traffic lights by wishing, it might be interesting to prod it a bit.
<br>
<p>How would the world have to be for this to work? More exactly, how would
<br>
traffic light systems have to be?
<br>
<p>(We could do a different kind of analysis and ask how it's possible, if
<br>
such an effect really occurs, for lights *ever* to change to allow
<br>
cross-highway traffic through. Obviously there are always many more people
<br>
wishing for the busy stream to have green lights all the way through, and
<br>
their magickal wishes should sum to keep the light always switched their
<br>
way. But that might not be how magick works; perhaps there's a cosmic bean
<br>
counter that maintains a certain even-handedness in the world.)
<br>
<p>No, what I'm asking--as I do when my sweet, endlessly gullible
<br>
sister-in-law tells me of her inner power over traffic lights--is: how is
<br>
the mechanism of traffic lights vulnerable to this magickal power? 
<br>
<p>Isn't there usually a hardware timer inside the things that switches from
<br>
red to green and back at pre-set intervals? (Leave aside manually-tweaked
<br>
systems where an operator views a bunch of intersections on screen and
<br>
routes around accidents, smooths the flow, etc.) 
<br>
<p>I don't know the answer, but I assume most traffic lights are just not the
<br>
kinds of mechanisms that can be influenced from the outside, except by
<br>
pressing a button on the street corner. But of course a *huge* proportion
<br>
of pedestrians act is if they believe traffic lights can be coerced or
<br>
propitiated by hitting the button repeatedly. That might not be magical
<br>
thinking, though, just displaced frustration. I found a woman at a busy
<br>
intersection the other day hammering repeatedly at the button, and asked
<br>
her politely why she was doing it. `Because I'm frustrated,' she said with
<br>
a grin. `Yes, but you don't actually think that it affects the--?' `No, but
<br>
it makes me feel better.' `Okay.' It also wears out the mechanism more
<br>
rapidly, I suppose. But I suspect that she was smarter than many people; I
<br>
really think that many people believe that if you slam the button ten or 20
<br>
times the lights will change more quickly.
<br>
<p>Any traffic light experts on the list?
