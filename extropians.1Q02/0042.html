<em>&gt;What was the Chatsworth situation?
</em><br>
<p>Admittedly, I only know most of the details second-hand, so it wouldn't be 
<br>
fair for me to go into it.  Chalk it up to a failed cryonics enterprise a 
<br>
number of years ago in Southern California, where preserved patient upkeep 
<br>
was almost non-existent.  The patients eventually thawed and started to rot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, what about the experiments done by Alcor with rabbit and dog brains? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And what about the slides presented in the Asilomar conference by Dr. Greg 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fahy, which showed the amazing improvements made through vitrification?
</em><br>
<p>Well, such improvements are all good and well, but my point is that such 
<br>
improvements *seem* to work on a dead rabbit and dog, but not on a live 
<br>
human.  Don't get me wrong: I do hope that progress in research constantly 
<br>
gets done, but it still ultimately comes down to a question of faith in any 
<br>
given organization's ability to primarily suspend you &quot;well,&quot; and stay 
<br>
around long enough to &quot;bring you back&quot; when the technology presents 
<br>
itself.  I do have a fair amount of faith in forthcoming technology (I 
<br>
probably wouldn't be an extropian if I didn't), but I have marginally less 
<br>
faith in an organization's current suspension techniques as well as 
<br>
long-term staying power as a business.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It does seem to me Dr. Jerry lemler is determined to raise Alcor to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next level. Whether or not he gets the funding to do so is very questionable.
</em><br>
<p>I truly hope that Lemler can raise Alcor to the next level (whatever that 
<br>
may be), but keep in mind that he is just one man, and had no experience 
<br>
with cryonics until just under a year ago.  I don't know enough about 
<br>
Alcor's current protocol to know whether or not he has made any difference 
<br>
for good or ill.  It disturbs me somewhat that there have been no 
<br>
scientifically detailed suspension reports being published publicly since 
<br>
he has taken over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;you continue:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A lot of people will fall back on the idea that &quot;any chance is better than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no chance;&quot; I agree that such is true...but when that &quot;any chance&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;.000001% as opposed to, say, 5%, then is that chance worth spending at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least $28,000 (CI's numbers) on? I'm not so sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(end)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you mean to say the odds with CI are .000001% and for Alcor 5%?? I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think I have more &quot;faith&quot; in cryonics than you do. lol
</em><br>
<p>Please don't misinterpret what I said.  The percentages I mentioned are 
<br>
purely hypothetical.  I don't know if Alcor or CI can claim a 5% chance of 
<br>
re-animation, nor do I know if they can only claim .000001%.  As for you 
<br>
having more &quot;faith&quot; in cryonics than I do, I should certainly hope so!  You 
<br>
have money on it...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So Sean, do you think biotech within thirty or forty years will make us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;near-immortals? Do you feel for those of us fairly young and healthy that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryonics will not be necessary?
</em><br>
<p>I honestly don't know.  I am 22 now, and I figure I have a fairly good 
<br>
chance at reaching 100, a decent chance at reaching a few decades more, and 
<br>
a much less convincing chance I can hit 200.  I don't really foresee any 
<br>
huge breakthroughs in biotech that will automatically extend our lifespans 
<br>
dramatically, but I think more incremental steps will come along more and 
<br>
more regularly.  I think that the primary limits to extended life will be 
<br>
political and social, rather than technological.  Governments are generally 
<br>
xenophobic by nature.  When working nanotech is in its infant stages, I 
<br>
expect to see it strictly regulated in most countries; likewise with most 
<br>
other foreseeable life-changing developments.
