<p>&lt;&lt; How do we know we can fulfill all the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp;1) live in a computer simulation
<br>
&nbsp;2) have sentient beings outside the simulation taking an interest in us
<br>
&nbsp;3) that sentient beings actually bringing us &quot;alive&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;4) that they will treat us with pleasant circumstances
<br>
&nbsp;5) that no accidents will occur to break this thread of events (like a 
<br>
computer crash)
<br>
<em>  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
I am not guaranteeing anything. I had no part in the design of reality and 
<br>
hold no other person to blame or credit for the way the universe is.
<br>
<p>And....
<br>
&lt;&lt;6) that we have a sufficient definition of what we call the &quot;self&quot;
<br>
[what do we mean by the self?]
<br>
<p>7) that it still matters after we die (as our &quot;original&quot; consciousness had 
<br>
disappeared
<br>
[if someone made a copy of you and instantiate you at another place, does it 
<br>
matter to the original &quot;you&quot;?]
<br>
<p>8) that our host universe will last forever, or it consists of a simulation 
<br>
that will fulfill the above creteria and this forever
<br>
(in a never-ending loop)&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Again, we were just engaging in pendantic speculations. If we had some 
<br>
effective control then...
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;What if we have to die one day? How would we confront with the situation 
<br>
that, despite our technological powress and knowledge, we
<br>
will still have to die?

<p>&lt;&lt;What if we have to die one day? How would we confront with the situation 
<br>

<br>
will still have to die?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We will. We shall, unless a miracle technology comes along, or cryonics 
<br>
proves correct.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It does not matter who and what preprogrammed, predisposed or did whatever 
<br>
to our universe, but why do we even bother to continue subjecting ourselves 
<br>
to these assuming that we could break free of these and look at the question 
<br>
objectively. The factual answers may give an apparent meaning, but that 
<br>
provides only an illusion (or a &quot;sham&quot;, as Plato puts it).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>You have your life as for as long as you are murdered, die by mishap or 
<br>
disease or suicide. How do you wish to spend your remaining time? Some of us 
<br>
look for solutions in religious brainwashing, others seem to be like B.F. 
<br>
Skinner, and deliberately focus on other matters, some believe technical 
<br>
miracles will sustain us, until we achieve a computerized singularity, a few 
<br>
others like myself attempt to build immanginary castles in the air, based on 
<br>
aspects of physics. If you are asking why live beyond a few decades, I would 
<br>
say that there are some interesting things I would like to see  and do, other 
<br>
then my &quot;alotted&quot; time. What about yourself?
