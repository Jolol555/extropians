Yes, well, it's all hype. the advantages of NNs, as these guys almost say,
<br>
&nbsp;are that they can learn things without rules and that some learning
<br>
&nbsp;algorithms can use relatively unstructured data. this makes them ideal for
<br>
&nbsp;areas where we don't know what's going on (rules) or how to descrbe the
<br>
&nbsp;phenomena involved (data), such as meaning and consciousness.
<br>
&nbsp;the disadvantages of NNs are that we don't know how to design them (we can
<br>
&nbsp;build an infinite number of physically/logically different NNs, but we
<br>
&nbsp;don't know how this affects their properties) and we don't know what
<br>
&nbsp;they'll learn given a particular set of data: it's all trial and error. in
<br>
&nbsp;this respect, Star Trek's Data is not too far from the truth.
<br>
Lots of people have applied NNs to speech synth/rec, with some success.
<br>
&nbsp;the current vogue in ASR is for hybrid HMM+NN systems . NN applications in
<br>
ASR are quite promising,
<br>
&nbsp;because there are many complex low-level phenomena which we can't describe
<br>
&nbsp;with rules but we can say what the right answer is (e.g. 10**n wavefomrs
<br>
&nbsp;of the utterance &quot;fish&quot; by different people, all different, but all
<br>
&nbsp;signifying the same thing).
<br>
&nbsp;Applications of NNs to TTS are rarer, mainly because most of the problems
<br>
&nbsp;can be solved by rule and those which cannot are beyond our ability to
<br>
&nbsp;describe in enough detail for a NN application (e.g. the meaning of the
<br>
&nbsp;text, the emotional content of the speech, the details of the acoustic
<br>
&nbsp;transitions between sounds, ...).
<br>
There are a few things we could consider doing with NNs - augmenting our
<br>
&nbsp;ASR, adding meaning/emotion to TTS, or even investigating the contextual
<br>
&nbsp;effects on acoustic transitions.
<br>
What thinkest thou?
