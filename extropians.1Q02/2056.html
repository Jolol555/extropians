Dear Extropes,
<br>
<p>In the Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome last weekend was an Alfred
<br>
Stieglitz photo exhibit, featuring his photos (not enough), early
<br>
black &amp; white photos (many) from the origins of photography, and pieces
<br>
from his 'zine: &quot;Camera Work&quot;. This small magazine featured artists,
<br>
writers, painters, photographers, sculptors, etc. of all kinds, with
<br>
insightful essays.
<br>
<p>One of Stieglitz' features in his Camera Work magazine was Mina
<br>
Loy's: 'Aphorisms on Futurism', 45 (January 1914): 13-15. While I
<br>
was in the exhibit hall, I copied some of the aphorisms that I
<br>
thought most interesting, which I show below. Serafino found some
<br>
information about this piece and more info about her.
<br>
<p>The full reference is here:
<br>
&quot;Aphorisms on Futurism.&quot;
<br>
Camera Work, 45 (January 1914): 13-15.

<br>
Ed. and Introd. Jonathan Green. New York:
<br>
Aperture, 1973. 276-7. Rpt. Last Lunar Baedeker, 272-275.
<br>
<p>I had never heard these aphorisms before, and I had never heard
<br>
of Mina Loy before (even though she was spending time with the
<br>
most famous artists of that time).
<br>
<p>She's a remarkable woman. Creative. Bold.

<br>
<p><p><p>some of Mina Loy's &quot;Aphorisms on Futurism&quot;:
<br>
<p><p>* Die in the past.  Live in the future.
<br>
<p>* The Futurist can live a thousand years in one poem.
<br>
<p>* Love the hideous in order to find the sublime core of it.
<br>
<p>* In pressing the material to derive its essence, matter becomes
<br>
defined.
<br>
<p>* Forget that you live in houses, so that you may live in yourself.
<br>
<p>* What can you know of expansion; those who limit yourselves to compromise?
<br>
<p>* Love of others is appreciation of oneself.
<br>
<p>* Life is only limited by our prejudices. Destroy them, and you cease
<br>
to be at the mercy of yourself.
<br>
<p>* Time is the dispersion of intensiveness.
<br>
<p>* The future is limitless- the past is a trail of insidious reactions.
<br>
<p>* The future is only dark from the outside. Leap into it, and it
<br>
_explodes_ with Light.
<br>
<p>* The smallest person is as great as the Universe.
<br>
<p>* May your egotism be so gigantic that you compromise mankind in
<br>
your self-sympathy.
