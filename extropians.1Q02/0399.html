&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter below was published on the old Insane Science
<br>
Mailing List 15 months ago. Disappointingly, it drew very little
<br>
comment there. I really hope to see more here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once again, anyone who judges this posting to be
<br>
&quot;anti-science&quot; (or anti-government, for that matter) is SEVERELY
<br>
misreading it. That would be like accusing me of being anti-home
<br>
remodeling because I strongly disliked home remodeler John Gacy.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few decades we've seen revealed numerous scandals 
<br>
linking medical personel and other scientists with murder. I am not 
<br>
talking about people like Donald Harvey [so help me, he and I had 
<br>
mutual friends] and Dr. Michael Joseph Swango. I am speaking, rather, 
<br>
of murders carried out with government approval.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients were &quot;treated&quot; for syphillis, but only given placebos, 
<br>
to see if they'd develop paresis and/or die from their infections 
<br>
(they did); injected with plutonium to see whether they'd develop 
<br>
carcinomas and die (they did); fed various concoctions to see whether
<br>
sane people could thereby be driven psychotic (they could); given
<br>
LSD to see if they'd commit bizarre acts (they did); and - we now 
<br>
learn - injected with a particularly virulent form of measles just so 
<br>
death rates could be statistically established.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all of these cases, &quot;treatment&quot; was carried out without the 
<br>
patients' knowledge or consent. In addition, the scientific
<br>
knowledge gained was practically nil - I could have answered most of 
<br>
these questions from my seventh grade science text. Indeed, all of 
<br>
these projects seem to have been merely a slightly more sophisticated 
<br>
version of throwing people off the tops of tall buildings to see 
<br>
whether the laws of gravity still hold true.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has apologized for all these things, of course, 
<br>
except for the attempted genocide of the Yanomami Indians, and that 
<br>
will follow as certainly as Tuesday follows Monday. Money will be
<br>
paid off (the government will find a more flowery word than &quot;pay 
<br>
off,&quot; of course), and Congress will insist that a few poeple, here
<br>
and there, get letters of reprimand shoved deep into their employment
<br>
file jackets. The Yanomami Indians will receive a handful of
<br>
playgrounds, a school or two, and even a hospital (I strongly suggest
<br>
that they not use the last).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, once again, murder carried out in the name of science will 
<br>
be treated as a CIVIL matter. It is NEVER a CRIMINAL one. Injecting 
<br>
patients with plutonium may or not be frowned upon, but it is NOT a 
<br>
CRIME. You DON'T go to prison or to the electric chair for it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until murder or physical or psychological mutilation as  
<br>
government-approved experimentation is made as much a crime as 
<br>
shooting clerks in liquor stores, and treated as seriously, the 
<br>
genocide will continue. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I don't have either the time or the space to list all the 
<br>
reasons why I consider this posting to be neither anti-science nor 
<br>
anti-government.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments, anyone?
