<p>Certainly many.  At first I was inclined to agree with you.  But on 
<br>
reflection,
<br>
I recalled that the hindu Vedas are an *oral* document - the rote-memorized
<br>
recitation trumps any written instantiation.  Likewise the
<br>
Zoroatrian Gathas were preserved by rote even after their literal meanings
<br>
were lost, and the dating of Zoroastrianism derives from linguistic dating of
<br>
the proto-Iranian language they embody.
<br>
<p>As I think of religions as meme-complexes, I consider accurate long-term
<br>
preservation of memetic content the essential innovation.  Writing, without
<br>
doubt, provides a spectacular preservation medium, and does not require
<br>
the massive amounts of study and time verbal recitations require.   So
<br>
writing should boost the spread and survival of religions.  That
<br>
religions post-date writing (excepting probably Hinduism and Zoroastrianism)
<br>
may mostly be an epiphenomenom of the fact that powerful religions need
<br>
sophisticated societies to create them, and sophisticated societies generally
<br>
develop writing too.
