</em><br>
<p>Mortgages are good.  They allow us to have better homes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And the above does not take into account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trillions of additional indebtedness at the state and local level.
</em><br>
<p>Government indebtedness keeps governments stable.  If your
<br>
government owes you money you will be less likely to overthrow it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note the first of these links showing the stagnation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; median income and the overall economic weakness of the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class.
</em><br>
<p>Our middle class is in great shape.  They have cars, clothes,
<br>
plenty to eat.  They work, they produce stuff.  If people get
<br>
too rich, they wont work and stuff doesnt get produced.  Stagnation
<br>
of the middle class is a good thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Clearly something is not so rosy in this supposed best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of economies.
</em><br>
<p>Looks pretty rosy to me Samantha, and Im one of the
<br>
middle class proles that gets up every morning and fights
<br>
traffic to get to my job.  Traffic is a good thing.  It is
<br>
people, surging to get to work and make good things
<br>
happen!  Its the pulse of a healthy economy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All of that sounds fine in principle.  But what will you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the huge debts we are under?
</em><br>
<p>Work hard, pay it off.  Keep your butt to the grindstone.  Builds
<br>
character.  Gets things done.  Makes things happen.  Good old
<br>
fear of economic ruin keeps people off the streets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  They are eating away at our properity.
</em><br>
<p>Prosperity schmosperity.  We have more wealth than we know
<br>
what to do with.  Something hasta eat it, or we would waste our
<br>
lives on endless round of masturbation and daytime TV.  Talent
<br>
would be wasted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  What will you do when/if the number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working and with the means to help those not working goes below
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the amount that by any stretch of the imagination can cover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thsoe without jobs?
</em><br>
<p>Then we will solve that problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  What will you do when the federal debt is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so high that even the interest on it swamps taxes collected and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the boomers retire and expect the money that has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; siphoned off into the debt?
</em><br>
<p>Then we will solve that problem.  The underlying wealth of
<br>
this planet is elegantly sufficient to feed everyone, to feed
<br>
thrice as many as we now have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be nice if there are clean, easy, straight-forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers.  But I do not know of them if there are such.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Samantha, do not be a gloom-miester.  Our world's problems
<br>
are many, but for each one there is a gang of big hairy
<br>
solutions waiting to pounce on it.  spike
