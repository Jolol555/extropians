Here is the complete  article I snipped the early information  from, pardon
<br>
for not including it all for proper context, my bad.
<br>
<p>INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 1: PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS
<br>
The expression of some genes is more favorable when it takes place in young
<br>
animals than when it takes place after animals are older. The existence of
<br>
differences in the effect of a gene's expression depending upon where it
<br>
acts or the time of its expression are called pleiotropic effects.
<br>
The effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) looks more and more like
<br>
a pleiotropic effect. In mammals, IGF-1, released in response to growth
<br>
hormone, stimulates growth and wound healing. As mammals age, however, it
<br>
appears that IGF-1 may increase the likelihood of developing cancer, because
<br>
it increases cellular division. It is well known that mitogens, substances
<br>
that increase cell division, can increase the risk of cancer simply because
<br>
the more times a cell divides, the more chances there are for a mistake to
<br>
take place that will result in loss of proliferative control. In older
<br>
humans, elevated levels of IGF-1 have been reported to be associated with
<br>
increased risks of prostate and breast cancer.
<br>
Thus, we find that IGF-1 is associated with retinopathy because it
<br>
stimulates the neovascularization (excess formation of blood vessels in the
<br>
retina) that underlies retinopathy. While it is obviously important to be
<br>
able to grow new blood vessels in case of injury, in response to exercise,
<br>
and during preadult growth and development, in the long run there may be a
<br>
pathological downside of excessive growth of blood vessels in some places,
<br>
such as the retina (retinopathy) or in tumors (angiogenesis).
<br>
With regard to calorically restricted mice, there has been a report1 that
<br>
the IGF-1 receptor density increases with age (as compared to no consistent
<br>
changes in ad lib-fed animals with age), accompanied by a decrease in IGF-1
<br>
levels and an increase in growth-hormone release. IGF-1 levels increase in
<br>
ad lib-fed aging mice and in aging humans, while growth-hormone release
<br>
decreases with age.
<br>
The amplitude of growth-hormone secretory pulses decreases with age in ad
<br>
lib-fed animals, and short-term caloric restriction in young animals also
<br>
results in a decline in the amplitude of growth hormone.  However, in older
<br>
caloric-restricted animals, growth-hormone pulses were similar to those in
<br>
young ad lib-fed mice, with both the number of pulses of growth hormone and
<br>
mean growth hormone concentrations increased substantially compared to older
<br>
ad lib-fed mice. Apparently, there is a long-term adjustment that takes
<br>
place in the growth hormone and IGF-1 axis in chronically calorically
<br>
restricted mice so that, even with 40% less food (called &quot;moderate caloric
<br>
restriction&quot; to distinguish it from outright starvation), the animals have
<br>
greater protein synthesis, along with greater growth-hormone and lower IGF-1
<br>
levels.
<br>
Another study2 reports that in 24 postmenopausal women aged 57 and older who
<br>
had taken long-term estrogen replacement treatment (83% for ten years or
<br>
more), there were higher growth-hormone levels and lower IGF-1 levels than
<br>
in estrogen nonusers. The long-term estrogen users had higher mean
<br>
circulating GH levels and more frequent GH secretory bursts (though the
<br>
amplitude of the GH bursts was no greater than in the nonusers), along with
<br>
lower IGF-1 levels. All hormone users were taking 0.625 mg a day of Premarin
<br>
for at least three years prior to the study. Whether the higher GH/lower
<br>
IGF-1 has similar youth-promoting implications to the higher GH/lower IGF-1
<br>
of caloric restriction is something we don't know. It should be noted that
<br>
the decrease in IGF-1 levels was specific to oral estrogen replacement
<br>
therapy (ERT) and did not apply to transdermal ERT. The authors state that
<br>
oral but not transdermal ERT results in high liver-portal estrogen
<br>
concentrations, and estrogen inhibits liver IGF-1 synthesis. Hence, the
<br>
lower IGF-1 levels may be a direct effect on the liver.
