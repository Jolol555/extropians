</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Mike, what you say might be a tricky way to observe the ETs, however, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real trick is to find a means where we can sustain the knowledge. It may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that your proposals has been tried dozens of times and we have discovered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the existence of nanobots each time. The trouble of course is that each time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nanobots destroy the relevant knowledge. For example, they erase the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical records and replace the memories of conducting the experiment with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something else. Think of the ET nanobots as akin to a virus. We need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that would discover and purge the virus in one fell swoop. Here's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sad thought: everytime our civilization verges on discovering nano and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI history is reset. Imagine that the nanobots destroy all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure of our civilization and recreate the world as it was in 495
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BC.  Presumably many people would have to be purged, since there are so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more today, and those that remained would have to have their memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altered. Bummer. Mark.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but here is the really tricky part:
<br>
I am running said experiment (hypothetically) and I want to ensure that
<br>
I am free of influence, so I make sure that I am fully aware the
<br>
pheresis procedure is a cover for a nanite detecting mission, and submit
<br>
MYSELF for pheresis. Since I know its to detect nanites, then any
<br>
nanites inside me will also know this, and will evacuate my body
<br>
temporarily, long enough to get real results and broadcast them to the
<br>
world.
