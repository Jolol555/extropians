<em>&gt; Are you denying that people today, even quite a few right here 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US of A, have insufficient clothing, housing and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutrition to even be healthy, much less participate fully? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you say may be true but it does not automatically work out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that everyone gets what they need or the means to earn what they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need either.  That is my point.  What do you think should be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done in such cases?  Are our theories of how it should work out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be clung to even while people, some of them children in our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own country, are in this shape?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, there are poor.  It is also an undeniable fact that
<br>
the freest economies in the world have the fewest poor and the
<br>
richest poor.  There is so much surplus food here that the poor
<br>
in America are more likely to suffer from obesity than starvation;
<br>
housing and health care are the biggest problems. It's no
<br>
accident that food is almost a free market but housing and
<br>
health care are heavily regulated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see the arguments for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goodness of the theory and I see the suffering ones at the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.  I do not know if I have the best answer but I think I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a very valid question that cannot be easily swept aside by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere theory.
</em><br>
<p>Dammit, I'm not the one offering empty theories, you are.
<br>
I'm talking about the actual evidence available to anyone
<br>
who will just open their eyes: look at the conditions
<br>
of /everyone/ on the planet and reason from that evidence.
<br>
Sure, there is suffering; but a rational human being has to
<br>
compare what suffering exists under our present system to that
<br>
under other systems, draw inferences about what makes them
<br>
different, and then extrapolate to what we can improve.  The
<br>
facts--not theory, facts--are that free markets feed people,
<br>
and to the extent that we still have failures, there are
<br>
clearly regulatory obstacles to real solutions.
<br>
<p>Crying &quot;something must be done&quot; doesn't even rise to the
<br>
level of coherent theory--it's just an emotional reaction.
<br>
There's nothing wrong with compassion, but compassion feeds
<br>
the same number of people as &quot;theory&quot;--i.e., none.  But at
<br>
least the theory has a historical record leading to more
<br>
people being fed than at anytime in history.  I don't
<br>
support the free market because it's a pretty theory.  I
<br>
support it because it is /proven/ to work in /reality/.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Go look at the homeless and then claim this.  Go look at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects a bit more closely.  Look into the some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-parent homes that now do not qualify for welfare and can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find no work or source of income equal to what they once had. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you ignoring them or claiming they don't exist or that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not relevant?
</em><br>
<p>You're not listening: what I'm claiming is that the best way
<br>
to help them is to remove the /cause/ oftheir poverty by making
<br>
the economy more free, and to trust in compassionate humans
<br>
like youand me to fill the gaps where needed.  Voluntary
<br>
compassion works, I only oppose compassion at gunpoint, like
<br>
welfare programs and housing projects and other proven failures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry.  The real world does not work like your ideals.  Not even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.  Certainly not in less developed countries.  So what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens to these people while we wait for your theory to work? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens if your theory is wrong?
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;real world&quot; has /proven/ to work more by my &quot;ideals&quot; than
<br>
by what I'm assuming are yours--and I'm assuming because you
<br>
haven't actually offered any solutions yourself.  Certainly now,
<br>
and in the period during which we create a more free economy,
<br>
compassionate people will have to help those in need--I've never
<br>
said anything different.  But it is a moral imperative to fight
<br>
the /cause/ of poverty, and to improve the condition of the
<br>
future, and I am doing that--by fighting government regulation
<br>
and restrictions on free trade--because my conscience demands
<br>
it.  To do anything less would be an empty, false pretense of
<br>
compassion, not the real thing.
