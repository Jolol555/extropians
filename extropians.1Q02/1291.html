Subject: Re: The Politics of Transhumanism
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; First of all, a definition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Central meme of transhumanism (CMT):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is right to use technology to improve on Homo Sapiens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Actually, I think the idea of technology being the central meme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is horribly wrong, and if we present ourselves based on *that*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we will lose much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I must be philosophically challenged, because, in my view, if you
</em><br>
take
<br>
<em>&gt; away *that*, all is left of transhumanism is just some version of
</em><br>
humanism.
<br>
<em>&gt; That is exactly what the mainstream is likely to see and it will then
</em><br>
behave
<br>
<em>&gt; accordingly, i.e. it will adopt CMT and it will treat transhumanism in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly the same way as it treats humanism today. it will largely ignore
</em><br>
it
<br>
I think you have misunderstood the point here. What you call the CMT is
<br>
actually the conjunction of the three thesis:
<br>
It is (1) right to use (2) technology to (3) improve on Homo Sapiens.
<br>
Anders cited my analysis thus,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Mark Walker pointed out, technological transformation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really just one part of a triad of ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm">http://www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm</a> : &quot;1. The Technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thesis: Within a hundred years humanity will possess the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology to reengineer Homo sapiens.  2. The Ideal Thesis: The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal in the reengineering task is to perfect ourselves. 3. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ethical Thesis: We ought to employ technology to realize this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal.&quot;).
</em><br>
A pure form of the technology thesis is simply the idea that technology can
<br>
be used to transform humans. This is what I think Anders is rejecting when
<br>
he says that this should not be understood as the central meme of
<br>
transhumanism. Technology, after all, might be used to make humans better
<br>
slaves, or instruments of a fascist state. (Just to be clear, this is not
<br>
transhumanism). Your analysis of a single meme smuggles in the idea that
<br>
Person Engineering Technology (PET) is to be used to move towards an
<br>
ideal--I assume that this is what you mean by &quot;improvement&quot;, and
<br>
furthermore, there is a gesture to ethics, I assume this is what you mean by
<br>
&quot;right&quot;. The technology thesis without the ethical and ideal thesis is
<br>
amoral and blind. Without the technology thesis, the ideal and ethical
<br>
theses without are impotent. I don't think there is a central meme of these
<br>
three. What is the central meme of the concept of a bachelor? Is it more
<br>
important to be male or unmarried? The question verges on unintelligibility,
<br>
as does the question of which of this triad is the central meme. Mark.
