Subject: URGENT! Full-page ad in USA Today?

X-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)
<br>
<p>Dear Libertarian:
<br>
<p>Would you like to spit in the eye of America's biggest Drug Warrior?
<br>
<p>Would you like to prove to millions of Americans that the latest
<br>
government Drug War propaganda isn't just wrong -- it STINKS like a
<br>
rotting fish?
<br>
<p>Would you like to garner nationwide publicity for the Libertarian
<br>
Party? Perhaps even get us on the nightly news?
<br>
<p>We have an opportunity to do all that. But only if we raise $69,800 by
<br>
Friday.
<br>
<p>That's a lot of money, but the potential pay-off is huge.
<br>
<p>When you hear our bold plan -- and SEE what we propose -- I think
<br>
you'll agree.
<br>
<p>In fact, I think you'll laugh out loud with delight.
<br>
<p>First, some background.
<br>
<p>The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has launched a new
<br>
advertising campaign that attempts to link drugs with terrorism.
<br>
<p>The campaign got underway with two TV ads during the Super Bowl. The
<br>
cost to taxpayers: $3.4 million!
<br>
<p>One of the ads, which pretended to show terrorists buying weapons,
<br>
asked: &quot;Where do terrorists get their money? If you buy drugs, some of
<br>
it might come from you.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the other ad, young people made matter-of-fact statements like, &quot;I
<br>
helped kill a judge.&quot;
<br>
<p>The ads were so outrageous that we issued a press release calling them
<br>
&quot;Super Bowloney.&quot;
<br>
<p>We noted: &quot;For the Office of National Drug Control Policy to claim that
<br>
drug users are to blame for financing terrorists is like a maniac who
<br>
kills his parents, and then throws himself on the mercy of the court
<br>
because he is an orphan.&quot;
<br>
<p>We said: &quot;The fact is, the War on Drugs CAUSES the very problem these
<br>
ads complain about. It turns ordinary, cheap plants like marijuana and
<br>
poppies into fantastically lucrative black market products. The War on
<br>
Drugs enriches terrorists, finances violence, and makes America less
<br>
safe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, ONDCP bureaucrats don't read our press releases. Or just
<br>
don't care about the truth.
<br>
<p>Last week, they rolled out the print version of the campaign, with
<br>
full-page ads in 293 newspapers around the USA.
<br>
<p>One ad shows a young woman's face. The text reads: &quot;Last week, I washed
<br>
my car, hung out with a few friends, and helped murder a family in
<br>
Colombia.&quot;
<br>
<p>The bottom of the ad says: &quot;Drug money helps support terror. Buy drugs
<br>
and you could be supporting it too.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unbelievable!
<br>
<p>The ad ignores the fact that the War on Drugs -- and the black markets
<br>
it spawns -- drives up the price of illegal drugs by as much as 17,000%
<br>
(according to the Hoover Institution).
<br>
<p>Without the War on Drugs, there would be no link between drugs and
<br>
terrorism, and the financial engine that fuels many terrorist
<br>
organizations would sputter to a halt.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(At the end of this message, I'll give you a link to the ONDCP ads,
<br>
and you can see them for yourself. I don't want you to think we're
<br>
exaggerating.)
<br>
<p>The ONDCP's strategy is clear: It's trying to take the September 11-
<br>
inspired hatred of terrorists, and use it to bolster the failing War on
<br>
Drugs.
<br>
<p>And, by implication, it's suggesting that if you oppose the War on
<br>
Drugs, you help terrorists.
<br>
<p>Well, we hate terrorists, too. In fact, we hate them so much we'd like
<br>
to squeeze their funding down to almost ZERO.
<br>
<p>We'd like to see the $40 million the U.S. government says the Taliban
<br>
raised from heroin dwindle down to a FEW PENNIES. We'd like to see the
<br>
$300 million that Colombian rebels raised from cocaine shrink down to a
<br>
HANDFUL OF PESOS.
<br>
<p>Can you imagine how destitute terrorists would be if marijuana sold for
<br>
the same price as lettuce? If poppies were worth the same as tulips?
<br>
And if cocaine-producing coca plants were no more valuable than
<br>
Brussels sprouts?
<br>
<p>If the War on Drugs did not artificially inflate their prices by
<br>
17,000%, that's exactly what would happen. And many terrorists would be
<br>
penniless.
<br>
<p>We Libertarians understand that. We know the War on Drugs gives
<br>
terrorists the money they use to kill Americans.
<br>
<p>But how do we get that message across?
<br>
<p>How do we reach the American people -- when those full-page ONDCP ads
<br>
are spreading lies and distortions?
<br>
<p>Then we had a brainstorm: We'll create our OWN ad.
<br>
<p>And that's what we did.
<br>
<p>At first glance, it looks just like the ONDCP ad.
<br>
<p>But in OUR ad, the face of Drug Czar John Walters is staring out.
<br>
<p>And OUR text says...
<br>
<p>&quot;This week, I had lunch with the President, testified before Congress,
<br>
and helped funnel $40 million in illegal drug money to groups like the
<br>
Taliban.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bang. We take the Drug Warriors' ad -- and throw it right back in their
<br>
faces.
<br>
<p>At the bottom, our ad says: &quot;The War on Drugs boosts the price of
<br>
illegal drugs by as much as 17,000% -- funneling huge profits to
<br>
terrorist organizations. If you support the War on Drugs or vote for
<br>
the politicians who wage it, you're helping support terrorism.&quot; We give
<br>
a website address for more information.
<br>
<p>Can you imagine John Walters' reaction when he sees our ad?
<br>
<p>Can you imagine the squawks of outrage from the Drug Warriors?
<br>
<p>The ad is ready to go. At the end of this message, I'll give you a link
<br>
so you can see it for yourself.
<br>
<p>We want to run it in two newspapers: USA Today and the Washington
<br>
Times.
<br>
<p>USA Today reaches 2.1 million people. It's the nation's most widely
<br>
read newspaper.
<br>
<p>The Washington Times has a circulation of only 105,000. But, as the
<br>
capital's &quot;conservative&quot; newspaper, it reaches EVERY Republican House
<br>
and Senate member.In fact, it's one of the six newspapers President
<br>
George W. Bush reads each day.
<br>
<p>Can you imagine President Bush's face when he sees our ad staring at
<br>
him from the pages of the Washington Times?
<br>
<p>When the ad runs, we'll shift into overdrive to try to leverage it into
<br>
ADDITIONAL news coverage.
<br>
<p>We'll fax copies of the ad to major media around the country. We'll
<br>
tell them: &quot;The Drug War Debate Is On!&quot;
<br>
<p>We'll challenge journalists to ask John Walters for a comment -- or to
<br>
debate us on talk shows.
<br>
<p>If we do it right, our ads could generate twice as much &quot;free&quot; media
<br>
coverage as they cost to run.
<br>
<p>But the ads won't be cheap. It will cost $60,350 to run it in USA
<br>
Today. And $9,450 for the Washington Times.
<br>
<p>That's a total of $69,800. We plan to run the ad next Tuesday, so we
<br>
can capitalize on the awareness of the original ads. That's the
<br>
quickest we can rush into print -- which means we need to raise the
<br>
money by this FRIDAY, so we can submit the ad to the newspapers for
<br>
approval. (They require a two-day notice.)
<br>
<p>Now, here's the best part of the plan.
<br>
<p>Newspapers must approve ads before they run. Our advertisement -- with
<br>
its in-your-face message and audacious take-off of the ONDCP ad -- may
<br>
get rejected by USA Today as &quot;too controversial.&quot;
<br>
<p>It may get rejected by the Washington Times because it's in direct
<br>
opposition to their pro-Drug War editorial stance.
<br>
<p>Great. We hope the ads get rejected.
<br>
<p>If they do, we have a chance to create a FIRESTORM of controversy.
<br>
<p>Remember the TV coverage Ralph Nader got when he ran a MasterCard spoof
<br>
ad during his presidential campaign -- and got sued by the credit card
<br>
company?
<br>
<p>Remember the media coverage PETA got when it ran billboards of nude
<br>
models with the caption: &quot;I'd rather go naked than wear fur&quot;?
<br>
<p>Remember the slew of articles that resulted when David Horowitz's ad
<br>
arguing against slavery reparations was rejected by several college
<br>
newspapers?
<br>
<p>We have a chance to do the same thing. We have an opportunity to get
<br>
pundits and columnists debating OUR ad.
<br>
<p>If our ad is rejected by either newspaper, we'll immediately get on the
<br>
phone to OTHER newspapers. (They love hearing about &quot;censorship&quot;
<br>
involving rival newspapers.)
<br>
<p>We'll blast a press release to the major TV networks, charging the two
<br>
newspapers with &quot;suppressing political dissent.&quot;
<br>
<p>We'll send a copy of the rejected ad to John Walters at the Office of
<br>
National Drug Control Policy -- and dare him to comment.
<br>
<p>If we can get Walters to take the bait -- and attack our ad or question
<br>
our arguments -- then the firestorm will begin.
<br>
<p>It will be the Libertarians versus the Drug Warriors.
<br>
<p>It could land us on national television -- since there's nothing the
<br>
media loves more than a good, juicy controversy.
<br>
<p>Then, we'll take the money we raised and try to run the ad in two other
<br>
major newspapers. And see if we can turn that into even more attention.
<br>
<p>Can we guarantee that we'll get mountains of media coverage? Of course
<br>
not. It depends on what other news is going on, what the ONDCP does,
<br>
and other factors beyond our control.
<br>
<p>But if we DON'T run the ad -- if we don't take chances -- we'll NEVER
<br>
get that kind of national coverage.
<br>
<p>If you don't swing for the fences, you won't hit a home run.
<br>
<p>This nervy ad could be OUR home run.
<br>
<p>But only if we raise $69,800 by Friday.
<br>
<p>If we raise the money, we'll submit the ads to USA Today and the
<br>
Washington Times, to run on Tuesday, February 26. (Not on Monday,
<br>
because Congress is off on Mondays.)
<br>
<p>If the newspapers AGREE to run it, we'll let you know. And we'll blast
<br>
out thousands of press releases promoting the ad on Tuesday morning.
<br>
<p>If the newspapers REJECT the ads, we'll let you know. And we'll blast
<br>
out thousands of press releases, promoting the controversy, as soon as
<br>
we hear their decision.
<br>

<br>
<p>EVERY PENNY we raise from this message will go to run the ad. We wrote,
<br>
designed, and produced the ad in-house, so there are no additional
<br>
fees.
<br>
<p>EVERY PENNY you donate will put our advertisement in front of 2.2
<br>
million Americans, and smack-dab in the faces of the Drug Warriors.
<br>
<p>EVERY PENNY you donate will send the message: The Drug War Debate Is
<br>
On!

<br>
<p>If everyone who gets this message donates just $10, we'll have more
<br>
than enough money to run the ad. Unfortunately, not everyone will. So,
<br>
could you contribute $50? Or $100? That will help cover the cost of
<br>
those who don't donate, and put us that much closer to the $69,800 we
<br>
need.
<br>
<p>In fact, since this ad doesn't involve federal candidates, there are no
<br>
contribution limits. You can legally donate any amount you want.
<br>
<p>We don't want to pressure you. Look at the ad again. Think about what
<br>
it's worth to you to be able to buy a copy of USA Today next Tuesday
<br>
and see YOUR ad. Then, donate whatever you think is appropriate.
<br>
<p>This is our chance to strike back. To raise the blood pressure of
<br>
America's most bullheaded Drug Warriors. And to get our message out to
<br>
2.2 million Americans.
<br>
<p>You can help. Just click here to donate:

<br>
<p>Thank you,
<br>
<p>Ron Crickenberger, Libertarian Party Political Director
<br>
<p>PS: Remember, if we raise the money, you'll see the ad in USA Today
<br>
next Tuesday, February 26.
<br>
<p>You'll see the SAME ad in the SAME newspaper that will land with a thud
<br>
in the White House and in the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
<br>
<p>Or, the newspapers may REJECT our ad. In which case, we'll work hard to
<br>
turn it into a national controversy that generates news articles, talk
<br>
radio debate, and perhaps even national TV coverage.
<br>
<p>Either way, your support will make it happen. EVERY dollar you
<br>
contribute goes directly to pay for the ads. Just click here:

<br>
<p>P.P.S. Please pass this message on to friends, family members, and
<br>
other people you know personally who might be interested, but please

don't send it indiscriminately -- spam will only hurt our campaign.
