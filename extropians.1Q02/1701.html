<p><p>Of course, once you have a life insurance contract you might as well sign up

would be a shame to die and not take advantage of whatever chances you have

with current technology.

<p>### I am surprised - the insurance contract which I am arranging now will
<br>
cost me about 90$ per year. This is much less than Alcor membership. Should
<br>
I pay more for insurance?
