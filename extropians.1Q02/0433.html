I thought I'd stamped out the improper thinking on this list
<br>
with regard to aging, but I guess there is still some meme-tweeking
<br>
to be done. ... :-)

<p><em>&gt; ... discussed his findings that cancer cells were not subject to

<p>I doubt those were new findings in 1980.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... recall thinking, &quot;Ah, and that's because the Hayflick limit is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural brake on cancer, and why childhood cancers are so deadly.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>The first conclusion is correct.  The Hayflick limit, due in part,
<br>
perhaps primarily, to telomere shortening, is an an anti-cancer
<br>
program.  Childhood cancers are deadly because they generally
<br>
involve really severe mutations that promote cell division.
<br>
It isn't clear whether in the cells of children the telomeres
<br>
might be longer, allowng for more replication, before one has
<br>
to perform the telomerase activation mutation(s) to continue
<br>
dividing.  Many childhood cancers involve the cells of the
<br>
immune system (leukemias, etc.).  I'm unaware of *any* literature
<br>
that says the telomeres of immune system cells are longer in
<br>
children than in adults.  (Its not completely implausible, I'm
<br>
just unaware of any evidence.)  A completely alternate explanation
<br>
could explain this -- that in children your immune system isn't
<br>
sufficiently well trained in &quot;self&quot;-recognition that it is
<br>
properly able to instruct cancerous cells to commit apoptosis.
<br>
Cancers in children may run amok because the opposing forces
<br>
are too naive to eliminate them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason that this kind of idea has taken so long to reach the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forefront of research consciousness is that so many of the major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers were locked into the idea that there could not be such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing as genetically programmed lifespan, as most individuals never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get very close to death from senesense anyway.
</em><br>
<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;genetically programmed lifespan&quot;.
<br>
There *is* such a thing as aging as a result of side effects
<br>
from incomplete or self-destructive programming.  Antagonistic
<br>
plieotropy is self-destructive programming and it is reasonable
<br>
to consider the Hayflick limit an example of that.  The program
<br>
limits cell division to limit the instantiations of cancer and
<br>
as a result may impose limits on the availability of stem cells
<br>
to perform tissue repair.  It is worth noting that telomerase
<br>
is *on* in some cells in the human body and so aging may in
<br>
part be a result of a faulure to properly tune the level of
<br>
telomerase activity in various cell types.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They pass on their genes while still young, so there's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary selection against aging.
</em><br>
<p>This is somewhat different from antagonistic plieotropy.  This
<br>
is generally called &quot;the declining force of natural selection&quot;.
<br>
Both &quot;antagonistic plieotropy&quot; and &quot;declining force of natural
<br>
selection&quot; can result in programs that produce &quot;aging&quot;.  It has
<br>
yet to be determined the extent to which each of these operate in
<br>
various species.
<br>
<p>I'd consider the death of salmon after swimming upstream to
<br>
mate an example of antagonistic plieotropy -- their systems
<br>
get dosed in glucocorticoids to drive them forward and in the
<br>
end this causes the failure of several organ systems.  The
<br>
program is designed to allow for successful reproduction --
<br>
death is just a side effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The opposing argument, as propounded by W. Donner Denkla, was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species require a genetic turnover in order to shift to adapt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing environments.  If the turnover rate is too low, the species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes extinct.
</em><br>
<p>I know of no evidence for this in any species.  I suspect you
<br>
would have to look for environments where there are chaotic
<br>
shifts in environmental conditions.  Mind you there is a related
<br>
genetic program in bacteria -- they don't change their replication
<br>
rate -- instead they change their inherent mutation rate.  Some
<br>
bacteria have an &quot;SOS response&quot; gene set that cause their DNA
<br>
replication to get very sloppy.  &quot;Genetic turnover&quot; doesn't do
<br>
any good unless it produces program variants more likely to survive.
<br>
<p>| Re: an example of a population with genes for optimal replication at
<br>
| different temperatures
<br>
<p>This looks like you are arguing for &quot;group selection&quot; for maintaining
<br>
an abundance of genes within a population.  I've made a similar argument
<br>
on the list with regard to &quot;novelty-seeking&quot; or &quot;risk-taking&quot; behaviors
<br>
to explain migration to the United States.  I also believe this situation
<br>
explains the store vs. burn calories phenotypes that produce various
<br>
body types (driven by the need to store energy reserves to survive
<br>
winters vs. being fast on your feet and a good hunter in the summer).
<br>
<p>But ultimately rather than maintain the genes as polymorphisms within
<br>
a population it would be better to duplicate them and put them under
<br>
different regulatory control within the same individual.  Then the
<br>
genetic program of the individual can be more adaptive to the environment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer I always got to this line of argument, from the LE gurus of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 60's &amp; 70's was that evolution only selected via individuals
</em><br>
<p>Yes, one constantly has to place an emphasis on this.  There have been
<br>
some examples for &quot;kin selection&quot; demonstrated -- there might even
<br>
be a rare argument for &quot;group selection&quot; (the really smart monkey
<br>
that figures out how to sift the rice from the sand which is quickly
<br>
copied by other group members) -- but the selection pressure that
<br>
results from these is *very* weak compared to individual selection
<br>
pressure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;(Damien Broderick cites a recent paper indicating p53 protects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; against tumors in mice at the cost of speeding aging) 
</em><br>
<p>!##$&amp;*#!  *GO* back to the primary sources.  That *isn't* what the
<br>
paper said.  The paper said mice with 1 copy of a strangely mutated
<br>
p53 gene had reduced cancer and accelerated aging.  Extrapolating
<br>
from this is skating on very thin ice.

<em>&gt; I don't think it's gloomy news. Basic population biology indicates aging 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either serves some purpose useful for the aging individual or it's really, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really hard to fix.
</em><br>
<p>(Byegones if this is misatributed).
<br>
<p>There is no demonstration from population biology that aging itself
<br>
serves a &quot;general&quot; useful purpose.  There is a relatively &quot;common&quot; belief
<br>
that to my knowledge has no scientific basis.  (I.e. its urban legend).
<br>
<p>Aging serving a useful purpose for an *individual* is &quot;antagonistic
<br>
plieotropy&quot; -- there does appear to be some evidence for this.
<br>
<p>Aging is &quot;hard&quot; to fix in the sense that requires the evolution
<br>
of sophisticated programs and &quot;evolution&quot; isn't &quot;intelligent&quot;.
<br>
It would appear however once scientists dissect out the causes
<br>
of aging that developing programs to prevent those isn't particularly
<br>
difficult.  To prevent cancer one needs more error correction
<br>
and verification systems to accurately preserve the genome over
<br>
longer periods.  To prevent aging due to mutations in the mitochondrial
<br>
genome one needs to complete the job nature has been doing in humans
<br>
and move the mitochondiral genes into the nucleus (away from free
<br>
radical damage) or add a program that allows the more robust DNA
<br>
repair that occurs in the nucleus to be functioning in the mitochondria
<br>
as well.  Etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; To really fix aging,  we must step outside of the box with cyborgization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or cell line replacement (either in vivo or ex vivo via organ replacement).
</em><br>
<p>No argument -- this will likely be a part of the eventual solution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, we may be able to manipulate related systems in people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve quality or quantity of life in individual people.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.  That is in part what extropianism is all about.
