<em>&gt; &gt;A few people have noted this as well.  I can only get it working in one of

<em>&gt; &gt;insight into how it works inside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which browser is it working in for you? I use Opera, and the message
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it gave me said to download a new version of Netscape if you see the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It started for me in Mozilla for Linux, but the layout is rather crammed
<br>
to the extent of having a zero-width input field. Also, I'm not quite sure
<br>
if it ever got connected, since the CS department has a rather picky
<br>
firewall. It actually seems from the chat documentation that they're not
<br>
really motivated to make it work anywhere except Windows, which kind of
<br>
makes it not an option for me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I used to be much more active on IRC.  The problem is that it doesn't spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;across all servers very well.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; That's true. But we could still set up a channel that would be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official ExI chan. List it on the Yahoo site and maybe even the ExI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homepage, saying &quot;This is where you go if you want to chat!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, just spesify an IRC network along with the channel. I could suggest
<br>
DALNet even though I don't use it myself currently, because it seems to
<br>
have servers with few access restrictions in the US and EU and some other
<br>
places. EFNet and IRCNet are generally more geographically confined,
<br>
though there are probably some servers that would allow cross-continent
<br>
participants. In case of using one of them it'd probably be nice to list
<br>
some of such generous servers as well.
