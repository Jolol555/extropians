<p>Of course not, but presuming that they are more like europeans than
<br>
other humans is the absolute height of ethnocentricity. The fact that we
<br>
have no evidence that they DO exist means that your presumption is based
<br>
on absolutely no facts at all.
<br>
<p>While it is quite acceptable to presume that, based on us being the only
<br>
current datapoint, other spacefaring technological civilizations we may
<br>
find are at least as likely to be more like us than less, the current
<br>
dominance of euro-derived cultures (specifically anglospheric culture)
<br>
on earth is preternaturally based on the state of events at this
<br>
particular point in time, and has absolutely nothing to do with how an
<br>
alien culture would have developed on a very different world, with
<br>
different climate, geography, resource distributions and ecological
<br>
evolution of various species.
<br>
<p>Given trends into the future, it is as likely that they are more like
<br>
Chinese, if you are going to use that criteria.
<br>
<p>I highly recommend Jared Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; to anyone
<br>
trying to make any prognostications about what alien life and culture
<br>
will be like. What cultures develop at what pace is highly dependent
<br>
upon the species they co-evolve with and the geography and climate they
<br>
develop in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there is currently no detectable evidence of extra terrestrial intelligence. but in the dark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ages, there was no detectable evidence of, say, quarks, or that the earth was not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; center of the universe, or that a box the size of a big man's torso could calculate more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex equations and find more really really big prime numbers than any human could.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that doesn't physically disprove any of those things.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there was evidence in spades of quarks, of a sol-centric
<br>
planetary system, and that the earth was not the center of the universe,
<br>
they only required that people observe that evidence and draw the proper
<br>
logical conclusions from them using the scientific method and not
<br>
superstition. Furthermore mechanical calculators for calculating time
<br>
and astronomical movement have been found dating back to ancient greece,
<br>
and accurate predictions of lunar eclipses, comets, and planetary
<br>
movement for thousands of years have been performed. 
<br>
<p>That the ignorant superstitious types choose to refuse to acknowledge
<br>
existence of evidence is quite different from its actual absence.
