<em>&gt; Do you play computer games?
</em><br>
<p>Yup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you do please tell me what kind of,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have played Warcraft, which is fun from the POV of managing and
<br>
growing a whole community, managing limited resources (and then going
<br>
and using it to clobber the Orcs with it). Quake and Duke Nukem are fun
<br>
from a first person shooters, and Mission Impossible is similarly fun.
<br>
<p>I am currently playing with X-Plane, a flight simulator which allows you
<br>
to download different planes off the web, as well as allowing the user
<br>
to design their own aircraft. I just finished designing a sim of XCOR's
<br>
EZ-Rocket, and am working on designing various air-to-air missiles as
<br>
well as bombs of various models for a hoped for combat plug-in to the
<br>
sim. I'm also designing a V-1 buzzbomb (Fiesler FI-103) in it as well as
<br>
the manned variant, the FI-103 R-IV Reichenberg, in X-Plane's
<br>
Plane-Maker. X-Plane also allows you to design and fly aircraft on the
<br>
planet Mars, as well as fly re-entry maneuvers with the Space Shuttle.
<br>
You can build spacecraft in X-Plane and fly them in space, since it
<br>
treats planets as globes and not planar environments like most sims do.
<br>
<p>Because of this do-it-yourself design capability, and the interplanetary
<br>
capabilities as well, I consider X-Plane to be the creme de la creme of
<br>
extropic video games.
<br>
<p>The game I use the most is Freecell, waiting for pesky websites to load.
<br>
My win average with it is about 63% playing at breakneck speed.
