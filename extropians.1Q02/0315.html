<p>
m;orrey expounded:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Actually, the error of Heinlein and his contemporaries was assuming that
<br>
the extreme change would be in the world of transportation rather than
<br>
information. Not that there wasn't a revolution in transportation as
<br>
well. Keep in mind that in 1946, air transportation was limited to
<br>
government officials and the wealthy, and the quality of transportation
<br>
was rough, slow, and uncomfortable. Civil transports flew at 200-300
<br>
mph, usually unpressurized and with poor heating and high incidence of
<br>
turbulence with small planes. Man still had not penetrated the sound
<br>
barrier, the fastest military planes still flew under 600 mph.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I love the computer telcom rapid evolution we are experiencing, just love it 
<br>
as most twits do.  But I bet that comparatively rapid advances in 
<br>
transportation (unit per unit), would have fit the dreams of the future that 
<br>
many of us had.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;What Heinlein and his contemporaries failed to forecast was the enormous
<br>
economic drain that both the Cold War AND the 'War on Poverty' would
<br>
have, how this negatively impacted the level of investment in space
<br>
exploration following the Apollo era, and how the loss in Vietnam would
<br>
impact the national self-confidence for so long, and he did not, in
<br>
1946, forecast the sort of market manipulation the OPEC cartel could use
<br>
to cripple the world economy for years.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think I agree with your reasoning, concerninh how political trends 
<br>
mitigated accelerated progress in spaceflight, and global transport systems.  
<br>
However, there may be something about how the physics of the world raises the 
<br>
bar, for technical achiveability (if such a phrase exists) so that progress 
<br>
is s-l-o-w. In other words  many advances are possible, but less so for 
<br>
technical progress that is affordable, and reliable.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I personally expect us to catch up to and exceed Heinlein's predictions
<br>
within a few decades. You must keep in mind that his idea of 'massive
<br>
change' is certainly not what you or I would consider such. He was born
<br>
in 1910, the same year as my grandfather. I'd hardly expect someone of
<br>
that era to look at our current day and not see our 'normality' as
<br>
representing &quot;The Crazy Years&quot;. My 89 year old grandmother certainly
<br>
sees these days as such.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well said, but I feel Heinlein's Crazy Years never happened, or not, at 
<br>
least, on a scientifically inspired basis. Heinlein was also given to making 
<br>
enchanting, extraordinary statements, without extraordinary evidence to 
<br>
sustain such statements. But lets face it, his primary target audience was 
<br>
probably thrilled to discuss things in a serious manner, during America's 
<br>
&quot;wonder years&quot; of the 40's, 50's, &amp; 60's.
