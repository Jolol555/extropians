OK, I have waited a bit with my comments, because I have been
<br>
awfully busy, and also interested in seeing what kinds of
<br>
comments would appear. 
<br>
<p>First, I think James has written an important paper. Not that I
<br>
agree with it or its conclusions, but in that it is an attempt to
<br>
start a transhumanist ideological discourse on a higher formal
<br>
level. We need that to develop ideologically, since it both
<br>
provides documents that can later be more easily referred to and
<br>
commented upon, and that it requires a broader view than just the
<br>
current thread on the mailing list. 
<br>
<p>My comments got a bit (!) longer than I intended, so I will
<br>
divide this mail into a number of sections. An abstract:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I describe the roots of transhumanism in renaissance and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enlightenment humanism, and discuss its relationship with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collectivist &quot;transhumanism&quot; in the 20s and 30s. I also discuss
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my own experience of how the transhumanist environment has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developed during the 90s. I then argue that transhumanism is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an ideologically empty idea, but that inherent in it are strong
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humanist values that resonate well with both libertarianism and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liberal democracy. These values are however not consistent with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collectivism or fascism, and not tied to technology per se.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I discuss the need for transhumanism as a movement to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify its core ideology and begin developing it.  
<br>
<p>Contents
<br>
<p>1. 	The roots of transhumanism
<br>
2. 	What is transhumanism really about?
<br>
2.1 	Transhumanism across the 90's
<br>
2.2 	Core values of transhumanism
<br>
2.3 	Critique of collectivist transhumanism
<br>
2.4 	What ideologies are compatible with transhumanism?
<br>
2.5 	The problem with a technology identified transhumanism
<br>
3. 	What should transhumanism as a movement strive towards?
<br>
<p><p>1. The roots of transhumanism
<br>
<p>James' paper claims that contemporary transhumanism is based in
<br>
anarcho-capitalist thought. I would say, given some views
<br>
expressed on this list and encountered in society, that one could
<br>
just as well claim it has technocrat communist roots. In fact, it
<br>
is likely more important to get away from those roots than the
<br>
libertarian ones.
<br>
<p>The paper begins with the history of ExI, and this produces the
<br>
impression that ExI really *is* modern transhumanism. While the
<br>
influence of Max, Natasha, T.O. Morrow and all the other founders
<br>
and thinkers linked to ExI is beyond doubt, they did not start
<br>
out in a vacuum with their ideas. Later in the paper FM 2030 is
<br>
acknowledged, and further back even more remote historical
<br>
sources. I think this approach creates the mistaken impression
<br>
that transhumanism is something very recent and with shallow
<br>
roots.
<br>
<p>But the true origin of transhumanism can be traced back to the
<br>
renaissance humanists. Mirandola's triumphant _Oration on the
<br>
Dignity of Man_ expresses the transhumanist project admirably:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``We have given you, O Adam, no visage proper to yourself, nor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endowment properly your own, in order that whatever place,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever form, whatever gifts you may, with premeditation,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select, these same you may have and possess through your own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgement and decision. The nature of all other creatures is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defined and restricted within laws which We have laid down; you,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by contrast, impeded by no such restrictions, may, by your own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free will, to whose custody We have assigned you, trace for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yourself the lineaments of your own nature. I have placed you at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the very center of the world, so that from that vantage point
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you may with greater ease glance round about you on all that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world contains. We have made you a creature neither of heaven
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, in order that you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may, as the free and proud shaper of your own being, fashion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yourself in the form you may prefer. It will be in your power to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;descend to the lower, brutish forms of life; you will be able,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through your own decision, to rise again to the superior orders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose life is divine.'' 
<br>
<p>While the renaissance humanists were more concerned with issues
<br>
of human freedom and dignity than the possibility of immortality
<br>
or morphological freedom, there is no contradiction here and as
<br>
Brian Manning Delaney pointed out at TransVision 2001 they would
<br>
likely have embraced it. They in turn drew on the Aristotelian
<br>
ideas of eudaimonia, the life of excellence.  
<br>
<p>After the renaissance these ideas of human freedom, potential and
<br>
dignity became central for the enlightenment. Technological
<br>
progress was still mainly seen as separate from (but helpful to)
<br>
human progress, although early ideas of technological enhancement
<br>
of the human condition per se are suggested in the writings of
<br>
Benjamin Franklin and Condorcet. Many of the enlightenment ideas
<br>
are today so integral to liberal democracy that they are not even
<br>
recognized as being non-trivial and based on a certain
<br>
perspective on humanity (except possibly when challenged by
<br>
theocrats and conservatives, who have different views of what
<br>
constitutes a human being and the good life). When extropians are
<br>
called libertarians and anarcho-capitalists, it often turns out
<br>
that the issue is often their defense of enlightenment ideas in
<br>
opposition to later romantic and especially collectivist ideas. 
<br>
<p>The first real &quot;transhumanist&quot; vision (n.b. that I will call it
<br>
transhumanist here for simplicity, although I will in the next
<br>
section show that it is not a correct denotation) that clearly
<br>
included technological enhancement of the human condition was
<br>
stated by (as James points out) H.G. Wells, and followed by the
<br>
influential writings of J.B.S. Haldane and J.D. Bernal in the
<br>
20's and 30's. Now the ideas of life extension (as science, not
<br>
magic), cyborgisation, a future in space, posthumans, enhanced
<br>
intelligence - and of course eugenics - appear at full strength.
<br>
There is no coincidence that the above people were socialists -
<br>
as Bernal put it, &quot;a good scientist is a communist&quot;: Marxism was
<br>
regarded as science, and a correct model of how the world worked
<br>
would need to include it. Science, society, progress and moral
<br>
righteousness were not separate things but a whole. This view was
<br>
prevalent even among non-socialists: it was the age of the
<br>
engineered or managed society, where both the left and right
<br>
envisioned a controlled society as the best possible solution. 
<br>
<p>It is important to note the collectivist emphasis here: the goal
<br>
was not to create a better life for individual humans but for all
<br>
of humanity - the collective, rather than the individual (&quot;the
<br>
individual is only a function of the collective&quot;, as Marx put
<br>
it). The profound influence of collectivism in this period cannot
<br>
be overstated, regardless of it being Marxist class collectivism,
<br>
Nazist race collectivism or nationalist collectivism. It is no
<br>
coincidence that Stapledon describes his posthuman and advanced
<br>
alien civilizations as communist or fascist states, with global
<br>
consciousness as the supreme goal. 
<br>
<p>WWII devastated the collectivist form of &quot;transhumanism&quot; by its
<br>
association to nazism and fascism, as well as the absorption of
<br>
the socialists into the east-west dialectics. The stagnation of
<br>
technological development in the east - especially in the
<br>
biosciences - moved the idea of human enhancement into the mists
<br>
of social conditioning and dialectical evolution, i.e. back to
<br>
the old idea that the only changes necessary or possible were due
<br>
to social and mental factors. 
<br>
<p>The ideas of technological enhancement in the west instead took
<br>
the route through science fiction and the pro-science subcultures
<br>
that emerged during the space race, where they eventually
<br>
stimulated thinkers like FM 2030 and Max More. Note that this
<br>
postwar period also largely separated them from the social ideas
<br>
before - the enlightenment ideas were largely taken for granted
<br>
since they were embodied in the surrounding (American) society
<br>
and the idea of a unity between science and progressive ethics
<br>
was lost in the gulf between the two cultures of the humanities
<br>
and the natural sciences (especially since the humanities came to
<br>
drift in a somewhat more leftist direction).

</em><br>
<p>I feel it ironic that James began his essay by quoting me about
<br>
this. I have indeed argued in the past that transhumanism in its
<br>
pure form as rational radical improvement of the human condition
<br>
is largely independent from political ideology. But I have also
<br>
changed my opinion greatly on this since 1994 when the quoted
<br>
text was written.
<br>
<p>The problem here is the definition of transhumanism, and what
<br>
goals it is assumed to aim for.
<br>
<p><p>2.1 Transhumanism across the 90's
<br>
<p>I think a digression about my own ideological development may be
<br>
in place here, because I also think it shows a change in
<br>
transhumanist thought. 
<br>
<p>When I started out thinking along transhumanist lines, I took a
<br>
wholly technocentric view. The goal was to maximize the
<br>
information content or complexity of the universe; to achieve
<br>
this certain steps of technological development were necessary
<br>
(such as space colonization and AI), and to make these possible
<br>
other developments, including political, economical and social
<br>
ones, were necessary subgoals. Society and to some extent the
<br>
individual were secondary to a grandiose technological
<br>
imperative.
<br>
<p>As time went on, I realized that these sub-goals were in fact
<br>
important. A transhumanism that did not care for the individual
<br>
or the real, current world other than as a stepping stone would
<br>
never truly motivate anyone, get anywhere or if it did, become a
<br>
kind of techno-fascism I found distasteful. Instead I began to
<br>
focus on methods of self-transformation, the issue of how humans
<br>
- real, individual humans - could become better in different
<br>
ways. I did not concentrate on collectives since I knew that
<br>
people are unique, have different goals and opportunities.
<br>
However, I was still largely seeing the whole issue as one of
<br>
technology - softer technologies like mental training and
<br>
biotechnology, but still a process driven by technology. I also
<br>
did not care for ideology; having grown up as an apolitical
<br>
person and with a serious distaste for collective dogmas I viewed
<br>
it as a nuisance. Openness and tolerance appeared a far better
<br>
way of maximizing the diversity and impact of transhumanism. This
<br>
attitude was also mirrored quite widely: instead of closed
<br>
mailing lists where agreement with fundamental tenets was assumed
<br>
the lists were opened or other, open forums appeared. In Aleph,
<br>
we explicitly pronounced ourselves non-ideological and open to
<br>
all transhumanists. 
<br>
<p>This was the position I had in 1994 when I wrote the quoted text:
<br>
transhumanism would, through its inherent positive technological
<br>
effects, not need any specific ideological position other than
<br>
those necessary to bring about the effects. In a way it was a
<br>
mirror of utopian socialist idea that as technology marched on
<br>
everybody would become socialists. 
<br>
<p>But the story does not end there. The more I interacted with
<br>
people inside and outside transhumanism and learned about the
<br>
history of ideas and technology, the more I realized that
<br>
*politics does matter*. Philosophy matters. Technology doesn't
<br>
solely drive social and cultural changes, quite often they
<br>
instead drive technological development. Without any values to
<br>
motivate and direct transhumanism it would not get anywhere, and
<br>
quite likely become hijacked by other groups. Even more, not all
<br>
interpretations of transhumanism were meaningful - quite a few
<br>
were simply transhumanist ideas of technological transformation
<br>
arbitrarily tacked onto political views with no attempts as
<br>
consistency. As the breadth of transhumanism increased, it also
<br>
became shallower. In the ever more noisy list environments any
<br>
discussion that did not keep to strictly defined engineering
<br>
matters and instead moved into issues related to ideology and
<br>
current day policy would be embroiled in a low-quality discourse
<br>
where most participants lacked significant knowledge and instead
<br>
let their opinions play freely. 
<br>
<p>I more and more felt that transhumanism as a term had lost any
<br>
meaning if it could denote both someone advocating a centralist
<br>
socialist economy, someone advocating anarcho-capitalism and
<br>
someone advocating mystical contemplation as long as they all
<br>
thought nanotechnology was great. Transhumanism seemed to be
<br>
nothing but technophilia or even just awareness of radical
<br>
technology as a possible future option (which was a definition
<br>
that circulated briefly during the work on the Transhumanist
<br>
Principles - according to that definition Jeremy Rifkin would
<br>
have been a transhumanist! That observation of course quickly led
<br>
to an amendment of the definition). 
<br>
<p>Over the last years I have come to the conclusion that we need to
<br>
rethink the core values of transhumanism, or rather, define the
<br>
core values. The problem is that the term transhumanism is by now
<br>
so diluted that it hardly means anything, and that there hardly
<br>
exists any standards body that can claim &quot;ownership&quot; of the term
<br>
or its official definition - WTA might be the closest thing, but
<br>
we shouldn't overestimate the impact of such pronouncements. 
<br>
<p><p>2.2 Core values of transhumanism
<br>
<p>Is there any core values of transhumanism? Note that the
<br>
definition of transhumanism as &quot;rational radical enhancements of
<br>
the human condition&quot; does contain an assumption that there has to
<br>
be some underlying values being furthered - something is enhanced
<br>
relative its past state. It also implies some concept of human
<br>
condition (and of what is rational and radical, but I'll leave
<br>
those for another post). 
<br>
<p>Where does these values come from? Either they are inherent in
<br>
transhumanism, or they come from other assumed value systems such
<br>
as political ideologies hooked on to transhumanism as some kind
<br>
of external motivating engine. 
<br>
<p>But in the later case it seems pointless to discuss transhumanism
<br>
at all, since the issue would rather be &quot;How should we socialists
<br>
work to bring about the nanotechnology revolution&quot; -
<br>
transhumanism would simply be a part of the big program of the
<br>
ideology than anything independent of the ideology. In this case
<br>
the transhumanist forums would be just meeting places of people
<br>
of different politics sharing a few goals, just as there are
<br>
non-political forums of peace, environmentalism or furthering the
<br>
humanities. If this is true, then transhumanism is nothing more
<br>
than a shared issue.
<br>
<p>But this is contradicted by the history and scope of
<br>
transhumanism, the amount of interest that has been focused on
<br>
problematizing the human condition, examining the consequences of
<br>
human enhancement and its relationship to the world. I would
<br>
argue that transhumanism is in fact - or should be - seen as an
<br>
ideology on its own.
<br>
<p>If we look back at the roots of the idea, we see that - with the
<br>
exception of the pre WW II collectivist &quot;transhumanists&quot; - there
<br>
were strong underlying assumptions about what it means to be a
<br>
human and what the goal of a human life ought to be. The human
<br>
concept is the humanist one, with an independent yet social human
<br>
seeking individual self realization. If this humanist conception
<br>
of human and the individual good is extended (mutatis mutandis)
<br>
to current technological visions we get essentially the
<br>
&quot;mainstream&quot; transhumanist view (here in a somewhat abridged
<br>
form):
<br>
<p>Humans have an inherent value in themselves, a human dignity that
<br>
must be respected. They are uniquely individual, yet social
<br>
beings. They have different goals, ambitions and abilities, but
<br>
in general they achieve happiness and fulfillment by striving to
<br>
excel along their freely chosen directions. There are many
<br>
different tools and methods that can support this striving for
<br>
individual excellence, including help or interaction with others
<br>
as well as technology. The goal should be to develop oneself to
<br>
one's fullest potential.
<br>
<p>These humanist values and ideas embodied here are in my opinion
<br>
core values and ideas of transhumanism, and not just something
<br>
externally added on. A movement might advocate technological
<br>
transformation, but unless it is based in humanism, it cannot
<br>
honestly call itself transhumanism or any other title including
<br>
humanism. It would be just as semantically incorrect for people
<br>
disagreeing with Marx to call themselves Marxists (it might of
<br>
course be politically expedient, but for the moment we are
<br>
looking at the definitions of core ideas rather than how they
<br>
best can be implemented).
<br>
<p>Liberal democracy is also built on much of this humanist concept.
<br>
It is founded on the idea of the rights of individuals, rights
<br>
which in the end are traced back to the properties and goods of
<br>
humans and the desire to further the individual good. What
<br>
distinguishes liberal democracy from collectivism is that the
<br>
well-being of the existing individuals is the goal rather than
<br>
the well-being of an abstract class, and that their rights are
<br>
valid even when they interfere with the desires of the majority.
<br>
There does not exist any contradiction between the transhumanist
<br>
core values I have suggested above and liberal democracy. 
<br>
<p>Also, there is no contradiction here with a libertarian stance,
<br>
since it is based on the same respect for human rights. The
<br>
difference between a radical anarcho-capitalist and a liberal
<br>
democrat lies mainly in the emphasis and relative ranking of
<br>
certain rights, general views on how society should be organized
<br>
and - usually the controversial part - what level of coerciveness
<br>
is acceptable. While this tends to lead to loud and long-winded
<br>
debates here and elsewhere (and in practice of course deals with
<br>
extremely important social issues), it is imperative to recognize
<br>
that both parts (and the whole spectrum between them) have more
<br>
in common with each other than with the groups with a
<br>
non-humanist perspective. 
<br>
<p><p><p>2.3 Critique of collectivist transhumanism
<br>
<p>I have already criticized how collectivist perspectives place
<br>
abstractions such as humanity, the race or the collective above
<br>
the existing humans, and not just treat them as theoretical
<br>
primaries but also the beneficiaries of the good society. This
<br>
perspective makes humans mere tools to support abstractions.
<br>
<p>Many collectivists would however protest against this, since they
<br>
claim their aim is truly to help the existing people en masse.
<br>
But it is unlikely any approach that attempts to externally
<br>
impose the good on people or bases this interaction on a
<br>
collective view of people will be successful, at least not if one
<br>
has a humanistic view of what it means to be a human.
<br>
<p>The good life is not universal. We are all unique, with different
<br>
background, predilections and opportunities - my ideal life is
<br>
utterly different from your ideal life, even if they may share
<br>
some or many elements. The individual usually knows best what is
<br>
good for him or her, so most systems that attempt to centrally
<br>
bring about the good to everyone will in fact usually not supply
<br>
it at all. But even if some system could know what the best
<br>
possible life is for every person, it could not force them to
<br>
live it. It is impossible to force somebody to be rational, since
<br>
rationality is a volitional state and cannot be activated by
<br>
somebody else's coercion (at best it is activated to deal with
<br>
the coercion attempt). That a human changes their life situation
<br>
has to be based on knowledge about the situation and why it can
<br>
become better, as well as their own will to change it. To impose
<br>
a decision on somebody, even if it is a good one, is not a way to
<br>
get them to understand their situation and begin a better life.
<br>
In fact, it treats them as a lifeless object and makes them
<br>
dependent upon others.
<br>
<p>Even when certain things may have been good for us if we had
<br>
chosen them on our own, they may not be good for us when they are
<br>
imposed from the outside. In this case we are being reduced to an
<br>
externally controlled robot, and we lose an important aspect of
<br>
our humanity, our agency. Agency is necessary for living a good
<br>
life since we need to be able to take responsibility for our own
<br>
actions (and this responsibility vanishes when somebody else
<br>
controls our actions) and to develop our full potential - it is
<br>
the active life that is the good life. Without agency we cannot
<br>
grow, we can at best be shown how a good life might have appeared
<br>
from the outside but we do not experience it.
<br>
<p>A good life is not anything we create for others, because it is
<br>
not possible to give another human prestations, achievements,
<br>
happiness, self-realization or self-worth. They can only be
<br>
created from inside through moral, character, willpower and
<br>
integrity.
<br>
<p>Freedom may not be a sufficient condition for living a good life,
<br>
but it is a necessary condition.
<br>
<p><p>2.4 What ideologies are compatible with transhumanism?
<br>
<p>If transhumanism is to be interpreted as driven by humanist
<br>
values rather than any imported value system, then it is clear
<br>
that not all political aims or ideologies are compatible with it.
<br>
As I have argued above, the basic humanist vision is compatible
<br>
with both libertarian rights-based views and not too coercive
<br>
liberal democracy, and it is incompatible with most forms of
<br>
collectivism. If we now turn to the examples of fascist
<br>
transhumanism brought up by James, we can apply the same
<br>
analysis.
<br>
<p>The Prometheans are calling for loyalty to and sacrifice for an
<br>
eugenic super-race.  There does not appear to be any real concern
<br>
for achieving human happiness or individual excellence, all is
<br>
subordinate to the survival of the race.  This is a good example
<br>
of collectivism at its worst, and obviously has nothing to do
<br>
with any form of humanism. Hence it cannot be regarded as
<br>
transhumanism.
<br>
<p>The debate about the removal of the Xenith site is otherwise a
<br>
good example of why a better definition of transhumanist core
<br>
values is necessary. The problem was the lack of consensus or
<br>
official position on what is and isn't transhumanism rather than
<br>
a sizeable support for the ideas. With a better awareness of the
<br>
ideology inherent in the term transhumanism the issue would have
<br>
been far easier to resolve.
<br>
<p>A group that was not dealt with much in James' text is mystical
<br>
transhumanism. Although some of the millennialist aspects of the
<br>
Singularity concept were mentioned, a far more common thread is
<br>
the tendency towards &quot;cybergnosticism&quot; that Mark Dery derided and
<br>
the intoxication with cosmic perspectives that combine
<br>
transhumanist trappings with what is essentially a pre-rational
<br>
world of Powers, grand evolution towards the highest and personal
<br>
transcendence. By its openness the transhumanist movement has
<br>
acquired a sizeable contingent of people who are more interested
<br>
in the mystical overtones than the practical reality. 
<br>
<p>Mystical transhumanism fails through its irrationality; most
<br>
adherents are not seeking to actually become posthuman through
<br>
their own efforts, but rather to achieve it thanks to the mercy
<br>
of posthuman deities. While this passivity is not per se against
<br>
humanism, it seems that it does not produce any incitement
<br>
towards personal excellence in most of its adherents. If one adds
<br>
the rationality aspect of transhumanism to the definition,
<br>
mystical transhumanism is not transhumanism in the same way as
<br>
laying on the sofa waiting for the revolution of the proletariat
<br>
to provide for one is not a correct interpretation of socialism. 
<br>
<p>The concepts of radical democratic transhumanism mentioned cover
<br>
a broad range, from specific issues like Haraway's cyborg
<br>
feminism over welfare reforms like guaranteed income to utopian
<br>
(nano)socialism and Ken MacLeod's pro-dynamist skepticism of both
<br>
the traditional and non-traditional left *and* right. It is not
<br>
clear what the connecting thread is, except that they are not
<br>
part of the libertarian perspective (which is doubtful in the
<br>
case of Ken MacLeod) or the strongly collectivist perspective
<br>
(which is doubtful in the case of Singer). It does not appear
<br>
that a political program or society could incorporate all or even
<br>
most of these. 
<br>
<p>Still, as a hypothetical program one could imagine something akin
<br>
to a modern western liberal democratic welfare state, with a
<br>
commitment to equalization of opportunity through voluntary
<br>
treatments and a certain level of income redistribution, basic
<br>
guaranteed minimal income and medical treatments and culturally
<br>
dominated by ideas of tolerance, cooperation and the rights of
<br>
minorities. While there are many practical issues about the
<br>
financing of such reforms, how to ensure government
<br>
accountability and fairness, and what limits on coercion this
<br>
state would pose, the main question is whether this is compatible
<br>
with the transhumanism.
<br>
<p>As far as I can see, such a system may be in accordance with the
<br>
humanist conception of the human as a striving, self-realizing
<br>
being: help for individual striving is provided, but giving help
<br>
or advice is not agency-limiting coercion. The protection from
<br>
abuse is also in full accordance with humanist rights. Where
<br>
things get iffy is the secondary consequences of providing these
<br>
things; since some form of taxation has to be employed to pay,
<br>
means of coercing taxes from the citizens (or their
<br>
organizations) have to be included which limits individual
<br>
freedom beyond the limitations that appear due to the reciprocity
<br>
of rights (if I claim to have a right to my property, I must also
<br>
acknowledge your right to your property or end up in
<br>
inconsistency). This could in principle be avoided if the society
<br>
was recognized as a voluntary organization where citizens agree
<br>
to play by the legal rules and submit taxes for their mutual
<br>
benefit. 
<br>
<p>There are other potential effects counter to humanist aims due to
<br>
strong equalization attempts, such as equalization of outcome
<br>
(which can occur even if the aim is equalization of opportunity
<br>
if citizens achieving good outcomes are relatively penalized both
<br>
by taxation and by extra support given to competing outcome-poor
<br>
citizens) and the risk of mistaking or switching negative rights
<br>
for positive rights (a quite common tendency today, where rights
<br>
are often interpreted as entitlements). But given the assumption
<br>
that this society rests on a voluntary basis there is no
<br>
fundamental ethical reason why it would not be transhumanist. It
<br>
might be less (or more) effective in supporting human excellence
<br>
than other possible societies, but if the participants have
<br>
agreed on this society it is their problem and by the same
<br>
arguments given before against collectivism it would seem that it
<br>
would be inconsistent with a transhumanist position to prevent
<br>
them from doing so. On the other hand, forcing people into
<br>
agreements to join such a society is by the same arguments,
<br>
counter to the humanism underlying transhumanism. 
<br>
<p>To sum up, the version of radical democratic transhumanism I have
<br>
sketched here seems to be in accordance to the basic humanist
<br>
values as long as it is voluntary. Adherents to this form of
<br>
transhumanism will of course argue that it is a more effective
<br>
way of achieving human excellence than other forms such as
<br>
libertarian transhumanism, but the effectiveness issue is not as
<br>
important in this context as the recognition that both sides
<br>
share important core values. That they also have very divergent
<br>
outlooks is not a problem, since in principle a voluntary radical
<br>
democratic transhumanism (somebody better invent a shorter term!)
<br>
can co-exist and cooperate when suitable with a libertarian
<br>
transhumanism. Just as individual excellence can be pursued in
<br>
many unique ways, there is no reason transhumanism - even with
<br>
defined core values - has to be expressed or implemented in a
<br>
single model. But the same arguments that lead to humanist
<br>
recognition that this pluralism of individual striving must be
<br>
respected lead to the respect of people to freely choose what
<br>
social models to join.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the best way of reconciling the differences
<br>
between the different views is to recognize transhumanism as a
<br>
meta-ideology, not attempting to prescribe all aspects of
<br>
political ideology but providing an underlying set of values and
<br>
assumptions. 
<br>
<p><p>2.5 The problem with a technology identified transhumanism
<br>
<p>I hope that by now it is fairly clear why I do not accept a
<br>
definition of transhumanism only in terms of its commitment to
<br>
advanced technology. Such a definition has no core values (other
<br>
than possibly that technology itself is somehow a good), and even
<br>
when paired with another ideology such as utopian socialism
<br>
(nanotechnology will provide us with enough material plenty to
<br>
enable a true communist society) the result is meager. Besides
<br>
just creating a slightly updated variant of an old ideology, it
<br>
also makes this variant strongly dependent on the actual success
<br>
of the technology. Should nanotechnology never arrive, or have
<br>
properties making it unsuitable to the vision of public domain
<br>
matter compliers in every corner, then the nanosocialist vision
<br>
crashes. 
<br>
<p>But the future development of technology is highly uncertain
<br>
(although plenty of transhumanists suffer from technological
<br>
determinism, one of the less desirable inheritances from the
<br>
enlightenment progress idea) and subject to not just random
<br>
accident but complex social, economic and political factors,
<br>
where ideologies and visions are important. Connecting an
<br>
ideology too strongly to a certain technology is a recipe for
<br>
either becoming obsolete, or an invitation towards technocracy
<br>
where the ideology now motivates its adherents to implement the
<br>
technological vision it believes in, regardless of whether it is
<br>
truly efficient or achievable.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is not about technology, it is about placing
<br>
technology, the human condition and their interactions in a
<br>
humanist context. 
<br>
<p>This escapes the trap of requiring certain technologies to
<br>
achieve transhumanity - we might live in a cruel universe where
<br>
most of the technologies discussed on this list are impossible.
<br>
But that would not make transhumanism worthless, merely limit
<br>
what forms of excellence we can aspire to. Recognizing that
<br>
transhumanism is not just about technology also avoids the trap
<br>
of assuming technology is all we need, which can lead to
<br>
technocracy (&quot;If we can control technology we can control
<br>
everything&quot;) and technonaivism (&quot;Technology will fix all
<br>
problems&quot;) - two of the main accusations commonly leveled at
<br>
transhumanism. 
<br>
<p><p>3. What should transhumanism as a movement strive towards?
<br>
<p>I have now dealt with some of the roots of the transhumanist
<br>
movement, as well as a concept of transhumanism that is firmly
<br>
based in terms of the humanist perspective and an ideology in
<br>
itself. Now, what do we do about it as a movement?
<br>
<p>It is important to remember that there is a difference between
<br>
the movement (which consists of a number of persons adhering to
<br>
views they themselves call transhumanist or share with other
<br>
self-professed transhumanists) and the ideology of transhumanism.
<br>
As James showed in his paper at present the movement encompasses
<br>
many mutually incompatible ideologies. As I have argued, only a
<br>
part of these views are actually compatible with the name
<br>
transhumanism, and these share underlying core values that are
<br>
actually found in mainstream transhumanism, be it libertarian or
<br>
democratic left in outlook. 
<br>
<p>Redefining the term transhumanism in a more narrow sense and with
<br>
clearly defined values is trivial; the nontrivial part is to turn
<br>
the redefinition into political reality.  Maybe one could call it
<br>
humanistic transhumanism, but such a redundant term seems far
<br>
less appealing than either reclaiming the term transhumanism,
<br>
developing a new term or maybe ignore the naming issue altogether
<br>
- it is in many ways a trivial distraction, and a movement that
<br>
needs a shared name to exist clearly lacks the shared ideas to
<br>
survive.
<br>
<p>As James points out the transhumanist perspective is under
<br>
serious attack from a variety of directions, and it is clear that
<br>
unless the movement does something it and its views are going to
<br>
be relegated to an insignificant underdog position (something
<br>
that may actually appeal so some people, since being an underdog
<br>
culturally in the west has been viewed as a sign of purity and
<br>
righteousness - as well as a way of getting one's own small,
<br>
manageable social corner rather than have to deal with complex
<br>
issues in a setting where there is a plurality of opinions and
<br>
one is just one part among many). However, if there is no other
<br>
transhumanist ideology than &quot;technology often is good&quot; then it
<br>
seems unlikely many people would invest their time and effort to
<br>
counteract the often persuasive and passionately delivered
<br>
opposition - it is too broad and too shallow. Instead, if
<br>
transhumanists are ideologically aware of their underlying
<br>
values, how these values also underlie many other highly regarded
<br>
institutions in modern democracies (everything from freedom of
<br>
press to the dignity of man) and their long historical roots
<br>
connecting them to an immense amount of philosophical and
<br>
cultural capital - then they can find not just motivation but
<br>
powerful allies. 
<br>
<p>There is a danger in assuming that the broadest possible movement
<br>
is the best. There are always people eager to flock to any banner
<br>
but who do not contribute anything, do not share the basic values
<br>
or are willing to compromise them in exchange for small
<br>
victories. This problem becomes worse if the movement is overly
<br>
broad and does not know its own values. When discussion turns to
<br>
actual politics, it can be devastating to not have developed
<br>
one's own ideas fully.
<br>
<p>We have seen many examples during the 20th century of how
<br>
strongly ideological groups, even when they wield minimal power
<br>
or have relatively few members, have affected broad policies and
<br>
shifted political consensus in their direction by exploiting the
<br>
lack of ideology of their opponents (e.g. the environmental
<br>
movement and parts of the left). What happened was that the less
<br>
ideological part made a compromise and moved halfway to their
<br>
opponent, while the opponent remained at their original position.
<br>
The result was that the middle of the road moved ever towards the
<br>
ideologicals, while the compromisers found themselves ever more
<br>
biased. 
<br>
<p>We are currently seeing how the corporativist-technocratic
<br>
establishment is starting to crack; instead of the until recently
<br>
mainly technological/administrative discourse in politics value
<br>
issues are becoming more important again. This is an opening, but
<br>
also a terrible risk. There are many other values out there, and
<br>
many of the currently most successful values are not particularly
<br>
conductive to human flourishing - be they religious or political
<br>
fundamentalism, romantic nationalism with fascist overtones,
<br>
national security as more important than human rights in the US
<br>
or European &quot;throw out the niggers so we get more welfare&quot; racism
<br>
in Italy, Holland, Denmark and Austria. 
<br>
<p>Virginia Postrel's description of the struggle between dynamism
<br>
and stasism may be a (helpful) oversimplification, but one thing
<br>
is clear: the anti-humanist ideas above are clearly on the
<br>
stasist side in that they seek to control and limit the future
<br>
and human potential. On the dynamist side we find ideas about the
<br>
right of humans to set up their own goals, to create their own
<br>
life projects freely - necessary conditions for transhumanism.
<br>
Dynamism is in the end about having an open ended society, where
<br>
creativity and freedom are allowed to generate progress even when
<br>
it is unpredictable. Transhumanism as a humanist ideology would
<br>
be squarely on this side.
<br>
<p>In the end we as transhumanists want to live in a dynamistic
<br>
world where our own aims of personal and social excellence are
<br>
possible to pursue to their fullest. But to reach this we clearly
<br>
need to 1) recognize our core values, 2) extend our
<br>
ideology/ideologies from these values, 3) show the other people
<br>
the moral and practical benefits of embracing them as practical
<br>
policies. This is a large task, and cannot be done in the wrong
<br>
order. 
<br>
<p>Transhumanism has so far never been truly fighting a political
<br>
battle, neither as an ideology or as a movement of people. So far
<br>
it has never produced any truly hard and innovative challenges to
<br>
the current dominant ideological systems. That has to change.
<br>
<p>The ideologies of today in general have their roots in other
<br>
material and cultural conditions. If we seek to retain ties to
<br>
ideologies that at best developed in 1850 (and in several cases
<br>
long before that) because they are our only source of values,
<br>
then we are bound to lose touch with reality. We cannot rely on
<br>
naive faith in technology. 
<br>
<p>But we can recognize our core humanist values and build on them.
<br>
In a changing world, they are surprisingly stable and likely the
<br>
last things we will ever change in ourselves in some unimaginable
<br>
posthuman future. We can strive for human flourishing and
<br>
recognize what is and isn't transhumanism in this sense. We can
<br>
extend our ideas beyond a mere liking for technology into an
<br>
integrated ideological framework wide enough to encompass a wide
<br>
spectrum of practical dynamist position - while at the same time
<br>
having clear enough goals to avoid getting shallow and
<br>
opportunistic. 
<br>
<p><p>I cannot say whether things will get better if we change; what I
<br>
can say is they must change if they are to get better.
