<em>&gt; &gt; Our disagreement, if there is one, is that I believe that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limitation will become a /more/ significant factor limiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wealth as we advance, and you seem to contend that it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become less of a factor, and that more of our wealth will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; informational and such.  Your scenario is quite possible, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I won't discount it out of hand, but I can't share it. No matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how much wealth we create over and above natural resources,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone with more natural resources can still create more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone with less.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except for raw matter and energy, what but information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology to use the information would be of benefit after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deployment of full MNT?   How would having other &quot;natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources&quot; be of great advantage.  I honestly don't see how.
</em><br>
<p>I'm talking about mass-energy.  Are you not listening?  Am I
<br>
not speaking plain English?  There is, essentially, no natural
<br>
resource other than mass-energy.  But one is enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yep, I'm one of those.  Owned things get put to effective use;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things in the commons are inevitably destroyed and neglected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't it bother you that it is literally impossible to impose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership on every erg of energy?  Do you not understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values of commons to innovation?  
</em><br>
<p>Two different questions: for one, I reject your childish
<br>
we-can't-be-perfect-so-let's-not-try-at-all argument. Ownership
<br>
of things works well, today, as it has for centuries, and as
<br>
it likely will in the future.  As for the second question, I
<br>
recognize the value of the public domain of ideas for innovation,
<br>
which is why I oppose intellectual property.  But no, I do not
<br>
in any way recognize that the concept of shared ownership of
<br>
capital goods is beneficial in any way to humanity.
