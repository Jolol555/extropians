<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------
<br>
<p>Cost plus
<br>
<p>&quot;Beyond These considerations stands the government contracting system, known
<br>
as &quot;cost plus,&quot; which has been in place for some time now in the United
<br>
States. According to the people who invented the system, it is essential
<br>
that corporations be prevented from earning excessive profits on government
<br>
contracts. Therefore, rather than negotiate a fixed price for a piece of
<br>
hardware and allow the company to make a large profit or loss on the job
<br>
depending on what its internal costs might be, regulators have demanded that
<br>
the company document its internal costs in detail and then be allowed to
<br>
charge a small fixed percentage fee (genarlly in the 10 percent range) above
<br>
those costs as profit. This system has served to multiple the costs of
<br>
government contracting tremendously, so much so that it has produced public
<br>
scandals when news leaks out thabout the military paying $700 for a hammer
<br>
or a toilet seat cover.
<br>
<p>To see how this works, consider the case of the Lockheed Martin corporation,
<br>
the largest aerospace contractor in the world. I was employed as a senoir,
<br>
and later staff, engineer at the prime facility of this company for seven
<br>
years. Lockheed Martin almost never accepts hardware contracts on a fixed
<br>
cost basis. That is, the company rarely says to the U.S. government, &quot;We
<br>
will produce the ABC vehicle for you at a price of $X. If it costs us less
<br>
than $X to make it, we will make a profit. If it costs us more, we will take
<br>
a loss.&quot; Instead, most important contracts are negotiated along the
<br>
following lines: &quot;We will produce ABC vehicle for you at a cost of about $X.
<br>
We will then add a 10 percent for to whatever it actually costs us to
<br>
produce to provide the company with a modest profit.&quot; In other words, the
<br>
more the ABC vehicle costs to produce, the more money the company makes.
<br>
Hence, in addition to the vast numbers of accounting personnel that the
<br>
cost-plus contracting sytstemn necessarily entails, the company is saturated
<br>
with &quot;planners&quot; &quot;marketeers&quot; and &quot;matrix managers&quot; among swarms of other
<br>
overhead personnel. Of the 9,000 people employed at the Lockheed Martin main
<br>
plant in Denver (where the Atlas and Titan launch vehicles are made) only
<br>
about 1,000 actually work in the factory. The fact that Lockheed Martin is
<br>
keenly competitive with other aerospace giants indicates that thier overhead
<br>
structures are similar.
<br>
<p>In the context of this regime, government willingess to give such
<br>
corporations cost-plus contracts for product improvement can acutally serve
<br>
as disincentive for company investment in innovation. A number of years ago,
<br>
I was part of a team that proposed a new upper stage for the Titan rocket,
<br>
which would have increased the vehicle's performance by 50 percent. Creating
<br>
the new upper stage would have required a company investment of abou $150
<br>
million. (Asingle Tital launch sells for between $200 million and $400
<br>
million.) The coporation's management declined, saying, in effect, &quot;If the
<br>
Air Force wants us to improve the Titan, they will pay us to do it.&quot; As a
<br>
result, the Titan was not improved and the company's commercial Titan line
<br>
was shut down when all of its private-market business was taken by the
<br>
slightly less obsolescent French Ariane. The company didn't mind much,
<br>
however, as all of its cost-plus U.S. government launch contracts are
<br>
protected by law from foreign competition, and it faces no U.S. competitors
<br>
in the Titan's payload class.&quot;
