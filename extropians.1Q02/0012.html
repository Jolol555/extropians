</em><br>
<p>Me too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the midst of those many moments when life seems difficult, confusing,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fantastic it is to be ALIVE and growing and learning and experiencing.
</em><br>
<p>Here are my dozen 2002 intentions about this list:
<br>
<p>I announce my own personal jubilee. I have emptied my plonk filter.
<br>
Others are welcome to do the same. Someone repost this for me, would you? 
<br>
<p>I'm going to choose my arguments and move from justificationalism to as close
<br>
to full time pancrit as I can.
<br>
<p>I'm going to re-read Strunk &amp; White (with that grain of salt handy). I'm going to
<br>
use this list to hone my communications craft and Omit Needless Words(!).
<br>
<p>I declare smileys deprecated in my writing. They're from IRC, etc. They can't be
<br>
speed read effectively unless you have more years doing that than I have. They don't
<br>
translate well into regular print.
<br>
I'll still do my best to take them into account when others use them.
<br>
<p>I'm going to look out for topic drift as part of that and try to see if my replies
<br>
are actually relevant to the original post. If it's a simple concurrence, CONC 
<br>
goes in the subject line. If it's some silly riposte, HUMOR goes there.
<br>
<p>If I hear an old thread coming through, I'll mark it as such in the title: OLDIE.
<br>
If I smell a red herring, I'll also change the title to reflect that: OTT (off thread 
<br>
topic), maybe.
<br>
<p>I'm going to tune the subject line as soon as I think of a more fitting one that
<br>
actually adds value.
<br>
<p>I'm going to count on my mail reader to help keep threads sorted even when the
<br>
Subject changes.
<br>
<p>I'm going to double check the quotes whenver I use inline quoting, to make sure I'm
<br>
not propagating an attribution error.
<br>
<p>I'm going to try to find a way to use AceReader Pro to read the extro list effectively.
<br>
If I can up my reading speed considered as a whole, I'll post my technique here.
<br>
<p>Same goes for an email reader that gives me a wordcount on emails before I open them, not
<br>
just kbytes. Smart about nontext inclusions, of course.
<br>
<p>I'm going to keep steering away from the tendency to repost every line of the things I reply to,
<br>
especially if it's more than 200 words. The point is Value Added, yes? What value am I adding?
<br>
<p>I'm going to stop writing my name at the end of posts. That's what the .sig line is f
<br>
