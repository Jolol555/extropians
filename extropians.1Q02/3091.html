<p>That all sounds good to me.  In fact it sounds a lot like the &quot;dumb&quot; AI I'm 
<br>
in favor of.  But my impression is that many here (notably Eli) think that 
<br>
won't be good enough.  The opinion seems to be that in order to bring about 
<br>
the Tech Singularity, you need an AI which is every bit as sentient, 
<br>
intelligent and self-aware as we are (in fact, even more so).
<br>
<p>My point (which seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle) is that once you 
<br>
have a super-human AI that learns and processes information *way* faster 
<br>
than we do (particularly one that is self-enhancing and hence learns at an 
<br>
exponentially accelerating rate) that it will be impossible, either by 
<br>
friendly &quot;supergoals&quot; or otherwise, to keep the AI from transcending any 
<br>
limits we might hope to impose on it.  Which will lead to us being 
<br>
completely at its mercy.
<br>
<p>My point in a nutsell: friendliness cannot be imposed on one's superior.  
<br>
Genes tried it, and made a good run of it for quite a while.  Increasing our 
<br>
intelligence made our genes ever more successful than the competitors of our 
<br>
species.  But, as our genes found out, too much of a good thing is a bad 
<br>
thing.  We now pursue gene-imposed subgoals (sex, for instance) while 
<br>
bypassing completely the supergoals (i.e., kids) at our whim.
<br>
<p>I've still not heard any sound argument on how we can prevent the same thing 
<br>
from happening to us and our &quot;supergoals&quot; once the AI is our intellectual 
<br>
superior.

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man.

Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
