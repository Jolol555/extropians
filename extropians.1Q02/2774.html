<p>It made so much sense that I didn't bother to reply. :-)
<br>
<p>If you control the physical network topology you can improve the
<br>
routing dramatically, of course. The internet is anarchy, and the
<br>
it's routing is designed and implemented chaotically. It still manages
<br>
to function fairly well at 50% utilization, so my argument stands.
<br>
<p>We all know that we can get from 50% to not more than 90% with clever
<br>
routing, so routing is not an interesting accelerator. To become more
<br>
efficient, we need to employ tricks like caching and task migration
<br>
that minimize the need for bandwidth. Again, this mostly requires the
<br>
net to be under more centralized control.
<br>
<p>I'm attracted to the Internet as an analogy for emergent behavior
<br>
precisely because of its decentralized control. The Internet is a
<br>
collection independent networks that use frightenly informal agreements
<br>
about how to route traffic. They base these agreements on poorly
<br>
specified protocols that are loosely documented by an informal
<br>
organization known as the IETF. Each of the networks is cobbled together
<br>
from routers from vendors that don't particularly like each other.
<br>
networks frequently use multi-layer &quot;overlay&quot; techniques such as IP
<br>
over ATM wherein the layers react to each other in unforeseen ways.
<br>
This entire mess manages to provide good service to most of the users
<br>
most of the time while growing at a phenomenal rate. The growth of the
<br>
internet is not constrained by this chaos. It is constrained by the
<br>
&quot;last mile.&quot; The last mile is provided by entities (mostly telephone
<br>
companies) that adhere to a more structure, controlled, and centralized
<br>
model.
<br>
<p>How does this relate to progress in AI? Well I hope it demonstrated that
<br>
there is no need for central planning. Instead, the Internet is the most
<br>
most complex, expensive, biggest, and fastest growing entity humanity
<br>
has ever created, and we did it by accident and without central control
