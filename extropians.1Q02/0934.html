Hey Samantha
<br>
I know its a right, you know its a right, the state says it aint, and the
<br>
state is bigger than me, was disgusted to discover this myself (what is the
<br>
law? the law is what the Judge says it is!)
<br>
ever wonder why you need a License for it?
<br>
<p>More on  Ex. Parte Kinney (May 14, 1879) Fed cas. page 602 (case no. 7,825)
<br>
<p>&quot;Marriage is a privilege belonging to persons as members of society, and as
<br>
citizens of the states in which they reside
<br>
and may be abridged at the will of the states in which they reside&quot;
<br>
&quot;Marriage, though a contract is more than a civil contract and is not
<br>
affected by the clause of the tenth section of the first article of the
<br>
constitution forbidding a state from passing any laws impairing the
<br>
obligation of contracts&quot;
