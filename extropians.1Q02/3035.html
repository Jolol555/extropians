<DIV>&gt;The father felt as I did, and anyone else who had extensive contact with the situation, that this was a disaster in the making. The kid had become a pure "performer," having had every creative capacity stifled by the mother. Where that creative energy will now erupt - now that the kid is finally free away at college - and how is a question that keeps me awake at night.&nbsp;</DIV></P></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;... Not that I have any problem with super learning environments. My opinion is that we could effectively double human intelligence if we provided more optimal early childhood feedback. But this is so often intimately tied to parental ambition that the negative effects of one are confused with positive effects of the other. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;

<P>Dose this imply that&nbsp;groups or individuals outside the child's immediate family may be better suited to the task? Just an idea, but sometimes even a small margin of objectivity can make a huge difference. Children are extremely complex beings &amp; probably require similarly complex systems to accommodate their needs. I'm not suggesting that education be provided by one or the other (parents vs. designated educators) - both groups would obviously have to work in partnership for the best interest of the *child* (not themselves). Also, I would imagine, given more intellectual &amp; creative space/freedom, the child would&nbsp;be more motivated to learn &amp; progress simply for enjoyment rather than coercion. This idea of self-motivation,&nbsp;regardless of&nbsp;its results, should be the cornerstone for any healthy &amp; enduring program of education.</P>

<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; As for the anti-Extropianism of giving birth to a conscious entity with the intention of making him into a little slave who never frees himself from his mother's apron strings, I hope that speaks for itself. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; &gt;In fact, I think it is pretty much the worst thing that parents can do with their children, and it does happen a lot and does generate a lot of suffering, as I have very often observed around me to various degrees. It is the essence of parental abuse, and I am thankful for my own parents to have deliberately and carefuly avoided anything like that.

<DIV>It was mentioned sometime last week that only people who could sufficiently provide for, support, &amp; educate their children should have them. While that makes sense, it is still possible for the child to be plagued with emotional &amp; psychological trauma as a direct result of the parents, even if these needs are met.</DIV>
<DIV>Its a really difficult question - how do you raise a child? Its not like they&nbsp;emerge from the womb&nbsp;with maintainance manuals or anything. I'm just glad I don't have any of my own so I won't have to lose sleep over it (like I know my parents do about me :P)</DIV>
