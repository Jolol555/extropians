<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But at what cost, Harvey? Because medical care costs money, every

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;dollar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spent is x.xx hours of someone's life spent laboring for

<em>&gt;themselves or

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the government. Why slave away x hours of your life when you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only going to get a fraction of that back in increased life span?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because I value my lifespan more than money.  I want to live longer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working if I can.  Why die early to save a little dough?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I think you miss the point, Harvey: &quot;work&quot; is, by definition, time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;spent in pursuits other than what would be one's first choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;what to do with that time.  If you work for 12 hours to earn enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;to increase your lifespan by only 8 hours, then you haven't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;increased your &quot;life&quot; span at all--just your &quot;work&quot; span. You've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;actually lost 4 hours of &quot;life&quot;--life is doing what /you/ want with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;your time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An interesting and thoughful point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thanks, and thanks to Lee for 'splainin' it better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, how do you explain situations like the WWII Nazi concentration 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;camp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gas chambers, where those inline to be gassed, when their turn came to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the dreaded chamber, would grab the person in line behind them, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;throw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that person into the gas chamber in their stead.  With the armed guards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blocking escape, those throwers gained a few seconds of life, but just a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seconds, and cringing, tearful, fearful seconds...not exactly quality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the grandkids, either....it was a very common occurrence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Our &quot;visceral&quot; understanding of life is far different than our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;philosophical&quot; understanding of life...guess which one I value more...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gas chamber episodes of &quot;Kill HIM, not ME!&quot; panic are essentially a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instinctual, subconcious response that I very much doubt that many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people would commit unless they had already been subjected to a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of concentration camp level torture...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For every such instance of cowardice, I can recite many more of courage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the face of death (been there twice already myself) where people save
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other's lives at great risk to their own without a seconds concious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for my own life extension plans, I'd rather invest my life savings in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryonic suspension than in staving off the 'old timers disease' for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year or two. I've just gone through a year of dealing with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grandmonsters at the end stage (grandma Burnett died a couple months ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after years of light senility and recent hip and arm fractures, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grandpa Burnett is still a nearly comatose alzheimers patient here in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;town, and likely will be for several years), and as my grandma Lorrey
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said recently, &quot;If I ever get like that, take me out behind the barn and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shoot me.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In my case, shoot me full of suspension fluid.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't you say you were leaving the list? Well, please don't. You make a lot 
<br>
of sense....more than many others on this list....
<br>
<p>Anyway, my theory is that the brain is just like the body in many 
<br>
respects--the &quot;shrunk shank&quot; of our old age is matched by a greatly 
<br>
incapacitated brain.  Can we say that a old, incapacitated person is the 
<br>
same person he was at a younger age, in the sense of what makes a person a 
<br>
&quot;person&quot;? I am not sure we can that say...very old people, many of them, 
<br>
anyway, are IMO, in some sense, not people at all. I know that sounds 
<br>
cold....but I was never one to shy away from what I see as the facts.
<br>
<p>Yes, I also very much would prefer the chance to be suspended before age 
<br>
steals personhood from me....but are there any cryonicists who would not say 
<br>
the same....and who takes this oppurtunity from us? Our own brethren, our 
<br>
fellow citizens. However, I think that polls show that somewhat over 50% of 
<br>
all US voters favor legalized suicide....it is the politicians who would 
<br>
stop us.
