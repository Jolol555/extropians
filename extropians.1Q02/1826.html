Very interesting article, though I dont see any mention of extracting energy
<br>
using the Casimir force.  I thought that these particles were not just
<br>
particle / antiparticle pairs (or photon wavicles or whatever) but they are
<br>
energy 'Anti'-energy pairs as well, a la Einstein's Mass energy equivalency
<br>
- E^2 * P^2 = M0^2 * C^4 (E=mc^2 is simplified version)  which allows for
<br>
positive and negative energy and positive and negative mass.  Hawking showed
<br>
that these particle pairs that formed on the event horizons of black holes
<br>
could split and stay in existence, half pummeling toward the black hole and
<br>
the other half radiating into space, if the 'anti'-energy photon hits the
<br>
black hole, it and regular energy cancel each other out (no energy release,
<br>
just both cease to exist) hence black holes evaporate over time, and black
<br>
holes emit radiation.  For energy to be extracted from the radiation,
<br>
something has to happen to the 'anti'-energy half, that is, cancel out other
<br>
regular energy.  I also thought that these particles exist for very short
<br>
lengths of time, on order of the planck length.  Because of these things, I
<br>
was under the impression that there was no way to extract energy from
<br>
quantum fluctations.  How might one extract energy from quantum
<br>
fluctuations?  And if you could, could you get usuable energy without
<br>
increasing the entropy in the universe and thus avoiding heat death?

Subject: NANO: Casimir force a source of energy/propulsion?
<br>
<p><p>It seems that some researchers, including some at NASA, are researching
<br>
the use of MEMS devices to extract energy from Zero Point Field quantum
<br>
fluctuations:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/021401/Quantum_effect_moves_machine_021401.htm">http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/021401/Quantum_effect_moves_machine_021401.htm</a>
<br>

<br>
<p>According to classical physics, a vacuum at a temperature of absolute
<br>
zero contains no matter or energy. But according to quantum physics,
<br>
this emptiness isn't really empty. It is filled with fluctuating energy. 
<br>
<p>Classical physics, as epitomized by Newton's laws, describes how matter
<br>
and energy operate in the everyday world. Quantum physics describes the
<br>
very different conditions that exist in the realm of atoms and subatomic
<br>
particles. 
<br>
<p>A team at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs has shown that as researchers
<br>
make ever smaller machines, the quantum effect of zero point energy
<br>
could come into play. The researchers built a microelectromechanical
<br>
device similar to those used as tiny sensors and actuators, and measured
<br>
how this energy affected it. 
<br>
<p>Zero point energy is created by subatomic particles that appear out of
<br>
nothing, then rapidly disappear. Because many of the particles are
<br>
photons, much of the energy is electromagnetic like light, x-rays and
<br>
radio waves. &quot;This energy pervades all space. It's everywhere,&quot; said Ho
<br>
Bun Chan, a physicist at Bell Labs. 
<br>
<p>The energy becomes a factor in the world of devices when two parallel
<br>
plates are positioned closely enough that the gap between them is
<br>
smaller than some electromagnetic wavelengths. This means that some of
<br>
the zero point energy is shut out of the gap. Because there is more zero
<br>
point energy acting on the outer surfaces of the plates than the inner
<br>
surfaces, the plates are drawn together. 
<br>
<p>The phenomenon, predicted in 1948 by the Dutch physicist Hendrik
<br>
Casimir, observed in 1958 and measured in 1996, is called the Casimir
<br>
effect. &quot;This force arises merely because of the existence of the two
<br>
plates,&quot; said Chan. 
<br>
<p>Though the force is very small at the micro scale, it increases rapidly
<br>
as the distance between the plates decreases. The force between parallel
<br>
plates can be as large as an atmosphere, or 14.7 pounds per square inch
<br>
of pressure, at a distance of 10 nanometers, said Umar Mohideen, an
<br>
associate professor of physics at the University of California at
<br>
Riverside. 
<br>
<p>The Bell Labs' device consists of a 500-micron-square, 3.5-micron thick
<br>
silicon plate suspended above a silicon wafer. The plate pivots, seesaw
<br>
fashion, between two tiny rods. Electrodes sit on the wafer under each
<br>
end of the seesaw. As the plate tilts, the capacitance on the lower side
<br>
increases while that of the higher side decreases, allowing the
<br>
researchers to measure very small changes in the position of the plate. 
<br>
<p>The researchers induced the Casimir effect in their device by lowering a
<br>
200-micron-diameter sphere over the plate. &quot;When the plate is actuated
<br>
by the Casimir force, the rotation is only about a thousandth of a
<br>
degree. It's a tiny rotation, but it's detectable,&quot; said Chan. 
<br>
<p>The Bell Labs research &quot;is the first step in the design and fabrication
<br>
of novel MEMS devices based on the Casimir force,&quot; said Mohideen.
<br>
&quot;Finally, devices based on quantum fluctuations... are coming to
<br>
fruition. This is very exciting.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The researchers used a sphere rather than a second plate because it's
<br>
easier to work with even though the Casimir effect is less pronounced
<br>
between a sphere and a plate, said Chan. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We are talking about separations [of] less than a tenth of a
<br>
micrometer,&quot; he said. &quot;It's very difficult to keep two plates perfectly
<br>
parallel. If you use a sphere there's only one point where it's closest
<br>
to the plate. It basically gets rid of the alignment problem,&quot; he said. 
<br>
<p>The plate tilted due to the Casimir effect when the sphere was 300
<br>
nanometers above one end of the plate. The tilt increased sharply as the
<br>
researchers moved the sphere closer to the plate. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We can speculate [about] making very sensitive position sensors, for
<br>
example, because this force rises very quickly with distance,&quot; said
<br>
Chan. 
<br>
<p>As Bell Labs' use of a sphere illustrates, the effect is not limited to
<br>
parallel plates. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The Casimir force is strongly shape dependent and can be repulsive as
<br>
well as attractive,&quot; said Mohideen. &quot;It can be further modified with
<br>
subtle texturing on the surfaces, like putting in corrugations.
<br>
Incorporating the shape-dependent Casimir force should give an
<br>
additional knob for engineers to turn in future MEMS designs,&quot; he said. 
<br>
<p>A NASA-funded project is even exploring how to use the Casimir effect in
<br>
a propulsion system for spacecraft. 
<br>
<p>The Casimir effect is already a problem for fabricating MEMS devices
<br>
because at very short distances free surfaces tend to stick together,
<br>
said Mohideen. &quot;During the fabrication step, it is very hard to make
<br>
free moving surfaces such as cantilevers [and] bridges which are
<br>
separated by short distances,&quot; he said.
