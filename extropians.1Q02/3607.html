<p><em>&gt; &gt; Our brain was not designed to do philosophy (nor science) as you may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realize. It was designed to be distracted, to react in real time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threats, etc. We manage to think more refined thoughts with the aid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that intellectual augmentation called writing.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very interesting post. If what you say is correct (I personally think it is)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then what are the implications of the decline in the use of the printed word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the move to a more visual culture among the majority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population-which I think is happening in modern societies ? 
</em><br>
<p>'The printed word' is subject to interpretation. I am currently printing
<br>
words here on this 'techne mediation interface'. I can guarrantee that
<br>
I've printed far more words on this mail list alone than in my entire
<br>
prior life (yeah, yeah, keep the barbs to yourself... ;)), and I would
<br>
posit this is true for most everyone who uses computers today. In the
<br>
past ten years, I would say I've easily posted over 100,000 emails to
<br>
various newsgroups, BBS's, email lists, etc over the internet, which
<br>
would be somewhere between 10-100 million words produced (yeah, yeah, go
<br>
ahead and say a billion times zero is still zero... ;) ) at the very
<br>
least. I've 'met' and exchanged far more meaningful conversations with
<br>
far more intelligent people than I would ever have met otherwise.
<br>
<p>At the very least, I type as fast as a secretary can, and consequently
<br>
don't need one (though I could certainly use some help
<br>
organizationally). 
<br>
<p>I would have previously scoffed at philosophy and philosophers in
<br>
general as being in a group with psychiatrists, lawyers, politicians,
<br>
and bureaucrats as being individuals and careers that could dissapear
<br>
tomorrow and few of the rest of us would shed a tear (now it's just
<br>
*some* philosophers and philosophies).
<br>
<p>I think Socrates said that the best school is a log with student sitting
<br>
on one end and teacher on the other. The log is the 'techne mediation
<br>
device'. What form it manifests itself as is really rather irrelevant,
<br>
so long as it works, and continues to become better at its task, as the
<br>
student applies what is learned to the function of the log.
