<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;For Mike and his fellow conservative ideologues, consider an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;intelligence enhancement for your children which has an observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;side effect: almost all of them become Socialists.  Quel horreur!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then clearly the intelligence enhancement was a failure, give Greg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Burch or one of his associates a call.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to mention Hal's claim is false.
</em><br>
<p>As should be clear, I was not making a claim, but advancing a thought
<br>
experiment.  Only the most ideologically arrogant would believe that
<br>
enhancing the intelligence of their children would be guaranteed to make
<br>
them follow the politics of their parents.  My post was an invitation to
<br>
consider how it would feel if this did not hold.  Someone with a strong
<br>
political ideology would then be put in something of the same position
<br>
as the deaf parents today.  They might even begin to feel some empathy
<br>
for the deaf parents' situation, rather than the attitudes of contempt
<br>
and scorn which Mike and others adopted.
<br>
<p>Those who are 100% certain that they are correct about everything
<br>
involving politics and human relations need not pursue the matter.
<br>
Such closed minds are largely immune to education and enlightenment,
<br>
in any case.
