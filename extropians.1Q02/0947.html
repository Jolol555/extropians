<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;What right has Hollywood to dramatically re-write a Nobel Prize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;winner's life so that it appeals better to those in the midwest?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;From: Brian D Williams
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Hey, that's pretty good!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You managed to peg both my &quot;stereotype&quot; and my &quot;bigot&quot; meters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and I had the scale set to LOG...
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Perhaps you should tune your meter. Its good to see this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion immediately heading towards an ad hominem attack. Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you really think I am a bigot? I am not really sure what you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by &quot;bigot&quot; in this context. If I am going to be insulted it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be good to have a clear idea of the insult.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually I carefully referenced the statement rather than an
<br>
individual. It would take more than a single statement to qualify
<br>
an individual as a bigot.
<br>
<p><p>Technically the statement directed against the midwest amounts to
<br>
an ad hominem against a third of the country. (east coast, midwest,
<br>
west coast.) Only persons who make these statements on a regular
<br>
basis (&gt;1) qualify as either east or west coast bigots
<br>
specifically.
<br>
<p>I was not insulting you, but with tongue firmly in cheek pointing
<br>
out something about a particular statement you made.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Anyway do you really think that there are no regional differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in values across America? I was referring specifically to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;removal of Nash's bisexuality from the film. Personally I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this is in  general less likely offend audiences in either SF, LA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or NY, as compared to Oklahoma City, but I could be wrong.  As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;data point check out:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.tolerance.org/maps/hate/index.html">http://www.tolerance.org/maps/hate/index.html</a>
</em><br>
<p><p>I understand, but the midwest also includes Chicago which has  
<br>
vibrant non-traditional sexual communities, and New Orleans forming
<br>
a midwest axis of sorts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In general I would expect the greatest tolerance to come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those in mixed urban environments, but perhaps I am wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree with this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I certainly DO NOT believe that most people from the midwest (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anywhere else) are particularly homophobic, and if I implied this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I certainly apologize.
</em><br>
<p><p>And from another post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;On further thought you are right. My comment was out of line. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was wrong to imply anything about the midwest and I am very glad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you corrected me. I just was not thinking when I wrote that line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My thanks for pulling me up. I appreciate that.
</em><br>
<p><p>I am equally guilty at times of not being specific enough with
<br>
language. 
<br>
<p>No harm, no foul.... ;)
