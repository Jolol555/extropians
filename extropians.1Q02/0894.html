</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thank you. The reason why I used writing to compare the ages of various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilizations is that writing is the primary tool of Lamarkian social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolution. Societies which relied purely on oral traditions were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very developed, never very organized into city/nation states (since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; city/nation states depend upon the existence of writing to function),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and thus societies with only oral traditions cannot be considered true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'civilizations'. They can be considered cultures, but not civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; due to this absence of writing technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting. What do you say about pre-Columbian South America (esp the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Incas and Chimu)? As I understand these did have cities and complex large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale political organisation but no writing system. 
</em><br>
<p>The Incas did have a primitive writing system in development at the time
<br>
of the conquistadors. The &quot;Complex large scale political organization&quot;
<br>
was nothing more than a priestly caste, but I would not characterise
<br>
their culture as a 'civilization'. They had not invented the wheel for
<br>
transportation (something that the barbaric tribes of the eurasian
<br>
steppes had had for thousands of years prior). Their 'cities' were
<br>
nothing more than large religious complexes surrounded by several
<br>
villages, and they had no metals technology beyond working with gold,
<br>
copper, and in a few cases, bronze. Iron technology was just beginning
<br>
to be experimented with by a few Toltec tribes at the time of the
<br>
Conquistadors.
<br>
<p>Any culture in which the vast majority of economic activity is spent on
<br>
religious worship has no need of a written language, has no need of
<br>
technological development, and is also not complex enough to be
<br>
considered a 'civilization'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For this reason, the Aryan culture from whence sanskrit developed cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be considered a 'civilization' prior to the development of written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sanskrit. Given this, my original point that western civilizations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; older than eastern ones continues to stand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is true if by &quot;western&quot; you mean &quot;West Asian/Mid East&quot;. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sumerians had writing about 3200BC but it's 1500BC for China. In India the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indus civilisation has writing from anout 2600BC but there doesn't seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be any continuity between them and the Indian civilisation which develops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the Aryan &quot;invasion&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations are to be considered western
<br>
civilizations, since the entire judeo-christian origins of our modern
<br>
law, the phoenecian origins of our written language, the Syrian origins
<br>
of our steel technology, and the Egyptian origins of our civil
<br>
engineering technologies all come from the area. 
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that modern definitions of east and west are based upon a
<br>
location's relationship to the English prime meridian, which passes thru
<br>
Greenwich, England. This arbitrary meridian has no relation to the
<br>
origins of western culture.
