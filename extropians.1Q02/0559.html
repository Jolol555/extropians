</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;.... and the fluor chemistry and the satellites, and ... Yes, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these are all by-products, not the primary goal. The primary goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was to land on the moon. Instead of shooting two men on the moon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a disproportionate waste of money and resources to breed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microchip and a teflon pan, we could have gone straight for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chip (and the pan). The possible uses were predictable at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time. 
</em><br>
<p>I completely dispute that the possible uses were predictable at
<br>
that time.
<br>
<p>The president set an almost unbelievable goal. Virtually none of
<br>
the technology that was used to achieve this goal existed at the
<br>
time. (from the engineers who created it.)
<br>
<p>Yes he fired their immaginations and as a result we received many
<br>
beneficial technologies as a bonus. Technologies who's return has
<br>
been many times what we spent on the project, so nothing IMHO was
<br>
wasted.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Now imagine, Kennedy would have said &quot;I believe that this nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out, of developing a microchip, capable to calculate the income
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tax of all citizens of this country in less then five minutes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hm. Well, nice idea... See, you can't motivate millions of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the promise of a smart toaster or a speaking VCR. 
</em><br>
<p><p>But he didn't have that idea, no one did at the time. The head of
<br>
IBM thought the whole country needed only a couple of
<br>
mainframes....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Kennedy knew this: &quot;No single space project in this period will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to accomplish.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The expense has been recouped by orders of magnitude.
<br>
<p>He may have been wrong about other things, but he was damn right
<br>
about that.
