<p><em>    &gt; previous US involvement in Afghanistan has certainly contributed

</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;This suggests that risk assessment was faulty
</em><br>
<p>Not if the alternative was worse. At the time America's opponent was the
<br>
USSR an empire that had in the previous 50 years made a pact with Hitler,
<br>
murdered tens of millions of its own citizens, let millions more starve to
<br>
death because of a foolish agricultural ideology, and put millions more in
<br>
concentration camps for reasons like saying what you really think to somebody
<br>
you thought of as a friend, being Jewish, and for no reason at all.
<br>
Oh yes I almost forgot, they also had 50,000 thermonuclear bombs with the
<br>
names of American cities on them. I would asses that risk as rather high.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and suggests that at least as much attention should be paid to long
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;term outcomes as short term gain.
</em><br>
<p>I strongly disagree, especially in foreign relations because short term
<br>
consequences can usually be predicted at least approximately but long
<br>
term it's pure speculation; ask two experts and you'll get three opinions.
<br>
Our goal should be to kill as many terrorists as we can in the next 6 months
<br>
and disrupt their network so they don't crash another airliner into a
<br>
building. What outcome this will produce two decades from now nobody
<br>
known and nobody can know.
