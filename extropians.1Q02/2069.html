<p>I believe (although I don't practice as much as I would like) in early

adoption of technology. Hanging on to the old for security reasons just
<br>
addresses the symptoms of the issue, not the cause.
<br>
<p>Can't you find a more modern calculator that does the same job as the old
<br>
one, plus more? Assuming that you can but choose not to, why would you not
<br>
want to use more advanced calculator features?
