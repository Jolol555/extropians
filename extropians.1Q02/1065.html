<em>&gt; &gt;The Red Cross is giving assistance to such people for the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time in their history.  In previous disasters, they also refused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to provide assistance to such partners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Red Cross? Are you sure about this?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I am sure about this.  Just to clarify, I am talking about withholding
<br>
financial assistance to gay surviving partners of the victims.  I am not
<br>
talking about withholding medical treatment from the injured.
<br>
<p>They provide assistance to the family of survivors, not just to the injured.
<br>
In previous disasters, they did not recognize unmarried partners as
<br>
&quot;family&quot;.  However, in this case, New York has a law that requires domestic
<br>
same-sex partners receive the same benefits as married heterosexual couples.
<br>
Because of this law, the Red Cross lawyers decided that it might be illegal
<br>
to treat gay partners differently than married partners.  This was a change
<br>
in policy.  They had never extended aid to same-sex domestic partners
<br>
before.
<br>
<p>Part of the reason was rumored to be the sheer number of gay partners in
<br>
this case.  Because of the high death toll, they were facing hundreds of gay
<br>
partners.  They did not want to refuse them all at once.  Also, New York and
<br>
the WTC companies worked together to get aid for the victims.  Because of
<br>
the New York law, they included gay partners in the list of survivors they
<br>
gave to the Red Cross.  The Red Cross had never faced such a large number of
<br>
gay survivors all at once, nor had the requests come from government
<br>
officials or large corporations before.  They were already under scrutiny
<br>
for diverting some WTC donations into their general fund, and did not want
<br>
to generate more controversy by refusing to assist all the people on the
<br>
survivor's lists.
