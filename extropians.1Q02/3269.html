<p>
Well, my grandfather died this morning at 11 am. He was a week short of
<br>
his 89th birthday. I'm not too put out, since he's been suffering from
<br>
alzheimers for several years and has been nearly catatonic for the past
<br>
year or so, so its already been a long greiving process. This follows
<br>
his wife dying this past fall at age 85. I now have one grandmonster
<br>
left, my fathers mother, who is the oldest and most active. She'll be
<br>
turning 90 this year, yet still manages several rounds of golf a week as
<br>
well as dancing, bridge, and is currently dating two fellows...
<br>
<p>I just heard of gramps' death this past minute as mom arrived with the
<br>
news, but this morning I decided to bite the bullet and sign up for
<br>
cryonic suspension with Alcor.
<br>
<p>I've been meaning to do this for a while now, since Sasha Chislenko died
<br>
(Steve Witham and I decided then to do it), but the past years economic
<br>
circumstances have prevented me from taking action on this. Now that I'm
<br>
working again, I decided to send off for the info package from Alcor,
<br>
emailed Rudi Hoffman this morning to arrange the life insurance.
<br>
<p>I'm also taking a lesson from the statistics of the situation. Grampa
<br>
Lorrey died at 69 from a heart attack from a life of smoking. Grampy and
<br>
Nan Burnett died in their 80's IMHO rather dismally after becoming less
<br>
and less active as they got older. Grandma Lorrey is still going strong
<br>
at 90 and is the most active of the bunch. Since her father lived to 99
<br>
I expect there is a longevity gene in there as well.
<br>
<p>As attendees of Extro5 probably noticed, I'm not in very good physical
<br>
shape. Working with computers for years now has certainly impacted my
<br>
formerly fit physique. I did buy a mountain bike last year, but I've
<br>
slacked off on using it, and I haven't had the funds this winter to
<br>
engage in the sport which I've been most active in the past, skiing. So
<br>
I've decided to get back in shape as well. This will be a lot of work,
<br>
and I hope all my friends take the time to occasionally tell me to get
<br>
my lard ass off the computer out to exercise.
<br>
<p>Sitting around waiting for the nano-santa isn't going to cut it. I'm 34
<br>
now, so I'd have to see the singularity by 2045 or else off myself for
<br>
cryosuspension to avoid onset of alzheimers. Despite the best optimism
<br>
of some, I think that this is still cutting it a little close. I'd like
<br>
another 20 years leeway just in case. In this respect, I think investing
<br>
1/20th of my time in getting 4/10ths more life is a sound investment. An
<br>
ROI of about 8 to 1. The cryo-policy is a good backup plan to this.
<br>
<p>Writing online will still be a big part of my life extension plan, since
<br>
studies have shown that those who engage in complex writing longer delay
<br>
the onset of alzheimers as well. 
<br>
