<p>Building new roads is very expensive at least in inner cities, so
<br>
unless the software system gets very complex and expensive it would be
<br>
worth it - at least to the drivers. In the current situation there is
<br>
less incentive for the politicians controlling the roads to make them
<br>
more efficient.
<br>
<p>Besides, extra bandwidth does not always decrease the time it takes to
<br>
get anywhere. The Braess Paradox can complicate things:

I talked about this kind of market-based approaches to traffic planning
<br>
with a friend who is a politician involved in a lot of technical
<br>
planning in my area (he and his friends are essentially playing SimCity
<br>
with it :-). He told me there is already quite a bit of adaptivity in
<br>
many traffic lights here, although this is more like my original
<br>
proposal of having the lights react to where the bigger queues are.
<br>
According to him (too) the system might not benefit significantly with
<br>
an even cleverer lights algorithm. Still, he is looking at it from the
<br>
traffic throughput side, and not at the value to each driver. After all,
<br>
a traffic flow with slightly less efficient throughput but where people
<br>
arrive more commensurate with their perceived needs would increase the
<br>
overall utility.
