<p><p>Again, as I tried to show in my paper, humanism is *not* a bolt on to
<br>
transhumanism in the same way a socialist transhumanism or a satanist

transhumanism would be.
<br>
<p>### Satanist transhumanism really is an intriguing idea. I bet there are
<br>
people out there who would love to grow horns and hooves ;-)
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p>### Just to comment on the &quot;central meme&quot; of transhumanism, the idea that
<br>
technology should and will be used to radically change human minds and
<br>
bodies - I do think that it is a significant ideological breakthrough, a
<br>
very large mental step for any human or society. As such it deserves a
<br>
suitably exalted name. While I sympathize with your interpretation of the
<br>
*natural* values which should underlie transhumanism, I think that we could
<br>
play the naming game differently.
<br>
<p>As Fabio suggested, we could abandon the use of the word &quot;transhumanism&quot; to
<br>
signify a world-view, instead use it to describe the attitude towards
<br>
technology, the central meme in pure form. It's useful to have a term to
<br>
describe this attitude in separation from the ethical systems in which it
<br>
might be embedded, since it allows the formation of temporary goal-oriented
<br>
coalitions with groups which do not share a long-range outlook (you can
<br>
still exclude nazis, though, not because they are &quot;un-transhuman&quot; but
<br>
because they are nazi). Thus transhumanist goals could be better advanced by
<br>
appealing to a larger number of persons, and only later, as we get closer to
<br>
achieving our goals, could the specific flavors of transhumanism be sorted
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>The ethical and philosophical ideas which you advocate (and with which I
<br>
fully agree), could be referred to as extropianism (to a good
<br>
approximation), or humanist transhumanism.
<br>
<p>In the end, we are not really arguing about ideas here but rather which
<br>
words should be used to describe which idea. The  naming scheme which is
<br>
most intuitve and easiest to use without confusion, should win.
<br>
