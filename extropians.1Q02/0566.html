<p>
I am not sure why the content of this particular article is so
<br>
important, but as I've read it I'll add one comment.
<br>
<p>The paper 1) stresses the libertarian aspect of Extropianism in a
<br>
somewhat negative way, 2) introduces WTA as a more open and
<br>
&quot;reasonable&quot; (= liberal democratic) platform, 3) finally presents at
<br>
length fascist versions of transhumanism.
<br>
<p>The fascist versions are introduced through an alleged obvious
<br>
conceptual link with Extropianism. I quote from the paper :
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, when a social movement emerges such as the Extropians, which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openly scorns liberal democracy, calls for an ubermenschlich elite
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to free themselves from traditional morality and pursue boundless
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expansion and optimism, and advocates the creation of a new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humanity through genetic technology and the merging of humans with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machines, it is *understandable* that critics would associate the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movement with European fascism. [my emphasis]
<br>
<p>Understandable ? Sure. Many errors are understandable. But I think a
<br>
responsible writer should assess whether such association is correct
<br>
or is an error, and to do so, he should clearly point out, not only
<br>
similarities (making the hasty association &quot;understandable&quot;), but also
<br>
the radical and essential differences (making the association an
<br>
error). This is absent, or at least given insufficient weight in the
<br>
paper.
<br>
<p>When I had my first mental contact with the Extropy movement, by
<br>
reading the Extro Principles, the &quot;Open society&quot; element in the
<br>
principles (the one that relates to libertarianism) appeared very
<br>
important to me. Why ? Not because I already was a self-proclaimed
<br>
libertarian. I was not, and still am not. In fact, living in France, I
<br>
didn't even know the word &quot;libertarianism&quot;. No -- they seemed
<br>
important to me because they asserted strongly the RESPECT of the
<br>
freedom of everyone. This intuitively sounded to me as the best
<br>
guarantee that such technologies could be developped without too much
<br>
risk of a nightmarish future.
<br>
<p>Libertarianism is not simply about being free to do anything ; it is
<br>
also about preserving the freedom of the others. In fact it is one and
<br>
the same thing. This is why it's so important here.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Open society&quot; principle of Extropian is about making possible the
<br>
development of such technologies and its free and responsible use,
<br>
while stressing the importance of respecting the freedom of all,
<br>
including those not interested in such pursuits.
<br>
<p>How farther can you get from fascism ? (see also quotes below)
<br>
Social-democracy is in fact conceptually and potentially closer to
<br>
fascism. Someone could write a paper similar to this one, but
<br>
suggesting instead that WTA still shows no clear guarantee to avoid
<br>
such risk, while Extropy has taken care of that on the
<br>
principle-level.
<br>
<p>So it might be that Max More simply got this right. Now it happens
<br>
that libertarianism as a political opinion is marginal. So there is an
<br>
&quot;acceptance&quot; problem. So (or at least it is part of the reason), you
<br>
have the WTA strategy, so that people of different political
<br>
convictions (or people without such convictions, but who associate
<br>
negative connotations to libertarianism), can get involved without
<br>
feeling they are forced into political ideas they don't feel attracted
<br>
to.
<br>
<p>I think both are fine and can coexist and strive to the same ends.
<br>
(And that the pro-WTA and anti-Extropy polemic conducted in the
<br>
article is therefore not very productive.)
<br>
<p>But I also think that the specific tenets of Extropy might happen to
<br>
be the right ones, the less risky, the most respectful of everyone. It
<br>
is probably justified to hold on on these things if they are felt to
<br>
be true, rather than dilute them to try to rally more people. The
<br>
challenges are so great that if someone can think something through,
<br>
then in the &quot;long&quot; term this will be precious, and should not be
<br>
sacrificed for the sake of immediate popularity.
<br>
<p>To conclude, here are quotes from the Extropian principles, in the
<br>
&quot;Open Society&quot; principle, in which anyone can see for himself or
<br>
herself that Extropianism is radically and essentially exclusive with
<br>
any kind of fascism. You don't have to trust the people about their
<br>
secret motives and interpretation. The PRINCIPLES are explicitely
<br>
exclusive with any kind of fascism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excerpts from Extropian Principles - Open Society
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/ideas/principles.html#5">http://www.extropy.org/ideas/principles.html#5</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose self-proclaimed and involuntarily imposed &quot;authorities&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we are skeptical of coercive political solutions,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unquestioning obedience to leaders, and inflexible hierarchies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that smother initiative and intelligence. (...)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extropians avoid utopian plans for &quot;the perfect society&quot;, instead
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appreciating the diversity in values, lifestyle preferences, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approaches to solving problems. In place of the static perfection
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a utopia, we prefer an &quot;extropia&quot; -- simply an open, evolving
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;framework allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institutions and social forms they prefer. Even where we find some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those choices mistaken or foolish, we affirm the value of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system that allows all ideas to be tried with the consent of those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involved.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no use for the technocratic idea of coercive central
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control by self-proclaimed experts. No group of experts can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand and control the endless complexity of an economy and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;society composed of other individuals like themselves. Unlike
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;utopians of all stripes, Extropians do not seek to control the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;details of people's lives or the forms and functions of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institutions according to a grand over-arching plan. Since we all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live in society, we are deeply concerned with its improvement. But
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that improvement must respect the individual. Social engineering
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be piecemeal as we enhance institutions one by one on a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voluntary basis, not through a centrally planned coercive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation of a single vision. We seek continually to improve
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;social institutions and economic mechanisms. Yet we recognize the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficulties in improving complex systems. We are radical in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intent but cautious in approach, being aware that alterations to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complex systems bring unintended consequences. Simultaneous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experimentation with numerous possible solutions and improvements
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- social parallel processing -- works better than utopian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centrally administered technocracy.
<br>
