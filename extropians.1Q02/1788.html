<p>I feel like I'm missing something.  Why do you say &quot;assuming Alcor will
<br>
accept&quot;?  Is there some question about that?  And then &quot;Hopefully, they will
<br>
stick to the list.&quot;  What's up with that?  This sounds like you expect some
<br>
kind of bait-and-switch from Alcor.  Am I mis-reading this or is there an
<br>
incident that should be more widely known?
