<p>
A few more thoughts on politics, if I may…
<br>
<p>There is a business-speak term, which I cannot remember, for the situation 
<br>
where a small company with a novel product or service is not the one to reap 
<br>
the full benefits of its own innovativity. Bigger, older, more established 
<br>
companies swoop-in once they realise the potential of the innovation and 
<br>
succeed in making it a commercial success thanks to their established 
<br>
networks, organisation, etc.
<br>
<p>It’s quite possible that transhumanists will, one day, find themselves in 
<br>
the position of that small company… (of course, this refers to the central 
<br>
meme  of transhumanism – let’s call it CMT for short – i.e. it is right to 
<br>
use technology to improve on Homo Sapiens).
<br>
<p>All developed societies have a political arena organised along a 
<br>
centre-left/centre-right divide (plus various appendages). These are the 
<br>
bigger, older, more established political entities that might, one day, 
<br>
approriate the CMT.
<br>
<p>There will be splits on this subject within both sides, as there are now on 
<br>
a number of issues (also, significant sections will be *against* the CMT); 
<br>
one side might be marginally more open to adopt it than the other; different 
<br>
interpretations of it will appear, but at the end, the centre will win (as 
<br>
it always does under normal circumstances in a democracy) and a common-sense 
<br>
implementation of the CMT will become the norm (that is, unless the 
<br>
religious/biological fundamentalists prevail and conquer the centre).
<br>
<p>Our political goal, then, should be to make sure the political centre-ground 
<br>
comes to absorb and accept the CMT, within the existing framework of liberal 
<br>
democracy.
<br>
<p>It’s called going mainstream.
<br>
<p>* * *
<br>
<p>There is a risk of re-inventing the wheel here, by trying to mould our 
<br>
awareness of future technological possibilities onto existing political 
<br>
ideologies (no transhumanist is promoting any wholly novel *political* idea, 
<br>
as far as I can see).
<br>
<p>Furhtermore, we risk putting off potential CMT supporters by espousing 
<br>
minority political views (they must be minority views for some reason, after 
<br>
all...)
<br>
<p>Am I proposing an apolitical form of transhumanism, then?
<br>
<p>Quite the opposite: I am proposing he introdution of the CMT on the centre 
<br>
stage of politics and its acceptance by all sides to the point that it is 
<br>
taken for granted.
<br>
<p>In other words, the CMT-transhumanisation of all political thought.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
