<p>
A couple years ago, I signed up for a Hushmail account. Hushmail.com
<br>
purports to provide the 'easiest, most secure encrypted email on the
<br>
internet'. Everything seemed fine with them until earlier in 2001, when
<br>
they upgraded their system to version 2.0, whereupon I was unable to
<br>
access my account, apparently due to some java errors in their system
<br>
(i.e. I've tried to access them through numerous computers and
<br>
dialup/broadband accounts of other people). After repeated and numerous
<br>
queries, questions, demands, and threats, they have NEVER responded to
<br>
any emails sent regarding this problem. The last email I sent them
<br>
warned if I did not receive a response that I would do my utmost to
<br>
utterly destroy their reputation across the internet (assuming there is
<br>
anything left to destroy). It has since been two weeks since that
<br>
warning, so I assume that I am now free to lay waste to the name of
<br>
Hushmail. If anyone on the list has anything meaningful to contribute to
<br>
contest this, please let me know. If anyone on the list knows anyone at
<br>
hushmail and can open a line of meaningful communication, please do.
<br>
Otherwise, carpetbombing (metaphorically) of the land of Hush will
<br>
commence at 1500 hrs EST tomorrow.
