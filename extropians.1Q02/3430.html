</em><br>
<p><p>The Colorado river water basin is a good example of the problem of poor
<br>
freshwater utilization, though in a more complex and political sense than
<br>
merely dumping it into the ocean.  In the case of the Colorado river, the
<br>
desert States view it as an essential and critical resource as they depend
<br>
on it almost by necessity.  California depends on it mostly in the sense
<br>
that it is cheap and convenient for California, though that state has many
<br>
potential freshwater resources at its disposal.
<br>
<p>By legal treaty in 1922, both the States of Arizona and Nevada (among
<br>
others) have substantial water rights along the Colorado river basin, as
<br>
does California.  A problem is emerging in that California has been taking
<br>
FAR more water, to the tune of several million foot-acres (1 foot-acre ~=
<br>
1.2 million liters), out of the basin than it has been legally entitled to
<br>
for many decades and has in fact become dependent on it as a source of
<br>
cheap/free water.  Nevada and Arizona have overlooked this fact for some
<br>
time because they weren't actually drawing their full allotment and were
<br>
letting the water flow on through to California.
<br>
<p>Fast forward to the late 1990's, after a couple decades of sustained growth
<br>
and population booms in Nevada and Arizona. (For those interested, the State
<br>
of Nevada has sustained an average 5% annual population growth for decades,
<br>
the highest in the nation, due primarily to an intentionally favorable
<br>
economic climate; everything is cheap, taxes are comparatively non-existent,
<br>
and regulatory red tape is kept to a bare minimum.  Not bad for a State that
<br>
most people think of as a desert wasteland.)  First Arizona, and then Nevada
<br>
start asserting their rights to the water in the Colorado river basin to
<br>
feed their growing cities (e.g. Las Vegas, which has grown explosively),
<br>
since that region of both States literally have no substantial aquifers or
<br>
water sources except the Colorado river.  California then goes ballistic and
<br>
wants to continue using the cheap water they've enjoyed for ages despite the
<br>
fact that California entered in a legal treaty that guarantees them no more
<br>
than a certain amount of water will travel downstream.  A political mess
<br>
ensues.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure where I was going with that, but freshwater distribution is
<br>
among the biggest factors of where populations can viably concentrate.
<br>
California has vast water resources within the state, controlling almost the
<br>
entire Pacific Coastal Water Basin, but have managed the distribution and
<br>
usage of it relatively poorly.  People in California don't live where the
<br>
water is, and prefer to tap the easily accessible water supplies of the
<br>
desert States to their east which have no other alternative.  One of the
<br>
problems is that the political system often wants to bend resource
<br>
allocation to fit political desires rather than produce the most efficient
<br>
utilization.  Even the deep desert States could enjoy relatively high
<br>
population densities if the freshwater resources were managed efficiently.
<br>
Unfortunately, there is a tendency to manage such resources politically
<br>
instead.
<br>
<p>When I was stating that North America could support 2 billion people without
<br>
straining the environment, I was assuming sane resource management.  Even a
<br>
harsh desert State like Nevada could sustainably support around 10 million
<br>
people on its own resources and most regions of the United States (never
<br>
mind Canada and Mexico) could support far higher population densities.  I'm
<br>
not suggesting that we pave the continent with suburbia, just that vastly
<br>
higher efficiencies could be achieved in resource management if politics
<br>
wasn't skewing the economics so severely.  North America is barely using
<br>
some of its resources and wasting most of the rest through inefficiency.
<br>
<p>Fresh water is an interesting example because the legal tradition east of
<br>
the Rocky Mountains is that fresh water is infinite in supply.  West of the
<br>
Rocky Mountains, and particularly in the intermountain regions, the legal
<br>
tradition has always treated water as a very finite commodity.  I think in
<br>
some ways the West has handled this much better than the East, in part
<br>
because the West has not had to overturn a couple centuries of legal
<br>
assumptions.
