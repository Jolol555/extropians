<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I don't get sick at the sight of blood, so I'll probably do

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least today, that's a bad option because it's general policy for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coroner or ME to do a very invasive autopsy in cases of suicide--partly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule out foul play. Catch-22.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps this will change with the times.
</em><br>
<p>Insurance companies also have something to say about that; some
<br>
will indeed pay in the case of suicide (with some exclusions), but
<br>
many won't: read the fine print.
<br>
<p>Also, I should think the best way to go (both in terms of personal
<br>
comfort, preservation success, and legal problems) would be to call
<br>
Alcor, set up the video camera to record your final wishes and the
<br>
act itself, slide into a bathtub full of ice water and shoot up a
<br>
fatal dose of Morphine and Heparin.  Wrist-slashing is so messy...
