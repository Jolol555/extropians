<em>&gt; Actually, there are quite a few organizations taking similar approaches,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the most advanced of the lot; they have a good chance of being the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; milestone).
</em><br>
<p>One of the &quot;win&quot; criteria in our business plan is if there are several
<br>
vehicle makers (possibly including us) who use our propulsion.  This is
<br>
part of the reason why we haven't entered the X-prize competition- we
<br>
want to sell engines to all comers (subject to State Department
<br>
paranoia, of course).  We're negotiating contracts/making proposals to a
<br>
whole bunch of prospective customers.  Future's so bright, I gotta wear
<br>
sunglasses.
<br>
<p>Highlights of yesterday's flight-
<br>
<p>* Mike Melvill putting the &quot;chase&quot; into chase pilot, passing 20 feet
<br>
over my head at 160 kts 15 seconds after Dick lit the engines, the warm
<br>
exhaust still washing around me...
<br>
<p>* Hightailing it off the runway after I realized, &quot;Oops, it's a touch
<br>
and go flight, he's not gonna be eight minutes coming down,&quot; as the
<br>
planes turned onto final...
<br>
<p>* Dick showing impeccable glideslope management, setting it down just 80
<br>
feet past the numbers...
<br>
<p>* Frustration at the *&amp;^%$ ignition interlock switches being too cold
<br>
and operating sluggishly, forcing an unnecessary engine relight abort
<br>
and preventing the &quot;go&quot; part of the touch and go. (We'll have two fixes
<br>
built and tested before the next flight- this has only been a problem
<br>
during the recent cold weather.  Next month we'll have our own custom
<br>
design switches built &amp; installed; smaller, lighter, and more reliable.)
<br>
<p>All in all, I really enjoy my job.
