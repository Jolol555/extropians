<p>A lot of Singularity tech is about autonomous, adaptive fabbing, on all
<br>
scales. One of the critical components is a sensor-actuator coordination
<br>
loop, a subsystem for robust, adaptive realtime control. It could be a
<br>
pipeline, but the control loop must be not deeper than 20 ms, or less,
<br>
while processing quite complex stimuli. If you look at this in terms of
<br>
conventional machine vision, you will have trouble even pushing around two
<br>
megapixels worth of stereo frame buffer, even not mentioning processing,
<br>
especially complex processing.
<br>
<p>So there is a very real hardware problem, namely that 2 GOPS of braindead
<br>
sequential operations don't do you a lot of good, if you have to use a lot
<br>
of them under realtime constraints. And remember, you never, ever may lose
<br>
tracking, or you're wrecking the entire fab, including setup time (a
<br>
single shuttle worth of wafers in a fab is worth 20 M$, and it can take
<br>
*days* for the process to settle in).
<br>
<p>Things become even more difficult, if you want to grow that algorithm,
<br>
since you would have to resort to an emulation layer which can easily eat
<br>
up two orders of magnitude of performance, because your native hardware
<br>
layer is allergic to mutation.
<br>
<p>So, don't assume hardware is a given. It isn't.
