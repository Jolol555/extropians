From: &quot;James Rogers&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jamesr@best.com?Subject=Re:%20Jaron%20Lanier%20Got%20Up%20My%20Shnoz%20on%20AI">jamesr@best.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; My point was that all programs expressible on a parallel system are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressible on a single processor system.
</em><br>
<p>Since no one has tried &quot;all programs&quot; (all programs haven't been devised yet)
<br>
on a single processor system, we cannot yet know if all programs (including
<br>
the human brain's parrallel system expressed programs) can be expressed on a
<br>
single processor system. In fact, the human brain's programs have not been
<br>
fully expressed in *any* system, whether single or parallel processor type.
<br>
So, we can't know (yet) if the human brain's programs require a parallel
<br>
system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Magic doesn't happen when n&gt;&gt;1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more than when n=2 (where &quot;n&quot; is the number of processors) compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you only have a single processor.
</em><br>
<p>So it would seem. Nevertheless, the proof is in the pudding, and until a
<br>
single processing system successfully expresses the entire gamut of the human
<br>
brain's programs, there is no empirical evidence to support the contention
<br>
that it can do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can't do sentience on a serial processor, massive parallelism won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help you in a meaningful way, other than potentially giving a bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing power of a largely uninteresting sort.
</em><br>
<p>In his book, _Afterthought, The Computer Challenge to Human Intelligence_,
<br>
James Bailey disagrees with your statement:
<br>
&quot;More interesting than random numbers, however, are the computational
<br>
potentials of entities like neurons and chromosomes. Clearly, these mechanisms
<br>
have accomplished much over time. Large arrays of neurons, for example, are
<br>
able to recognize patterns in ways that no geometric or algebraic formulations
<br>
can. Unfortunately, it can take them years to learn how. The same is true of
<br>
the genetic recombination of chromosomes.
<br>

<br>
Wondrous results have emerged, but over millions of years. Neither were viable
<br>
candidates for computing before computing became electronic. Now, more and
<br>
more scientists are heeding the advice of the physicist Stanislaw Ulam: &quot;Ask
<br>
not what mathematics can do for biology. Ask what biology can do for
<br>
mathematics.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Add as many mail coaches as you please, you will never get a railroad by so
<br>
doing.&quot;
<br>
--Schumpeter
<br>
<p>I think we will get human-level pattern recognition in machine intelligence
<br>
via a partnership of sequential human brains and autonomous parallel
<br>
electronic circuits, because discursive symbolism alone does not equate to
<br>
human-competitive intellectual activity.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
