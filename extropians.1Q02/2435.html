<em>&gt; I can't speak for your country, but in the U.S. your assumptions would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply be wrong.  Nearly all the wealthy people in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country are entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-made, and the majority of those achieved wealth as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blue-collar workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who were not born into the vaguest semblance of privilege.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; square with popular perception, but it is in fact the truth.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into &quot;the richer classes&quot; as you are painting them are almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a non-existent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class here and largely irrelevant as they are vastly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outnumbered by more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;deserving&quot; folk of similar economic means.
