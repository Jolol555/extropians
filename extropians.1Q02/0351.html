<em>&gt; &gt; Imagine that you make a big hit with such a game. Suddenly most young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people are equipped with the right concepts, and the habit to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dynamically about these things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Make it accessible on the Internet, as a Java application or as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; downloable software, so that anyone can play the legislator and have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; look at how things evolves. &quot;Make social justice if you can !&quot; Make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Better yet make it a multiplayer game, replacing much of the simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decisions by decisions actually made by the human players in the given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; context, and making the experience much more convincing. Any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggestion ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a great idea. Go have a look at A Tale in The Desert for an example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a MMORPG in development (closed alpha) that focuses on cooperative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule-based societal development. Ground is already being broken...

<p><p>I had a look at this, thanks for the pointer.
<br>
<p>It looks nice, but it's not what we need.
<br>
<p>Giving a bit more thought to it, I think that you could make a game
<br>
the very appeal of which would be the proximity of the game society
<br>
with the actual society. The incentive to play would be to try out
<br>
ideas one may have about desirable reforms, etc., and even
<br>
demonstrating their desirability through the game experience.
<br>
<p>Such an incentive is real and would, if the game focuses on the right
<br>
aspects, bring lots of players to it. How many people write long posts
<br>
on mailing lists about desirable reforms, etc. Some of this energy
<br>
would be put into the game. INstead of producing endless contradictory
<br>
dialogues, it would product effects in a parallel world, for everyone
<br>
to analyze and reflect about.
<br>
<p>It could become a sort of inspiration for the real society. Big
<br>
reforms and decisions made in the game would be announced in the real
<br>
newspapers, as attention on the game unfolding would have accumulated,
<br>
because of its realism and consequent relevance.
<br>
<p>The game world would integrate people of various countries and even
<br>
languages, just as the real world. Most of it would not be
<br>
&quot;modelized&quot;, it would just consist of the real people making real
<br>
decisions. There would be no prefixed plot unfolding, like in &quot;A tale
<br>
in the desert&quot;. Just occasional resets.
<br>
<p>When people get bored with one particular world, they could create
<br>
another one. But the zero state would always, by principle, reflect
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>People in RL would refer some individuals to specific parts of the
<br>
game to learn real skills, or test their abilities. RL and the game
<br>
would fruitfully interact, and feed each other.
<br>
<p>I think it could be so much fun and interest that I'm sure it will
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>The main idea is : make the game attractive BECAUSE it is close to
<br>
real society, so that if you manage to do something in the game you
<br>
may convince people to do it in the real society. It is this &quot;real
<br>
stake&quot; that would make the game sexy (instead of the thrill of
<br>
fighting, or the fantasy and cultural interest).
<br>
<p>And incidentally, this would help many people to develop better
<br>
political thinking.
<br>
