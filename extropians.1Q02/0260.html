<em>&gt; I guess you just want the last word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but asking is not the way to get it, you have to earn. You earn it by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing that everybody is wrong except you.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, anyone with a bit of judgment will give you the &quot;last word&quot;
<br>
almost immediately after you have started repeating yourself, or
<br>
systematically misunderstanding his arguments.
<br>
<p>So it may well be that, in an environment of people with judgment,
<br>
&quot;having the last word&quot; on something only means people don't care to
<br>
discuss it further with you. (ANd if people recognize that you are
<br>
right as a result of the discussion, THEY will end the discussion by
<br>
saying so.)
<br>
<p>When discussion pointlessly goes on, it doesn't mean anything, except
<br>
that some people can't resist the temptation to send one more post
<br>
(whether it has any new content and is still of any interest to
<br>
anyone in any way, or not), and don't care about the list members --
<br>
or vastly misunderstand the image they project by doing so.
<br>
<p>What you have to earn is not to have the last word : it is that
<br>
someone with a working brain take the time and attention to write a
<br>
thoughtful reply to your post (vs. getting a thought-free post from a
<br>
compulsive poster). And you earn this, not by being right, but by
<br>
writing thoughtful posts.
