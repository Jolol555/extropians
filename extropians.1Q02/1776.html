From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20We're%20stuck%20with%20each%20other">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You are talking about entirely different realms here.  One is nanoscale,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other is macroscale.  You seem to not be seeing what many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see which is that biotechnology *IS* nanotechnology.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current business plan is on how to make robust bio-nanotechnology
</em><br>
available
<br>
<em>&gt; to large numbers of molecular biologists within *this* decade.
</em><br>
<p>That is an entire area I have not considered.  I was thinking of machine
<br>
robots.  I thought you were comparing machines we build today to the
<br>
efficiency of biology.  I should have read you more literally.  Bio-tech IS
<br>
the way to go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you might want to either (a) consider accepting the opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the people who have studied this; or (b) educate yourself about it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so you can evaluate the probabilities based on your own knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Both sound like good options  (I don't have much time.  I may just ask
<br>
Harvey.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look at Linux!  Its effectively free.
</em><br>
<p>As a Linux supporter, I bow to your excellent example, and concede the
<br>
point.  (After all, open source only takes ONE philanthropist to make it
<br>
available.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is because the numbers don't add up.  Even if all the billions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all the billionaires in the world adds up to $600 billion, divided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over ~6 billion people, thats $100/person.  Not enough to feed them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for very long.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Perhaps the failure of rich people to feed the poor is more the fault
<br>
of ability than motivation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have ~40 trillion bacteria in or on your body. Many of them are E.
</em><br>
coli.
<br>
<em>&gt; The doubling time for E. coli is ~20 minutes.  If, as I said, you provided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them with access to sufficient energy and raw materials, they would
</em><br>
outmass
<br>
<em>&gt; your body in less than a day.  Eukaryotic cells in contrast have a
</em><br>
doubling
<br>
<em>&gt; time of ~24 hours.
</em><br>
<p>You are right.  My (relative) ignorance of biology is showing.  I didn't
<br>
consider my body as a limited food supply.
<br>
<p><p><p>I wil concede the points on the molecular manipulation, and the &quot;free
<br>
energy&quot;.  Once I realized that you were talking bio-tech rather than
<br>
mecha-tech, molecular manipulation is a lot easier.  (As I said, I was
<br>
assuming building microscopic robots.  That technology is very far away.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I can design one first, I'll be happy to give you one on the condition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you give one to anyone who asks for one.  Oh, and you and anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you give them to will have to pay me a small royalty for any income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you derive from them.
</em><br>
<p>You just stepped away from Linux's open source model.  However, for this
<br>
kind of technology, I don't think I mind.
