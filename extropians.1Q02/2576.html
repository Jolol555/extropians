<p>
Actually, this could be simply the power of the human subconscious at work.
<br>
Traffic lights are easy to predict.  They have repeatable patterns.  My
<br>
business partner always complains when we get to a light at the wrong time
<br>
of the cycle.  He knows which light will go next, whether the crosswalks
<br>
will go or not this time, and whether cars are on the trip-switches or not.
<br>
He predicts this stuff very easily because he has noticed the patterns and
<br>
drives through them all the time.
<br>
<p>He doesn't know exactly when he noticed this.  He didn't consciously study
<br>
or memorize the patterns.  His subconscious mind figured these patterns out
<br>
over years of experience in this neighborhood.  I have no doubt in my mind
<br>
that before he consciously was aware that he knew all the patterns, he was
<br>
subconsciously or partially aware.  He probably felt like he had good
<br>
timing, or felt like he was probably going to run late.  I believe that a
<br>
lot of psychic powers are easily explainable by simple patterns that are
<br>
easy to predict.  However, the human mind does a lot of this processing
<br>
behind the scenes where we are not consciously aware of doing it.  Our mind
<br>
analyzes the patterns and pops up the right answer without us knowing
<br>
exactly how.
<br>
<p>What's more, these patterns are very easy to manipulate.  Driving faster or
<br>
slower between lights can easily influence whether you hit the next light on
<br>
a red or a green.  Even easier than that is the fact that cars around you
<br>
get grouped into clumps that are delayed at red lights and allowed through
<br>
together at green lights.  For each road, it is easy to figure out if the
<br>
speed limit hits all the greens (on streets with well-timed lights), or
<br>
whether the timing is off.  If the timing is off, it is easy to go faster or
<br>
slower than other cars to hit the correct timing while everyone else hits
<br>
the red lights.  Perhaps you can drive faster than everybody and breeze
<br>
through all the lights, or perhaps you can drive leisurely and have the
<br>
lights turn green before you hit them.  In either case, there are only a few
<br>
minor adjustments to figure out for each road to get into the right pattern.
<br>
<p>If the lights are timed correctly for the speed limit, or triggered
<br>
regularly for traffic flow, then it is easy to go with the flow and hit all
<br>
the green lights.  That's how the traffic engineers designed the system.
<br>
Any impatience and driving fast will hit red lights that will slow you down.
<br>
Any pokiness and driving slow will let you get caught by red lights just as
<br>
you reach an intersection.  It would not take very much for the subconscious
<br>
mind to figure out that if you relax and stop trying to hurry that you seem
<br>
to get all the green lights and breeze through faster.
<br>
<p>This is how neural nets and pattern-matching works.  Traffic lights are a
<br>
perfect example of predictable patterns that your brain absorbs every day.
<br>
I have no doubt that the subconscious pattern-matching software tries to
<br>
utilize these patterns to make driving more efficient.  This is a simply
<br>
amazing part of the human brain.  Instead of debunking such claims, I
<br>
embrace them and say that this phenomenon is surly happening.  The brain is
<br>
more powerful than we think.
<br>
<p>(I got this attitude from the great Randi, believe it or not.  I noticed
<br>
that most of his &quot;debunking&quot; of psychic claims were not the exposure of
<br>
fraud, but the simple explanation of how things were really working.  I
<br>
started noticing this myself.  Most claims are not ludicrous.  They actually
<br>
are occurring due to an explainable scientific reason.)
<br>
<p>I say that attitude and driving style obviously affects whether you get
<br>
mostly green lights or mostly red ones.  I say that it takes a genius mind
<br>
to tap into these patterns and exploit them.  Whether you call this pattern
<br>
psychic or merely psychological, the brain is getting extra information
<br>
outside the conscious awareness of the individual, and is putting that
<br>
information to work to influence the outcome of events.  Psychic people do
<br>
this all the time, but they don't consciously know how they do it.
