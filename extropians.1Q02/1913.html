<p>growth path.  Ultimately you still face the requirement for
<br>
matter compilers.  I don't think this will be feasible until
<br>
you have many high-bandwidth connections to a large fraction
<br>
of the installed computronium base -- the intelligence constraints
<br>
on low bandwidth connections between fractional human brain
<br>
equivalents seems to be a strong barrier.
<br>
<p>### In the year 1986, when I was still young, I had the idea about how to
<br>
build a light-controlled DNA synthetase (LCDS). At that time I wasn't really
<br>
thinking about AI's, I wanted to have a fast way of building GMO prototypes.
<br>
Of course, as youthfully naive as I was, I didn't realize how many orders of
<br>
magnitude of computing capacity growth would be needed to make this dream
<br>
come true, but now it appears to me that in a few years this idea's time
<br>
will come.
<br>
<p>I still have the manuscript, neatly typed on a mechanical typewriter.
<br>
Basically, you need four nucleotide carrier proteins, one for each
<br>
nucleotide, each carrier having one main subunit and four blocking units
<br>
light-sensitively attached to the main subunit. Shining light of one of four
<br>
frequencies will dissociate one of the blocking units, changing the shape of
<br>
the face of the carrier and allowing binding of the next carrier, containing
<br>
the nucleotide specified by the choice of light color. This would result in
<br>
the growth of a chain of carriers whose order would be determined by the
<br>
order of light flashes, allowing a (modified) DNA synthetase to polymerize
<br>
the nucleotides in the chain, resulting in the formation of new DNA, inside
<br>
the cell nucleus, at very high speeds, with only a very simple lab setup
<br>
(four laser diodes and a Petrie dish).
<br>
<p>An AI capable of solving the protein folding problem might have the sequence
<br>
for all the units of the LCDS in a few hours. It would take only a few days
<br>
to synthesize the DNA on a standard DNA synthesizer, and transfect into
<br>
bacteria. Only computing capacity would then limit the AI's ability to
<br>
transform the bacteria into nanomachines.
