<em>&gt; &gt;That's my point - at some point, even in a libertarian government, someone

<em>&gt; &gt;public buildings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Responsible to the public, yes.  To his own sensitivities, no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There is nothing wrong with Ashcroft taking charge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the appearance of his building.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is.  It is the peoples building, not &quot;his&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Curtains are not &quot;vandalism&quot; and he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not destroying his predecessors' efforts, just temporarily switching them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Switching them off?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sure, Ashcroft's decision may only be temporary; sure, we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;disagree with it; my point is that is that it is legitimately Ashcroft's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not so sure about the legitimacy of it  Anyone here know where the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitution stands on this?
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't. The Constitution says nothing about pornography, other than
<br>
that one of congress' functions is to promote the 'general welfare',
<br>
which can include anything which makes life enjoyable: economic
<br>
stability, art, etc. It also says that congress shall pass no law
<br>
restricting freedom of speech, though several Supreme Court decisions
<br>
have determined that 'shall pass no law' is not necessarily so absolute
<br>
as one would think (just as they seem to have difficulty understanding
<br>
&quot;Shall not be infringed&quot;). 
<br>
<p>Since art is speech, then artists can't be restricted in what art they
<br>
produce (though congress isn't required to PAY for art it doesn't like),
<br>
there is nothing in the Constitution which says that the Attorney
<br>
General has to expose to the public whatever art the left wingers think
<br>
should be on public land 24/7.
<br>
<p>The difference between art and pornography is judged to be a boundary
<br>
established by local social standards of morality and salaciousness.
<br>
Just because a Frenchwoman thinks its okay to parade around nude with
<br>
unshaven pits and legs doesn't mean that this is okay in US society.
<br>
While this leaves the boundary to be judged rather nebulous and vague,
<br>
in the words of a former SCOTUS Justice &quot;I know it (pornography) when I
<br>
see it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, the difference between artistic or scientific nudity versus
<br>
public nakedness and pornography is certainly a slippery one. On TV two
<br>
weeks ago I saw a documentary program about an african tribe, who were
<br>
quite proudly naked, breasts and all, all of the time, and this was
<br>
transmitted without the hint of a pixellated censor, yet the documentary
<br>
of Geraldo Rivera's sailing voyage around the world on the Travel
<br>
Channel, which contained the occasional shot of Geraldo diving bare
<br>
assed off the boat in the middle of the ocean, censored the
<br>
aforementioned hindquarters quite thoroughly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;How would we feel if a transhumanist Attorney General were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mocked in the media for putting a curtain over, say, a painting of God
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;judging sinners?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If he did it to a private work, he'd deserve the roasting he'd get.  If he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did it to a public work on a govt. building, then we'd have to ask why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was a religious monument there in the first place.  He'd be operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the constitution if he removed it I believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd rather see breasts on a public building than a god, but I'm a European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all :)
</em><br>
<p>I like breasts too, and don't mind seeing them anywhere, provided they
<br>
somewhat resemble my idea of attractive ones. Since gods are fictional
<br>
creatures, I am quite indifferent to them. One should only get worked up
<br>
over them if they are real.
<br>
<p>If Ashcroft does it to his own art, that's his business, though I don't
<br>
see the point of buying art (or producing it) and then covering it up.
<br>
Since we have federal laws governing decency and interstate travel for
<br>
sexual purposes (the Comstock Act, I believe), there is some precedent
<br>
for the AG making decisions about what he thinks is decency.
