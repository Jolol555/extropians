<br>
<em>&gt; and of course, evolution is not sentient,
</em><br>
<p>Would you care to defend that assertion?
<br>
<p>While I might even agree with you, one could reasonably argue
<br>
that evolution is not sentient AND it isn't even random, therefore
<br>
it's not even creative.  (If you argue that non-random acts of
<br>
creation are also creative, then mechanical clocks are also
<br>
&quot;creative&quot; when they display the time they are instructed to
<br>
keep, which is nonsensical.)
<br>
<p>At a microscopic level, evolution appears to be very chaotic
<br>
and random.  I'm talking at the level of thousands of years.
<br>
<p>At the macroscopic level (billions of years) evolution seems
<br>
to be taking a very predictable path, and one could almost
<br>
predict that in another few hundred million years, what life
<br>
on Earth may be like (even given seemingly random catastrophic
<br>
events, which are not as random as they appear to be when
<br>
examining things at a macroscopic level).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; so it's evident that creativity can function independently of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience.
</em><br>
<p>It's also evident that where sentience is absence, what appears
<br>
to pass for creativity may not actually be creativity, merely
<br>
the action of creation.  Creativity implies (to me) an external
<br>
influence that affects the product that is created.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this illustrates the difference between the technical
<br>
definition of creativity versus what the lay-person takes
<br>
the word creativity to mean.  A lay-person would find it very
<br>
difficult to agree that a mechanical clock telling the time
<br>
(a machine which creates a representation of a numerical value
<br>
that has meaning to an observer) as posessing creativity.
<br>
<p>Worse, lay-people would find it very hard to agree that a
<br>
robot in an automobile manufacturing plant, &quot;creating&quot; the same
<br>
component over and over, posesses creativity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Superlative sentience (total awareness) can't be &quot;achieved,&quot; so you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have to worry about achieving it. It emerges spontaneously, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is like nothing that the brain can imagine, because it coincides with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct experience of reality, just the opposite of induced stupor.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; If sentience is easier to achieve than creativity, then sentience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally precedes creativity.  So, then what created the sentience?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, creativity precedes sentience, otherwise evolution could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never create sentience.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think sentience is easier to create than creativity, but
<br>
I don't think that creativity necessarily precedes sentience.
<br>
<p>The reason why it appears to us (humans) that it is easier to
<br>
achieve creativity than it is to achieve sentience is because
<br>
we know so very little about sentience.  I don't think that
<br>
means that sentience is actually harder to create, and I think
<br>
it's very possible that evolution simply gave us sentience
<br>
(self-awareness) and that everything else (creativity, emotions,
<br>
etc.) are simply a part of that sentience.
<br>
<p>I think until we get a much firmer grasp of what sentience
<br>
really is and what it consists of, we'll never actually produce
<br>
truly creative machines.
