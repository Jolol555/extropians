<em>&gt; Here's something that may surprise those who have never seen it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nevada is one of the most scenic states in the lower 48.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put it in the top 3.  They never sell that much in their tourist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brochures, only the gambling and legal harlotry.  But Nevada has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more to offer than that, so much more.  If you ever see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of those pictures of the US from space, notice the area which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is Nevada: mountain range after mountain range, like grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ripples on a massive sea.
</em><br>
<p>Lake Mead is very scenic, as the Playboy pictorial with Darva Conger
<br>
captured so well (hey, its Nevada, so there's gotta be sex in there
<br>
somewhere!).
<br>
<p>Northern Nevada is generally scenic in a lunar landscape sorta way,
<br>
though the Reno/Tahoe area is very nice. THere are lots of locations
<br>
with very interesting geological formations around the state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a bonus, Nevada is second only to Alaska in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being libertarian. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I'd have to dispute this statement about libertarians. NH has
<br>
had more state legislators elected from the Libertarian Party than any
<br>
other state, last I checked.
