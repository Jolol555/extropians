</em><br>
<p>Alas, we don't have anything human-readable enough to charge for.  Right now
<br>
I'm generating all the design notes I need as a preliminary to writing up
<br>
human-readable design documents.  Under the circumstances, it seems better to
<br>
try and prototype the design documents themselves before actually writing
<br>
them, as 'twere.  Goals for the design notes:  A complete outline of the
<br>
design subsystems of a general intelligence on the various levels of
<br>
organization; a grouping of the outline into major tasks to be divided up
<br>
among the programmers (or assigned one to a programmer, if we can somehow
<br>
afford to hire that many people); high-level walkthroughs of some example
<br>
cognitive processes; a list of milestones for the first few stages; a
<br>
breakdown of submilestones along the way to the first stage.  (Actually
<br>
outlining the system modules and top-level classes is something that I'd
<br>
rather do with the rest of the programming team, once the programming team has
<br>
been pulled together.)  Right now, as I said, I'm working on the formal paper,
<br>
although of course I've gone on with the design notes during that.  Currently
<br>
the design notes are about 250K in length and include a very large (and
<br>
growing) subsystem outline.  I hope to be done with the paper soon, after
<br>
which the primary task goes back to design.  The next step in growing the
<br>
subsystem outline, when the paper is done, will be to try the walkthroughs. 
<br>
When the subsystem outline is complete it'll be possible to do the
<br>
milestones.  Then comes writing it all up.  At least that's the current plan,
<br>
which is rather highly susceptible to being obsoleted by events.
