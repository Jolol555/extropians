<p>Your rant leaves out the key point that the Soviet Union

started the cycle of violence by support a COMMUNIST

puppet revolution in Afghanistan....little forgetful?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments to shell out the Bucks/Marks. Peso's whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Part of the U.S.'s problem in the world is simple PR. During the holidays
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; was watching TV as a man in Afghanistan was criticizing the U.S. with a
</em><br>
bag
<br>
<em>&gt; of wheat clearly labelled &quot;USA&quot; slung over his shoulder. Had I been

standing
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In marketspeak the US needs to push it's brand, and quit catering to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudices of the rest of the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian - to be frank your comments disturb me in their arrogance. The USA
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; dropping bombs on these people for god's sake! The USA is at least partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for the rise of the Taliban to power. The USA helped create,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; train &amp; directly funded, elements in Afghanistan that are at least partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for the terrible years of war &amp; bloodshed that the country has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endured. How many Afghanis have died as a direct result of American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies? Should the people of Afghanistan say &quot;Well the US fucked us over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the last twenty years, they helped psychotic religious nuts become our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government by giving them guns &amp; missiles, they've bombed the crap out of
</em><br>
us
<br>
<em>&gt; day &amp; night for the last few months, they killed twenty people in my
</em><br>
village
<br>
<em>&gt; by mistake last week, but now they just gave me a bag of wheat so now USA
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; A-OK&quot;. Do you really expect twenty odd years of utter bastardry to be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forgotten, just because NOW you've decided to act with SOME decency?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are people in this world who hate America &amp; America has given them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of good reasons to have that hate. If you truly want the US to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe then the US must act responsibly. It must stop its political &amp;
</em><br>
military
<br>
<em>&gt; support of terrorists (sorry, they're &quot;freedom fighters&quot; - at least they
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; until they start bombing YOU) against legitimate elected governments. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must stop its support of governments &amp; dictators that torture &amp; kill &amp; rob
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own citizens. It must stop putting the well-being of its business &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military interests above the basic human rights of other people,
</em><br>
regardless
<br>
<em>&gt; of their citizenship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will not be more security that will prevent more terrorist attacks. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not be the death of every Al Quada member that prevents more
</em><br>
terrorist
<br>
<em>&gt; attacks. It will not be facial recognition software &amp; the automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detention of every Muslim that will prevent more terrorist attacks. It
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; not be American military might that will prevent more terrorist attacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America must become responsible &amp; decent. The empty rhetoric of &quot;liberty &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice for all&quot;, the lie of &quot;the protector of freedom&quot; &amp; the &quot;champion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice&quot; must become true. America could become what the dream of America
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has always been, America can lead the world, and not just militarily or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercially but ethically as well, if only the government &amp; the people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America have the strength and courage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There can be no justification for the events of 9/11 just as there can be
</em><br>
no
<br>
<em>&gt; justification for the many atrocities &amp; crimes of convenience that have
</em><br>
been
<br>
<em>&gt; committed in America's name. The cycle of hatred has to stop somewhere or
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt; will see the events of 9/11 happening again. And again. And again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America can be more than just America the great, it could truly become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America the good, America the just, America the free, if only the nation &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's people have the courage &amp; the humility to change for the better, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give as well as receive, to heal instead of harm, to become a true leader
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The rebuilding of Afghanistan is only the first challenge, but it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important one. It is a chance for the US to show that there is more to
</em><br>
it's
<br>
<em>&gt; motives than simple revenge. It is a chance for the US to show that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise up against anger &amp; grief &amp; hatred. There was no shortage of bravery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among the fire-fighters &amp; police who risked all on 9/11 - can America the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same selfless courage as a nation?
