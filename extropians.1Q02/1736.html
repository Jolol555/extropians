Greetings !!!
<br>
I indeed live in the Netherlands.
<br>
I was born in Paris, lived in France ( Normandy in the North: cows + rain + 
<br>
more cows ... ) until the age of 8. My grandma who raised me, decided to die 
<br>
one day while I was on holidays in Senegal ( most western point in Africa. 
<br>
The capital is Dakar ). So I stayed in Senegal ( being a ping-pong ball 
<br>
between my divorced parents: dad Psychologist, mum business woman ) for 13 
<br>
years. My mum is half French/half Senegalese, her name is the name I bear. 
<br>
According to my grandfather, my name ( NDIAYE) is directly linked to the 
<br>
ruling family of kings a millennia ago. Tribe would be a mix of Wolof and  
<br>
Serere and maybe Toucouleur. In 1994 I had my A-levels or the French 
<br>
equivalent of it. I was 21, did not want to go to University. I first wanted 
<br>
to cover the war in Rwanda as a photographer. Mum said: &quot;Forget it&quot;. So I 
<br>
went to London. Lived there for a few years. Very nasty car crash in 1996, 
<br>
girlfriend was driving, her brother + g/f in the back. I am the sole 
<br>
survivor. Right lung got 'slightly' damaged, part of my knees shattered. 
<br>
Verdict: you'll live but we need to operate your lung; on the other hand,  
<br>
you will never walk again. I laughed at them. Lung got fixed, got myself some 
<br>
new cyborg(half) knees and went to spend some time with the mother of my g/f 
<br>
in some huge castle in Scotland. Private nurse team etc.... Used to wait till 
<br>
everyone was asleep, would roll in my chair (it's got wheels and you use one 
<br>
when you cannot use your legs, dunno what it's called.... oh !!!! a 
<br>
wheelchair =) to the pool outside and would throw myself in the water. 6 
<br>
weeks later, I could feel below my knees again. Two weeks more and I was 
<br>
standing up. By the end of 1997 I was given 18 months to live. Born premature 
<br>
(5 month + 28 days ), 965 grams. Right lung stopped growing when I was 13 or 
<br>
so.  It so happened that my pulmonary capacity was decreasing in a constant 
<br>
fashion. Doctors said: &quot;by mid 1998 you'll need to carry oxygen supplies on 
<br>
you. My then pregnant girlfriend swallowed 40 valiums: g/f gone, so was the 
<br>
baby. Called a friend in Amsterdam: I'm loosing it. Can i pop ? Got  there, 
<br>
took the first job I could find: tech support for Palm Computing. Smoked 20 
<br>
joints/day, spent my weekends with MDMA and Uk-Garage in clubs. Stopped all 
<br>
medication and got ready to die hehehe. Hasn't happened yet. That's how I got 
<br>
to Holland. If I bore some of you: apologies. 
<br>
<p>Arona,
<br>
