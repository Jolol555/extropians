<em>&gt;&gt; One, I don't think tax money should be taken at all.  So, there can

be
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fact, I've been against the war from the start -- and probably every

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the Persian Gulf War and the wars in the Balkans.  (Those who did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; support the war are another matter.  I did not.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I sympathise that you do not want your tax dollars going towards
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt; ventures (particularly military ventures) I feel your reasoning is
</em><br>
flawed.
<br>
<p>Oh.  I'm really trying to lessen my involvement in this list for now,
<br>
since I've got a lot of studying to do, but your post demands a reply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If taxpayers were able to decide exactly where their tax dollars would
</em><br>
go
<br>
<em>&gt; there would be chaos - people who don't drive cars would refuse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute towards road maintenance, healthy people would refuse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute towards public health, young people would refuse to
</em><br>
contribute
<br>
<em>&gt; towards care for the elderly, employed people would refuse to
</em><br>
contribute
<br>
<em>&gt; towards welfare of any kind (justified or not). Pacifists would refuse
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; contribute towards any military (&amp; possibly any police) funding. I
</em><br>
think you
<br>
<em>&gt; can see where I am going with this...
</em><br>
<p>Heaven forbid!  But this is exactly how I think it should be: no taxes.
<br>
Funny thing that drivers should not get subsidized to use roads.  What
<br>
would be wrong with that?
<br>
<p>Also, even with people paying taxes now there is massive voluntary
<br>
charity.  So, I don't think that if no one paid taxes, suddenly every
<br>
last person who couldn't support herself or himself would suddenly die
<br>
out.  Instead, without the burden and waste of taxation, things would be
<br>
more efficiently done.  E.g., roads that really were economically
<br>
efficient instead of politically attractive would get built.  (On
<br>
private roads, see Dan Klein's _many_ papers on the subject at
<br>
<a href="http://lsb.scu.edu/~dklein/papers/default.htm">http://lsb.scu.edu/~dklein/papers/default.htm</a>)  Ditto for just about
<br>
anything else the government does.
<br>
<p>Also, if you think that people would only make socially bad choices with
<br>
their money if it stayed in their hands, why would you trust them to
<br>
vote for a government?  By your logic, why should they be allowed to
<br>
vote?  After all, wouldn't they only vote for stuff for themselves?  Do
<br>
tell!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Taxation, the great bug bear of American citizenry, HAS it's uses. Tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars can &amp; should be used to provide services that the community as
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; whole needs otherwise these needs would not be met. I am the first to
</em><br>
say
<br>
<em>&gt; that current tax structures, both here in Australia &amp; in the US, do
</em><br>
not do a
<br>
<em>&gt; very good job of catering to those needs, &amp; much work in tax reform (&amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government spending) is needed. However the constant obsession with
</em><br>
lowering
<br>
<em>&gt; tax burdens (particularly for the wealthy, who through tax avoidance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schemes, contribute increasingly small portions of their incomes) is
</em><br>
slowly
<br>
<em>&gt; killing off vital public services such as education and healthcare
</em><br>
without
<br>
<em>&gt; trimming the often ridiculous excesses of state &amp; federal government.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not for lowering taxes just for the wealthy.  I'm for abolishing
<br>
taxes for everyone.  Likewise, I'm also for cutting government spending
<br>
to zero and abolishing it too -- both here and in Australia.  (To be
<br>
honest, I'm support this position morally, but I'm not devoting my life
<br>
to it.  I've got a lot of other living to do that comes before politics.
<br>
Part of that right now involves studying.)
<br>
<p>Anyhow, see my site for more on this and check out my Libertarian
<br>
Sources links.  That might give you a better idea of some of my beliefs
<br>
in this area since I don't want to participate in a big discussion right
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
