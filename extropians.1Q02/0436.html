&lt;&lt;The concept that human life is the only form of intelligence or that or 
<br>
concept of &quot;sentient life&quot; is the only self aware form of matter/energy is 
<br>
self limiting. So the question is what are the possible mechanisms which 
<br>
would reverse the unlimited repulsion into something cyclic in whole or part. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the fundamental mechanisms to conserve information.   Can the sum 
<br>
total of the universe be programmed to conserve information? MJ &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, well-stated, however, I am not sure the physics community would agree 
<br>
with your question's premises. Rather then economics being the dismal 
<br>
science, it may end up being physics, not merely, because of what they 
<br>
discover, but how they process, analyze, and go forward.
<br>
<p>Most seem content to let the dead die forever, the universe crumble, and life 
<br>
become extinct, and woe to anyone who defies their mindset, and &quot;by the way, 
<br>
can you fund my accelerator?&quot; No wonder these geezers have trouble getting 
<br>
funding and no wonder the brightest minds have headed for computer sciences, 
<br>
and biology for answering the &quot;deep&quot; questions.
<br>
<p>Bruce Sterling, in a Wired Magazine article, last year observed something 
<br>
similar, and (paraphrasing) physics is dead and the only physics worth doing 
<br>
is computational physics.  That's farther then I am willing to go, but hey, 
<br>
this is a grumpy, rant.
<br>
<p>I think your questions deserve answers, I am not sure anyone is mentally 
<br>
geared, to even begin assess them. Good luck to both of us. Sigh!
