<p>
PBS tonight (here in LA, see local listings) is showing an Oscar nominated
<br>
documentary, Sound and Fury, about the controversy in the deaf community
<br>
over cochlear implants for deaf children, which can restore hearing.
<br>
See <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/soundandfury/">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/soundandfury/</a>.
<br>
<p>It seems almost unbelievable that what is in many ways a cure for deafness
<br>
could be controversial.  One would think that parents would want the
<br>
best for their children.  Choosing to keep a child deaf rather than to
<br>
let them grow up with hearing ability seems to border on child abuse.
<br>
<p>Yet among the deaf community the issue is highly troublesome.  The main
<br>
issue is that the deaf see themselves as a separate group with a separate
<br>
culture, almost like an ethnic or religious group.  They have their own
<br>
language (ASL) and their own customs, and face common challenges.  Deaf
<br>
people often marry other deaf people.  They are bound tightly together.
<br>
<p>But all this is defined by their handicap.  Giving a child hearing means
<br>
that they will no longer be part of their community.  They may learn
<br>
ASL but they won't really need it to survive.  They won't face the
<br>
same challenges and problems.  They will not be part of the culture.
<br>
For the deaf parents faced with the question of getting their child a
<br>
cochlear implant, they face the loss of their child from their culture.
<br>
<p>It is possible that this may be a precursor to some of the biological
<br>
enhancements which will become possible in future decades.  If you are
<br>
human, would you take steps to make your child transhuman, if it meant
<br>
that you would lose the child from your culture?  Suppose you could
<br>
give him some kind of ESP implant and allow them to join in a communal
<br>
consciousness, for example?  He might abandon the use of speech, and
<br>
begin to act in ways which you could never hope to emulate, sharing
<br>
perceptions from other enhanced individuals.
<br>
<p>This show, Sound and Fury, focuses on two families, headed by brothers
<br>
Peter, who is deaf, and Chris, who is hearing.  Peter's wife and children
<br>
are deaf; Chris's wife is deaf and his son Peter (named after his uncle)
<br>
is also deaf.  Now Heather, Peter's 7 year old daugher, wants a cochlear
<br>
implant so she can hear, but her father is opposed.  Meanwhile Peter's
<br>
brother Chris decides to get a cochlear implant for his deaf son.
<br>
<p>This tears the two brothers apart.  One cousin will be given hearing,
<br>
the other will not.  Apparently the heart of the show is a heart-rending,
<br>
dramatic ten-minute debate among the family about the propriety of giving
<br>
or witholding the gift of hearing to the deaf children.  In the end,
<br>
young Peter is given his implant, and there is a moment of drama as it
<br>
is turned on.  The implants don't always work, and some children are
<br>
upset or disturbed by the new sensation.  We get to see as this child,
<br>
deaf from birth, hears for the first time.
<br>
