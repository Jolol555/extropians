<em>&gt; I would throw my lot behind the proposed idea of space colonies, contingent on developing a low cost way to build them (such as a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; good enough coverage for most purposes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>But how exactly does this solve the problem of using ever 
<br>
advancing technology, up to and beyond Singularity, with 
<br>
reasonable chances of surviving the process?  The technology is 
<br>
essential to building the colonies and may, due to more critical 
<br>
conditions, actually advance as fast or faster there.  Are you 
<br>
depending on a first sort of people who will choose to be 
<br>
involved or less people producing technology more slowly or 
<br>
being removed from the majority of clowns on earth or some 
<br>
combination of these and other factors.  For the implied goal of 
<br>
survival I don't offhand see how your plan is more likely to 
<br>
acheive it except in creating more baskets for humans to be in.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; For those new here, I have my own project at <a href="http://ascension.webhop.org">http://ascension.webhop.org</a> for developing a technological society. The project focuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more on a new theory of social systems (which it seems most people neglect or have great misunderstanding with) and I didn't expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to begin operating anytime soon, as I expect the neccessary technology, social knowledge and motivation to reach maturity only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near the year 2050.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>So for most Singularity time guesstimates, it is too little far 
<br>
too late, right?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we have to learn the lesson of &quot;putting all our eggs in our basket&quot; the hard or the easy way? If you spend a good chunck of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you money to buy insurance for yourself or your family, you might consider this additional coverage. And when did the insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents ever give us discounts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do we have to think of insurance in a negative way? If you insured your house from theft, then does that mean you would sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around waiting to get robbed? If you insured your yourself from accidents, then do you beglect yourself so much that you get into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Insurance is fine.  But that is not precisely what this is.  It 
<br>
is advertised as a way to avoid technological disaster.  This is 
<br>
something I don't think it is likely it will accomplish.  It 
<br>
would avoid a nuclear exchange if you are far enough away or an 
<br>
asteroid striking earth, but not a lot else. Singularity will 
<br>
travel faster than your colony will and reach further.  Also, 
<br>
until we have much better technology for supporting humans in 
<br>
space and much more reason to be there, it makes a lot more 
<br>
sense in my view to build near earth infrastructure using 
<br>
largely robotics and teleprescence first.  Perhaps exploiting 
<br>
NEAs for raw materials and using those materials to build is a 
<br>
reasonable start.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can we run away from the problems on Earth by buying insurance? How do we know our plans work, or do we even have any plans at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all? Why not have a catch-all backup system that can pay dividends, by pioneering space-related technology and also giving those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologically primitive earthlings a motivation to get into space?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I have nothing against space development and quite a bit of 
<br>
reasons for it.  But escaping technological crisex is not one of 
<br>
them.  The advertising seems out-of-whack in what it accents.
