<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; I think that Persinger's experiments with triggering hypnogogic seizures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (i.e. the 'religious' or 'abduction' experience) with cycling magnetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fields on the brain demonstrate that there is a significant degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  stimuli needed to trigger these odd experiences, which could be easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  triggered by nanoprobes tapping directly into the neural net of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  brain. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, yes, but why not just look for EM fields as a reason for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;seeing&quot; things, rather then look for nanotech beings floating around? We can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly perform both types of searches. Is there currently any need to hunt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for leprechauns, though?
</em><br>
<p>Persinger's fields are rather intense, far higher than what one normally
<br>
experiences in sleep from common household objects, though it would be
<br>
interesting to test alarm clocks and electric blankets, etc as part of
<br>
the control segment of the experiment.
<br>
<p>The nanite as leprechaun hypothesis is merely one to examine, though as
<br>
objective scientists it shouldn't be shied away from since there is
<br>
significant scientific data lending credence to the idea that they
<br>
SHOULD be here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Well, the question of the presence of nano-probes or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano-civilizations living as 'crypto-dirt' is a very important test to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question of whether we live in a simulation, because if you accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reasoning of the Fermi Paradox, either they are here as nanites and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we just haven't detected them yet, or else they aren't here for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple reason that the universe is a simulation which is FAR younger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than our observations would indicate, which is why we have not seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien species jetting all over (or living as nanites in our brains or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dustmice.)  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would the purpose being for uber-beings to create this cosmos as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation? One of the things that concerns me with this conjecture is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its identical to 'young earth' creationists, who believe that God planted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fossilized remains to fool us into believing the earth is older then 6000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years.
</em><br>
<p>EXACTLY. Except that in our case, NOT finding 'fossils' of nanoprobes
<br>
would be evidence in favor of the simulation hypothesis. If we were as
<br>
irrational as the faithful, faith in the simulation hypothesis would
<br>
remain in spite of evidence of nanoprobe presence.
