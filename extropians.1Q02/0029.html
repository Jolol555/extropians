Subject: Re: Politics, Extropians
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
Hi Folks
<br>
<p>Sorry to have to butt in every now and then on the cosy, Extropian world
<br>
view,
<br>
but events move quickely and have clearly overtaken &quot;transhuman&quot; philosophy
<br>
in all of its forms. No one picked up on my posting about &quot;archeological&quot;
<br>
evidence
<br>
we are already posthuman, but never mind.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism occurred during the late C19th thru the C20th in developed
<br>
nations. Any &quot;futurist&quot; philosophy must help describe and explain the
<br>
&quot;post-human&quot;
<br>
or &quot;after-transhuman/ human&quot; condition, all other discussions are
<br>
historical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Back when I first heard about extropians, one of the major attractions
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;me was the combination of transhumanism and libertarianism.  In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;that's how I thought of extropians -- as libertarian transhumanists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Because I am unaware of any other defining trait of extropians, as
</em><br>
distinct
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;from all transhumanists.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I never figured out why there needed to be a differentiation at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stage.  I consider myself a transhumanist first, and then I'm a member of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extropy Institute because it's the only corporate organization that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been working to create a transhumanist movement.  The principles work well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for me, and the philosophy seems to pay attention to changing times and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from what I see, is able to keep up and direct itself to the advances quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nicely.
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm not sure what distinguishes extropy from plain transhumanism, if
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;advocacy of non-statism.  Can someone help me out here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Good question.  Actually, basically nothing other than a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Extropy&quot;.  Now, if we begin to unravel some of the history of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism got stated you would learn that there were Upwinger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanists, Transhumanist Artists and other smaller groups of
</em><br>
futurists
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who felt aligned with the transhumanist futurism.  But, really, the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and ideas were first generated in the extropian community.  The word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism came out of the extropian philosophy.  Not the other way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around.  However, FM-2030, wrote his view of what a transhuman is and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that his &quot;ideology&quot; was significantly transhumanist.
</em><br>
<p>I wrote &amp; published the posthuman manifesto back in the 1980's independently
<br>
of
<br>
any knowledge of any of the above. History of Posthumanity pages are at my
<br>
multi.co.uk site somewhere ......
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I'm guessing you mean to say, &quot;significantly extropian&quot;, as that would
</em><br>
neatly
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wrap this up.   If not, I don't understand what you do mean.
</em><br>
<p>There is clearly an overlap and confusion between these terms. &quot;After-human&quot;
<br>
overcomes such fuzzyness since it has no value judgements, principles or
<br>
prescriptions, just refers to what follows the &quot;human&quot; historical era.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, significantly transhumanist.  FM was not an extropian, although he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought well of the philosophy.  He was a philosopher himself, and created
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Upwingers philosophy and contributed these ideas to form a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanist ideology.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;By the way, I imagine that &quot;a-political&quot; could easily be used to
</em><br>
describe
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;libertarianism. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure. I guess so.  Frankly, I think political parties are old world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We agree on this, at least.
</em><br>
<p>ABSOLUTELY! As you know I am forging the posthuman alliance to fight
<br>
against the legacy political parties in all parts of the world. Of course
<br>
there
<br>
will be less centralised policy formation than in previous politics, with
<br>
local
<br>
candidates fleshing out policies to make them relevent in their own areas.
<br>
<p>Fraternal Greetings and Happy 2002!
