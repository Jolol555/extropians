<em>&gt; &gt; You misunderstood... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you seem to have missed is that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software is bundled with other products and gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installed without permission. 
</em><br>
<p>I got it the same way everybody else did... Have you
<br>
been reading what I write?  I downloaded KaZa.
<br>
<p>It's deceptive phrases like this that are upsetting
<br>
me.  IT DIDN'T INSTALL WITHOUT PERMISSION.  IT'S NOT A
<br>
VIRUS.  IT DOESN'T HIJACK LINKS.  IT DOESN'T DIRECT
<br>
CHILDREN TO PORN.
<br>
<p>Every person who installed TopText gave permission to
<br>
the install program to do so... If you didn't want it
<br>
all you had to do was uncheck the box in front of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most people don't know it is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installed, and they never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requested it.  
</em><br>
<p>Then they are idiots.  It was a 'component' in the
<br>
installation set up screen... and had an explanation
<br>
of what it was for.  Anybody who who installs stuff on
<br>
the 'puters without paying attention to what the
<br>
dialogue boxes say deserves whatever happens to them. 
<br>
Especially when they are downloading freeware.
<br>
<p>They had the same choice I did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They don't know why they are there, where they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming from, or how to get rid of them.  
</em><br>
<p>It was easy to get rid of...  So again, if actually
<br>
true, they are idiots.
<br>
<p>I think you don't know anybody who had TopText on
<br>
their PC.  I think all of the information you have
<br>
about it you got from the garbage website.
<br>
<p>The guy lied.  Plain and simply.  He felt that TopText
<br>
was cutting into whatever scam HE had going so he
<br>
fought back.  You've been had.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I pointed to this particular site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they had a script to detect if the software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was present on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine, as an aid for people who don't know what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going on.  
</em><br>
<p>So you think people who read the extropian list are
<br>
idiots?
<br>
<p>This was a non-problem... and as such wasn't in need
<br>
of a solution.  Now if you had posted that to AOL and
<br>
MSN forums (where folks who are scared of the internet
<br>
hang out) you might have done some good... but here I
<br>
am wasting even more of my time on this... I'm just
<br>
gonna drop it.
