Subject: Jaron Lanier Got Up My Shnoz on AI
<br>
<p><p>This is a dec 29 Guardian article on Jaron Lanier. Boy I wish we had more
<br>
'eccentics' like this around. We need 'em. He's well worth following. One of
<br>
the great 'sleeping bear pokers'.
<br>
<p>The Guardian Profile -Jaron Lanier - The virtual visionary
<br>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4326550,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4326550,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>However, I'm a bit mystified by his attitude on AI.  Maybe my logic is down
<br>
the toilet. I can't tell, maybe you can.
<br>
My thoughts, written after I read the article, I dump here.
<br>
===============
<br>
Jaron Lanier is a regular at www.edge.org &lt;<a href="http://www.edge.org">http://www.edge.org</a>&gt;. He's always
<br>
very challenging and seems to make sense. However, I don't understand his
<br>
ideas about the limits of technology. We, humans, are technology. Just
<br>
because we're constructed with DNA or any method you'd care to consider in
<br>
no way invalidates another method for creation of intelligence.
<br>
<p>As I read the article he isn't saying that we shouldn't create AI, because
<br>
that would be impious, (although he does seem to have leanings in that
<br>
direction). He also denies that he is taking the line taken by people like
<br>
Ray Tallis, i.e. that Dennett and Pinker are wrong and human consciousness
<br>
is ultimately mysterious and non-reproducible. He seems to say that we have
<br>
no way of measuring or defining intelligence and so if we created an AI we
<br>
wouldn't realise or know we had done it because we would have no way of
<br>
recognising it. I must say this does sound bizarre to me. I can understand
<br>
the notion that there might be forms of intelligence which we might not
<br>
recognise but why assume this is the only kind we could create? Why could we
<br>
not create something analogous to our own which we could therefore
<br>
recognise? The two positions he rejects both seem more coherent to me. Steve
