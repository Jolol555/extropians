<p>
Anders - 
<br>
<p>Wonderful, and thank you. A lot to think about. A
<br>
brief response: I had two goals with the piece, first
<br>
descriptive and then to draw normative conclusions. I
<br>
think your essay concurs that many &gt;Hists, including
<br>
Max More a couple days ago on this list and yourself
<br>
in the past, defined &gt;Hism more narrowly, permitting a
<br>
broad group of ideologies to associate with them. My
<br>
normative argument was that &gt;Hists who share liberal
<br>
democratic values should organize to make sure that
<br>
those values shape the most visible expressions of
<br>
transhumanism. You argument is that &gt;Hists should
<br>
recognize that there are core political values (i.e.
<br>
liberty, equality and solidarity) embedded in the
<br>
trajectory of humanist Enlightenment values which give
<br>
rise to &gt;Hism. I agree, and I think this makes the
<br>
liberal democratic versions/expressions of
<br>
transhumanism a more natural memetic evolution. I
<br>
think this is a fruitful line of argument, but I
<br>
harbor Wittgensteinian(2) suspicions that we may just
<br>
be playing a word game, and that the memes will
<br>
recombine in ways that violate their pedigrees and
<br>
clades.
<br>
<p>Second, you suggest that the value on individual
<br>
liberty in the liberal democratic tradition, and
<br>
thereby - you argue - inside the &gt;Hist definition,
<br>
would suggest a global order tolerating a wide variety
<br>
of social orders and in which any individual can leave
<br>
a nation for a nation more to their liking. Although I
<br>
generally agree with this principle, another principle
<br>
of liberal democracy is solidarity - the obligation to
<br>
protect the human rights of other and uplift the
<br>
downtrodden. In terms of global order I think this
<br>
requires evolution towards a stronger global
<br>
government which can, for instance, make sure that the
<br>
Declaration of Human Rights are enforced in every
<br>
country. These solidaristic obligations are paired
<br>
with social contractual responsibilities to support
<br>
the institutions that enable them. In other words, I
<br>
think being subject to law and taxation can be argued
<br>
from basic liberal democratic principles so long as
<br>
one acknowledges more libdem principles (i.e. equality
<br>
and solidarity) than liberty. Even starting from
<br>
liberty, as Amartya Sen has effectively argued, one
<br>
can still arrive at the need for a social democratic
<br>
state. 
<br>
<p>To make this practical, faced with the threat that an
<br>
island state was experimenting with nano weapons of
<br>
mass destruction, would it make sense to argue that
<br>
the only &gt;Hist position would be benign tolerance and
<br>
non-interference? As I argue in my recent essay on
<br>
Apocalytptic Technologies, the dark side of &gt;H tech
<br>
makes clearer than ever the need for global governance
<br>
and collective security.
<br>
<p>I look forward to working out the &gt;Hist agenda with
<br>
you, and thank again for your very thoughtful
<br>
response.
<br>
<p>J. Hughes
