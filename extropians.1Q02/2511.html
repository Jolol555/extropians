<p><em>&gt;I would freely accept that GH supplementation in humans might accelerate

</em><br>
<p>Quite possible.  Reducing GH will reduce insulin growth factor activity,
<br>
and that reduction seems to be what triggers the CR effect.  I believe all of 
<br>
the longevity mutants with identified effects downregulate the IGF-1 pathway.
<br>
It's in nematodes and yeast as well as mice; that's pretty broad.
<br>
There's a lot of concern on the CR list about osteoporosis (several of the 
<br>
serious
<br>
practitioners have it as middle-aged males; very unusual) and osteoporosis
<br>
appears to be linked to low IGF-1 levels in humans.
<br>
<p>But the link between low IGF-1 activity and slow aging is very good;
<br>
hence it's very likely that GH supplementation will speed aging per se.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The length of life x quality of life product is one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has a very subjective valuation.  We must always be careful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;look to the person whose life is involved to ascertain those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;values.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  But right now, I'd say don't use GH unless you have some medical
<br>
problem (ie. osteo, immune deficiency) that justifies it.  GH for looks,
<br>
sexiness, or athletic performance is a bad deal IMO - you're risking 
<br>
many years of life and early deterioration.
