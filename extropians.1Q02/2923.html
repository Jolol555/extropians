Spud Howe quoted thus:
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; Suppose a nanocivilization sent out nanobots aboard a von Neumann probe
</em><br>
(or
<br>
<em>&gt;  otherwise) to our &quot;lovely&quot; planet. Their mission is to destroy any
</em><br>
evidence
<br>
<em>&gt;  gathered by humans of the galactic civilization that in fact exists out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  there. Is this scenario physically possible?  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And remarked,
<br>
<em>&gt; The simple answer is no. There is not one piece of evidence that such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanobot does exist,
</em><br>
<p>I think we may be talking past each other here. I realize that sometimes
<br>
when people say 'possibility' they mean something like 'plausibility' or
<br>
'probability' but this is not what I was asking at this stage. What I am
<br>
asking is whether this sort of meme snatching would violate anything we know
<br>
about the physical laws of the universe, e.g., if human brains were of such
<br>
a delicate and interwoven constitution that removing one memory would
<br>
destroy the whole brain then this would count against the physical
<br>
possibility of this scenario. Of course, what we know of human brains is
<br>
that they are not like this. As for the plausibility of the meme snatcher
<br>
conjecture perhaps it will help to clarify if I put the point about evidence
<br>
for this scenario paradoxically: the best evidence we have for the
<br>
conjecture is that we do not have any evidence for the conjecture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On another matter, your conference on Practical Cosmology, perhaps needs
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; include something like Existential Cosmology, touching upon meaning, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain-relief, (at least!).
</em><br>
I hope the subject matter is already sufficiently broad to attract interest.
<br>
Furthermore, it is possible that some aspects of the topics of meaning and
<br>
pain reduction might already fall under the purview of Practical Cosmology
<br>
in that they might figure in agents practical reasoning about how to remake
<br>
the universe. However, I will keep your suggestion in mind. Thanks! Mark.
