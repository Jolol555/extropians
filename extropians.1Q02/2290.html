<p>
<em>&gt; Back to the 'raison', think of dead universes, and the desire for enjoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watching them brought to life (digital or otherwise) and seeing evolving uber
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds evolving is many of those. Kind of fun for the uber minds, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the results are difficult to predict.
</em><br>
<p>How do we know we can fulfill all the following criteria:
<br>
1) live in a computer simulation
<br>
2) have sentient beings outside the simulation taking an interest in us
<br>
3) that sentient beings actually bringing us &quot;alive&quot;
<br>
4) that they will treat us with pleasant circumstances
<br>
5) that no accidents will occur to break this thread of events (like a computer crash)
<br>
<p>-- and --
<br>
<p>6) that we have a sufficient definition of what we call the &quot;self&quot;
<br>
[what do we mean by the self?]
<br>
<p>7) that it still matters after we die (as our &quot;original&quot; consciousness had disappeared
<br>
[if someone made a copy of you and instantiate you at another place, does it matter to the original &quot;you&quot;?]
<br>
<p>8) that our host universe will last forever, or it consists of a simulation that will fulfill the above creteria and this forever
<br>
(in a never-ending loop)
<br>
<p><p>What if we have to die one day? How would we confront with the situation that, despite our technological powress and knowledge, we
<br>
will still have to die?
<br>
<p>The purpose of existance I seek does not concern itself with absolute &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, or even a factual answer (like genes and
<br>
&quot;preprogrammed&quot; disires). It does not matter who and what preprogrammed, predisposed or did whatever to our universe, but why do we
<br>
even bother to continue subjecting ourselves to these assuming that we could break free of these and look at the question
<br>
objectively. The factual answers may give an apparent meaning, but that provides only an illusion (or a &quot;sham&quot;, as Plato puts it).
<br>
<p><p>This question concerns itself with every one of us, asking: &quot;Why do you bother to live when you have to die eventually? You want to
<br>
achieve this or that, but do they really matter if everyone has to die eventually?&quot;
<br>
<p>Strangely, this being still does not understand the preceptions of others who thought this question has lesser importance or
<br>
relevance.
