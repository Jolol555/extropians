<em>&gt; You seem to assume that only evil acts can generate hate, so if somebody

</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately hate does not need such specific conditions to be produced.
</em><br>
<p>My language was deliberately value neutral when it came to morals.  I 
<br>
certainly wasn't arguing that the terrorists are morally right, or that only 
<br>
evil could have caused their hate.  I was arguing that it is important to 
<br>
find out whether it is more efficient to continue the course or to change 
<br>
one's behavior, before one takes irrevocable actions.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;In the long term, there are only two ways not to lose:  modify one's
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Changing our behavior so we become Islamic fundamentalists ourselves might
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm sure it wouldn't.  In any event, that would require more than a behavior 
<br>
change. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A more certain approach would be to alter our behavior so we were no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer successful. If western civilization no longer lead the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economically, culturally, scientifically, and militarily, if Islam didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even come in second but was dead last, then yes, under those conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they might learn to love us.
</em><br>
<p>No, they wouldn't.  
<br>
<p>The obvious way, of course, which you've ignored, is to only retaliate 
<br>
against those who have used force against us, while initiating restitution
<br>
for those who had force used against them, paid by those who did that.
<br>
<p>Of course, that won't happen. :(
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      &gt;or kill everyone who may have sympathy for those who are martyred for
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Easy question, I pick scenario number 2.
</em><br>
<p>We're talking about over a billion people here, most of whom have are 
<br>
innocent.  It seems better to you to kill a billion people than to figure out 
<br>
how to get along?
