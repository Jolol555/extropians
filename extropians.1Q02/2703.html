<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So the US is no longer a free or capitalistic country since we

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; where you have to prove they should give your property back).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The forfeiture you speak of is specifically in the case where a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has been convicted of a drug trafficking offense, where after criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conviction, their property is seized by the government in civil court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proceedings, on the basis that the property was purchased, in part or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole, by the proceeds of drug money, leaving the owner to prove that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they didn't use drug money to obtain the property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not always.  Not to go off on another whining-about-Florida-rant, but....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Florida, carrying large sums of cash, say over $10,000, is legally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined as &quot;suspicious&quot;.  The police can and do seize such large amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cash under the assumption that it is drug money.  The cash can be retrieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only if the person can prove where it came from and that it was obtained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally.  Any unexplained cash that is not later retrieved is simply kept by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, of course. Not that I like it, but this is an entirely
<br>
rational argument to make, because if you kept that amount of cash
<br>
outside of a bank account, then you must be trying to hide it from the
<br>
government for some reason. At the very least you are trying to evade
<br>
tax laws, at worst you are engaging in illicit trade.
<br>
<p>It is also rational to assume that if you got that amount of cash
<br>
legitimately, you should be able to demonstrate with receipt records who
<br>
you got it from and for what... at which point you'll be asked to pay
<br>
taxes on it...  of course, the fact that many businesses deal in far
<br>
greater sums every day has no bearing... a legitimate business is
<br>
assumed to keep the sort of records that would show how the money was
<br>
earned ;)
