</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My physics question is: how does one characterize the energy transfer that

<p><p>Let's get sytematic about this- first, we calculate the velocity change
<br>
of Jerome's mini-van in the intial collision:  this is an inelastic
<br>
collision that conserves momentum:
<br>
<p>m1*v1 + m2*v2 = (m1+m2)v3
<br>
<p>using american provincial units
<br>
<p>m1= 3000 lbm
<br>
v1= 0 ft/s
<br>
<p>m2= 4000 lbm
<br>
v2= 35 mph *22/15 ft/s/mph = 51 ft/s
<br>
m2v2 = 204000 lbm-ft/s
<br>
m1+m2 = 7000 lbm   then
<br>
<p>v3 = 29.1 ft/s, about 20 mph  The mini van slowed the other vehicle
<br>
substantially
<br>
<p>Thus the doorframe hit him at about the same speed as falling from 12.5
<br>
feet up; a very serious hit indeed.
<br>
<p>The combined 7000 lb vehicles then accelerated him up to essentially the
<br>
same speed; the second collison is (204000 lbm-ft/s)/7220 lbm = 28.25
<br>
ft/s final velocity (neglecting friction on the ice).
<br>
<p>The energy imparted to Jerome's body in the impact was mv^2/2, but we
<br>
must use slugs mass to get the units to work properly-
<br>
<p>E= 220/32.2 * 28.25^2 /2 = 2727 ft-lb
<br>
<p>Guessing at the distance over which the acceleration took place at about
<br>
.5 ft (human bodies are squishy), the force was about 5500 lbf and he
<br>
pulled about 25 gees.  Ouch, indeed.  I hope you're recovering well.
