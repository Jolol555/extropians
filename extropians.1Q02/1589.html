<p>Yes, this is important to remember. The best life extension methods are
<br>
clean drinking water and refridgerators :-) 
<br>
<p>However, the health care sector is still relevant in that our goals of
<br>
self-modification rely on biomedical technologies that will most likely
<br>
be handled by it or some descendant of the current biomedical complex.
<br>
This means making business models and operating philosophies helpful to
<br>
our aims more common will be important to help us change in the future.
<br>
<p>A core issue is likely a gradual redefinition of health and illness
<br>
towards something like Robert Freitas' volitional normative model; if
<br>
this could be achieved (and it would take quite a bit of work to spread
<br>
this idea among doctors, medical philosophers, regulators and
<br>
patients) many big stumbling blocks would start withering away. But
<br>
such a change in view (health is *subjective* optimal functioning, and
<br>
may go far beyond merely normal function) would also require profound
<br>
changes in what treatments are paid by what insurance or which
<br>
government.
