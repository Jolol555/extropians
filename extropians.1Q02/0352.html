<em>&gt; It should be easy to modify an existing game, and get an educational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; licence. Problem would be that the (govt owned) educational market for such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a game would probably like to see whatever it is they are teaching, proven 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by such a simulation.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think it should be tried to give that to schools. Let the kids
<br>
play during the night, and sleep during the school ;-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Rather than a model that may prove the oposite. For a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercial market, the game should be fun, and to most kids fun means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explosions or car races, so finding funding for such a project won't be easy.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually I think it should not be aimed at kids, but at adolescent and
<br>
adults. Other kind of tools could be aimed at kids -- that leads to
<br>
the general use of visual simulation to teach about processes and
<br>
increase the ability of thinking dynamically, something interesting,
<br>
too. (but that teachers should understand to start with)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In most &quot;god-sim&quot; strategy games with an economical aspect, the laissez 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faire principle generally works best, (which generally isn't much more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having low taxes).
</em><br>
<p><p>I only know the sim-city stuff. I had a try, but it didnt' look very
<br>
sexy to me, for various reasons. And it's not even a multiplayer game.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Most of those games however also show the kids playing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, that going to war with one of the other players can be very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profitable...
</em><br>
<p><p>If (as I said in the other post where I developed the idea more) one
<br>
makes it explicitely close to reality, then 1) it will be difficult,
<br>
risky, etc. to make wars, 2) many people will oppose it, because of
<br>
the &quot;illustrative stake&quot; (they don't want war in reality, so they
<br>
don't want the game to take this course either).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If you're serious about making such a game,
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm serious about suggesting someone makes it !
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; i'd advise you to check out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Simcity 3000&quot;, as well as an older game called &quot;Shadow President&quot;. They're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both games that have a little bit more than the average simplified &quot;tax&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model (on the city social/economic level and on global foreign policy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respectively), they're both games that though being more complex than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard game in their genre,  succeeded in keeping the &quot;fun&quot; appeal of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;game&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Thanks for the pointers.
