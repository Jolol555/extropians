<p>As stated in the 80's movie 'Soul Man', &quot;Financial aid is for kids whose
<br>
parents are poor, not for kids whose parents are assholes&quot;.
<br>
<p>The problem being that I knew of many students who were kids of rich
<br>
parents who abused the system: they lived in a separate home from their
<br>
parents for the last two years of high school, were paid enough of a
<br>
salary to cover rent and food for that period from the parent's
<br>
companies (i.e. little enough to qualify for financial aid as a 'poor
<br>
student'), and as a result qualified freshman year for full financial
<br>
aid as 'independent minors'.
