Steve Jackson is an extropian? Very, very cool.

Hmm, it seems my H programming could have begun as early as The Warlock of Firetop Mountain!

Yes, when I first learned that the Steve Jackson in the database was *the* 
<br>
Steve Jackson, I was happily surprised.  I quite literally grew up on his 
<br>
RPG-like &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; books.  It's interesting how, without 
<br>
knowing the Steve Jackson connection, years later I became involved with 
<br>
Extropy.  I'm sure there are a number of stories like this out there.

<p>As a young teen I loved to play his Microgame collection of wargames!  I think I bought just about everyone.  I have fond memories of Chitin, Invasion of the Air-Eaters. Rivets, Holy War, Warpwar, Ogre(still very much around), Ice War, and the many other very inexpensive, yet very entertaining and creative titles he produced.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Later I learned to love his roleplaying game, The Fantasy Trip.  This had combat based on the Melee and Wizard Microgames, which were a cool take on miniatures combat.  
<br>
<p>His &quot;Choose your own Adventure&quot; books were so good!  At the time that type of thing was popular.  But no one did it as well as Steve Jackson.
<br>
<p>Later, he came out with the great GURPS roleplaying game system, which I loved for the way he would adapt so many different times, books, and genres for gameplay.  And I can't wait to get my hands on Transhuman Space!! : )
<br>
<p>I first realized Steve Jackson was involved in our &quot;subculture&quot; when I saw him post on Cryonet.  I was stunned!!  And to top it off, at the bottom of his post it said, &quot;Yes, I'm THAT Steve Jackson.&quot; lol!
<br>
<p>I am &quot;one of the other stories&quot; out there.  But considering the science fiction and fantasy themes Steve Jackson used in his games which I loved, there is little wonder to me that I wound up here!  And I am very glad Steve Jackson is reading Cryonet, and hopefully signed up.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
