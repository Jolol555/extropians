<em>&gt; &gt; America's puritan attorney general, John Ashcroft (who apparently thinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dancing is against god) has had the bare breast on a statue of justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; covered up for reasons of decency:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/2002/01/30/FFXB14EK0XC.html">http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/2002/01/30/FFXB14EK0XC.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I suppose it's a step forward from the Taliban; he hasn't had the statue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blown up yet...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... I have to say I don't see the problem here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Ashcroft doesn't like the bare-breasted statue of Justice.  He makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the decision to have the statue covered up while he's Attorney General. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what way is this bad?  As far as I can tell, he's just optimizing his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal space according to his preferences.  Sure, it would be wrong if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ashcroft tried to impose this preference on others, but the above article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives no evidence that he has done so or plans to do so.
</em><br>
<p>I might agree if it were his house, or even his office interior.  But
<br>
the exterior of public buildings is public art.  That statue cost a lot
<br>
of American tax dollars to build, and it's /ours/, not his.  And the
<br>
fact that he spent 8,000 more of our tax dollars to deprive us of its
<br>
esthetic value is even worse.
<br>
<p>Legally, he probably does have the discretion to decide how to spend
<br>
the justice department's budget on art, and he can make judgments about
<br>
the esthetic value of that art.  But when generations of his predecessors
<br>
all worked hard to create and preserve that particular piece, it seems
<br>
something of a slap in their face to vandalize it.  At least his change
<br>
is removable so they next AG with more sense can fix it.
