<p>You are talking about entirely different realms here.  One is nanoscale,
<br>
the other is macroscale.  You seem to not be seeing what many people
<br>
don't see which is that biotechnology *IS* nanotechnology.  My
<br>
current business plan is on how to make robust bio-nanotechnology available
<br>
to large numbers of molecular biologists within *this* decade.  It has
<br>
been reviewed by Eric Drexler, Robert Freitas, and several people with
<br>
training in genetics and molecular biology.  They have not found any
<br>
fundamental flaws in it.
<br>
<p>I think you might want to either (a) consider accepting the opinions
<br>
of the people who have studied this; or (b) educate yourself about it
<br>
so you can evaluate the probabilities based on your own knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like I said, I don't expect that era within our life times.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm working pretty hard to make it happen because I'm pretty
<br>
sure my life depends on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see your points on the advance of technology.  I don't agree that it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be provided free for everyone.  Look at Microsoft!
</em><br>
<p>Look at Linux!  Its effectively free.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When someone discovers this great technology, they will patent it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop anyone else from getting it, and LICENSE it to the general public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a large fee.
</em><br>
<p>Not if there is open source competition.  Open source significantly limits
<br>
the &quot;large fees&quot; you can charge (see below).  Human inventiveness suggests
<br>
that there ways around most patents.  Did Amazon's stupid one-click patent
<br>
stop the web-based sales industry?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When PC's are as cheap as cell phones, they will still be just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unafordable to most of the world.
</em><br>
<p>Granted.  But that gives the manufacturers incentives to drive the
<br>
costs down even further.  I think the standard rule of thumb is
<br>
double the number, half the cost.  So long as there are billions
<br>
in China and India without cell phones and PCs manufacturers
<br>
have an incentive to see how low they can drive the prices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same argument was made for &quot;money&quot;.  People predicted that after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world got some billionaires money would be superfluous and they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philanthropically pay to end world hunger.  This hasn't happened.
</em><br>
<p>That is because the numbers don't add up.  Even if all the billions
<br>
of all the billionaires in the world adds up to $600 billion, divided
<br>
over ~6 billion people, thats $100/person.  Not enough to feed them
<br>
for very long.
<br>
<p>It also assumes that throwing money at the problem will solve it.
<br>
It doesn't.  The Hunger Project spent years working on this and
<br>
the key things required are education, access to financial resources
<br>
and changing the status of women in society.  Those are not things
<br>
where you can wave a magic wand and make the problems go away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No matter how fast the &quot;doubling time&quot;, only the people rich enough to own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first nanobots would control the newer nanobots.  All the &quot;doubling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time&quot; does is to create more nanobots for those who already have them.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to be assuming that the &quot;rich&quot; will be inherently evil
<br>
and will act to oppress the masses of people.  I'd cite 3
<br>
examples, The Gates Foundation, The Ellison Medical Foundation
<br>
and Ted Turner where that concept seems to have some problems.
<br>
<p>What do you think will happen the first time Zyvex publishes a paper
<br>
showing concretely that diamondoid molecular nanoassembly is possible?
<br>
Do you think the Science Ministries in Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Japan,
<br>
Russia, Germany, etc. are going to let that go by unnoticed?  Do you
<br>
think that VC firms with tens of billions of dollars are not going
<br>
to create a dozen new Zyvexes?
<br>
<p>Can you make a reasonable case that the rich will be able to control
<br>
nanobot development?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Huh?  I know my body mass isn't doubling every 20 minutes.  What are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refering to when you say &quot;biobots&quot; and &quot;doubling time&quot; already existing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our bodies?
</em><br>
<p>You have ~40 trillion bacteria in or on your body. Many of them are E. coli.
<br>
The doubling time for E. coli is ~20 minutes.  If, as I said, you provided
<br>
them with access to sufficient energy and raw materials, they would outmass
<br>
your body in less than a day.  Eukaryotic cells in contrast have a doubling
<br>
time of ~24 hours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That sounds great.  The big point you are missing is where are YOU going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get your first biobot?  The microscopic, infinitely programmable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-maintaining nanites you are talking about may not even be possible!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Definitely not free.
</em><br>
<p>Every time you sit on the toilet you are throwing away billions of them.
<br>
What hasn't existed previously is the ability to robustly reprogram them.
<br>
Right now we only reprogram them to produce insulin, growth hormone,
<br>
enzymes for the biotechnology industry, enzymes in your detergent,
<br>
enzymes to give your jeans that stonewashed look (without the associated
<br>
fiber damage of actually &quot;stone-washing&quot; them), etc.   I'm planning on
<br>
correcting the situation so robust reprogramming is much easier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; LOL!  You're doing it again!  You are protesting that these things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;free&quot; and then talk about burning diamonds for fuel and having a whole suit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made of diamonds!  I don't even think Bill Gates can afford this &quot;free&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.
</em><br>
<p>No, but given the points I make above about nanotechnology, can you make
<br>
the case that Bill Gates will have an exclusive lock on it?  As I pointed
<br>
out in a post recently on Nanodot.org, after you adjust for salaries,
<br>
the Chinese (mainland) funding for Nanotechnology development is equivalent
<br>
to the U.S. funding.  Spend a little time perusing the nanodot archives.
<br>
You need to make the case that the technology &quot;wave&quot; this is something
<br>
that the rich can &quot;contain&quot; or &quot;suppress&quot; (unless I'm missing something
<br>
in what you are saying).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And how does this give me free energy?
</em><br>
<p>Solar ponds.  It looks like the energy yield per acre based on biobots
<br>
converting solar energy into methane or hydrogen is &gt; $2000/acre at
<br>
current prices.  This is much higher than agricultural yields which
<br>
are &lt;&lt; $500/acre.  (And in Texas most of the land is only capable of
<br>
being rangeland, not agricultural land, so there is going to be a high
<br>
incentive to dedicate it to energy production.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course.  If I can design your miraculous nanomachines, I would be rich.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, once I had such wondrous machines, I would be god-like and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care about money.  (Although I still would be out of luck when I publish my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;open source&quot; and no-one GIVES me one of the nanobots.)
</em><br>
<p>If I can design one first, I'll be happy to give you one on the condition
<br>
that you give one to anyone who asks for one.  Oh, and you and anyone
<br>
you give them to will have to pay me a small royalty for any income
<br>
you derive from them.  Uses dedicated to &quot;personal&quot; survival needs
<br>
are exempted from the royalty.  Of course that probably provides an
<br>
incentive for someone else to develop a similar miraculous nanomachine that
<br>
does what mine does and charge you a lower royalty.  And then the real
<br>
open source advocates will design something that does what my miraculous
<br>
nanomachine does and give it away completely for free and I'll be out
<br>
of business.  So you see, if anyone developing miraculous nanomachines
<br>
&quot;breaks ranks&quot; and allows them to be used for &quot;personal survival&quot; needs
<br>
for little or nothing, that allows &quot;matter programmers&quot; who are interested
<br>
in doing so to live for &quot;free&quot; and you immediately have a rapid trend
<br>
towards everything becoming very inexpensive.
<br>
