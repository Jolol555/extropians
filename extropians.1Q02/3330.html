<em>&gt;                     The Secret Life of Dust 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;            From the Cosmos to the Kitchen Counter, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              the Big Consequences of little Things 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Ever wonder what dust really is and what if any good it is? This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amazing book has the answer. Think it gets muggy now? Imagine 300% 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humidity, it won't thanks to dust. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extremely well written science. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is one of those books that will have you shaking your head in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;admiration as you read. 
</em><br>
<p>When I first received the advert for this book, from Amazon last July,
<br>
I passed it around our dust group, and nobody in my group was
<br>
interested enough to buy the book.
<br>
<p>Review by amazon.com July 2001
<br>
<em>&gt;What is dust? It's more than the generic &quot;stuff&quot; that lightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;covers our tabletops if we're not diligent cleaners, writes Hannah
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Holmes. In fact, dust comes from such exotic places as stars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volcanoes, the evaporating seas, the clothing of kings, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dead people. Sometimes benevolent, sometimes destructive, dust is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little bit of everything. Holmes puts all kinds of dust under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microscope in this short, sweet book.
</em><br>
<p>Most household 'dust' is pieces of human skin, mites, junk. Finding
<br>
cosmic dust in your home is not that common. For our group, when we
<br>
think of 'dust', it's cosmic, so we have a bit of an image problem and
<br>
the book description (above) was discouraging for us. Secret? Hmm.
<br>
<p>The origin of dust is late-evolved stars, and what we have in our
<br>
solar system is heavily processed material (because the dust lifetime
<br>
is tens of thousands of years), which is mostly generated from comets
<br>
and asteroids. 
<br>
<p>The exciting aspect of dust for us is that we are both observers on
<br>
the dust evolution process (dust being tracers of the Universe's
<br>
evolution, like photons), as well as its result. I am guessing that
<br>
the author she didn't go into too much detail about that ..?
