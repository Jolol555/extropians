<em>&gt;There's also the issue of poseurs and intentional spoofs, like the paper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Alan Sokal successfully submitted to the postmodern journal, _Social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Text_:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Alan Sokal, it may be remembered, is an N.Y.U. physicist who, in 1996, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;submitted a paper called &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot; to Social Text, a journal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of cultural criticism based in New York City. As the issue containing his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paper was going to press, Lingua Franca published Sokal's disclosure that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he'd conceived the article as a hoax. A full-blown turf war soon ensued, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with commentators from all sides of the academic and political spectrum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;using the episode to score points. In addition to reprinting the original 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paper, The Sokal Hoax assembles a full range of those responses to it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the defensive posture taken by the editors of Social Text; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right-wing chortling over the left's embarrassment; to internal left 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;polemics; to replies by some of the theorists Sokal had strung up by their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own petard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The title of Sokal's paper alone should have aroused suspicions among 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Social Text editors, but Sokal mixed up science, pseudo-science, leftish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pieties and pure gibberish into a brew they apparently could not resist. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here, to set the tone of the piece, is a typical Sokalism: &quot;The victory of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cybernetics over quantum physics in the 1940s and 1950s can be explained 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in large part by the centrality of cybernetics to the ongoing capitalist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drive for automation of industrial production, compared with the marginal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;industrial relevance of quantum mechanics.&quot; The choice between quantum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanics and cybernetics is pseudo-history; that it made it into print is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real egg on the face of the Social Text editors. And it fits right in with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sokal's agenda, which was to spoof anti-science attitudes by pretending to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lay the groundwork for a postmodern quantum theory. Sokal agitates for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;liberatory&quot; science-one that has shed the Enlightenment &quot;dogma&quot; that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there &quot;exists an external world&quot; to be!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  grasped by &quot;the (so-called) scientific method,&quot; and has opened itself to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the insights of the feminist, queer, multiculturalist, and ecological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critiques.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Sokal liberally sprinkles the spoof with undoctored quotes from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leading lights of postmodernism, many of them French. Here, for example, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is Derrida doodling on about the &quot;Einsteinian constant,&quot; which he takes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be &quot;not a constant&quot; at all and &quot;not a center,&quot; and hardly even &quot;the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concept of something&quot; but, instead, &quot;the very concept of the game.&quot; And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here is Jacques Lacan seizing on notions of &quot;differential topology,&quot; a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposedly promising approach to some problems in physics, in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elucidate the &quot;structure of mental disease&quot;-because, after all, if &quot;one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can show that a cut on a torus corresponds to the neurotic subject,&quot; then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why wouldn't another &quot;cross-cut surface&quot; correspond &quot;to another sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mental disease&quot;? Other pomo heavy hitters, including Gilles Deleuze, Felix 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Guattari, and Jean-Francois Lyotard are allowed to speak verbatim as well. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Under the guise of agreeing with them, Sokal exposes them to their fair 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;share of (ultimately self-) abuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;One perennial lesson the book appears to reinforce is the immiscibility, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as in oil and water, of Anglo-Saxon thought and French rhetoric. French 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinkers reserve the right to dip their tropes in tincture of the absurd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to give them extra firepower, a right we reserve for poets, late-night 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comedians, and animated cartoons...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Quoted from the Atlantic Online: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/crosscurrents/cc2000-12-21.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/crosscurrents/cc2000-12-21.htm</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The complete text of Sokal's article may be found at:
</em><br>

<p><p>I agree with your analysis of the French (and derivative &quot;pomo&quot; ) 
<br>
thought.  However, the point to keep in mind that some of these people DO 
<br>
have valid - to some degree, presumably - points to make and dismissing it 
<br>
all as &quot;crap&quot; might be premature.  Not that I haven't done it in some 
<br>
instances... :-}
<br>
<p>I guess you have to decide whether the topic being discussed is worth the 
<br>
energy and time needed to decipher the propositions being made from the 
<br>
poetry being used to make them.
