<p>that's very true. by nature of it's alienness, it is impossible to know an alien culture.

want to come visit us hicks.

<p>hmmm. i've heard good things about that book, it's going into my reading list now..

thanks!

<p><em>&gt;Actually, there was evidence in spades of quarks, of a sol-centric

</em><br>
<em>&gt;they only required that people observe that evidence and draw the proper

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;and accurate predictions of lunar eclipses, comets, and planetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movement for thousands of years have been performed. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>point taken. though it would be very hard to extrapolate a pentium 4 overclocked to 3.5 
<br>
gigahertz based on one of these mechanical calculators. (i'd even go so far as to say that  
<br>
we may have passed a singularity, from the dark ages or the ancient world...)
<br>
while people in the dark ages probably could have figured out that the earth is not the 
<br>
center of the solar system or the universe, the technology to detect quarks quite simply 
<br>
wasn't there. even if someone (or many someones) was brilliant enough to deduce their 
<br>
existence in theory, they would not have a way to prove it. but nevertheless, quarks 
<br>
existed then, and exist now.
