<p>Yes. The pun `Diaspar' = `despair' is used by Gregory Benford in his awful
<br>
clunking sequel to AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT, where he also speculates that
<br>
`Lys' = `lies'. This is nonsense. Diaspar, as Steve notes, is an exultant
<br>
technophilic vision of futurity (as seen through 1930s' eyes and updated to
<br>
the 1950s), although ACC did the usual good sf job of probing at the weak
<br>
points of utopia: in this case, a society where everyone was born adult,
<br>
lived 1000 years and then returned to substrate memory until the next
<br>
random incarnation is indeed likely to be judged futile from anyone outside
<br>
the equilibrium. He provided a sort of psychosocial explanation--an
<br>
ideology and faked histiry--for this stasis, as well as a sophisticated
<br>
permacultural and quasi-parapsychological alternative in Lys. The outcome
<br>
of Alvin's quest to breach the walls of Diaspar is not the return of
<br>
mortality, necessarily, so much as the recovery of, well, extropy: an
<br>
awareness of the immensity of the cosmos, of the true history of humankind
<br>
and the other sophonts of the galaxy, of the enormous Gnostic future still
<br>
to be played out.
<br>
<p>Several very good essays on this very book are contained in my recent fat
<br>
anthology of fiction and essays about the deep future, EARTH IS BUT A STAR
<br>
(Perth, Australia: University of Western Australia Press), especially Dr
<br>
Russell Blackford's piece. Another version of Russell's essay appeared even
<br>
more recently in the excellent monthly zine THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF SCIENCE
<br>
FICTION, `Technological Meliorism and the Posthuman Future: Arthur C.
<br>
Clarke and the Ultimate Future of Intelligence', NYRSF Nov 2001, No. 159.
<br>
<p>BTW, I once asked Arthur by email how he pronounced Diaspar: was it
<br>
DIRE-spar or Dye-ASS-puh. He said: Yes. :)

<br>
Greg beat me for the rights to do the sequel... damn it]
