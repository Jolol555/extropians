I found it in the magazine 'Frontiers' way back in 1999.
<br>
I quote;
<br>
'A man left completely paralysed after a heart attack is once again
<br>
communicating with the outside world, thanks to a direct neural link with
<br>
his computer. Neurosurgeons at Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, have
<br>
placed an electrode inside the paralysed man's brain that enables him to
<br>
control a computer cursor by thought alone. He has become capable of
<br>
clicking on icons to make the computer say words for him, send email or even
<br>
dim the light in his room....
<br>
Another paralysed patient...also had an electrode implanted at the same time
<br>
he did.
<br>
...But what makes the Atlanta achievement special is the way they have
<br>
directly connected man and computer. Nerve cells in the patient's brain have
<br>
actually been fused directly with the specially designed electrode.
<br>
The electrode ends with a hollow glass cone about the size of the end of a
<br>
ballpoint pen. This cone was dipped in chemicals extracted from the
<br>
patient's knees which induce nerve growth. Over a few months the nerve cells
<br>
grew into the cone and eventually linked up to the electrode. The electrode
<br>
interprets and transmits neural signals to a reciever outside of the scalp.
<br>
There are no wires going through the skin, and the electrode has no internal
<br>
power source; it is powered by an induction coil in his head.'
<br>
The leading neurosurgeon is Dr. Roy E. Bakay.
<br>
<p>Has anybody heard any more about this since?
