In a message dated 2/3/02 10:12:11 PM, <a href="mailto:phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu?Subject=Re:%20Why%20life%20is%20unfair%20for%20so%20many...">phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu</a> writes, in 
<br>
relevant part:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does the ability to earn money really vary by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factor of a million from person to person, in their own right?  How much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of that variance is from the person, and how much from the position in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society they happen to occupy, which any non-moron could exploit?  If a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lot comes from the position (no one would say it all does, but a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might), then we could contemplate a society with fewer bottlenecks to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occupied by lottery.  (Or more but less lucrative ones.)
</em><br>
<p>Plainly, societal infrastructure plays a necessary but not sufficient role in 
<br>
creating large inequalities in wealth.  Among hunter-gatherers, even someone 
<br>
twice as smart, strong, and liked as his peers will not own billions more in 
<br>
assets than his peers.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, I'm at a loss for hard measures of the relative influence of 
<br>
chance, innate ability, acquired virtues, and societal infrastructure in 
<br>
creating disparities in wealth.  Perhaps social scientists can measure such 
<br>
things; I cannot say, as it is not my field of study.  But I wax skeptical.
<br>
<p>At any rate, it seems to me that no one can intelligently address 
<br>
inequalities in wealth unless and until they make clear whether they care 
<br>
about inequality per se or simply poverty.  If the latter, they will have to 
<br>
answer very hard questions about why we should care about inequality and how 
<br>
we justify forcibly redistributing wealth.
<br>
<p>I've found that most people care about inequality per se because, ultimately, 
<br>
they fear envy.  Note that I do not say &quot;feel&quot; envy; in my experience, 
<br>
outrage about inequality comes mostly from those who have relatively great 
<br>
wealth (though that perhaps reflects the media I consume).  Helmut Shoeck 
<br>
wrote an excellent book, ENVY, about the important role that poisonous 
<br>
feeling plays in cultures and economies.  I won't reprise his argument here, 
<br>
but I do strongly encourage interested parties to look into the work.
<br>
<p>Regarding justifications for forcibly redistributing wealth, I think most r
<br>
eaders of this list know how the arguments go and long ago decided which they 
<br>
prefer to follow.
