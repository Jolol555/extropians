<em>&gt; Animals have been aware of themselves for a very long time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly the parts of the brain that deal with fear, love, pleasure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and pain are very old; but it took another 400 million years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimentation before evolution invented true intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the creativity it produces.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so that means that evolution is quite creative, having invented true
<br>
intelligence long before humans ever thought of inventing something similar
<br>
(AI)... and of course, evolution is not sentient, so it's evident that
<br>
creativity can function independently of sentience.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't have creativity without intelligence and you can't have

intelligence
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're wrong, somebody does pay me for that.
</em><br>
<p>Come on, John, I don't believe that anyone pays you just for being sentient.
<br>
You can have creativity without sentience, since evolution created you, and
<br>
evolution hasn't any genuine intelligence. You *can* have intelligence without
<br>
sentience, since John Koza has reported that AI has solved problems, yet
<br>
genetic algorithms aren't sentient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you were the one who said the poetry writing program was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-sentient, how do you know?
</em><br>
<p>The poetry-writing programs do not *claim* to be sentient.
<br>
Do you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure, but non-sentient beings apparently can't act like sentient ones,
</em><br>
<p>Well, there's Al Gore...
<br>
©¿©¬
<br>
<p><em>&gt; at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least that's what evolution is telling us.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution tells us how life evolved, that's all. If we build non-sentient
<br>
beings that act like sentient ones, it matters not at all to the algorithms,
<br>
organic chemistry, and Darwinian mechanisms that produced life (including our
<br>
own).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; Superlative sentience is ended the moment the brain is disturbed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;by thought,  which contaminates the purity of awareness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then I never want to achieve &quot;superlative sentience&quot;, it sounds rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pedestrian, just like another run of the mill drug induced stupor.
</em><br>
<p>Superlative sentience (total awareness) can't be &quot;achieved,&quot; so you don't have
<br>
to worry about achieving it. It emerges spontaneously, and is like nothing
<br>
that the brain can imagine, because it coincides with direct experience of
<br>
reality, just the opposite of induced stupor.

<br>
<em>&gt; After all sentience is much easier to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve than creativity.
</em><br>
<p>If sentience is easier to achieve than creativity, then sentience naturally
<br>
precedes creativity.
<br>
So, then what created the sentience?
<br>
Obviously, creativity precedes sentience, otherwise evolution could never
<br>
create sentience.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,

analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual

uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
