From: &quot;Geraint Rees&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:g.rees@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20Aid%20for%20Afghanistan">g.rees@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; previous US involvement in Afghanistan has certainly contributed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current undesirable situation.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree, because previous US involvement in Afghanistan has helped to
<br>
expose the terrorists, who would otherwise have remained hidden and secretly
<br>
plotting their malignant and murderous crimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This suggests that risk assessment was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faulty,
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, the outcome of this war continues to show that it is better
<br>
to destroy terrorism rather than try to appease it. The world is safer without
<br>
organized religious fanaticism such as the Taliban and Al Quaida.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and suggests that at least as much attention should be paid to long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term outcomes as short term gain.
</em><br>
<p>In this case, &quot;short term gain&quot; equates to trying to appease the terrorists.
<br>
Long term gain means ridding the world of terrorists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that this applies whatever the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation; we pay politicians &amp; diplomats for such foresight;
</em><br>
<p>We pay the Commander in Chief to wage whatever war is necessary to preserve
<br>
the Constitution and integrity of the US. He has performed admirably, don't
<br>
you agree?
<br>
Let's applaud him: &quot;Keep up the good work, Mr. President.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; marines are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones who kill others before they kill us.
</em><br>
<p>Ahem...
<br>
In case it has escaped your notice, let me point out that the President is the
<br>
top Marine.
<br>
The marines do *not* act independently of the government (&quot;politicians &amp;
<br>
diplomats&quot;).
<br>
War is diplomacy carried on by other means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Leaving 'why' to the next decade was dangerous in the 1980s as we can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the luxury of hindsight;
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense, the 80s had no equivalent act of terrorism to that of 9-11, and to
<br>
conflate US policy in the 80s with the kind of murderous acts of the Taliban
<br>
and Al Quaida is just plain ignorant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see that it is any less dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.
</em><br>
<p>Today the world is a safer place due to US action against terrorists.
<br>
If the kind of passive denial that you advocate were to prevail, the
<br>
terrorists would go on terrorizing the whole world, and by now they might even
<br>
have carried out their vow to destroy Israel. But then, perhaps that's what
<br>
you secretly want to happen.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
