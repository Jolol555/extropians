The fundamrntalism of which the authior writes about is Islamic 
<br>
fundamentalism. This is what this new war is all about, as the author noted. 
<br>
Consider the conjecture that WW3 has already happend, with the 
<br>
western/republics/oligoplolies/capitalists winning, circa 1991.  Consider the 
<br>
conjecture that this is WW4, the struggle against Islamic fundamentalist as 
<br>
funded by the Saudi Wahabbis, Muslims Brotherhood, and a hodge-podge of other 
<br>
fundamentalist interests, including dear-old Saddam, and the Iranian 
<br>
ayatollahs. 
<br>
<p>So, this is like a combination of the Cold War, with all its subtrfuge, mixed 
<br>
in with terrorism versus military strikes, and what I suspect will soon be 
<br>
assasinations. Just as life didn't stop during the Cold War, neither will 
<br>
modern life in West. But the war will go on. Not a comforting thought, but we 
<br>
as a species will survivr and thrive and the Islamists will be made to fall, 
<br>
eventually. A Modus Vivendi may occur when power is harnessed by reason. But 
<br>
we may have to prepare ourselves for a bloody-awful fight(s). 
<br>
<p>JoeDees quoting Lisa Lindburg:
<br>
&lt;&lt; Tibi himself commutes between West and East as a sort of messenger of 
<br>
peace and is among a handful of prominent Muslim intellectuals who are 
<br>
demanding the separation of religion and politics. He views the events in 
<br>
September as a considerable setback. “Today, I must admit that the 
<br>
fundamentalists’ war—up until now a war of values—has taken on a military 
<br>
dimension that has manifested itself in the jihad-soldier’s terrorism.” &gt;&gt;
