<p>Storing. Computation can be assumed to be reversible, with the exception

of the irreversible bit erasures costing energy. I used classical bits,

since I was thinking of long-term storage - qubits aren't known for
<br>
their persistence. 
<br>
<p>A more quantum approach would be to use the Bekenstein bound. Assume we
<br>
have a radius R, mass M system. That allows us to store kMR bits in
<br>
quantum states. So if we use the same analysis as before,
<br>
kMR(1-f)=fMc^2/kTln2, producing the optimal f= kR/(kR+c^2/kTln2). kR is
<br>
a huge number for macroscopic R, again producing a f~=1.

<p>I assumed &quot;simply&quot; lossless conversion into energy. Clearly a more

careful analysis has to take the entropy change of matter -&gt; energy
<br>
conversion into account and could perhaps calculate limiting efficiency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Qubit based technology seems to require cryogenic environments, whereas

</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a fun optimization problem. Given a number of small spheres
<br>
with blackbody heat emissions, which distribution minimizes average
<br>
distance for a given temperature bound?
<br>
<p>If then spheres have radius r and disspiation W, the heat balance
<br>
of sphere i becomes  
<br>
<p>W + sum_j 4 pi^2 sigma T_j^4 r^3 / R_ij^2 = 4 pi sigma r T_i^4
<br>
<p>(essentially a radiosity equation; I think I have oversimplified it a
<br>
bit by assuming R &gt;&gt; r). R_ij is the distance between sphere i and j. So
<br>
we need to find the configuration that minimizes sum_ij R_ij and where
<br>
max T_i &lt; T_max. I would probably solve this by a genetic algorithm or
<br>
hillclimbing, but I don't have the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have M kilograms of matter and use the fraction f to produce

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; x/(x+c^2/kTln2). If x is 10^24 bits/kg (molecular matter storage) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; T=3 K, I get f=3.2e-16. On the other hand, for x 10^50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (nuclear storage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; close to the Bekenstein bound) f~=1.  In the first case the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is so bad at storing information that you cannot use much of it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; energy, since you will run out of storage. In the second case you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cram a lot of info into it, so you don't need much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The breakpoint is at x=3.13e39 bit/kg, I guess around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; degenerate matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We don't know if degenerate matter (gravitation-stabilized, I presume?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That would make it essentially a flat spherical assembly around a core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise useless but for energy generation)  offers sufficient structural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety to build computational machinery.
</em><br>
<p>True. I think degenerate matter offers enough stability to store
<br>
information (C12/C13 nuclei in a lattice), but it is not obvious how to
<br>
do processing in it. Even worse for nuclear matter. 
<br>
<p>Hmm, just a realization: my above argument implies that if the supercivs
<br>
are using nuclear densities, they will be highly visible by their energy
<br>
dissipation. But if you can't use neutronium for storage, then they will
<br>
likely be in the quiet region. So this provides a prediction that
<br>
nuclear matter may not be suitable for storage if we assume the
<br>
existence of supercivs, since otherwise they would be visible.
