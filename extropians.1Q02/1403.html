But I dont see why it has not yet been invented.  As a mechanical
<br>
problem it seems soluble, and the market for such a machine would
<br>
be enormous, specifically among the extremely aged.  Seems to
<br>
me we could figure out a way to attach some kind of device to
<br>
the genitals of a severely handicapped or ancient person, then
<br>
operate it along with a really good virtual reality.  We could make
<br>
it really fun to be really old.  Being 90 could be a real hoot.

<p>Spike, just give it time! lol  But, I think such old and handicapped people would get trampled over by the hordes of lonely young to middle-aged, able-bodied men who wanted the experience!!  I think such a gizmo could over the longterm lead to a great deal more loneliness, isolation and frustration with the reality of one's life.

<p>I have a feeling that if your idea is ever fully implemented, we will find the Scandinavian nations doing it.  So, Anders in around the year 2063 should be having a great time as an old geezer! ;)  Of course, by than he will have become an immensely powerful posthuman with much better things to do!
<br>
<p>Eliezer said at one time(to paraphrase), &quot;other people can have their upload sexual fantasies enacted over and over again if they want, but what I desire is to really learn about the universe around me!
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
