</em><br>
<p>I think it is wrong to identify transhumanism with the technology part.
<br>
Mark is right in pointing at it as an distinguishing aspect of
<br>
transhumanism, but it is not enough to distinguish transhumanism in any
<br>
reasonable sense of the word from many other views. It is also very easy
<br>
to be made obsolete as technology develops.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As Fabio suggested, we could abandon the use of the word &quot;transhumanism&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signify a world-view, instead use it to describe the attitude towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, the central meme in pure form. It's useful to have a term to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe this attitude in separation from the ethical systems in which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be embedded, since it allows the formation of temporary goal-oriented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalitions with groups which do not share a long-range outlook (you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still exclude nazis, though, not because they are &quot;un-transhuman&quot; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they are nazi). Thus transhumanist goals could be better advanced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appealing to a larger number of persons, and only later, as we get closer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving our goals, could the specific flavors of transhumanism be sorted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly the idea I think is dangerous. 
<br>
<p>First, how do you motivate the exclusion of nazis? You cannot motivate
<br>
it by saying they are not transhuman, so you have to motivate it from
<br>
some other core values, or in that while their views are acceptable
<br>
views they hurt the movement in a practical political sense. Even worse,
<br>
what about the people who claim to be liberal democrats but advocate
<br>
government run eugenics programs? They are not nazis, so you cannot
<br>
exclude them for their ideology, and if they promise to promote their
<br>
policies discreetly and professionally so that nobody gets upset, will
<br>
you then agree that they are acceptable? And if damaging the movement by
<br>
having weird views is a problem, then what about us libertarians who
<br>
have the outrageous idea that less government and taxes will solve a lot
<br>
of problems?
<br>
<p>Second, and I think this is a more severe problem, is that trying to
<br>
appeal to a lot of people by having more diluted values or ideology will
<br>
mean that you get more people importing their own favorite ideologies
<br>
into the movement and more people who don't get understand whatever
<br>
central values there are and are more into it for the community or
<br>
networking. As an example, compare this list now with how it was several
<br>
years back in terms of actual idea production: the huge increase in
<br>
diversity of people on the list has not led to an increase in quality or
<br>
even quantity of ideas. Some of the old issues of Extropy are composed
<br>
to a large extent of threads from the list, with amazing insight and
<br>
creativity. 
<br>
<p>Third, what use are the masses? I notice again and again that people try
<br>
to make transhumanism appealing to everybody, so that lots of people
<br>
will flock to its banner. But washed out ideologies not saying anything
<br>
has never appealed to anybody - in fact, many of the most successful
<br>
political movements have had narrowly defined programs. But I question
<br>
the point in having a million members in WTA or ExI if their membership
<br>
doesn't *mean* anything. A far more successful strategy is to create a
<br>
real world view (and a world-view is far more than a view of
<br>
technology!), make the intellectuals and cultural leaders recognize it
<br>
and then watch the mainstream move in your direction. It has worked
<br>
well in the past.
<br>
<p>Note that these issues are not new. Every political movement the last
<br>
200 years have had these problems. Those that solved them prospered,
<br>
those that didn't vanished. The socialists remained a marginal group
<br>
composed of eternally squabbling and fantasising factions until various
<br>
sub-groups got their internal houses in order, then they became major
<br>
political forces or took over entire nations. As the joke in the Swedish
<br>
social democrat party goes: &quot;How do you tell who is a social democrat?
<br>
By the method of exclusion&quot;. I'm not saying we need to throw out
<br>
everybody not agreeing 100% with the party line, but there better be
<br>
*some* ideology beyond &quot;cool technology is coming&quot; to define a
<br>
transhumanist unless we actually want to relegate ourselves to the
<br>
trashheap of history. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the end, we are not really arguing about ideas here but rather which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words should be used to describe which idea. The  naming scheme which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most intuitve and easiest to use without confusion, should win.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. I think it is a very large probability that by the end of this
<br>
year I will not refer to myself as a transhumanist.
