<em>&gt;From: James Rogers &lt;jamesr@be&gt;

<em>&gt;Subject: Re: Jaron Lanier Got Up My Shnoz on AI
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You have a very strange notion of computation.  The brain does have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processes doesn't it?  You either mean something very different from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what you just said, or you aren't making any sense.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But the brain processes are nothing like von N.  finite state computers!
<br>
For a start synapses can rewire (in hardware, infinite-state) in response
<br>
to situations &amp; problems. Do you deny this? And what brain structures
<br>
resemble anything like CPU or RAM chips? None, because brains
<br>
and brain processes are nothing like ordinary computers (doh).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Input and output results are all you need to duplicate ANY finite state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machinery.  Universal FSM copying algorithms create structures that look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very similar to neural networks, not like the more conventional algorithms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that most people who work with software are familiar with.  With &quot;weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;states&quot; and everything. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What about hidden units??  All that serial computers can do is model 
<br>
or simulate mpd function ... the lock-step mechanism cannot be replicated
<br>
exactly in serial because in parallel all nodes are updated AT ONCE, this
<br>
is why it is called parallel, whereas lock-step simulation in serial just does 
<br>
one process at a time, linearly. And, again, what about hidden units?????
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; These are programs/algorithms in every sense of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word; just because you aren't used to seeing algorithms expressed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something approximating an efficient Kolmogorov form doesn't mean that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structure isn't an algorithm.  I *am* used to looking at algorithms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been reversed engineered into these forms, and while very different,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proper analysis can be learned.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Not only different, but nothing like! You can't go the other way and extract
<br>
the &quot;algorithm&quot; being used by brains because the brain changes its wiring not
<br>
just weight states. Also, how can u reproduce graceful degradation in serial?
<br>
If the bit stream is disrupted u r f**c**d!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sorry James, but 'ordinary' von Neumann machines will never be sentient.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I hope you have a rational reason for that assertion.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All you can get from improved serial is more speed .. but speed of calculation
<br>
has absolutely zilch to do with sentience/ felt experience. My z80 is slower
<br>
by a magnitude than a P4, but is not a jot more or less sentient!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Forget finite-state hardware ... the distinction between virtual (phantom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in MVT parlance) and &quot;physical&quot; (either E1-brain or silicon) is crucial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i&gt;n this debate since we are discussing 'felt' experience, not computation.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Occam's razor would be drawing much blood from your theories.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Put up or shut up. MVT is the simplest (thus best according to Occam)
<br>
theory explaining a wide range of phenomena using minimum terms. If u
<br>
think it is wrong, pray explain what premises or conclusions you object to?
<br>
<p>I await any manifestation of a finite-state sentient computer
<br>
with baited breath (yawn), but meantime will carry on with my own work.
<br>
And by the way, I don't think that standard neural nets as they exist now
<br>
are sufficient for sentience either, though are a necessary part (they are
<br>
from work on reverse engineering of the brain after all).
