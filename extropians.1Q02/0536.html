<p>Yes, that is correct.  Our vision of a better future makes no appeal to
<br>
prescribing a supposedly ideal form of political organization for society;
<br>
as far as we're concerned human politics are a temporary means to a
<br>
transhuman end, with any transhuman organizational forms being subject to
<br>
the final opinion of the transhumans.  It doesn't get much more apolitical
<br>
than that.

<p><em>&gt; Re: the millenial impulse and the Singularity. Personally I confess to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millenial inspiration and longing, and see no shame in it. It has a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history, and is present in every culture. Atheists express it in many ways,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as in Marxism. It is a sociological observation not an epithet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, among the varieties of millenial expression, the most common is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-millenialist who sees the vast majority of people as the damned,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemned to perish in the tribulations, while the elect are taken up. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-millenialist, among which I would place you Eliezer, believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millenium can only be established by working hard to make this world the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kingdom. This is for instance the Buddhist eschatological vision: the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes rich and fruitful, living in peace, ruled by a just government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which then withers and renounces authority when the next Buddha comes.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Millennial apocalyptism&quot; does not sound like a description of a
<br>
human-universal emotion.  It sounds like a description of a cultural
<br>
tradition, with particular appeal to the tradition of a God that thinks in
<br>
base-ten round numbers.  If what you mean is the human-universal hope for
<br>
a better world, then please pick a descriptive term other than &quot;millennial
<br>
apocalyptism&quot;.  Frankly, it is impossible for me to interpret your paper's
<br>
current comments on the Singularity as having any friendly meaning (see
<br>
below for the relevant quotes).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I don't think the material reality of the Singularity means that many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are not inspired and effected by the millenial traditions when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come to learn about Singularitarian possibilities.
</em><br>
<p>The material reality of the Singularity means that no appeal to the
<br>
millennial traditions is necessary.  I explicitly reject such appeal as
<br>
harmful on the rare occasions when someone on the SL4 email list attempts
<br>
it.  Reading your paper (and Bozeman, whom you quote) clearly shows that
<br>
millennial apocalyptism is being considered as a memetic source of
<br>
nonfactual and counterfactual input into the Singularity meme, and not as
<br>
the source of humanist ends in conjunction with technological means.
<br>
<p>I here re-quote your paper:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are occasional discussions on the extropian list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the potential downsides or catastrophic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of emerging technologies, but these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are generally waved off as being either easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remediable or acceptable risks given the tremendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewards. This form of argumentation is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable since most extropians have adopted a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of millennial apocalyptic which they call “the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity.”
</em><br>
<p>In other words, you appeal to millennial apocalyptism as the putative
<br>
source of beliefs which you believe to be both false and harmful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the roots of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity idea are in the transcultural millenarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impulse; the Singularity is a vision of techno-Rapture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for secular, alienated, relatively powerless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techno-enthusiasts (Bozeman, 1997).
</em><br>
<p>Again, it's hard to see this as anything except an attack on the
<br>
Singularity meme via an attempt to explain it solely through reference to
<br>
impulses and emotions which have no basis in fact.
<br>
<p>[Further quotes return to the replied-to message.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re: Extrop List politics: I understand from some of the responses I received
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have missed a set of serious political discussions on the list that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revealed that the vocal libertarians are in fact (at least now) a minority.
</em><br>
<p>No, they're not.  &quot;Libertarian&quot; simply doesn't have the connotations you
<br>
think it does.  There are a few people who are both libertarian and
<br>
profoundly unenlightened; these people's views are not shared by either
<br>
the other libertarian transhumanists nor the conservative, liberal, or
<br>
socialist transhumanists.  We've had some vocal and profoundly
<br>
unenlightened liberal/socialist transhumanists on this mailing list too,
<br>
by the way, so please don't go blaming it on libertarianism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm happy to hear libertarian views, have learned a lot from them, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become more libertarian as a result. Its not that I don't want to hear from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarians, I just don't want to be flamed off by them. For instance Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lorrey's response to my essay:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't you recognise who he is talking about? Anyone who thinks his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'vision' of a &quot;sexy, democratic future&quot; run by his social democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (i.e. bolshevik) ideology is a dumb idea is 'obviously' part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alleged 'neo-nazi wing' of transhumanism. Before you can send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone off to reeducation camps, you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; properly identify them as members of a 'well documented'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; counter-revolutionary cabal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...this is rather typical of what I have encountered on the list in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past.
</em><br>
<p>Mike Lorrey is one of the three people whose enormously voluminous posts I
<br>
was trying to counteract with the &quot;one humanity, all in the same boat&quot;
<br>
thread.  This is an aggressively open, uncensored, unmoderated list, and
<br>
even if it weren't, quoting one opinion would *still* prove nothing.  I
<br>
think you are reasoning from rather subjective data here!  Maybe these
<br>
opinions &quot;jump out&quot; at you because nobody would ever express them at all
<br>
in most fora you're used to, but this represents a wider *variance* among
<br>
transhumanists, a wider distribution, not a distribution skewed towards
<br>
one end of the curve; you're just noticing the messages from one end of
<br>
the curve because, frankly, you happen to find those messages morally
<br>
offensive and therefore highly salient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You, and Nick Bostrom BTW, assert that Nazi transhumanism is an oxymoron.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But a central point of my essay, and a point expressed by many, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, i.e. the idea that human beings should be able to improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves radically through technology, does not have much intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political content. It is probably imcompatible with theocracy, although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bet a theocracy could prove us wrong (maybe the Scientologists). And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racialism is bad science. But I don't think it makes sense to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply because most transhumanists are anti-Nazi that transhumanists can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be Nazis.
</em><br>
<p>I think that perhaps you fail to appreciate the historical context of Nazi
<br>
ideology.  See for example my post &quot;MEME: History, Nazis, and &gt;H&quot; in Dec
<br>
1999, which I quote (slightly cleaned up) here:
<br>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After reading _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_, I've realized that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the claimed association between &quot;transhuman&quot; and &quot;Nazi Germany&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is based on a historical misconception.  As far as I can tell, the Nazis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never tried to create a new superior race; never even claimed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolving into one.  Rather, the Nazi philosophy was that there was an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aryan ideal, the &quot;blond beast of prey&quot;, which had existed at some point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past until it was corrupted by mixing with lesser races.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were trying to *breed back to that*, not breed forward to a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity.  Transhumanism, which deals with shareable technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augmentation rather than eugenics, has essentially no point of contact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've therefore done my best to create the following one-minute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countermeme to the whole concept of transhumanism bearing even a vague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resemblance to the Nazis:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ==
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Historically, the Nazi philosophy was that they were protecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing Aryan ideal from racial corruption.  Despite the common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misconception, they never tried to create supermen.  They just claimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be supermen.  And that's the key difference.  That's *always* the key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference.  That's what separates the Spanish Inquisition, which burned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heretics in the defense of what they thought was the truth, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, which tries to discover new truths and share them with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.  It's the difference between claiming to be perfect, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad, and trying to be better, which is good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanists don't claim to be transhumans.  We're just ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mortals, and we know it, but we want to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanity and share it with everyone - or at least offer everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opportunity.  History teaches us to beware of claims to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute truth - not to be wary of truth itself, or of the quest for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.  History teaches us to be wary of those who claim to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superior race.  But that says nothing about the quest for transhumanity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor about actual transhumans.
</em><br>
<p>So the claim that Nazism and transhumanism are fundamentally opposed is
<br>
not just a reflexive defense; there is some nonobvious philosophical and
<br>
historical depth to it.
<br>
<p>(This is also, BTW, why I'm such a pedant whenever someone uses the word
<br>
&quot;transhuman&quot; in place of &quot;transhumanist&quot;.)
