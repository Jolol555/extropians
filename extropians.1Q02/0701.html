<p><em>&gt; &gt; You can fuse iron atoms, but the reaction is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; endothermic. So when this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happens, the star core cools. There are other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nuclear processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; involving iron too, and all are endothermic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hence tend to cool the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; star, causing it to compress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm no astrophysicist either,...but consider.  Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has an iron core.  The asteroid belt has asteroids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are largely iron.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iron is abundant in the solar system.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, so far I've managed to avoid biting my own leg off *and* entering this
<br>
thread. Now it's one or the other.
<br>
<p>I'm an astrophysicist. My first Masters was based on work on metallicity in
<br>
stars (pop III stuff) and acting as translator for eccentric old stellar
<br>
modellers.
<br>
<p>The composition and behavior of stellar bodies is well understood. Has been
<br>
for fifty years -- everything after 1950 has been refinements in the math,
<br>
understanding in how phase changes propagate through stellar plasmas,
<br>
electromagnetic field and energy transport behavior in the atmosphere of
<br>
stars, physics of supernovae. You still look at 1920's groundwork if you
<br>
want to get work done on how the bulk of a star hangs together.
<br>
<p>Stars are very, very different from planets. Plasma works very differently
<br>
from the other forms of matter. The laws of physics, even in very simple
<br>
form, lead quite clearly to non-intuitive behavior inside stars, the results
<br>
of which are easily observed at the various emission layers, burning zones
<br>
and phase changes. Change, even slightly, what is going on in an inner layer
<br>
of the star, and you'll see potentially very divergent results at the
<br>
surface -- some of the governing equations are non-linear.
<br>
<p>When modelling a star, only two things matter: 1) how much mass it has, 2)
<br>
how much stuff that isn't hydrogen or helium it has; these two items operate
<br>
in conjunction to determine density, pressure (due to radiation and
<br>
otherwise) and equilibrium points. A non-collapsed, stable star is seriously
<br>
metalled up if it has 2% of it's mass as metals (= anything that isn't H or
<br>
He).
<br>
<p>As I recall, the sun hasn't started it's helium burning phase in earnest
<br>
yet, nor has it exhausted the hydrogen in the core. This means that the core
<br>
of the sun is still pretty much H/He. I forget the exact percentages arrived
<br>
at through simulation. Go google.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question of the putative iron core of the sun was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of fun to mull over.
</em><br>
<p>A much more interesting question (up until last year in any case) would be
<br>
how to prove that there isn't a black hole at the core of the sun,
<br>
surrounded by a fairly large sphere of high-energy, very low density plasma.
