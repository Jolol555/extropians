<p><em>&gt; Right now, there are six billion people alive in the world.  Even if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is delayed until 2025, I doubt there will be more than seven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or eight billion people alive at the time.  That's less than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-Singularity human for each star in the Milky Way.  In a billion years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will *still* be, at most, six billion entities who were uniquely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alive before the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really need to postulate that we are a small group among that six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think most of you have missed the real problems with surviving.  Money.
<br>
<p>The first uploads and maintained will probably be expensive.  The first
<br>
problem will be with thieves who can't afford the technology.  There will be
<br>
cases of people stealing storage nodes so they can delete the previous
<br>
occupant and upload themselves.
<br>
<p>That problem will eventually be solved by security.  But security (and just
<br>
the storage) brings a second problem: continued cash flow.  It will cost
<br>
money to be stored.  When you run out of money, the storage company will
<br>
&quot;evict&quot; (read delete) you.  Once you are stored, and cannot touch the real
<br>
world, how many of you could still make money?  I don't know if I could.
<br>
Most of my money comes from programming on top-secret projects.  Those
<br>
projects do not allow data in or out.  (I don't want a two man review of
<br>
every meme in my existence to exit the facility!)  I may not be allowed into
<br>
my workplace anymore.  And I'm the lucky one.  Anyone who touches the real
<br>
world, like a doctor or athlete, will no longer be able to work at their
<br>
profession.
<br>
<p><p><p>A secondary problem will be a religious / philosophical question that has
<br>
already surfaced here:  The legal question of whether the &quot;copy&quot; is the
<br>
original or has rights of the original.  You may find that once your body is
<br>
destroyed, current laws will not grant you rights.  You may not be able to
<br>
stop the body-survivors from turning you off, merely for no other reason
<br>
than they do not believe that you are really in the machine.
<br>
<p>This is also another reason that many people will not choose survival.  Not
<br>
because they don't want to survive, but because they don't see it as
<br>
survival at all.
<br>
