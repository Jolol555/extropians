<p><em>&gt;I agree. In many ways I consider it the ideal this list should strive

towards.&lt;

<p>An inspiring painting in many ways, especially in its embodiment of High Italian Renaissance classicism. One day, perhaps I'll do a modern impression of the &quot;School of Extropy&quot; where transhumanists (male, female, transgender, nongender, agender, etc.) converge on the steps of reason embodying the Transhuman Enlightenment. It could be accompanied by Extropic music produced by E.Shaun and Emlyn.  Better yet, it would be great if Bill Viola (videographer of enormous talent) created a looping video image of a few minutes of movement and dialogue among transhumanists and &quot;Primo 3M+&quot; joining in the discussions amongst other transhumanists discussing the advancement of humanity. 
<br>
<p>By the way, &quot;School of Athens&quot; evidences the use of encryption in the early arts (finger print, symbol or other marks to convey a message or their signature), which continues today in modern digital mediums. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Several hand prints that date from the time of the fresco's execution were found in an almost straight line across it at the height of the shafts of the pilasters. Although a detailed analysis of the fingerprints has not yet been undertaken, one hand must almost certainly be Raphael's. The others could belong to his assistants or to visitors on the scaffold.&quot;
