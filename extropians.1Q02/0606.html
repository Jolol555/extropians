<br>
<em>&gt; Trying to brand any transhumanist organization with a negatively intended
</em><br>
political smear is certainly both yellow-dog and ignominious.  Whereas I
<br>
don't think that WTA would do something this foolish, especially in light of
<br>
the support ExI has given to it since its inception,  and I sincerely don't
<br>
think this is WTA's intention.  But, if the intention of WTA is to say &quot;ExI
<br>
members and other extropian transhumanits are the political bad guys and WTA
<br>
folks are clean faced political good guys, then I think WTA could be making
<br>
a very bad marketing decision.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Natasha you are indeed right. This is not the WTA's intention. In hindsight
<br>
at least, James might have been better to preface his post here with the
<br>
remark that the essay is not a WTA position paper.  Indeed, as he explained
<br>
yesterday, it was the writing of the paper that brought him to the WTA. The
<br>
transhumanist family is small enough, we certainly do not want anything as
<br>
human, all too human, as politics to divide us.:) The family metaphor is a
<br>
bit more than it may seem when you look at the current WTA executive
<br>
committee:
<br>
<p>Ziana Astralos
<br>
Nick Bostrom
<br>
James Hughes
<br>
Eugene Leitl
<br>
Dave Pearce
<br>
Anders Sandberg
<br>
Mike Tredder
<br>
Mark Walker
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky
<br>
<p>Obviously this list contains the names of a few of the usual suspects around
<br>
ExI. James has been serving as interim Chair but we have not elected a Chair
<br>
as of yet. (Whoever is elected Chair will be from this motley crew).
<br>
E
<br>
<em>&gt; Again, transhumanism is not based on politics or any political agenda and
</em><br>
it would do the transhumanist community and the advancement of transhumanism
<br>
a great disservice to start tossing political jabs for special effects.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I couldn't agree more. The only gain here will be in the entropy of the
<br>
universe. Cheers, Mark.
