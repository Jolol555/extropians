</em><br>
<p>This is a very interesting thought experiment, but it might be too
<br>
thoroughly grounded in current limitations. If the enhancement were as
<br>
drastic as deafness =&gt; hearing, maybe the kids would not feel (or at least
<br>
express) *contempt* so much as kindly pity. (Some adolescents are like that
<br>
now, and maybe it's just as nettling.) 
<br>
<p>But the real crux is whether their alleged insights are transmissible. If
<br>
they see that QT and relativity are simply, even laughably, wrong, we'll
<br>
all bite our lips and follow their lead. Might it not be the same with
<br>
their social/economic insights? I'm assuming they're not actually
<br>
telepathic, Martian Nest-speakers or otherwise able to bond magically in
<br>
ways that escape us mere olde fartes. 
<br>
<p>It's noticeable that some leftish people who arrive here on the extrope
<br>
list find their views bending to the right (however inadequate that
<br>
description admittedly is), drawn by the sheer gravitational force of all
<br>
the Great Minds here who take that kind of position as demonstrable.
<br>
Similarly, people tend to bias their political reading of the world, slowly
<br>
but surely, according to their work habitus or their affinity group or even
<br>
the strong opinions of their spouse. 
<br>
<p>Granted, this is less often seen between generations in a household--but
<br>
we're talking the New Wo/Man of the Future here, among us for the first
<br>
time, dispensing superior wisdom. Would we necessarily resist it, feeling
<br>
betrayed? For a while, sure. But I was startled at how my repulsively
<br>
conservative Catholic parents (and I myself) slowly, almost undetectably,
<br>
abandoned their fear&amp;hatred of (say) homosexuality, marriage outside the
<br>
clan, eating meat on Friday, etc, as those surrounding them gradually eased
<br>
up into more generous attitudes.
