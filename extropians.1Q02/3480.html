'His discoveries were numerous and admirable; 
<br>
but he is said to have requested his friends and 
<br>
relations that, when he was dead, they would place 
<br>
over his tomb a cylinder containing a sphere, inscribing 
<br>
it with the ratio which the containing solid bears to the 
<br>
contained.'    [Plutarch, Parallel Lives: Marcellus] 
<br>
<p>Actually in his work 'On the Sphere and Cylinder' Archimedes proved 
<br>
that the ratio of the volume of a sphere to the volume of the cylinder 
<br>
that contains it is 2:3. In that same work he also proved that the ratio 
<br>
of the surface area of a sphere to the surface area of the cylinder that 
<br>
contains it, together with its circular ends, is also 2:3. 
<br>
<p>'But from Dionysius's own city of Syracuse I will summon up from 
<br>
the dust--where his measuring rod once traced its lines--an obscure 
<br>
little man who lived many years later, Archimedes. When I was questor in Sicily 
<br>
I managed to track down his grave. The Syracusians knew nothing about it, 
<br>
and indeed denied that any such thing existed. But there it was, completely 
<br>
surrounded and hidden by bushes of brambles and thorns. I remembered having 
<br>
heard of some simple lines of verse which had been inscribed on his tomb, 
<br>
referring to a sphere and cylinder modelled in stone on top of the grave. 
<br>
And so I took a good look round all the numerous tombs that stand beside 
<br>
the Agrigentine Gate. Finally I noted a little column just visible above the scrub: 
<br>
it was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder. I immediately said to the Syracusans, 
<br>
some of whose leading citizens were with me at the time, that I believed this was 
<br>
the very object I had been looking for. Men were sent in with sickles to clear the site, 
<br>
and when a path to the monument had been opened we walked right up to it. 
<br>
And the verses were still visible, though approximately the second half of each 
<br>
line had been worn away.'   [Cicero, Tusculan Disputations, V]
<br>
<p>But where is now his tomb ? No one knows ...
