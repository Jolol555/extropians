<em>&gt; it would, I think, be a good idea, I think, to write a new character for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Star Trek: Enterprise series into a script that portrays an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual with a healthy avocation of pursuit for individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization and perfection.
</em><br>
<p>In the &quot;Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda&quot; series (www.andromedatv.com) they
<br>
have another set of villains who are pursuing individual perfection:
<br>
the Nietzscheans.  Nietzscheans have genetically engineered themselves
<br>
to be strong and fast (and to have bone spike weapons on their forearms).
<br>
They are brutal and selfish, cold-heartedly intelligent, totally dedicated
<br>
to survival and reproductive success.  It was the Nietzscheans who
<br>
betrayed their comrades and led to the fall of the Commonwealth in the
<br>
series' backstory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm rather disturbed that the luddites seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have more influence in the new series, as evidenced by the presence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Sulabon race, represented by individuals who are corrupted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil time travellers in the pursuit of genetic/physical/mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfection. So far we have only seen one 'good' Sulabon character in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; episode. Perhaps we need to write in a new crewman who is Sulabon and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member of the majority of Sulabon society, who pursue improvement and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfection as consensual individuals. S/he would serve on the Enterprise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a sort of scout/intelligence liason in it's continuing conflict with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time criminals.
</em><br>
<p>They do have a &quot;good&quot; Nietzschean on board the Andromeda, Tyr Anasazi,
<br>
who helps defend the ship and gets along reasonably well with the crew.
<br>
However he is an ambiguous character and the writers don't try to soften
<br>
his Nietzschean attitudes much.  He makes it clear that he is on the
<br>
Andromeda to further his own interests in survival and power.  There is
<br>
a sense that if the opportunity presented itself he would betray the
<br>
crew without a second thought if it was to his own advantage.
<br>
<p>It is hard to find positive examples of self-improvement in popular
<br>
culture, even the old-fashioned kind, success through self-education
<br>
and study and hard work.  It's ironic because in the real world you find
<br>
that many successful people raised themselves by their own bootstraps.
<br>
But fiction writers seem to prefer the notion of the aristocratic hero,
<br>
born to greatness.  Batman in the comic books built himself into a
<br>
super-human hero, but in the movies it seemed that he relied more on
<br>
his inherited wealth to buy expensive toys.
