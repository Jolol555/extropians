<p>Though, IMHO, it is not deserved. J Hughes, in his writings and shows,
<br>
demonstrates to me in how he so skillfully attempts to discredit anyone
<br>
who opposes his socialist politics as a 'Nazi' or 'Extremist', as well
<br>
as his demonstrated petulance at not being paid attention to, that he is
<br>
simply an aspiring demogogue.
<br>
<p>As I've warned of in my essay &quot;It's about the Trust&quot; (

<a href="http://www.webleyweb.com/tle/libe127-20010625-03.html">http://www.webleyweb.com/tle/libe127-20010625-03.html</a>),
<br>
demogogues are the real threat to individual liberties, in how their
<br>
primary goal over time is to redefine the words that define our
<br>
political landscape, shifting the 'center' with mere talk instead of
<br>
force until we are re-enslaved as serfs to a tyrannical power without a
<br>
shot being fired.
