<p><em>&gt;And Peter responded:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A society in which a large fraction of rewards go to a handful of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; who become the best tennis player or the best movie star is a society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which in which a large number of people take big risks to become one of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; handful, and it is a society in which most of the people who make that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; attempt fail to achieve what they want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And who do they hurt when that happens?  And who benefits?  
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;They hurt mainly themselves. Whether others benefit depends very much on
<br>
the nature of the competition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the answers are that some people are sad that they didn't become the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best, and most enjoy the pursuit.  Many people benefit from the side effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the competition.  Entertainment, improved products, better prices, etc.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The extent to which people enjoy the pursuit is very dependant on the
<br>
perceived chances of success.
<br>
&nbsp;Competition to serve consumers or to serve voters produces incentives that
<br>
are better than the complete absence of those incentives or any alternatives
<br>
which don't involve free markets, but there are plenty of costs associated
<br>
with competition, and I think it is often possible to reduce the costs without
<br>
much effect on the benefits.
<br>
&nbsp;And not all competition is competition to serve people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; That's why life is so much better for everyone, including the worst off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Everyone? Do you deny that there are people who have lost their job
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; security due to economic change? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When I said everyone is better off, I didn't mean compared to their neighbors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as that is clearly impossible.  I meant compared to anyone 200 years ago or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;500 or 1000.  I don't deny that people have lost job security.  But the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in this country are filth rich by any long term measure.  The poor in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries that are relatively free have access to tremendous resources because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other people are doing their best and being rewarded for it.  
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;We can easily observe that some people are worse off than they were 10 or
<br>
20 years ago, by observing the efforts they make to avoid changes. I don't
<br>
know of any method of similar reliability that would enable us to say
<br>
what fraction of people are better off than they would have been centuries
<br>
ago, but I suspect that many aristocrats of previous centuries would not
<br>
prefer to have been born in this century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As an aside, do you think that job security is an asset that someone can own? 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;There are many possible definitions of property rights. There are probably
<br>
people with a consistent concept of property rights that treats job security
<br>
as a property right. I don't want job security to be a property right, but
<br>
I suspect some people who believe it should are rationally serving their
<br>
personal interests.
<br>
&nbsp;The average voter seems sufficiently uncertain about whether to treat
<br>
job security as a property right that there is no objective answer to
<br>
the question of whether it currently is a property right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why is it relevant to this discussion?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;It isn't very relevant to the rest of this discussion, but it seems to
<br>
be a symptom of the belief that because free markets are better than the
<br>
alternatives, we should ignore problems associated with them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  That's why the arguments in Luxury Fever imply that there are negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; externalities associated with celebrity-worship. Since I don't see any way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to internalize those externalities, I therefore believe that a moral system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which creates social pressure to make choices that reduce inequality will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; produce a nicer society than a moral system that claims inequality doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; matter. Most of the choices that affect inequality aren't as simple as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; choosing whether to worship celebrities, but that doesn't make them any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; less important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'll grant that there is something to this argument.  It doesn't seem like it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes the case for much more than subtle social pressure.  The pressure to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well, the desire to be the best at what one does have positive externalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as well.  We don't encourage people to do their best by pushing for outcomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be less dependent on results.  
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Social pressure is the only strategy that I am optimistic about. Asking
<br>
politicians, most of whom benefit from inequality of status and power, to
<br>
reduce inequality rarely produces a genuine effort to produce more egalitarian
<br>
results. But I think there are many political issues on which it ought to
<br>
influence voter opinions. For example, I would guess that the duration of
<br>
copyright protection that would maximize material wealth would be about
<br>
4 years, but that to maximize what people actually value (i.e. adding in
<br>
the benefits of equality) would require a copyright duration of a year or
<br>
so less than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Convincing people that they don't need to be as rich as Croesus to be wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by any reasonable measure seems a fine meme. 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;If by reasonable measure you mean measures that society ought to encourage,
<br>
then yes. In the absence of social pressures, I doubt that a purely selfish
<br>
measure would cause someone to loose interest in further wealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this line of argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually seems to be pushing toward convincing those who are relatively wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it's their fault that other people are unhappy.  That seems mistaken to me.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Agreed. Blaming a few scapegoats won't change incentives that result
<br>
from widespread attitudes and policies.
