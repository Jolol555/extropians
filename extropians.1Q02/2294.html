<p>I understand completely what you are saying here. How can you make a
<br>
difference, when all you can really do is to be born, rearrange atoms for a
<br>
time, then die? 
<br>
<p>It seems that, when we decide that we exist in a universe with no objective
<br>
&quot;purpose&quot; built in, we have no foundation for any choice of moral criteria.
<br>
There is no point to anything in such a scenario, by definition. 
<br>
<p>People have been claiming that you can just draw a line in the sand...
<br>
choose your own axioms for systems of purpose, morality, etc. This had been
<br>
my position until recently too, and I guess it still defacto is, given that
<br>
I have nothing to replace it.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, that seems to be a house of cards. The problem is that you
<br>
can change your mind about your fundamental axioms, and are ignoring the
<br>
question &quot;how do I choose my axioms? Why?&quot;. This underlines the fact that
<br>
these so called &quot;chosen axioms&quot; are not axiomatic after all, and are in fact
<br>
derived from somewhere else. Where? Probably an heterogenous mishmash of
<br>
prior social programming, lurking under the covers. Unsatisfactory. And when
<br>
we try to apply a structured system, like scientific inquiry, to the task,
<br>
no headway is made.
<br>
<p>People dismiss this question in general, I think, because it is very very
<br>
hard, upsetting to contemplate, and has no real impact on day-to-day life
<br>
(or so they like to delude themselves).
<br>
<p>I think I need to read a bit of philosophy to be able to make any progress
<br>
on this point.
