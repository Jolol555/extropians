<p><em>&gt;&gt;It is a perfectly satisfactory response although it doesn't `answer the

<em>&gt; Very well then. If life has no purpose, or this question has no meaning, can someone give me good reasons (with sufficient
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>The second half of &quot;life has no purpose&quot; is &quot;you are perfectly 
<br>
free to decide the purpose of your own life and live it&quot;.  You 
<br>
may be able to share a purpose with a group of people which 
<br>
increases (mostly) your ability to accomplish more ambitious 
<br>
purposes of certain types and increases your survivability 
<br>
generally.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 1) we still remain alive (or why don't we all just die?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.1) since we have so many problems, why don't we just wipe everyone out to solve all these problems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Because wiping everyone out would not solve all of our problems 
<br>
and would create a great number more.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) why we seek progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) why we insist on certain things such as freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Because without freedom you couldn't define your own purpose and 
<br>
bring it into fruition to the best of your abilities given your 
<br>
circumstances.  We seek progress because we seek more ability to 
<br>
define and live even greater purposes.  We remain alive because 
<br>
otherwise we do not remain at all.  Something is preferable over 
<br>
nothing including even the experience of nothing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can someone explain how:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) we develop ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) we derive our goals (such as freedom for all)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) we can assume that sentient AI would seek self-preservation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) we can consider such decisions with great implications such as nanotech and the singularity if we don't consider  the purpose of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>There are a number of answers to (1).  (2) was touched on 
<br>
briefly above.  (3) is a good question.  Presumably an AI would 
<br>
seek self-preservation because it had or could develop its own 
<br>
purpose. I am not sure what (4) has to do with the question of 
<br>
purpose.
