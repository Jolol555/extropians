<p>Hmmm.... Once upon a time I was a programmer.  And programmers
<br>
clearly are aware that from time to time they have to struggle
<br>
with their computers.  Does this mean when I say &quot;f...ing computer&quot;
<br>
or &quot;f...ing compiler&quot; or &quot;f...ing idiots&quot; that didn't write
<br>
the unit tests to make sure that the compiler conformed to the
<br>
bloody specification or &quot;blasted f...ing idiots&quot; that didn't
<br>
write the specification unambigiously, that I'm incapable of
<br>
reason and have lost the argument?  I rarely get a response
<br>
so I must now assume they have been following this basic approach.
<br>
<p>Damn, and I thought computers and software weren't particularly
<br>
&quot;intelligent&quot; (yet).  I mean really, after all, its for damn sure
<br>
that most humans aren't.  Aggregate list bandwidth wasting morter
<br>
shells being lobbed hither thither and yon being a clear demonstration
<br>
of that fact.  Its like the hundred years war all over again.  I wonder
<br>
when the various factions sides will finally get it that neither side can
<br>
win. The best that can be managed is to stop beating ones head against
<br>
the wall and perhaps, just maybe, minimize the collateral damage.
<br>
