<p>Thanks, and thanks to Lee for 'splainin' it better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; However, how do you explain situations like the WWII Nazi concentration camp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gas chambers, where those inline to be gassed, when their turn came to enter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dreaded chamber, would grab the person in line behind them, and throw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that person into the gas chamber in their stead.  With the armed guards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocking escape, those throwers gained a few seconds of life, but just a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds, and cringing, tearful, fearful seconds...not exactly quality time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the grandkids, either....it was a very common occurrence, however.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our &quot;visceral&quot; understanding of life is far different than our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;philosophical&quot; understanding of life...guess which one I value more...
</em><br>
<p>Gas chamber episodes of &quot;Kill HIM, not ME!&quot; panic are essentially a very
<br>
instinctual, subconcious response that I very much doubt that many
<br>
people would commit unless they had already been subjected to a few
<br>
years of concentration camp level torture...
<br>
<p>For every such instance of cowardice, I can recite many more of courage
<br>
in the face of death (been there twice already myself) where people save
<br>
other's lives at great risk to their own without a seconds concious
<br>
thought.
<br>
<p>As for my own life extension plans, I'd rather invest my life savings in
<br>
cryonic suspension than in staving off the 'old timers disease' for a
<br>
year or two. I've just gone through a year of dealing with the
<br>
grandmonsters at the end stage (grandma Burnett died a couple months ago
<br>
after years of light senility and recent hip and arm fractures, and
<br>
grandpa Burnett is still a nearly comatose alzheimers patient here in
<br>
town, and likely will be for several years), and as my grandma Lorrey
<br>
said recently, &quot;If I ever get like that, take me out behind the barn and
<br>
shoot me.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In my case, shoot me full of suspension fluid.
