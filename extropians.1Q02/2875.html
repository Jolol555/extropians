<p>
Suppose a nanocivilization sent out nanobots aboard a von Neumann probe (or
<br>
otherwise) to our &quot;lovely&quot; planet. Their mission is to destroy any evidence
<br>
gathered by humans of the galactic civilization that in fact exists out
<br>
there. Is this scenario physically possible? No doubt the nanobots would
<br>
have no problem destroying various forms of physical evidence, presumably
<br>
the nanobots could munch-up photos, computer files, etc in quick order. For
<br>
example, SETI instruments might detect hundreds or thousands of signals
<br>
every night but the nanobots destroy the evidence before it is processed.
<br>
Suppose this process is not perfect and occasionally humans become cognizant
<br>
of some evidence of the existence of ETs. The question I am wondering is
<br>
whether there is any principled reason why the nanobots could not also
<br>
selectively destroy the associated human memories.  It seems likely that a
<br>
task of this complexity would require a network of nanobots, perhaps
<br>
connected to a CPU. In fact, if the nanobots can perform this sort of
<br>
selective memory purge (and perhaps replacement) then it seems quite
<br>
possible that ETs could be visiting us here on junkets from other stars.
<br>
Imagine that they walk down the main street of your hometown. Humans might
<br>
realize for a few seconds or minutes what they have seen (i.e., ETs) but
<br>
then the nanobots set to work doing damage control, namely, memory purging
<br>
and replacing, film eating, file destroying etc. So I ask (again) is there
<br>
any principled reason you can think of that would stop selective memory
<br>
destroying by nano in humans?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is such a scenario plausible? Well, we can say at minimum that it is
<br>
logically compatible with all the evidence we now possess, since by
<br>
hypothesis
<br>
any countervailing evidence is destroyed.  This conjecture is both refutable
<br>
and confirmable. The sort of evidence that would refute this conjecture is
<br>
if we discovered the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, if SETI
<br>
succeeds for example. We can also imagine the conjecture being confirmed, if
<br>
the ETs decided one day to confess to their deception.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we rule out this conjecture with occam's razor? Maybe, maybe not. In
<br>
terms of the Fermi paradox this conjecture is a variant on what is called
<br>
the 'zoo hypothesis': we are purposely being isolated from the galactic
<br>
civilization. So the question of whether this violates occam's razor is not
<br>
so straightforward as it might seem. The alternative solutions to the Fermi
<br>
paradox are not particularly inviting or necessarily simpler in themselves,
<br>
e.g., that we are the first technological civilization out of the gate, that
<br>
ETs exist but we just have not seen them or detected them yet. It is not
<br>
always clear how to head the advice, pluralitas non est ponenda sine
<br>
neccesitate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related place the meme snatcher conjecture is relevant is in
<br>
connection with Nick Bostrom's simulation argument.
<br>
<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a> I pointed out in the initial round of
<br>
the discussion of this argument that it is simply a special case of the more
<br>
general principle that we might be created by others. Thus, one way to make
<br>
our world is to do it in a computer simulation, another would be to create a
<br>
physical world and populate it with created humans. Both logical
<br>
possibilities seem easily implemented by a technologically advanced species.
<br>
As  I pointed out at the time, obviously the physical alternative does not
<br>
look very cost-effective in terms of matter/energy utilization. But who
<br>
knows? Perhaps they choose physical implementation because of its retro
<br>
appeal, or to heed some ethical imperative, or because creating
<br>
matter/energy is no sweat for them. In any event, at the time Robin Hanson
<br>
pointed out that this probably would require building some sort of screen
<br>
around our planet or solar system. Well, the meme snatcher conjecture offers
<br>
an alternate and perhaps more cost-effective means to hide the galactic
<br>
civilization.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Mark.
