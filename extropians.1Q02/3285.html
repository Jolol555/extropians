<em>&gt; The principles do not seem to be enough to constrain an ethical system;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do not form a set of ethical axioms or constrain the basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian ethics. They certainly have ethical content, but this content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deals more with desirability of different things than the core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mechanics&quot; of an ethical system. 
</em><br>
<p>But doesn't Extropianism give us a handle by which to judge the
<br>
desirability of different world outcomes?  And doesn't this, in itself,
<br>
constitute an ethical framework?
<br>
<p>It is true that it does tell us how to get there.  Even if we agree that
<br>
extropy is a desirable goal, we may not agree about what are the best
<br>
practical decisions on a day to day basis.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Personally I would say that this is not a flaw. Extropianism rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherits the ethical underpinnings of its parent philosophies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism and humanism (a kind of philosophical object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inheritance); it is compatible with most versions of them, and does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as expressed in the principles have to redo all the immense work that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been done on expressing ethics and politics elsewhere. It is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like how Robert Nozick simply starts _Anarchy, State, Utopia_ by simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming certain rights - the book is not about deriving them, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what conclusions can be made *after* they have been derived. 
</em><br>
<p>I am not so comfortable thinking that we can graft conventional
<br>
libertarianism onto Extropianism, or that we can start with libertarian
<br>
ethics as a foundation for our Extropian ethical system.  Haven't Max
<br>
and others attempted to distance themselves from a strict libertarianism
<br>
in order to open the movement to a wider range of political philosophies?
<br>
<p>Even in the early days of this list, when most contributors were staunch
<br>
Libertarians, we explored outside the libertarian box.  We talked about
<br>
private law systems where communists who shared everything could live
<br>
and work side by side with capitalists who paid a fine for breathing
<br>
the other guy's air.  We looked at forms of anarchy which were well
<br>
beyond the libertarian mainstream.  All this was an attempt to further
<br>
Extropian goals of self transformation and expansion by giving people
<br>
maximum freedom to experiment with interpersonal relations and agreements.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One can try combining different ethical theories with extropianism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see what happens. I would say that utilitarianism and extropianism are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a very successful combination; such an extropian utilitarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would either have to be based on maximizing extropy or have to show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing personal extropy and increasing utility are identical. In any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case it would tend to run over indiviuals in the pursuit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximization, and it seems hard to combine with the self organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle in the old version of the principles. A rights based form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism seems far more consistent, although we still have to find a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derivation of rights that convinces. 
</em><br>
<p><p>One of the big question marks in the Principles which we did not explore
<br>
much is whether they should be seen as collective or individual.  When we
<br>
seek to maximize extropy, as defined by the Principles, are we trying
<br>
to do so each of us individually for ourselves, or for society and the
<br>
world as a whole?  Is my goal a world with maximal extropy, or is it a
<br>
world in which I personally have maximized my potentials?  I don't see
<br>
the Principles as giving a clear guideline for answering this question.
<br>
<p>This is perhaps the most fundamental ethical question we face.  It is
<br>
the difference between being generous and being selfish; between being
<br>
trustworthy and being a cheat; between being honest and lying for self
<br>
benefit.  If I can benefit myself by harming another, without getting
<br>
caught, should I do so?  It arguably maximizes my own potentials for
<br>
extropy, but also arguably reduces the net extropy for the two of us.
<br>
<p>Although Extropianism is often seen as an individualistic philosophy, I
<br>
think most of us would agree that from the ethical perspective, we care
<br>
about more than our own personal benefit.  We want to see a world where
<br>
the potentials promoted by Extropianism are available to as many people
<br>
as possible.  I don't know if many of us would go so far as to say that
<br>
we would sacrifice ourselves if it increased the net extropy of the world,
<br>
but we are far from being dedicated only to our own selfish goals.
<br>
<p>Of course in many cases these two extremes do not actually lead to
<br>
different strategies for day to day life.  Often we can do good by
<br>
doing well.  We behave in a trustworthy and honest and unselfish way,
<br>
and in the long run we benefit directly and personally by these actions.
<br>
So to some extent we can get away with ignoring the issue.
<br>
<p>But then for each of us there will come times when we are tested and
<br>
tempted.  You find someone's wallet with money in it; you are carrying a
<br>
load of trash to the dump and find a secluded spot where you could toss
<br>
it for free; you are offered to join an Internet pyramid scheme which
<br>
will inevitably leave the latecomers with severe losses.  Then you have
<br>
to decide whether your ethical system is just about you, or about the
<br>
world as a whole.
