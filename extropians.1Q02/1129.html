</em><br>
<p>Nice article, however I want to make a point about Robin Hanson's
<br>
article &quot;How to Live In a Simulation&quot;. You say regarding this that:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Since such simulations would be very costly, they would probably be limited in time and space. To make the simulators less likely to drop you from their simulation or end it, you should be entertaining--&quot;funny, outrageous, violent, sexy, strange, pathe
</em><br>
tic, heroic ... in a word 'dramatic.' And since the simulators may want to play famous people, you should &quot;keep famous people happy, or at least interested... and try to stay personally interesting to the famous people around you.&quot; Sounds like a typical H
<br>
ollywood cocktail party.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>I'd have to contest this view. I would instead come from the &quot;nail that
<br>
pokes out gets hammered&quot; or &quot;squeaky wheel gets the oil&quot; point of view
<br>
in this. If there are multiple beings 'playing' the simulation, then
<br>
sticking your neck out can, in fact, cause a significant risk of
<br>
personal danger. The more 'interesting' you are, it is also more likely
<br>
that at least you will piss off one of the real players, and get whacked
<br>
as a result. 
<br>
<p>In fact, we may be seeing some real evidence of this in our world. For
<br>
instance, take world leaders. A recent statistical analysis of world
<br>
leaders demonstrates that they have a low average life expectancy and
<br>
that 60% of national leaders in the 20th century died violently from
<br>
assasination or execution. If our world is indeed a simulation, then it
<br>
follows that people like world leaders, if they are not 'played' by
<br>
'real' players, stick their necks out by being &quot;funny, outrageous,
<br>
violent, sexy, strange, pathetic, heroic ... in a word 'dramatic.'&quot; and
<br>
thus attract the negative attention of the real players.
<br>
<p>Similarly, it seems, from observations of the press, that movie and
<br>
television actors have low average life expectancies, are more prone to
<br>
dying from violent and/or addictive behaviors. If they are not being
<br>
played by real players, then they may be incurring the negative
<br>
attention of them.
<br>
<p>This is the same mindset involved in one Fermi paradox explaination:
<br>
that everyone expects the universe to be a violent place, so its best to
<br>
not broadcast signals and poke out the neck of your species/world.
<br>
<p>Thus, if we are living in a simulation, the best individual course of
<br>
action is to keep one's head down, mouth shut, and just try to get
<br>
through life with as little hassle as possible. Does this sound
<br>
familiar?
