</em><br>
<p>Yeap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Underground facilities might be a project killer,
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about that.  I don't think it would be much more expensive
<br>
than an exotic location on Earth, such as the Antarctic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; plus environmental impact statements, plus the NOMC mentality (not on

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *What if a penning trap (with ah) was stolen?
</em><br>
<p>That would be a problem, but that would be a problem for aboveground
<br>
storage as well -- and it might be much easier to guard one entrance and
<br>
exit to a facility located several hundred feet undergound than multiple
<br>
ones to a facility located aboveground.  One might even detonate anti-H
<br>
underground safely if someone breaches security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *What if a demi-gram of antihydrogen turns up missing?
</em><br>
<p>Again, this can happen aboveground or even in space.  It might be much
<br>
harder in space, given that it takes a lot of cash and effort to get to
<br>
GEO -- certainly much more than to invade a mine shaft.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *What if the technology is stolen and used to generate antihydrogen in
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;peaceful&quot; antihydrogen research facility?
</em><br>
<p>It depends on who steals it and what for.  I imagine you're thinking of
<br>
terrorists getting a hold of it and doing some serious mischief.  It
<br>
would certainly be easier to use as a weapon.  One only need release
<br>
containment and the damage is done.  That's probably even less
<br>
technically diffcult than stealing a nuke and detonating it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps in L-5 of even geosynchronous orbit is the proper place for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propulsion fuel production facility?
</em><br>
<p>If that's what it's being used for -- i.e., space travel -- yes.
<br>
However, if the stuff goes off in GEO, I imagine it would destroy or
<br>
disrupt a lot of satellites.
<br>
<p>If it's not to be used for space flight, then putting it up there is
<br>
much more costly than underground, no?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lots of solar energy for acres of pv
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells, far enough away from an explosion, so that if it occured it
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; merely be a spectacular industrial accident.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about the hazards to satellites and humans in space.
<br>
Certainly at L-5, the damage would probably be nil, but closer to
<br>
Earth...  Someone here would have to crunch the numbers and make some
<br>
guesses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was only half-joking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunar surface. It would be an excellent place, unless one generated
</em><br>
something
<br>
<em>&gt; over a 1/5th of a kilogram--then watch-out.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, the need for space colonies again!
<br>
<p>Cheers!
