<p>oh, a GOPS is a Giga Operation Per Second. 1e9, 1000000000, one billion

shiny funky CPU operations of second. Modern CPUs are capable of several

GOPS.

<p><em>&gt; slightly less important, but on a similar note, could anyone give me a

</em><br>
<p>computronium is a molecular crystal, its elementary cells being little
<br>
primitive computers (each just capable of communicating with it's
<br>
neighbours, and only keeping track of a few bits). it is a hardware
<br>
implementation of a particular cellular automaton, and it is provably the
<br>
most efficient computer which can be built from matter. basically, it's a
<br>
chemical substance (not an element, as the name would seem to imply, that
<br>
would have been *too* easy) that forms a very powerful computer, if
<br>
crystallized.
<br>
<p>now, you're probably going to ask what a cellular automaton is....
