<p>Very silly.  If we aren't well into the nanotech era by 2061
<br>
(when desalination gets *much* cheaper) then we are going to
<br>
have much larger problems than water sources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem definitely does not lie with insufficient water but with
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not completely -- one can have better technology for removing salt
<br>
from water.  I believe the DOE or Dept. of Defense are actively
<br>
soliciting such proposals.  I know Israel is working in this area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; reverse osmosis or other methods to extract water from the oceans.
</em><br>
<p>I believe this is currently the least expensive method.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A possible energy source that many people had neglected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might lie with storm lighting,
</em><br>
<p>Thats a pretty unreliable source.  Better would be normal solar
<br>
energy.  Singapore has plenty of that.  Or they can easily lease
<br>
some from the Australians.  If we can move oil around the world
<br>
we can certainly move water.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without technical expertise, I hesitate to suggest using a scaled up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of an electrosis system that can mass convert water into its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; component hydrogen and oxygen as a lighting strike passes through it.
</em><br>
<p>While producing hydrogen from water is certainly the way to go in
<br>
the long term, I don't think lightening should be used as the energy
<br>
source.
<br>
<p>For fresh water, there are two ways to go.  First would be to
<br>
use the existing sodium and chloride pumps found in cells to pump
<br>
the salt (and potentially other ions using other pumps) out of the
<br>
water.  I suspect the energy costs of supplying ATP to molecular
<br>
pumps would be lower than the energy costs of reverse osmosis.
<br>
What one has to master is the assembly of think lipid bilayers,
<br>
the insertion of the protein pumps into the bilayers and the
<br>
manufacture of devices that can contain a large surface area
<br>
for the assembled lipid/protein structures.
<br>
<p>In the more distant future, one will use molecular sorters.
<br>
See Chapter 13, pages 373-386 in Nanosystems.  Using these
<br>
I expect the costs would be even cheaper.
<br>
<p>There is a paper that needs to be written here comparing
<br>
current and future water purification costs.
