<br>
<em>&gt; Well, I was merely using the term from James H. Austin's _Zen and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brain_. I think he gives a fairly definite definition of it.
</em><br>
<p>I like definite definitions, Anders...
<br>
What page is that on?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Irrationalism doesn't mean that &quot;strange stuff I can't explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens&quot;, but rather &quot;reason isn't enough&quot;. Which implies that the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of reaching my goals (whatever they may be) is not to base my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior on past and current experience and inductions from it, but on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other factors not linked in any way to this. Somehow we are supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act better if we take information with no correlation to what we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or think into account.
</em><br>
<p>James H. Austin comments on why reason is not enough:
<br>
&quot;Have we learned anything about meditation? If so, it will not be from
<br>
applying EEG electrodes to the scalp, but from the deeper act of practicing
<br>
the meditative mode ourselves and infusing it into the present moment.
<br>
Finally, each day's practice starts to become life's meditation, by one life,
<br>
within all life.&quot; (page 697)
<br>
IOW, beyond reason, direct (empirical) experience of reality reveals that to
<br>
which meditation directs us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finitude is finitude.
</em><br>
<p>...and eternal recurrence is eternal recurrence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the real character of transhumanism is just to theorize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans are possible, then it is not in itself a very interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement. It is the application of this theory to improve human life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set practical agendas and guide further research that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism better than (say) theorizing that angels exist.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and if the real character of anti-transhumanism is just to theorize that
<br>
transhumans are impossible, then it is even less interesting, and if
<br>
anti-transhumanism opposes eternal recurrence (and I think it does), then it
<br>
is wrong on both counts. The improvement of human life, setting practical
<br>
goals, and conducting research that promotes health and prosperity makes any
<br>
program or movement better than mere theorizing, and this includes
<br>
(indidentally) transhumanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transhumanism makes sense regardless of whether eternal return occurs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not.
</em><br>
<p>Right, and eternal recurrence happens regardless of whether transhumanism
<br>
makes sense or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, note that if recurrence occurs and transhumanity is possible it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still not correct to deduce that transhumanity must have emerged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere sometime. It might be just an unrealized possiblity, cycle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after cycle.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so, because given infinite time and space, everything that is
<br>
possible eventually and inevitably happens, otherwise (by definition) it can't
<br>
be a possibility. IOW, unrealized possibilities must eventually become real,
<br>
or they are not possibilities to begin with.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
