<p>Right. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. One just has 
<br>
to shift perspective to where we are now, as opposed to where we'd like to be. I'd love to 
<br>
be able to build anything I pleased out of nanobots in an hour, I even have a vague idea 
<br>
of how it works. But the specifics are vague enough that it really would seem like magic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In that case, God is synonymous with most of human endeavour. Maybe that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true, but the term becomes useless, and is problematic because of it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;connotational loading.
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly what I'm saying. But this is only my own, personal god. Anyone else is free 
<br>
to have their own - whether it be some omnipotent and omniscient force that created 
<br>
everything or nothing more than dog backwards is up to them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, it isn't, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, &quot;the posthuman&quot; isn't... it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is merely speculation. One day there may be posthumans, and then they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be us, so hardly greater than us. Secondly, by the time we can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posthumans, we will understand the technology, or will come to as we become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posthuman. That surely would be an amazing journey of discovery, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't involve magic or gods of any kind. Just good 'ole us. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Please don't deify or mystify the concepts of transhumanism; they cease to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make any real sense in such a context. The human that recreates itself into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something new, using only the power of its wits, the material around it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the insights of its dead ancestors, is an incredible vision. Visit a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;library, jump on the net, walk down a crowded city street and experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what we do. Hold something plastic in your hand. Then tell me why we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to worship a god.
</em><br>
<p>All of this makes sense in the context of my above statement. And I never said anything 
<br>
about worshipping gods. Like I said earlier - gods are something to be aspired to, not 
<br>
worshipped. Never worship. Respect that something is bigger or more powerful than you 
<br>
(which, in the end, comes down to fear), respect when a reason for respect is given, but 
<br>
never worship.
