<br>
<p>Alaska is a good example of parasitizing government on the exploitation
<br>
of resources. Most all of the state budget comes from oil revinues,
<br>
which obviously, since the consumers are not state residents, gives the
<br>
government a rather free hand in providing any services it's citizens
<br>
want, since they don't actually pay for it themselves. Its a
<br>
prescription for bloat. The fact that every resident is on welfare as
<br>
well (each state resident receives about $2000 annually from oil
<br>
royalties) doesn't help things.
<br>
<p>Now, Alaska does have the largest percent of land owned by the state and
<br>
federal governments of all states in the union, so that requires a
<br>
rather significant bureaucracy to manage all that land, while, because
<br>
of the degree to which things are spread out, the costs of roads and
<br>
services are similarly much higher. If there were more people in Alaska,
<br>
with less land in government hands, the size of government would be much
<br>
smaller.
