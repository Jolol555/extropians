Okay, the power of positive thinking and all that. However. as &quot;materialists&quot; 
<br>
(in the 19th century sense of the word), we are not limited by our 
<br>
aspirations, but by perseverence, luck and genetics.  So I may have the 
<br>
confidence to become an astrophysicist, but if my neurons are not close 
<br>
enough together ( as some neuro studies indicate) then I shall be a dummy at 
<br>
math, halting my vain attempt to become an astrophysicist..  That is an 
<br>
accident of genetics for which I have no control over, no matter how much 
<br>
remdial math I take ;-)
<br>
<p>My personal invicitus (the poem), is to intellectually explore and advocate 
<br>
thangs like the omega point as well as any other (perhaps more estute) 
<br>
methods of defeating or making use of the abyss.
<br>
<p>&quot;The abyss looked within me, screammed, and ran away!&quot; ~Goethe smarter 
<br>
brother, Roland.
<br>
<p>Dr. Graps conclued:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;By my definition of 'save', I mean *fully responsible for yourself*:
<br>
<p>i.e. for your own happiness, for your own life, for your own path,
<br>
for your own freedom, for your own love, for your own ethics,
<br>
for your own ..., and the list goes on.
<br>
<p>No one can give you answers for who you are now, who you want to be
<br>
in the future, how to be true to yourself, but yourself, in other words.
<br>
