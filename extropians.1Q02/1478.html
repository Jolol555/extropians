<p>Actually, the problem with addiction to smoking is that the &quot;high&quot;
<br>
appears so quickly when you light a cigarette. This creates a very
<br>
short lag between action and reward, and that is why smoking is so
<br>
addictive (similar with intravenously injected drugs). Taking a gum
<br>
or dermal patch will create a far slower buildup of nicotine, and
<br>
this will not have the same reinforcing effect while allowing you to
<br>
avoid withdrawal symptoms. 
<br>
<p>The patches and gum seem to work, although they *help*, they do not

do the job for you:

<p>Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation (Cochrane Review).
<br>
<p>Silagy C, Lancaster T, Stead L, Mant D, Fowler G.
<br>
<p>BACKGROUND: The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to
<br>
replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms
<br>
associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to
<br>
smoke cigarettes. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to
<br>
determine the effectiveness of the different forms of nicotine
<br>
replacement therapy (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray,
<br>
inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a
<br>
sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect
<br>
is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is
<br>
recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the
<br>
intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to
<br>
determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one
<br>
type alone; and to determine its effectiveness compared to other
<br>
pharmacotherapies. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco
<br>
Addiction Group trials register in April 2001. SELECTION CRITERIA:
<br>
Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or no
<br>
treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded
<br>
trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up
<br>
of less than six months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted
<br>
data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and duration and
<br>
form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of
<br>
randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome
<br>
measures was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of
<br>
follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for
<br>
each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where
<br>
appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model
<br>
(Peto). MAIN RESULTS: We identified 108 trials; 94 with a non NRT
<br>
control group. The odds ratio for abstinence with NRT compared to
<br>
control was 1.73 (95% confidence interval 1.62-1.85), The odds ratios
<br>
for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 for gum, 1.76 for patches,
<br>
2.27 for nasal spray, 2.08 for inhaled nicotine and 1.73 for nicotine
<br>
sublingual tablet. These odds were largely independent of the
<br>
duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or
<br>
the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers
<br>
there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2mg gum
<br>
(odds ratio 2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.69 to 4.22). There was
<br>
weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective.
<br>
Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit
<br>
rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another
<br>
pharmacotherapy, in which bupropion was significantly more effective
<br>
than nicotine patch or placebo. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: All of the
<br>
commercially available forms of NRT (nicotine gum, transdermal patch,
<br>
the nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler and nicotine sublingual
<br>
tablets) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking
<br>
cessation. They increase quit rates approximately 1.5 to 2 fold
<br>
regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely
<br>
independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the
<br>
smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although
<br>
beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not
<br>
essential to the success of NRT. There is promising evidence that
<br>
bupropion may be more effective than NRT (either alone or in
<br>
combination). However, its most appropriate place in the therapeutic
<br>
armamentarium requires further study and consideration.
