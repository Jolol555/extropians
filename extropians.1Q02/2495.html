<em>&gt; People have been claiming that you can just draw a line in the sand...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, that seems to be a house of cards. The problem is that you
</em><br>

<p><p>Well, it is a sort of bootstrap problem.  You define the best 
<br>
goal-structure you can from where you are if you are to keep 
<br>
moving and simply not lay down and die or merely survive. 
<br>
Hopefully that goalset includes enough growth, experience, 
<br>
self-examination and (for extropians especially) expansion of 
<br>
abilities and working intelligence that you can later on 
<br>
re-analyse your drivers, motivations, goals and where they come 
<br>
from and create a more refined set.  Of course there are no 
<br>
guarantees up front that the process doesn't break down sooner 
<br>
or later.  There never are in any process that may be referred 
<br>
to as life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; People dismiss this question in general, I think, because it is very very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard, upsetting to contemplate, and has no real impact on day-to-day life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or so they like to delude themselves).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It has tremendous impact actually.  Or it does for me.
