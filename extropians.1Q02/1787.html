<p>Concern with Reputation Helps Motivate Fair Play
<br>
By Melissa Schorr
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A concern with one's reputation can help counter 
<br>
humanity's inherently selfish instincts, according to research published in 
<br>
the latest issue of the journal Nature.
<br>
<p>``There are a lot of interactions where reputation is very important for the 
<br>
decision finding of an individual,'' study co-author Dirk Semmann, a 
<br>
biologist in the department of evolutionary ecology at the Max Planck 
<br>
Institute of Limnology in Plon, Germany, told Reuters Health.
<br>
<p>Lead author Manfred Milinksi and colleagues were concerned with mechanisms 
<br>
that encourage people to cooperate with one another when natural instincts 
<br>
often place self-interest over group interest.
<br>
<p>In one well-known experiment of cooperation, players are put into a group 
<br>
where they can benefit greatly by collectively contributing money to a common 
<br>
pot, but have an incentive to opt out for a greater personal gain. 
<br>
Researchers typically find that without checks or rewards to keep 
<br>
self-interest in line, the tendency to cooperate with others steadily 
<br>
declines.
<br>
<p>In this study, researchers had students play two monetary games, the public 
<br>
goods game in which they publicly donated to the common pot, and a second 
<br>
game called indirect reciprocity, in which players publicly donated money to 
<br>
other people in the group, but never received direct donations back from 
<br>
those particular people.
<br>
<p>As expected, when the players simply played the common goods game, 
<br>
cooperation within the group steadily declined. However, when the players 
<br>
alternated between the two games, their levels of cooperation remained high, 
<br>
motivated by their reputation developed in the public goods game.
<br>
<p>The researchers hypothesize this was because players who were ``stingy'' in 
<br>
the public goods game developed a negative reputation and were ``punished'' 
<br>
by their fellow players in the subsequent indirect reciprocity games. These 
<br>
players were then more motivated to cooperate when they returned to the 
<br>
public goods game.
<br>
<p>The investigators found that the impetus to cooperate was fragile: when the 
<br>
players did not expect to continue the indirect reciprocity game, their 
<br>
cooperation in the public goods game lapsed.
<br>
<p>Overall, though, the players who alternated games had high levels of 
<br>
cooperation in the public goods game--leading to higher profits for all the 
<br>
players involved.
<br>
<p>``Cooperation in the public goods game paid off,'' the authors note. ``Groups 
<br>
that alternated rounds...and thus were more cooperative in the public goods 
<br>
game earned significantly more money.''
<br>
<p>``This result will not change human society,'' noted Semmann. ''But it may 
<br>
help understanding why under certain conditions people will not cooperate.''
