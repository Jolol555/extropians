<p><em>&gt;Is it just me, or is this guy writing to impress people with his

</em><br>
<p>Not so fast. If you haven't even bothered trying to find out what his
<br>
technical terminology means, why jump to the smug know-nothing conclusion
<br>
that it must be `oblique' (or wanky, or pretentious, or la-de-dah, or
<br>
pointy-headed, or any other convenient term to cover your insecurity by
<br>
projecting the fault on to him)? 
<br>
<p>Scientists and programmers communicate in a swarm of specialized jargon,
<br>
and so do surveyors and cardiac surgeons and trial lawyers and kindergarten
<br>
teachers for all I know. That's because specialized terminology is
<br>
*compressed*; it's shorthand, it can carry enormous sidebars of filiation
<br>
(exactly one of those terms: I mean the elaborate cultural background and
<br>
prior discussion it implies or connotes) that allow a painstaking or expert
<br>
domain reader to take in a vast amount of implied information, on a lot of
<br>
levels simultaneously, all in one hit. That's also what poetry does, too,
<br>
when it's working. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If I understood those words that aren't in my dictionary, I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rewrite what he wrote in two sentences that a child could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand.
</em><br>
<p>Probably not. A complex conversation has been going on since the 1960s at
<br>
least, within which terms of art like eschaton and techné play a part like
<br>
`state reduction' in quantum theory or `gerund' in grammar or `sulcus' in
<br>
neuroanatomy. You could spell out some of these associations in less
<br>
specialized words, of course, but you'll be hard pressed to do it in two
<br>
paragraphs or two pages, let alone two sentences.
<br>
<p>The final comment about trying to `seem &quot;intellectual&quot;' is unworthy of this
<br>
list, unless you think `intellectual' is a term of abuse (`Ya ya, he's
<br>
reading, ya ya, he's *thinking*, let's pelt the creep with stones and tear
<br>
up his book!') or, more likely, you are claiming that he must be just
<br>
*feigning* his intellectual culture. That would be a more compelling
<br>
argument if you'd taken the trouble to find out what he was saying, and
<br>
countering it with a reasoned retort.
