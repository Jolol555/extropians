<p>
Just saw an article in todays paper by a Baltimore Sun reporter (the
<br>
article doesn't seem to appear on the Sun's own website, odd that) about
<br>
the cloning of a prize winning holstein cow named Zita and her many
<br>
clone sisters at a Williamsport, MD farm called, of all things,
<br>
&quot;Futuraland 2020&quot;. A positive article on the story of the farmer and his
<br>
cow breeding career (he earns more money from breeding and selling
<br>
genetic material than from milk) and how he jumped into cloning when his
<br>
prize winning cow, Zita (who produced over 40k gallons in one year)
<br>
reached retirement age and eventually stopped producing eggs.
<br>
<p>The reporter, Patricia Meisol, should be commended for her unbiased
<br>
reporting of the story, with no boogeyman fear mongering as is so
<br>
typical these days. She should be put on top of Pro-Act's list of people
<br>
to send press releases to.
<br>
<p>Perhaps, also, the DC area extropians might have a field trip to the
<br>
Futuraland Farm, which is open to visitors and has an exhibit on Zita,
<br>
her parentage and offspring, including the cloning technology. The
<br>
farmer, Greg Wiles, is obviously someone who is a natural transhumanist.
