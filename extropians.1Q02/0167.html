<p>
I should also have drawn attanetion to the many responses linked from the
<br>
end of that article. I liked this one:
<br>
<p>===============
<br>
<p>A second, cross-over trial can be performed in which the control group
<br>
becomes the experimental group and is prayed for. Should the results of the
<br>
second trial demonstrate that the new experimental group have
<br>
retrospectively improved outcomes then that really would be a breakthrough
<br>
in the study of the existence of the non-material world. Thus God would
<br>
have been shown to exist and one could return to a comforting Universe
<br>
where a paternal, loving anthropomorphic being gives us protection from
<br>
reality. And fairies would take up residence at the bottom of my garden. 
<br>
<p>=================
<br>
<p>and this one:
<br>
<p>=================
<br>
<p>As any student of Star Trek will tell you, the first rule of time travel is
<br>
that you cannot change the course of history, otherwise you get into an
<br>
infinite regress. 
<br>
&nbsp;In the case of Leibovici's study, if we accept that people can be made
<br>
better by future prayer or other intervention then must have been made
<br>
better at the first time of that intervention, when they were ill. 
<br>
&nbsp;In which case it would then be impossible for them to be subsequently
<br>
allocated to the placebo arm of the study. 
<br>
&nbsp;That means this paper is not a randomised controlled trial. 
<br>
&nbsp;But then you knew that already ! 
<br>
<p>=====================
<br>
<p>but perhaps the real crunch is this:
<br>
<p>=====================
<br>
<p>It was very brave of both the author and the BMJ to publish this paper in a
<br>
scientific journal and be prepared for the inevitable criticism from the
<br>
outraged masses. The idea that retroactive intercessory prayers could have
<br>
an influence on the outcome of septicaemia is intriguing and challenges our
<br>
notions of cause and effect.However, if it is true, this is not the paper
<br>
to prove it. The data on the the most significant finding,length of stay,
<br>
appears to be skewed by a few abnormally high results in the control
<br>
group.This is demonstrated by the fact that the median length of stay is
<br>
the same in both groups but the maximum length of stay in the control group
<br>
is twice that in the intervention group. This may represent a type I
<br>
statistical error,despite the large sample size. From a cynical stand
<br>
point, it is a shame that God cannot save your life but might get you out
<br>
of hospital a few days earlier.Either way, it was a thought provoking paper
<br>
but may just prove the power of statistics, not of prayer.
