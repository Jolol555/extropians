</em><br>
<p><p>They human brain doesn't have to operate like modern silicon, only be

mappable to it.  There are some basic mathematical criteria for what can and
<br>
can't be mapped to silicon, and the brain definitely looks like it can be
<br>
mapped.  It is utterly irrelevant if it uses very different hardware because
<br>
the results are all that matter.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Input and output results are all you need to duplicate ANY finite state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; machinery.  Universal FSM copying algorithms create structures that look very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; similar to neural networks, not like the more conventional algorithms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; most people who work with software are familiar with.  With &quot;weight states&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about hidden units????????
</em><br>
<p><p>Hidden units are again irrelevant.  If they don't modify the input at the
<br>
output, then they are computationally null.  If they ARE modifying the
<br>
output, then they will be modeled automatically just like everything else.
<br>
What is the value of a hidden unit if it has no measurable impact on the
<br>
process?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; All serial computers can do is model or simulate mpd function ... the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lock-step mechanism cannot be replicated exactly in serial because in parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all nodes are updated AT ONCE, this is why it is called parallel, whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lock-step simulation in serial just does one process at a time, linearly. And,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, what about hidden units?????
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There are an infinite number of algorithms that can implement any process.
<br>
Inputs mapping identically to outputs is the definition of an equivalent
<br>
algorithmic form.  Hardware and software architecture are irrelevant.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, modelling a parallel process done serially checkpoints at the
<br>
same exact state as the truly parallel model.  The only difference between
<br>
parallel and serial in this case is that the state transitional steps are
<br>
computed differently.  Therefore, the results are computationally
<br>
indistinguishable.  It may go against whatever intuition you have, but if
<br>
you actually study the problem you'll find that parallel and serial
<br>
computation are computationally equivalent and interchangeable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Not only just very different, but nothing like! You can't go the other way and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extract the &quot;algorithm&quot; being used by brains because the brain changes its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiring, not just weight states. Also, how can u reproduce graceful degradation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in serial? If the bit stream is disrupted u r f**c**d!
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, the computational process is irrelevant.  Equality of outcome
<br>
demonstrates equivalence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; All you can get from improved serial is more speed ... but speed of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; z80 is slower by a magnitude than a P4, but is not a jot more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentient!
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>While I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, can you prove that your P4
<br>
isn't more sentient than your Z80?  What is your criteria?
<br>
<p>Silicon is just the computational machinery; the software is way more
<br>
important.  The human brain is what would be considered software implemented
<br>
in hardware.  It doesn't have to be that way but nature apparently has
<br>
difficulty evolving proper von neumann machines.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I await your (or anyone's) manifesation of a finite-state sentient computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with baited breath (yawn), but meantime will carry on with my own work.
</em><br>
<p><p>Good for you.  As Eugene would say, nothing beats a killer demo.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way, I don't think that standard neural nets as they exist now are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient for sentience either, though are a necessary part (they are from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work on reverse engineering of the brain after all).
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not a big fan of neural networks.  They are inefficient approximations
<br>
of generalized forms as apparently implemented in the brain.  Worse yet, our
<br>
software implementations are bad approximations of the wetware.
<br>
