</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other end are countless naked people.  That would be fine,

<em>&gt; The local Baptists tried to make nakedness illegal at the beach.  Several
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Would you rather have us here, or out at the beach?&quot;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; The Baptists dropped their case.
