<em>&gt; &gt; In the current environment positioning yourself to be sheltered from the

</em><br>
<p>Dear Jame Rogers,
<br>
<p>I have found most of your posts to be most delighful reading and usually very well informed. I take exception to this particular
<br>
piece in its entirety.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no necessity that fiat currencies implode.
</em><br>
<p>All fiat-currencies return to their intrinsic value- zero. There are no exceptions in the experimental record. Current experiments
<br>
are progressing in much the same manner as prior runs, albeit with novel and rococo leveraged permutations- OTC interest swaps, gold
<br>
swaps, metal leasing, claims on SDR certs on top of SDRs on top of gold certs on top of ?, etc. See Doug Noland's column at
<br>
www.prudentbear.com, e.g. &quot;Financial Arbitrage Capitalism&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Mismanagement HAS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused a large number of fiat currencies to crash, but it isn't an intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of fiat currencies
</em><br>
<p>A currency 'crash' or 'collapse' or (price)-hyperinflation is an emergent property of unbacked claims on assets. The crash is driven
<br>
by the same deterioration of credit quality and loss of investor confidence that heralds a stock or bond crash. The diminished
<br>
demand for cash balances (e.g. the meme &quot;cash is trash&quot;) characterizes hyperinflation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and there are a few currencies around the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have long histories of being relatively well-managed.
</em><br>
<p>This is a startling juxaposition of words. One might as well declare a child-sex ring, a counterfeiting racket, or a pyramid scheme
<br>
&quot;well managed&quot;. The longest lived fiat curency in history is the so-called US Dollar (yet another Statist  lie, btw), which has
<br>
inflated by 1000% (i.e. has lost 90% of its purchasing power) during my lifetime. There is *no way* to prevent the total destruction
<br>
of an unbacked currency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this light,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it may be better to evaluate currencies like you would evaluate so-called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value stocks, by looking at their management history and guessing whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not that historical management trend will continue.
</em><br>
<p>Looking in the rear-view mirror at a few red and blue lines is not the same as studying economics and the intertwining of monetary
<br>
and geopolitical history. For example, the history of the Federal Reserve and the the history of global warfare are one and the
<br>
same. If war is the health of the Sate, inflation is the bulwark of militarism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As a separate issue, gold is not generally a good investment (nor are most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mined commodities these days).  Ignoring fluctuations caused by political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns and a weakening perception of its &quot;intrinsic value&quot;, there is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem of it being not nearly as rare as it used to be.
</em><br>
<p>There appear to be about 120,000- 140,000 MT of gold *aboveground*, though these figures are disputed. Something less than 20 grams
<br>
for each human alive. Gold is as rare as ever, though gold-denominated instruments (paper gold) may have reached an historical high,
<br>
similar to the situation in the late 1960's, and in the early 1930's. This inflation (issuance of multiple claims per available gold
<br>
atom) is responsible for the current low price of the metal. See for example the GATA derivatives report- www.gata.org and various
<br>
articles at www.usagold.com   www.gold-eagle.com and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuing problem where production capacity has outstripped demand
</em><br>
<p>Production has been running roughtly 2/3rds of demand for at least the past ten years. The other 1/3 has been met through scrap
<br>
recycling, possibly central bank selling/leasing (this is somewhat debatable), other dark and murky means. The gold market is the
<br>
most difficult market of all to track. After spending a few hundred hours rifling through various FRB, BIS, IMF, LBMA, COMEX, etc.,
<br>
etc., reports, I've learned it is also the most sophisticated. Gold is the central force of the financial universe. Nothing changes
<br>
on New Year's Day.
