<br>
Define improvement.  Improving the 'picture' of a rocket engine isn't
<br>
the same as improving the 'picture' of its own place in the grand scheme
<br>
of things.

&nbsp;
<br>
_What_ own ends, or own purposes?
<br>
<p>Here's a vague path to AI.  Take a command shell, one of those DOS or
<br>
Unix programs which literally and obviously wait for typed instructions.
<br>
Give it larger vocabulary, and concepts of things, and a language looping
<br>
between perception and conception so it can parse ambiguous English
<br>
sentences.  Give it intelligence and powers, so it can fulfill more
<br>
complex orders.  Make it aware of what it's doing, so when exploring a
<br>
complex or vague or creative task it can detect ruts (trying the same
<br>
bad attempted solution over and over) and avoid them.  Make it aware
<br>
enough to talk about what it's doing.
<br>
<p>None of this, in my mind, recently enriched by reading PhD theses of
<br>
Hofstadter's students, suggests any pressure toward independence and
<br>
autonomy or having 'own ends'.  All the complexity is geared toward
<br>
fulfilling whatever command it received at the prompt.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, so tell me (1) how will that question be answered? or (2) how will we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent that question from being asked?
</em><br>
<p>Don't need to prevent the question; just need to not cause it.
<br>
Self-awareness isn't some materialist substitute for the soul, carrying
<br>
all the properties we expect from other humans.  It's one mechanism to
<br>
slip in.  A desire for autonomy, or independent ends, are other
<br>
mechanisms.
