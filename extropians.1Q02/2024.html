<p>I found that site almost as offensive as the TopText
<br>
that was installed when I downloaded KaZaA.
<br>
<p>This is the web site of a person who is willing to use
<br>
dirty tricks instead of cold hard truth.  The tip is
<br>
his continual warning that &quot;these people will even
<br>
allow your children to see porn!&quot; and his calling
<br>
programs such as TopText &quot;a virus&quot;.  If you have a
<br>
legitimate point, you don't need the emotionally
<br>
loaded words and hyperbole to make it.
<br>
<p>And it didn't actually take you to sites you didn't
<br>
want to go to (as he continually claimed but failed to
<br>
actually demonstrate).  It DID give you choices in
<br>
addition to (not instead of) what the designer of the
<br>
site gave you.  Ones the designer didn't intend.  It
<br>
wasn't &quot;link hijacking&quot;... no links were redirected,
<br>
just new ones created and additional choices added to
<br>
existing links.
<br>
<p>Once I saw what TopText was, I didn't want it and I
<br>
had no problem at all uninstalling it.   
<br>
<p>And THAT is how it should be... if a program isn't
<br>
useful to me, I simply don't use it.  TopText and
<br>
other similar programs do not add any functionality
<br>
that I want.  I do NOT, however, think that it is an
<br>
inherently unethical program... just a useless one. 
<br>
<p>If someone came up with a program that added useful
<br>
links to web pages or useful content not originally
<br>
intended by the site owner I'd use it.  It's my PC,
<br>
not their's and as long as I don't resell their
<br>
content I can do whatever I want with it.
