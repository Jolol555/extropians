</em><br>
<p>But at what cost, Harvey? Because medical care costs money, every dollar
<br>
spent is x.xx hours of someone's life spent laboring for themselves or
<br>
for the government. Why slave away x hours of your life when you are
<br>
only going to get a fraction of that back in increased life span?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The fact is that the vast majority of people insufficiently invest for
<br>
their retirement, primarily because they fail to properly estimate what
<br>
their health care costs will be in old age. They ignore the fact that
<br>
80-90% of lifetime health care expenses occur in the last few years of
<br>
life, as Robin has pointed out.
<br>
<p>Increased life span from health care is only cost effective when the
<br>
cost of every hour of additional life is less than the average amortized
<br>
hourly wage of the individual. Only then is health care actually having
<br>
a positive impact on society. You are doing good in the world. When the
<br>
incremental cost is higher than the average hourly wage, you are
<br>
damaging society and enslaving people's lives to no beneficial purpose.
<br>
This is called evil.
