<p><em>&gt; Again I want to remind you that Robin Hanson, who as an economist who

</em><br>
<p>Hal, do you know if Robin studied things like clean water, sanitation
<br>
or refrigeration?  Or perhaps the spread of &quot;sterile&quot; medical practices
<br>
(physicians washing hands in the mid-late 1800's, sterile operating rooms,
<br>
etc.).  Or perhaps it is simply a rising standard of living and better nutrition.
<br>
<p>There is a *big* difference in lifespan extensions when you are
<br>
pushing it out to the maximum genetic potential (70-90 on average
<br>
perhaps) and trying to push it beyond the maximum potential.
<br>
Due to the exponential growth in disease conditions later in
<br>
life, frequent checkups become increasingly important as you
<br>
get older to catch developing conditions before they become
<br>
life-threatening conditions.  There are many conditions
<br>
associated with wear and tear, diabetes and high blood
<br>
pressure are two that come to mind, where your longevity
<br>
will be determined by the integrated area under the curve
<br>
(severity of condition x length of time untreated or treated
<br>
poorly) that will determine how successful one will be a
<br>
retaining a &quot;healthy&quot; condition.
<br>
<p>So while Robin's conclusions may be valid for the previous
<br>
century when one was pushing life expectancy from ~50 to ~75,
<br>
that doesn't mean that ignoring &quot;healthy prescriptions&quot; for
<br>
disease prevention and early detection is a good idea today.
