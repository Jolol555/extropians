<em>&gt; I am curious as to any other armies of the world that are fully integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along the lines of Starship Troopers.  As a former military officer I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not aware of any.  It &quot;seems to work out MUCH better...&quot;?  If there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any and they do work MUCH better, I'd love to know about it.
</em><br>
<p><p>Part of the problem with gender equality in the military is that in practice
<br>
politics screws it up shortly after it has been implemented.  For example,
<br>
when the Canadian military officially integrated back in 1989, it took a
<br>
whopping seven years before politics became injected into it.  In Canada's
<br>
case, they discovered that only a miniscule fraction of the women could meet
<br>
the standards to be in combat arms units.  Furthermore, retention of women
<br>
in these units was terrible, due mostly to the filthy labor intensive
<br>
environment.  The Canadian solution circa 1996:  establish quotas and lower
<br>
standards until you can meet the quotas.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I once was involved in a joint exercise for a week with a
<br>
Canadian assault engineer unit that had some women in it during this
<br>
1989-1996 period of honest gender equality.  The women in those units at
<br>
that time were pretty hardcore and pulled their own weight.  (Contrary to
<br>
expectations, those women were prettier girls than the average US Army woman
<br>
by a good margin, a fact that many guys will probably find interesting.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'd also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to know their demonstrated combat effectiveness or reputation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success on the battlefield.  Because the fundamental issue here is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether women can fight.  They certainly can and do.  The issue is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well a fully integrated infantry or combat-arms unit would fight, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit, over a period of time.
</em><br>
<p><p>I would add that in my own experience, women do not function as well
<br>
cognitively in a strenuous combat environment particularly of the small unit
<br>
infantry type.  The difference is pretty obvious on observation.  During
<br>
times of sensory overload (e.g. a firefight involving a fair number of
<br>
participants), male soldiers tend to automatically partition the threat
<br>
almost systematically, having a good situational awareness of the
<br>
battlefield but their minds only focusing on individual targets.  This
<br>
cognitive behavior is an automatic response to threats of this nature.
<br>
Female soldiers on the other hand, seem to take the whole situation in at
<br>
once without having the ability to really partition the threat into
<br>
bite-size chunks.  I've observed this many, many times.  If the number of
<br>
things to keep track of is too high, women become ineffective, whereas men
<br>
seem to have the innate ability to prioritize threats and focus on
<br>
individual targets.  My suspicion is that this is probably due in no small
<br>
part to men having substantially better spatial processing capabilities than
<br>
women, being able to track multiple vectors on the battlefield with relative
<br>
ease.  
<br>
<p>I think a fully integrated military is possible, but that only a tiny
<br>
fraction of the population would be well-suited for that type of
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
