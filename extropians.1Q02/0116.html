<em>&gt; &gt; resources remains the same--the amount of solar energy the planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can harness.  It's only the efficiency with which we can use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not so.  The effective amount of wealth does not remain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same. 
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say that, and I never would.  Please don't misquote me.
<br>
I understand the difference between natural resources and &quot;wealth&quot;.
<br>
But my statement stands: the former /is/ finite and limited.
<br>
<p>Our disagreement, if there is one, is that I believe that this
<br>
limitation will become a /more/ significant factor limiting
<br>
wealth as we advance, and you seem to contend that it will
<br>
become less of a factor, and that more of our wealth will be
<br>
informational and such.  Your scenario is quite possible, and
<br>
I won't discount it out of hand, but I can't share it. No matter
<br>
how much wealth we create over and above natural resources,
<br>
someone with more natural resources can still create more than
<br>
someone with less.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That it is not literally infinite is rather beside the point. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is certainly not be any stretch &quot;scarcity&quot; of the kind our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic system was designed to cope with unless we create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial scarcity by insisting the commons stays artificially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small and everything imaginable has a price tag slapped on it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have actually heard some go so far as to claim that every atom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of matter and erg of energy must be owned by someone.  
</em><br>
<p>Yep, I'm one of those.  Owned things get put to effective use;
<br>
things in the commons are inevitably destroyed and neglected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Just because it's harder for humans to visualize the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between 1 and 2 billion than to visualize the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1 and 2 hundred doesn't mean the difference doesn't exist.  As I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; said before, when everyone on the planet is a billionaire, the guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with 10 billion still gets the girl, the bigger spaceship, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; asteroid in the better neighborhood, and the nicer toys.  &quot;Scarcity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a relative thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would hope that we grow out of this kind of adolescent rivalry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly soon.  But I won't hold my breath.
</em><br>
<p>Competition is life. There is no higher purpose, or nobler pursuit.
<br>
It is only when competition deteriorates into predation and violence
<br>
that there is a problem, and I would certainly hope that we grow
<br>
out of /that/.  But as for competition in general, if there weren't
<br>
such a thing, I can't imagine wanting to live.
