Not to mention copyright enforcement.  Intellectual property rights are

always struck me as utterly bizarre.  It's possible Gates would have

done well in an anarchy; it's also possible his particular business

skills would have been useless in that environment.  Or that he never
<br>
got the chance to try.  All we can say is that the first-order effect on
<br>
Microsoft of removing all government would be _horrible_.  Ask him if he
<br>
wants to live with totally legal software piracy.

So Bill Gates and Harvey and Brent are tax criminals?  They did become
<br>
wealthy, after all.
