<p>
I would generally agree with Daniel that use of any machines that
<br>
produce ionizing radiation is not to be take lightly.  One might
<br>
&quot;mitigate&quot; these effects (perhaps by consuming high levels of Vitamin E
<br>
for a couple of weeks before the examination).  Any approaches to
<br>
probes that do not produce ionizing radiation (NMR, ultrasound, etc.)
<br>
are highly preferable to X-rays.
<br>
<p>However to be very &quot;balanced&quot; about it one would have to do a
<br>
comparison of the relative risks of the various things to
<br>
which one is exposed.  I always found the Ames statistics
<br>
with regard to average weighted exposure to various carcinogens
<br>
rather educational.  By far, for the average individual, alcohol
<br>
is way out in front (except for tobacco consumers).  After one
<br>
has minimized that (if one so chooses) I think the next thing
<br>
one needs to do is to test ones environment for radon levels.
<br>
<p>Finally one needs to balance the benefit any diagnostic information
<br>
might provide with technology trends.  If exposure to ionizing
<br>
radiation produces a cancer or accelerates aging one has to
<br>
balance that against diagnostic information that might result
<br>
with regard to pre-existing conditions.  Our ability to deal
<br>
with the ill-effects of current tests will be significantly
<br>
increased in the future.  So tests which significantly serve
<br>
to promote one surviving to that future time (without having
<br>
to be suspended) are perhaps justifiable even if they would
<br>
be considered undesirable in a perfect world.
<br>
