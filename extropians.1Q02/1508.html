<em>&gt;From: &quot;Dickey, Michael F&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com?Subject=Re:%20Addiction">michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Do the genes that create a propensity for alchoholism also enable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your brain, subconcioussly of course, to A) recognize an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alchoholic beverage B)reach a hand out and grasp it C) bring it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward your mouth D)swallow it? Or, at some point in time, are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concioussly aware of these things going on.  Even being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alchoholic, even being born with the genetic predisposition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alchoholism (which is more a genetic predisposition to addictive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior) you can still CHOOSE to not drink, its as simple as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that.  Can a person with MS CHOOSE not to have MS?  I dont think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so.  
</em><br>
<p>Alcoholism is not a genetic predisposition to addictive behavior,
<br>
it is a genetic predisposition to a substance. Once addicted to a
<br>
substance it is not easy to quit, but I agree it is essential.
<br>
<p>Both alcoholism and MS are genetic in basis. You cannot become an
<br>
alcoholic without the requisite genetics.
<br>
<p>Some people cannot touch alcohol without getting ill, an alcoholic
<br>
can drink sufficient quantities to kill themselves without getting
<br>
ill.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Thats great, fascinating and interesting, and would apply if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were rats. But we are not, we are people, people who are aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thier actions and thier choices, people who have free will.  Rats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when in stressed confined situations can resort to cannibalism. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does that mean people will too? Primates exhibit what is known as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 'Elevator effect' when in stressed confined conditions.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are all calm and polite to one another, which, surprisingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough, is how human's behave as well.  Just cause a Rat does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something, does not mean a person will.  
</em><br>
<p>Alcoholism is not simply about behavior, and the biochemical
<br>
pathways first established in rat studies have been confirmed in
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There is also considerable evidence that if someone, no matter how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addicted to something, chooses to stop doing it, he (or she) can. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That evidence being the multitude of people who have stopped doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something they are addicted to doing by just deciding that they no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer want to do it.  We can, after all 'decide' to stop eating. 
</em><br>
<p>This is incorrect.
<br>
<p>Any medical professional can tell you drug addicts (including
<br>
alcohol) can and do die going cold turkey.
<br>
<p>The issue is considerably more complex.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;IMHO that is...
</em><br>
<p>I'm dealing in facts, not opinions.
