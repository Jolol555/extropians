<em>&gt;From: &quot;Tom Cowper&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tcowper@capital.net?Subject=Re:%20The%20Intergrated%20Military%20(was%20Re:%20Transgender%20Marriage)">tcowper@capital.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I am curious as to any other armies of the world that are fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;integrated along the lines of Starship Troopers.  As a former
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military officer I'm  not aware of any.  It &quot;seems to work out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MUCH better...&quot;?  If there are any and they do work MUCH better,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd love to know about it.  I'd also like to know their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrated combat effectiveness or reputation for success on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;battlefield.  Because the fundamental issue here is not whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;women can fight.  They certainly can and do.  The issue is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well a fully integrated infantry or combat-arms unit would fight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a unit, over a period of time.  Sexual tension injected into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;otherwise highly emotional situation under dire and strenuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstances that put young men and young women together in very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;close and sometimes intimate relationships would seem to me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a significant impact on combat effectiveness. No? As far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm aware it's the main reason that it hasn't been adopted in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US, political rhetoric aside.  It's more than cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indoctrination, and it's not something that will simply go away as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society or people get used to it.  Combat effectiveness is hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough to attain  and maintain without the turmoil of the sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factor on the frontlines. And it will be a long time before we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condition men and women to simply ignore or suppress at will our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionary sexual impulses enough to where they don't negatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impact unit fighting capability, transhumanism notwithstanding. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IMO.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the interesting post.
<br>
<p>There are many situations where men and women working together
<br>
learn to deal effectively with &quot;sexual tension&quot; and I see no reason
<br>
why the military should be any different.
<br>
<p>The military has it's own double standards about sex (male officers
<br>
may date female enlisteds but not vice versa) and is highly
<br>
resistant to change.
<br>
<p>But the fact is many (including myself) see it as morally wrong to
<br>
exclude homosexuals from service to their country. As a former
<br>
Marine (1975-1979) I know I wasn't too fond of the concept when I
<br>
served, but I was also young and had a lot to learn. I learned to
<br>
deal with it at the YMCA and I'm sure others could. Those who can't
<br>
or won't, should be the ones excluded.
<br>
<p>The only fair solution I've seen was a fully integrated unit as
<br>
portrayed in &quot;Starship Troopers.&quot; &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was the book
<br>
that convinced me to join the USMC and I was delighted to learn
<br>
it's now on the boot camp recommended reading list.
<br>
<p>Change can be difficult, and so is progress, but essential.
