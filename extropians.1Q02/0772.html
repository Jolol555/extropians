<p>
My transhumanist lawyer-philosopher pal Russell Blackford, currently
<br>
unsubbed due to pressure of work and study, allowed me to fwd these useful
<br>
comments on Hal's interesting post:
<br>
<p>=============
<br>
<p>Hal's post strikes me as deeply confused.
<br>
<p>For a start, traditional libertarians believe in property rights, but these
<br>
are essentially laws excluding people and corporations from doing whatever
<br>
they like with someone else's &quot;property&quot;. Property rights are a social
<br>
compromise that overrides my freedom to do whatever I want with whatever I
<br>
want, whenever I want. They may be a *good idea*, but they are still
<br>
coercive.
<br>
<p>More importantly, he doesn't distinguish between (1) the view that
<br>
libertarian &quot;rights&quot; (I deny that such a thing exists except where positive
<br>
rights are created by some kind of legal or quasi-legal system, but I'll
<br>
accept the word as shorthand) can sometimes be overridden for a good reason
<br>
and (2) the idea that they can always be overridden for any purpose at all.
<br>
He seems to think that because the social democrat is committed to the
<br>
former that this entails a commitment to the latter. At least that's the
<br>
only sense I can make of his post.
<br>
<p>Real live social democrats are likely to think that there are all sorts of
<br>
good economic reasons for overriding liberty (though my suggestion is that
<br>
they are not overriding liberty at all, merely overriding property rights
<br>
which are, if anything, an exception to the presumption of liberty). I don't
<br>
see why the social democrat should not otherwise demand a very high
<br>
threshold before thinking the state is justified in interfering with what
<br>
people believe, say and do - including transforming and enhancing
<br>
themselves. Hence, there is every reason why a social democrat could be a
<br>
good transhumanist.
<br>
<p>=======
<br>
<p>[he added later that he regarded as more important his comment
<br>
about social democrats being able to]
<br>
support a position similar to classical liberalism on non-economic issues,
<br>
rather than my comments on property rights. While I believe the latter, I
<br>
also realise that it (1) raises deep and complex issues in political and
<br>
legal philosophy that will never get resolved on the list and (2) it is a
<br>
red rag to a lot of the extropes. As for the former, it seems to me to be a
<br>
fact that social democrats have a reasonable record of defending individual
<br>
freedom. Maybe the libertarians could have done better but practical
<br>
alternative to date has been the socially conservative (often, but not
<br>
always, religious) right. There is the real enemy of freedom within Western
<br>
society.
