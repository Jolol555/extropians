</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this decade, or ~15 years / decade.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how a gene discovered today could be affecting everyone
<br>
within 10 years.  Will we  perfect a method of genetic insertion into
<br>
all of the relevant cells, get government approval, and administer it
<br>
to the entire Western world within 10 years?  I'm sure we all agree that
<br>
this is impossible.  A better prospect would be to find out what the
<br>
gene does and hope that it is something which can be turned into a pill.
<br>
But even then there is no proof that the pill would accomplish the same
<br>
thing until you have studied it for decades, so there is no way that
<br>
everyone will be swallowing the pill within ten years.
<br>
<p>(BTW I think animal models are of limited use in human longevity studies,
<br>
since people already live something like 3 times what they should compared
<br>
to similar animals, implying that they are already benefiting from some
<br>
biochemical longevity genes which are absent elsewhere.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that proves to be the case, then the expected longevity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone on the list under the age of ~65 just became *much*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater!
</em><br>
<p>Even if somehow everyone had the effects of this gene inside them within
<br>
10 years, that would not necessarily increase longevity to a large degree.
<br>
It is plausible that the effects are spread out over a lifetime, slowing
<br>
aging constantly, so that, say, a 70 year old with the protection is like
<br>
a 60 year old without it.  Hence someone who was already an adult, let
<br>
alone 65 years old, would not get much benefit from adding the effects
<br>
of the gene so late in life.  A 65 year old with a life expectancy of
<br>
15 years might get his expectancy increased to ~18 years.  The effects
<br>
on young people would probably be correspondingly greater.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, the &quot;harsh&quot; reality of this brings up an interesting question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've always thought that there should be a fundamental shift
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in personal economic planning that takes place when people begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to realize they are likely to live hundreds of years.  I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this &quot;The no-brainer strategy to becoming wealthy&quot;.  It requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking $100-$1000 and depositing it in a savings account or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutual fund and never withdrawing any funds from the account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the annual increase in the account value exceeds what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one reasonably needs to live in the world.  It is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea that it doesn't require sophisticated investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategies to become wealthy, it simply requires living long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough.
</em><br>
<p>I see two problems with this investment strategy.  One is that it might
<br>
not work.  Savings accounts can lose value to inflation, and mutual
<br>
funds can lose value to crashes.  Some people will prefer to use their
<br>
judgement and move their money around among investments, depending on
<br>
economic conditions.
<br>
<p>The other is that even if the account value does grow in absolute terms,
<br>
it may not grow relative to our desires.  In other words, as the world
<br>
grows wealthier, although we can get more in the future if we save our
<br>
money today, it may not be as much as we would like.  Over the course
<br>
of my career, which began 23 years ago, my income has grown by a factor
<br>
of 7.  If I had saved $100 back then in a savings account, it would have
<br>
grown, but not by that much.  So in a sense I would have lost money.
<br>
Now granted, I have been moving through the fastest-growing part of
<br>
my career, and this will probably not be sustained over the long term.
<br>
But it makes sense that our perceived needs will grow proportionately
<br>
to the total wealth of society.  Hence any investment which grows more
<br>
slowly than that is actually a net loser.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would seem that Extropians/Transhumanists should be the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to recognize the paradigm shift and adopt this strategy.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see any evidence that any of these individuals that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know have done so.  So the &quot;interesting question&quot; is &quot;Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is this the case?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean that no one has applied this.  Are you saying
<br>
that no one is saving money?  Surely that is wrong.  Are you saying that
<br>
none of the people saving money are putting it into savings accounts
<br>
and/or mutual funds?  I can't believe that either; I for one have money
<br>
in both of those categories.
<br>
<p>Or maybe you're just saying that no one sees this saving in the way you
<br>
do, as &quot;the&quot; strategy for getting rich in the long term?  That might be,
<br>
but I think the reasons are different from what you give.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Possible explanations I can think of are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) We don't really believe lifespan extension of more than 1 yr/yr
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is feasible;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) We believe the NanoSantas will make all wealth creation strategies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    irrelevant;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) We believe the SysOp AI will make all wealth creation strategies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    irrelevant;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; d) We belive the singularity will so totally disrupt things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    all wealth creation strategies are irrelevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are probably some others but I think this may cover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the positions.
</em><br>
<p>I think the right answer is a variation on (a), which is that we think
<br>
it will take quite a while to get to 1 year/year, and may not be within
<br>
our lifetimes.  And even if it does happen before we die and we are
<br>
able to benefit from it, we would still prefer to have more money rather
<br>
than less at that time, and in fact at all times.  Hence we look for the
<br>
best investment opportunities we can find.
<br>
<p>It's possible that some people do believe in (b)-(d), mostly young people
<br>
who have a greater likelihood of seeing these changes before they get
<br>
old.  But I would hope that most Extropians would want a contingency
<br>
plan in case none of the Singularity scenarios pan out.  Generally,
<br>
having more resources will give you more options.
