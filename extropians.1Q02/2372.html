Eugene Leitl  asked me to repost this reply to the list, since he's

<p>You misunderstood me. The current me would of course want to prevent that
<br>
fate (broken statues do look ugly). However, that's the *current* me, and
<br>
future-I of course have very little power on actions of *others*. There's
<br>
clearly rather nasty things relatively to mankind written in game theory
<br>
and evolutionary pressure of postbiological beings. A great motivation to
<br>
not stay behind, and to proceed slowly, and cautiosly, imo.
<br>
<p>eli&gt; For what it's worth, Wayne, if we somehow wind up in a scenario where
<br>
eli&gt; both Eugene and I are around as uploads, and we both have the
<br>

<br>
eli&gt; Earth, then I'll protect you from Eugene.  I can't make any realistic
<br>
<p>Yes, and I will protect you from Eliezer, of course. ;P
<br>
<p>eli&gt; commitment on behalf of a transhuman future self because my goals
<br>
eli&gt; might change, but that's the current output of my goal system.
<br>
<p>Of course.
