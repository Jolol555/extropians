<em>&gt;From: Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20POLITICS:%20H.R.%201542">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;So let me get this straight: the Bell's will only offer high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bandwidth service to their customers if we agree to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ourselves to become prisoners of monopolies again, and if we agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you can't be required to sell bandwidth at below retail rates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to resellers? Yet, the RBOC's will retain the right to buy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sell bandwidth amongst themselves.
</em><br>
<p>We are currently required to sell telephones/bandwidth below COST,
<br>
not retail, and yes, like every other business in America we are
<br>
not going to engage in business that is without profit. Nor are we
<br>
going to continue to subsidize the so-called &quot;competition&quot;. The
<br>
only thing they are competiting for is a share of RBOC generated
<br>
revenue.
<br>
<p>Nobody says there has to be a monopoly, let the PLEC's build their
<br>
own networks.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This is tantamount to the big three car makers getting together
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and saying &quot;We'll only sell cars to you if you agree that you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pick one brand of car and remain loyal to it your entire life, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that importers will be banned, but we can buy and sell cars
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amongst ourselves and put whatever model name on them we want,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you'll take what we give you, and if you want that cool energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;efficient hybrid car, you better do what we say.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There is nothing to prevent anyone else from building their own
<br>
networks, in fact economics 101 will tell you if we are the only
<br>
network there is no way prices are ever going to go down. The more
<br>
PLECs the higher the prices will be.
<br>
<p>I am simply stating facts. The RBOC's do not need to build a fiber
<br>
network simply to supply local telephone service.
<br>
<p>I am not merely an RBOC employee, but a customer. I want fiber as
<br>
much as anyone, but I can also read the numbers, and without a
<br>
change that's not going to happen.
