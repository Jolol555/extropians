<p>If you think transhumanism is mainly about the adoption of new
<br>
technology, then of course being a transhumanist makes early adoption
<br>
mandatory. But if you think transhumanism is about taking charge
<br>
of one's life to make it as good as possible, then there is no need to
<br>
get the latest gadget just because it is the latest gadget with the most
<br>
functions.
<br>
<p>Personally I do not feel the need to discard tools I know and use well
<br>
unless the perceived benefit of getting the next version is higher than
<br>
the cost of re-learning to use the tool. My cellphone is not top of the
<br>
line, but the value of the newer features is so small to me that it is
<br>
not worth it to get a new one before this one breaks. 
<br>
<p>The interesting issue is how much time to spend looking at capabilities
<br>
of new stuff and estimating their value to me. The cost of time must be
<br>
smaller than the average value increase I get from buying new stuff.
