<em>&gt; When life extensionists appear on TV or radio, most of the audience do think

</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have life-saving technology today that people don't use.  People fight
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Eating health food costs money.  Quitting smoking costs willpower.  There
<br>
are costs associated with lifespan extension.  I agree that a fifty-year
<br>
Slow Singularity model, like you appear to be using, might kill off a lot
<br>
of the currently existent six billion, even if they could have survived by
<br>
&quot;just&quot; giving up cigarettes.  (Have you heard of Nancy Reagan's new
<br>
program to combat homelessness?  It's called:  &quot;Just get a house.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Eventually, though, even under a Slow Singularity model (and immediately,
<br>
under mine) immortality... and other things, such as not needing to work
<br>
all day in a life-force-draining environment... will reduce to a very
<br>
simple action:  Saying &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Do you want to be
<br>
immortal?&quot;  If anyone has the ability to voluntarily go on living their
<br>
messed-up life while watching other people become truly happy, it will be
<br>
because they aren't watching - because the Refusers are on Earth, and the
<br>
heirs to the humanity's real destiny are elsewhere, so as to eliminate
<br>
undesired (non-volitional) mental anguish on the part of those who
<br>
remain.  There are not many good reasons for keeping a human mind any
<br>
longer than necessary, but the ability to stay in interaction with the
<br>
undecided for a couple of years, and persuade as many people as possible
<br>
to follow the path of transhumanity, might be one of those rare reasons.
