<em>&gt; &gt; Can you imagine Plato without writing? In fact can you imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophizing (for best and worse) without writing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, that's very hard to imagine!  Let's see...  Socrates! 
</em><br>
<p>I have to tell you one thing, which is that Plato didn't really
<br>
tape-record the dialogues featuring Socrates, and that his dialogues
<br>
are not really transcripts of such dialogues. I hope you are not too
<br>
disappointed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't you think that the use of the dialogue form by Plato and later 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophers is telling here?  I mean you don't need the written word to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy
</em><br>
<p>You don't need the written word to argue. But you need the written
<br>
word 1) to remember your results, and think about them further,
<br>
instead of forgetting them from one day to the next, or even from one
<br>
part of the discussion to a later part, and 2) to read the results of
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>Arguing is only one part of philosophizing. For example, we are now
<br>
arguing. I made a suggestion; you suggested agressively that it was
<br>
stupid; I answered with a bit of irony. This is fine, but it is not
<br>
really philosophizing. It's a mixed, social and intellectual thing.
<br>
Arguing is an important fitness factor, as you need to convince people
<br>
to do things, to suggest to people around that you are more
<br>
intelligent than your interlocutor, etc. But this is not science or
<br>
philosophy.
<br>
<p>You don't think seriously by responding publically to agressive
<br>
remarks. You think seriously by maturing problems over time (including
<br>
by discussion), then making an effort of writing, formulation, then
<br>
re-reading it and reflecting about it, having other intelligent people
<br>
read it, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- any more than you need writing to do reasoning, logic, math, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve problems, etc.  Surely, it helps out, but how much?
</em><br>
<p>Very. Remember that the human brain is unchanged since a very long
<br>
time. The reason why it seems so different now is it is full of very
<br>
sophisticated cultural products; those rely on the written word to
<br>
develop. Oral tradition can only go so far.
<br>
<p>And this is the real way I intended this link between writing and
<br>
philosophy. The idea is not that any person worth the name
<br>
&quot;philosopher&quot; must have written many books. The idea is that you can't
<br>
get to a certain level of elaboration in thought if you don't live in a
<br>
society in which writing has been invented. We were talking about world
<br>
view developpement in various societies, remember?
<br>
<p>In fact, Plato's dialogues very often refer to written things, be it
<br>
Homer, Solon, and various thinkers (sorry I'm not sure about the
<br>
English names, and email won't let me type them in Greek).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Even when you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read something on philosophy, you still have to do the work in your head.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you must do it in your head, but you can rely on the stability of
<br>
the written word to get back to it, re-read it, write your results,
<br>
think about them, have someone else read them, etc.
<br>
<p>The STABILITY of the written word is what matters. You can get back to
<br>
it. Even if your mood changes, or if you get distracted, it will stay
<br>
as it is.
<br>
<p>Our brain was not designed to do philosophy (nor science) as you may
<br>
realize. It was designed to be distracted, to react in real time to
<br>
threats, etc. We manage to think more refined thoughts with the aid of
<br>
that intellectual augmentation called writing.
<br>
<p>Even the discussions we're having (for all its rhetoric and social
<br>
aspects) couldn't reliably happen without writing. It would be less
<br>
precise, I couldn't refer precisely to what you said, etc. Not to
<br>
mention the infinity of written word it relies on. Socrates to start
<br>
with (unless you've known him personally).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If not, then can you claim to have done philosophy (or math or science or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything that involves more than memorizing a result)? 
</em><br>
<p>I feel you are deceiving yourself about the capacity of your own
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>There is a nice quote from Frege (sorry, I don't have those books with
<br>
me anymore) that says something about how intellectually primitive and
<br>
fluctuating our mental life is without the written word. I'm sure some
<br>
of you have it somewhere (I think it's in an introductory article to
<br>
his Begriffsschrift, something like &quot;Why we need a Begriffsschrift&quot;).
<br>
