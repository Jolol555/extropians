&quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; wrote
<br>
<p>&lt;Now, given the genetic technologies I expect will develop within
<br>
this decade, there is a reasonable chance that we will be able
<br>
to give everyone the benefits of the Methuselah gene.  If so
<br>
we will be bumping average longevity from ~75 to ~90 within
<br>
this decade, or ~15 years / decade.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&lt;If that proves to be the case, then the expected longevity of
<br>
everyone on the list under the age of ~65 just became *much*
<br>
greater!&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's certainly the assumption I'm working on.
<br>
<p>&lt;Now, the &quot;harsh&quot; reality of this brings up an interesting question.
<br>
I've always thought that there should be a fundamental shift
<br>
in personal economic planning that takes place when people begin
<br>
to realize they are likely to live hundreds of years.  I call
<br>
this &quot;The no-brainer strategy to becoming wealthy&quot;.  It requires
<br>
taking $100-$1000 and depositing it in a savings account or
<br>
mutual fund and never withdrawing any funds from the account
<br>
until the annual increase in the account value exceeds what
<br>
one reasonably needs to live in the world.  It is based on
<br>
the idea that it doesn't require sophisticated investment
<br>
strategies to become wealthy, it simply requires living long
<br>
enough.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This rather goes without saying.
<br>
<p>&lt;It would seem that Extropians/Transhumanists should be the first
<br>
to recognize the paradigm shift and adopt this strategy.  But
<br>
I don't see any evidence that any of these individuals that I
<br>
know have done so.  So the &quot;interesting question&quot; is &quot;Why
<br>
is this the case?&quot;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Querry. How would you know?  The sorts of uberlong-term
<br>
finance decisons one would be making as a potential methuseleh
<br>
are not that different from the ones a rational person makes
<br>
anyway.  
<br>
<p>&lt;Possible explanations I can think of are:
<br>
a) We don't really believe lifespan extension of more than 1 yr/yr
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is feasible;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a ridiculous assumption..at least till the extension reachs
<br>
a point we call &quot;indefinite&quot; then who knows?
<br>
&lt;b) We believe the NanoSantas will make all wealth creation strategies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to think there will be groups/govs/corps restricting the
<br>
spread of bionano, and drextech may take a century to actualize.
<br>
In this case ... wealth creation is not especially irrelevant.
<br>
&lt;c) We believe the SysOp AI will make all wealth creation strategies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in God the Father Maker of Heaven and Earth and in...
<br>
&lt;d) We belive the singularity will so totally disrupt things that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all wealth creation strategies are irrelevant.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This might happen. But one should plan for the event that
<br>
poverty is possible post-singularity, and so is wealth...
<br>
in the happy event this doesn't happen..well that's just
<br>
peachy.
<br>
<p>&lt;There are probably some others but I think this may cover
<br>
most of the positions.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You forgot laziness, denial, and lack of focus. 
<br>
<p>&lt;We could have a long discussion about the synergistic effects
<br>
of biomedical technology, computers, Moore's Law, AI, etc.
<br>
that make it impossible to disentangle lifespan extension
<br>
from NanoSantas from SysOps from singularities, but in
<br>
the end the question would remain -- Do you want to bet
<br>
your future survivability on the requirement that the
<br>
Nanosantas, Sysops or singularities manifest themselves?&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I may be a fool, but not a great fool.
<br>
<p>&lt;Does one want to be in a position in 30-50 years of
<br>
having an extended lifespan (through in-the-trenches
<br>
advances in medical technology) but not have the ability
<br>
to live independently and dedicate ones resources to
<br>
such things as the development of NanoSantas or SysOps
<br>
or Singularities?&gt;
<br>
<p>Nope. Which means &quot;due diligence&quot; :)
<br>
<p>&lt;To my mind, what may be needed is the establishment of
<br>
an &quot;I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation&quot; for people
<br>
who adopt and promote this perspective.  It is a fundamental
<br>
shift from the:&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why a Foundation? People do this with their portfolios
<br>
already, or should. Why does uberlongterm fiscal prudence
<br>
need public advocacy?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&lt;Who wants to join the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation?&quot;
<br>
and is willing to walk their talk?&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What's up with the advocacy thing?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic outlines of a plan. Best to have a mortgage-free
<br>
residence, preferably isolated from major population centers,
<br>
best Net access tech can affordably supply, with off-the-grid
<br>
power and water, and a half-years rations and reprovisioning
<br>
ability in the form of a multi-use conservatory. Make sure
<br>
the structure is stone, or one of those eco-domes that
<br>
lasts forever with no maintainance. (these can be financed
<br>
rather inexpensively actually). Passive/active solar etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(This is referred to around one's relations as the &quot;vacation
<br>
home/cabin I'm going to retire to&quot;.).  Get something on the beach
<br>
somewhere remote if possible.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The core funds should (IMHO) be placed in Swiss anuities,
<br>
as this is a (effectively) a legal way to save funds and acrue
<br>
interest on them, and not tell Uncle Sam about them without
<br>
breaking the US tax code. In 50-100 years you might cash
<br>
out...deal with the tax implications then. But no reporting
<br>
requirements till then. Rates are not as good as mutuals but
<br>
it's in a reserve currency (francs) with metal backing.
<br>
3-8% plus no inflation ain't bad.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously nano might make this backing irrelevant but
<br>
you hedge your bets. If the swiss go belly up half the world's
<br>
f**ked anyway.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd just dovetail it with your cryo-funding you know?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the annuities' beneficary the panamanian foundation
<br>
who owns the house.  Make the PF perpetual so the house is
<br>
waiting on you when you thaw. Course this sort of arrangement
<br>
has to be irrevocable but that's rather the point of uberlong
<br>
fiscal prudence yes?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously other sorts of investments might have tax implications
<br>
which of course opens up a whole nother can of worms,
<br>
dealing with the IRS, etc. which is of course something you'd
<br>
discuss with a JD or CPA right?  I'm thinking in terms of
<br>
keeping it simple, clearly legal, and idiot-proof.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to swallow my bile and get a degree in finance! lol.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regards,
<br>
Brian
