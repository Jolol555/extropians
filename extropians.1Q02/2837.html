It is impossible for me to comment on this without making some reference to 
<br>
the other posts on this issue. However, rather than rehashing the opposing 
<br>
arguments, I selected the segments most relevant and insightful (only posted 
<br>
as of yesterday) to the matter at hand - that being the rights &amp; treatment 
<br>
*by the State* of drug addicts.

<p>I probably wouldn't have replied, as I'm new to the list, but I was

compelled by the following post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: &quot;Arona Ndiaye&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:andiaye@chello.nl?Subject=Re:%20Bye-Bye%20to%20the%20&gt;H%20Right%20Wing%20-&gt;Drugs%20&amp;%20addicts">andiaye@chello.nl</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;Greetings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I ask to Mike Lorrey:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What negative experience have you had with drugs ? (directly or indirectly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Have you ever used any ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the answer to the first question is anything but &quot;none&quot;, please share. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We are here to discuss, not to destroy other's arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the answer to the second question is 'no', it would be wise for you to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'chill' when discussing that topic. You're not knowledgeable enough on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;topic at hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And just reading books and papers don't mean shit in this case. You cannot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'attack' users without having been one and you cannot attack them AFTER 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having been one yourself. If you just have a pretty 'tough' stance but do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not explain why, people might label you as a 'troll', just like it's done 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on Slashdot on in newsgroups/mailing lists etc... I'm sure you actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wantto discuss things, don't you ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In that case, you still need to start...
</em><br>
<p>I must admit, I didn't expect to encounter such insightful perspectives on 
<br>
addiction on this list. Of course, there is a stigma attached to addicts by 
<br>
society at large. Unfortunately, however, the misconception of addiction has 
<br>
infiltrated the realm of the more highly educated as well, and we sometimes 
<br>
find that people who &quot;should know better&quot; really have no clue. That's why I 
<br>
find the above posts so refreshing.
<br>
I've been reluctant to post anything but Arona's reply really compelled me, 
<br>
&amp; I said to myself, &quot;now *here* is something I actually *know* about!&quot; For 
<br>
me, this is Synchronicity working overtime. Being terrified of sounding 
<br>
stupid, I would have never imagined I would willingly disclose this, but 
<br>
this exchange is somthing... So I apologize if my contributions right now 
<br>
are limited only to my personal experience.
<br>
<p>2 months ago I tried to kill myself (&amp; nearly succeeded). After my lovely 
<br>
stay in the trauma unit at McLean Hospital, (yes, the Girl, Interrupted one. 
<br>
Apparently, lots of other famous people went there, like Sylvia Plath but I 
<br>
guess they weren't so successful with her!:P) I was transferred to Drug 
<br>
Rehab. Why was I going there? I thought I was just crazy? And so, &quot;recovery&quot; 
<br>
just came out of nowhere &amp; bit me in the ass. Needless to say, the education 
<br>
I have gained throughout this process has been priceless. But one thing 
<br>
emerges as an indesputable fact from all this - No one can get sober unless 
<br>
they *WANT* to.
<br>
<p>I agree with Mike Lorrey that:
<br>
&lt;&lt;the claims that drug use is a 'victimless crime' is notas black and white, 
<br>
slam dunk as many legalization proponents would liketo claim. Having been in 
<br>
the trenches of dealing with addicts, the damage they do ALWAYS extends 
<br>
beyond themselves as individuals&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>But that's about where it ends for me.
<br>
So my only point of contention with Amara would be this: don't be deceived 
<br>
into thinking addiction is a victimless crime. Legally, perhaps, that may 
<br>
usually be the case, but the mental, emotional, &amp; financial damages 
<br>
inflicted upon others can be devestating enough to qualify as victimization. 
<br>
Other than that, I think you are totally right on in your evaluation.
<br>
<p>The FACT of the matter is that you cannot force an addict/alcoholic to get 
<br>
clean. Nothing in existence can keep the afflicted from that next hit or 
<br>
drink or whatever EXCEPT their own free will to *choose* to stop. S/He will 
<br>
require assisstance (sometimes a great deal) to carry out this choice 
<br>
completely, but the *choice* by necessity must be freely &amp; willingly made by 
<br>
the addict of his/her own accord.
<br>
This stands in stark contrast to the idea posted by Mike:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are you advocating that an addict has a greater right to get high and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drive their kids off a cliff than their kids have to continue living?
</em><br>
[This is just nonsense &amp; inappropriate]
<br>
<em>&gt;Such individuals are no longer freely acting adult citizens.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. They are indeed freely acting and their action is to use. Just 
<br>
because you think they are wrong in their decision doesn't mean that they 
<br>
are not freely making it. Not all junkies *want* to get sober &amp; my feeling 
<br>
is that if they don't want to put in the effort when given the opportunity, 
<br>
then they are fucking themselves. The State need not waste money or 
<br>
resources on people who continue to make the *choice* to use.
<br>
<p>Reason wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;Anyhow. &quot;War on *&quot; = stupid. Not even evil, just stupid, stupid, &gt;stupid. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We live in a sick, controlling society that encourages denial &gt;and a lack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of responsibility, can't look beyond tomorrow, curtails &gt;freedoms for idiot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons and looks more and more like the worst of &gt;Europe. Career 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politicians are a major source of stupidity, popularity &gt;contents are no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way to run a society.
</em><br>
<p>EXACTLY! In fact, accepting responsibility for ones own actions, (past, 
<br>
present, &amp; future) is literally the first step in treatment of addiction. 
<br>
Addicts cannot get sober without first taking full responsibility for 
<br>
themselves &amp; their condition. That's mostly why AA &amp; NA have such monumental 
<br>
success - completely voluntary, totally self-supporting, based on tolerance 
<br>
&amp; open-mindedness, &amp; absolutely free from any State or religious doctrine - 
<br>
compared with many state-funded programs (including prisons) that function 
<br>
with the sole purpose of pulling in funding (State employees need to get 
<br>
their jobs *somewhere).
<br>
<p>as Amara pointed out:
<br>
<em>&gt;I do not find your Means acceptable. Once you tell the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it's OK to throw someone in jail or take their property because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of some behavior that is not harming anyone else, but that you find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unacceptable, then what comes next? Firing them, evicting them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;denying them credit, stripping away their civil rights, and the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goes on without end. If a person chooses to diminish their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by using some drugs, then they have every right to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All drug use carries a risk, and the risks are varied. As an adult,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each makes his/her own decision as to whether to expose themself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that drug, and one measures the potential good/harm against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own personal form of measure.
</em><br>
<p>Even without interference from the State, an addict can manage perfectly 
<br>
well to destroy &amp; lose everything of value in life. Therefore, the 
<br>
rehabilitative benefits Mike cited from such losses can be preserved. For 
<br>
example, just within the timeframe of my treatment, I have been forced to 
<br>
drop out of school in my senior year, I was evicted from my apartment in DC, 
<br>
I lost my scholarship, my partner, my job, blah blah blah. And none of this 
<br>
involved the State - I managed to destroy my life by my own hand &amp; all the 
<br>
consequences I faced were a DIRECT result of my own decision to use. I think 
<br>
this is immensely important because there was no scapegoat - I could NOT use 
<br>
the State as the fallguy for my demise &amp; so I was forced to accept total 
<br>
responsibility for the actions, MY actions, which brought me there. I fucked 
<br>
myself up big time &amp; I deserved everything I got - I had it coming. For this 
<br>
reason, I think it is ESSENTIAL to the rehabilitation of the addict that the 
<br>
State NOT be involved on any level. I cannot stress this point enough. The 
<br>
individual MUST take full &amp; total responsibility before reaping any benefits 
<br>
from treatment.
<br>
<p>Amara also highlighted another crucial factor in this issue:
<br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Inform yourself, then choose&quot;. The best way to remove the largest &gt;dangers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regarding drug use is education .. not throwing that person &gt;into jail !!
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't agree more. An old friend (a programmer) brought some books for 
<br>
me to borrow while in treatment. Reading about Omega Point Theory I felt 
<br>
sparked but I was left rather unsatiated. I decided I had no choice but to 
<br>
refresh my (elementary) knowledge in math &amp; physics so I could advance to 
<br>
more interesting subjects. So I managed to get some textbooks &amp; I started 
<br>
reviewing (yes, while in the hospital &amp; rehab). Once I got out I did some 
<br>
quick searching online, which lead me to transhumanism &amp; extropy. I was 
<br>
blown away. It was new to me, but it all seemed so familiar in a way - 
<br>
perhaps because (unlike most things in the free world) it actually made 
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p>So I guess to answer Reason's question:
<br>
<em>&gt;Blah, blah, blah, heard it all before, possibly even from me, what are &gt;we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to do about it?
</em><br>
<p>I would have to agree with Amara - EDUCATE. Put the word out there &amp; (at 
<br>
least try to) have faith that people will follow. Just like you can't force 
<br>
a junkie into sobriety, you can't force a person to change the way they 
<br>
think - even if its an improvement - it just doesn't work that way. But I 
<br>
wouldn't have even made it this far without education, specifically science. 
<br>
Early sobriety is like schizophrenia without all the noise. At such a 
<br>
critical time, I found science &amp; math to be a great comfort because, unlike 
<br>
society or religion, I could trust them.
<br>
<p>I know I'm not very smart &amp; stand to gain a great deal more from this list 
<br>
than I could ever hope to contribute, so I'm just grateful for the exposure 
<br>
to such great ideas &amp; exchanges. But I think, if nothing else, it proves 
<br>
that if someone, regardless of education or intelligence, is open &amp; willing 
<br>
to *understand* then a great deal can be accomplished. so again, if anyone 
<br>
has any suggestions/instructions for me, feel free; self-ed, while 
<br>
gratifying, is still a bitch so I'd welcome the help :P
<br>
Thanks so much,
<br>
Vanessa
