<em>&gt; &gt; Josh Wolfe, co-founder and managing partner of Lux Capital ...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the more far-out side, one business proposal Wolfe recently saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; involved cryogenically freezing the deceased and bringing them back with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nanobots in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As far as Wolfe is concerned, any technology based on the &quot;Drexlerian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vision of nanotech&quot;--that is, the self-replicating assembler--should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; put in its place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are not &quot;over the hump&quot; yet by any stretch of the imagination.
</em><br>
<p>I have felt for some time that cryonics was a lead weight dragging down
<br>
acceptance of Drexlerian nanotech.  My theory is that people have an
<br>
overwhelmingly negative emotional reaction to cryonics, in part because
<br>
it implies that the death of their loved ones was preventable, and this
<br>
carries over to any technology which would seem to make cryonics credible.
<br>
<p>A couple of years ago, Foresight essentially declared victory in the
<br>
war for acceptance of nanotechnology.  There were conferences held every
<br>
year, one or more respected journals, government funding was ramping up,
<br>
articles in business journals.  By all accounts it was now an accepted
<br>
future technology.
<br>
<p>But maybe that was premature.  We are seeing a backlash, a rearguard
<br>
fighting action against the original vision of nanotech.  Opponents are
<br>
trying to build a firewall against Drexlerian mechanosynthesis, drawing a
<br>
distinction between their prosaic nanotech and Drexler's far-out visions.
<br>
They prefer to focus on biotech, on nanoparticles, on MEMS, on bulk
<br>
materials engineering at the nanoscale.  All these things can be done
<br>
today, in fact they are the natural consequence of existing technologies
<br>
just extending their capabilities a bit.  They want to get funding for
<br>
their current research.  In this environment there is no reason to even
<br>
think about blue sky dreams like eternal perfect health, or nightmares
<br>
like engineered malignant replicators.
<br>
<p>I think Foresight needs to go back to its roots and shore up the
<br>
foundations.  It's not enough to have &quot;nanotechnology&quot; initiatives showing
<br>
up everywhere.  Few of those efforts are making significant progress
<br>
towards Drexler's machine-based models.  Foresight needs to remind
<br>
people that there is more to nanotech than making ultra-fine powders
<br>
for smoother paint.  We have to keep our eye on the prize, a technology
<br>
which can utterly revolutionize every aspect of the world.  If research
<br>
is not moving us towards that goal, it should not receive funding under
<br>
nanotech grants, even if it happens to involve little tiny pieces.
