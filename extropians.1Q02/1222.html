<p>You probably can pre-program something &quot;robotic&quot; with limited adaptive
<br>
capability to transform nearby solar systems and then &quot;fork&quot; yourself
<br>
into said system (it has to be *very* close however because you need
<br>
to build very large arrays of transmitters &amp; receivers to get the
<br>
information that one solar system can contain copied over into another
<br>
in the brief period that they may be relatively &quot;near&quot; each other).
<br>
<p>The problem is, as I believe Ken and Eugene have pointed out, once
<br>
copied it doesn't remain the same.  I am not the person that I was
<br>
10 years ago.  Societies of individuals may vary even more.
<br>
<p>I don't know how you would go about preserving trust relationships
<br>
over 1 million year evolutionary paths much less 100 million year paths.

</em><br>
<p>So far yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A kg of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential energy, but it can generate 3e14 J of energy through nuclear
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sure, but you have to have sufficient metals to burn it in a fusion
<br>
reactor.  Until we have &quot;reasonable&quot; estimates for the metal-to-energy
<br>
ratio for a &quot;real&quot; system (say the ITER) it seems difficult to assess
<br>
whether star harvesting can be self-bootstrapping.  If you've made a
<br>
trip through a metal-rich region and built 0.01-0.1 M_sun worth of
<br>
fusion reactors, then yes, I agree that would be able to dismantle
<br>
stars much faster.
