Unless there is a magical hyperspace or phase space to which the Jupiter 
<br>
Minds can upload, explore, inhabit; they will need the visible Universe to 
<br>
live in.  So, therefore all the better to change things around to suit there 
<br>
needs.
<br>
<p>Example: Just because we humans today (in this country) rarely drink directly 
<br>
from rivers, and lakes; the water still comes from the same place. Aquifers, 
<br>
and desalinated water would be the huge exception to the rule. But we still 
<br>
require water to live, and far more water then our hunter-gather grand-sires 
<br>
of 1 million years ago. And for greater reasons. We, essentially still have 
<br>
need for water even after a million years!
<br>
<p>Now apply this 'water' example to hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, iron,etc. We use 
<br>
these materials to survive with, to build with, but compared to an Uber 
<br>
civilization of J-minds; we may be frugal indeed! If that is the case, 
<br>
wouldn't their exploits at recovering useful materials be an interstellar 
<br>
wonder-show?
<br>
<p><a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20MEDIA:%20NOVA%20on%20Gamma%20Ray%20Bursters">jr@shasta.com</a> gave thought to:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Why? Just because it may seem sensible to us to engineer the universe, that
<br>
doesn't mean that a civilization a million years more advanced than us would
<br>
see it that way. Consider, if you will, that engineering the universe could
<br>
seem quite childish to a more advanced (and more mature) species. As you 
<br>
point
<br>
out, our civilization is relatively young. So, look what older civilizations
<br>
on Earth have produced: Buddha, Lao Tzu, Patanjali, Mahavira, et al. Perhaps
<br>
when our civilization matures a bit more, we'll become more interested in our
<br>
hyper-cognitive, rather than our engineering skills.&gt;&gt;
