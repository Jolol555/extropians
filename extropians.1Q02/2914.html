<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; I agree, but one has to ask what what level of &quot;proof&quot; would be

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rushing to sign up for this clinical trial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am guessing that we would have uncovered astounding, anomalies, had such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'unusal bacteria, prions, existed. There are lots of biologist who would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reported something 'very curious'. So far, no great surprises. When I first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read Professor Walkers' proposal of the question,  the idea of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitochondria inside the cells of just about everything living, might be such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an anomaly. But why not just accept the more obvious argument, that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an earthly, phenomena?
</em><br>
<p>I think that Persinger's experiments with triggering hypnogogic seizures
<br>
(i.e. the 'religious' or 'abduction' experience) with cycling magnetic
<br>
fields on the brain demonstrate that there is a significant degree of
<br>
stimuli needed to trigger these odd experiences, which could be easily
<br>
triggered by nanoprobes tapping directly into the neural net of the
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>One need not slice and dice brains to find them, I think.
<br>
<p>I just went to donate blood today and participated in the pheresis
<br>
procedure, where they filter out the red blood cells and give you back
<br>
your plasma and platelets. A similar process could be instituted on
<br>
college campuses to process students blood and test it for presence of
<br>
nanoprobes and their side products. If you expect that x percent of
<br>
nanoprobes will fail in a given amount of time, you should find some in
<br>
any given sample of blood.
<br>
<p>Now, to prevent the nanites from suspecting anything, if you disguise
<br>
the process as a run of the mill pheresis procedure, so that even the
<br>
students dont know they are being scanned, then it should be possible to
<br>
spot them if they are in fact there. Now, you could target specific
<br>
individuals by running a totally separate study to privately interview
<br>
individuals who have had hynogogic experiences in the past, then focus
<br>
on them when they go to 'give blood'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would argue that technically, it would seem that it would be easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing a computer that runs a simulation, that merely moves electrons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around in continuous off-on states, then it might be to slam 50 kilograms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, that may have been somehow, pre-programmed, and produce life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensation, and intelligence. I could be wrong on this, but do not see how.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the question of the presence of nano-probes or even
<br>
nano-civilizations living as 'crypto-dirt' is a very important test to
<br>
the question of whether we live in a simulation, because if you accept
<br>
the reasoning of the Fermi Paradox, either they are here as nanites and
<br>
we just haven't detected them yet, or else they aren't here for the
<br>
simple reason that the universe is a simulation which is FAR younger
<br>
than our observations would indicate, which is why we have not seen
<br>
alien species jetting all over (or living as nanites in our brains or in
<br>
the dustmice.)
