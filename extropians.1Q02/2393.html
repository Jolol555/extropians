<em>&gt; &gt;Not to the technologist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless said technologist accepts magic is a part of everyday 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life. It's really not that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special a thing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, no, not even then. Technology indistinguishable from magic is
<br>
definitely distinguishable by those that make it, excepting maybe catalogue
<br>
engineers. For example, ask Doug if he thinks a rocket engine is magic. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Not to the posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if that posthuman creates a simulated universe? At least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the inhabitants of that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, said posthuman would be a god.
</em><br>
<p>Only because of ignorance or a lack of ability on the part of the
<br>
inhabitants, neither of which is their fault. The posthuman is then a god to
<br>
the inhabitants through choice; is that likely? Or at all ok?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I want to be able to understand it better than that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Magic is useless if you don't understand it. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding has to be suppresed at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time of the working, but saying that something happens for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some arbitrary reason like an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unmeasurable spiritual power is pointless, and usually means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that someone is talking out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their ass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, mystical spacewalk time...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You can't strive toward magic; it is in essence indefinable, and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;untargetable. It contains the set of all (or some?) things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;comprehend. By definition, as we come to comprehend them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they cease to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;magical, and become part of the toolkit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I beg to differ. I may not be able to describe a sigil as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concrete equation, but i 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how it works, and know that it works. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nevertheless, I think most people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would describe making something happen by having sex while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about a weird 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass of squiggles that once made up a coherent sentance is magic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'd describe it as BS, but maybe I'm not suppressing my understanding
<br>
carefully enough :-)
<br>
<p>More seriously, it is either bollocks, which isn't magic, or it really does
<br>
work, which just means it is something we don't properly understand. The
<br>
extropian position might be &quot;Take that bonking off to the lab for
<br>
examination...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Off the top of my head, striving for &quot;God&quot; has a couple of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It can mean striving for potence and control... I can agree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that (gee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what a blokey definition!). But I would not label it God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would. 
</em><br>
<p>In that case, God is synonymous with most of human endeavour. Maybe that's
<br>
true, but the term becomes useless, and is problematic because of it's
<br>
connotational loading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Or, it could mean striving to somehow become closer to that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;than/beyond us, and on that score, who really gives a rat's? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;even makes sense, I suspect that the closer we get to &quot;god&quot;, the less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;interesting it will become. It wont become any less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;having started at the maximum on that scale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The posthuman is greater than/beyond us.
</em><br>
<p>No, it isn't, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, &quot;the posthuman&quot; isn't... it
<br>
is merely speculation. One day there may be posthumans, and then they will
<br>
be us, so hardly greater than us. Secondly, by the time we can be
<br>
posthumans, we will understand the technology, or will come to as we become
<br>
posthuman. That surely would be an amazing journey of discovery, but it
<br>
doesn't involve magic or gods of any kind. Just good 'ole us. 
<br>
<p>Please don't deify or mystify the concepts of transhumanism; they cease to
<br>
make any real sense in such a context. The human that recreates itself into
<br>
something new, using only the power of its wits, the material around it, and
<br>
the insights of its dead ancestors, is an incredible vision. Visit a
<br>
library, jump on the net, walk down a crowded city street and experience
<br>
what we do. Hold something plastic in your hand. Then tell me why we would
<br>
need to worship a god.
