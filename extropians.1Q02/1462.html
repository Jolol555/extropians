----- &gt; Well-known business analyst Al Ries's outlines a marketing
<br>
language --
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;positioning&quot; yourself and repositioning existing organizations to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more room for yourself.  (The best selling book _Positioning the Battle
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; the Mind_ outlines this strategy.) Trying to put ExI or extropians in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small corner of transhumanism and claim all the rest while also welcoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that small corner, is a clear machination of the true situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had hoped that WTA would realize its original premise of being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academic organization.  I don't know why that didn't work, but trying to
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;new&quot; political organization for transhumanists is going run into some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.  It simply won't work with the current strategy, which I stated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Al Ries--Yikes.;) Perhaps we should take a page from his _Focus_ (his
<br>
digression from marketing into business management) and concentrate on our
<br>
core business (which is promoting transhumanism). The WTA seeks to have a
<br>
fairly broad political umbrella and its Executive committee exemplifies
<br>
this. The WTA has not attempted to position in itself vis a vis ExI in terms
<br>
of politics.(Indeed, it would be very difficult to. It has been made
<br>
abundantly clear here lately that ExI is not to be identified with
<br>
libertarianism in its political orientation but I haven't seen any
<br>
discussion of exactly how far &quot;left&quot; one can be and still qualify as an
<br>
Extropian. I did notice, however, Max mentioned a while back that he thinks
<br>
that government investment in research can be justified in some cases). If I
<br>
were to advocate a Riesian marketing strategy to the WTA it would be that
<br>
the WTA is a democratic organization--somewhat of a rarity in transhumanist
<br>
circles. But of course this would be pointless because we are not
<br>
competitors--we share the same Focus.
