[This may get threaded wrong on Javien.  I deleted Samantha's message that I'm
<br>
responding to, so I'm responding to the closest place I can find, which is
<br>
Lee's response to the msg I'm answering.]
<br>
<p>My comments are quoted by an even number of &quot;&gt;&quot;, while Samantha's have an odd
<br>
number.  Zero is an even number.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Increasingly it may not be economically feasible to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;hire and train people in many companies, at least not people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;below a certain intelligence and level of training. What then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;for these people who are no longer hirable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [I assume &quot;companies&quot; is a typo for &quot;countries&quot;.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would you assume that? It does not follow.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  Glad I was explicit about what I thought you meant.  
<br>
<p>I assumed it because, in my world view, it is not the responsibility 
<br>
of companies to ensure that &quot;people below a certain intelligence and 
<br>
level of training&quot; are employable.  
<br>
<p>You seem to believe that it's a collective responsibility, so I groped for
<br>
an interpretation of something that didn't make sense to me otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; One of the charities I give to (as I've mentioned before) is Trickle Up. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This is commendable. But the question remains of what happens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when these measures prove inadequate.
</em><br>
<p>People do something about it.  You keep implying that you think the right 
<br>
answer is &quot;People force other people to do something about it&quot;, but you 
<br>
disclaim any actual plan.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What of those others who have no aunts and uncles, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents or other benefactors in such a position and with such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generosity? Are we to say it is ok to lose those minds, minds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may have been of great benefit?
</em><br>
<p>I said (immediately following the sentence you reacted to) that I believe
<br>
that everyone should be allowed to deduct contributions for education
<br>
given to anyone.  I won't get any tax advantage for contributing to my
<br>
nieces and nephews, so I'm only willing to do it for relatives.  If it was
<br>
tax deductible, many people and companies would give a lot.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The best the government could do would be to allow any tax payer to take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; deduction for any contribution to anyone's education. Doesn't matter whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the student is related or not. Same for corporations. More education is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for all of us, but making it an entitlement is bad for all of us.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't agree it is bad for all of us. 
</em><br>
<p>Okay, we'll have to disagree about that.  I believe making it something 
<br>
anyone can demand and the rest have to pay for (including poor people who 
<br>
pay taxes--remember that it's not just the rich that pay taxes) is wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As these things go it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one of the few entitlements that I believe makes sense. 
</em><br>
<p>If I believed in entitlements, I might agree with you.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I would limit it in that those who take advantage of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it must keep certain academic standards.
</em><br>
<p>It will be far easier for me to impose standards on my neices and nephews 
<br>
than for the government to impose any standards.  This is an aside about 
<br>
efficiency and effectiveness, not about morality.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The statistics (according to Julian Simon, of course) show that in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;? I am not altogether sure I can trust Julian Simon for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;statistics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Please, use any source of statistics you desire, or show any attacks on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Simon's work that provide better statistics, rather than attacking his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; motivation. Do you have any sources that disagree that the gap keeps getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; smaller? I think Simon's opponents are driven by envy, and think Simon's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; claims are irrelevant. If there's still a gap, then they will continue to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unhappy. Is this how you feel?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;No. I am unhappy because I personally know a great number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bright minds that are wasted and I recognize they are the tip of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the iceberg.  [...] So I am not awfully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impressed when I see fine graphs saying everything is getting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better. I do not personally believe it. I don't have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statistics to back it up but my gut says something is damn fishy.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  If personal experience is more convincing than statistics, whatever
<br>
the source, I'll stop here.  Simon's statistics summarize the experience
<br>
of far more people than you or I could ever talk to.  They abstract out a
<br>
lot of personal defeats and successes, but they're the best evidence we
<br>
have about the real effects of real policies in the real world over time.
<br>

C. J. Cherryh, &quot;Invader&quot;, on why we visit very old buildings:
      &quot;A sense of age, of profound truths.  Respect for something hands
      made, that's stood through storms and wars and time.  It 
      persuades us that things we do may last and matter.&quot;
