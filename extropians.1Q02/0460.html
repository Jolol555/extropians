</em><br>
<em> &gt; (You know -- survival of the fittest and all that...)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><p>What rights one has to a place in society are not necessarily 
<br>
dependent on whether one &quot;contributes&quot; to the society or not. 
<br>
At least it certainly need not be dependent when the society is 
<br>
rich enough to contain many members who seemingly contribute 
<br>
nothing at all.  This entire construct of &quot;contributing&quot; needs 
<br>
to be questioned.  Precisely what does &quot;contributing&quot; mean?  In 
<br>
whose judgment and by what criteria is this to be evaluated? 
<br>
Can it be evaluated for instance by whether or not enough people 
<br>
care enough for something one has or has produced or does to 
<br>
offer to pay sufficiently for it for those payments to be 
<br>
exchanged for the necessities and desires of the individual? 
<br>
What of those who are outside of the current envelope of what 
<br>
people find valuable enough to pay for?  There are many 
<br>
intensely creative and brilliant souls out there who cannot find 
<br>
anyone that will actually pay them for what they consider most 
<br>
important to do.  Should these be considered to be &quot;not 
<br>
contributing&quot;?  Or is the society actually likely to be much 
<br>
richer when people have the &quot;luxury&quot; of picking what they are 
<br>
most passionate at and pursuing that without their very survival 
<br>
being at stake if they don't choose something they can charge 
<br>
someone else a price for sharing?
<br>
<p>Also, implicit in this consideration is the assumption that the 
<br>
economics of the society are such that one needs to pay for 
<br>
one's needs explicitly.  As as been mentioned on this list 
<br>
several times, that is only one of many ways a posthuman culture 
<br>
might be organized and it is increasingly less likely, or at any 
<br>
rate less necessary, as the society moves from  one of assumed 
<br>
scarcity to assumed abundance.
<br>
<p>Is there a possible problem in that there might be too many 
<br>
individuals in a society where one did not survive or not based 
<br>
on whether one &quot;contributes&quot; with too many freeloaders or 
<br>
&quot;deadheads&quot; (no offense to Grateful Dead fans here)?  If it is a 
<br>
truly abundant society with few space/resource constraints I 
<br>
don't see that this is an issue as far as actualy physical drain 
<br>
on the society goes.  It might be an issue if all these persons, 
<br>
even ones with no understanding to speak of, have actual 
<br>
controlling votes in making decisions that affect the entire 
<br>
society.  One answer to this is to not have so much (if any) 
<br>
central authority.  Another answer is some form of competency 
<br>
testing on voters and perhaps weighing of votes.
<br>
<p>Overall, I see no good reason why one's survival should be tied 
<br>
to &quot;contributing&quot; to society in an extropian worldview.  Such 
<br>
criteria of &quot;contributing&quot; smacks of one's worth depending on 
<br>
pleasing others.  It goes against the grain.
