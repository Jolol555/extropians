<p>:-) Actually, what brought you to this text? It seems to be part of a
<br>
criticism of the current healthcare system. We have almost identical
<br>
criticisms here too against the conditions in many holes for elderly and how
<br>
slow and inefficient the healthcare system is to help those who need it the
<br>
most. 
<br>
<p>Which (in an attempt to make this thread extropianism relevant) brings up
<br>
the interesting issue of what an extropian health care system would involve
<br>
and how to bring it about. 
<br>
<p>Clearly the current systems, both the heavily socialized ones in Sweden and
<br>
Norway, and the far less socialized US system, are suboptimal in many ways
<br>
both at providing desired care and in the forms of care we as transhumanists
<br>
would like to have. It would useful to identify the basic assumptions (like
<br>
only supplying 'health', not improvement, and that 'health' is the same for
<br>
everybody) made that make them diverge from what we want, and the practical
<br>
implementation issues that mess things up (ranging from public choice
<br>
effects leading to bloated bureaucracies to organisational structures that
<br>
promote an operational rather than humanistic view of patients).
