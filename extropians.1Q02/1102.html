<p>I fear I might sound more like my leftist school friend Daniel af Burén
<br>
(yes, the name signifies an aristocratic family) who once left the small
<br>
communist party KPLM(r) (the &quot;r&quot; means &quot;revolution&quot;) because they were
<br>
too bourgeoise :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a couple of points to pick... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - firstly, I think the argument about ruling out collectivism falls apart if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have a purely voluntary collective. I think that the core values you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have put forward allow any type of social arrangement as long as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purely voluntary for all members. Is this actually workable?
</em><br>
<p>I would argue that even if a number of people desire to form a voluntary
<br>
collectivist community, they are not going to be as successful at
<br>
reaching human excellence as they would in a less collectivist
<br>
community. But they are entirely free to do it, just as people are free
<br>
to pursue less efficient courses of action. I think it is important to
<br>
uphold the right of people to form any form of voluntary social
<br>
arrangement, and that it is largely workable (there are practical
<br>
issues, like defining voluntary and how to settle contracts with the
<br>
community being left, but that is part of the practical discussion that
<br>
begins once we start to move away from the principle discussion and into
<br>
implementation).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Second, and more important, I think the discussion reduces transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;humanism with toys&quot;, and I suspect there is more to it than that. How is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transhumanism that you have presented any different to plain vanilla
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanism?
</em><br>
<p>I think the core difference - and this is not readily apparent from my
<br>
long post - is that transhumanism has a somewhat different model of
<br>
human nature. In short, humanists have commonly assumed an essentialist
<br>
approach to human nature - it exists and is unchanging. This is why
<br>
quite a few humanist intellectuals today actually are against human
<br>
enhancement - if change of human nature is possible, then it is almost
<br>
axiomatically bad. The transhumanist approach is that human nature does
<br>
exist, but is processual. We are not so much human beings as human
<br>
becomings, constantly evolving in a fascinating interplay between genes,
<br>
environment and our own choices. This means that human nature can be
<br>
changed in many respects, and that it is not against human dignity to do
<br>
so. I hope to elaborate on this in an essay I'm working on, it is really
<br>
an important issue. 
<br>
<p>Second, traditional humanism did not have the scientific tools to fully
<br>
get into the issues of the true nature of the human and their
<br>
relationship with the universe. This means that humanist discourse is
<br>
based on concepts that were not based in the physical world (such as
<br>
free will), which works fine as long as we are dealing with only human
<br>
and human issues (bringing my basal ganglia into a discussion about what
<br>
I want mixes up the levels rather severely). The problem is that this
<br>
made humanism isolated towards the natural sciences and discoveries in
<br>
them, so that the more naturalistic results on human nature almost
<br>
always were seen as anti-humanist (like the determinism that Marx, Freud
<br>
and Skinner seemed to impose). But there is no need for this isolation
<br>
that only weakens humanism as neuroscience marches on - the humanist
<br>
concepts actually seem to have low-level explanations without having to
<br>
recourse to supernaturalism. So here there is a need for a
<br>
reconciliation, and a transhumanism is needed. 
<br>
<p>These two parts was just the ones at the top of my head. I think a more
<br>
careful writeup of what humanists have said and my concept of a
<br>
trans-humanism is needed.
