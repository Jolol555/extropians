<p>&lt;&lt;Two U.S. scientists have questioned the existence of black holes
<br>
and suggested, in their place, the existence of an exotic bubble of 
<br>
superdense matter, an object they call a gravastar. The two are pointing out 
<br>
that physicists have swept some &quot;humiliating&quot; problems with black holes under 
<br>
the carpet. 
<br>
<p>By confronting these problems, they claim to have found an alternative fate 
<br>
for a collapsing star. Emil Mottola of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 
<br>
New Mexico and Pawel Mazur of the University of South Carolina in Columbia 
<br>
think gravastars are cold, dense shells supported by a springy, weird space 
<br>
inside. They'd look like black holes, lit only by the material raining down 
<br>
onto them from outside. In fact, they seem to fit all the observational 
<br>
evidence for the existence of black holes. 
<br>
So far, however, physicists have mixed feelings about the idea of gravastars.
<br>
Their verdicts range from &quot;outstandingly brilliant&quot; to &quot;unlikely.&quot; What's
<br>
certain is that gravastars will rekindle a great debate of the early 20th
<br>
century: are black holes fact or fantasy? 
<br>
<p>The idea of black holes dates back to the First World War, when German
<br>
astronomer Karl Schwarzschild solved the equations of Einstein's newborn 
<br>
theory
<br>
of gravity while serving on the Russian front. He showed that space-time 
<br>
around
<br>
any massive star would be curved. Squeeze a large enough star into a tiny 
<br>
enough
<br>
space and its density would become infinite and the curvature of space-time
<br>
would spiral out of control. The gravity near one of these objects would be 
<br>
so
<br>
strong that nothing -- not even photons -- could escape its grasp. 
<br>
Einstein shared the view of most physicists of that time that such objects,
<br>
later dubbed black holes, were too outrageous to exist. He argued that it was
<br>
all academic anyway, since stars never shrink this small. But scientists
<br>
gradually became convinced that they do. If a star is very massive, it will
<br>
blast apart in a supernova &lt;<a href="http://www.cosmiverse.com/reflib/Supernova.htm">http://www.cosmiverse.com/reflib/Supernova.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
explosion at the end of its life; and if a core twice as heavy as the Sun
<br>
remains, no known force can prevent gravity squeezing it to a point.
<br>
<p>The result is a &quot;singularity&quot; with infinite density, where the known laws of
<br>
physics break down. The singularity's gravity would be so powerful it would 
<br>
be
<br>
cloaked in an &quot;event horizon&quot;, a boundary beyond which matter or light 
<br>
couldn't
<br>
escape. The dramatic idea of a black hole, which would rip to shreds anyone 
<br>
caught
<br>
inside it, fired the imaginations of scientists, artists and writers alike. 
<br>
But
<br>
no one has ever rooted the drama in fact. &quot;So far, there is no direct 
<br>
observational evidence to show that any of the things astronomers call black 
<br>
holes have event horizons or central singularities,&quot; says Neil Cornish, an 
<br>
astrophysicist at the University of Montana in Bozeman.
<br>

<br>
<p>We know there are compact objects millions of times as heavy as the Sun
<br>
that hog the centers of galaxies. These black hole candidates give themselves 
<br>
away because hot stars, gas and dust spiraling toward them emit bright 
<br>
X-rays. But that doesn't mean there's a cataclysmic black hole in the 
<br>
vicinity; it could simply be a very massive object. The debate petered out 
<br>
decades ago but there's still no ironclad
<br>
proof that black holes exist...&gt;&gt;
