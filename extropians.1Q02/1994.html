</em><br>
<p>This is silly. Yes, humans find the concept and word `purpose' especially
<br>
useful because we desire, intend, etc, but it's borrowed or adapted or
<br>
exapted from telic or goal-oriented or task-oriented phenomena that are
<br>
palpably *already out there* in the universe prior to us, prior to
<br>
consciousness. 
<br>
<p>A kidney gets built into a developing phenotype because that arrangement of
<br>
organized cells does a particular job acceptably well within a metabolizing
<br>
entity. It obviously has a *function*, then; and it would be perverse to
<br>
claim that it doesn't have a *purpose*. 
<br>
<p>That purpose was not *intended* by the evolutionary accidents and sievings
<br>
that built the kidney's constructional and operating code; there was no
<br>
outside mind *desiring* it. But each kidney serves a crucial purpose.
<br>
<p>Of course that is very different, as most of us have agreed, from making
<br>
the category mistake of leaping to the pseudo-question: what is *Life's*
<br>
purpose?
<br>
<p>And that realization in turn does not and cannot solve or abolish the
<br>
question `Why do I get up in the morning?' In my case, the answer is
<br>
perfectly, painfully obvious: my kidneys are getting clapped out as I age,
<br>
not serving their purpose as well as they once did, so I get up not just
<br>
once but several times in the morning... to take an urgent piss.

[not taking the piss] [as an Aussie would say]
