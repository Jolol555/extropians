<p>You can use whatever prefix seems appropriate.

Insisting on use of specific prefixes is imo far more

trouble than it's worth, and could get carried away...

Subject: PREFIX: More Suggested Prefixes
IRR: for Irrelevant posts having nothing to do with 
Extropianism 
NONSEQ: for nonsequitir posts which might have 
something to do with Extropianism or might not - 
reading makes you ask, &quot;Where the hell did that come 
from?&quot; 
NOTGUN: for posts which have nothing to do with guns 
or firearms in general 
PRIMGUN: for extropian discussions about flint-lock 
rifles and other ancient firearms 
HURL: if you need to talk about lethal projectile 
weapons other than guns, use this prefix (Extropian 
Archery, Camel Flinging, etc) 
BIGGUN: reserved for talking about firearms ranging 
from elephant guns up to battleship weapons 
FAKEGUN: talk about faux guns here 
ONTOPIC: for discussions which are actually on topic 
RAMBLING: insane rants and raves 
POWERTOOLS: for important extropian discourses on 
powertools 
PRIVATE: talk about your privates 
X: Custom prefix - follow with no more than 3 
characters representing whatever you wish - don't 
bother to explain. 
Please use the &quot;|&quot; character to concatenate the 
various prefixes which will describe your post. Ex: 
IRR|NOTGUN|FAKEGUN|PRIVATE: The &quot;Flamethrower&quot; 
This would be an irrelevant posting which would not be 
about firearms, but would be about fake guns and 
something to do with your &quot;privates&quot; region. Perhaps a 
pseudo-medical story.

Subject: Re: PREFIX: More Suggested Prefixes
Terry's suggested prefixes: 
    IRR NONSEQ NOTGUN PRIMGUN HURL BIGGUN FAKEGUN 
    ONTOPIC RAMBLING POWERTOOLS PRIVATE X 
&gt; Please use the &quot;|&quot; character to concatenate the 
&gt; various prefixes which will describe your post. Ex: 
&gt; 
&gt; IRR|NOTGUN|FAKEGUN|PRIVATE: The &quot;Flamethrower&quot; 
Come on. You expect people posting to mailing lists---
where you actually have to type!---to write subject 
lines like that? It would actually be something like: 
    IRR|NoTGUn /FAKEeGN|PRIVIT(sp?): The `Flamethroewr&quot; was (was:Re:arrrgh)) 
So, anyway, if I've understood your above prefix 
suggestions then I should be able to post, say, 
    LIRR|NOGUNRI|FAKEGUM|HURD|OCTOPIC|BIGGUS|PRIVATE: Urp 
which would be about a low-ranking soldier taking the 
Long Island Railroad toward the site of a massacre in 
Korea while working on the GNU (_not_ GUN) kernel and 
looking at an eight-photograph layout of a character 
from _The Life of Brian_ after finding some plastic 
for-display-only chewing gum and eating it.

Subject: HUMOR: More Suggested Prefixes
I just realized that a logical tree structure or path-
name would useful. This would allow the reader to 
determine which subtopic is being discussed, find the 
relationship between topics, and filter on whole 
categories. 
Thus, a flame about the recent elections could have 
the prefix of 
&quot;POLITICS/GOVERNMENT/PROCESS/ELECTION/PRESIDENTIAL/2000
/STATE/FLORIDA/BALLOT/SUBTYPE/BUTTERFLY/COMMENT/NEGATIV
E/REPLY/LONGISH:&quot; 
What could be more user-friendly?

Subject: Re: HUMOR: More Suggested Prefixes
We obviously need relative pathnames, so that we can 
signal topic drift by saying something like
../../POSITIVE/BENEFITS (&quot;let's look on the bright 
side of this ...&quot;) or ../../FLAME/HOT/HOTTER/HOTTEST 
(&quot;your granny wears army boots and your dad smells of 
elderberries!&quot;). 
Oh, and we need national or cultural signifiers: USA, 
NOTUSA, APPLEPIE, COMMIESUBVERSION, BELGIUM and so on.

Subject: Re: HUMOR: More Suggested Prefixes
Heck, while we are at it, why don't we just set up a 
nice, well planned out news server with all the 
categories set up....

Thus the absence of a focus on strict adherence to 
rules about subject prefixes. ;-)
Aumentar!
