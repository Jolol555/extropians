This article was printed in Portfolio Weekly (January 22nd issue) and
<br>
written by D.D. Delaney.
<br>
<p>I Want To Disbelieve
<br>
<p>PAT ROBERTSON, take note. A young man has come to Virginia Beach with a
<br>
mission to make the world safe for atheists and free-thinking secular
<br>
humanists, and his organizational model is the Christian Coalition.
<br>
<p>Clint O'Dell is just getting started, but, like Pat before him, he hopes to
<br>
go far. He has a vision of a global Atheist Coalition, with its own
<br>
broadcasting system, charities, and a political agenda to defeat faith-based
<br>
legislative initiatives and elect atheists to high office.
<br>
<p>Describing himself, at 23, as &quot;the youngest atheist activist there is,&quot;
<br>
O'Dell believes there is an atheist awakening dawning in America.
<br>
<p>I'm hoping to pick up (that) slow-moving ball,&quot; he says, &quot;put it in a
<br>
cannon, strike a match, and set off that cannon.&quot;
<br>
<p>In partnership with like-minded Lauren Floyd of Chesapeake, he has put out a
<br>
call for all doubters, skeptics, and non-believers to attend the first
<br>
meeting of Freethinkers and Atheists of Virginia on Sunday, Jan. 27, from
<br>
1-3 p.m. in the auditorium of the Virginia Beach Central Library.
<br>
<p>The organization's purpose, O'Dell says, is to achieve legitimacy for
<br>
atheism and &quot;to promote secular values.&quot; Membership is open to &quot;anyone who
<br>
is for helping to make America become more secular.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We have no idea&quot; how many people might turn out for the first meeting, says
<br>
Floyd, who, at 43, is O'Dell's senior partner in the start-up. &quot;Getting
<br>
atheists to join a group is kind of like trying to herd cats. They're
<br>
typically individualists, suspicious of any organized group.&quot;
<br>
<p>O'Dell and Floyd both define atheism as the lack of belief in the
<br>
supernatural. &quot;It is a mechanical doctrine,&quot; O'Dell explains, which affirms
<br>
a faith in the rational mind and in the methods of science. &quot;God,&quot; on the
<br>
other hand, &quot;is Santa Claus for adults.&quot;
<br>
<p>Free thinkers, in contrast may believe in God but arrive there &quot;on their own
<br>
merit and wit&quot; rather than through acceptance of an authority, like the
<br>
Bible.
<br>
<p>Both men embrace a universally applied, humanist ethical code.
<br>
<p>Floyd equates it to the Golden Rule. They are avid believers in the
<br>
separation of church and state and, says Floyd, in &quot;doing what we can to
<br>
improve the lot of everyone.&quot;
<br>
<p>But O'Dell and Floyd do not envision a typical political action group.
<br>
O'Dell foresees meetings as social and educational events, featuring
<br>
discussions on science, philosophy, and the great books - &quot;like Plato and
<br>
his weird beliefs.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Mainly,&quot; Floyd says, &quot;we're trying to get a group of fellow skeptics,
<br>
non-believers, and freethinkers together to have fun, learn about things,
<br>
learn about each other. Whatever people want to do - go bowling, go to the
<br>
theater together. It's to get people used to the fact that it's okay not to
<br>
believe, and to meet others like themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>Floyd, a computer programmer with a background in chemical engineering, was
<br>
raised a Catholic but experienced &quot;an erosion of belief over time. I can't
<br>
put my finger on when I came to the conclusion I was an atheist. I just grew
<br>
to disbelieve.&quot;
<br>
<p>Says O'Dell, &quot;I've always been an atheist,&quot; but, after his boyhood in Texas
<br>
under the stern eye of a Baptist father, &quot;going to church was one of the
<br>
main reasons I stayed an atheist. Church is boring! I got a grudge against
<br>
it, having to go all the time or it's time for a spanking.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the motivation to become an activist didn't strike until college in
<br>
Denver, CO, two years ago, &quot;when Kansas took evolution completely out of the
<br>
schools and replaced it with religion. That got me really stirred up.&quot;
<br>
Agitating him further was proposed legislation in Colorado requiring the
<br>
posting of the Ten Commandments and a mandatory moment of silence in public
<br>
school classrooms. He looked for solidarity with other atheists but, to his
<br>
surprise, found none. So he posted notices announcing the formation of
<br>
Atheists of Denver. That group, he says, now has 180 members with 40 or 50
<br>
attending meetings regularly.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, his dream for an atheist broadcasting system has already been
<br>
born - www.freethoughtradio.com, streamed over the internet 24/7 from
<br>
Virginia Beach with a variety of information, opinion, and entertainment
<br>
&quot;for secular thinkers.&quot;
<br>
<p>Freethought Radio now has 500 listeners a day, he says, when &quot;six months ago
<br>
it was just an idea.&quot; He and Don Souza, a beach musician, collaborated
<br>
between here and Denver to found the station last July. Once &quot;we'd put
<br>
everything together, we thought it would work better if I moved here.&quot;
<br>
<p>But, he adds, &quot;I was a little disappointed that there weren't any secular
<br>
groups here.&quot; He believes Freethinkers &amp; Atheists of Virginia, following his
<br>
Denver prototype, can fill that gap.
