<em>&gt; ouch.  maybe buy the end product instead.
</em><br>
<p>I think a used Millipore can be cheaper, especially if you yourself do the
<br>
maintenance. If you can limit yourself to small quantities, a constantly
<br>
running distiller (a glass shenanigan with a quartz heating rod) could be
<br>
substituted. You'd still want to use a sterile filter at the tap end. And,
<br>
think about electricity bill, and a trickle of an output. I would
<br>
recommend calling your local Millipore rep, and asking him for a quote on
<br>
a used setup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; b) -80 deg freezer: $3000-5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is this definitely necessary?  -15C won't do?
</em><br>
<p>Nope. In fact, sometimes you need -130 C, and you need LN cans for
<br>
longterm storage. Notice that lab freezers rack up ridiculous electricity
<br>
bills, and dissipate more heat than an oven, especially in the summer
<br>
(SoCal summer + garage + lab freezer = trouble). Of course, you could put
<br>
a stainless steel dewar with dry ice into a -15 C freezer, that will give
<br>
you a small pocket of ~-80 C, for a bargain price.  Especially, if you
<br>
pick up the dry ice blocks and crush them by yourself, and don't go for
<br>
the long term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; c) Sterilizer: $1000-$15000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alcohol won't do?
</em><br>
<p>No. Cold sterilization solutions are available, but what you need is a
<br>
small autoclave for the eppendorf caps and tips (don't forget the
<br>
sterilization indicator tape), and for solution flasks too, of course. you
<br>
can use a pressure cooker with a little water in it, and a raised platform
<br>
in it. Don't bother. Just buy a used desktop autoclave. They're quite
<br>
cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; d) Incubator: $2000-$5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 grand for a heater!?  are you serious?  any disadvantage in using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;use a lamp&quot; method i read somewhere on the net?
</em><br>
<p>Incubators do not only temperature, but also humidity and gases. You can
<br>
improvise here, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; e) Centrifuge(s): $1000-$7000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, i assume for isolating ribosomes, you'd want tens of thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RPMs, but just to separate DNA, what would be the minimum RPM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirement?  wouldn't a souped up fan spun for a long time do? (only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half kidding)
</em><br>
<p>If you're talking separation in CsCl gradient, that's an ultracentrifuge.
<br>
Uh, you don't want to go there. Something requiring a microbalance to
<br>
equilibrate the tubes, solid titanium rotors, oildiff evacuated *armored*
<br>
rotor chamber is not something you'd want to operate in your home, even if
<br>
you can get one for cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; f) PCR apparatus: $2000-$4000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the cheap side, i was thinking of using manpower: 95C tub, 60C tub,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 72C tub, move eppendorfs from one to the other when you think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropiate.  If this is too mindnumbing and feeling enterprising,  grab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lego mindstorms, get it to do it for you.
</em><br>
<p>Just drill a number of holes into an aluminum block, put it on a Peltier
<br>
and drive it by software.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; f) Microscope: $400+
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i suppose
</em><br>
<p>This one is cheap, but for serious work you'll need EM. Getting a used one
<br>
for cheap is easy, but you won't be able to maintain it by yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; g) Hood: $3000+
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, is it really necessary? (as opposed to, say, fan pointing out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; window)
</em><br>
<p>You have a problem there. You need to first learn what the gadgets are
<br>
there for, to realize which of the functionality can be sacrificed and
<br>
which can be replicated on the cheap. Luckily, it is very possible to
<br>
build a laminar flow bench DIY.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know it would be a very dodgy setup, but would it be good enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolate prokaryotic dna, cut it up and gel it? what about eukaryotic?
</em><br>
<p>DNA preps and digests are easy, assuming you have your enzymes (not very
<br>
cheap), and work cleanly (and autoclave all of your gear). Agarose gels
<br>
can be made in a microwave, and poured into a form.
<br>
<p>You can do a lot if you know what you're doing, and shop in used equipment
<br>
shops (UCSD has one, and there are others, but prepare for long and
<br>
relatively frequent drives when fishing for eqipment).
<br>
<p>To learn the basics it would seem to be best to spend some time as an
<br>
indentured slave in a molbio lab, doing grunt work. Notice that if you set
<br>
up a lab at home, you will be under official scrutiny of the feds,
<br>
including little unannounced visits (some of them with a search warrant).
<br>
<p>Assuming any of you are crazy enough to want to set up something like this
<br>
at home, I'm very ready to offer advice and ideas.
