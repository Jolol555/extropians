This is kind of intriguing. It looks like a decent micro microbiology setup
<br>
is on the same financial order as a good audio setup was a decade or two
<br>
ago. Also, I'd guess there are ways to squeeze the cost down (while likely
<br>
making rather severe compromises).
<br>
<p>Another whole world of geekdom I've never been aware of till now. &lt;Rubs
<br>
hands together&gt;
<br>
<p>Kind of puts into perspective fears about basement nanotech setups. It'll
<br>
happen, wont it?

<em>&gt; Seriously though, there are a number of ways to lower costs.  One is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are some hefty costs you are missing when you attempt to scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a simple microbiology lab to a molecular biology lab.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) Water purification: $3000-5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) -80 deg freezer: $3000-5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) Sterilizer: $1000-$15000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; d) Incubator: $2000-$5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e) Centrifuge(s): $1000-$7000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; f) PCR apparatus: $2000-$4000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; f) Microscope: $400+
</em><br>
<em>&gt; g) Hood: $3000+
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the high end prices are for more serious work.  But I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess for serious molecular biology work the minimum entry costs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are probably $30-40K. It would be interesting to see what the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;high school molecular biology lab&quot; might turn up some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The unfortunate part of this is that although I think things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lab-on-a-chip could decrease your operating scale and therefore lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental costs, I don't really see trends that will decrease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the minimum entry costs anytime soon.
