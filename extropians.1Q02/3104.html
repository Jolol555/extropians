</em><br>
<p>Qubit based technology seems to require cryogenic environments, whereas
<br>
computronium will be obviously limited to the &lt;1 kK temperature range
<br>
before you'll get into deterioration regime. Node cloud assemblies need to
<br>
be obviously small and sparse enough that you can get rid of that by
<br>
radiative transfer, which gives you a relativistic latency bound. What is
<br>
the optimal radial distribution of the node density, given above
<br>
constraints, anyone knows?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you have M kilograms of matter and use the fraction f to produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information, then if you end up with just enough matter to hold the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result you get: x(1-f)M=fM c^2/kTln2. The &quot;optimal&quot; f is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; T=3 K, I get f=3.2e-16. On the other hand, for x 10^50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (nuclear storage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; close to the Bekenstein bound) f~=1.  In the first case the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is so bad at storing information that you cannot use much of it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; energy, since you will run out of storage. In the second case you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cram a lot of info into it, so you don't need much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The breakpoint is at x=3.13e39 bit/kg, I guess around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; degenerate matter.
</em><br>
<p>We don't know if degenerate matter (gravitation-stabilized, I presume?
<br>
That would make it essentially a flat spherical assembly around a core
<br>
otherwise useless but for energy generation)  offers sufficient structural
<br>
variety to build computational machinery.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So it seems that we would expect that hot or high-density
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would want to gather as much matter as possible for storage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; while cool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilizations with lower memory density would rather burn their matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to power their computers. So given these assumptions the
</em><br>
<p>I think agoric/evolutionary systems are not so rational as a whole, and
<br>
would tend to try to run as fast as possible (co-evolution does select for
<br>
faster reflexes, and an order of magnitude slower human is not employable
<br>
even if he uses less energy, as long as energy is cheap). If we look at
<br>
our solar system, and just at the Sun's output, we'll see that there is a
<br>
surplus of matter over energy. Iirc Robert said that Mercury alone is
<br>
sufficient to intercept the entire solar output if disassembled in a high
<br>
enough orbit to be still useful for photovoltaics and computation. Mercury
<br>
represents a very small fraction of mass in the system, even if we
<br>
consider heavier elements.
<br>
<p>Once the Sun output is intercepted completely (would 2 MT of energy/s flux
<br>
be sufficient to fabricate and stabilize microsingularities?), and
<br>
utilized to the full, and we have surplus matter, pressure for lebensraum
<br>
would seem to create a demand for fusion outside. Speedup will be
<br>
1e5..1e6, but we might run out of energy sources but the Sun (assuming,
<br>
people won't start lifting matter from it) in a far shorter time period
<br>
than expected. Infrared luminosity of the system (lightdays to a
<br>
lightmonth) would seem to increase towards quite hight values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; really advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilisations using nuclear storage would likely want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imitate cosmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dark matter...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This stuff about &quot;really advanced civilisations&quot; (or individuals, or some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other concept), moving to an optimal limit of computation and staying there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has always gnawed at me as a flawed notion. I guess I can't accept that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most advanced beings in the universe would just accept a physical limitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that.
</em><br>
<p>Our physics is obviously impcomplete, and so far the universe has been
<br>
very favourable to us, but assuming that things will just get better and
<br>
better without further evidence is a bit too optimistic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think of &quot;optimal&quot; energy/matter ratio refered to above as &quot;cruising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed&quot;. Does it seem unlikely that there might be higher entropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives that allow qualitative improvements in computational ability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to cruising speed?
</em><br>
<p>I don't see what needs to be cruising, other than information. It might be
<br>
encoded in streams of relativistic pellets, but the carrier and transport
<br>
is negligable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that we must consider the motivation of these beings. Why do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want to sit at cruising speed, cognitively, until the universe finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissembles into total entropy? These are beings who, it must be supposed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have altered themselves *radically* to get to where they are; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservatives I think. Early adopters in a past life ? :-)
</em><br>
<p>These beings are many and diverse, and so is their agenda. Assuming
<br>
anything else would see to require postulating a sustained diversity loss,
<br>
or supression of radiation after passage through a diversity bottleneck
<br>
(first autofeedback seed). Do you have a mechanism for that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One must consider finally that the sole purpose of these entities is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think. Really, deeply think. Unless they get to a point where there is no
</em><br>
<p>Nope. A lot of them might be nonsentient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; more to think about, before they hit the limits of cruise speed, could these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entites possibly be satisfied stopping at what, to them, must seem an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely arbitrary point?
</em><br>
<p>Ecologies as a whole don't think an awful lot (even if containing
<br>
philosopher-king types), and do not like being controlled. They just are
<br>
homeostating there, more or less. (Never mind a few extinctions, it's
<br>
business as usual).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the lifetime of the universe begins to loom as a large concern to you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you would want to find a way out of the box. If burning the candle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at both ends could make a difference, if sacrificing quantity of computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for quality &quot;right now&quot; was possible, it would have to be done. If nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else, just for the chance to be all that you could be.
</em><br>
<p>We'll find out what to do shortly.
