</em><br>
<p>I may be incorrect on my previous argument that bin Laden's call
<br>
to jihad against all infidels is held by few and is not more
<br>
endemic.  I have been reading more about the differences between
<br>
Islam and Christianity lately.  It seems that in the former
<br>
saying &quot;Islamic fundamentalist&quot; is fairly redundant compared to
<br>
saying &quot;Christian fundamentalist&quot;. Christianity includes both
<br>
those who take scripture as being revealed truth and inerrant
<br>
and those who do not take that position.  Islam however is
<br>
centered around a much deeper belief that the Koran is literally
<br>
revealed truth, literally the Word of God and utterly
<br>
unquestionable along with many other &quot;sayings of Muhammad&quot;.  
<br>
There is far less &quot;wiggle room&quot;.  To wiggle much at all is to
<br>
risk death in a country ruled by Islamic law.  Many have died
<br>
for their criticisms of Islam.  I also ran across this quote
<br>
from Khomeini back around 1989 (around the Rushdie incident)
<br>
responding to Western aplogists and Muslim moderates that gives
<br>
me pause:
<br>
<p>&quot;	Islam makes it incombent on all adult males, provided they are
<br>
not disabled and incapacitated, to prepare themselves for the
<br>
conquest of [other] countries so that the writ of Islam is
<br>
obeyed in every country in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those who study Islamic Holy War will understand why Islam
<br>
wants to conquer the whole world....Those who know nothing of
<br>
Islam pretend that Islam counsels against war.  Those [who say
<br>
this] are witless.  Islam says: Kill all the unbelievers just as
<br>
they would kill you all!  Does this mean that Muslims should sit
<br>
back until they are devoured by [the unbelivers]?  Islam says:
<br>
Kill in the service of Allah those who may want to kill you! 
<br>
Does this mean that we should surrender to the enemy?  Islam
<br>
says: Whatever good that there is exists thanks to the sword and
<br>
in the shadow of the sword!  People cannot be made obedient
<br>
except with the sword!  The sword is the key to Paradise, which
<br>
can be opened only for Holy Warriors!  There are hundreds of
<br>
other [Koranic] psalms and Hadiths [sayings of the Prophet]
<br>
urging Muslims to value war and to fight.  Does all that mean
<br>
that Islam is a religion that prevents men from waging war?  I
<br>
spit upon those foolish souls who make such a claim.&quot;
<br>
<p>Remember the fattwa against Rushdie for blaspheming Islam and
<br>
its prophet.  Remember that that was taken very seriously by
<br>
Muslim and non-Muslim alike.  Remember also those in the West
<br>
who made apologetics for such and changed their behavior to not
<br>
offend Muslims and risk danger to themselves.  Relatively few
<br>
stood up for freedom of speech and of the press.  Even then we
<br>
believed that Muslims can be moved to very desperate means by
<br>
such calls and that the danger is very real.  
<br>
<p>I wish it were not so but there is in fact more than a little
<br>
reason to take these dangers of Muslim calls for jihad
<br>
seriously.
