</em><br>
<p>I've not read Pournelle's, but I have read Steve Stirling's (a guilty
<br>
pleasure of mine).
<br>
<p>The first and second books take place in this alternate world's version of
<br>
WWII and its aftermath. The third and fourth books actually deal somewhat
<br>
seriously with some of the themes of transhumanism.  By the third book,
<br>
the Draka have have conquered half the world, and remade it in their
<br>
image...a world in which the chattel slavery of the American South
<br>
embraces the industrial revolution; imagine Henry Ford able to buy his
<br>
workers on the auction block rather than having to pay them ever
<br>
escalating wages. 
<br>
<p>The Draka elite actually realize that they have painted themselves into a
<br>
corner.  Their model of society, while workable (barely) in a growing
<br>
heavy industrial society, cannot in the long run compete with with the
<br>
growing information economy of the West.  They must conquer the rest of
<br>
the world, while they still retain the capacity.  Furthermore, they
<br>
realize that they will always be threatened by their own slaves, and
<br>
politically divide into two factions over this.  One faction favors (after
<br>
the conquest allows them the luxury) a gradual liberalization, granting
<br>
more freedom to the slave class over time.  The other, whose work has
<br>
already begun with the birth of the first of the New Race, favor
<br>
genetically engineering the Master Race, and just as importantly the
<br>
engineering of a slave race designed to be dominated and like it.  They
<br>
hate and fear the liberals, and the liberals fear the the human race will
<br>
be engineered into termites. 
<br>
<p>It is an interesting depiction of essentially *choosing*, for non-rational
<br>
ideological reasons, the sort of society you want, and then going about 
<br>
engineering people to fit that preconception.  I suppose the commies would 
<br>
create Socialist Man, and the Nazi's something like the Draka.  What sort 
<br>
of people would libertarians create?
<br>
<p>No brave free normals defeat the Draka; they win.
<br>
<p>The fourth book is set about 400 years later (and on present day Earth,
<br>
our own alternate timeline), and depicts the engineered Final Society, as
<br>
well as the technologically advanced decendants of the the handful to
<br>
escape the conquest of the Earth in the first starship. The Draka focus on
<br>
biological technology, the Samothracians on computer technology and eschew
<br>
biotech (at least the permanent kind the Draka have).  There is handwaving
<br>
about how strong AI is impossible and how Moore's law plateus early to
<br>
keep the characters recognisably human.  There also are limits to the
<br>
genetic engineering of the Draka...a sort of Campbellian trade-off between
<br>
agressive domination and creativity. 
<br>
<p>In the interstellar cold war, the Samothracian's face an interesting
<br>
dilemma:  suppose they did eventually defeat the Draka...what do they do
<br>
with the slaves?  They are breed to be docile and obedient, but not
<br>
stupid.  They would just go about recreating their old masters, but how
<br>
can you justify exterminating them (the Samothracians are suppose to be
<br>
the good guys, after all).
<br>
<p>Not the greatest books in the world, and many have trouble suspending
<br>
disbelief (the Draka seem to get *all* the breaks, and the tech advances a
<br>
bit faster than believable so the Final War can take place at the close of
<br>
the Millenium), but an interesting challange to the notion that the good
<br>
guys always win, and a warning that the future can still turn out to be &quot;a
<br>
boot stomping on a human face, forever&quot;...particularly when techology can
<br>
be used to change the game completely.
