Here are some old posts by Robin on health care.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q98/0306.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q98/0306.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- Shows risk factors for death based on age, sex, race, residence,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;education, income, smoking, drinking, weight and activity.  Best
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for survival: stay young(!), be female, make &gt; $30K a year, avoid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNDERweight, and get lots of exercise.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q99/0061.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q99/0061.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- &quot;Amazingly enough, researchers have yet to measure a significant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggregate effect of medicine (doctors, etc.) on health.&quot;  Reports on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a 3 year study giving one group 1/3 more medical care than the rest,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with little benefit.  A study of Medicare patients &quot;found that any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mortality benefit of spending in the last six months of life is less
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a one part in a thousand.&quot;  We spend 14% of GDP on health care
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the U.S. with very little demonstrable benefit.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2131.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2131.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- &quot;The US polio death rate was ~1/500 of the total US death rate when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vaccine was introduced.&quot;  (Hence polio vaccine did not make a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;major contribution to longevity.) &quot;I'd guess that Medicine of all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forms probably contributes less than 1 year to that 40 year increase
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in lifespan.  Since sanitation also doesn't seem that important,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is a big puzzle why exactly lifespan has increased so.&quot;  Also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/EC496/Sources/sources.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/EC496/Sources/sources.html</a> which has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many links on the question &quot;How Much Does Medicine Help Health&quot;.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2256.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2256.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;- More pointers to references on the failure of health care and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sanitation improvements to explain the 3-fold drop in mortality
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the 20th century.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2526.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2526.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;- References a paper estimating about 5 years of lifespan improvement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to medicine.  Robin questions some of their logic and suggests
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that 2 years is a more realistic value.  Either way it is a small
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fraction of the total lifespan increase.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2893.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q00/2893.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;- Debunks the myth that most health care expenses occur in the final
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year of life.  Eliminating expensive high tech treatment at the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end of life is only estimated to save about 1% in total health care
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;costs.

<br>
&nbsp;- Part of a discussion on the absence of evidence in the third
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world that improving sanitation and access to medicine will improve
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health.  Includes pointers to several additional health care posts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Robin from 1Q00 in addition to the ones here.
