</em><br>
<p>I think John made some comments similar to this either offlist to me
<br>
or to the list.
<br>
<p>I'm going to stick a pin in the balloon.
<br>
<p>What is the bottom line?  People are prematurely dead.
<br>
People will not get to have their lives extended.  People
<br>
will not get to experience the singularity.  People will not
<br>
get to live in the era where one does not have to *struggle*
<br>
for survival (at least we hope).  People will not get to live
<br>
in the time where the greatest challenge one faces is what to
<br>
do with thousands of years of time in which one can explore many
<br>
subjects, quite deeply, and become acknowledged as a renaissance
<br>
person.  In short they have lost a huge opportunity.
<br>
<p>(I am assuming here that recovery or simulation technologies
<br>
can never recreate the &quot;real thing&quot; using a significantly
<br>
compressed information database.)
<br>
<p>Now, from an extropic perspective, I would argue we should seek
<br>
the &quot;greatest good&quot; -- the survival of the most individuals.
<br>
(One could also argue that one wants to promote the survival of
<br>
the &quot;best&quot; or most creative individuals -- but that gets into
<br>
some *extremely* subjective subject areas and potentially even
<br>
eugenics so I'm not going to go there.)
<br>
<p>I'll simply state for the purposes of this discussion that &quot;more&quot;
<br>
individuals are better than &quot;fewer&quot; individuals because it increases
<br>
complexity and that is extropian.  (Those of you reading this may
<br>
note some subtle frictions between extropianism and transhumanism
<br>
when considering whether trans- or post-humanism at least along some
<br>
paths is likely to generate the greatest complexity (extropicness),
<br>
i.e. you could have two &quot;post-human&quot; situations, equally &quot;complex&quot;,
<br>
one of which involves a large number of individuals and one of which
<br>
involves a single meta-mind.
<br>
<p>So, from a rational standpoint (given the above premises) the goal
<br>
should be to minimize premature death.  We all have finite resources
<br>
(time, money, etc.).  So the question becomes how to maximize
<br>
the minimization of premature death given our limited resources.
<br>
<p>IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THEY DIED -- WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT WE CAN DO
<br>
TO SAVE FUTURE DEATHS.
<br>
<p>Sure -- it is true -- we perceive actions by individuals that
<br>
cause deaths (proactive deathists) as more heinous than a lack
<br>
of action that causes deaths (passive deathists) which are
<br>
worse than &quot;natural&quot; deaths (the underlying natural hazard
<br>
function -- ranging from heart disease &amp; cancer to earthquakes
<br>
and asteroid impacts).  *But*, feeling my ears grow into sharpened
<br>
points, *is* that logical?
<br>
<p>Are not these distinctions &quot;artificial&quot;?  Aren't they driven
<br>
by genetic programming in humans?  {e.g. Identify your enemies
<br>
and eliminate them before they eliminate you.  From a reductionist
<br>
perspective (and those of you with narrow minds can nail me to
<br>
the cross, I'll willingly lie down on it) the males are attempting
<br>
to identify and eliminate the next Alpha male and the females are
<br>
attempting to eliminate those who would compete for access to
<br>
&quot;their&quot; Alpha male.  Bearing in mind that our society is complex
<br>
enough that the entire concept of &quot;Alpha&quot; male is quite subjective.}
<br>
<p>Taking the discussion back to a forum most of us are familiar with
<br>
(Star Trek) -- we must ask whether the Klingon philosophy has
<br>
merit.  Is there ever a day when perhaps &quot;it IS a good day to die&quot;?
<br>
<p>If the answer is yes, then we cannot fault recent attempts
<br>
at creating &quot;good days to die&quot; (other than to object to the fact
<br>
that &quot;we&quot; (Westerners) were the ones dying.   If the answer is no, then
<br>
we have to make the case that living and surviving is of much greater
<br>
value than (a) the &quot;stories&quot; of ones life (e.g. the Klingon perspective)
<br>
or (b) what one has contributed during ones life (a somewhat human
<br>
perspective considering contributions of Einstein, Feynman, Darwin,
<br>
etc.) [I think this translates into the concept that after one
<br>
ceases to make &quot;significant&quot; contributions, ones life is devalued.]
<br>
{ Side-bar: This may be a quite interesting concept as it involves
<br>
the concept of the depreciation of human lives.  I know some (the
<br>
humanist gaggle) might object to this but from an extropian perspective
<br>
it may have merit -- if you aren't &quot;contributing&quot; to the society
<br>
what rights do you have to &quot;occupy&quot; a place in it. }
<br>
(You know -- survival of the fittest and all that...)
<br>
<p>Returning to the issue -- how does one prevent premature deaths
<br>
at the lowest cost?  I am asserting that *IT DOES NOT MATTER*
<br>
what caused those deaths.  What matters is the relative costs
<br>
of reducing such deaths.  Taking an alternate position means
<br>
one must argue the relative &quot;acceptability&quot; of deaths.  E.g. *These*
<br>
deaths are bad and should be prevented while *those* deaths, well,
<br>
they are not so important and we will choose to ignore them.
<br>
<p>So to maximize the extropic vector, extropians should be asking
<br>
the question &quot;How do I save the most lives at the lowest cost?&quot;.
<br>
(Or alternatively, stepping deeply into the swamp, make the
<br>
case that some lives are more valuable than others -- and
<br>
suggest policies that promote saving those &quot;specific&quot; lives.)
<br>
<p>I will go on record here (and probably be crucified for it)
<br>
that I do believe that some lives are inherently more valuable
<br>
than others.  There *are* some lives that *will* save more lives
<br>
than they destroy (e.g. Winston Churchill vs. Josef Stalin).
<br>
But I also question whether it is possible to identify the lives
<br>
with greatest value in advance with sufficient certainty to be
<br>
&quot;picking&quot; them.  So one is rolling dice when one attempts to
<br>
follow this path.
<br>
<p>But, *if* one can come up with reasonable statistical measures
<br>
that suggest that some political paths or leaders will save more lives
<br>
than they eliminate -- then I would argue that in such situations
<br>
that militant actions, even terrorism, in support of such paths
<br>
are potentially justified.
<br>
<p>In response to my arguments that early on, American revolutionaries
<br>
were &quot;terrorists&quot;, some have claimed that they only assaulted
<br>
(in relative terms) &quot;military&quot; targets.  In response, particularly
<br>
to those arguing the fine points of the Geneva Convention, I must
<br>
propose -- if one feels one will never &quot;triumph&quot; without taking
<br>
the &quot;pain &amp; suffering&quot; to the general population opposing your
<br>
position -- is not the use of such tactics justified?
<br>
<p>Barbara Steisand, in Yentl, sang a song &quot;Papa, can you hear me?&quot;.
<br>
<p>It would appear to me that this question is one that must be answered
<br>
definitively in the west -- we must answer both those people currently
<br>
disenfranchised as well as those who might someday be (from the Fukuyama
<br>
posthumanist perspective).
<br>
<p>It seems necessary that we remain aware of the need to maintain
<br>
a dialog.  Once people have concluded &quot;they are not heard&quot;, it is but
<br>
a small step to ignore any &quot;civilized&quot; protocols as to how &quot;conversations&quot;
<br>
should be conducted.
<br>
<p>With regard to the prevention of premature deaths it becomes a
<br>
question of whether listening (and responding) is less costly
<br>
(from an extropic perspctive of preventing premature deaths)
<br>
than proceeding on our along previous paths that assumed we were
<br>
relatively secure.  Another way of looking at this is -- will
<br>
each $ spent on &quot;Homeland Security&quot; save more or less lives
<br>
than each $ given to the NIH (or the DoD, or the NSF, etc.).
<br>
(The same discussion applies to other countries as well.)
<br>
<p>How *do* you save the most lives at the lowest cost?
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>(I know some reading this post may find it stretching into a
<br>
number of different areas (byegones), please keep the subject
<br>
title for the central topics -- premature death prevention or
<br>
equivalence of premature deaths -- if you want to comment
<br>
on some of my divergences a different subject title may
<br>
be appropriate).
