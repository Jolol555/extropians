<p>
Rather than sit back and point fingers of scorn at the deaf community from
<br>
our superior position, as Mike seems to be doing, I was hoping that we
<br>
could see this conflict as a precursor to the greater battles ahead.
<br>
<p>Recall Clarke's novel Childhood's End.  Suddenly all children begin to be
<br>
born with tremendous mental powers, able to manipulate matter at will,
<br>
communicate with others and form into a global and in fact galactic
<br>
super-mind.  But their parents are utterly unable to communicate with
<br>
them at all.  From their parents' perspective, their children are lost.
<br>
They may take intellectual comfort in knowing that their children have
<br>
achieved greatness beyond imagining.  But it is cold comfort because
<br>
the changes are so great that the children are practically non-human.
<br>
In effect the children have become aliens, and all connection to the
<br>
parents is lost.
<br>
<p>Who can doubt that if the parents' consent had been needed for this
<br>
change, few would have agreed to go along?  How many of us would turn our
<br>
children into aliens, separate and forever apart from us, simply in the
<br>
intellectual belief that they would be achieving greater powers?  Well,
<br>
hopefully among Extropians we would be willing to consider doing so.
<br>
But those of us who have actually raised children will appreciate how
<br>
difficult it would be to take this leap of faith.
<br>
<p>For Mike and his fellow conservative ideologues, consider an intelligence
<br>
enhancement for your children which has an observed side effect: almost
<br>
all of them become Socialists.  Quel horreur!  It's not implausible: in
<br>
fact in many of the most difficult and esoteric branches of science and
<br>
mathematics, branches which require the highest levels of sheer abstract
<br>
intelligence to thrive, Socialism and allied political philosophies
<br>
are widespread.  I remember reading an obituary in The Mathematical
<br>
Intelligencer which went to some length to apologize for the fact that
<br>
the deceased was not a Socialist.  He was still a decent guy, the obit
<br>
hastened to explain, he just had this one little political blind spot.
<br>
<p>So you can make your kid a genius, but it will take him from the political
<br>
philosophy you have embraced all your life.  He will have nothing but
<br>
contempt for your political views.  He will be lost to your political
<br>
culture.  Yet you will be giving him great powers for advancement and
<br>
achievement in life.
<br>
<p>In this situation, is it so easy to see that enhancing your child is
<br>
automatically the right thing to do?  How do you like MIKE'S PROPOSAL
<br>
that society FORCE you to enhance the child?
<br>
<p>Hopefully as Extropians we have the courage and the faith to give our
<br>
children these advantages even at cost to ourselves and our link to them.
<br>
But clearly for most people this will be an even more difficult decision.
<br>
If transhuman technologies are most easily applied to children, which
<br>
is plausible due to their greater neural plasticity (which is why the
<br>
cochlear implants only work on them), then we may all find ourselves in
<br>
the position of the deaf for whom Mike shows such scorn.
<br>
