From: &quot;Phil Osborn&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:philosborn@altavista.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Quest%20for%20the%20Purpose%20of%20Life">philosborn@altavista.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is so-oo depressing.  Like, how many times do we have to keep
</em><br>
re-inventing the wheel?
<br>
<p>Amen.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ayn Rand covered this topic rather well, I thought, and I would have
</em><br>
assumed that as astute a group as extropians would surely have absorbed at
<br>
least the basics of Rand's thought with their mother's milk.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read anything yet, but since she seems to be referenced often in
<br>
this community and others, her books are on my wishlist now. From my
<br>
observations it seems that her writings about objectivism are literally
<br>
essential reading for Extropians?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Briefly, the question &quot;what is the purpose of life,&quot; contains an error of
</em><br>
category.  Things only HAVE purposes TO living entities.  Purpose to WHOM
<br>
and FOR WHAT????  Purpose only has meaning with regard to a living entity.
<br>
To ask then - what is the purpose of LIFE? - is meaningless.  LIFE creates
<br>
and identifies purposes.  (This does not mean, however, that all purposes
<br>
are equally valid.  Life itself - and each living entity - has a specific
<br>
identity.)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I also see at least three levels of &quot;whom&quot; we are talking about - your own
<br>
self, the community (Extropians in particular), and humanity as a whole. If
<br>
the self chooses to identify with a community such as Extropians,
<br>
Christians, atheists, lawyers, etc. then by definition they are abiding by
<br>
the principles that define the community. For Extropians it should be the
<br>
Extropian Principles as laid out in <a href="http://extropy.org/ideas/principles.html">http://extropy.org/ideas/principles.html</a>
<br>
. It is to fulfill these principles that the Extropian individual &quot;gets up
<br>
in the morning&quot; (or colloquially speaking, &quot;get a life!&quot;), so that the
<br>
Extropian community can exist and evolve with &quot;life&quot;, and through these well
<br>
thought out principles this community hopes to positively affect humanity's
<br>
&quot;life&quot; so that it can exist and evolve.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; It is the lack of precision in terms such as &quot;life,&quot; &quot;process,&quot; &quot;action,&quot;
</em><br>
&quot;value,&quot; &quot;purpose,&quot; &quot;moral,&quot; &quot;ethical,&quot; and a host of similar or related
<br>
concepts (and include &quot;concept,&quot; or course) which enables these endless
<br>
meandering, largely purposeless opinionfests.  Rand by no means completed
<br>
the job of clarification of these issues, but I suggest that those who are
<br>
seriously interested in discovering useful knowledge take a look at what she
<br>
did accomplish.  It can really help clear out some of the fog.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And it is this ambiguity inherent in the English language that concerns me.
<br>
Natural languages are hard enough to use for &quot;native&quot; users, and harder to
<br>
comprehend with incorrect grammar, spelling, unreadable fonts, bad line
<br>
spacing and formatting, etc. Humans are so text oriented in this day and
<br>
age, and these terms you listed are just a small set of examples that will
<br>
continue to cause confusion and people to continually ask these
<br>
categorically incorrect questions. Text is great, and having the ability to
<br>
read is practically essential in modern living, almost as much as being able
<br>
to speak. I have a dream that in the future we will have more deterministic
<br>
ways of communicating with each other, say with sight-oriented static
<br>
pictures and animated pictures, or audio-oriented speech and music, or
<br>
kinesthetic-oriented touchy-feely stuff (walk around with a lump of
<br>
play-doh!), and preferably a combination of all methods that involve the
<br>
current human senses that are contained in our brain's various cortexes. I
<br>
believe there is too much text, too much to read, too much to write for the
<br>
average brain to handle, and we need to evolve other sight-oriented
<br>
communication methods, such as pictures. But I digress, this is another
<br>
topic of conversation than I originally started with ...
<br>
<p><p><p>cheers,
<br>
