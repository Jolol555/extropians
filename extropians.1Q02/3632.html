<p>
I should clarify what I was using as a metric for determining &quot;evolutionary
<br>
distance&quot; between other creatures and humans. What I mean is how much more
<br>
evolution (or direct, technological intervention, as a substite) would be
<br>
needed to bring organism X up to the level of organism Y; eg, the work
<br>
needed to make a dog into a human equivalent.
<br>
<p>Clearly, from the perspective of an SI, it must be far easier to alter a dog
<br>
to become equivalent to a human in cognitive abilities (by giving it frontal
<br>
lobes?), than to alter a human to the same level that it has reached itself.
<br>
Dogs (mammals, generally) would share far more with humans, architecturally,
<br>
than we would imagine a human to share with an SI. Therefore, a dog is
<br>
closer to a human than a human is to an SI. 
<br>
<p>Watch your reasoning, when assigning rights based on ability. In the greater
<br>
context of transhumanism, this thinking gives SIs the right to treat us far
<br>
worse than we currently treat animals, unless you also take the position
<br>
that our current treatment of animals is wrong.

<p><em>&gt; &gt;Maybe I should rephrase my statement here... in terms of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transformation, of which humans and dogs are both part, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;natural selection, and in the future probably including more direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intervention, the dog is not so far from us after all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolutionarily, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;far from dumb dog to sentient dog? Does that make an ethical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;an SI? Should it make a difference to us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Emlyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are correct in that humans are not very far from dogs.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have no &quot;ethical&quot; impact on an SI - it might however 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a practical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact since humans can be distinguished from animals based on their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity (if seldom utilized) of conceptual reasoning and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagination.  This distinction is why we also should not care 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about animal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights.  (Note: I do not advocate treating animals &quot;cruelly&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since I do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in engaging in any pointless behavior.)
