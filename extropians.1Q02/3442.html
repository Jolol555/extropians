</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;One could argue that the virtual nation is (c). The only way, IMHO, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;change society via (c) is to amass enough economic clout to make existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;portions of society listen. Anything else is wishful thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that a VN might help c).  See my response to Samantha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere.  However, I am no longer interested in changing society on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large scale per se until I have the technology to do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *directly* :-}  But  a VN (or VC for virtual community) *might* be a way
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; change one's *personal* society and survival prospects.  And you're right
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; economic  clout is a prerequisite (along with technology) to having any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect at all  on society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you read Hakim Bey's (Peter Lamborn Wilson) &quot;T.A.Z.&quot; (Temporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Autonomous Zones)?  Based on Situationist concepts from the 1960's on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;derive&quot; and &quot;permanent party&quot;, it's a concept of forming free zones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are temporary and mobile.  I thought Bey was not convinced of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Net being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any real use in implementing the concept, but that was before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer-to-peer and MMORPGs which might change his mind.
</em><br>
<p>I can see this sort of thing being the next logical step after VNs are
<br>
accepted and evolving. Some may do well enough to be able to establish
<br>
enclaves in meatspace for whatever reasons they need to do this; i.e.
<br>
renting land from real nations or other concerns. This can be a free flowing
<br>
affair or more static.
<br>
<p>I would anticipate a parallel between the evolution of VNs and the evolution
<br>
of e-commerce businesses -- i.e. you have this first flurry of VNs, which
<br>
mostly fail, and then a fusion and cross-pollination between VNs and real
<br>
nations. (Bricks vrs clicks). A VN backed by a real nation would probably do
<br>
far better on the average. But there's still the opportunity for a VN
<br>
equivelant to Ebay or Amazon to spring up and do well enough to dicate terms
<br>
with real nations or do without their cooperation entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do agree with you that 300,000 is definitely a community - even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10,000 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.  I used to moderate a conference on the WELL in the 1980's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will tell you that the WELL is a community.  The question is:  Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you constrain the *kind* of community you build with game rules while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *still* reflecting the real world enough to build a *real* community?
</em><br>
<p>The answer is yes. Go look at what is going on now in EQ and other MMORPG
<br>
guilds. Or FPS clans. There are free-roving communities that move between
<br>
proto-VNs even, just to add another level of complexity to the culture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem with the game notion being a basis for a VN, as I said to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, is that the people are there to *play a game* - not to build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtual world that reflects or interacts with the real world.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have  a group of people in place.  But the more they reflect the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, the  more your game world will reflect the real world.  Not good if
</em><br>
you intend
<br>
<em>&gt; to build some sort of lib community.
</em><br>
<p>And there's nothing wrong with any of this. People can be there just to play
<br>
a game and will still found a community if you pass the critical mass of
<br>
players. One of the points of the original post was that the motivation of
<br>
turning up to play a game seems to be the only successful method for
<br>
establishing online communities. This goes right back to text MUD days -- I
<br>
played BatMud in Finland during the Zonni era, and that was very definately
<br>
a community. Only a few thousand players, if that, but with a vibrant
<br>
history and ongoing community. Very similar to EQ in the way it crudely
<br>
simulates economic life in the real world too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I would note that EQ can be a &quot;stupid addictive mind-fuck game&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;being everything I say it is. &quot;stupid addictive mind-fuck game&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;describes most people's experience with their meat lives too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Productive is as productive does. Any successful/skilled EQ player can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;convert their EQ work time (i.e. time spent accumulating platinum, items,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;leveling, etc) to meat world money quite efficiently, thank you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thanks to black markets. There are real world groups that make a living
</em><br>
doing just
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this; one of them is sueing the makers of Dark Age of Camelot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now to prevent them banning such trades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please detail how the Everquest people are engaging in black-market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade.  I'm very interested in this cross-over.
</em><br>
<p>I think this spans some of the ways:
<br>
<p><a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;Sort">http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;Sort</a><br>
Property=MetaEndSort&amp;query=everquest
<br>
<p>Most seem &quot;legal&quot; in that they're guides or training -- with that cute get
<br>
rich quick language thrown in free of charge. However, some are selling
<br>
intangibles (platinum), which isn't. They'll probably be cancelled by eBay
<br>
staff.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.camelotexchange.com/DAOC.asp">http://www.camelotexchange.com/DAOC.asp</a>
<br>
<p>Camelot Exchange is a bunch of guys who sell their fruits of their labors in
<br>
a couple of games. They can't do this in EQ, because Verant would kick their
<br>
accounts (=exile them) / take other action against them in the real world.
<br>
<p>And of course, for everything you can find written down, there were no doubt
<br>
a bunch of unwritten trades conducted via the games or via contacts made
<br>
through the games.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The thesis of my post was that people can pontificate and design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bootstrapped virtual worlds all they like, and they'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roundly ignored as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they have been for decades. They're ignoring the herd of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elephants (virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;proto-nations based on games) next door. MMORPGs will spawn real virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nations; it seems all but inevitable at this point. The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question will be which direction will they head in?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is precisely my concern.  I would suggest that there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be multiple VNs heading in all directions - just like the real world.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting  issues are:  will they come into conflict?  How?  Will the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer network protocols they run on keep them separate despite
</em><br>
cross-overs of
<br>
<em>&gt; people from  one to another - or hackers?  And will a proliferation of VNs
</em><br>
make it
<br>
<em>&gt; easier to select your own desirable community?  Will the old lib
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;proprietary community&quot; notion be realized here?
</em><br>
<p>Possibly all of the above, and none of it is bad. People do what people do,
<br>
and a vibrant VN ecology should have all of the above, I imagine.
<br>
<p>Another of the points to my original post was that this is all about the
<br>
creation of new space in which to live your life and found/find a new set of
<br>
governing laws more suited to yourself. VNs seem easier, way cheaper and far
<br>
more underway than building islands or getting offplanet. EQ cost less than
<br>
$1,000,000 to get going, as did DAOC.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.  But you have to allow a lot of freedom, at least as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as in the real-world, to have a true virtual society/world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; evolve.  You need a set of basic &quot;physical&quot; laws and a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints on the inhabitants.  You also need that world to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; taken seriously and have serious potential for real gain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; loss and the creation of real value.  It needs more than to just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; be &quot;fun&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No you don't, no it doesn't. People build complex communities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with intricate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rituals, histories and mores on FPS shooter servers, you know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let alone in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;MMORPGs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's true - but I'm not interested in wasting my precious survival time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like they are on pointless pursuits.  There has to be a real-world benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or why bother?
</em><br>
<p>The real world benefit is economic in some way shape or form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the 1970's, I played one of the first &quot;Shoot Down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Airplane&quot; games on an Altair (or maybe it was a Processor Tech) -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two hours on that and, realizing that games are an addicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste of time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swore never to do it again.  I have played a couple games when I owned an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atari 520 ST, and I'm very impressed with the current crop of games which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more like movies than games - but that just means I'd waste even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time on them :-}
</em><br>
<p>If you develop skill in something, you can always try to capitalize on that
<br>
skill. This happens in FPS games (tournaments for money), MMORPGs (black
<br>
market trading of intangibles), etc, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, how about SEX?  As I mentioned to Samantha, a VN built
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around a &quot;Virtual Sex-World&quot; would attract a LOT of people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably be enormously profitable...
</em><br>
<p>True enough. I'm sure that will happen -- the pornographers are always on
<br>
the forefront of the tech curve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I'd suggest you bite the bullet and dive in and play some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these games for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a little while. Do some research. If you think that people don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;game worlds seriously, that the level of rules and laws are inconsistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with real societies, then you definately need to go look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess I'll have to do some research, since the notion intrigues me as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means of revenue generation [I'm on Welfare at the moment :-}]
</em><br>
<p>Like everything else, it's a job. Which means you have to take time to get
<br>
good at it before you have any hope of making money. As it currently stands,
<br>
the per-hour compensation is not all that.
<br>
<p>Have a look at the journals of fist de yuma:
<br>
<a href="http://www.crackednuts.net/asheron/index.php3?journal=3">http://www.crackednuts.net/asheron/index.php3?journal=3</a>. Gives you some idea
<br>
on the immersive culture of Asheron's Call, another older MMORPG, and the
<br>
issues that players consider important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You get whatever the virtual nation can muscle out of existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;simply having stuff to trade. Dual citizenship, preferential treatment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;access to money markets. Like being an ex-pat. As soon as sufficient flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;across borders exists, money changers spring up. So get paid in virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;currency, avoid real nation income taxes, use money changers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I can see income taxes being the first line of battle, actually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a significant body of people productively working in a virtual nation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not paying much in the way of income taxes to the real nation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to put noses out of joint.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't expect a VN to really be able to muscle any serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concessions out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of real states - they'll go to war first.  You have to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threaten  the real state in the real world with real technology.  Remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - the real states have real guns and those guns work without computers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, real personal benefits such as tax evasion could accrue in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical world, I agree.
</em><br>
<p>A good rule of thumb would seem to be that if
<br>
state/organization/conglomerate A has a higher net worth than B, it can get
<br>
concessions and deals out of B. As in business, as in life. Look at 1st
<br>
world corporate dealings in 3rd world countries.
<br>
<p>If we accept that EQ has a bigger economy than some countries right now
<br>
(yes, yes, I know it's flawed, but for the sake of argument), then if a
<br>
comparable game/virtual nation goes an talks to, say, Bulgaria, it may be
<br>
able to sort out trade agreements with that low-GDP country.
<br>
<p>War is an economic thing too. If it costs less to come to an agreement, then
<br>
agreement will be come to. Macroeconomics and geopolitics are fairly
<br>
rational in that respect. So the trick for a VN is to cut deals and offer
<br>
opportunities that cost countries less than trying to stamp out a VN --
<br>
which would involve stamping on a large number of their own citizens.
<br>
<p>I'd view the concessions and deals to aim at being: 1) recognition, 2) tax
<br>
issues, 3) dual citizenship for citizens, 4) standard exchange rate
<br>
machinations, 5) recognized access to capital markets. None of these are
<br>
really going to be a major economic problem for the country in question. If
<br>
the country already has Xk VN citizens who are not contributing to its GDP,
<br>
it may as well capitalize on them by granting the rights above.
