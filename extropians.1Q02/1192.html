Hi!
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A recent article in the journal Nature reported mice that had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mutation that reduced cancer but also substantially (20%) reduced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their lifespan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Duane -- don't you mean &quot;increased&quot; their lifespan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you don't cite specific sources it is difficult to verify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the message.
</em><br>
<p>Duane probably means this paper:
<br>
Tyner et al. (2002). &quot;p53 mutant mice that display early ageing-associated
<br>
phenotypes.&quot; Nature 415(6867):45-53. 
<br>
<p>If he does, then it's reduced life span. What was relevant was that
<br>
alongside the reduced life span were several signs of accelerated aging. If
<br>
you remember the p66 KO mice that lived longer you think how everything
<br>
makes sense. p53 increases apoptosis and when you increase p53 -- as
<br>
indirectly happens in this paper --, you get faster aging mice. When you
<br>
disrupt p66 -- also involved in apoptotic pathways, although no one knows
<br>
exactly how --, you get delayed aging and increased life span. I should
<br>
point that when you work with mice -- I don't but I heard about it --, you
<br>
notice that genomic misregulation is high, apoptosis is very high too and,
<br>
presumably, this is a burden for the metabolism. So, it makes some sense
<br>
that less apoptosis means higher longevity and vice-sersa. Finally, if you
<br>
don't know, knocking out p53 produces mice with very high cancer rates that
<br>
die quickly -- due to cancer, of course. (Presumably shows that there is a
<br>
threshold on how much you can lower apoptosis.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This gives further evidence that a fine balance needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to be maintained between these two processes for any serious attempts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at life extension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is (at least to me) obvious.  Mammals started out as very small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creatures.  As they get larger there is an increasing need to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to deal with cancer (which is a defective program of a single cell).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Humans have a very good anti-cancer program but it is much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capable than that which must exist in elephants and whales.
</em><br>
<p>True but it doesn't mean cancer and aging are related. Remember that mice
<br>
have lots of cancer and lots of genetic misregulation events but the same
<br>
doesn't happen in humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Obviously the genetic program degrades over time -- because there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are insufficient resources dedicated to preserving the genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program in a &quot;pristine&quot; state.  We have to wrestle with not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fact that the genetic program was not designed to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human bodies for 100+ years but that it is becoming corrupted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during that period.  We must solve *both* problems.
</em><br>
<p>Probably true from a statistical point of view. Yet even in very old
<br>
individuals I'm sure you can find perfectly preserved genomes in some cells
<br>
-- only these will probably be a lower proportion. You could also rephraze
<br>
that sentence: &quot;We have to wrestle with not only the fact that the genetic
<br>
program was not designed to maintain human bodies 100+ but that it isn't
<br>
designed to maintain itself 100+ years.&quot;
<br>
<p>Best wishes.
