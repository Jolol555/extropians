</em><br>
<p>Ultimately, I have always viewed substance abuse as I would view any 
<br>
disease: it is an affliction that can usually be cured, but the victim has 
<br>
to *want* to be cured before that can be done.  One difference between 
<br>
substance abuse and other diseases, however, is that where most diseases 
<br>
are primarily physical (even down to the molecular and chemical level), 
<br>
substance abuse is at least partially psychological as well.  Treatment 
<br>
can't be limited to *just* detox, nor can it be limited (in most cases) to 
<br>
*just* AA / NA etc.  It has to be a combination of the two.
<br>
<p>The point to this is that this duality of treatment is quite hard for most 
<br>
people to understand.  The common sentiment from most &quot;sober&quot; individuals 
<br>
is that the addicts simply &quot;don't want&quot; to help themselves, when really 
<br>
there is often another dimension to the issue.
<br>
<p>Education is *key* to solving a lot of the apparent &quot;drug problem&quot; that we 
<br>
currently experience.  The way it is generally done now is that drugs are 
<br>
automatically equated with all &quot;bad&quot; things, when really the educated 
<br>
should be more geared towards the reality that drugs are not inherently 
<br>
bad, but that the consequences of sustained drug use *can* be bad.  Kids 
<br>
are smart enough to know that a &quot;high&quot; doesn't feel bad.  But they lack the 
<br>
native intelligence/wisdom to understand the consequences of 
<br>
addiction.  That's something that can be changed, but to the best of my 
<br>
knowledge, too many people are painting a stark, black and white picture of 
<br>
an area that has a lot of inherent greys.
