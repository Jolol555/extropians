<p>Yes, Robert, and neither do I. I was speaking of that notion as a Big Lie,
<br>
and the consequent &quot;how to deal with useful idiots&quot; issue. I didn't mean to 
<br>
say that I thought the notion was a good one. &quot;Drexlerian&quot; is a cartoonish word, 
<br>
and it might have already caught on in some circles--I can't tell, I'm not privy.
<br>
<p>[important contradictions  to the cited bogus notion elided]

<p><em>&gt; &gt; probably by tacitly ignoring it when dealing with those with

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I meant &quot;appear to ignore it&quot;. Avoid mentioning the elephant at the breakfast table.
<br>
In this case, the elephant isn't Drexler or anything in his books, it's the bogus notion that
<br>
[&quot;Drexlerian&quot;==extreme==self-replicating assemblers-har-har-how-silly-end-of-story]... 
<br>
Along the lines of a tacit pleasant nod followed by ruthless intellectual honesty about 
<br>
the science that applies to a problem at hand, not mentioning how much of it is Eric's work--
<br>
let the other guy come to new conclusions re: Drexler (if ever) on his own schedule. 
<br>
<p>Don't defend Eric, end run the bigots and use them; that was the thrust of my thinking.
<br>
A sheaf of strategies is probably called for. I have a tendency to strident defense
<br>
of the unjustly-maligned; perhaps I was only coaching myself out loud for more diplomacy.
<br>
<p>There are sobering comparisons to be made. You probably got the last two references 
<br>
in my prior post, Robert, but to belabor it:
<br>
<p>Goddard eventually got a cheesy little contract to work on bazookas even though &quot;Goddardian&quot; 
<br>
was (virtually) a kiss of death. [Rockets can't work in a vacuum/Everyone knows 'space travel' 
<br>
is just _crazy_...(--pick any roughly analogous smear/lie)]. 
<br>
<p>Contrariwise, von Braun and the VfR were in the same time frame responsible for the creation 
<br>
and launch of _thousands_ of near-space vehicles--but they were weapons, aimed at London and Antwerp. 
<br>
<p>Hmmm. *MMB looks around for better alternatives than those two...*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Calculating the consequent risks &amp; goal drifts requires craft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Argue, or win the war?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Educate, avoid annoying people as best you can and prepare to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I was hyperfocusing on #2 of these three; and as I say, maybe mostly trying to 
<br>
remind myself to not gracelessly and aggressively react to those who use the word &quot;Drexlerian&quot; 
<br>
as a dismissive epithet. 
<br>
<p>Thanks for the (as always, thoughtful) reply.
