<em>&gt; &gt; But at what cost, Harvey? Because medical care costs money, every dollar

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What is money? Money is time, time out of a person's life spent laboring
<br>
away at something to earn a buck, half of which gets confiscated by the
<br>
tax man. If you are spending more money per hour of life at the end of
<br>
life than you earned per hour, then your net lifespan is shortening, not
<br>
lengthening. Time to put yourself on ice...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also believe that even small increments of lifespan let you live longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the future where better life-extending techniques will be available.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few measly years might let me reach some new longevity breakthrough.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather have a chance at immortality rather than saving a few bucks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Increased life span from health care is only cost effective when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cost of every hour of additional life is less than the average amortized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hourly wage of the individual. Only then is health care actually having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a positive impact on society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By whose calculation?  My life is worth much more than that!  :-)
</em><br>
<p>No, actually, it's not. Not when it comes to the economic arena and life
<br>
span.
<br>
<p>Now, wasting 90% of your wealth to lengthen your life one additional
<br>
year (wealth that takes, typically 30-50 years to accumulate) may be
<br>
your choice, and it's certainly better, relatively speaking, than
<br>
spending in on things which will shorten your life (smoking, drugs,
<br>
unprotected sex, etc etc etc), but it's still a waste when you have
<br>
cryonic suspension as an alternative to death. I'd rather blow my life
<br>
savings on a full body suspension job than spend the same amount on
<br>
geriatric care in my last years. The risk is slightly higher, but the
<br>
payoff is guaranteed to be far greater. After all, what does one year of
<br>
life as a bed ridden alheimers patient compare to living forever in a
<br>
young body?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, you can use those calculations to limit healthcare spending by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government for other people, if you want.  But personally, I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend lots of money on keeping me alive.  If I ever have a choice between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying and spending money, I'll spend the money.  I can't imagine ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping my money because life-extension is not cost-effective.  What good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will the extra money do me if I die early?
</em><br>
<p>Get suspended, of course.
