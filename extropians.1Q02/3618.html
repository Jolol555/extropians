</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Very. Remember that the human brain is unchanged since a very long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time. The reason why it seems so different now is it is full of very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sophisticated cultural products; those rely on the written word to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; develop. Oral tradition can only go so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And this is the real way I intended this link between writing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy. The idea is not that any person worth the name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;philosopher&quot; must have written many books. The idea is that you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get to a certain level of elaboration in thought if you don't live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society in which writing has been invented. We were talking about world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; view developpement in various societies, remember?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Our brain was not designed to do philosophy (nor science) as you may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realize. It was designed to be distracted, to react in real time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threats, etc. We manage to think more refined thoughts with the aid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that intellectual augmentation called writing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very interesting post. If what you say is correct (I personally think it is)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then what are the implications of the decline in the use of the printed word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the move to a more visual culture among the majority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population-which I think is happening in modern societies ? 
</em><br>
<p>If I understand well your post, then the first thing to note is, as
<br>
Mike said, that the decline of printing doesn't mean the decline of
<br>
writing. What matters most about writing, material or numeric, is, I
<br>
think, that it be stable, in the sense that you can get back to it.
<br>
<p>(This accomodates truth quite well, as truth itself is stable -- while
<br>
we are always changing, as are our circumstances.)
<br>
<p>Seen that way, it has increased, not decreased, recently. (In fact, I
<br>
am not aware that even printing alone has decreased.)
<br>
<p>By the way, while I think that Google is an opportunity for some
<br>
people (me included), and possibly for all society as a result of what
<br>
these people will make with the support of Google, I don't think it is
<br>
really what most people, individually, need. Most people already
<br>
suffer from too much alienating symbolic mediation, in fact they can
<br>
barely stand techné, that funky eschaton.
