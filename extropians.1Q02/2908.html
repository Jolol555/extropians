<p><em>&gt; The simple answer is no.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry Mitch but I have to *strongly* disagree with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is not one piece of evidence that such a nanobot does exist,
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but one has to ask what what level of &quot;proof&quot; would be
<br>
required that such nanobots do not exist.  To prove it demonstrably
<br>
in my mind, one would need to slice up the brains of every
<br>
individual on the planet at the 0.1-1 micron level and look
<br>
for signs of nanobots.  I don't see a high probability for people
<br>
rushing to sign up for this clinical trial.
<br>
<p>Paraphrasing Sagan, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nor does it appear likely, in the case of a &quot;ufo&quot; that memory munchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be actively, altering human neurochemicals, after a close encounter.
</em><br>
<p>This of course begs the issue -- why would &quot;aliens&quot; need to appear
<br>
as &quot;visible&quot; UFOs?  If they simply crawl around at the micron or
<br>
sub-micron level we are going to be hard pressed to notice them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First why have such a close encounter in the 1st place, and secondly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why even bother to go to the trouble of alteriing photographic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plates, for distant encounters?
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to agree.  If aliens exist as ubiquitous bacteria
<br>
(remember each human has ~40 trillion of these on or in their body),
<br>
then there is no reason that they need to create macro-scale phenomena
<br>
that humans would ever detect.  Think of this at the bacterial level --
<br>
I have a packet of 1 Mbit that I want to deliver (the packets could
<br>
be *much* more complex than that).  They are blown around by wind,
<br>
water currents, etc. until they are in a significantly different
<br>
location.  Every bacteria they come into contact with they exchange
<br>
&quot;send this East&quot; with &quot;send this West&quot; packets.  Simple random encounters
<br>
are going to result in a significant propagation of packets around the
<br>
globe.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Thus, one way to make our world is to do it in a computer simulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another would be to create a physical world and populate it with created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans.
</em><br>
<p>This may be a subtle point, I'm not sure.  But obviously there is a
<br>
transition point between whether one wants to run the &quot;reality&quot; in a
<br>
virtual world or the physical world.  It depends largely, I think, on
<br>
how soon one would like to see the results and the granularity of the
<br>
simulations (finer granularity presumably has greater needs to move
<br>
into the real &quot;reality&quot;) and perhaps on an economic analysis of how
<br>
much of the available energy in the universe do you use to run
<br>
the simulation in a VR vs. reality (if one is looking at optimizing
<br>
ones long term resources).  In the visible universe, little optimization
<br>
seems to be taking place, so we are either in the real reality or one
<br>
constructed to appear as if the optimization of resource utilization
<br>
is of no concern.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have read Dr. Bostrom's thesis several times, and still can't saavy why he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes the world is a simmulation.
</em><br>
<p>Its a numbers argument.  If &quot;perceived&quot; reality is a reflection of
<br>
&quot;real&quot; reality and in our &quot;real&quot; reality we can foresee the possibility
<br>
of running such simulations, then the odds are that we are one of
<br>
the simulations rather than the &quot;real&quot; reality (because the number
<br>
of simulations is much greater than the single reality).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is more data, as I state that there is, then we do not have a simm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but possibly a genuine, created universe; perhaps created Andrei Linde style.             
</em><br>
<p>But can you cite evidence that documents the amount of data that must
<br>
be out there vs. the amount of data that can generated either by
<br>
a mathematical algorithm (e.g. fractals) or random chaos theory
<br>
that could easily be produced in a sim?  And how does one differentiate
<br>
between the &quot;real&quot; data and the data generated &quot;on demand&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On another matter, your conference on Practical Cosmology, perhaps needs to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include something like Existential Cosmology, touching upon meaning, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain-relief, (at least!). I remember reading John Leslie's books (Professor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the U of Guelph) which covered this issue, a bit.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read Leslie's books, but don't see why &quot;Practical Cosmology&quot;
<br>
need include &quot;Existential Cosmology&quot;.  In practical cosmology, one might
<br>
ask what fraction of the dust Amara sees in the Universe is composed of
<br>
Hall Utility Foglets.  Existential Cosmology might ask whether or not
<br>
the Utility Foglets enjoy their existence drifting between stars.
<br>
<p>As I think was pointed out not too long ago in the discussion about
<br>
the &quot;purpose of life&quot;, Rand would classify this as a categorization
<br>
error.
