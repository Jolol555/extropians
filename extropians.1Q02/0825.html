...

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is almost the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposite of &quot;Friendly AI&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Friendly AI&quot; is figment of imagination, fortunately, and the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making AI anything other than purely intelligent is more dangerous than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely autonomous systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<p>An instinct is the tendency to behave in a particular manner under particular 
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p>It is, for now, a figment of imagination.  But an intelligence without 
<br>
instincts is impossible.  Actually, even a simple machine without basic 
<br>
instinct analogs is impossible.  A tool, say a screwdriver, probably doesn't 
<br>
have anything analogous, though one might consider the processed alloy's 
<br>
toughness to be an analog, that's a bit of a stretch.
<br>
<p>But an elevator has an instinct to home on a pressed &quot;elevator call&quot; button.  
<br>
Just because we can follow out the chain of causality doesn't mean that it 
<br>
isn't an instinct.  When machines become more intelligent, they need a larger 
<br>
number of instincts.  The intelligence comes in balancing between them and 
<br>
handling them in a flexible manner.  Consider a CPU with only one 
<br>
instruction.  No matter what the instruction it isn't very useful ... in most 
<br>
circumstances.  As you add more instructions the circumstances that it can 
<br>
handle increase.  Somewhere down near this level a decision is taken that 
<br>
will lead to evolution as a plant or as an animal (i.e., sessile or mobile).  
<br>
A flatworm may have all of it's instincts hardwired (it currently seems 
<br>
plausible).  Does a bee?  Dubious, but possible.  But a fish definitely has a 
<br>
more flexible way of relating to its instincts. (It also needs more brain 
<br>
power .. flexibility costs cpu cycles.) etc.
