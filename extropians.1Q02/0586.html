<p>There may be a misunderstanding. IMO, the possible uses of microchips were 
<br>
predictable at that time. At least more predictable than the direct 
<br>
benefits or the by-products of the moon flights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The president set an almost unbelievable goal. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes he fired their immaginations and as a result we received many

</em><br>
<p>Seen from today, you are right. And I totally agree. But I doubt that the 
<br>
enormous effects of the &quot;by-products&quot; were expected and calculated in 
<br>
advance. Economists usually don't calculate that way (soft factors, 
<br>
unexpected by-products, the effect of motivation on engineering and 
<br>
creativity, etc.). Economic factors were pushed out of the reasoning by 
<br>
things like national prestige (against the SU), strategic and military 
<br>
issues, etc.
<br>
<p>Now, what kind of project could possibly repeat this success? We would need 
<br>
something really challenging most of the planet (to join humanity). 
<br>
Something that could go wrong (no risk, no fun), but would end in a 
<br>
desaster for many of us if we'd do nothing (motivation). A problem which is 
<br>
simple to communicate (to make its necessity clear for everyone). And 
<br>
something that needs contributions from many scientific fields (we don't 
<br>
know where the best by-product will come from). Hm. Oh, and finally 
<br>
something that turns economists from money keepers into money spenders :-)
