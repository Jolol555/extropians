<em>&gt; The Post article stated that Antarctica is the only continent that is

<em>&gt; cooling.  As far as empirical data go the jury's in: in the last 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years average land surface temperatures have increased by about 1 degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fahrenheit.  The most advanced climatic models indicate an anthropogenic
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current models are wrong.
</em><br>
<p><p>After doing much research into the topic myself, I've basically come to the
<br>
conclusion that the 1 degree of movement in a century falls below the noise
<br>
floor and that nothing useful can be construed from it. Even if some of the
<br>
minor temperature increase is anthropogenic, it does not follow that people
<br>
are dramatically changing the climate.
<br>
<p>What IS annoying is that even working under the assumption that the climate
<br>
is warming slightly, the vast majority of the people yammering on about it
<br>
have not the slightest clue as to what the consequences of that assumption
<br>
actually are.  The problem is that there is a very vocal group of people who
<br>
fall into this latter category who want the world to conform to their
<br>
&quot;solution&quot;, which conveniently fulfills their political objectives but for
<br>
which their is a scientific disconnect with the assumption those solutions
<br>
are based upon.  Thanks, but no thanks; I don't feel like handing the reins
<br>
of the economy over to extreme ideologues with a demonstrated lack of
<br>
scientific integrity.  (Better the devil you know...)
<br>
<p>I think a lot of the backlash against global warming, particularly in more
<br>
educated circles (where I've seen a lot of it), is less an argument against
<br>
the premise of global warming than it is an argument against those that have
<br>
hijacked the issue and are using it to construe all sorts of idiotic
<br>
conclusions that conveniently fit their political ideologies.  I think it is
<br>
arguable many of the groups that have hijacked the issue could potentially
<br>
be more harmful to the future of the human race than global warming will
<br>
ever be.
