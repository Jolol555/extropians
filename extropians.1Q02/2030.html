<p>
Happy Birthday Max!,
<br>
<p>I just want to publicly congratulate you on having yet another Birthday! :)  I remember very fondly the time I got to speak with you at Extro-5.  Your wisdom and good heart really impressed me.  
<br>
<p>I'm betting Natasha knows how to throw a great Birthday party!!  Have a good time!
<br>
<p>If you happen to live long enough, these parties will just get more and more interesting over the years!!  Both in quality of party favors and guests of enduring friendship. 
<br>
<p>warmest wishes,
<br>
<p>John    
<br>
<p><p><p>I'd like to make a toast to Max More who has been a generous and 
<br>
welcoming contributor to our culture.
<br>
<p>I am amazed at how Max keeps his focus on the big transhumanist 
<br>
picture -- the long term, the never-ending desire to see transhumanity 
<br>
grow and prosper, and the immediate issues that face our culture 
<br>
and our world.  Not only has his instinctive intellection broadened 
<br>
the scope of what people deem as possible, he takes it a step further 
<br>
by shedding light on the many of the concerns and unanswered questions 
<br>
of those with whom he comes in contact.
<br>
<p>I hope that we all become wiser by knowing Max.  I hope we become 
<br>
more loving and compassionate people having met Max.  I hope that 
<br>
we become yet more critical and scrutinizing in our acceptance of 
<br>
facts and the world around us and give to one another our gifts of questioning and wonder.
<br>
<p>Now, &quot;[h]ere's to plain speaking and clear understanding&quot; (Bogart) --
<br>
<p>May your life be a life and a merry one!
<br>
<p>Happy Birthday!
<br>
<p>Natasha
