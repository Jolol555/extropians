<p>In _Look to Windward_ Banks says &quot;perfect [unbiased] AIs always
<br>
Sublime&quot;.  Lacking anything tying them to the universe they head
<br>
straight for godhood.  In real life, I suspect a perfect AI would just
<br>
sit there.

<p><em>&gt; results the designer intends.  There is a good argument to be made that a

<p>There is?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it might be perfectly valid to classify AI as either &quot;externally

</em><br>
<p>I was reading through someone's copy of GURPS Transhuman Space
<br>
yesterday.  Fun.  Had some useful terms: infomorphs for any digital mind
<br>
(did they get that from Egan?), ghosts (perfect and destructive upload)
<br>
shadows (cheap hack upload from nondestructive scanning).  At any rate,
<br>
it also distinguished between non-sapient AIs, low-sapient AIs, and
<br>
fully sapient AIs.  The boundaries weren't exactly clear, especially
<br>
between the latter two; the second might not be has &quot;humanly creative&quot;
<br>
as the third.  But it was suggested the first was capable of some
<br>
self-awareness, but lacking its own goals, or something.  A really smart
<br>
command shell, perhaps, vs. AIs capable of coming up with their own
<br>
tasks even while not executing an orders.  AIs capable of being bored,
<br>
perhaps.
<br>
<p>I don't really like the GURPS terms there, or even the conceptual
<br>
divisions -- non-sapient AIs would be &quot;not creative&quot;, but Hofstadter's
<br>
work is aimed at precisely 'non-sapient' (not self-directed) but
<br>
self-aware AIs which are highly creative in doing their assigned task.
<br>
But the attempt at a conceptual division was interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; wired into the general intelligence engine.  I can also imagine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political and legal fallout in a useless attempt to regulate specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities in this vein.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In GURPS it wasn't useless.  Ghosts can't legally have multiple copies
<br>
running, sapient AIs have various legal and maybe moral constraints and
<br>
inhibitions wired in; rogue AIs lacking those get whacked on sight.
