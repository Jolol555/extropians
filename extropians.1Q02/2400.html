Subject: Re: CLIMATE: Cooling, not warming...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It should always be a red flag when your ideological preferences are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alignment with your beliefs about an objective but controversial issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like global warming.  An ideology is a useful tool but a terrible master.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the interests of constructing an accurate view of the world, you must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be suspicious of easy and comfortable beliefs which conform with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences.
</em><br>
<p>Quite so, and the underlying assumptions should be questioned and re-examined always.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For a quick overview of the scientific consensus,
</em><br>
<p>Science is not at all democratic. The notion of 'scientific consensus' (which I often see associated with global warming claims)
<br>
cannot clothe the emperor. One Max Planck outvotes an infinitude of &quot;Lord Kelvins&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I recommend last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year's report on Climate Change Science by the National Research Council.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is available online at <a href="http://search.nap.edu/books/0309075742/html/">http://search.nap.edu/books/0309075742/html/</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The report is only 29 pages and begins with a 5 page summary.  Appendix B
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes biographies of the contributors which should put to rest any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contention that these are brainwashed government flunkies.
</em><br>
<p>Each of the individuals listed in this picture-perfect display of influence-
<br>
<a href="http://books.nap.edu/books/0309075742/html/29.html#pagetop">http://books.nap.edu/books/0309075742/html/29.html#pagetop</a>
<br>
is a State This or a National That, therefore the recipent of government largesse. One does not bite the hand that feeds them, thus
<br>
is the quest for truth -science- sullied by gunbarrel funding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  They are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact respected scientists with strong credentials,
</em><br>
<p>Credentials are 'authorized' testimonies of some past performance, whether in intellectual achievements, brown-nosing, plagarizing,
<br>
backstabbing, ladder-climbing, or any of the other common behaviors found in state-run universities. They do not provide any
<br>
guarrantee of current and future performance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; many of them members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences.
</em><br>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences does not exist- it is quite strictly a figment of the imagination. Therefore, its prestige is
<br>
precisely zero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is an excerpt from the summary, reviewing the earlier report by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):
</em><br>
<p>The  January 2002 issue of *Scientific American* has a most illuminating article [pp 62-65] by claimed IPCC (which also does not
<br>
exist) &quot;senior fellow&quot; Stephen Schneider. Mr. Schneider also makes the claim within his article &quot;Even the most credible
<br>
international assessment body, the [IPCC]...&quot;: an excellent illustration of the necessarily self-referential nature of such notions.
<br>
The author then asks &quot;Will temperatures in 2100 increase by 1.4 degrees Celsius or by 5.8? *without any consideration* of global
<br>
cooling, stability, technological advances, etc., etc. The conclusion is placed before the assumption. Later, a claim that Bayesian
<br>
probability is objective is entertained, as if risk assessment could be done external to the risk assessor- a thought absent the
<br>
body of a thinker. It gets worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentration accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community on this issue.  The stated degree of confidence in the IPCC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assesesment is higher today than it was 10, or even 5 years ago, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty remains because of (1) the level of natural variability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherent in the climate system on time scales of decades to centuries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) the questionable ability of models to accurately simulate natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variability on those long time scales, and (3) the degree of confidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be placed on reconstructions of global mean temperature over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past millennium based on proxy evidence.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my opinion, denying that human-caused global warming is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consensus of the scientific community is putting our heads in the sand.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't something like 20,000 &quot;members of the scientific community&quot; sign a petition arguing that global warming is a hoax? It could
<br>
just as easily turn out, ****one hundred years from now****, that the tiny additions humans made to the atmosphere had staved off an
<br>
ice age.
