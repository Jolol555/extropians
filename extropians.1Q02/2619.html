Hey Doug (Doug Skrecky (<a href="mailto:oberon@vcn.bc.ca?Subject=Re:%2056'th%20update%20on%20fly%20longevity%20experiments%20-">oberon@vcn.bc.ca</a>):
<br>
<p>I keep seeing these interesting postings re your fly experiments.  Do you have a complete report available somewhere?  Also, you keep mentioning viral load as a major factor and the use of elderberry juice.  
<br>
<p>So, is there a downside to using elderberry extract or juice for humans?  Or is it just the expense?  I chanced upon a year's supply of the extract for free a few month's back - nutrition store near to where I work apparently went out of business and just dumped boxes full of supplements, generally a few months out of date, but certainly still viable - and took a tablespoon per day during the early flu season.  I didn't catch a single cold!  After the holidays, I stopped taking the extract and shortly acquired that nasty 2 week bug that's been going around.  Just anecdotal of course - so, what is the state of research on elderberry as an anti-viral.  Should we all be taking it???
