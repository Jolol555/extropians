Whoa! Nothing like a little bit of iron to turn over the
<br>
foundations of astrophysics !

<p>SUN IS MOSTLY IRON, NOT HYDROGEN, PROFESSOR SAYS
<br>
<p>ROLLA, Mo. -- For years, scientists have assumed that the sun is an
<br>
enormous mass of hydrogen. But in a paper to be presented Thursday, Jan.
<br>
10, at the American Astronomical Society's meeting in Washington, D.C.,
<br>
Dr. Oliver Manuel says iron, not hydrogen, is the sun's most abundant
<br>
element.
<br>
<p>Manuel, a professor of nuclear chemistry at the University of Missouri-
<br>
Rolla, claims that hydrogen fusion creates some of the sun's heat, as
<br>
hydrogen -- the lightest of all elements -- moves to the sun's surface.
<br>
But most of the heat comes from the core of an exploded supernova that
<br>
continues to generate energy within the iron-rich interior of the sun,
<br>
Manuel says.
<br>
<p>&quot;We think that the solar system came from a single star, and the sun
<br>
formed on a collapsed supernova core,&quot; Manuel says. &quot;The inner planets
<br>
are made mostly of matter produced in the inner part of that star, and
<br>
the outer planets of material form the outer layers of that star.&quot;
<br>
<p>Manuel will present his the evidence for his assertion in his paper,
<br>
&quot;The Origin of the Solar System with an Iron-rich Sun,&quot; at 10 a.m.
<br>
Thursday, Jan. 10, at the AAS' 199th annual meeting at the Hilton
<br>
Washington and Towers in Washington, D.C. In addition, Cynthia Bolon,
<br>
a UMR graduate student in chemistry who has studied with Manuel, will
<br>
present related research in her paper, &quot;Repulsion and Attraction
<br>
between Nucleons: Sources of Energy for an Iron-rich Sun and for First
<br>
Generation Stars,&quot; following Manuel's presentation.
<br>
<p>Manuel says the solar system was born catastrophically out of a
<br>
supernova -- a theory that goes against the widely-held belief among
<br>
astrophysicists that the sun and planets were formed 4.5 billion years
<br>
ago in a relatively ambiguous cloud of interstellar dust.
<br>
<p>Iron and the heavy element known as xenon are at the center of Manuel's
<br>
efforts to change the way people think about the solar system's origins.
<br>
<p>Manuel believes a supernova rocked our area of the Milky Way galaxy
<br>
some five billion years ago, giving birth to all the heavenly bodies
<br>
that populate the solar system. Analyses of meteorites reveal that all
<br>
primordial helium is accompanied by &quot;strange xenon,&quot; he says, adding
<br>
that both helium and strange xenon came from the outer layer of the
<br>
supernova that created the solar system. Helium and strange xenon are
<br>
also seen together in Jupiter.
<br>
<p>Manuel has spent the better part of his 40-year scientific career
<br>
trying to convince others of his hypothesis. Back in 1975, Manuel and
<br>
another UMR researcher, Dr. Dwarka Das Sabu, first proposed that the
<br>
solar system formed from the debris of a spinning star that exploded
<br>
as a supernova. They based their claim on studies of meteorites and
<br>
moon samples which showed traces of strange xenon.
<br>
<p>Data from NASA's Galileo probe of Jupiter's helium-rich atmosphere in
<br>
1996 reveals traces of strange xenon gases -- solid evidence against
<br>
the conventional model of the solar system's creation, Manuel says.
<br>
<p>Manuel first began to develop the iron-rich sun theory in 1972. That
<br>
year, Manual and his colleagues reported in the British journal Nature
<br>
that the xenon found in primitive meteorites was a mixture of strange
<br>
and normal xenon (Nature 240, 99-101).
<br>
<p>The strange xenon is enriched in isotopes that are made when a
<br>
supernova explodes, the researchers reported, and could not be
<br>
produced within meteorites.
<br>
<p>Three years later, Manuel and Sabu found that all of the primordial
<br>
helium in meteorites is trapped in the same sites that trapped strange
<br>
xenon. Based on these findings, they concluded that the solar system
<br>
formed directly from the debris of a single supernova, and the sun
<br>
formed on the supernova's collapsed core. Giant planets like Jupiter
<br>
grew from material in the outer part of the supernova, while Earth
<br>
and the inner planets formed out of material form the supernova's
<br>
interior.
<br>
<p>This is why the outer planets consist mostly of hydrogen, helium
<br>
and other light elements, and the inner planets are made of heavier
<br>
elements like iron, sulfur and silicon, Manuel says.
<br>
<p>Strange xenon came from the helium-rich outer layers of the supernova,
<br>
while normal xenon came from its interior. There was no helium in the
<br>
interior because nuclear fusion reactions there changed the helium
<br>
into the heavier elements, Manuel says.
