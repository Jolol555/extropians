Boingboing.net has the following list of the 10 most likely ways the
<br>
human race could go extinct, from Stephen Petranek of Discover magazine.
<br>
(It was presented as the 10 ways the world could come to an end, but
<br>
obviously it is just talking about humanity.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We lose the will to survive (depression being the #1 mental
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illness)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Aliens invade Earth (most primitive civilizations do not survive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside contact)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Our Ecosystem collapses (e.g. we destroy the marginal tree in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rain forest or run out of fish)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Particle accelerator mishap - when we can make devices powerful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to make black holes we expect them to evaporate, but we can't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be sure.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Biotech disaster
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Reversal of Earth's magnetic field
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Solar flares
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Global epidemic
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Rogue black hole
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Asteroid collision
<br>
<p>I don't agree much with the list.  Depression wiping out the human race
<br>
is impossible because some people wouldn't be depressed and they would
<br>
out-reproduce the others.  Aliens invading is too unlikely because
<br>
of the coincidence of them arriving just as we are on the cusp of our
<br>
technological singularity.  Rogue black holes happening to wander into
<br>
the solar system seem fantastically unlikely.
<br>
<p>The particle accelerator accident is also remote because cosmic rays
<br>
come into our atmosphere with far more energy than we can hope to
<br>
produce, and they haven't eaten the earth yet.
<br>
<p>For some of the others we can get pretty good statistical evidence of
<br>
their frequency, like magnetic field reversal or asteroid collisions.
<br>
Statistically they are unlikely to be a serious threat to the whole human
<br>
race in the next few centuries.  Likewise with super-intense solar flares;
<br>
they would leave a fossil record of mass extinctions, and we know that
<br>
those don't happen that often.  Same with other astronomical events not
<br>
on the list like gamma ray bursts.
<br>
<p>This leaves ecosystem collapse, biotech disaster and global epidemic,
<br>
all variations on the same topic.  To these we should add the other two
<br>
members of Bill Joy's unholy trinity, nanotech disaster and runaway AI
<br>
(an unfriendly singularity).  If the human race has been wiped out a
<br>
century from now I would think it would be due to one of these causes.
<br>
I'm not sure how to rank their likelihood.
<br>
