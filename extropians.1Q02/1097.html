<em>&gt; Certainly, there are poor.  It is also an undeniable fact that

<em>&gt; accident that food is almost a free market but housing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health care are heavily regulated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>So are you agreeing or denying than even in the free-market 
<br>
(relatively) of food that there are shortfalls suffered by even 
<br>
some American citizens including children?
<br>
<p>Also, how do you account for the incredible amount of public and 
<br>
private debt in this country and its deleterious effects (around 
<br>
$6 trillion in federal debt alone, nearly 40% of the 
<br>
non-stolen-from-trust funds part held by foreign interests). 
<br>
Some urls about the debt and about the not so rosy sides of life 
<br>
in supposed the most capitalist and free-market of countries 
<br>
follow.  They are simply a currentl reading list and not at all 
<br>
giving coverage of the downside or even the all of those I have 
<br>
mentioned:
<br>

<a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/">http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/</a>
<br>
<p><p>We have deeply mortgaged our own future and chained ourselves 
<br>
more than a little.  And the above does not take into account 
<br>
the trillions of additional indebtedness at the state and local 
<br>
level.  Note the first of these links showing the stagnation of 
<br>
median income and the overall economic weakness of the middle 
<br>
class.  Clearly something is not so rosy in this supposed best
<br>
of economies.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I see the arguments for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;goodness of the theory and I see the suffering ones at the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;time.  I do not know if I have the best answer but I think I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have a very valid question that cannot be easily swept aside by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mere theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dammit, I'm not the one offering empty theories, you are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm talking about the actual evidence available to anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who will just open their eyes: look at the conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of /everyone/ on the planet and reason from that evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, there is suffering; but a rational human being has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compare what suffering exists under our present system to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under other systems, draw inferences about what makes them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different, and then extrapolate to what we can improve.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts--not theory, facts--are that free markets feed people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to the extent that we still have failures, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly regulatory obstacles to real solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>See the links above before you start cursing.  The evidence is 
<br>
not overwhelmingly in favor of what you claim.  Your blanket 
<br>
assertions are not &quot;facts&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Crying &quot;something must be done&quot; doesn't even rise to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of coherent theory--it's just an emotional reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's nothing wrong with compassion, but compassion feeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same number of people as &quot;theory&quot;--i.e., none.  But at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least the theory has a historical record leading to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people being fed than at anytime in history.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support the free market because it's a pretty theory.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support it because it is /proven/ to work in /reality/.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I am pointing out that your theory is very nice but it does not 
<br>
actually lead to the results you seem to believe it should or in 
<br>
any event it is not reasonably uniformly doing so at this time. 
<br>
And besides, the subject is not free-market theory but what you 
<br>
propose to do when people, real people, fall through the cracks. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many possible answers and many more I would find 
<br>
reasonable with some justification than you might suppose from 
<br>
your apparent opinion of where I am coming from, but I will not 
<br>
just quietly allow not even acknowledging there are real 
<br>
problems not yet addressed and not necessarily covered by the 
<br>
theories.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Go look at the homeless and then claim this.  Go look at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;projects a bit more closely.  Look into the some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;one-parent homes that now do not qualify for welfare and can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;find no work or source of income equal to what they once had. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Are you ignoring them or claiming they don't exist or that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are not relevant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're not listening: what I'm claiming is that the best way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help them is to remove the /cause/ oftheir poverty by making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the economy more free, and to trust in compassionate humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like youand me to fill the gaps where needed.  Voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion works, I only oppose compassion at gunpoint, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare programs and housing projects and other proven failures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>A more free economy doesn't really say much unless you say in 
<br>
what ways you will do this and also in what ways you will keep 
<br>
these people from very dire consequences while the changes to 
<br>
the economy take effect and hopefully help.  It might be that 
<br>
public programs are a bust universally but I don't think the 
<br>
case is airtight against them at this point.  It might be that 
<br>
we are as yet too poor to insure that no one strarves, at least 
<br>
not in America, or is homeless.  But the issue needs to be faced 
<br>
and we need to know what we are about including its consequences 
<br>
to real people.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Sorry.  The real world does not work like your ideals.  Not even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;here.  Certainly not in less developed countries.  So what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;happens to these people while we wait for your theory to work? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What happens if your theory is wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;real world&quot; has /proven/ to work more by my &quot;ideals&quot; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by what I'm assuming are yours--and I'm assuming because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't actually offered any solutions yourself.  Certainly now,
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't claim to have solutions but I point out that you haven't 
<br>
offered any either except theories you already believe have 
<br>
everything covered and where they don't it is just because the 
<br>
theory is not applied consistently and universally enough. 
<br>
Which of course is the same thing the communists used to say 
<br>
about their theories.  I am asking that you say what you believe 
<br>
should be done about the people who are falling through the 
<br>
cracks and especially what should be done if the number of 
<br>
people who do not find &quot;service&quot; jobs and do not have 
<br>
competitive technological skills increases as I believe it 
<br>
inevitably will.  I haven't seen you even acknowledge the 
<br>
problem yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and in the period during which we create a more free economy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassionate people will have to help those in need--I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said anything different.  But it is a moral imperative to fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the /cause/ of poverty, and to improve the condition of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, and I am doing that--by fighting government regulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and restrictions on free trade--because my conscience demands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  To do anything less would be an empty, false pretense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion, not the real thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>All of that sounds fine in principle.  But what will you do 
<br>
about the huge debts we are under?  They are eating away at our 
<br>
properity.  What will you do when/if the number of people 
<br>
working and with the means to help those not working goes below 
<br>
the amount that by any stretch of the imagination can cover 
<br>
thsoe without jobs?  What will you do when the federal debt is 
<br>
so high that even the interest on it swamps taxes collected and 
<br>
all the boomers retire and expect the money that has been 
<br>
siphoned off into the debt?
<br>
<p>It would be nice if there are clean, easy, straight-forward 
<br>
answers.  But I do not know of them if there are such.
