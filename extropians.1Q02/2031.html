<em>&gt; The morals encoded in our genes pale by comparison to the genetically

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if you really want to answer this question, you have to understand how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution managed to accidentally construct organisms who, as an emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome of their set of locally adaptive rules for moral reasoning, look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a &quot;meaning of life&quot; instead of being content with their inbuilt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals.  Without this knowledge you can't answer the question &quot;What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of life?&quot;  You can't even say for sure that it has no real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer.  Until you understand where the question comes from, you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the question.
</em><br>
<p>I agree to this last point, but I am not sure that &quot;moral reasonning&quot;
<br>
is really key to the psychological explanation for the Question.
<br>
<p>There is one simple point, which is that we were not meant, as
<br>
individuals, to realize we are mortal, and to reflect about it.
<br>
Animals seek what they are made to desire, and the stream of life (the
<br>
genes' purpose) goes through them that way. When one animal, to which
<br>
a strong sense of self has been given, realizes that he or she was
<br>
designed as instrumental to this stream of life (he is not the end --
<br>
in fact, though apparently *made to survive*, he is actualy *certain
<br>
to die*), a strange situation results. (in which we spent all of our
<br>
history so far)
<br>
<p>We were built for a well defined purpose (copying our genes), and
<br>
autonomy was given to us, so to speak, for seconding that purpose more
<br>
efficiently ; but too much autonomy it would seem, and too much
<br>
cognition, as it has now led us to reflect on that purpose and take
<br>
distance from it, and consequently to wonder what purpose we should
<br>
pursue.
<br>
<p>That's the origin of the Question. Not the fact that we of all things
<br>
seek to have purpose (&quot;moral reasoning&quot;) ; but the fact that we used
<br>
to act blindly according to a definite purpose, and by successive
<br>
steps we woke up from this and ended up strangely free (but mortal).
<br>
<p>If you think of evolution (or the genes) as a conscious designer, you
<br>
could say that he (or she) messed up, that he overlooked the
<br>
consequences of his design, and lost control of some of his robots
<br>
(humans). It's an old story told by many traditions (but in which the
<br>
creator is either God -- think Satan -- or Man -- think Dr Frankenstein's
<br>
creature --, not evolution), and it turns out that, with all the
<br>
support of our scientific understanding, we now realize this is actually
<br>
*our* story.
<br>
<p>The question is not really linked per se with consciousness of
<br>
mortality ; but that's a huge hint (that we are instrumental), and
<br>
that's why, though having no clue about evolution, humans started
<br>
suspecting something long ago.
