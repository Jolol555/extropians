<em>&gt; &gt; The principles do not seem to be enough to constrain an ethical system;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they do not form a set of ethical axioms or constrain the basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropian ethics. They certainly have ethical content, but this content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deals more with desirability of different things than the core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;mechanics&quot; of an ethical system. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But doesn't Extropianism give us a handle by which to judge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirability of different world outcomes?  And doesn't this, in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitute an ethical framework?
</em><br>
<p>Is stealing wrong, according to the extropian principles? We can make
<br>
deductions from the principles; we could maybe use the text of Self
<br>
Direction to deduce that coercion is not acceptable, and since theft is
<br>
to some extent coercion, hence theft is not acceptable. This could be
<br>
shored up by looking at supporting statements elsewhere in the text. But
<br>
in the end we would only have a weak ethical statement that does not
<br>
really tell us why stealing is bad: it is bad because coercion is bad,
<br>
and that is bad because it weakens the connection between personal
<br>
choice and personal outcome, decreasing personal responsibility. And
<br>
that is bad because it goes against self-direction. But why is
<br>
self-direction in the principles? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Personally I would say that this is not a flaw. Extropianism rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inherits the ethical underpinnings of its parent philosophies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; libertarianism and humanism (a kind of philosophical object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inheritance); it is compatible with most versions of them, and does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as expressed in the principles have to redo all the immense work that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has been done on expressing ethics and politics elsewhere. It is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like how Robert Nozick simply starts _Anarchy, State, Utopia_ by simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assuming certain rights - the book is not about deriving them, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what conclusions can be made *after* they have been derived. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not so comfortable thinking that we can graft conventional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism onto Extropianism, or that we can start with libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics as a foundation for our Extropian ethical system.  Haven't Max
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and others attempted to distance themselves from a strict libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to open the movement to a wider range of political philosophies?
</em><br>
<p>I would say that it is not a case of grafting libertarianism onto
<br>
extropianism. The libertarian ideas are already integral with the
<br>
principles, in the form of underlying assumptions. It is a bit like my
<br>
posting about the humanist roots of transhumanism: transhumanism
<br>
developed from humanism and incorporates much of it in its core
<br>
assumptions - even when such assumptions are seldom clearly aired. In
<br>
the same way extropianism derives from the transhumanist and libertarian
<br>
discourse, inhereiting ethical and other ideas by default. 
<br>
<p>Extropianism may not be much like conventional libertarianism (and even
<br>
less like specific libertarian movements), but the principles does not
<br>
make much sense if read in a context entirely free from libertarian and
<br>
humanist assumptions. After all, why is an open society where ideas and
<br>
products are produced and tested in an evolutionary manner preferable to
<br>
(say) a centrally controlled society? Why should the philosophy
<br>
advocated help individual humans rather than the collective? In fact,
<br>
one reason many people instinctively react with disgust to the
<br>
principles when they read them is that they come from an entirely
<br>
different philosophical background and has no familiarity with the
<br>
libertarian-humanist ideas - to many swedes, for example, they make
<br>
almost no sense at all. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps the clearest example of why the principles are not neutral is
<br>
the reading list. Why are those books there? Because they resonate with
<br>
the ideas of the principles. Imagine a list where Rand, Friedman and
<br>
Branden were replaced by Marx, Lenin and Mao. Would that list make the
<br>
slightest sense with the principles? If the extropian principles are
<br>
unrelated to the discourse in humanism and libertarianism, they ought to
<br>
be fairly neutral to what kind of political and ethical writings they
<br>
are combined with, but this is not the case. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even in the early days of this list, when most contributors were staunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarians, we explored outside the libertarian box.  We talked about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private law systems where communists who shared everything could live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and work side by side with capitalists who paid a fine for breathing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other guy's air.  We looked at forms of anarchy which were well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the libertarian mainstream.  All this was an attempt to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian goals of self transformation and expansion by giving people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximum freedom to experiment with interpersonal relations and agreements.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. Extropianism is about evolving and trying out new ideas, so
<br>
clearly we should not limit ourselves only to Approved Libertarian Ideas
<br>
(TM). But there is a difference between being ready to think about
<br>
unexpected or uncomfortable questions (Is state sponsored eugenics
<br>
always bad? Can a free market hypereconomy evolve into a virtual planned
<br>
economy, and would that be good? Is borganisms a better form of
<br>
existence than individuals?) and accepting all of these questions as
<br>
valid extropian positions. I'm perfectly willing to consider the
<br>
utilitarian idea of nuking Afghanistan to promote safety and speed the
<br>
singularity, but that doesn't mean it would be an extropian idea even if
<br>
it was a good idea. 
<br>
<p>Most of the libertarian inheritance in extropian thought is not on the
<br>
political level but rather on such core assumptions that individuals
<br>
matter, that it is better to be free than unfree, that each human has
<br>
their own life goals that they should be allowed to strive towards, that
<br>
initiating coercion is bad and so on. What kind of market is best is not
<br>
really a part of the inhereited set of ideas or the principles, but
<br>
something that has to be investigated from this basis. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the big question marks in the Principles which we did not explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much is whether they should be seen as collective or individual.  When we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek to maximize extropy, as defined by the Principles, are we trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do so each of us individually for ourselves, or for society and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world as a whole?  Is my goal a world with maximal extropy, or is it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world in which I personally have maximized my potentials?  I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Principles as giving a clear guideline for answering this question.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not even sure &quot;maximizing extropy&quot; has any meaning. What if extropy
<br>
is best regarded as a qualitative property and/or something individual
<br>
that cannot be compared across individuals? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is perhaps the most fundamental ethical question we face.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the difference between being generous and being selfish; between being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trustworthy and being a cheat; between being honest and lying for self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit.  If I can benefit myself by harming another, without getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught, should I do so?  It arguably maximizes my own potentials for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropy, but also arguably reduces the net extropy for the two of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although Extropianism is often seen as an individualistic philosophy, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think most of us would agree that from the ethical perspective, we care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about more than our own personal benefit.  We want to see a world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the potentials promoted by Extropianism are available to as many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible.  I don't know if many of us would go so far as to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would sacrifice ourselves if it increased the net extropy of the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we are far from being dedicated only to our own selfish goals.
</em><br>
<p>True. I would say this is where the principles do not quite give us
<br>
help, and even most libertarian ethical systems do not clearly describe
<br>
the reasons to behave &quot;truly&quot; altruistically. This may be a fruitful
<br>
area of philosophical investigation.
<br>
<p>Personally I see a value in complex and contingent systems outside of
<br>
myself; not only do they have a value to me (which is to some extent
<br>
just aesthetics), but they can have value to themselves too. A universe
<br>
with more beings that strive to grow and expand their potential seems to
<br>
be more extropic than a universe with less such beings. Even if extropy
<br>
is qualitative and incomensurable between individuals, one could always
<br>
compare how much these individuals value their extropy (for example
<br>
through a pricing comparision - how much of your resources would you pay
<br>
to increase your extropy further?). In fact, I think there is a deep
<br>
connection between extropy, perceived value and economic growth.
