<p>Yes. The interesting question is which of them are healthy. When stated
<br>
as above, the drive towards rationality is fairly inocuous, but the
<br>
description of Nash's desire for hyperrational beings or computers
<br>
suggests a more irrational form of rationality with a strong bias
<br>
against emotion. This form is commonly combined with looking down on the
<br>
&quot;weak&quot; flesh and a desire to escape one's body and/or humanity to a more
<br>
&quot;pure&quot; existence. 
<br>
<p>This afternoon I was reading Per Svensson's excellent _Musse är Ingen
<br>
Mus_ (&quot;Mickey Mouse is not a Mouse&quot;), a study of the philosophies behind
<br>
the animal rights movement. In one of the chapters he dissects the
<br>
anti-humanist tendency of many contemporary ideologies, which seek to
<br>
escape being an individual human forced to take responsibility for one's
<br>
actions. Among his examples, which are mostly from the left and
<br>
environmentalist movement, he also mentions the Heavens Gate Cult and
<br>
points out that their denial of the body and individuality stem from the
<br>
same philosophical sources. He even uses the term &quot;yearning for the
<br>
transhuman&quot;, which is one of the first instances of the word in Swedish
<br>
I have seen that is not directly related to mentions of our movement. 
<br>
<p>I consider this anti-body ideological syndrome something of a pathology
<br>
we should be on guard against in our own thinking. Sure, we want
<br>
*better* bodies, maybe even entirely virtual bodies one day. We want to
<br>
be able to think rationally and not be controlled by atavisms or
<br>
obsolete genetic programming. But at the same time we are seeking to
<br>
extend the truly human aspects of ourselves: our ability to choose our
<br>
own path, our ability to be truly individual - both alone and in groups,
<br>
we want to extend and enhance our aesthetics, emotions and ambitions. We
<br>
will always have flaws and limits, but we will strive to overcome them
<br>
rather than yearn for some unachievable perfect state. We seek to become
<br>
*more*, not less.
