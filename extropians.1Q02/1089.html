<em>&gt; Stuff can be SIMULATED in serial (cos the mathematics seems to boil down to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and serial are IDENTICAL, so maybe for real-time speed serial won't work.
</em><br>
<p><p>Parallel and serial processing are algorithmically equivalent, with parallel
<br>
processing being the more restricted of the two.  The only qualitative
<br>
difference is that massively parallel processing has transaction theory
<br>
issues that make it less capable than serial processing for some types of
<br>
work.  In the best case scenario, you get an n-fold speed-up of the serial
<br>
algorithm.  (For a couple reasons having to do with how real hardware works,
<br>
you can actually have super-linear scalability for a very miniscule set of
<br>
problems, but that is neither here nor there.)  What is an example of an
<br>
algorithm that is qualitatively different on a parallel system versus a
<br>
serial one?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; No, JR wasn't saying that, but BRAINS are self-organising in hardware, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just soft-programmable. Computers aren't sentient, E1-brains are! I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying absolutely that sentience/ abstract thought is only theoretically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible on clockless logic (lost clock! Not even designed clockless) ... but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't argue that it has only ever be obseved on this type of circuit!!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mathematics is just analogy, a fiction ... I am more interested in the biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and evolutionary history of how the E1-brain actually works ... nets don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model very neatly into math anyway cos never reach perfect rest states.
</em><br>
<p><p>In this case, it is essentially an argument from ignorance, as both of us
<br>
are missing fundamental information.  There is literally no practical
<br>
difference between hardware and software.  Obviously, though I don't see it
<br>
like you do either.  Consider the following bits of information:
<br>
<p>1) Mathematics describes extremely sensitive tests for &quot;finite state
<br>
machine-ness&quot;.  They positively determine whether a process is describable
<br>
on finite state machinery with high probability, though some extremely
<br>
complex FS processes can escape detection.
<br>
<p>2) Any finite state machine is expressible on an ordinary computer, though
<br>
devising a practical expression may be very difficult.  General solutions do
<br>
exist however.
<br>
<p>3) The human mind never fails to test positive as being an extremely complex
<br>
piece of finite state machinery as described in #1.  A many such tests have
<br>
been done on different aspects of the mind.
<br>
<p>Assuming that these three facts are true, then it is necessarily possible to
<br>
express all tested aspects of the mind on an ordinary computer.  With
<br>
sufficient software capability for adaptive algorithm construction (a hard
<br>
software problem, but a solvable one), you could clone every aspect of the
<br>
human mind that behaves like an FSM.  At what point does the software
<br>
running on an ordinary computer fail to be sentient, when it has reached the
<br>
point of being indistinguishable from the human?  The only real out provided
<br>
is the possibility that some part of the mind is not a piece of FSM, but
<br>
that is looking pretty unlikely at this point.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
