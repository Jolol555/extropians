From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ... If so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we will be bumping average longevity from ~75 to ~90 within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this decade, or ~15 years / decade.
</em><br>
<p>Whether this happens or not, it makes sense to save some part of one's
<br>
income for retirement and self-insurance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;The no-brainer strategy to becoming wealthy&quot;.  It requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking $100-$1000 and depositing it in a savings account or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutual fund and never withdrawing any funds from the account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the annual increase in the account value exceeds what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one reasonably needs to live in the world ...
</em><br>
<p>But this is the general idea behind retirement accounts. The puzzle to me is
<br>
that everyone isn't doing this anyhow. Not merely making a one-time deposit
<br>
but putting a portion of all revenue into conservative long term
<br>
investments. This isn't a particularly good time for CD's or savings
<br>
accounts, but there are still some low-risk mutual funds that are providing
<br>
acceptable rates of return.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would seem that Extropians/Transhumanists should be the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to recognize the paradigm shift and adopt this strategy.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see any evidence that any of these individuals that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know have done so.
</em><br>
<p>Depending on whose figures you believe, the US had a negative savings rate
<br>
for a while. The ratio between savings and debt seems to have increased
<br>
since September, 2001. But I suspect this represents more of a decrease in
<br>
new consumer debt rather than actual savings. It would be interesting to
<br>
know whether Extropians on average save more than the population in general.
<br>
<p>=======================
<br>
<a href="http://www.econ.iastate.edu/retail/Nov16,2001-savingsrate.pdf">http://www.econ.iastate.edu/retail/Nov16,2001-savingsrate.pdf</a>
<br>
The chart below shows the personal savings rate in the United States by
<br>
month from
<br>
January, 1990 through September, 2001. The personal savings rate measures
<br>
savings
<br>
as a percent of after-tax income. It declined steadily throughout the 1990's
<br>
reaching a
<br>
low of 0.4% in September, 2000, as consumers spent proportionately greater
<br>
amounts
<br>
of their incomes. Low interest rates, expanded credit availability, and a
<br>
general confidence in a strong U.S.
<br>
economy are among the forces behind this declining trend.
<br>
During the past few months, however, the rate has increased sharply,
<br>
climbing to 4.7% in September,
<br>
2001. This provides evidence that many people are responding to the
<br>
increasing economic uncertainty by
<br>
curtailing spending and increasing their savings.
<br>
<p>=====================
<br>
<p>Hard to say what effect the Enron collapse has had/will have on behavior,
<br>
other than to encourage people to diversify their retirement plans. But the
<br>
fact remains that most people in the US don't *have* retiremet plans or if
<br>
they have one, it doesn't contain nearly enough to live on. In an effort to
<br>
encourage savings, the US Congress increased the annual amount people over
<br>
the age of 50 can contribute to their IRA's and 401(k)'s.(the Restoring
<br>
Earnings to Lift Individuals and Empower Families (RELIEF) Act of 2001).
<br>
Small biz owners (less than 100 employees) note: there are provisions in the
<br>
act that apply specifically to you.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;So the &quot;interesting question&quot; is &quot;Why
<br>
<em>&gt; is this the case?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>To speculate about the underlying causes would require a book; but the short
<br>
answer is that most people are in debt up to their eyeballs and have zero
<br>
left over each month after paying living expenses and debt service.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Possible explanations I can think of are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) We don't really believe lifespan extension of more than 1 yr/yr
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is feasible
</em><br>
<p>This may be true, but there's more to it than this, since people aren't
<br>
saving even for &quot;normal&quot; retirement years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) We believe the NanoSantas will make all wealth creation strategies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    irrelevant
</em><br>
<p>I've sensed this attitude among some of the younger list members.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; d) We belive the singularity will so totally disrupt things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    all wealth creation strategies are irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>I myself believe this to some extent. At the same time, this reinforces my
<br>
attitude that flexibility is the way to go. While I wouldn't advocate living
<br>
a life of miserable penury in order to accumulate more money in savings,
<br>
having some money set aside could be extremely helpful, as you say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who wants to join the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is willing to walk their talk?
</em><br>
<p>Why would a Foundation be necessary or desireable?
