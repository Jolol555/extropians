The FIRST Robotics Competition is an exciting, nationwide competition that
<br>
teams professionals and young people to solve an engineering design problem in
<br>
an intense and competitive way. The program is a life-changing, career-molding
<br>
experience—and a lot of fun. In 2002 the competition will reach more than
<br>
20,000 students on over 600 teams in 17 competitions. Our teams come from
<br>
Canada, Brazil, the U.K., and almost every U.S. state. The competitions are
<br>
high-tech spectator sporting events, the result of lots of focused
<br>
brainstorming, real-world teamwork, dedicated mentoring, project timelines,
<br>
and deadlines.

FIRST founder and Segway inventor Dean Kamen says the contest is mainly meant
<br>
to teach kids about camaraderie and critical thinking rather than competition
<br>
&quot;They've learned electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, how to think,
<br>
how to understand, how to work on big problems, how professionals use their
<br>
minds and their tools to change the world,&quot; Kamen said.
<br>
&quot;I want to see these kids have an opportunity to grow and use resources that
<br>
would not have been available to them if NASA had not participated,&quot; said
<br>
Joseph Hering, a robotics education coordinator. &quot;Naturally, we'd like to have
<br>
them back as NASA engineers -- maybe astronauts.&quot;

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
