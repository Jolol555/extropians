<em>&gt; I remember plenty, but I do not remember anything saying 'We shall not
</em><br>
ever
<br>
<em>&gt; contact alien species'
</em><br>
<p>I've read it twice. Both times from you.
<br>
I still think it's easier for religionists to believe in contact with &quot;alien
<br>
species&quot; than it is for scientists to believe it, because unlike
<br>
religionists,
<br>
scientists require evidence.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>In your original reply to my post, you said 
<br>
<p>&quot;Contact with ETI may profoundly effect religion, but it won't destroy
<br>
religion, because religion is based on fantasy to begin with (just as ETI
<br>
is). In contrast, contact with ETI would shatter science completely, because
<br>
it would refute the very laws of physics (which I don't expect to happen).&quot;
<br>
<p>The latter sentance 
<br>
<p>&quot;In contrast, contact with ETI would shatter science completely, because it
<br>
would refute the very laws of physics&quot;  
<br>
<p>seems to imply that contact with ETI would refute the very laws of physics.
<br>
To which I asked Which laws of physics explicitly forbid that.  If there is
<br>
some law of physics that dictates such a thing, I would like to know about
<br>
it.  What laws of physics would contact with ETI refute?  (Unless, as I
<br>
said, there is a law of physics which directly forbids contact with ETI,
<br>
hence the 'I dont remember reading that law of physics in any physics book)
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
