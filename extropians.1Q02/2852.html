<em>&gt; &gt;Yes, when I first learned that the Steve Jackson in the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Steve Jackson, I was happily surprised. I quite literally

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Extropy. I'm sure there are a number of stories like this out there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed.  I used to borrow these books from a local library.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deathtrap Dungeon was my favourite.  Now was it Emerald, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diamond, Sapphire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to escape, or Diamond...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nice to see he's involved.

<p>I wander past this little sci fi bookshop in town here (&quot;Known Space&quot;),
<br>
almost every day. Purportedly it's open wed/thu/fri/sat afternoons, but I've
<br>
never noticed it actually be open before, and I've been walking past it for
<br>
about 8 months now.
<br>
<p>Today, it was open. I wandered in. It smells musty and, combined with the
<br>
humidity, has this sense of laguid intrigue draped around it. Stuffed with
<br>
sci-fi/fantasy/comics/etc floor to ceiling.
<br>
<p>Anyway, what should I see but a couple of shelves packed with Fighting
<br>
Fantasy (amongst many more of the CYOA genre). Wow! I bought most of them...
<br>
<p>The Forest of Doom, Starship Traveller, Deathtrap Dungeon, Island of the
<br>
Lizard King, Scorpion Swamp, House of Hell, and Steve Jackson's Sorcery
<br>
series KHARE - Cityport of Traps.
<br>
<p>I'll have a look at them on the bus home today. I wonder if I'm in for a
<br>
treat, or for that same disillusionment I suffered on playing on a C64
<br>
recently?
<br>
<p>Emlyn
<br>
(oh yeah, and I bought a book called &quot;The Sea's Furthest End&quot; by some guy.
<br>
It's not CYOA, but it could be good anyway, who knows?)
