<em>&gt; Samantha, do you have any idea of the relative fraction that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; induced (self-hazard)?
</em><br>
<p>Furthermore, there are no stats on how many auto accidents are drug
<br>
induced (either intentionally or unintentionally) since doing tox
<br>
screens isn't mandated in every accidental death, nor are suspects in
<br>
traffic accidents generally given blood tests. Various surveys indicate
<br>
that the combined alcohol/drug share of accidents is upwards of 75%.
<br>
<p>The weather induced fraction falls typically into two areas:
<br>
hydroplaning, and snow/ice sliding, though there is a small number from
<br>
hail, floods, bridge collapses, etc. Thus the majority of weather
<br>
induced accidents are the direct responsibility of the vehicle owners
<br>
buying decisions with regard to a)tires, b) brake service, and c)
<br>
vehicle features (Antilock brakes, power steering, airbags, etc), or
<br>
else the driver's skills in adverse conditions.
<br>
<p>In my experience, few driver safety programs in the country ever teach
<br>
students to drive in adverse conditions, and no DMV tests check for such
<br>
skills. Most people outside of the northern tier states never consider
<br>
driving in snow/ice conditions to be a frequent occurence, although
<br>
hydroplaning should be expected frequently.
<br>
<p>The best indicator of accident tendency is age. Drivers under 21 and
<br>
over 65 are mostly likely to cause accidents, and the youngest and
<br>
oldest drivers have as much as ten times greater risk than mature
<br>
drivers. 
<br>
<p>Distraction is another contributor, whether its tuning a stereo, talking
<br>
on the cell phone, dealing with kids, or the classic female morning
<br>
combo of make-up, dressing, hair drying while driving and chatting on
<br>
the cellphone and trying to tune the radio or change a CD. While guys
<br>
can approach this, the worst we've got to do is shave while driving
<br>
(been there, done it).
