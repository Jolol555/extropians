<p>In my definitions, 'measureability' was not really considered. It was more
<br>
of a personal observation in the absense of any useful dictionary definition
<br>
(2 included below). In terms of an AI I suppose objectivity &amp; measureability
<br>
is important, so I may include the above in my definition if that's OK with
<br>
you. This material is going into a book/journal and eventually it will be
<br>
scrutinised by someone. It is an interesting problem in AI to define a
<br>
standard against which an AI may be 'calibrated'.
<br>
<p>Eventually I hope to have a sliding scale of consciousness and sentience
<br>
defined, so that an AI can be tailored to suit it's application. If I was an
<br>
intelligent agent deployed to monitor a tank farm in Siberia, I wouldn't
<br>
really want to be overly conscious or have an innappropriate  set of goals.
<br>
I don't know yet, but I suspect there are one or two 'connectivities' (most
<br>
likely the inclusion of 'self' modelling) that will make it a
<br>
non-linear/threshold scale, and create a focal point for ethicists.
