eric chen opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;A number of us had probably not consider the possibility that Digital 
<br>
Physics and God can co-exist (with God as programmers outside
<br>
the simulation), though He/She/It/They would probably not have such egoistic 
<br>
desires that some others had believe (like requiring
<br>
absolute belief in Its existence or your entry into a computer simulation 
<br>
that will inflict pain on you for apparently forever). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, Fredkin physics and Jurgen Schmiudhuber papers. At this pouint, unless a 
<br>
Singularity comes along comapartively soon, or one is a supporter of 
<br>
cryonics, the question, as you have suggested, is pendantic. Of course, that 
<br>
has never stopped anyone on this list from addressing such an issue, 
<br>
including myself.  
<br>
<p>You think of a 'raison d' etre' for survival, I would surmise the need for 
<br>
intellectual stimulation, and the need for even digital minds to obtain a 
<br>
temporary condition of satisfaction. Satisfaction can be 'inherently, 
<br>
engineered, into such uber beings to be self-contained, and self-satisfied, 
<br>
and thus when a particular cosmos or domain ceases, the minds that inhabit 
<br>
them would also. 
<br>
<p>Back to the 'raison', think of dead universes, and the desire for enjoying 
<br>
watching them brought to life (digital or otherwise) and seeing evolving uber 
<br>
minds evolving is many of those. Kind of fun for the uber minds, especially 
<br>
if the results are difficult to predict.
