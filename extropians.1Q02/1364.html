Yep.  The few times I've been somewhere where public nudity was 
<br>
ok for any length of time were quite eye-opening. :-)
<br>
<p>Actually it usually went like this:
<br>
&quot;Look at those young 20 - somethings with their absolutely 
<br>
perfect bodies.  If I looked like that I would be strutting 
<br>
around too!  I would look really awful beside them.&quot;
<br>
<p>later...
<br>
&quot;Holy shit, look at those really flabby and out of shape people 
<br>
in the nude!  Even I look better than that!&quot;
<br>
<p>later still...
<br>
&quot;Oh, it's time to leave.  Oh yeah, that means I have to put 
<br>
clothes on again. Bummer. Do I really have to go?&quot;
<br>
<p>Really, it took about a day to get used to the first time.  Then 
<br>
it didn't matter at all.  People are no more sex objects (or 
<br>
anti-sexy and repulsive) than they were before.  Usually a lot 
<br>
less on just a physical body level. Showing a lot of skin 
<br>
becomes more neutral. You really do get used to it.  And it was 
<br>
incredibly freeing.  I enjoyed it a lot.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The following pieces are from: Humorous Introduction to Naturism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.netnude.com/main/intro.html#intro">http://www.netnude.com/main/intro.html#intro</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; {begin quote}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody knows for certain exactly how many naturists there are in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, but the numbers of those enjoying a clothes optional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifestyle appear to be increasing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, naturism still carries a stigma, born largely of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance of the truth. To some naturists are well meaning but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly dotty individuals, who meander naked through wooded glades,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pausing in catalogue poses behind strategically placed leaves. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others, they are immoral hedonists, congregating in mixed groups to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoy pleasures of the flesh in orgy situations not seen since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Caesar hung up his laurels. Or they are perverts trying to corrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'normal'way of life. As with the majority of prejudices based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lies, misunderstandings and half-truths, the reality of life for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average naturist is very different indeed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I COULD NEVER BE A NUDIST ANYWAY - JUST LOOK AT MY BODY!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the whole point though. Naturism isn't about looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies - naturists are not exhibitionists. It's just about enjoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the freedom that a clothes optional atmosphere brings. Naturism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about accepting the human body for what it is - nothing to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ashamed of. So the men don't need to hit the gym for six months,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buffing their muscles to within an inch of their lives in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gain entry. And the women don't have to look like Baywatch babes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The media is largely responsible for promoting this idea of body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfection, but the truth is that the vast majority of people do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, nor are they likely to ever resemble this false ideal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So for naturists there is no such thing as too fat, too thin, too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short, too tall, too hairy. Nobody's going to comment on the size or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shape of your breasts or critically evaluate your genitalia. And if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have any surgical scars or other distinguishing marks you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needn't worry - ignore them just like everyone else will. For most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, their initial discomfort disappears very quickly, once they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize they are not being judged on their appearance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BUT WHAT DO PEOPLE GET OUT OF IT? IF IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX, JUST WHAT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IS IT ABOUT?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's about relaxation, freedom from restriction - and to a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large degree, it's about honesty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturists are judged on their personalities alone. They take away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trappings that most of us have around us every day. They have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less to 'hide behind'. This is very healthy, because it means that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendships are built on truth - as people get used to being open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with each other, there is less temptation to embellish![...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being nude can also be incredibly relaxing. The feeling of air, sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and water on the skin is a terrific stress reliever.  [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IT CAN'T BE HEALTHY FOR CHILDREN THOUGH, SURELY.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, children who grow up in a naturist environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually have far fewer hang-ups than other kids. Once again, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not being subjected to premature sexual situations - they grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up around other children and adults, understanding that the body is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not something to be hidden and ashamed of. They know anatomy of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human body, and it is less of a 'taboo' to be explored at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earliest opportunity. There are fewer incidences of teenage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and criminal behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amongst nudist children than amongst other children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHERE WOULD I PUT MY SUNGLASSES!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for the sunglasses, well friends have found that nipple rings are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the perfect holders for their Ray Bans. If you don't fancy body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piercing, though, a small bag slung around your neck or carried with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you is the perfect repository for your small change and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessities.
