<p>Sounds fascinating. I'd like to mention another recent sf novel, ECHOES OF
<br>
EARTH (Ace pb, Jan 2002), by Aussies Sean Williams and Shane Dix. There'll
<br>
be a review soon by Paul Di Filippo (who gives it an A-), viewable at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/advance/11_books.html">http://www.scifi.com/sfw/advance/11_books.html</a>
<br>
<p>It's a post-Spike novel (and I was delighted to find that they've used this
<br>
term, although their grisly version of the Singularity isn't one I'd care
<br>
to have stuck to my coinage for the rest of time). Inter alia, there's a
<br>
rather interesting throw-away cosmogonic speculation near the start; I
<br>
don't really think it makes sense since they blend the Many Worlds QT model
<br>
with state reduction; still, I find it intriguing... 
<br>
<p>=========================
<br>
<p>Adrasteia was small, dense and rugged, bombarded by rubble left over
<br>
from its evolution and at the mercy of severe plate tectonics.  Its
<br>
atmosphere was substantial enough to give rise to dramatic pressure
<br>
differentials: at the bottom of the canyon Alander inhabited, the air
<br>
was far too dense to be comfortable, while at the top of the nearest
<br>
peak it might as well have been a vacuum. The average temperature was
<br>
below the freezing point of water, and what little oxygen existed was
<br>
mostly generated by cyanobacteria sharing the air with the clouds
<br>
above -- clouds trapped in warmer atmospheric layers and never
<br>
yielding rain.  Apart from the clouds the planet's main water reserves
<br>
lay underground.  It probably wouldn't be that way forever -- or even
<br>
for long, if the terraformers got their way -- but for now, the only
<br>
remotely habitable planet around Upsilon Aquarius was proving to be a
<br>
pain in the ass.  Certainly nothing as wonderful as his original self
<br>
must have imagined it would be.
<br>
<p>But there was life, of a kind.  Apart from faint hints in the deep
<br>
equatorial basins some of his fellow surveyors were exploring, the
<br>
cyanobacteria in the clouds proved once and for all that such could
<br>
evolve independently on another world.  There was no way they could
<br>
have come from Earth, as did, some skeptics still believed, those
<br>
found on Mars and Io.  And the fact they were little different to the
<br>
ones back home added credence to the original Peter Alander's theories
<br>
concerning the origins of life in the universe, not to mention why
<br>
there were no aliens waiting to greet the survey teams when they
<br>
arrived.
<br>
<p>His original would have been pleased, that was for sure.  The
<br>
Adrasteian cyanobacteria had never evolved into anything terribly
<br>
sophisticated.  There seemed to be no reason why they shouldn't have,
<br>
though; conditions here were not fundamentally dissimilar to those
<br>
that existed on Earth, Mars or Europa.  Adrasteian life-forms hadn't
<br>
evolved any further, his original would have argued, because the odds
<br>
were stacked so far against such a thing happening that it shouldn't
<br>
happen even once in the lifetime of the universe.  In fact, life
<br>
should not have evolved at all -- even to the level of bacteria.
<br>
<p>The fact that it had evolved suggested otherwise, unless one viewed
<br>
the early universe as a massive quantum computer, a near-infinite
<br>
number of parallel universes engaged in incomprehensible
<br>
&quot;computations&quot; from the moment of its creation -- smashing elements
<br>
together, creating new compounds and smashing those together in
<br>
turn -- until something appeared that could be called &quot;alive&quot;.  This
<br>
unicellular life wasn't conscious, but it appeared and flourished
<br>
everywhere, on numerous worlds, multiplying and evolving in the
<br>
strange, uncollapsed place that was the unobserved universe.
<br>
<p>The moment consciousness occurred, though, down one of those possible
<br>
reality-paths, the collapse occurred.  The universe, observed, could
<br>
no longer nurture the conditions required to &quot;parallel-process&quot;
<br>
bacteria to consciousness.  Once just one being saw, it robbed all
<br>
other life-forms the chance to evolve.  Rapid evolution stopped in its
<br>
tracks, confined as the universe now was just to one track at a time.
<br>
Even with a near-infinite number of stars in the universe, the odds
<br>
shrank to almost zero that other conscious life-forms would emerge
<br>
from primitive organisms, since it was too unlikely to happen in a
<br>
single universe -- and thus the majority of worlds humans surveyed
<br>
would be inhabited by nothing more exciting than bacterial sludge that
<br>
had evolved, in the past.
<br>
<p>The lack of complex alien life on Adrasteia seemed to support his
<br>
original's argument: that humans were the universe's present
<br>
observers, and that they would find no other intelligent life-forms
<br>
anywhere, just many different types of dead-end bacteria.  There would
<br>
be nothing more, in fact, until humanity died out and the universe
<br>
could resume its quantum computations.
<br>
<p><p>=======================
<br>
<p>Curiously, my own novel THE JUDAS MANDALA (belatedly published in the
<br>
States in 1982) offers almost the exact opposite conjecture: a transhuman
<br>
species of humans, under the auspices of a posthuman superior group
<br>
uploaded into machine substrate (rather inappropriately called cyborgs),
<br>
teach their doctrine to a somewhat more recognizable human; this section is
<br>
from a chunk published in 1976 in the American magazine GALILEO, under the
<br>
title `Growing Up'):
<br>
<p>========================
<br>
<p>`It is impossible to argue against the cyborg *Weltanschauung*. To do so
<br>
would be absurd. The patterns they can manipulate so far surpass those we
<br>
can command that we must take what they tell us on faith. And what they
<br>
reveal is that life is a temporary necessary aberration in the unfolding of
<br>
a deterministic cosmos.'
<br>
<p>`Gigo,' she says wearily. `The hoariest fallacy known to science: Garbage
<br>
In, Garbage Out.'
<br>
<p>For a moment the beautiful ageless man shows anger. Sriyanie has ventured
<br>
close to blasphemy. He goes on, after a pause: `I've experienced its truth,
<br>
Sriyanie. At the universal dawn, in the great White Hole, the metrodynamic
<br>
was clear and linear and untarnished by Uncertainty. The cosmos told its
<br>
time by a perfect clockwork, a sublime Newtonian machine. Cause and effect
<br>
were simple and total. The intrusive blight of quantum probabilities had
<br>
not yet arisen.'
<br>
<p>Dumbly, she shakes her head. His words are so close to the truth, as all
<br>
effective deceit must be, but he has everything turned about.
<br>
<p>`Inevitably, the planets coalesced about their suns, organic acids came
<br>
together at their ice caps, amino acids formed as the enriched ice thawed,
<br>
peptides, proteins, nucleotides--life. And the first disharmony intruded.
<br>
Life multiplied, complexified, transformed the worlds where it was born,
<br>
and introduced everywhere its own randomizing horrors.'
<br>
<p>`No,' Sriyanie says, aghast, `you're wrong.'
<br>
<p>`But observing mind came from life,' Livani insists, more loudly. `The
<br>
underlying order of the metric frame was discovered anew, and the
<br>
possibility revived that it might regain its Laplacean grandeur. The
<br>
cyborgs are that hope embodied: mind free of the organic pestilence which
<br>
structured all five-space non-null-entropy systems into the ugliness of
<br>
unreason.'
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>`Of *course* life structures the metric frame,' she cries. `Of *course* it
<br>
imposes constrains on the primordial condition. But that Ur-State is
<br>
synchronistic. From the White Hole until the protozoa, the cosmic
<br>
parameters interacted only by affinity! How else do you suppose that life
<br>
arose? There simply wasn't *time* for the process to occur in your
<br>
Laplacean fantasy.... If the Newtonian laws have some general validity,
<br>
it's precisely because intention and value-ridden perception have *made*
<br>
them work. It's only by profound inner silence, a stilling of the beta
<br>
activity in your head, a retreat from will to wish, that the primal reality
<br>
can reassert itself. You hivers stuff yourselves to overflowing with a
<br>
clamor of contingent facts, and relinquish magic.'
<br>
<p>`The goal of consciousness,' Livani says stubbornly, `is the hypostasy of
<br>
reason.'
<br>
<p>`The goal of consciousness,' Sriyanie retorts, `is a harmonious
<br>
equilibration of confluence and cause. Your culture strives to enforce
<br>
predictability and you achieve nothing but a totalitarian extinction of all
<br>
that's beautiful and loving in the universe.' [etc]
<br>
<p>==================
<br>
<p>I don't agree with either of them, of course. :)
