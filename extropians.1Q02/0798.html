</em><br>
<p>It is important to learn what is rational and irrational speculation.
<br>
What people like Robert, Anders, John, etc are engaging in is rational
<br>
speculation based entirely on sound and established scientific
<br>
knowledge.
<br>
<p>Talk of humanity being farmed by alien races is irrational speculation,
<br>
because it assumes facts not in evidence: i.e. the presence of aliens on
<br>
earth at any time in history or prehistory as far as we can determine.
<br>
However, as soon as real material evidence of such a presence is found
<br>
and announced, such speculation then can become rational speculation.
<br>
<p>This is a fine distinction, but one that separates science from
<br>
supermarket tabloids.
