<em>&gt; The option has recently arisen to me to become an organ donor. I am a devout

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you are interested in cryonic suspension, then organ donation is to
<br>
be specifically avoided, since having you dead long enough to remove the
<br>
organs generally leaves your brain in much worse shape than would occur
<br>
if you were run through the suspension protocol at time of death. You
<br>
should try to completely overwrite the notation on your drivers license
<br>
that asks if you are an organ donor, since I have heard of occurences of
<br>
people's licenses being marked by hospital personnel for organ donation
<br>
if they come in in a vegetative state (the same sort of institutions
<br>
that walk off with your watch and jewelry too, I imagine) with an
<br>
unmarked license. 
<br>
<p>I have a large black swath of ink blanking out the entire line on the
<br>
back of my driver's license. Now that I'm back to work, I plan on
<br>
signing up for suspension as soon as possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would assume that the basic, preliminary response to be &quot;absolutly&quot; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the logic behind recycling (of organs). Also,one would be extending (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving the quality of)a fellow being's life.
</em><br>
<p>If you have no intention of preserving your own into the future, go for
<br>
it. Think about this, though: most donated organs go to people who
<br>
thoroughly abused their own organs, what makes you think they'll have
<br>
any more respect for yours? They may be thankful as all hell to live,
<br>
but usually not enough to do what is necessary to help them live more
<br>
than a few years after the transplant operation.
<br>
<p>Robin Hanson's papers in the last few years have done much to illustrate
<br>
that health care such as this does markedly little to extend human life
<br>
or improve the quality of life, especially in respect to the expense
<br>
incurred in doing so, with the exception of improving the quality of
<br>
life of the doctors collecting the money...
