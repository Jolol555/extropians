<em>&gt; Yes, i also started a second BSc in Biochem last year (currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonised), and was very tempted to setup a lab in my garage.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem was that i didn't have a garage.  That is solved now, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, more important, problem is cost.  Centrifugues look cheap and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem almost easy to build, but gels cost $A10 a pop, and the enzyme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices are astronomical.  Considering the percentage of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; botched pracs (&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 75%) i did last year, it could become a very expensive hobby.
