<em>&gt; I see three flaws with this scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first is the assumption that your uploaded self will be faster.  People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always quote the speed of electricity vs. the speed of neurons, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fail to take into account the paralell processing that goes on in the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.  Just as a far-fetched example, if I uploaded a person into an Excel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreadsheet, each variable change would take seconds (minutes? hours?) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recalculate the entire spreadsheet.  Such an upload would be horribly SLOW
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to flesh and blood.
</em><br>
<p>You're probably right, initially uploads will be slow and probably
<br>
have other deficiencies as well.  However I think the proposed scenario
<br>
applies to a later phase.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eventually, they will fix this.  They will make processors and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiprocessor systems faster.  They question is will people use them?  Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are speeded up to normal, would you want to speed up faster?  Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone jumps in to say yes, ask yourself why?  If you can already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate to the uploaded people quite fine, who would be the first to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to go faster?  All that would happen is that everyone else (uploaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not) would be boringly slow to you.  You, yourself would not feel any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference.  So, who would spend time and effort to do it?
</em><br>
<p>There would be tremendous economic advantages to being able to go faster.
<br>
Imagine if you had a lawyer or a researcher who could think 10 times
<br>
faster than the other guy.  Imagine if you were at a meeting and a
<br>
problem came up, and you could &quot;freeze time&quot; and figure out an answer
<br>
in a couple of hours, then deliver it seemingly instantaneously.  There
<br>
are any number of fields where speed of human information processing is
<br>
the bottleneck.  Imagine if you could keep up with all the technical
<br>
or medical research relevant to your job.
<br>
<p>There are so many advantages that Robin Hanson predicts that uploads
<br>
would end up taking over essentially all information processing work,
<br>
which is a substantial and increasing part of human labor.  There is no
<br>
way a normal human can compete with someone who can think X times faster.
<br>
The real problem, then, is what non-uploads will do with such a handicap,
<br>
not what uploads will do with their advantages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The second flaw is sheer boredom.  Even if the technology makes you faster,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how many people have the focus to think about something for a  month at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time?  I see no reason to believe that the uploaded month of thinking would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much more productive than the flesh and blood month of thinking.
</em><br>
<p>First, I don't think you would literally think for a month at a time,
<br>
any more than you do that today.  Rather, you would put in a month's
<br>
worth of work in a vastly smaller amount of time.  You would still
<br>
take breaks, sleep, watch TV etc.
<br>
<p>As far as the problem of what kinds of breaks a sped-up person could
<br>
enjoy, there are several approaches.  One is to be able to slow down
<br>
sometimes.  Presumably a fast machine can be made to run slowly.
<br>
Then you can interact with the real world, although it will be an
<br>
expensive vacation (in terms of foregone income).  The other is to
<br>
interact with other high-speed uploads.  Another form of recreation is
<br>
to just surf the net, participate in chats, enjoy pre-recorded video
<br>
and music.  With hundreds of millions of people online, even a vastly
<br>
sped-up mentality can probably find enough novelty to keep him interested
<br>
during breaks.
<br>
<p>There was a time when some people read EVERYTHING posted to usenet.
<br>
Maybe an upload could do the same thing again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The third flaw is economics.  Even if you have a fast upload, and a mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focused enough to think about something for a month at a time, why would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they?  Today, companies pay people money.  Without money people can't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food.  How many people, if they didn't need food or shelter, would work for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else instread of on their own ideas?  I don't think uploaded people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would care enough.  (They might care about cancer, or something, but those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues have been thought out enough that just sitting and thinking won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help those issues.)
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you are saying here.  Is it that uploaded people don't
<br>
need food and shelter (just virtual food and shelter) and so they won't
<br>
have any expenses?  However you are neglecting the expense of the computer
<br>
which runs them.  Presumably the upload needs to make enough to pay for
<br>
that.  Then there are the tele-operated robot bodies he uses on vacation.
<br>
Those aren't cheap you know.  Plus he's going to run up quite a bill at
<br>
Blockbuster Video renting 1000 videos a week.  That's a quarter million
<br>
dollars a year right there.
<br>
<p>Uploads will have expenses, and there will probably be advantages to being
<br>
rich even if you are an upload.  There is no particular reason to expect
<br>
them to be free from economic motivations.
