<p>Holy schlaMOLY, making out in a car is sodomy?  Oh dear.  Fleeing the
<br>
great state of Florida at age 19 was the right thing for me after all.  {8^D
<br>
<p>Regarding public nudity, there is a prominent nude beach near where
<br>
I grew up, just north of Kennedy Space Center, Playalinda beach.
<br>
Harvey perhaps you have been there.  Turns out the nude beach
<br>
is on the north end, right where the road access ends.  One can
<br>
start there, hike north 15 miles on the beach to New Smyrna to the
<br>
next road access and have a friend pick one up there.  This is one
<br>
of the very few places left in the world where one can hike on a beach
<br>
for three or four hours and not see another human the entire time, even
<br>
on the most perfect beach weather days.  But the last thing one
<br>
will see after starting that hike and the first thing one will see at
<br>
the other end are countless naked people.  That would be fine,
<br>
except for the fact that the kinds of people who generally go nude
<br>
on the beach are exactly those who you would really prefer not to
<br>
see naked.  Ever.  Not even in ones worst nightmare.
<br>
<p>{Remember that old nightmare where you get to work and suddenly
<br>
discover you forgot to get dressed that morning?  Well, that fate
<br>
would be preferrable to seeing some of these yahoos halfway thru
<br>
the workday discovering that they had forgotten to dress after getting
<br>
outta the shower.}
<br>
<p>The local Baptists tried to make nakedness illegal at the beach.  Several
<br>
nudes began to show up in downtown Titusville, holding signs saying
<br>
&quot;Would you rather have us here, or out at the beach?&quot;
<br>
<p>The Baptists dropped their case.
