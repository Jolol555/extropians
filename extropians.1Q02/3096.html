<p><p>Indeed.  Since one is a set of self-perpetuating patterns that

include some changes it seems that being both is inescapable. 
<br>
Perhaps it is only when we try to slice ourselves into isolated 
<br>
segments rather than being and becoming that their seems to be 
<br>
an issue.

<p><p>Since you are in part a variety of possible becomings which

like you give up everything you are.  But you do have to let go

of your perhaps somewhat frozen notion of what &quot;you are&quot; in 
<br>
order to become something significantly different with acceptance.

past to have old solutions work are often mistaken.

<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;If we are ignorant of our roots, then humans will be dead meat puppets ...&quot;

<p><p>What are our roots?  Are they all in the past or do we

long as uploads or posthumans if we cling to tenaciously to

roots that no longer all or even much of what we are nourished

by or growing from.
