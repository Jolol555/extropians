<p>THE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL LAWS
<br>
Ding-Yu Chung
<br>
<p>In the vacuum universe model, the origin of physical laws comes from the 
<br>
cosmic
<br>
evolution of vacuum in four stages: the pre-universe vacuum, the void space, 
<br>
the
<br>
adjacent vacuum, and the empty space. The pre-universe is a vacuum with the
<br>
vacuum energy slightly below the Planck energy. The vacuum fluctuation of the
<br>
pre-universe vacuum results in pairs of supermembrane and anti-supermembrane
<br>
and the void space. The supermembrane pairs and the void space are 
<br>
self-organized
<br>
into the semi-stable pre-expanding universe consisting of the positive and 
<br>
the negative energy boundary 9-branes separated by the bulk space with the
<br>
positive energy pre-gravity and the negative energy pre-gravity. 
<br>
<p>The collapse and the bounce of the pre-expanding universe result in the mixed 
<br>
pre-expanding universe consisting of the boundary mixed 9-branes with the 
<br>
absorbed void space. When the absorbed void space is emitted, it becomes the 
<br>
adjacent vacuum as the added space, which brings about the expansion with 
<br>
zero vacuum energy. The
<br>
rupture of space by the superluminal inflation brings about the empty space 
<br>
as the
<br>
gap among particles.
<br>
<p>The emergence of the empty space brings about the big bang, cosmic radiation, 
<br>
observable elementary particles, all force fields, and quantum mechanics. The 
<br>
periodic table of elementary particles is constructed to account for all 
<br>
elementary particles and their masses in a good agreement with the observed 
<br>
values. The cosmic evolution of vacuum involves a cyclic universe.
<br>
<p>1. Introduction
<br>
<p>Before the universe, the pre-universe is a vacuum with the vacuum energy
<br>
slightly below the Planck energy. The vacuum fluctuation [1] of the 
<br>
pre-universe
<br>
vacuum generates pairs of eleven dimensional supermembrane and 
<br>
anti-supermembrane:
<br>
<p>the positive energy ten dimensional superstring with positive
<br>
energy pre-gravity and the negative energy superstring with negative energy 
<br>
pre-gravity. The energy of the supermembrane is equal to the Planck energy. 
<br>
During
<br>
the vacuum fluctuation, the concentration of energy to form the supermembrane
<br>
pairs generates the void space without the capability for the vacuum 
<br>
fluctuation.
<br>
<p>In the universe, like-gravity stays together, and opposite-superstrings (as
<br>
opposite-charges) stay together and annihilate each other. With this 
<br>
principle of
<br>
arrangement, the supermembrane pairs and the void space are self-organized
<br>
into the semi-stable pre-expanding universe, where the positive and the 
<br>
negative
<br>
energy boundary 9-branes (superstrings) are separated by the bulk space with 
<br>
the positive energy pre-gravity and the negative energy pre-gravity. 
<br>
<p>The pre-expanding universe has the same structure as the Horava-Witten model 
<br>
based on an eleven dimensional supergravity on a manifold with two 
<br>
ten-dimensional
<br>
boundaries
