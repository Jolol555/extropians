</em><br>
<p>Well, religion can be a contributing factor, but is not a causal one.
<br>
The most bigoted people in the US exist in those who have absolutely the
<br>
least amount of contact with those they hate (Idaho, Compton, Harlem,
<br>
for example), but this is not exclusively true either, since both
<br>
Vermont and NH are considered two of the whitest states in the country
<br>
and racist groups have great difficulty obtaining more than a dozen or
<br>
so adherents here. There is a sizable gay/lesbian population, and those
<br>
few minorities that do live here tend to rank above average on anybody's
<br>
scale, so the most bigoted some here will get is to be trapped in the
<br>
&quot;good n-----/bad n-----&quot; mindset.
<br>
<p>THis may be because people that live here are generally well travelled,
<br>
and have spent at least several years of life elsewhere, either in the
<br>
military or in college, where exposure to other lifestyles/ethnicities
<br>
tends to help ameliorate any latent prejudices. Thus, I think it is
<br>
degree of exposure that does help determine this. On the other hand,
<br>
I'll use the example of a cousin of mine who grew up in Nashua with a
<br>
diverse community and high school, went to college at Boston University
<br>
and became afraid he was becoming racist from living in Boston because
<br>
of so many negative experiences with blacks there.
<br>
<p>While many long time city dwellers will heap scorn upon openly stated
<br>
bigotry from the redneck types, I've known too many city dwellers who
<br>
are quite privately more bigoted, but unwilling to admit it.
<br>
<p>While prejudice against gays and lesbians is likely motivated by
<br>
religion, racial prejudice is more likely created by the lingering
<br>
socio-economic strife that is perpetuated in every negative interracial
<br>
act that occurs. The difficulty in this ballet of trust and distrust is
<br>
that every negative action offsets ten positive ones.
