...Great. As someone who put myself through BS/MS/PhD Physics, I would
<br>
have been happy to have this kind of support. :-) I would donate to
<br>
such a program too. Maybe we can change things for the next
<br>
generation.
<br>
<p>This is an *excellent* idea.  Indeed, over the past four years I have paid 
<br>
for a young woman's college education, someone not related to me or even 
<br>
known to me personally (at first).  She was recommended by a trusted friend 
<br>
as having intelligence and willpower, but no money... so I supplied some.  
<br>
She is now graduated and (hopefully) on her way out of poverty.  I encourage 
<br>
other to do the same: Help people to help themselves.
<br>
<p>Talking about and planning the future is very important, but so is helping 
<br>
people in the *present*.
