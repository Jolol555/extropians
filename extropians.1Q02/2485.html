I just can't see how the Religious Right can continue to deny evolution
<br>
when presented with evidence like this:

<br>
<p>Further evidence below.

<p><em>&gt; &quot;In Speech, Bush Calls Iraq, Iran and North Korea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Axis of Evil&quot; -- N.Y.   Times, 1/30/02
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ANGERED BY SNUBBING, LIBYA, CHINA, SYRIA FORM AXIS  OF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; JUST AS EVIL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cuba, Sudan, Serbia Form Axis of Somewhat Evil;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bitter, Other Nations Start Own Clubs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Beijing (SatireWire.com) - Bitter after being snubbed for membership in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the   &quot;Axis of Evil,&quot; Libya, China, and Syria today announced they had formed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the   &quot;Axis of Just as Evil,&quot; which they said would be way eviler than that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid  Iran-Iraq-North Korea axis President Bush warned of his State of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Union
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   address.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Axis of Evil members, however, immediately dismissed the new axis as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having,  for starters, a really dumb name. &quot;Right. They are Just as Evil... in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their  dreams!&quot; declared North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. &quot;Everybody knows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the best evils... best at being evil... we're the best.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Diplomats from Syria denied they were jealous over being excluded,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although  they conceded they did ask if they could join the Axis of Evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;They told us it was full,&quot; said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;An Axis can't have more than three countries,&quot; explained Iraqi President
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Saddam Hussein. &quot;This is not my rule, it's tradition. In World War II you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   had Germany, Italy, and Japan in the evil Axis. So you can only have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three. And a secret handshake. Ours is wicked cool.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   THE AXIS PANDEMIC
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   International reaction to Bush's Axis of Evil declaration was swift, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within minutes, France surrendered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Elsewhere, peer-conscious nations rushed to gain triumvirate status in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what became a game of geopolitical chairs. Cuba, Sudan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Serbia said they had formed the Axis of Somewhat Evil, forcing Somalia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to join with Uganda and Myanmar in the Axis of Occasionally Evil, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bulgaria, Indonesia and Russia established the Axis of Not So Much Evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really As Just Generally Disagreeable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   With the criteria suddenly expanded and all the desirable clubs filling up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sierra Leone, El Salvador, and Rwanda applied to be called the Axis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Countries That Aren't the Worst But Certainly Won't Be Asked to Host the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Olympics; Canada, Mexico, and Australia formed the Axis of Nations That Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually Quite Nice But Secretly Have Nasty Thoughts About America, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spain, Scotland, and New Zealand established
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Axis of Countries That Ask Sheep to Wear Lipstick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;That's not a threat, really, just something we like to do,&quot; said Scottish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Executive First Minister Jack McConnell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   While wondering if the other nations of the world weren't perhaps making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun of him, a cautious Bush granted approval for most axes, although he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejected the establishment of the Axis of Countries Whose Names End in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Guay,&quot;  accusing one of its members of filing a false application. Officials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chadguay denied the charges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Israel, meanwhile, insisted it didn't want to join any Axis, but privately,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   world leaders said that's only because no one asked them.
