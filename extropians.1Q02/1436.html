</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very good post Kimberly.  I agree with you about the standards issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a non-issue.  Women can be as fit or more fit than their male
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterparts.  No question.  I will say that there aren't a whole lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women that can AND are willing to endure the physical hardships associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with infantry work.  But certainly as the various adventure races have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown the world in the last decade, there are women that have the strength
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and endurance to compete in harsh environments on an equal basis with men.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I've found in my experience that given a greater predeliction
<br>
toward beer guzzling in male soldiers, those females that do get into
<br>
shape retain their physical prime far better than the guys do over time.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (To give credit where due,  I also saw some awesome athletic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; performances--again from Marines of both genders.  There were men who could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vault over a six-feet fence like it wasn't there, and women who could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slither better than snakes under wire strung 6-inches above mud-pits.  Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seemed to do well on hills--men made better time when the surfaces were dry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and packed, but on the hill that was drenched by a fire hose, the women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; climbed faster on the rough, slippery surface.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is said, though I've not seen the scientific data to back it up, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of physiological differences, women can actually be better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shooters than men.
</em><br>
<p>It has to do with women having a different ratio of slow to fast twitch
<br>
muscle cells or some such, as well as better female receptivity to
<br>
training. For this reason, women have found that sniper/anti-sniper work
<br>
in wars is a very easy combat role to move into. There is one woman
<br>
Marine who has repeatedly won top standing at the National Matches at
<br>
Camp Perry, and women in general are very well represented there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's problematic to equate or evaluate the NVA in 1968 with the US Army
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.  No doubt many many NVA females served with distinction.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps some of the sexual tension issues didn't occur in NVA units or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurred to a lesser extent, or maybe they overcame them altogether.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know.  But we need to keep in mind that the NVA did not win in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnam due to their tactical superiority.  Pitched battles between NVA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and US Army or Marine units in Vietnam were rarely won by the NVA, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accounting for the technological superiority of the Americans.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition, the morale of US forces at the time was by many accounts a low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point in American military history, for a variety of reasons (none having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with men and women in the same combat units).  In spite of the low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morale, atrocious leadership, and flawed overall strategy, US forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routinely wreaked severe havoc on NVA units.  They won primarily because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were willing to sacrifice many many more of their people to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victory than the American people were.
</em><br>
<p>And they had a real propaganda machine willing to promulgate any lie,
<br>
and they didn't have a gullible national media as we did (for example,
<br>
Time Magazine's Saigon bureau chief was in fact an NVA intelligence
<br>
officer with the rank of Colonel, a fact Time continues to refuse to
<br>
acknowledge).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't intend any of these comments as arguments in favor of &quot;lowered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standards&quot; for women or as negations of the existence of &quot;special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; treatment&quot; in certain circumstances for women.  However, &quot;special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; treatment&quot; exists for guys too in the form of &quot;old boy's&quot; networks that let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unqualified males slide by.  Let's get rid of ALL of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.
</em><br>
<p>Of course. One phenomenon I found was abuse of the body capacitance
<br>
tests by overweight people. Use of this test is for those engaged in
<br>
body building/weight lifting activities when they exceed the weight
<br>
standards (the USAF actually has the most strict weight standards of all
<br>
services, since they want you to look sharp in the uniform rather than
<br>
actually be built for combat) to demonstrate you are actually 'in
<br>
shape'. The problem is that overweight long timers use calcium and other
<br>
mineral supplements to 'dope' themselves for such tests to create the
<br>
impression that more of their fat is actually bone mass.
<br>
<p>Consequently, you see airmen in desk jobs with beer bellies (women
<br>
included) rolling over their belts who pass, while some of the less
<br>
disciplined weight lifters end up failing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As a final note...the equal and rational application of standards would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely result in a great reduction in the number of women qualifying for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; traditional combat, and a great reduction in the number of men meeting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standards for submarine service and the ASTRONUAT PROGRAM.   Aside from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few jokes about Minsky's comment, and Spike's &quot;legless woman&quot; proposal, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see numerous outraged postings about sloppy performance by women in jobs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they shouldn't hold, but I see scant outrage on the list about &quot;standards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slide&quot; when it comes to men.  Why not?  As forced taxpayers, we certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get stuck with the bill for both classes of substandard performance. (Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fixing the space program might be an easier first step than fixing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And again, we are in complete agreement.
</em><br>
<p>No dispute here. Integration of blacks in the armed forces with no drop
<br>
in standards (and the fact that blacks who do join up tend to excel in
<br>
the military, I never had any problem with any black fellow I served
<br>
with, and would trust any of them with my life) demonstrates that
<br>
integration can be achieved if you demand the same level of excellence.
<br>
<p>The thing that concerns me with integrating women is that the phenomenon
<br>
cited by military people against full female integration, that males
<br>
would tend to coddle females rather than focus on combat, seems to be
<br>
systemically demonstrated in the prevelancy of dissimilar performance
<br>
standards for women. 
<br>
<p>I am of the opinion that women are fully capable of meeting the same
<br>
standards if they are expected to do so, and if they are mentally
<br>
determined to do so. One thing I learned in the military is that failure
<br>
to reach a goal is far more a matter of the individual conciously
<br>
choosing to fail rather than a lack of physical capacity to achieve the
<br>
requisite performance. None of us are ever really aware of what our true
<br>
limits are, the limits we perceive to exist are generally significantly
<br>
fudged by the subconcious desire to avoid pain and/or stress.
<br>
<p>I have seen women who were really not physically prepared for an ordeal,
<br>
but completed it anyways because they decided to the core of their
<br>
beings, that they were not going to quit. It is quite amazing what any
<br>
human can do when their minds are set on not failing. Childbirth, I
<br>
think, is an ordeal of this magnitude, and I'll bet you could easily
<br>
delineate military women of distinction and not by those who repeatedly
<br>
prefer and choose natural childbirth and those who scream for the
<br>
epidural at first opportunity. Of course, I'm just a guy saying this, so
<br>
what is that opinion worth, really?
<br>
<p>Perhaps the best thing that can improve the performance of women in the
<br>
military is some sort of psychological preparation program. 
<br>
<p>One phenomenon I noticed was that off duty, the guys were far more
<br>
likely to rent movies like 'Heartbreak Ridge' and 'Full Metal Jacket'
<br>
while the women went more for classically 'chick flicks'. Perhaps this
<br>
has some impact upon the mental state of the respective individuals, as
<br>
the best performing women I knew in uniform had no problem enjoying the
<br>
guy flicks as much as the guys.
