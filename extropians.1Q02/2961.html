<p>Oh my.
<br>
<p>Seriously though, an &quot;exowomb&quot; (not to be confused with an exo womb, 
<br>
ectopic pregnancy) with gestation in artificial wombs outside the human 
<br>
body will become a highly respectable alternative.  Health insurance 
<br>
companies could actually insist that women opt for the artificial way. 
<br>
Meanwhile, millions of females go through pregnancy with sapience.
<br>
<p>I think that we might not view pregnancy as bovine if we are emotionally 
<br>
attached to the person who is pregnant and have great love for the unborn 
<br>
child.  I think this is probably magnified if we experience life 
<br>
threatening situations which would affect the survival of the mother and 
<br>
child, and if we were to deliver the child from the birth canal and give 
<br>
him or her its first breaths of oxygen.
<br>
<p>Removing this ritual from humanity offers some consequences.
<br>
<p>Imagine if a couple of several individuals decide to produce offspring and 
<br>
it is produced without sexual intercourse and developed in an artificial 
<br>
exowomb.  In the long run, how might exowombing and mosaic birthing affect 
<br>
the biological relationship to the offspring and how might this affect the 
<br>
relationship of the people involved?
<br>
<p>Eventually biological hereditarianism will become unacceptable.
