<p>This quote is wrong.  It should be &quot;...things, that's 
<br>
[deciding what to keep] a straightforward process...&quot;.
<br>
Creativity itself is mixing information you have to create
<br>
new combinations.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Nothing could be easier than cranking out avantguard music or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a mistake.
</em><br>
<p>It's true that deciding what parts to throw away is easier when
<br>
there are fewer rules, or, at least, that no one can say you got it
<br>
wrong in such a case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, show me a program that can crank out mainstream children's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories or even pornography and I'll show you a sentient program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't demand the stories be particularly good just that the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not suspected of being retarded of psychotic.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree greatly that the act of writing a story requires a person.
<br>
I do think it is more likely that a person will write an interesting story.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      &gt;How, exactly, did you learn that animals (which, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;for some primates, can't let you know directly) are aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; themselves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing can let you know directly they are aware of themselves, so how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did I know they were conscious? I guessed, just as I guessed that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are sentient and that I am not the only conscious being in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>But since they aren't providing the cues that I am (e.g., they aren't 
<br>
holding conversations about conversations with you), I'd like to know
<br>
what evidence you have that they really are aware of themselves in
<br>
a way that, for instance, a rock isn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; Response is not self-awareness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I strongly disagree.
</em><br>
<p>Are you prepared to assert the self-awareness of a plant that
<br>
turns its leaves toward light?  It's having a chemical and physical
<br>
response to its surroundings.
