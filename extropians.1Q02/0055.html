<em>&gt; Fundamental mistake number 2 is to ignore the cultural background of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. Peanut butter in food packets for example, with written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instructions in several western languages. (1) Afghans don't know peanut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; butter, nor is it a usefull food for starving people. (2) 48% of the men
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 78% of the women are illiterate. (3) There're a dozen or so different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages in that country.
</em><br>
<p>Not all problems have solutions (find all the roots of a fifth order equation).
<br>
<p>The airdrops were a gesture, like cradling a deer's head in your lap after
<br>
you hit it with your car. Not meaningless, but not directly very effective.
<br>
<p>Spend months tooling up to produce packages in the correct languages
<br>
and people do without that food for that time. Producing the &quot;correct&quot; food
<br>
would take a year or more. It's a no-win given the specific circumstances. 
<br>
<p>The US could get into the &quot;relief food&quot; business in a big way, though, and
<br>
even one libertarian-leaning think tank has suggested something of the sort.
<br>
<p>US foreign policy can't get un-fucked-up in one administration's term. I hope it
<br>
can improve through the next decade or two.
<br>
<p>ObExtro:
<br>
New drop bags should be designed with voice output, mass downloaded before drop. 
<br>
This of course could mean that people with guns will hear the peanut-butter 
<br>
whispering and take the food away from the hungry...
<br>
<p>&lt;sarcasm&gt;
<br>
I know! Let's import a numerical majority of civilized Europeans as permanent
<br>
residents! Then the fighting will magically stop because they're so civilized!
<br>
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

 MMB&lt;==butler a t comp - lib . o r g   Wm. Burroughs said it best: &quot;After a shooting 
    spree, they always want to take the guns away from the people who didn't do it.&quot;
  I am not here to have an argument. I am here as part of a civilization. And you?
