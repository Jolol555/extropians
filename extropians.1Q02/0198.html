<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Here in Chicago, handguns are completely illegal and have been for 20 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the logic of the antigun folks, Chicago should by now be completely free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of handguns and violent crimes like murder should be non-existent. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian, I can think of a few reasons why Chicago's crime situation is so bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         1.      Whilst the availability of guns in Chicago has become more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult, it is no difficulty for a determined individual, particularly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal, to simply cross state lines &amp; purchase a gun in a state with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lax ownership &amp; sales restrictions. Gun restrictions will only really work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they are applied on a federal (or better yet international) level.
</em><br>
<p>Yet there are federal gun restrictions which prevent such acts as you
<br>
describe. It is a federal felony to purchase a gun from a dealer in a
<br>
state in which you are not a resident. It is also a federal felony for
<br>
anyone to sell a gun to someone who is a felon.
<br>
<p>The fact is that MOST of the gun violence that occurs in Chicago happens
<br>
at the behest of Mayor Richard Daley and his police force, since most
<br>
guns used in crime in Chicago have been found to have been sold to
<br>
criminals BY the police, illegally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Piece-meal approaches to gun restriction only seem to favour those who will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use such weapons for nefarious purposes.
</em><br>
<p>As demonstrated by the rise in gun crime in Britain and Japan and
<br>
Australia, broad sweeping gun bans only favor those who have no respect
<br>
for the law to begin with, and penalize those who are already law
<br>
abiding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         2.      The current US system of plea-bargaining seems to favour the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more hardened criminal. Example: a street level dealer (or &quot;runner&quot;) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrested. It is highly unlikely that he will have worthwhile information on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his superiors &amp; it is unlikely that he will be able to effect much change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his charges by plea bargaining. Someone higher up the chain is arrested &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they have more details on the overall supply system, they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively plea bargain a more serious supply charge away in exchange for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that information. This is one of the reasons that the majority of people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jail for drug offences (for example) are in for relatively minor offences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (mandatory &quot;3 strikes&quot; sentencing doesn't help much either), &amp; the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sharks are still out in the community, doing maximum harm.
</em><br>
<p>I thought we were talking about gun laws, not drug laws. The fact is
<br>
that pro-gunners instituted Operation Exile in Richmond, VA to require
<br>
minimum mandatory 5 year federal sentences for any felon caught with a
<br>
gun, no plea bargains allowed. Violent crime dropped by 65% in one year
<br>
in that city following institution of this project. The anti-gun
<br>
liberals refuse to allow this practice to be imposed in the cities they
<br>
control, thus they perpetuate the high violence of democrat controlled
<br>
big cities, and are thus accessories to mass murder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot claim to know what the best solution to the guns/crime problem in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US. The issues involved are difficult, the pressure from various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest groups so intense &amp; the size of the problem so large, that no easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution presents itself. To my mind the gun availability issue plays a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major role in the problems that the US faces, however it is only one of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues that will need to be addressed if the US is to curb the horrific rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of  violent crime that afflicts the majority of the united states.
</em><br>
<p>Guns are a scapegoat, nothing more. The fact is, since a majority of
<br>
states passed 'shall-issue' concealed weapons laws in the early 1990's,
<br>
violent crime has dropped in the US by 60%. In the same period, nations
<br>
with restrictive gun bans, like Britain, Australia, and Japan, have all
<br>
seen double digit increases each year in various violent crime
<br>
categories.
<br>
<p>If guns were the problem, Vermont would have the highest crime rate in
<br>
the world. Instead, it has one of the lowest. End of story.
<br>
<p>I don't expect to have to repeat this debate with you on this list. I
<br>
did create the exi-freedom list on yahoogroups for the purpose of
<br>
debating various freedom issues, like guns, which many extropians list
<br>
members find repetetive and old hat.
