<em>&gt;I'm not sure what you're trying to say motivates those who oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change.  Do you mean that they expect the average affect of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change to be negative, or that they expect particular people to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negatively affected?  (I think we agree that particular people will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;often be negatively affected.)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I meant that the effects on particular people are their main motivation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Clearly there are some opponents with each view.  Since you suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacking luddites as selfish, you must believe that the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;affect of (particular) changes is positive.  Do you think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;luddites understand this?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;No, it is normal for people's opinions to be biased by their self-interest,
<br>
and the evidence for the positive effects is generally not compelling
<br>
enough to offset those biases. They see us as similarly biased.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Or is the point that the general public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be convinced that the general affect is positive enough that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular harms can be offset or neglected?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;My main hope is that we can reduce the frequency with which the public
<br>
gets fooled into treating self-interested policies as altruistic policies.
<br>
Convincing the public that they don't know what the net effects are will
<br>
often be more practical than convincing them that the net effects are positive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Every time I think about the negative externalities that &quot;Luxury
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fever&quot; discussed, it looks like they only affect those who buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into the comparative scale of wealth.  I don't see that I've done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something extraordinary in order to feel immune to this competition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so it looks to me like an externality that anyone can opt out of.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I see signs that people who are relatively wealthy, or who have succeeded
<br>
at some other form of status competition, can opt out. I don't know how to
<br>
tell how hard it is for people with low status can opt out.
<br>
&nbsp;I presume there are some important benefits to encouraging people to choose
<br>
to care about the kinds of status they are most likely to achieve, rather
<br>
than feeling pressure to use the most popular measures of status.
