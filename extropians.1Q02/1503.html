<em>&gt;I was in general unimpressed by the arguments of &quot;Luxury Fever&quot;.  I agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many people are driven by envy and care about relative standing.  I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that that gives the argument moral weight.  Some people are doing very well at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improving the lives of others, and they're being compensated very well for it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;A society in which a large fraction of rewards go to a handful of people
<br>
who become the best tennis player or the best movie star is a society in
<br>
which in which a large number of people take big risks to become one of that
<br>
handful, and it is a society in which most of the people who make that
<br>
attempt fail to achieve what they want.
<br>
&nbsp;In a society in which rewards are much more dispersed, a larger fraction
<br>
of people are able to accomplish what they attempt.
<br>
&nbsp;That's why the arguments in Luxury Fever imply that there are negative
<br>
externalities associated with celebrity-worship. Since I don't see any way
<br>
to internalize those externalities, I therefore believe that a moral system
<br>
which creates social pressure to make choices that reduce inequality will
<br>
produce a nicer society than a moral system that claims inequality doesn't
<br>
matter. Most of the choices that affect inequality aren't as simple as
<br>
choosing whether to worship celebrities, but that doesn't make them any
<br>
less important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's why life is so much better for everyone, including the worst off.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Everyone? Do you deny that there are people who have lost their job
<br>
security due to economic change? Do you deny that there are people whose
<br>
pristine view of lake Tahoe has become less valuable because someone else
<br>
became wealthy enough to build another house within that view?
<br>
&nbsp;The economic progress that I observe looks like some people (often a large
<br>
majority) benefitting from an innovation while others lose something as a
<br>
result. It's hard to explain the widespread controversy over policies that
<br>
promote economic progress unless I notice the existence of people who are
<br>
hurt by such progress.
