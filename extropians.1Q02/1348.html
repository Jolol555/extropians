<em>    &gt; There is no contradiction in confirming sentience via interacting with others.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; The operative word is *interacting* -- the level of intelligence is secondary.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, intelligence is not important, you can interact with a rock, thus rocks are
<br>
sentient.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;intelligence implies &quot;consciousness&quot; in the same way that fire implies
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&quot;phlogiston.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I know for a fact that when I'm not conscious I'm not intelligent either and
<br>
it seems reasonable that things that I can not interact INTELLIGENTLY with,
<br>
like rocks, are not conscious, so I ask again, what is it about this that made
<br>
you &quot;laugh out loud&quot;? I can only figure you know I'm wrong because you're
<br>
very intelligent when you're asleep or because you talk to conscious rocks.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;&gt;&gt;My old z80 is slower by a magnitude than a P4, but is not a jot more
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt;&gt;or less sentient!
</em><br>
<p><em>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>      &gt;&gt; You seem very sure, how did you find out?
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt; That's easy: They both failed to claim that they are sentient.
</em><br>
<p>I never claimed to be sentient, do you think I am? As a matter of fact I am not.
<br>
It's a little embarrassing to admit it but I'm handicapped. When I was 3 years old
<br>
I fell off my tricycle and hit my head, I wasn't badly hurt physically but it rendered
<br>
me permanently non-sentient. I think I've done a good job overcoming my disability,
<br>
I do pretty well on IQ tests, I earn a good living, I have friends, I laugh and cry just
<br>
like anybody else, in fact I've done such a good job overcoming my handicap that
<br>
nobody ever guesses that I'm no more conscious than a rock. When I was
<br>
younger I assumed I was the only human in this condition but now that I come
<br>
to think (thinking has nothing to do with consciousness remember) about it,
<br>
if somebody else was as good at this charade as I am there would be
<br>
no way I could tell.
<br>
<p>Perhaps there are even people who are non-sentient but don't know it, they
<br>
think they know what consciousness is, but really it's like the difference
<br>
between a firefly and a supernova, they have no hint of the immense and
<br>
glorious feeling of sentience that most other people have. This is all
<br>
speculation of course, I wouldn't know anything about it, as I said I'm
<br>
smart as a whip but no more conscious than a rock. I envy you conscious
<br>
beings.
