There has been some interesting modelling of hallucinatory patterns by
<br>
Bard Ermentrout at University of Pittsburgh
<br>
(<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~phase/">http://www.pitt.edu/~phase/</a>) and Paul Bressloff at Loughborough
<br>
University (<a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/ma/staff/pcb/">http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/ma/staff/pcb/</a>). 
<br>
<p>The idea is that drugs produce disinhibition in the visual cortex, which
<br>
leads to pattern formation. The fun thing is that you can model this
<br>
essentially as an ordinary reaction-diffusion system (there is a local
<br>
nonlinear interaction between excitation and inhibition, and they
<br>
diffuse with slightly different diffusion constants) which produces
<br>
spots, lines, hexagons and all the other usual patterns you see in
<br>
nonlinear science textbooks across the virtual cortex. 
<br>
<p>But since there is a nonlinear map between our visual field and the
<br>
cortex, a straight line of cortical activity would not appear to us as a
<br>
straight line, but a spiral. Paul showed that the most likely patterns
<br>
also correspond well to many common hallucinations, and when they moved
<br>
many common animated hallucinations appear. More complex interactions
<br>
between direction sensitive cells produce spiderweb patterns and so on.
<br>
Very elegant models.
<br>
<p>It seems likely that since we all share the same basic visual hardware,
<br>
its modes of instability and resonance would affect us across culture,
<br>
especially during early childhood when the developing visual system
<br>
seems extra unstable. Many such phenomena are likely useful - the
<br>
spontaneous waves across the retina during fetal development are
<br>
believed to train the visual cortex for example.
