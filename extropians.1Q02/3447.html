<p><em>&gt; Fast forward to the late 1990's, after a couple decades of sustained growth

<p>Great post James!  Thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (For those interested, the State
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Nevada has sustained an average 5% annual population growth for decades,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the highest in the nation, due primarily to an intentionally favorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic climate; everything is cheap, taxes are comparatively non-existent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and regulatory red tape is kept to a bare minimum.  Not bad for a State that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people think of as a desert wasteland.)...
</em><br>
<p>Here's something that may surprise those who have never seen it:
<br>
Nevada is one of the most scenic states in the lower 48.  I would
<br>
put it in the top 3.  They never sell that much in their tourist
<br>
brochures, only the gambling and legal harlotry.  But Nevada has
<br>
much more to offer than that, so much more.  If you ever see
<br>
one of those pictures of the US from space, notice the area which
<br>
is Nevada: mountain range after mountain range, like grand
<br>
ripples on a massive sea.
<br>
<p>Vacation hint: fly to Reno, rent a car, drive across highway 50
<br>
to Ely, turn north to Elko, drive west to Battle Mountain, take 305
<br>
all the way down to Tonopah and head back toward Reno.  Skip
<br>
the casinos and the whores, see what the great state of Nevada
<br>
is really about.  As a bonus, Nevada is second only to Alaska in
<br>
being libertarian.  spike
