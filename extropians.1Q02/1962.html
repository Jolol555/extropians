<em>&gt; Particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with regard to Eugene's comments.  Most of the time he gets my vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the most obscure, condensed poster on the list (of course I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view myself clearly -- the recent exchange with Louis suggests that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could very well fall into that swamp myself).  I am generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left looking at his comments questioning whether I really understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them -- and most of the time I think our relative knowledge bases are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty similar -- which makes my confusion sometimes even stranger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would write it off to cultural differences but I of all people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list have at least some overlap with Eugene's cultural background.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the source of this remains a mystery to me.  So viewing Eugene's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments as an enigma wrapped inside a riddle boxed within a puzzle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not a new situation.
</em><br>
<p><p>I understand Eugene perfectly when he posts.  He just posts with an
<br>
extremely high signal-to-noise ratio and context compression that most
<br>
people aren't used to.  Though if you are not familiar with the topic he is
<br>
talking about, you will almost certainly be lost without spending quite a
<br>
bit of time on Google.
<br>
<p>A lot of the apparent compression when Eugene writes is caused by the
<br>
assumption of a high degree of shared context.  If you share much of the
<br>
context that he is using, most of what he writes is comes through very
<br>
clearly.  If you have insufficient context for what he writes, you'll
<br>
probably be confused.  I personally kind of enjoy the extreme efficiency of
<br>
information transmission that is his style.  But then, I understand what he
<br>
is talking about most of the time.
