</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;hibernating andy&quot;, where he advocates cryonics more as an &quot;esthetic&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice than a &quot;scientific&quot; one..
</em><br>
<p>I think he believed in the concept of cryonics and the potential for 
<br>
technology to advance in such a way that would make cryonics a reliable 
<br>
choice.  He wanted an alternative the status quo concept of death and the 
<br>
romantic hoopla that goes along with death and dying.  I do think he used 
<br>
the idea of cryonics as a media statement, as you suggest.  I think it was 
<br>
an aesthetic, artistic, literary, scientific, and moral choice. (Plus some 
<br>
others that he would attest.)
<br>
<em>&gt;  But as far as I know (just from various readings), Leary was &quot;fired&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Cryocare, that's just after this event, that, apparently disgusted, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he refused Alcor's offer to take him back, was it not what happened?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Remi
</em><br>
<p>He did have an argument with a couple of Cryocare folks and it resulted in 
<br>
their decision.  Tim didn't follow all the correct protocol and  for any 
<br>
cryonics organization, I would think that it is consequential to follow 
<br>
such protocol.  Tim liked to party, explore, express and demonstrate.  He 
<br>
may have wanted his suspension to just happen and work, not to go through 
<br>
the dying process, suspension team, paperwork, expenses, etc.
<br>
<p>When the Cryocare decision was made, Alcor did not move quickly 
<br>
enough.  This was very disappointing.  I regret my not having established 
<br>
an extropian camp at his house and pushed out the deathists.  But things 
<br>
are not always that easy.  Other issues filter in such as dignity and not 
<br>
wanting to force one's views on others.  Herein lies the rub.  Should I or 
<br>
we have stood up to a Dalai Lama and folks surrounding his house, *or not* 
<br>
be one of the Timothy Leary-mongers *and let* him make his own decision 
<br>
based on his needs at the time?  Should, should, should, should.  Who 
<br>
knows.  But one thing that does stand out is that loosing one life of a 
<br>
friend is so deeply tragic that all must be done to preserve the positive 
<br>
reputation of cryonics and to try to always act with dignity.
