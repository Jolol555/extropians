<p>Assuming, singularities are real, there are two classes of them: those

<p>Assuming, you can't make those (presumably, requiring devices on stellar

If you can make them, and homeostate their mass by feeding them (with

worthless stuff such as iron, for instance) they're very handy do

catalytically convert any matter according to E=mc^2 into Hawking

blackbody radiation.

<p>At least in this solar system, the output of the Sun is insufficient to

drive computation of devices constructed from mass outside of the star.

other, yet hypothetical power sources) to make use of all the rest of the
