<p><p>There is no necessity that fiat currencies implode.  Mismanagement HAS
<br>
caused a large number of fiat currencies to crash, but it isn't an intrinsic
<br>
property of fiat currencies and there are a few currencies around the world
<br>
that have long histories of being relatively well-managed.  In this light,
<br>
it may be better to evaluate currencies like you would evaluate so-called
<br>
value stocks, by looking at their management history and guessing whether or
<br>
not that historical management trend will continue.
<br>
<p>As a separate issue, gold is not generally a good investment (nor are most
<br>
mined commodities these days).  Ignoring fluctuations caused by political
<br>
concerns and a weakening perception of its &quot;intrinsic value&quot;, there is the
<br>
problem of it being not nearly as rare as it used to be.  There is a
<br>
continuing problem where production capacity has outstripped demand such
<br>
that the current spot price is barely over the cost of production from the
<br>
most profitable mines.  In terms of supply and demand, it is far more
<br>
appropriate to treat gold as something manufactured rather than as something
<br>
that is intrinsically scarce.  For all practical purposes, we have the
<br>
capacity to produce as much gold as the market needs at relatively low
<br>
prices, even if the demands of the market rise dramatically.
