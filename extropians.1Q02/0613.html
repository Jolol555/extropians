<p>I've found myself walking on eggshells with this issue for quite some time,
<br>
as a linguistics student beginning to study American Sign Language, and
<br>
very much sympathetic towards the possibility of technological
<br>
enhancements.  I saw &quot;Sound and Fury&quot; last year at the fine Tower Theater
<br>
in Sacramento, and was very much impressed by it both for its intense drama
<br>
and its relatively great impartiality.  There are so many conceptual paths
<br>
I have gone down here, so I'll try to mention a few of the most important.
<br>
<p>1) The acquistion of full fluency in a natural language (spoken/signed) in
<br>
an appropriate neurological timeframe is tremendously important in general
<br>
cognitive development.  While the technical glitches of current cochlear
<br>
implants might not be very dangerous if they were used to restore your or
<br>
my lost hearing, they invariably hamper the early linguistic development of
<br>
infants, who cannot give feedback about nor consciously understand the
<br>
important ways in which their sensory input is abnormal.  Cognitively, the
<br>
best situation for a deaf infant, by far, is to acquire a signed language
<br>
with full native fluency and then, once they have that platform of
<br>
linguistic thought, to begin acquiring skills in secondary languages.
<br>
Unfortunately, the well-established dependence of cognition upon language
<br>
has been overlooked by the elementary educators who far outnumber linguists
<br>
and developmental psychologists, and whose primary concern is literacy and
<br>
sometimes communication.  These people fail to see internal language
<br>
deficiency as a serious problem because their daily exposure is to children
<br>
who are not prevented from developing natural fluency.
<br>
<p>2) Far from being an extropian advocacy of personal augmentation, the
<br>
support for cochlear implants is so appealing to so many because it returns
<br>
the &quot;abnormal&quot; to a state of &quot;normalcy&quot;, in other words, it's not regarded
<br>
as augmentation but as healing.  As extropians, we may (rightly) tend to
<br>
blur this distinction, but for the rest of the world it's pretty damn
<br>
important.  Why else the outrage over cosmetic surgery when it changes a
<br>
face from the &quot;natural&quot; form to a prettier one, but not when it removes an
<br>
acquired scar or brings extremely divergent facial features closer to the
<br>
mean?
<br>
<p>3) All of us, everyday, trade off possible enhancements of our personal
<br>
abilities for sociological goals.  Compared to the sociological goals
<br>
behind the deaf community's opposition to cochlear implants, our goals are
<br>
trivial.  Their sociological goals include fluent communication between
<br>
parents and children, and maintance of a community wherein they are not
<br>
perpetually assumed to be mentally retarded, while our major goal is
<br>
probably not wanting to look like a dork.
