</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may hypothesize that pre-monotheist creeds have existed for tens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tousands years or more before. (see below for some supporting arguments)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So OK, writing didn't instantly produce monotheism, but maybe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; started/boosted a cultural process which in turn begat monotheism (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Plato), which begat atheism (and materialism) -- which will beget the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Singularity (maybe!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see it as a fairly linear world view development (no offence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intended to religious people), in which writing is just instrumental.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Not &quot;linear&quot; as opposed to exponentional of course.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What evidence is there for this kind of development? There are certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of cultural processes that are going on, how can we chack if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes we have experienced have been necessary (or likely) results of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preconditions such as writing, or just how it happened?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not quite agree that writing would lead to monotheism - just look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at China, where writing has been very prevalent but no major monotheist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions have originated. I'm also unaware of any evidence for ancient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-monotheisms, unless one assumes the seed to be the remote high gods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in many nature religions.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. The problem here is the assumption of a continuous, linear model of
<br>
development. I'm very sceptical about that-certainly it needs to be
<br>
supported rather than assumed. Also, there's an implicit assumption that
<br>
monotheism is more &quot;advanced&quot; than or grows out of polytheism. I think that
<br>
is simply an assumption (with all sorts of baggage in it). Steve Davies
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The issue isn't really religion here (although that is interesting), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather the determinism of history. Will the invention of the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitabily lead to the Internet and global freedom of information? Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the introduction of writing lead to monotheisms? Will the introduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of agriculture lead to the singularity? These are very relevant issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider.
</em><br>
<p>I think all of the evidence is against a determinist model of history so my
<br>
answer to all of these points is no, not necessarily. SD
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I would really like to know what happend 500-400 BCE - look at the
</em><br>
number
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of extremely influential philosophers suddenly popping up worldwide;
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;important greek ones in the West, Sun Tzu, Confucius, Buddha etc. Why
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;many at this time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe just because of some maturation stage consequent to the start of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; writing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why in such a short time? Remember that the societies they lived in had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had writing for very different times and used very different writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems.
</em><br>
<p>If I remember correctly, this was first pointed out by Jaspers, who coined
<br>
the term &quot;Axial Age&quot; for this period. The fact that this happened suddenly
<br>
suggests that there was a &quot;concatenation of circumstances&quot; (as Jeeves would
<br>
say) around that time. One would be the appearance of trans-Eurasian trade
<br>
routes at this time. Another important factor would be the emergence of a
<br>
new kind of political system in the Middle East (the Persian Empire of Cyrus
<br>
and Darius) which among other things makes this linkage possible. Of course
<br>
it may be that we are retrospectively seeing pattern where there is none-the
<br>
historicity of some of these people is open to doubt. SD
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The big question is: how deterministic is history? We can be certain it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not entirely deterministic - the tyfoon saving Japan from Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invasion was in the end due to sensitive dependency on initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions. We can also be certain it is not entirely random - as Jared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diamond pointed out in _Guns, Germs and Steel_ there are noticeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns in how different civilizations have evolved over huge amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time and great geographical separation. Is there any way we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decribe the exact amount of determinism? It is not so much a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantitative issue as a qualitative one.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely, this is one of the *big* questions with a lot of bearing on how
<br>
we view our own situation today. I tend towards a less deterministic model
<br>
myself but I do think institutions are enormously important and they can be
<br>
very hard to change. Steve Davies
