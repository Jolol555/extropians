</em><br>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out.  I forget how this stuff is portrayed to
<br>
mainstream America.
<br>
<p>Just to set the record straight:  Gays do not want domestic partners laws.
<br>
These were invented as a diversion to keep gays from getting regular
<br>
marriages.  In Vermont, for example, gays really don't get the same kind of
<br>
marriage.  The laws are separate, the terms are different, the forms are
<br>
different, the procedures for dissolving it are different.  Contrary to
<br>
confusing claims, gays cannot get married anywhere in the U.S.  The
<br>
misleading claim that gays can marry in Vermont just makes it harder for
<br>
them to push for equal marriage rights in that state.
<br>
<p>Similarly, gays never wanted &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policies in the
<br>
military.  This was invented by conservatives.  It is effectively a gag
<br>
order on gays that says if anyone finds out you're gay you will be kicked
<br>
out.  This is worse than the previous situation where they had to prove
<br>
illegal sexual conduct in a military court-martial.  Now, a person who
<br>
&quot;thinks they are gay&quot; without ever acting on it can be kicked out, and is
<br>
presumed guilty unless they challenge in court and prove they are not gay.
<br>
This is worse than what the situation was before.  Although it has been
<br>
portrayed in the conservative media as an example of gay rights, it actually
<br>
was fought by gays and is considered by gays to be a reduction in rights.
<br>
<p>Personally, I feel any gay-rights law or any law that specifically mentions
<br>
gays to be flawed.  We need to apply laws generically to all people.  Having
<br>
special laws or procedures for gays gets into the &quot;separate but equal&quot;
<br>
fallacy.  Imagine if we literally interpreted the constitution's references
<br>
to &quot;All Men...&quot; as excluding women, and started writing a separate bill of
<br>
rights that applied to women.  This would create a second-class citizen
<br>
status with separate laws.  I think all laws, if they exist at all, should
<br>
be generic.  No employment discrimination on ANY basis not job-related.  No
<br>
housing discrimination on ANY basis not tenet-related.  Partnerships,
<br>
beneficiaries, inheritance laws should apply to ANY person the deceased
<br>
chooses to list as a preferred survivor.  Applying laws evenly and fairly to
<br>
everyone makes a lot more sense than trying to write new laws for every
<br>
single case that might arise.
