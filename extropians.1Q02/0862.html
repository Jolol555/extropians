<p>
Some comments related to Spike's comments.
<br>
<p>The critical point Spike makes is the fact that stellar
<br>
civilizations don't go anywhere &quot;quickly&quot;.  There is a
<br>
big difference between &quot;colonizing&quot; at a milli-c vs. 0.1 c
<br>
(a figure typically used for interstellar travel).
<br>
You can go quickly in a small ship -- but then you are
<br>
a &quot;seed&quot; (perhaps with no qualms about returning to
<br>
steal the resources of the parent).  If you go as
<br>
the entire civilization (so you maintain internal trust
<br>
levels), you travel by the slow boat.  This *significantly*
<br>
impacts any thoughts that the galaxy should appear &quot;colonized&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, the inability to preserve trust relationships with &quot;seeds&quot;
<br>
*also* dictates ones behavior with regard to any civilization
<br>
*stupid* enough to allow seeds to be spread.  Since you know
<br>
that sooner or later you will have to deal with a weed-filled
<br>
garden the best thing you can do is stop them before they
<br>
spread very far.  Thus MBrains should have a scorched earth
<br>
policy with regard to seed spreading civilizations when they
<br>
are discovered.
<br>
<p>You have to keep in mind the problem of the lack of &quot;current&quot;
<br>
information. If you assume that the time of development of
<br>
civilizations to time of the singularity is ~2000-5000 years,
<br>
then its clear that we don't have a clue what is currently going
<br>
on in most of the Galaxy.  We are ~24,000 l.y from the center,
<br>
never mind the other side.
<br>
<p>You can never know what the &quot;reality&quot; is outside of a very
<br>
local region of space.  So chasing after a star 10 l.y. away
<br>
may make sense.  Chasing after a star 100 l.y. away is iffy.
<br>
Chasing after a star 1000 l.y. away seems really silly --
<br>
you have no way of assuring it will still be there when you
<br>
finally arrive.
<br>
<p>One point that wasn't clear to me from Spike's post was
<br>
what the point was of going to another system.  You can't
<br>
harvest material from the stars quickly.  So the only thing
<br>
you can do is rip off the planetary material.  If the universe
<br>
is in that condition we would expect to find regions of space
<br>
where there are clusters of stars that &quot;should&quot; have planets
<br>
but don't (as the MBrains migrate outward in orbits plucking
<br>
the apples from an everwidening circle of trees).  This is a
<br>
relatively solid prediction -- when we can do large exoplanet
<br>
surveys (e.g. the Kepler mission) if we find regions of stars
<br>
that are missing planets then MBrain activity is one reason
<br>
to consider (stellar near-misses being another possibility).
<br>
<p>It looks to me like advanced civilizations should be able to
<br>
detect MBrains.  You can see them either by their microlensing
<br>
signatures or slight variations in the background temperature.
<br>
*But* such signatures are always &quot;past&quot; signatures.  How accurately
<br>
they reflect reality depends on their distance.  If its under the
<br>
control of an &quot;intelligence&quot; any information about where it &quot;was&quot; gives
<br>
you little predictive power of where it &quot;currently&quot; is (within laws of
<br>
physics limitations regarding changes in velocity and direction of
<br>
course).
<br>
<p>The maximum amount of material - millions of stars worth is
<br>
going to be in large gas clouds (the question is is it cheaper
<br>
to collect it there than extracting it from a stellar gravity well).
<br>
If efficient ways to collect material in gas clouds can be devised,
<br>
then MBrains feed off those rather than stars.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that MBrains don't have to &quot;fight&quot; -- not at this stage
<br>
of development in the Universe.  There are lots of brown dwarfs to feed
<br>
on.  But if MBrains can detect other MBrains and if one subscribes to
<br>
the &quot;fighting&quot; scenario, one would want to avoid any region of space
<br>
another MBrain could reach by the time you could get there.  As the
<br>
MBrain population of a galaxy  increases, it would seem that would
<br>
require expanding outward occupying an increasing volume of space
<br>
around the galaxy.
<br>
<p>All this would seem to dictate an evolutionary strategy.
<br>
When resources are abundant, you can afford to be a
<br>
large slow MBrain and take your time getting to the
<br>
next gas station.  But as resources diminish and become
<br>
increasingly less dense -- you have to be able to
<br>
get there faster.  That would require that you have
<br>
an increasingly less mass (so you can accelerate,
<br>
decelerate and alter course more quickly).  Unless there
<br>
is some breakthrough to subatomic engineering that suggests
<br>
to me that in the long run advanced civilizations will
<br>
be required to shed matter (and therefore memory and
<br>
intelligence).  Alternatively one can consume the resources
<br>
more slowly, presumably spending much of your time in
<br>
suspend mode.
<br>
<p>You can obviously move to locations where the matter
<br>
density is high such as galactic centers, but this
<br>
would seem to be a counterproductive strategy because
<br>
you are eventually going to get sucked into black holes
<br>
that are growing much faster than they are evaporating
<br>
(at least at this stage of the Universe).  You can of
<br>
course get away from them -- but only by expending
<br>
a significant fraction of your resources.
<br>
<p>Thus the really long term prospects for SIs do not appear
<br>
to be very good to me at this point (unless you want to
<br>
invoke magic physics).
