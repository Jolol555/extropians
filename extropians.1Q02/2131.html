<em>   &gt;&gt; Gregory Bateson used to say, I think, that intelligence basically was
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>   &gt;&gt; ability to find the pattern that connects two objects or events. I'm
</em><br>
curious
<br>
<em>   &gt;&gt; why we've had so little luck devising programs that can do this.
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;William Calvin would probably argue that it derives from the
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;interaction of two thought patterns overlapping one another
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;in the brain.
</em><br>
<p>And I'd argue that for the purposes of this discussion the two statements
<br>
are functionally the same. Both are metaphors. Subjectively there's no
<br>
difference between anobject or event and a thought pattern about that object
<br>
or event. But either way I think we understand each other.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;Be careful -- there is probably a selection effect in that &quot;Westerners&quot;
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;may have been higher levels of novelty-seeking genes.  We discussed
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;this on the list a couple of months ago.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I only just rejoined the list (had to quit because of the high volume
<br>
of email!). But assuming it's proven that such genes actually exist (I'd be
<br>
ready instantly to agree the presence of cultural memes deriving from
<br>
innovations in the keeping-my-ass-warm field), does it make much difference
<br>
why, if the strategy consistently wins in the paradigm of social games we're
<br>
currently playing? Novelty and innovation aren't that different, after all.
<br>
<p>BTW are there archives anywhere? I'd be interested in reading up on why
<br>
novelty seeking would be prevelant in cultures of European descent.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;The problem is -- do they &quot;connect&quot; from a common sense perspective
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;of being innovative or useful or are they simply &quot;interesting&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;The connection of &quot;sad--cow&quot; generates an entirely different
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;pattern in my brain than the two patterns generated by &quot;mad--cow&quot;
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;which is different from the somewhat fuzzy &quot;cow--mad&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Not every innovation is practical, nor does it need to be in a market-driven
<br>
economy. Demand will simply weed out the crackpot inventors and leave the
<br>
really useful innovations. I'd go further and suggest that without some
<br>
inherent psychic encouragement that it's okay to come up with impractical
<br>
innovations, most of the practical ones wouldn't have come into existence.
<br>
It's statistics - make a hundred new ideas, one will be really useful, so
<br>
much so that the idea's value will exceed the expenditure of energy required
<br>
to come up with it.
<br>
<p>As an aside, in Singapore there's a word, &quot;kiasu,&quot; which signifies being
<br>
afraid to lose what you already have. Singaporeans joke that this is a
<br>
national characteristics, and it manifests as reticence, risk-aversion,
<br>
unwillingness to stick your neck out. The same pattern exists all over Asia
<br>
in varying degrees. But an unwillingness to appear foolish occasionally will
<br>
clearly obstruct a will to innovate.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, put a computer that can fail again and again, and at the
<br>
end of the process produce an innovative idea, into the hands of people who
<br>
don't intrinsically have the emotional or cultural wherewithal to do this
<br>
themselves, and innovation loses its excess value. Singapore becomes as good
<br>
as the US at designing software, making movies, inventing risky financial
<br>
instruments, and in order to maintain the Empire, the US has to move up a
<br>
level (to what?).
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;As someone's sig says, &quot;everything is easy once you know how to do it&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Right. And surely the notion that dumb luck in combination with an ability
<br>
to interpret unexpected results can be brought to bear. That's the point - a
<br>
computer that can generate possible connecting patterns (or, okay,
<br>
overlapping ideas) and test them out for practicality to a particular task
<br>
is a computer that, for all intents and purposes, can innovate. And I'd
<br>
suggest that the day we can produce these cheaply enough that Singapore (or,
<br>
perhaps Tonga) can buy one is the day of the Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;It is questionable whether humans could ever properly wire together
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;100 million transistors -- but there are computers that can accomplish
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;that clever trick.  What one needs are the metrics and heuristics
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;that generate useful patterns and efficient means for recognizing
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;good combinations in specific knowledge domains.  We are slowly
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;(very slowly in most cases) managing to accomplish that.
</em><br>
<p>Well, what do you think? Will it always come in slow, small steps? Or might
<br>
it be possible to use the process self-reflexively so we can accelerate it?
<br>
I mean, we don't have all day.
