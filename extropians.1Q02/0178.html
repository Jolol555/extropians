<em>&gt;SEEING MORE THAN MEETS EYE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Science Finding Hallucinations May Be Reflection Of Brain Pathways
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;New research also indicates that prehistoric cave and rock art
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depicting spirals, zigzags and other geometric forms may have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;done by artists experiencing the same kind of drug-induced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hallucinations that people today have when they take LSD, mescaline,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ecstasy and other psychedelic compounds.
</em><br>
<p>Seeing &quot;spirals&quot;,&quot;geometric forms&quot;, etc. seem to be very deeply
<br>
wired in humans, in my opinion. I don't know if seeing these
<br>
requires a hallucinogenic state-of-mind, though. Children certainly
<br>
don't need a hallucinogenic mindset.
<br>
<p>In an art history class 20 years ago, my professor taught us that
<br>
children see particular geometric patterns at roughly similar ages,
<br>
all over the world, independent of culture. (Those of you with kids,
<br>
can you verify the following?)
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>Reference: Roda Keller: _Analyzing Children's Art_
<br>
(Note: I have sketches from my class notes for how these geometric
<br>
patterns look, but they don't translate well to this ascii medium)
<br>
<p>Between ~2 2/1 -- 4 1/2 years old.
<br>
<p>* First: Children scribble, a finite number of scribbles: 20
<br>
<p>* Next: (~2 1/2 -- 3 years), A child begins to combine the particular
<br>
types of scribbles.
<br>
<p>* Next: (~3-3 1/2 years) After scribbles, the child draws diagrams:
<br>
Six types of these: cross, rectangle, circle, upside-down-triangle,
<br>
x-mark, odd-shaped area
<br>
<p>* Next: Child draws &quot;Combines&quot; = (diagrams + scribbles)
<br>
<p>* Next: Child draws &quot;Aggragates&quot;: which is more than two diagrams
<br>
combined. Mandalas are Aggregates.
<br>
<p>* A Mandala (~3-4 years old), is a circle with a Greek cross in the
<br>
middle,. This is the most common, universal &quot;Combine&quot;. A child will
<br>
come to this state and stay on it for a long time (weeks/months).
<br>
<p>* Next: (~4 --&gt; ) years old
<br>
After the Mandala are the &quot;Radials&quot; and &quot;Suns&quot; symbols. They start
<br>
with the mandala and then become radial lines out of a circle.
<br>
<p>The radials are drawings of the human figure evolving, born inside
<br>
of a radial. Head appears, and the radial lines become arms and
<br>
legs, as if the &quot;sun is giving birth to the humans&quot;.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>The article &quot;Seeing More Than Meets The Eye&quot; goes on to say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Since spirals, tunnels, zigzags and other hallucinatory patterns can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be found in the art of almost all cultures and go back more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;30,000 years, many anthropologists speculate that they were done under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the influence of hallucinogenic drugs or self-induced trances, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that these experiences served as the origin of abstract art.
</em><br>
<p>and
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3 Stages Of Trances
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In their book, &quot;The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and Magic in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Painted Caves,&quot; Clottes and Lewis-Williams outline three stages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the first stage trance, people &quot;see&quot; geometric forms, such as dots,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;zigzags, grids, parallel lines, nested curves and meandering lines. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the second stage, subjects try to make better sense out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;geometric imagery by illusioning them into objects of religious or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotional significance, such as construing a zigzag line into a snake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The third stage is reached via a vortex or tunnel, at the end of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a bright light. When people emerge from the tunnel they find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves in a bizarre world where geometric patterns become mixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with monsters, people and settings. It is in this stage where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drawings of humans with animal features occur.
</em><br>
<p><p>It is possible to make some parallels with these &quot;three stages&quot; to the
<br>
stages that the children pass through in their development of &quot;abstract art&quot;,
<br>
that I described above. This is interesting.
