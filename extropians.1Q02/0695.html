Brian (w/my paraphrasing) suggested a distributed educational framework.

<p>Actually, having several hundred articles under &quot;tight leash&quot;
<br>
for just these reasons, I was surprised to find the spacefuture.com
<br>
site serving up sources rather openly.  They said that they had
<br>
investigated this to a fair extent and felt their risks were
<br>
minimal or taking down pieces of copyrighted information when
<br>
requested would suffice for damage control.  One has to balance
<br>
making the information available with the notice that:
<br>
<p>&quot;This document is NO longer available due to the threat of
<br>
a lawsuit from XYZZY because current copyright legislation fails
<br>
to prevent illegitimate copying while at the same time allowing
<br>
for copying for 'personal use'&quot;.
<br>
<p>Company XYZZY and the politicians responsible get a pretty black
<br>
eye for relatively zero cost on the part of the provider (while
<br>
conforming to the law).
<br>
<p>There is a recently published book that deals with the issue
<br>
of continually &quot;expanding&quot; copyrights when the original envisionment
<br>
of that right never viewed it as such.  (I think it was discussed on /.)
<br>
<p>There may be a significant &quot;divide&quot; between entertainment information
<br>
and academic information.  I know of examples where some academic
<br>
publishers have demonstrated really stupid protectionist perspectives.
<br>
At the same time I know that tens of thousands of scientists have
<br>
signed the petition that says they will not publish in journals
<br>
that remain unopen to public access and even a case where the entire
<br>
editorial board of a journal resigned to &quot;make the Journal free&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anyone can now be a &quot;content provider&quot; for the price of 3-5 movies/month
<br>
(well within the budget of middle class Westerners).   The bandwidth
<br>
requirements for &quot;education&quot; vs. &quot;entertainment&quot; are very low.
<br>
<p>So long as you have people willing to edit the content so
<br>
it is not &quot;essentially copied&quot; your risks of getting sued
<br>
are extremely low.  I see minimal barriers to uplifting the
<br>
uneducated other than language and access to minimal technology
<br>
levels (e.g. G3 wireless).  That may be expensive now but we know
<br>
that due to the decreasing technology cost curve that it should
<br>
not be so in the future.
