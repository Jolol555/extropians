<p>I've never read them, but I gather that sf writer Stephen Stirling's series
<br>
of novel about South African Nazi racist supermen, the Draka, does
<br>
something like this. And one of Jerry Pournelle's spin-off series
<br>
glorifying combat apparently has the gene-engineered Sauron supermen who
<br>
luckily get defeated by the brave free normals (yeah, right). If anyone's
<br>
read these books, it might be interesting to hear how they fit into this
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The Draka are best described as Afrikans/Revolutionary-Loyalist/
<br>
Prussian-Mercenary/Confederate-Losers descendants who 
<br>
through a series of remarkable and (admittedly unlikely events)
<br>
come to dominate an industrialized Africa run as an apartheid-slave
<br>
state.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Draka are not described as &quot;transhumanist&quot;... they are described
<br>
as &quot;posthumans&quot;.  Perhaps the most accurate descriptor would
<br>
be extreme eugenicists. Until they get gene-engineering. Then they
<br>
turn the next generation of themselves into a relatively uniform Human 
<br>
2.0 (Overlord Model).  Not an &quot;individualist&quot; posthuman... but
<br>
a &quot;posthuman caste&quot; model.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely stories. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of my take on what a largely organic posthuman entity would
<br>
be like is the most romantic least scary bits of Draka fiction.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sans pheremone-wired slave-primates who look like attractive
<br>
homo sapiens of course. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very efficent, very murderous monkeys. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I would point out is that the Draka (and their Adversaries,
<br>
the noble Yankees/Samthracians) are not dabbling in &quot;transapience&quot;.
<br>
The Draka are biologically immortal, but are wired to a biological
<br>
parasite role. The Samothracians (who are the cybernetic homo
<br>
normals) reject lifespan extension, and indeed, base their culture
<br>
around rejecting the &quot;temptation of the posthuman, we live and
<br>
die as humans&quot;.  Beyond a few kudos like universal &quot;high-human
<br>
normal&quot; IQ, photographic memory and some sensory modes..
<br>
the brains are basically human-class. Which is unforgiveable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
Brian
