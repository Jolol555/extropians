<p>
Certainly Godel himself, of whom Scoville quotes, provides a certain &quot;out&quot; 
<br>
for those seeking resolution,  especially if the universe is found to be 
<br>
rotational on even a marginal basis. Let us plot Scoville's universe onto a 
<br>
M-brane or D-brane theory map or manifold. The result could open up new means 
<br>
of communication and travel, but only for a very advanced physics that can 
<br>
make use of hyperdimensionality-something that Scoville doesn't seem to 
<br>
preclude. This purported scientific and technological advance shan't happen 
<br>
tomorrow or the next day, but quite a few eons down the road of time. 
<br>
<p>As for Dyson and Tipler's ideas being viewed as passe', lets just consider 
<br>
them for what they were. inspired essays into the fringes of physics, 
<br>
information, and life in the far future. Their thinking was based on physics 
<br>
as we new it, in the standard model SU¹. According to what I have read of 
<br>
many theorists, the minning of data from the past minkowskian light-cone is 
<br>
concievable. That is, at least, there is nothing inherent in relativity or 
<br>
quamtum theory or any new observations from Keck, or Hubble, or Boomerang, to 
<br>
prevent this hypothesis. 
<br>
<p>As for the &quot;tape&quot; that the Von Newmann cosmos may use, consider that we may 
<br>
not also be the tape, but at some point, part of what performs the 
<br>
record-punch. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Beyond the 'algorithmically random parameters of physical law' aspect
<br>
the paper has some ideas which touch upon topics discussed here.
<br>
Scoville's cosmic UTM has an absolute arrow of time, not a statistical
<br>
one, due to cosmic evolutionary events being irreversible for
<br>
consistency reasons.  I'd guess the outlooks for time travel and FTL
<br>
both look bleak; a limit on the propagation speed of information is
<br>
built into the system.
<br>
<p>And for that most extropian of topics, the long term future of life in
<br>
the universe, Scoville kills both Dyson and Tipler.  He doesn't mention
<br>
them, but his universe is discrete -- _has_ to be discrete, to be a
<br>
consistent computational system; a continuous universe wouldn't work.
<br>
And in a fixed discrete universe Dyson and Tipler's ideas won't work;
<br>
there's only so much you can do.
<br>
<p>Except that Scoville's cosmos isn't fixed.  Energy is conserved in
<br>
between symmetry breakings/random incorporation of new random
<br>
parameters, but not between them.  There's always new tape for the UTM.
<br>
Of course, we might not survive the transition...
