<em>&gt;From: &quot;Dickey, Michael F&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com?Subject=Re:%20Addiction">michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;But, the primary question is, CAN a person DECIDE to quit, or do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have no control over their actions?
</em><br>
<p>Later stage addicts do not appear to be able to quit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So a person who enjoys drinking a lot of alcohol, even though he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has no genetic predisposition to 'alcoholism' is not an alcoholic? 
</em><br>
<p>The defining point of an alcoholic is that they cannot/will not
<br>
quit.
<br>
<p>There are those hoping to reduce this to a definable medical test.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I would guess that Alcoholism, at the least, can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychologically addictive as well physically addictive.  I guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it depends on how you define alcoholism. Which leads to my next
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question, how do you define alcoholism.
</em><br>
<p>Most things that are physically addicting are psychologically
<br>
addicting as well.
<br>
<p>In fact I know of no such case where this is not true.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;D) someone who has this particular genetic variation
</em><br>
<p>This was the closest.
<br>
<p>Alcoholism is a matter of degree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Can non-alcoholics also drink significant quantities that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kill other non-alcoholics?  
</em><br>
<p>Most people cannot ingest sufficient quantities without getting
<br>
ill.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Or is that your definition of an alcoholic, someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*can* drink a lot of alcohol and not die?  (whatever that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arbitrary amount is)
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here we get back to what alcoholism is.  Is it 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;C)about behavior AND genetics?
</em><br>
<p><p>As I indicated earlier, once someone is diagnosed as alcoholic,
<br>
they have a moral obligation to quit. The fact that it is a disease
<br>
does not excuse this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;This is incorrect.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What is incorrect, that we can decide to stop eating, or that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can decide to stop doing things that we are addicted to?
</em><br>
<p>It is incorrect that all addicts can stop.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Can an alcoholic choose to stop drinking alcohol of his on free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will?  
</em><br>
<p>It is the refusal to stop that usually leads to a diagnosis of
<br>
alcoholism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Conversely, can some unfortunate person afflicted with MS 'choose'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to no longer be afflicted with MS?
</em><br>
<p>I had three independant experts tell me I had MS and would never
<br>
walk again. I told them to take a flying leap, and through self
<br>
rehab I have completely recovered.
<br>
<p>Miracle?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;that I agree to, the physiological mechanisms that contribute to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addictions and the sociological and behavioral conditions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contribute to addictions are indeed very complex.  But at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heart of the matter, people choose to do everything they do, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an alcoholic can choose to stop drinking (and many have, unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you define alcoholic as someone who can not choose to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drinking) just as a heroin addict can choose to not use heroin or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a cigarette smoker can choose to not smoke anymore.
</em><br>
<p>As I said the inability to stop is a defining element.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;IMHO that is...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;I'm dealing in facts, not opinions.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Sounded like a lot of opinions to me.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Alcoholism ...is a genetic predisposition to a substance&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;You cannot become an alcoholic without the requisite genetics&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;But in either case, I only added the 'IMHO' to encourage a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peacefull exchange of ideas, and did not expect it to be used as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a spring board for an argumentum ad hominem.  
</em><br>
<p>You'll have to point out the ad hominem, I don't see it.
<br>
<p>There are numerous sites that contain the facts I've indicated.
<br>
Alcoholism is defined as a disease by the AMA as well as AA.
<br>
<p>www.medicine.net.com/Script/Main/Art.asp?articlekey=8709
<br>
<p>is a good start.
