<em>&gt; So, before you envision a society where everyone finds it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurd to carry a gun, better envision one where everyone finds it absurd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to carry religious memes.
</em><br>
<p>This will surely be an important part of the project. Another part will be 
<br>
learning to think in networks of different cultures. I would also include 
<br>
quasi-religous memes like &quot;&lt;my nation&gt; is the best in the world&quot; and 
<br>
meta-religious memes like &quot;&lt;my opinion&gt; has more right to exist than yours&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now, what about the glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future of &lt;you-name-it&gt; technology, when you can't use it because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone could misuse it to kill you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you've discovered the necessity of developing extropian brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before developing other kinds of extropian technology.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, it seems I didn't make my point clear enough for you. If we 
<br>
would have to wait until everyone in this solar system has converted to 
<br>
extropianism before we can proceed, we could forget about the whole thing 
<br>
right now. The question is how we can all(!) live and prosper the next 
<br>
decades and centuries, until we have found more of the way. The &quot;others&quot; 
<br>
are part of the game, too. Not only as strangers we have to keep apart, but 
<br>
as fellow humans, we also need to learn from. We don't want to move into 
<br>
another no-alternatives situation, or do you?
