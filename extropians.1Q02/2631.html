<p>
I've gotten the message below a couple of times, so I guess the guy is
<br>
sending it pretty widely.  It's funny and sad at the same time, if he
<br>
is actually serious.  He obviously has some serious mental problems.
<br>
Still I supposed it is not that much more outlandish than the guy who
<br>
thought ET might be on the internet.
<br>
<p>Anyway it's nice of him to pay for our teleport to visit him, along with
<br>
the hotel stay.  Of course anyone who could do what he asked would have
<br>
no difficulty acquiring all the money he wanted.

<em>&gt; Subject: Time Travelers PLEASE HELP!! ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2002 19:45:47
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are a time traveler or alien disguised as human and or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the technology to travel physically through time I need your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My life has been severely tampered with and cursed!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have suffered tremendously and am now dying!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need to be able to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Travel back in time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rewind my life including my age back to 4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be able to remember what I know now so that I can prevent my life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from being tampered with again after I go back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am in very great danger and need this immediately!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am aware that there are many types of time travel, and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans do not do well through certain types.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need as close to temporal reversion as possible, as safely as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. To be able to rewind the hands of time in such a way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the universe of now will cease to exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that there are some very powerful people out there with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien or government equipment capable of doing just that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can help me I will pay for your teleport or trip down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, Along with hotel stay, food and all expenses. I will pay 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top dollar for the equipment. Proof must be provided.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please be advised that any temporal device 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you may employ must account for X, Y, and Z coordinates as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the temporal location.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a time machine now, but it has limited abilitys and is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a vortex. If you can provide information on how to create vortex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generator or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where I can get some of the blue glowing moon crystals this would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be helpful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am aware of two types of time travel one in physical form and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other in energy form where a snapshot of your brain is taken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using either the dimensional warp or an electronic device and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then sends your consciousness back through time to part with your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; younger self. Please explain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how safe and what your method involves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also if you are one of the very, very, few beings with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to edit the universe PLEASE REPLY!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only if you have this technology and can help me exactly as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please send me a (SEPARATE) email to: <a href="mailto:IneedTimeTravel@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Time%20Travel%20Spam">IneedTimeTravel@aol.com</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please do not reply if your an evil alien!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks
