</em><br>
<p>That is, of course, the dillemma. They do carry some advertising, and my
<br>
whole point is that they guarrantee that their free service actually
<br>
works, and they don't offer any demonstrations of their paid services so
<br>
you never know what you are getting. Pay for something, sight unseen?
<br>
Exqueeze me? The paid service is supposed to offer more features, but
<br>
they aren't specified. As Amara says, it seems like a bait and switch
<br>
scheme, only they are selling the same goods they claim to offer for
<br>
free.
