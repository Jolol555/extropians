<em>&gt; &gt; But at what cost, Harvey? Because medical care costs money, every dollar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spent is x.xx hours of someone's life spent laboring for themselves or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the government. Why slave away x hours of your life when you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only going to get a fraction of that back in increased life span?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I value my lifespan more than money.  I want to live longer and keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working if I can.  Why die early to save a little dough?
</em><br>
<p>I think you miss the point, Harvey: &quot;work&quot; is, by definition, time
<br>
spent in pursuits other than what would be one's first choice of
<br>
what to do with that time.  If you work for 12 hours to earn enough
<br>
to increase your lifespan by only 8 hours, then you haven't really
<br>
increased your &quot;life&quot; span at all--just your &quot;work&quot; span. You've
<br>
actually lost 4 hours of &quot;life&quot;--life is doing what /you/ want with
<br>
your time.
<br>
<p>There are, however, risk aversion to consider as well as EV: it
<br>
might be a negative-EV bet to spend some amount of money insuring
<br>
yourself against certain catastrophic but rare medical occurrences
<br>
that might otherwise cut one's life short by many years, but it
<br>
would probably be positive if your risk aversion is high enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also believe that even small increments of lifespan let you live longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the future where better life-extending techniques will be available.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few measly years might let me reach some new longevity breakthrough.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather have a chance at immortality rather than saving a few bucks.
</em><br>
<p>That is another possible counter-argument: if extending the end-point
<br>
of one's existence (even at the expense of &quot;life&quot; time as defined above)
<br>
sufficiently increases the likelihood of technology becoming available
<br>
that makes up for the work spent getting there, then you've won the bet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, you can use those calculations to limit healthcare spending by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government for other people, if you want.  But personally, I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend lots of money on keeping me alive.  If I ever have a choice between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying and spending money, I'll spend the money.  I can't imagine ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping my money because life-extension is not cost-effective.  What good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will the extra money do me if I die early?
</em><br>
<p>Again, the choice is not between dying and spending money: the choice is
<br>
between spending, say, 3 years working to get 1 &quot;extra&quot; year of free time,
<br>
or just spending 1 year working and 2 years in free time directly.  Another
<br>
possible factor in that equation is one's enjoyment of work: if one's work
<br>
is very close to what one would otherwise choose to do anyway, then the
<br>
time lost can be discounted by some rate, possibly making it a good deal.
