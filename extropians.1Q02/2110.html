<p>
The national parliament has just voted a law that forbids both
<br>
reproductive (20 years emprisonment) and therapeutic human cloning.
<br>
There was no public debate whatsoever (there was some media talk, but
<br>
there was no debate, with contradictory opinions, etc., because there
<br>
is no public interest). The law project still needs (so to speak) to
<br>
be approved by the &quot;conseil constitutionnel&quot; in late February. That
<br>
was Jacques, reporting from France. (Thanks, Jacques.)
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I guess that if research on animal, and research on
<br>
humans led in other countries, keep making progress, the opportunities
<br>
to French humans will become more concrete to said French humans, and
<br>
then they can think twice about it.
<br>
<p>They just ban it so that they don't have to think about it, then wait
<br>
for other people to make experiences, so that they can take a more
<br>
informed decision in the future. If that was everyone's way, we'd be
<br>
frozen.
<br>
<p>I reflected the other day that maybe the French society can work the
<br>
way it works ONLY because the American society is more libertarian :
<br>
thus more innovation occurs in the States, which is then adopted in
<br>
France without the R&amp;D costs nor the social costs, which allows for
<br>
prosperity and redistribution without the need to pay the cost.
