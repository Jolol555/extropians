<p><p>...Has anybody defined what they mean by the word 'magic/k' yet? How many

misunderstandings are based on semantics? On the other hand, the conclusions

we jump to do reveal a lot about ourselves...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<p><p>...We explain, and explore, ever-increasingly, both of these things. In the
<br>
same way that some dork said, 'Strangers are just friends I haven't met
<br>
yet', I see 'magic' as 'science we haven't sussed yet'.  Am I missing
<br>
something here?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if I happen to suggest that the alignment of the planets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results in fluctuations in the quantum gravity field that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictates how chromosomes recombine which results in the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; magic physics, at least some people might think I was making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a serious claim.  But people are going to want to see the data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>...That depends on whether you're presenting an idea for brainstorming or a
<br>
scientific theory...or a plot for an episode of star trek...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I was recently asked my opinion about this site:
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.stardrivedevice.com/">http://www.stardrivedevice.com/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All I could say was that at first glance they seemed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposing technologies that would violate a number of accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws of physics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And 'magic'. Sci-fi turns into reality? How many times?...If we 'play' hard
<br>
enough on the surface, the real work goes on underneath. That's all I think
<br>
people mean when they speak of 'magic'. In another couple of years it will
<br>
have some respectable name, such as 'Biofeedback Psychology', and will be
<br>
another useful neurohacking software tool.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So -- that may be the &quot;razor&quot; when it comes to &quot;Magick&quot; -- if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can propose a magick that appears magical but does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violate laws of physics then it is reasonable to bring it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the table.  If you propose magick that appears to violate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws of physics then the burden of proof is on your shoulders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to explain where the laws of physics need to be extended or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how such ideas do not violate the laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>...Which is why I am doing the research I am doing...I bear the burden of
<br>
proof...ouch.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I would sooner believe that one could change the neural connections
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your mind to *really* believe that magick had happened than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could change the physical laws of the universe.  It comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down to a simple question of which is more malleable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>...But doing that would be 'magic'...oh dear.

'I am alone.

I am afraid.
