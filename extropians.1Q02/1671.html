<p>
Is there any evidence to suggest a link between autism and birth / early
<br>
parenting methods? I read some while ago that this was the case but have
<br>
been unable to find any reference to it.
<br>
Of course I realise that such things as birth methods and parenting methods
<br>
are not necessarily genetic, but most parents do tend to copy their own
<br>
parents to some extent in childrearing, so the effect would run in families.
<br>
I do believe that 'autism' is something rather special and that the
<br>
'benefits' of such a condition may come to outweigh the disadvantages.

<p><p><em>&gt; Argument For Autism as a Genetic 'Epidemic'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &quot;Have the airplane and the computer changed the architecture of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind? And is that why autism is on the increase?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Simon Baron-Cohen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      People with autism can be affected to varying degrees, but their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principal mental characteristics are that they have difficulty in fitting
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; with other people or figuring out people's feelings and perspectives (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disability) whilst they have a natural flair for analysing the non-social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world in fine detail, and in understanding non-social systems (a talent).
</em><br>
So
<br>
<em>&gt; whilst they may appear socially odd to their peer-group within their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, their long hours focused on understanding a system like
</em><br>
mathematics
<br>
<em>&gt; or calendars, car engines or music, navigation or computer-programming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grammar and vocabulary, can lead them to high levels of expertise within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrow domains of knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      People with autism are usually male, and these men would
</em><br>
traditionally
<br>
<em>&gt; have not competed well in the competition for mates, as appearing socially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odd might have either put off prospective females from choosing them, or
</em><br>
put
<br>
<em>&gt; off prospective parents-in-law from arranging such a marriage for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; daughters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      And then two massive changes hit the planet: the airplane and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      The airplane has allowed unprecedented opportunities for changing
</em><br>
your
<br>
<em>&gt; culture. And when you go from your native culture into another one, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social oddness may be far less obvious. &quot;Oh, he behaves like that because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's English&quot;, a Brazilian might say, or vice-versa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Social oddity can be minimised to some extent by moving cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we are all experts in knowing the subtle body language and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intonation of our own cultures but might just mistakenly assume that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreigner's different body language or intonation is due to their
</em><br>
different
<br>
<em>&gt; culture. We might overlook what to people in their culture would appear
</em><br>
odd
<br>
<em>&gt; and off-putting. So someone with autism might find it far easier to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted, even by the opposite sex, when they are abroad, compared to when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are in their native country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      The computer has penetrated every work-place. In just 50 short years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is now no office in the developed world where computers are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential, and we need those people with the cool, razor-sharp logic to
</em><br>
fix
<br>
<em>&gt; them, reconfigure them, develop them, adapt them, program them. The
</em><br>
autistic
<br>
<em>&gt; mind was sitting around for centuries, even millennia, under-employed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because how many jobs were there for mathematicians and scientists, who
</em><br>
also
<br>
<em>&gt; needed this style of thinking? Drops in the ocean. And then the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opened up for computer-scientists - the most in-demand of workers in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern age. Tidal waves in the ocean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Computer-scientists, irrespective of their social skills, could now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hop on a plane and find a job, get rich, and have something to offer a
</em><br>
girl:
<br>
<em>&gt; social status, a salary, a niche in which they fit, and even be accepted
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; normal for a foreigner - for who of us can judge what is normal for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreigner? Or even if they just stayed in their own culture, they were now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more valued and accepted than before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      This is not to say that all computer-scientists lack social skill.
</em><br>
Far
<br>
<em>&gt; from it. We all know computer-scientists who are good socializers. Nor is
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; to say that those severely affected by autism could suddenly shift and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become a successful programmer. But those who had a dash of autism could.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     No longer the socially isolated, unemployed, &quot;weird&quot; guy who could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list every prime number up to 10,000 in minutes, but who couldn't have
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt; a semblance of a conversation with a girl at a party. Now the successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer scientist, well-paid, whose talent at &quot;systemising&quot; has enabled
</em><br>
him
<br>
<em>&gt; to learn a foreign language and be accepted, and even find a date and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Autism is genetic: it runs in families. But whereas in 1970 the rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of autism was 4 in 10,000 people, today it is 1 in 200 people. The rate
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; gone up more than twelve-fold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Twelve-fold? Is this an epidemic? Some have rashly thought this might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be because of some pollutant or even vaccine damage, but the evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is thin. Certainly, the increase in autism is in part because of
</em><br>
better
<br>
<em>&gt; detection and awareness, thanks to the tireless work of autism charities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      But could it also be that this has also been a result of the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid evolutionary change to the human brain that we have witnessed? A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent issue of Wired Magazine in December 2001 reported that the rate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autism was hitting record rates in Silicon Valley, where a new
</em><br>
evolutionary
<br>
<em>&gt; niche was opening up for people to fly in from around the planet, sell
</em><br>
their
<br>
<em>&gt; mathematical and systemising talent, and find reproductive success which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would otherwise have remained beyond reach. Our experimental research is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent with this interpretation, and warrants further testing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      If this evolutionary change is real, should we fear it? On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary, we should welcome and celebrate it. Good socializers have always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found it easy to survive and reproduce, but we need our good systemisers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too, for the benefit of the planet. These are the guys (men and women) who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to push science and technology forward, and create our future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank Darwin that life is now a bit easier for them too.
