<p>Agreed that perfecting the right mix of foodstuffs in the right packaging

would be inefficient, besides it is a nitpick.  Appended is a report on
<br>
dropping rice to the Lao proxy forces:
<br>
<p>TO: Mr. William R. Leonard, ASB     16 October 1972
<br>
<p>FROM: MacAlan Thompson, ORA/Logistics
<br>
<p>SUBJ: Rice Dropping [Secret War in Laos]
<br>
<p>The USAID/Laos, Office of Refugee Affairs, has been in the rice dropping 
<br>
business for about 10 years.  At present we are delivering approximately 
<br>
2500 MT (5.5 million pounds) of foodstuffs per month by freefall 
<br>
drops;  this includes rice, canned meat, salt, and PL-480 
<br>
commodities.  Some of the various problems, solutions, and alternatives we 
<br>
have met are as follows:
<br>
<p>THEORY:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  That 40 kg of rice packed inside three each 100 kg capacity 
<br>
jute sacks will survive a free-fall drop with minimal loss and breakage.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  That this 40 kg triple-sacked unit MUST impact perpendicular 
<br>
to the ground, i.e., drop vertical for a horizontal DZ or at an angle of 
<br>
about 45 deg for a DZ sloped at 45 deg.
<br>
<p>PRACTICE:
<br>
<p>The process is composed of three basic steps, i.e., 1)  rebagging of rice, 
<br>
2) rigging/palletizing for drop, and 3)  dropping.  Each step, with some 
<br>
alternatives, will be discussed in turn.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Rebagging:  Rice is normally delivered to the warehouse in 100 
<br>
kg net weight jute bags.  As our requirement is for 40 kg rice, we have a 
<br>
&quot;services&quot; contract for rebagging the 100 kg single-bag rice into 40 kg 
<br>
triple-bag drop units.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two basic prices in this contract, 1) about $24/MT if 
<br>
the contractor furnishes the bagging materials (sacks and string), and 
<br>
2)  about $1.50 if the contractor furnishes labor only and the government 
<br>
furnishes the bagging materials.  We normally use the $24/MT rate and the 
<br>
contractor has the responsibility, and the attendant problems of buying, 
<br>
shipping, warehousing, and maintaining the materials pipeline for about 1.3 
<br>
million jute bags each year.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use empty reclaimed jute sacks, 29&quot; x 43&quot;, of 100 kg 
<br>
capacity and jute twine for sewing.  The cost of the reclaimed jute sack 
<br>
varies from $0.20 - $0.35 each and is presently toward the high end of the 
<br>
range because of the international jute shortage caused by the January '72 
<br>
Bangladesh war.  The twine runs $0.50 - $0.60 per kg;  jute bags are 
<br>
usually readily available in SEA as most of the local agricultural products 
<br>
are transported in jute.  Certainly if a rice rebagging/drop program is to 
<br>
be set up on short notice, jute bags will probably be the only material on 
<br>
hand.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting January '73, we plan to rebag utilizing two 
<br>
polypropylene bags and one jute bag rather than three jute bags.  Still 
<br>
triple sacked but the cost of Singapore poly bags is only about $0.24 each 
<br>
thereby lowering the cost of the triple-sacked unit from $0.90 to about 
<br>
$0.75, or an annual savings of about $100,000 on the AID/Laos drop volume 
<br>
of 20,000 MT.  If this alternative was implemented utilizing U.S. origin 
<br>
poly bags the annual cost would increase by about $150,000.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few figures for reference:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 MT rice in 100 kg sacks = 10 sacks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 MT rice for drop (40 kg sacks) = 25 units
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 MT of 40 kg triple-sacked drop units = 75 jute sacks (25 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;units x 3 sacks /unit)
<br>
<p>Therefore, when bagging 1 MT of 40 kg triple-sacked rice you need a total 
<br>
of 75 jute sacks of 100 kg capacity, 10 of which contain the 1 MT of rice 
<br>
delivered and 65 of which must be bought empty.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, into the act of bagging.  This sample is based on a 100 MT 
<br>
per day volume as used in Vientiane, Laos.  Requirements are 100 MT of rice 
<br>
delivered/packed in 1000 jute bags, approximately 50 kg of jute twine for 
<br>
sewing, and 6,500 reclaimed empty 100 kg capacity jute bags, and about 
<br>
50-75 laborers.  The 100 kg rice is dumped onto the warehouse floor and is 
<br>
then shoveled into the empty bags in approximately 40 kg lots.  This 40 kg 
<br>
bag, as yet unsewn and single bagged, is placed on a balance type platform 
<br>
scale and a small quantity of rice is either added from the pile or removed 
<br>
from the bag to bring the weight to 40 kg.  This single bag is then hand 
<br>
sewn.  The single sewn bag is then upended into a second bag, which is then 
<br>
sewn, being careful not to tie into the inner bag, and this double bagged 
<br>
unit is again upended into the third and last bag for final sewing.  This 
<br>
completes the 40 kg net weight triple-bagged drop sack;  three jute sacks 
<br>
sewn separately with the middle bag &quot;inverted&quot; so that its hand-sewn seam 
<br>
is opposite the hand-sewn seams of the first and third bags.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain this volume of 100 MT per day we run two 
<br>
production lines utilizing only hand labor.  Each like is composed of 1) 
<br>
laborers unloading and emptying the incoming 100 kg rice onto the 
<br>
pile;  2)  three laborers shoveling and weighing the 40 kg rice into the 
<br>
first bag;  3)  the firs of three sewing crews (as each bag is sewn it is 
<br>
passed onto the next crew who add a bag and sew);  4)  the stacking/loading 
<br>
crew.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AID/Laos also bags rice, using the same basic system and 
<br>
materials, at two out-stations, Luang Prabang (L-54) and Ban Houei Sai 
<br>
(L-25).  The volume at these stations rarely reaches 10 MT per day and can 
<br>
be performed by as few as 10 laborers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attachment &quot;1&quot; is a sample copy of a jute bag contract and 
<br>
Attachment &quot;2&quot; is a copy of the alternative polypropylene bag contract as 
<br>
available from HYTEX (PTE) LTD, Singapore.  Attachment &quot;3&quot; is our current 
<br>
rebagging contract (K 605 per $1.00).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commodities other than rice can also be airdropped by using 
<br>
this rebagging system.  For example, AID/Laos is dropping such rebagged 
<br>
items as PL-480 cornmeal, bulgur wheat, and noodles.  We also drop what we 
<br>
call &quot;hash,&quot; which is composed of 32 kg rice and 12 each 1-lb cans of 
<br>
meat.  Cans suitable for dropping are available in Bangkok and can surely 
<br>
be manufactured elsewhere.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Rigging:  The second basic phase of rice dropping is 
<br>
palletizing and rigging the 40 kg triple-bagged rice for air drop.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although rice may beloaded loose (i.e., not palletized) on 
<br>
the floor of an aircraft and then stacked 7-9 bags high in the door for 
<br>
drop, this system is not normally used by AID/Laos, mainly because of 
<br>
safety.  There is little emergency jettison capability loading in this manner.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system used here with the C-46, C-7A, and C-123 utilizes a 
<br>
flat wood pallet with two guide rollers and double tracks in the 
<br>
aircraft.  The pallet is either plywood or laminated masonite and can be 
<br>
either disposable or not depending on the track system used in the aircraft.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our earlier model of disposable pallet would probably be most 
<br>
suitable for use in a C-47, depending on the availability of either plywood 
<br>
or masonite.  It is a 15 mm thick (about 1/5 inch) and measures 29&quot; x 
<br>
34&quot;.  The corners are cut to prevent snagging and holes are drilled to 
<br>
provide tiedowns for the drop rice.  (See Attachments 4, 5, 6, and 
<br>
7).  This pallet holds 9 sacks of 40 kg rice.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six bags of rice are first placed on the pallet, and about an 
<br>
18 ft length of rope is laid across the top.  Three additional bags are 
<br>
added and are bundled together with a single turn of the rope.  The long 
<br>
ends of the rope are then secured to the two side holes of the pallet and 
<br>
tightened.  The purpose of tying these three top bags separately and 
<br>
securing them to the pallet is to prevent the pallet from striking the left 
<br>
horizontal stabilizer on the C-46 when the load hits the propblast.  To 
<br>
secure the palletized load during ground handling and while in the aircraft 
<br>
before drop, two lengths of rope are tied diagonally across the rice to the 
<br>
four corner holes in the pallet.  One only of these ropes is cut before 
<br>
dropping.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a C-46, this 29&quot; x 34&quot; pallet with guide rollers is used 
<br>
with two sets of double-tracks joined forward of the door by a Y-section 
<br>
which runs into a curved track to the door.  The last straight track 
<br>
section extends about 8&quot; outside the aircraft.  Seven pallets are loaded on 
<br>
one track and six on the other.  Because of cabin width restrictions, a 
<br>
C-47 would probably be restricted to a single double-track and a curved 
<br>
section and would be restricted by ACL to 4.5 to 5 pallets.  One loaded 
<br>
pallet weighs about 950 lbs.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reusable pallet is basically identical except for 
<br>
size.  It uses 3/4&quot; plywood, 32&quot; x 48&quot;, and holds 18 bags of 40 kg drop 
<br>
rice in two stacks of 9 bags.  The main difference is inthe tracks on the 
<br>
C-46.  The last straight section of double-track that extends outside the 
<br>
aircraft for use with the disposable pallets is modified to a tilt 
<br>
section.  At the moment of drop, when the loaded pallet is pushed past the 
<br>
balance point of the tilt section, the pallet guide rollers engage flanges 
<br>
that are inserted in the tilt-track guide slot.  The loaded pallet tips 
<br>
outside the aircraft, the rice drops off, the empty pallet tilts back 
<br>
inside, is slid out of the holding flanges, and the tilt track section is 
<br>
ready for another pallet for the next pass.  A sample of this tilt section 
<br>
can be made available to interested parties.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securing the drop rice to the recoverable pallet is simplified 
<br>
as there is no pallet leaving the plane to strike the stabilizer.  One turn 
<br>
of 3/8&quot; manila rope is tied around all 18 bags to prevent &quot;floating&quot; bags 
<br>
in the first 1-2 seconds after drop.  Two ropes are tied diagonally across 
<br>
the load to the four corner holes of the pallet.  These ropes secure the 
<br>
load during handling and MUST be cut before drop.  An alternative, which 
<br>
cuts down on rope usage, is to use a small rope loop at either end of the 
<br>
pallet and type XIII webbing with two hooks made from 1/4&quot; rebar and a 
<br>
quick fit adapter (AN 6517, MS 2204, 48A7058).
<br>
<p>NOTE:  The rollers used with this reusable pallet are threaded for a nut 
<br>
rather than welded as is the case with the disposable pallet.  After 
<br>
200-300 drops, when the track side of the pallet gets marked and grooved by 
<br>
the tracks, the pallet is turned over, the rollers changed and the pallet 
<br>
is good for another 300 drops.  See Attachments 8 and 9 for drawings of 
<br>
this pallet and roller.
<br>
<p>Another Note:  None of the plywood used is of U.S. origin.  U.S. plywood 
<br>
was dried and found to be too soft.  Bangkok origin, and most commercial 
<br>
plywood in SEA, is made from comparatively hard wood and is not grooved 
<br>
heavily by the tracks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Dropping:  The most important consideration in rice dropping 
<br>
is the principle (Law) that the triple-sacked rice bag MUS impact the 
<br>
ground at an angle of 90 deg.  Any forward motion remaining from the 
<br>
aircraft drop speed when the bag impacts will cause the bag to slide across 
<br>
the ground and rip.  This loss is quite evident when observing actual drops 
<br>
as the rice is spread out in a fan from the ripped bag in the direction of 
<br>
drop.  In a &quot;normal&quot; broken bag from a 90 deg impact, the rice will be 
<br>
spilled radially 360 deg.  This only solution to &quot;fan&quot; breakage is to 
<br>
decrease aircraft drop speed or increase drop altitude.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the C-46, C-7A, and C-123 the drop speed is 100-11- knots 
<br>
at 900-1,000 ft drop altitude on a horizontal DZ.  The drop altitude is 
<br>
correspondingly lower for sloped DZs as, even tho the drop bag will still 
<br>
have some forward speed remaining upon impact, the bag will impact 
<br>
perpendicular to the ground slope.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest drop system does not use tracks or pallets.  The 
<br>
drop rice is loaded loose in the aircraft and brought to the door(s) in 7-9 
<br>
bag lots.  The first bag is laid in the door perpendicular to the axis of 
<br>
the aircraft and extends about 12&quot; outside the aircraft.  The next 6-8 bags 
<br>
are stacked on top of the first bag but parallel to the axis.  At the 
<br>
buzzer, the 2-4 kickers tilt the bags out using the available &quot;ears&quot; of the 
<br>
first drop bag.  The main disadvantage of this system is the lace of a 
<br>
quick jettison capability in case of an emergency.  A modification to this 
<br>
system is to use tracks and pallets except at the door for dropping.  If 
<br>
plywood or laminated masonite pallets are at a premium, this mod offers a 
<br>
degree of safety while saving materials.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the disposable 29&quot; x 34&quot; pallet with a C-46, two 
<br>
pallets are dropped per pass.  The first pallet is pushed flush with the 
<br>
door and the second pallet is butted against the first.  Three or four 
<br>
kickers are used,the first pair pushing the pallet in the door and the 
<br>
second pair of kickers handles the second pallet.  At the drop buzzer, all 
<br>
kickers push and the pilot assists by tilting the aircraft to the 
<br>
left.  Only ONE of the tie ropes is to be cut.  The other tie rope helps 
<br>
prevent &quot;floaters.&quot;  The drop rice works loose from the second rope before 
<br>
impact (usually).  As a C-46 normally carries 13  pallets, this system 
<br>
takes 7 passes to complete the load.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free fall rice drop system currently in use by AID/Laos 
<br>
utilizes the recoverable plywood pallet and a C-46 with the &quot;tilt-track&quot; 
<br>
mod at the door.  Three kickers handle one pallet at a time (18 bags/pallet 
<br>
at 90 lbs/bag).  The pallet to be dropped is positioned just short of the 
<br>
balance point of the tilt-track section and, at the buzzer, is pushed 
<br>
forward.  Seven passes are required per planeload.
