<p>Well, you can network X-Plane. At this point, people mostly dial each
<br>
other up to fly together, but there are projects people are doing to
<br>
establish X-Plane game servers on the web.
<br>
<p>While it runs on Win and Mac, there currently is no *nix version of
<br>
X-Plane, but I suppose you could run it on WINE. Since this is a small
<br>
company (essentially one programmer, Austin Meyer), he does have his
<br>
hands full. While the graphics accelleration uses OpenGL, X-Plane is not
<br>
necessarily an open source project. Austin seems to treat it as
<br>
'semi-open', providing code to those who are especially nice to him, but
<br>
not suffering fools gladly.
<br>
<p>The system requirements listed on the website are not really mandatory.
<br>
I'm running version 6 just fine on a Pentium Pro 200 mhz with 32 megs of
<br>
ram and a nvidia 128 board with 32 megs of video ram and the rendering
<br>
is very very good.
<br>
<p>Some of the other features:
<br>
- Intelligent air traffic control speech synthesis
<br>
- Realtime weather downloaded for the geography you are flying in
<br>
- Database of actual airfields all over North America (and Europe for
<br>
european customers) even little pisspot strips. 
<br>
- Accurate topographical rendering, buildings of note, etc.
<br>
- Aircraft carrier operations
<br>
<p>The classic version of X-Plane uses no graphics accelerators, but I
<br>
don't think much of it. XPlane 6 sells at K-Mart for I think $39.95.
