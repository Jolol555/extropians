<p>
I am developing an alternate theory to Max's &quot;Dynamic Optimism&quot; called
<br>
&quot;Dynamic Pessimism&quot;.  Sometimes I think it makes more sense than Max's
<br>
philosophy.  I am not sure it will be as popular, however.
<br>
<p>I claim that we actually will fail to get green lights most of the time when
<br>
we are in a hurry to go fast, and that we will fail to get red lights most
<br>
of the time if we want to stop and rummage through the glove box.  This is
<br>
because we talk about traffic lights as having two states:  green and red.
<br>
In reality, there is a third state (and I'm not talking about yellow).
<br>
<p>State One:  You zoom through a green light without having to slow down or
<br>
stop.  This counts as success when you want to go, but failure when you want
<br>
to stop.
<br>
<p>State Two:  You stop at a red light.  This counts as success when you want
<br>
to stop, but failure when you want to go.
<br>
<p>State Three:  &quot;The worst of both worlds.&quot;  The light has turned green, but
<br>
there are still cars stopped from when it was red.  You can't zoom through
<br>
because of the cars.  Therefore this counts as failure if you want to go.
<br>
However, you only slow down or stop for a moment.  There is not enough time
<br>
to rummage through the glove box.  This therefore also counts as failure
<br>
when you want to stop.  This is neither a go nor a stop, but some hellish
<br>
state inbetween that annoys everybody.
<br>
<p>If we zoom through state one 40% of the time, stop at state two 40% of the
<br>
time, and get disrupted at state three 20% of the time, the odds are that we
<br>
will get a failure mode 60% of the time no matter which mode we want to be
<br>
in.
