I also stopped using Hushmail after seeing that version 2.0 was not
<br>
working well.
<br>
I believe the business model of Hushmail is offering the free service
<br>
to capture users for the for a fee service. When 2.0 was launched they
<br>
actually decreased the size of mailboxes, and advertised the 32M
<br>
mailboxes more.
