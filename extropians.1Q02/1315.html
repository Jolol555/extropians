<em>&gt; &gt; Let me say this one more time: all people have an equal right to marry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone of the opposite sex. There is NO discrimination in this at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gays and lesbians, transgendered and bisexuals all have the same right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to marry someone of the opposite sex that heteros do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are again using the dictionary definition of a word to argue law.  Equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights or lack of discrimination does not mean they are treated the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Equal rights or lack of discrimination means everyone is equally left alone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pursue their own life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
</em><br>
<p>I am being ethically and linguistically consistent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Making everyone vote Democratic would treat everyone the same.  By the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictionary definition, this would not be discrimination.  But legally, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would violate the rights of Republicans and give unequal protection to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrats.  Likewise, the establishment of a state religion would treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone the same.  Everyone would be free to participate in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion.  The founding fathers clearly saw that this &quot;equal treatment&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be unfair to minority religions.  They demanded and instituted freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of religion for all religions, not just the majority religion.
</em><br>
<p>And here I thought we were all Americans. You can make everyone vote
<br>
Democrat, and just as quickly all republican politicians will become
<br>
democrats, and republican voters can continue to vote for the formerly
<br>
republican candidates based on their PRINCIPLES and not based on their
<br>
party affiliation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The concept of being treated &quot;the same&quot; has little bearing on legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions of discrimination.  Most discriminatory laws that have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overturned applied to everyone the same way.  This did not stop them from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having a devastating impact on one segment of the population while giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferred treatment to another.  You are correct when you argue the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictionary definition of these words, but you are incorrect when you argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the legal concepts that use these same words for specific legal concepts.
</em><br>
<p>Discrimination is about treating one person differently from another,
<br>
end of story. If the legal concepts are bastardized, it is only because
<br>
of hypocritical, manipulative demagogic politicians who continue to use
<br>
propaganda to twist words around on themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I entirely support the idea of redefining marriage, but lets not play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; games with claiming a pre-existing right where none exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, most courts have found that this is a pre-existing right assumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the constitution of the United States and of most individual states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This occurs every time a state supreme court rules that gays have the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to marry.  There is then a quick move to /amend/ the state constitution to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prohibit this right.  Legally, in such cases, the right was interpreted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have always existed and was recently removed by congressional action in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those states.  Although you may disagree in various ways with this history,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is the legally correct and legally binding history of many of these laws.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and the supreme court of New Hampshire has claimed that the state
<br>
constitution states that every individual has a right to an 'adequate'
<br>
education, when there is no such language saying such whatsoever.
<br>
Activist courts can invent anything they want, that doesn't rewrite
<br>
things, it only shows what lying demogogues they are. 
<br>
<p>When a right is not defined in a constitution, it remains with how the
<br>
people of each state choose to define it by state law. That IS what the
<br>
10th Amendment is all about: undefined rights are reserved to the people
<br>
UNLESS they choose to restrict them under state law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going to redefine marriage, you still are going to wind up defining it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such that it discriminates against the desires of some segment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Keep in mind that the social mores that cause people to be disgusted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the desires of groups like NAMBLA are very similar to the ones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; create homophobia and other anti-gay sentiments, and which restricted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same sex marriages throughout history. Lets not claim that there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant difference here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a big difference between consenting adults and unconsenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children, or between co-equal partners and unequal adult and child roles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, children are not legally able to give consent unless laws specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give them the right, whereas adults are legally able to give consent unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws specifically take away that right.  These two cases are polar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposites, legally speaking.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. After all, the legal definition of what is and is not a
<br>
consenting adult is as much a legal fiction as a definition of what is
<br>
and is not legal cohabitation, sexual action, or decent or indecent
<br>
exposure. If you are going to redefine what legal cohabitation is, you
<br>
might as well be consistent and redefine all of these laws that relate
<br>
to private relationships between individuals. If you are going to be a
<br>
hypocrit about it at least be honest about being a hypocrit. Admitting
<br>
it doesn't bother me at all.
<br>
<p>For thousands of years of human history, it has been the age of 13 which
<br>
has been the age of consent. This has crept upward over time and in
<br>
different places (and at different ages for different genders, which is
<br>
another 'equal protection' can of worms), such that it is really
<br>
impossible today to make any real claims about what a proper age for
<br>
'consent' is. You can get as many shrinks and neurologists to give you
<br>
as many differing opinions about it as there are different jurisdictions
<br>
with different ages of consent.
<br>
<p>The historical record demonstrates that there is far more historical
<br>
tolerance for adolescents posessing consent than for gays and lesbians
<br>
to have relations legally. The modern glbt community in the US tries
<br>
very hard to separate themselves from pedophilia only because of modern
<br>
mores that refuse to accept such behavior, and are willing to believe in
<br>
a fictitious achievement called 'adulthood' which mysteriously appear at
<br>
a specific age for everybody. In that, they are as hypocritical as any
<br>
WASP. The least they can do is be honest about it.
