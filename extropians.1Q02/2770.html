<p>&lt;&lt; BTW: One large reason among several for me deciding not to return to
<br>
&nbsp;live in the U.S. is the U.S government's current &quot;War on *&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;stupidities.  There's a bit more sane attitude about that nonsense in
<br>
&nbsp;Europe. But maybe not for long. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My take on this goes something like this. World War 3 was won by the
<br>
republics against the Soviet Union, circa 1991. This is currently World War
<br>
4, and its being fought against terrorism. Terrorism from whom? Terrorism
<br>
from Islamic Fundamentalist Muslims. This war will take a long time, and
<br>
victory by the USA is by no means assured. Like the Cold War before it, this
<br>
war is ideological. What is at stake? For whatever reason, as is now being
<br>
demonstrated with that London educated sheik, who is on the run from the
<br>
authorities (allegedly). This fellow, along with millions of fellow Muslims
<br>
yearn for the destruction of America and the founding of Sharia, and a new
<br>
Muslim ascendency. &gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This comment brings something to mind that I read and found amusing.
<br>
(loosely paraphrased) (back in a science fiction tome found in a school
<br>
library lo these many years ago)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;World War 1 was a war where the chemists showed their mettle.
<br>
(Chemical weapons etc.).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;World War 2 was of course the war of the physicists. Nuke nuke nuke.
<br>
&nbsp;The suggestion was made that World War 3 would be the war of
<br>
the biologists...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and World War 4 would be the War of the psychologists.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if this is out of order ? :)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll take WW1 as a chemist's war, and WW2 as a physicist's war,
<br>
but WW3 (the Cold War) I rather thought THAT was a psychologist's
<br>
war. A war of propaganda, maneuver, bluff etc. This War on terrorism
<br>
is perhaps the &quot;fighting of the last war&quot; with the weapons (mass media,
<br>
mob psychology etc.) we developed in the Last Big One.
<br>
It's working marvelously.
<br>
&nbsp;Everyone
<br>
assumed we would be using the weapons of the Last Big One to
<br>
prosecute the Cold War, but we didn't, not exactly. More of
<br>
a War via marketing to muster the economic clout to outlast
<br>
socialism (at least in it's extreme form).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume that the chem-phys-psych-bio progression is essentially
<br>
sound. What sort of war would WW4 be?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the likely enemies?....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's 1920.. where is the Evil Axis?
<br>
