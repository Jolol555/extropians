<p>Ah, so we base the discussion on conceptual processing and imagination,

eh?  And do we ignore the lack of same in the bulk of the species?  Ayn 
<br>
Rand's own irrationality was amply analyzed by Nathaniel Branden in an 
<br>
article he wrote.  I do not reduce the argument to those &quot;inanities&quot; - your 
<br>
attempt to simplify my argument to that level is incorrect.  I still have 
<br>
yet to hear anyone translate the human capacity for conceptual processing 
<br>
or any other human need into a need for a &quot;natural law&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Codified physical law&quot; is hand-waving.  There is the physical universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which includes biology and evolution.  There are human concepts of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;scientists who are not so sure that there ARE &quot;physical laws&quot; operative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;throughout the Universe).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you claiming that human beings hae no specific nature and that their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature does not lead to certain conditions being more optimal for their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well being, particularly concerning their interaction with other people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and instutions of same?  You have to claim this if you are going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;utterly dismiss the argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Physical laws are not the end and be all of what is real and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important.  They are the basis of reality but do not utterly contain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything in reality, if you see what I mean.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously I am not claiming anything of the sort - do not put words in my 
<br>
mouth.  Of course humans have specific needs - what I am objecting to is 
<br>
the unnecessary transformation of a need into a mystical concept of &quot;right&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Give the above notion of natural rights the natural rights exist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;regardless of whether they are honored by any particular ruler or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;mob.  Judging the actions of the rulers or mobs is done relative to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;supporting or denying these &quot;natural rights&quot;, these requirements for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;human well-being.  This seems much more reasonable than attempting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;reverse, judging the concept of natural rights on the basis of whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;this or that leader or group would honor and uphold them.   Saying they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;are a social contract, in my opinion, makes a similar mistake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;It puts the emphasis on upholding these rights rather than on whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;certain &quot;rights&quot; naturally are required by dint of the nature of human beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This still begs the question:  why is the concept &quot;rights&quot; needed?  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have basic human physical needs.  Why elevate them to &quot;rights&quot; unless you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are trying to score points in a moral debate?  A principle of Objectivist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;epistemology, I recall, is that concepts should not be multiplied beyond need.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I already answered that question.  And the second one by implication. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a principle of Objectivism that rights are objective, derivable from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality.  If so there is no multiplication of concepts beyond need.  What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exactly would you base ethics on if not on some understanding of what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required for human beings to function optiomally together?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You have not answered the question except with more hand-waving.  It may be 
<br>
a principle of Objectivism, but they did not derive it logically either 
<br>
except with hand-waving.
<br>
<p>I am amused that some people few the notion of ethics as a given essential 
<br>
of the universe.  If something does not fit their &quot;ethics&quot;  they cannot 
<br>
comprehend why it exists.  To be precise, there is in fact no need for 
<br>
ethics at all.  What is needed is a set of principles by which one can act 
<br>
in a social context and which provide the most likelihood of satisfying 
<br>
one's survival needs.  If you wish to call these principles &quot;ethics&quot;, feel 
<br>
free.  I call them principles, so as not to expand concepts beyond need and 
<br>
in the bargain burden a concept with mystical baggage.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;What your nature requires relative to the actions of others or their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;refraining from certain actions for your optimal functioning does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;change based on how they do in fact act toward you.  Natural rights 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;therefore are not a matter of social contract.  Social contracts, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;they are rational, grow out of these &quot;natural rights&quot; - not the reverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Human behavior as individuals and groups is based on human &quot;nature&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;i.e., the structure of our bodies and brains and our physical and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cultural evolution - and to an enormous degree on our primate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;evolutionary heritage.  This behavior considered as a whole can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;modeled by various sciences and by economic theory a la Von Mises 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;praexology [or is that praxeology - I can never remember the spelling :-} 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;]  Such an economic analysis leads to the conclusion that coercion on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;large scale or as a general principle of behavior is not productive for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;group of sentient conceptually processing entities as a whole.  No
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This is a way of arriving at much the same thing.  You seem to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quibbling more over semantics.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  One concept is based on mysticism (&quot;rights&quot;), one on 
<br>
demonstrable economic analysis of the behavior of large groups of 
<br>
people.  One concept is based on &quot;natural law&quot; - a meaningless concept - 
<br>
and one is based on practical results - productivity or non-productivity 
<br>
toward a specific purpose - survival of the individual and the species.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;natural rights&quot; are needed - it is simply not productive and therefore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not conducive to survival and therefore not in the best interests of such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;entities to engage in coercion as a behavioral principle.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Your first assertions does not justify your derived conclusions as you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have not grounded it in anything but opinion thus far.
</em><br>
<p><p>That is itself opinion.  I did not go into the detailed derivation of the 
<br>
principle of non-coercion via economic behavior because it would be too 
<br>
extensive - and in any event I have not done so in so long I might remember 
<br>
all the details.  The short version is simply that coercion is an attempt 
<br>
to achieve monopoly profit.  To the degree that it succeeds, others will be 
<br>
motivated to invest in coercion in the same manner as investors invest in 
<br>
any activity that shows a substantial profit.  The result of this 
<br>
investment is the business life cycle - eventually the profit is reduced to 
<br>
the average rate of return.  The result of investing in coercion would be a 
<br>
society (much like the present one, I guess) where the bulk of activity 
<br>
goes into non-productive security and defense or coercion (which does not 
<br>
produce but merely distributes wealth).  One therefore can see that as a 
<br>
general social principle, coercion is non-productive and therefore 
<br>
contra-survival.  No mystical &quot;rights&quot; are needed to derive this conclusion 
<br>
- merely common sense as to the behavior of others and the results of that 
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;The reality, however, is that humans as part of their basic nature as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;biological entities fear death.  This translates into the same basic two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;reactions as any other animal:  fight or flight.  In humans, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do humans have that other animals do not have?  It is there that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must explore.
</em><br>
<p><p>Obviously.  My point is also obvious - the bulk of the population do not 
<br>
explore this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;imagination and conceptual processing capability, this is expressed in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;two ways for each reaction.  Fight:  1)  self-development or controlling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;one's personal being (examples might be bodybuilders, martial artists, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;whatever). 2) Concern with understanding and controlling external reality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;(examples might be scientists, technologists, etc.)  Flight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is required to freely act on the basis of one's thinking and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conclusions?  Without that freedom, can humans make most effective use of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their superior abilities to think and model reality?
</em><br>
<p>One has THAT freedom at all times.  The question is:  does one have the 
<br>
physical freedom to act.  One always can think and model reality;  the 
<br>
question is can one act on one's conclusions?  Obviously I understand that 
<br>
- the point is irrelevant to the question of rights because, again, no one 
<br>
has established that rights either exist as a valid concept or have any 
<br>
effect on preventing coercion in the real world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Response: 1) Stand up and wave your arms and try to attract the attention 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of the &quot;gods&quot; who might give you more life if you stand out from the herd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;(examples:  anyone in the public eye and anyone who tries to establish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;themselves as morally superior to everyone else, e.g., priests and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;philosophers and moralists of every stripe); 2) Tear down
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is simple libel.  Not all people of these groups do anything of the kind.
</em><br>
<p><p>Oh, really?  If you look at the motivation of virtually anyone in the 
<br>
public eye (at least those who have striven to be there, not been 
<br>
accidently thrust there), and especially at the motivation of those who 
<br>
proclaim that THEIR way is the only way and anyone who disagrees is morally 
<br>
inferior. it is clear that the intent is to elevate themselves above others 
<br>
first and foremost before any other goal.  And the motivation for THAT is 
<br>
the fear of death.  Read Harrington's &quot;The Immortalist&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;everyone above you and stamp on everyone below you (examples:  virtually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;everyone, especially politicians).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My, you are cynical, aren't you?
</em><br>
<p><p>I am correct.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Instead of recognizing the universe has plenty of resources and the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to survive is to use our conceptually processing capability to take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;advantage of those resources, i.e., fight response, - defy and defeat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;death by using our mental and physical resources - the vast bulk of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;human race (at least 98-99%) engage in flight response, producing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Darwinian competition &quot;war of all against all&quot; which leads to the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you see around you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You almost had it but you keep getting mired in too simple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stimulus/response levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your characterization of my analysis as &quot;simple stimulus/response&quot; is an 
<br>
example of how you view yourself as vastly superior to the ordinary primate 
<br>
from which you evolved.  You aren't THAT superior.  You DO have those 
<br>
reactions built into your brain.  I recognize that in myself.  The 
<br>
difference is that I recognize it in others as well.  I imagine once they 
<br>
get through sequencing the pygmy chimp genome that people are going to be 
<br>
in for a big surprise at just how little difference there is between humans 
<br>
and chimps.  We already know that the difference is around 1.5% of the 
<br>
genetic code.  I suspect we will discover that not much sequencing change 
<br>
is needed to get rid of the extra hair, provide an opposable thumb, change 
<br>
the facial features, and enlarge the brain pan...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;See Alan Harrington's work &quot;The Immortalist&quot; - probably the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;important book ever written on the impact of death on human society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Without relieving the species' fear of death, there is no way you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;going to override that fear and its flight response with talk of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;rights&quot;, when those &quot;rights&quot; are merely concepts that will be accepted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or rejected based on the individual's fear reactions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Irrelevant. It is only by exercising our ability to think and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to  understand our universe and act on that understanding to a high degree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we can ever hope to long postpone or even largely defeat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death.  Therefore that which increases our abilities in these areas, our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedoms to pursue them and our freedom to act on our conclusions, is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most essential solution to the general problem as you set it up.
</em><br>
<p><p>Which translates into what?  Trying to change the world by argument?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Those things required for such an increase are thus logical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirements of any system governing the interaction of human beings (ethics).
</em><br>
<p><p>There IS no system governing the interaction of human beings.  There is 
<br>
only the world as you see it now.  Nor will there be such a system without 
<br>
major changes in human nature - which will come with the Singularity - at 
<br>
which point the need for such a system will become moot as Transhumans are 
<br>
not humans and will not need the sort of governance you suggest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  One concept/phrase wrapping such requirements and delineating them is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;natural rights&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Wrong - &quot;natural rights&quot; is a concept which states that such requirements 
<br>
are &quot;natural law&quot; - again, no one has ever demonstrated the notion of 
<br>
&quot;natural law&quot; or &quot;natural rights&quot; - nor will they because the concept of 
<br>
rights is a mystical concept.  See Wilson's &quot;The Myth of Natural Rights&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   We may argue about what is and is not such a requirement but I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see how anyone can logically fault the general basis in our own nature 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their being such requirements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The only rational argument for non-coercion is based on economic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;self-interest which in turn is based on the economic interest of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;species as a whole.  This argument, however, cannot override genetically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;inbred fear, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;More assertion?
</em><br>
<p><p>You have evidence of the contrary that refutes 10,000 years of 
<br>
civilization's history?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;The issue of &quot;rights&quot; is IRRELEVANT to the issue of personal survival 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which is the only valid human purpose.  Personal survival demands dealing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.  One can certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;proceed on the basic of a principle of non-coercion, but trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;convince any significant portion of the species of the validity of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is a waste of time and therefore counterproductive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;More assertion.  Personal survival is not the only valid human purpose.
</em><br>
<p><p>Oh,. yes it is.  There are no values without life - continuity of 
<br>
existence.  That means that survival is the only primary purpose of any 
<br>
living entity.  All other values are secondary and dependent on the 
<br>
survival of the entity.  THAT much Ayn Rand got right.  Do not mistake my 
<br>
use of the term survival for some low-level notion that implies struggling 
<br>
through life and then dying.  I use the term in the sense William Burroughs 
<br>
did when he said, &quot;Survival must be calculated in immortal terms.  Beware a 
<br>
fool's survival.&quot;  I refer to survival as indefinite continuity of 
<br>
existence.  Whether the physical universe will permit true &quot;immortality&quot; 
<br>
(i.e., existing &quot;forever&quot; - whatever that may mean) is irrelevant; the goal 
<br>
remains the same.  Once you realize what that means, and think about it, 
<br>
you will discover that there are corollaries to that conclusion which lead 
<br>
to radical changes in philosophy and attitude.  THAT is what it means to be 
<br>
a Transhuman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The world as it is includes what is required by human nature for our own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best functioning and the best function of our  organizations, society and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species as a whole.  It is not counterproductive to point out where our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best interests lie in anything more than the extreme short-term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Mike's notion that because human nature derives from evolution and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;physical universe that this translates a concept into a &quot;natural law&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;an irrational and mystical concept.  See Robert Anton Wilson''s &quot;The Myth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of Natural Rights&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That is not what he or I said and such an empty attempt at parody is not a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;valid attempt at discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Best reread what Mike said.  No parody needed.
