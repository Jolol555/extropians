<p>How Islam Lost Its Way
<br>
Yesterday's Achievements Were Golden; Today, Reason Has Been Eclipsed
<br>

<br>
<p>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- If the world is to be spared what future historians
<br>
may call the &quot;century of terror,&quot; we will have to chart a perilous course
<br>
between the Scylla of American imperial arrogance and the Charybdis of
<br>
Islamic religious fanaticism. Through these waters, we must steer by a
<br>
distant star toward a careful, reasoned, democratic, humanistic and secular
<br>
future. Otherwise, shipwreck is certain.
<br>
<p>For nearly four months now, leaders of the Muslim community in the United
<br>
States, and even President Bush, have routinely asserted that Islam is a
<br>
religion of peace that was hijacked by fanatics on Sept. 11.
<br>
<p>These two assertions are simply untrue.
<br>
<p>First, Islam -- like Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism or any other
<br>
religion -- is not about peace. Nor is it about war. Every religion is about
<br>
absolute belief in its own superiority and the divine right to impose its
<br>
version of truth upon others. In medieval times, both the Crusades and the
<br>
Jihads were soaked in blood. Today, there are Christian fundamentalists who
<br>
attack abortion clinics in the United States and kill doctors; Muslim
<br>
fundamentalists who wage their sectarian wars against each other; Jewish
<br>
settlers who, holding the Old Testament in one hand and Uzis in the other,
<br>
burn olive orchards and drive Palestinians off their ancestral land; and
<br>
Hindus in India who demolish ancient mosques and burn down churches.
<br>
<p>The second assertion is even further off the mark. Even if Islam had, in
<br>
some metaphorical sense, been hijacked, that event did not occur three
<br>
months ago. It was well over seven centuries ago that Islam suffered a
<br>
serious trauma, the effects of which refuse to go away.
<br>
<p>Where do Muslims stand today? Note that I do not ask about Islam; Islam is
<br>
an abstraction. Maulana Abdus Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's preeminent social
<br>
worker, and the Taliban's Mohammad Omar are both followers of Islam, but the
<br>
former is overdue for a Nobel Peace Prize while the latter is an ignorant,
<br>
psychotic fiend. Palestinian writer Edward Said, among others, has
<br>
insistently pointed out that Islam holds very different meaning for
<br>
different people. Within my own family, hugely different kinds of Islam are
<br>
practiced. The religion is as heterogeneous as those who believe and follow
<br>
it. There is no &quot;true Islam.&quot;
<br>
<p>[Odd - surely one of the more interesting facts about Islam is that it has
<br>
retained a remarkable degree of homogeneity irrespective of cultural
<br>
variation, and has largely avoided the fragmentation undergone by
<br>
Christianity, whose history is essentially one of schism -RR]
<br>
<p>Today, Muslims number 1 billion. Of the 48 countries with a full or near
<br>
Muslim majority, none has yet evolved a stable democratic political system.
<br>
In fact, all Muslim countries are dominated by self-serving corrupt elites
<br>
who cynically advance their personal interests and steal resources from
<br>
their people. None of these countries has a viable educational system or a
<br>
university of international stature.
<br>
<p>Reason, too, has been waylaid.
<br>
<p>You will seldom see a Muslim name as you flip through scientific journals,
<br>
and if you do, the chances are that this person lives in the West. There are
<br>
a few exceptions: Pakistani Abdus Salam, together with Americans Steven
<br>
Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1979. I got
<br>
to know Salam reasonably well; we even wrote a book preface together. He was
<br>
a remarkable man, terribly in love with his country and his religion. And
<br>
yet he died deeply unhappy, scorned by Pakistan, declared a non-Muslim by an
<br>
act of the Pakistani parliament in 1974. Today the Ahmadi sect, to which
<br>
Salam belonged, is considered heretical and harshly persecuted. (My
<br>
next-door neighbor, an Ahmadi physicist, was shot in the neck and heart and
<br>
died in my car as I drove him to the hospital seven years ago. His only
<br>
fault was to have been born into the wrong sect.)
<br>
<p>Though genuine scientific achievement is rare in the contemporary Muslim
<br>
world, pseudo-science is in generous supply. A former chairman of my
<br>
department has calculated the speed of heaven: He maintains it is receding
<br>
from Earth at one centimeter per second less than the speed of light. His
<br>
ingenious method relies upon a verse inthe Islamic holy book, which says
<br>
that worship on the night on whichthe book was revealed is worth a thousand
<br>
nights of ordinary worship. He states that this amounts to a time-dilation
<br>
factor of 1,000, which he puts into a formulaof Einstein's theory of special
<br>
relativity.
<br>
<p>A more public example: One of two Pakistani nuclear engineers recently
<br>
arrested on suspicion of passing nuclear secrets to the Taliban had earlier
<br>
proposed to solve Pakistan's energy problems by harnessing the power of
<br>
genies. He relied on the Islamic belief that God created man from clay, and
<br>
angels and genies from fire; so this highly placed engineer proposed to
<br>
capture the genies and extract their energy.
<br>
<p>Today's sorry situation contrasts starkly with the Islam of yesterday.
<br>
Between the 9th and 13th centuries -- the Golden Age of Islam -- the only
<br>
people doing decent work in science, philosophy or medicine were Muslims.
<br>
Muslims not only preserved ancient learning, they also made substantial
<br>
innovations. The loss of this tradition has proven tragic for Muslim
<br>
peoples.
<br>
<p>Science flourished in the Golden Age of Islam because of a strong
<br>
rationalist and liberal tradition, carried on by a group of Muslim thinkers
<br>
known as the Mutazilites.
<br>
<p>But in the 12th century, Muslim orthodoxy reawakened, spearheaded by the
<br>
Arab cleric Imam Al-Ghazali. Al-Ghazali championed revelation over reason,
<br>
predestination over free will. He damned mathematics as being against Islam,
<br>
an intoxicant of the mind that weakened faith.
<br>
<p>Caught in the viselike grip of orthodoxy, Islam choked. No longer would
<br>
Muslim, Christian and Jewish scholars gather and work together in the royal
<br>
courts. It was the end of tolerance, intellect and science in the Muslim
<br>
world. The last great Muslim thinker, Abd-al Rahman Ibn Khaldun, belonged to
<br>
the 14th century.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of the world moved on. The Renaissance brought an
<br>
explosion of scientific inquiry in the West. This owed much totranslations
<br>
of Greek works carried out by Arabs and other Muslim contributions, but they
<br>
were to matter little. Mercantile capitalism and technological progress
<br>
drove Western countries -- in ways that were often brutal and at times
<br>
genocidal -- to rapidly colonize the Muslim world from Indonesia to Morocco.
<br>
It soon became clear, at least to some of the Muslim elites, that they were
<br>
paying a heavy price for not possessing the analytical tools of modern
<br>
science and the social and political values of modern culture -- the real
<br>
source of power of their colonizers.
<br>
<p>Despite widespread resistance from the orthodox, the logic of modernity
<br>
found 19th-century Muslim adherents. Some seized on the modern idea of the
<br>
nation-state. It is crucial to note that not a single Muslim nationalist
<br>
leader of the 20th century was a fundamentalist.
<br>
<p>However, Muslim and Arab nationalism, part of a larger anti-colonial
<br>
nationalist current across the Third World, included the desire to control
<br>
and use national resources for domestic benefit. The conflict with Western
<br>
greed was inevitable. The imperial interests of Britain, and later the
<br>
United States, feared independent nationalism. Anyone willing to collaborate
<br>
was preferred, even the ultraconservative Islamic regime of Saudi Arabia. In
<br>
1953, Mohammed Mosaddeq of Iran was overthrown in a CIA coup, replaced by
<br>
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Britain targeted Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser.
<br>
Indonesia's Sukarno was replaced by Suharto after a bloody coup that left
<br>
hundreds of thousands dead.
<br>
<p>Pressed from outside, corrupt and incompetent from within, secular Muslim
<br>
governments proved unable to defend national interests or deliver social
<br>
justice. They began to frustrate democracy to preserve their positions of
<br>
power and privilege. These failures left a vacuum that Islamic religious
<br>
movements grew to fill -- in Iran, Pakistan and Sudan, to name a few.
<br>
<p>The lack of scruple and the pursuit of power by the United States combined
<br>
fatally with this tide in the Muslim world in 1979, when the Soviet Union
<br>
invaded Afghanistan. With Pakistan's Mohammed Zia ul-Haq as America's
<br>
foremost ally, the CIA openly recruited Islamic holy warriors from Egypt,
<br>
Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Algeria. Radical Islam went into overdrive as its
<br>
superpower ally and mentor funneled support to the mujaheddin; Ronald Reagan
<br>
feted them on the White House lawn.
<br>
<p>The rest is by now familiar: After the Soviet Union collapsed, the United
<br>
States walked away from an Afghanistan in shambles. The Taliban emerged;
<br>
Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda made Afghanistan their base.
<br>
<p>What should thoughtful people infer from this whole narrative?
<br>
<p>For Muslims, it is time to stop wallowing in self-pity: Muslims are not
<br>
helpless victims of conspiracies hatched by an all-powerful, malicious West.
<br>
The fact is that the decline of Islamic greatness took place long before the
<br>
age of mercantile imperialism. The causes were essentially internal.
<br>
Therefore Muslims must be introspective and ask what went wrong.
<br>
<p>Muslims must recognize that their societies are far larger, more diverse and
<br>
complex than the small homogeneous tribal society in Arabia 1,400 years ago.
<br>
It is therefore time to renounce the idea that Islam can survive and prosper
<br>
only in an Islamic state run according to sharia, or Islamic law. Muslims
<br>
need a secular and democratic state that respects religious freedom and
<br>
human dignity and is founded on the principle that power belongs to the
<br>
people. This means confronting and rejecting the claim by orthodox Islamic
<br>
scholars that, in an Islamic state, sovereignty belongs to the vice-regents
<br>
of Allah, or Islamic jurists, not to the people.
<br>
<p>Muslims must not look to the likes of bin Laden; such people have no real
<br>
answer and can offer no real positive alternative. To glorify their
<br>
terrorism is a hideous mistake: The unremitting slaughter of Shiites,
<br>
Christians and Ahmadis in their places of worship in Pakistan, and of other
<br>
minorities in other Muslim countries, is proof that all terrorism is not
<br>
about the revolt of the dispossessed.
<br>
<p>The United States, too, must confront bitter truths. The messages of George
<br>
W. Bush and Tony Blair fall flat while those of bin Laden, whether he lives
<br>
or dies, resonate strongly across the Muslim world. Bin Laden's religious
<br>
extremism turns off many Muslims, but they find his political message easy
<br>
to relate to: The United States must stop helping Israel in dispossessing
<br>
the Palestinians, stop propping up corrupt and despotic regimes across the
<br>
world just because they serve U.S. interests.
<br>
<p>Americans will also have to accept that their triumphalism and disdain for
<br>
international law are creating enemies everywhere, not just among Muslims.
<br>
Therefore they must become less arrogant and more like other peoples of this
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>Our collective survival lies in recognizing that religion is not the
<br>
solution; neither is nationalism. We have but one choice: the path of
<br>
secular humanism, based upon the principles of logic and reason. This alone
<br>
offers the hope of providing everybody on this globe with the right to life,
<br>
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
