<em>&gt; &gt;Way too much holography and gloss. The 50 is printed in pink metallic.

<em>&gt; Someone should be videotaping people's expressions at the ATMs. Their

</em><br>
<p>You know, I get the same thing here whenever I pay for something with
<br>
Sacagawea dollar coins. The cashier/waitress/bartender, etc almost
<br>
always gape and grin at these odd, gold colored coins, saying &quot;What's
<br>
this?&quot;, despite the fact that the coins have been in public for a coupla
<br>
years already. 
<br>
<p>I wouldn't mind the reintroduction of larger denominations in coins,
<br>
since inflation certainly makes them more useful now. I recall the
<br>
wondrous days of childhood when grandpa would do his little slieght of
<br>
hand, pulling a silver dollar out of my ear to give to me, when a dollar
<br>
was worth something (three and a half gallons of gasoline, in fact).
<br>
Today, while my nephew certainly enjoys finding 'free money' of pennies
<br>
and nickels on the laundryroom floor, he does object to being paid &quot;just
<br>
a buck&quot; for chores doing actual work. A trip to watch airplanes at the
<br>
airport is more valuable, though.
<br>
<p>As for the idea of introducing new money for it's own sake: not a good
<br>
idea intrinsically (just look at those unfortunates in Argentina who now
<br>
have to get by on worthless 'Argentinos' since there aren't enough pesos
<br>
to go around.) Money is nothing but a symbol of trust. Regularly
<br>
replacing one type of money with another would corrode that trust and
<br>
thus lead to hyperinflation. The US dollar is the de facto world
<br>
currency partly because it has changed so little over time. Visual
<br>
stability implies security and therefore trust.
<br>
<p>I don't expect the Euro to seriously challenge the US Dollar for
<br>
dominance as the world currency, partly because it is so new, partly
<br>
because there are different flavors for each member country, and mostly
<br>
because it is dependent upon 12 central bank systems instead of one.
<br>
Furthermore, while many countries around the world peg their own
<br>
currencies to the dollar for stability, few will be encouraged to do the
<br>
same with the Euro, because Europe still has far more baggage re
<br>
imperialism and colonialism than the US ever had, and the Free Trade
<br>
Area of the Americas will always be larger than the EU can ever be.
