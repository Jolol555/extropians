Jacques Du Pasquier:
<br>
<em>&gt; That's how teaching now &quot;works&quot; : you test children again and again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until they figure out a way to pass the test ; you actually never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teach them THAT, and some never learn. The only thing that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught is left to complete improvisation, and that accounts for huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences between individuals, because some find great tricks and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-tricks with which the readily build feats of cognition, and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are stuck with unefficient tricks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A teacher should model his pupil's mind and actually help it to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself further. He should suggest useful tricks for the pupil to try,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopt and combine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why does this remind me of extreme programming? 
<br>
