<p><em>&gt;Damien, I have not found this to be the case in my part of the world.  A

book having been written by an Australian is seen as a major marketing
<br>
point to be emphasized.
<br>
<p>I was sloppy. Obviously, once a book has been bought in NY and distributed
<br>
to stores in the States, most readers won't care where the writer lives or
<br>
comes from. Is there anything about koalas in Greg Egan? Well, some
<br>
references to Sydney or other antipodean settings, but that's just minimal
<br>
color in his fiction. 
<br>
<p>That assumes the books get into the stores to start with.
<br>
<p>There's often a kind of numbing provincialism (sorry) in the reception
<br>
response of Americans to the *tonality*, the *not-American-ness* of
<br>
anything Not From Here (where Here is probably the constructed Here you see
<br>
in TV). Or so it's assumed, tacitly, by many publishers.
<br>
<p>Now this aversion might be overstated--but we'll never know, because
<br>
publishers and agents tend to act as if it's so. There are notable
<br>
exceptions; the NYT recently ran a reading group on the almost
<br>
pathologically Australian novel by Peter Carey about the bushranger Ned
<br>
Kelly... but that book had already won the prestigious British Booker Prize. 
<br>
<p>It's not just a matter of implied accent. All manner of tiny default
<br>
details are different in Australian novels, even if they're set on Mars.
<br>
The more Australian my books are (the way characters talk, the places they
<br>
live, the bits of local history they reference), the harder they are to get
<br>
read by agents let alone read by publishers let alone bought. It doesn't
<br>
matter how much praise they've had here. They are *insufficiently American*
<br>
in small details that poor brilliant John Brunner, a British sf writer,
<br>
tried for decades to emulate, unsuccessfully (and was regularly,
<br>
hilariously mocked by sarcastic ORBIT series editor Damon Knight for his
<br>
blunders).
<br>
<p>This has less bearing on science *non*-fiction, but even there we have a
<br>
kind of glitch, and not just because most of the big bucks science,
<br>
naturally, is done in the USA. Much leading work in medicine, molecular
<br>
biology and its applications have been done in Oz, but I don't think the
<br>
few books about this work published here have met with interest in the
<br>
States. Paul Davies is our only big success story, and he's a comparatively
<br>
recent Brit import.
<br>
<p>I hope everyone sees that this post isn't a nasty diatribe against the USA
<br>
or Americans. I jest lerrrrv Americans, mostly; my partner is an American.
<br>
What I'm talking about is just one of the costs of imperial power. I thank
<br>
the flip of the dice every day that at least I didn't grow up speaking
<br>
Italian or Greek, in which case my writing career would have been far more
<br>
segregated than it is now.
<br>
<p>Is there any extropian or &gt;H relevance in these comments? Well, it might
<br>
not do any harm for any advocacy group centered in America to notice these
<br>
funny little glitches now and then. It's a big world out here, and many
<br>
Americans, with all their immense power, are seeing it through a quite
<br>
narrow slot. And the narrowness of the window isn't just what's imposed by
<br>
authority and corporate ownership; the net, at least, is breaking that down
<br>
(but of course it's also reinforcing it). I'm talking about an internal
<br>
narrowing of response, almost beyond notice when you allow it to happen to
<br>
yourself in the company of millions of other who are doing the same dance.
<br>
<p>FWIW.
