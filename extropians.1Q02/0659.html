<em>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20&quot;Sound%20and%20Fury&quot;%20over%20enhancements">hal@finney.org</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;For Mike and his fellow conservative ideologues, consider an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence enhancement for your children which has an observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;side effect: almost all of them become Socialists.  Quel horreur! 
</em><br>
<p><p>Then clearly the intelligence enhancement was a failure, give Greg
<br>
Burch or one of his associates a call.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It's not implausible: in fact in many of the most difficult and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;esoteric branches of science and mathematics, branches which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;require the highest levels of sheer abstract intelligence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thrive, Socialism and allied political philosophies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;widespread.  I remember reading an obituary in The Mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Intelligencer which went to some length to apologize for the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the deceased was not a Socialist.  He was still a decent guy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the obit hastened to explain, he just had this one little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political blind spot.
</em><br>
<p><p>There are a great many things that sound great in theory and fall
<br>
flat on their faces in the real world. Socialism being one of my
<br>
favorite examples.
<br>
<p>By failing to take into account human nature Socialism proves it is
<br>
too abstract. Failing to realize this proves your mathematician
<br>
friends need to spend more time in the real world.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So you can make your kid a genius, but it will take him from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political philosophy you have embraced all your life.  He will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have nothing but contempt for your political views.  He will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lost to your political culture.  Yet you will be giving him great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;powers for advancement and achievement in life.
</em><br>
<p><p>If he wants to be a socialist fine, just tell him to go to his
<br>
socialist friends for money....
<br>
<p>Like I said if he goes in for intelligence enhancement and comes
<br>
out socialist, sue the doctor.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In this situation, is it so easy to see that enhancing your child
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is automatically the right thing to do?  How do you like MIKE'S
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PROPOSAL that society FORCE you to enhance the child?
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with forcing anyone to do anything except not harm
<br>
others, or themselves if they are unstable.
<br>
<p>If people chose to remain handicapped when other options are
<br>
available, more power to them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Hopefully as Extropians we have the courage and the faith to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our children these advantages even at cost to ourselves and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;link to them. But clearly for most people this will be an even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more difficult decision. If transhuman technologies are most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easily applied to children, which is plausible due to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greater neural plasticity (which is why the cochlear implants only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work on them), then we may all find ourselves in the position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the deaf for whom Mike shows such scorn.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see what faith has to do with it, but I think Kahlil Gibran
<br>
put children into perspective long ago:
<br>
<p>&quot;Your children are not your children. They are the sons and
<br>
daughters of life's longing for itself.&quot;
