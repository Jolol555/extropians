<p>after Damien Broderick wrote a brief sketch of Australian ideals

<p><em>&gt;From: Damien Broderick &lt;<a href="mailto:d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20Bye-Bye%20to%20the%20&gt;H%20Right%20Wing">d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The background political assumptions of Australians appear to differ in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subtle and less subtle ways from those of Americans, and even more from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those of many Europeans. I found a quote today that helps position our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; historic standpoint; it's from Alfred Deakin, an early Prime Minister of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the nation, who in 1906 (just five years after Federation) said this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; `The best thing that Australians could do was to make the country so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; productive, so good a place to live, and bring about such just and fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditions, with such  fair opportunities for earning an honest living,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such protection against monopolies, that other people would also want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become Australians.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Excellent. So a victim-disarming monopoly on the use of deadly force is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prohibited, of course. Also, the monetary system shall not be imposed by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;monopoly fiat: forcing nearly everyone to become bonded debt-slaves to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Statists/bankstas. These items, along with income-tax slavery, monopoly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public &quot;education&quot; (i.e. Statist indoctrination camps) and monopoly Social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Security pyramid schemes are some of the most demeaning, unjust, evils 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(meaning &quot;to cause harm&quot;) perpetuated by the protection racket 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occasionally referred to as the State. I've never been down under, but I'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;move there in a heartbeat if the above organized-crime schemes were absent.
</em><br>
<p>So goes the litany of evils that so many Americans seem to project upon the 
<br>
kind of mild, almost disinterested, social responsibility that seems to 
<br>
color Oz.
<br>
<p>You know what is the strangest thing? The people who foam most strongly at 
<br>
the mouth when screeching about the evils of society are those who have 
<br>
benefitted most from it. Those who have been born into the richer classes, 
<br>
who have gained their wealth and knowledge from countless generations 
<br>
before them, demand that they alone be recognised as being the creators of 
<br>
their good fortune and that they are damned if they will share it with 
<br>
anybody else.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Thanks for the offer, sport, but I already live on or about the socialist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shithole of Plantation USA, picking my &quot;fair share&quot; of cotton for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greater grandeur of Massah'. I use Karl Marx's definition of socialism: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto, abolition of private property 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(slaves don't own property), dissolution of the family, etc., which is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fairly accurate, funtionalistic description of the contemporary US System.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure you don't really know how lucky you are Mr Bishop. You have become 
<br>
insulated from the real world. Surely you don't really think that USA is 
<br>
anything approaching communist. This must surely be chest-beating, soapbox 
<br>
hyperbole... your favorite rant... not anything to do with the real world.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.

To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
