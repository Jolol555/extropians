</em><br>
<p>Again, I agree that one should pay for one's own costs, even if it
<br>
might also be moral of other compassionate people to help one out.  The
<br>
problem with the above reasoning is that you assume that getting the
<br>
implant is purely beneficial. In practice getting an implant means a
<br>
lot of hard training, a slight but real risk of infections or other
<br>
damage and the worry that the child might be stranded between cultures.
<br>
<p>It is well worth remembering that many disabled people are extremely
<br>
sceptical of new gizmos and treatments doctors are trying to push -
<br>
they are the ones who will have to live with them even if they do not
<br>
work, while the doctor often stands to gain valuable (to him at least)
<br>
research data and risks nearly nothing. In the past several treatments
<br>
promoted extensively have proven nearly disastrous, and at least here
<br>
in Sweden the deaf culture is still angry after a failed pedagogical
<br>
program that made an entire generation of deaf people signing impaired
<br>
and hearing impaired. 
<br>
<p>It is against this background one has to realize that introducing
<br>
cochlear implants is a very sensitive business. It is far easier to
<br>
sell the idea of retinal implants.
