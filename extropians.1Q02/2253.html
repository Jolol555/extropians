</em><br>
<em>&gt; [I said:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am not now nor have I ever been a member of the Communist Party. (Are
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It works for me. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The background political assumptions of Australians appear to differ in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle and less subtle ways from those of Americans, and even more from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those of many Europeans. I found a quote today that helps position our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historic standpoint; it's from Alfred Deakin, an early Prime Minister of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nation, who in 1906 (just five years after Federation) said this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `The best thing that Australians could do was to make the country so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive, so good a place to live, and bring about such just and fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions, with such  fair opportunities for earning an honest living,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such protection against monopolies, that other people would also want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become Australians.'
</em><br>
<p>Excellent. So a victim-disarming monopoly on the use of deadly force is prohibited, of course. Also, the monetary system shall not
<br>
be imposed by monopoly fiat: forcing nearly everyone to become bonded debt-slaves to the Statists/bankstas. These items, along with
<br>
income-tax slavery, monopoly public &quot;education&quot; (i.e. Statist indoctrination camps) and monopoly Social Security pyramid schemes are
<br>
some of the most demeaning, unjust, evils (meaning &quot;to cause harm&quot;) perpetuated by the protection racket occasionally referred to as
<br>
the State. I've never been down under, but I'd move there in a heartbeat if the above organized-crime schemes were absent.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ...He cites Peter Botsman, a left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretician, who argues that `part of the achievable answer... consists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not of condemning people to hopelessness, but of &quot;giving back control and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power to people and communities to solve their own problems&quot;. That, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schemes of enlightened volunteerism, of creative programs that will give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispossessed children access to a broader world, can rescue threatened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; families.' He continues with appeals to the fraternal and typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptical voluntarism of those who fight raging bush fires, which is akin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the heroism of the men in New York during the terrorist attacks, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that these people are not professionals.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This provides the flavor of Australian views; I would add (for what it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth, and because I was asked) that my own understanding of this sentiment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in theory and practice leans toward traditional anarchism, of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communitarian kind--the sort of mutual support that only free men and women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can offer each other.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree, though different words might be selected.
<br>
<p>Webster's 3rd-
<br>
communitarianism: n, a communal system of organization based on small (?) cooperative communities practicing some communist
<br>
principles.
<br>
<p>Communitarian Platform:
<br>
<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~ccps/RCPlatform.html">http://www.gwu.edu/~ccps/RCPlatform.html</a>
<br>
<p>is a gold-mine of distilled evil- I copped some of the phrases from this document for the earlier spoof on Neo-Feudalistic world
<br>
government, such as
<br>
&quot;...moral education and character formation...&quot;; &quot;...character formation and moral education...&quot;;
<br>
&quot;...A good citizen ...&quot;; &quot;...encouraging others to pay their fair share [to Massah']...&quot;; &quot;...national particularism ...&quot;;
<br>
<p>&quot;...Our communitarian concern may begin with ourselves and our families, but it rises inexorably to the long-imagined community of
<br>
humankind...&quot; code for &quot;let's conquer the world and impose H.G. Well's socialist dictatorship&quot;. World conquest and domination is an
<br>
inexorable force of nature in some minds.
<br>
<p>and my personal favorite-
<br>
<p>&quot;Those who neglect these duties, should be explicitly considered poor members of the community.&quot;
<br>
<p>Interestingly and tellingly, there is little difference between this platform and that of the German National Socialists (colloq.
<br>
&quot;Nazies&quot;) of the 1920's-1940's. Right and left-wings are two &quot;fuzzy&quot; faces of the same conceptual disfunction: Statism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't mistake that for socialism, or I'll have to order the Commissar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take you off to the Gulag.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the offer, sport, but I already live on or about the socialist shithole of Plantation USA, picking my &quot;fair share&quot; of
<br>
cotton for the greater grandeur of Massah'. I use Karl Marx's definition of socialism: the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto,
<br>
abolition of private property (slaves don't own property), dissolution of the family, etc., which is a fairly accurate,
<br>
funtionalistic description of the contemporary US System.
