<p><p>Ah, ok.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, we could get work-related benefits by saying we were married.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then we would be, and the IRS could make us file as a couple rather than as
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berkeley (I assume) we could get benefits if we were gay and registered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partners.  I don't know of any place where we've worked or lived where that's
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>The last time I was married it was optional whether you filed as 
<br>
married or as individual.  Perhaps this has changed?  I can't 
<br>
see why it would though or how or why they would track this.  I 
<br>
don't think it is that easy in SF unless you work for the city 
<br>
but I haven't checked into it recently.
