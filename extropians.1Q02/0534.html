</em><br>
<p>Been there.  Done that.  When I get to the meta level, and I decide to
<br>
procrastinate, I'm still in the meta level, and I realize my immediate
<br>
procrastination means infinite procrastination.  I.e., unless I start
<br>
*right now*, then given my history, I know I'll never start...and that,
<br>
alone, can be enough for &quot;now or never&quot;.
<br>
<p>I actually have more than one project that I am stretching out, getting
<br>
the joy of doing it in small pieces over years...but only because I know
<br>
I will do a little bit more if I have time, reinforced by the fact that
<br>
I *do* do a little bit more when I have time.  But the project has a
<br>
definite endpoint.
<br>
<p>And most of my projects have a time constraint outside of my life.  If I
<br>
do not do them within a certain, usually but not always long, stretch of
<br>
time (with a not-previously-known end time), they become irrelevant.
<br>
For instance, I could study up on biology and strive for a cure for all
<br>
forms of cancer, but it is likely that someone else will do so first,
<br>
thus I can safely delay doing so.  Likewise, it is probable that someone
<br>
will eventually make space travel practical for the general public;
<br>
there, however, I have a few advantages, and making it happen sooner
<br>
will aid many other things I wish to accomplish (if mainly because of
<br>
lower material prices from non-terrestrial mining and from the
<br>
possibility, in an extreme I hope never becomes necessary but which
<br>
seems more enticing every month, of establishing a refuge from Earth).
<br>
Therefore, I do actively push my shot at that along, even though I am
<br>
well aware of others doing the same thing in parallel.
<br>
<p>Which is not to say that deriving entertainment, even joy, from one's
<br>
own imagination is not a desirable skill.  (There are arguments against
<br>
that, but such would best be a separate thread.)  But deliberate
<br>
self-deception in this manner can not be made to last, not when one
<br>
makes very certain to stay connected to the truth, and the realities of
<br>
the world (including the fact of when, or if, one is going to do a
<br>
certain thing).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; life is ending and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't done what I wanted to do. Awful. But what if you're in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation in which there is no such time limit ?
</em><br>
<p>Like, say, where one of your constantly highest-priority projects is to
<br>
try to remove the time limit on life?  Once again: been there.  Done
<br>
that.  Still living it.  Even if the necessary resources *do* put aside
<br>
some things I might enjoy more in the short term.  ^_^
