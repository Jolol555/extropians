<p>The purpose of life is to take that which is not life, and to turn
<br>
it into life.
<br>
<p>The purpose of life is also to create more complex forms of life,
<br>
by creating us life has achieved consciousness.
<br>
<p>Life can now not only learn to understand itself, but has created
<br>
the best tool yet to help it achieve it's purpose.
<br>
<p>As part of life, our purpose is to help life create not only more
<br>
life, but to create more complex forms of life.
<br>
<p>Our life will have meaning when we work toward our true purpose.
<br>
<p>Our purpose in life is to help others.
