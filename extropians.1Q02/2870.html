<p>I'm wondering why chip companies are not looking at building MEMS

cooling systems into chips, and why they are not already designing
<br>
cooling ports into the chips. A number of evenly spaced venturi ports
<br>
across the chip face for the fan to draw air through should provide a
<br>
significant increase in cooling. As chip designs get thicker, this will
<br>
be a very necessary design feature.
<br>
<p>Dust buildup in the PC is easily compensated for by use of HEPA or
<br>
HEPA-like filtration on a positive pressure fan on the power supply.
<br>
<p>As for nano devices, well, I think that the designers will have to
<br>
figure out how to use lasing to cool them, though switching to optical
<br>
computation will go a long way to reducing thermal problems. Note that
<br>
heat is simply low grade photons, so a photonic chip that dumps high
<br>
energy photons after use should effectively reduce thermal noise.
