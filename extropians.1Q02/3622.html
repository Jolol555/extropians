<p><em>&gt; Rand's own irrationality was amply analyzed by Nathaniel Branden in an

<em>&gt; still have yet to hear anyone translate the human capacity for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptual processing or any other human need into a need for a &quot;natural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Who the heck is talking about &quot;natural *law*&quot;.  I am talking 
<br>
about natural *rights* deriving from the nature of the beings 
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Codified physical law&quot; is hand-waving.  There is the physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; universe which includes biology and evolution.  There are human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; concepts of same.  The map is not the territory.  A human concept is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; not a physical law (in fact, &quot;physical law&quot; is a merely a human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; concept - and there are scientists who are not so sure that there ARE 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;physical laws&quot; operative throughout the Universe).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Are you claiming that human beings hae no specific nature and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their nature does not lead to certain conditions being more optimal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for their well being, particularly concerning their interaction with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; other people and instutions of same?  You have to claim this if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are going to utterly dismiss the argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Physical laws are not the end and be all of what is real and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; important.  They are the basis of reality but do not utterly contain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everything in reality, if you see what I mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously I am not claiming anything of the sort - do not put words in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my mouth.  Of course humans have specific needs - what I am objecting to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the unnecessary transformation of a need into a mystical concept of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;right&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It is not obvious to date. Why switch from specific nature to 
<br>
specific needs?  They are not the same.  It is you that is 
<br>
asserting that rights are a mystical concept.  It is not a given 
<br>
for the discussion.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I already answered that question.  And the second one by implication. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It is a principle of Objectivism that rights are objective, derivable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from reality.  If so there is no multiplication of concepts beyond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; need.  What exactly would you base ethics on if not on some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; understanding of what is required for human beings to function 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; optiomally together?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have not answered the question except with more hand-waving.  It may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a principle of Objectivism, but they did not derive it logically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either except with hand-waving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Please clarify what would satisfy you as more than hand-waving 
<br>
in such a discussion.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am amused that some people few the notion of ethics as a given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential of the universe.  If something does not fit their &quot;ethics&quot;  
</em><br>
<p><p><p>The need for ethics grows out of the interaction of sentient 
<br>
beings like ourselves.  I don't know what &quot;given essential&quot; 
<br>
means to you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; they cannot comprehend why it exists.  To be precise, there is in fact 
</em><br>
<p><p>I have no idea what you are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; no need for ethics at all.  What is needed is a set of principles by 
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;In fact&quot;?  What facts are these?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which one can act in a social context and which provide the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likelihood of satisfying one's survival needs.  If you wish to call 
</em><br>
<p><p>This is what ethics are, including how one arrives at and 
<br>
validates such principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; these principles &quot;ethics&quot;, feel free.  I call them principles, so as not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to expand concepts beyond need and in the bargain burden a concept with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical baggage.
</em><br>
<p><p>Principles include many different things including those 
<br>
principles which are part of ethics.  Therefore the word 
<br>
&quot;principles&quot; is inadequate as it is not uniquely bound to this 
<br>
area of concern.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is a way of arriving at much the same thing.  You seem to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; quibbling more over semantics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not at all.  One concept is based on mysticism (&quot;rights&quot;), one on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrable economic analysis of the behavior of large groups of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  One concept is based on &quot;natural law&quot; - a meaningless concept - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and one is based on practical results - productivity or non-productivity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward a specific purpose - survival of the individual and the species.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>These are empty assertions of &quot;mysticism&quot; and &quot;natural law&quot; that 
<br>
I did not make.  You did.
