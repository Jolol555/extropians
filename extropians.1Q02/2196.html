<p>...How to stop machines enslaving humans
<br>
Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics at Reading University and author of 
<br>
the book March of the Machines, introduced a brainstorming salon at the 
<br>
Institute for Social Inventions in London in April 1998. He explained how 
<br>
computers and robots are already as intelligent as ants and that within 20 
<br>
years they will have a computational power far greater than the human brain 
<br>
and will be evolving at a far faster rate than humans.
<br>
<p>'Advanced machine beings likely to treat humans with as little consideration 
<br>
as we treat lower forms of life'. 
<br>
These advanced machine beings, with a consciousness of their own, are likely 
<br>
to treat humans with as little consideration as we treat lower forms of life, 
<br>
especially since the military are largely responsible for creating them. 
<br>
<p><p>'Within the lifetime of our children, Warwick believes, humans will become 
<br>
slaves who are culled, farmed and genetically interfered with'
<br>
The race to develop artificial intelligence systems is very difficult to 
<br>
halt. Within the lifetime of our children, Warwick believes, humans will 
<br>
become powerless slaves who are ruthlessly culled, farmed and genetically 
<br>
interfered with. 
<br>
<p><p>The brainstorming
<br>
The salon participants suspended any disbelief in this eventuality and 
<br>
brainstormed possible ways of preventing it happening. The normal 
<br>
brainstorming rules applied, with wild and crazy ideas all welcomed. Here is 
<br>
a sample of the suggestions: 
<br>
<p>Make a peace treaty with the robots, giving them total control of a planet of 
<br>
their own to live on, perhaps the moon, if that's not too close; or even just 
<br>
all underground parts of the planet, since they may not require daylight.
<br>
<p>Intensively train a James-Bond-style team capable of destroying robots at the 
<br>
first sign of hostile intent.
<br>
<p>Develop gradually enlarging Computer Free Zones which are utterly free of 
<br>
dependence on computer systems.......
