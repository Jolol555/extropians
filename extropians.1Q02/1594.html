<p>Not really.  With sufficiently robust MNT money to &quot;survive&quot; is not a
<br>
problem.  Humans are 100W machines (the brain itself only ~15W.
<br>
Typical solar insolation is ~200-400W per sq. m.   Allowing for
<br>
conversion efficiency issues, a human can &quot;survive&quot; on only
<br>
a few sq. m of land.
<br>
<p>I'll state this quite clearly and keep repeating it until people get it.
<br>
With robust MNT &quot;survival&quot; *IS NOT A PROBLEM*.
<br>
<p>Now, it becomes more difficult if one begins to identify ones &quot;survival&quot;
<br>
with having a Mercedes, Carribean Vacation homes, etc. but probably not
<br>
*too* much more.  This has been addressed in Nanomedicine.  Everyone
<br>
on the planet can reasonably operate 10 kg of nano-replicators.  So
<br>
you can build approximatly 10 kg of nano-stuff per hour.  The nano-santas
<br>
don't come every day, but it is not unreasonable to expect some really
<br>
cool stuff for Christmas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The first uploads and maintained will probably be expensive.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  It will be expensive to develop the first upload.  But once developed
<br>
making it available to large numbers of people should not take more than
<br>
a few years.  I don't think you will see people screaming to get uploaded
<br>
provided Robin's uploaded hyperevolution scenario is constrained.  Given
<br>
the other paths that are likely to be available -- remaining in a non-aging
<br>
body or becoming cyborgized, I think only some fraction of humanity may
<br>
opt for uploading.
<br>
<p>One critical factor will be whether uploads are allowed exponentially
<br>
growing abilities.  If they have a &quot;hardwired&quot; fundamental respect for
<br>
other sentience and/or external systems that constrain the resources
<br>
(power &amp; matter) available to them, then the situation is manageable.
<br>
If they are autonomous agents allowed to run around the planet and
<br>
self-evolve, then they could be dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The first problem will be with thieves who can't afford the technology.
</em><br>
Everyone will be able to afford it if you have an open source design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There will be cases of people stealing storage nodes so they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delete the previous occupant and upload themselves.
</em><br>
<p>If the &quot;node&quot; weighs less than 10 kg, they you can make one in an hour.
<br>
Its worth noting here, a 1 cm^3 Drexlerian nanocomputer (weighing slightly
<br>
more than a sugar cube), consuming 100,000W (requiring a 50x50 m plot of
<br>
land for power) provides the computational capacity equivalent to 100K to
<br>
1 million human minds (using computational equivalence as a measure).
<br>
If you go down to a lower level and are doing a simulation of a human
<br>
mind at the neuron level (this is a differential equation simulation of
<br>
each individual neuron) then using current computer architectures
<br>
you might need 3 Drexlerian nanocomputers per &quot;mind&quot;.
<br>
<p>So I don't see any need to postulate a need to steal energy or hardware
<br>
from others unless it turns out that that to properly support a human
<br>
mind you have to drop down to the level of a full molecular dynamics
<br>
simulation at the atomic level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It will cost money to be stored.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  You have your nanoreplicators build you a space ship and send
<br>
yourself into orbit around the sun.  It doesn't cost anything other
<br>
than the materials required for the original investment in the
<br>
computronium and space ship.  (Obviously space ships for 1 cm^3
<br>
nanocomputers can be pretty small...).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you are stored, and cannot touch the real world, how many of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could still make money?  I don't know if I could.
</em><br>
<p>You make money in the virtual world.  The real world is so slow and
<br>
behind the times that dealing with it will be pretty undesirable.
<br>
But since you are living off &quot;free&quot; energy, you don't need money
<br>
unless there is a market where you want to buy closed-source
<br>
designs for self-enhancement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most of my money comes from programming on top-secret projects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those projects do not allow data in or out.
</em><br>
<p>Well this situation might develop between the uploaded virtual
<br>
reality and what is left of the &quot;real&quot; reality on Earth.  But
<br>
so long as there is mutual respect for one another it isn't
<br>
really a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone who touches the real world, like a doctor or athlete,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will no longer be able to work at their profession.
</em><br>
<p>I've given a Continuing Medical Education seminar to doctors about
<br>
Nanomedicine.  One of them raised this question asking &quot;what will
<br>
doctors do?&quot;  My answer was that they would become &quot;managers&quot; of the
<br>
nanomedical devices.  As far as athletes go, they become irrelevant
<br>
(competition based on &quot;natural&quot; genetic abilities is *really* dumb)
<br>
or money will be spent on genetic enhancements instead of salaries or
<br>
they become cyborgized or lay claim to the all-&quot;natural&quot; sports or they
<br>
get &quot;handicapped&quot; just like horses or golfers do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may find that once your body is destroyed, current laws will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant you rights.
</em><br>
<p>If you are an uploaded copy on a spaceship orbiting the sun you don't
<br>
really have to worry about whether the laws of some enclave &quot;grant
<br>
you rights&quot;.  You only have to worry whether some enclave will take
<br>
action to destroy you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may not be able to stop the body-survivors from turning you off,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely for no other reason than they do not believe that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really in the machine.
</em><br>
<p>For &quot;uploading&quot; to really work people are going to have to accept the
<br>
fact that &quot;you&quot; are really in the machine.  You would obviously pass
<br>
the Turing Test (as poor as it is).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is also another reason that many people will not choose survival.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not because they don't want to survive, but because they don't see it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival at all.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this.  Many people will consider themselves &quot;humans&quot;
<br>
and will not want to up-evolve.
