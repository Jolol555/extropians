<p>Huh?  Facts not in evidence.
<br>
<p>If you are talking about &quot;Probability One&quot;, I've read it and
<br>
while I would agree that it makes a strong argument, for the
<br>
argument to be completely valid, one has to believe the universe
<br>
has an infinite number of planets and I doubt most scientists
<br>
would accept that.
<br>
<p>In fact arguments like &quot;Rare Earth&quot; and the recent article by
<br>
Dar &amp; DeRujala re: Gamma-Ray Bursts point out how difficult
<br>
long term survival in the universe may really be.  If those
<br>
were taken into account in books like &quot;Probability One&quot;, its
<br>
arguments would be *much* weaker.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it's contact that counts as disruptive, it's contact that Shermer

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry J.R. but that is utter ca-ca.  Very serious scientists,
<br>
both biologists, astrobiologists, chemists, physicists, etc. now know
<br>
that the molecular basis for &quot;life&quot; is abundant in the gas and
<br>
dust clouds of our galaxy.  The material in these clouds condenses
<br>
into stars and planets.  It would not be &quot;disruptive&quot; to &quot;rigorous reason&quot;
<br>
or the &quot;laws of physical science&quot; to discover that &quot;life&quot; similar to that
<br>
on the Earth had evolved from the conditions currently known to exist.
<br>
&quot;Contact with ETI&quot; is a natural result of the evolution (and survival(!))
<br>
of life and intelligence and would hardly be &quot;disruptive&quot; for science.
<br>
It would be more disruptive for those religions that believe the
<br>
myth that the entire point of &quot;creation&quot; is &quot;humanity&quot; as its
<br>
central focus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a nutshell: If ETI is smart enough to be able to visit Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it's smart enough to initiate a technological phase transition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would in turn render it an extra-terrestrial super-intelligence (ETSI),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus explaining the absence of any (human-detectable) contact with it.
</em><br>
<p>I'll agree with this.  ETSIs are undetectable using our current technologies.
<br>
They may be on the Earth, on the moon, in the solar system or far far
<br>
away.  In all cases we have not sufficiently searched the physical space
<br>
with sufficiently robust technologies to reduce the probability of their
<br>
existence in those spaces to zero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Religionists could simply equate ETI to &quot;angels&quot; or &quot;spirits.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Why?  I doubt anyone of the &quot;religionist&quot; perspective, upon meeting
<br>
and having a serious conversation with a &quot;Vulcan&quot; or a &quot;Klingon&quot;
<br>
would believe them to be either &quot;angels&quot; or &quot;spirits&quot;.  Instead
<br>
a substantial readjustment of an Earth-/antropo-/centric perspective
<br>
of &quot;God's interests&quot; or &quot;the purpose of creation&quot; would most likely
<br>
result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Scientists, whose rationalism has no recourse to such inanities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be at a loss to explain ETI contact (which ain't gonna
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen, so don't worry about it).
</em><br>
<p>More ca-ca.  As a very serious individual, I discount the
<br>
probability of &quot;contact&quot; because there is no point to it.
<br>
The &quot;Star Trek&quot; paradigm is a nice story if faster-than-light
<br>
travel is possible.  It doesn't currently appear to be, so it
<br>
should be heavily discounted.  I do however believe that &quot;detection&quot;
<br>
may be feasible.  As our technological abilities increase (approaching
<br>
the limits allowed by physical laws) we develop greater and greater
<br>
abilities to state with certainty that we know life does
<br>
exist &quot;here&quot; and does not exist &quot;there&quot;.  Witness &quot;A hydrogen-based
<br>
subsurface microbial community dominated by methanogens&quot;,
<br>
Nature 415:312-315 (2002) some 200 m underground.  This is
<br>
*not* someplace that scientists would have expected to find
<br>
&quot;life&quot; 20-30 years ago.  But as science becomes more aware
<br>
of the power of evolution it expands its perspectives of
<br>
where life may survive and intelligence may develop.
<br>
I doubt you would find many serious scientists who would
<br>
argue that it is &quot;impossible&quot; for *intelligence* to evolve
<br>
within a microbial community.  We just don't know enough
<br>
about intelligence to claim that.
<br>
<p>So science would not be surprised or wounded by &quot;contact&quot;
<br>
with ETI.  Some religions on the other hand might need
<br>
a serious adjustment of perspective.
