Eliezer S. Yudkowsky wrote (27.2.2002/11:57) :
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course historical information about Socrates is terribly spotty, and most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mine is secondhand, so I can't cite specific sources.  Nonetheless, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secondhand understanding is that - for example - Socrates himself never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claimed to know what happens after death (a reasonable belief in that age,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when nobody knew what the heck was going on), while Plato makes him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue, using various blatantly spurious analogies, for a knowable life after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death.  This is what I mean by pointing out the difference between Plato's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Socrates&quot; and the real Socrates.  I think I would have liked to meet the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real Socrates, who argued for progress in knowledge through doubt and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioning, and defended objective truth against the assaults of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sophists.  A terrible pity that Plato stole his name and reputation.
</em><br>
<p>Were it not for Plato, perhaps Socrates would only be a footnote in
<br>
Greek history...
<br>
<p>You are doing what Plato did: pick someone who wrote nothing, and of
<br>
whom little is known, and safely inject in him your own values...
<br>
<p>My own impression is that the real Socrates must have been, more than
<br>
anything else, someone who argues in a systematically corrosive way.
<br>
<p>If you are mentally more agile than you interlocutor, and unafraid of
<br>
consequences, you can easily question his or her beliefs, ask &quot;why&quot;
<br>
endlessly, check for consistency, offer alternative at some points in
<br>
which he seems constrained to choose, etc.
<br>
<p>Socrates would do that with young people of good families on the
<br>
agora, perhaps leveraging their typically adolescent curiosity and
<br>
tendency to question socially accepted beliefs, and have themselves
<br>
&quot;demonstrate&quot; the emptiness and lack of final justification of social
<br>
beliefs and behaviour, including the projects their parents had for
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>It's a rather manipulative business, with limited &quot;knowledge value&quot;.
<br>
He routinely insisted he knew nothing, and apparently he didn't mind,
<br>
which is telling. Saying you don't know anything makes it impossible
<br>
for people to ask you questions, and to return your weapon onto
<br>
yourself. You're the one who asks, with that above-average command you
<br>
have of logical walking (but nothing else in your hands).
<br>
<p>Socrates was known to be &quot;very ugly&quot;, he walked barefoot, and he had
<br>
probably given up on traditional social integration. One could
<br>
speculate that having nothing to loose on that side, he rose his
<br>
status by provocation, and by making dubious (to their own eyes) what
<br>
people believed, through some rounds of justification asking,
<br>
leaving them with nothing but confusion -- and the impression that
<br>
Socrates was superiorly wise.
<br>
<p>I offer as a wild speculation that Plato misunderstood Socrates'
<br>
attitude. He was fascinated by the power and purity of such thought
<br>
(that dispenses with the messy reality), and, unaware of the social
<br>
meaning of Socrates' attitude, adopted such purity as method. He thus
<br>
bore the pure fruit of logical reasonning, which is a metaphysics
<br>
echoing language, and the dismissal of reality (too messy).
<br>
<p>When I read Phaedo, though very young, I was shocked at how *plain
<br>
bad* many arguments are (which is probably what you refer to,
<br>
Eliezer). So you have that man who is going to die, spending his last
<br>
moment with his friends, and they actually wander in the maze of
<br>
logical implication. There is something very pathetic in it.
<br>
<p>If my speculation is right, by the way, while most other dialogs may
<br>
have happen in a somewhat similar way, this one is probably totally
<br>
invented, being meaningful to Plato, but not likely to be as
<br>
meaningful to Socrates. This is further confirmed by the fact that
<br>
contrary to most other dialogues, here Socrates seems the one
<br>
defending an opinion and being attacked.
<br>
<p>About the people having attended the dialogue, the prologue has a
<br>
playful and mysterious remark :
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;ECHECRATES. Who were present?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;PHAEDO. Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Critobulus and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and Antisthenes; likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Menexenus, and some others; but Plato, if I am not mistaken, was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ill.
<br>
<p>Phaedo
