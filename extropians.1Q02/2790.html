<em>&gt;From <a href="mailto:Jill@ramonsky.com?Subject=Re:%20SECURITY%20WARNING:%20%20love%20warning%20is%20a%20HOAX!%20%20Do%20not%20delete%20this%20file!">Jill@ramonsky.com</a>

Subject: Security warning
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old hoax that is making the rounds again.  I have seen a dozen 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;instances of this in the last 24 hours. It seems to happen round about 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;February 14th every year. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING! The message about the human emotion &quot;love&quot; being a virus is 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a HOAX. The message tricks you into thinking that you have a virus and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;asks you to delete a part of your brain normally found in human operating 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;systems. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have already deleted this file, you can get it back from your 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;upload backup following the directions found here: 
<br>

<em>  &gt; I had this in my brain!!!!  You probably have it on yours!!!!! 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; I have picked up a virus that is transmitted automatically via human 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; interaction.  Because I have interacted with you, it means that you're 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; likely to have the virus. 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; The virus is called &quot;love&quot;. It is not detected by intelligence or common sense, 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; and lies dormant undefinitely until it strikes, at which point it is capable of 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; causing irrational behaviour, and ultimately of closing down your 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; entire system.  The attached letter is 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; a simple yet effective method of finding and deleting the virus before it 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; can do you any harm.  Please act PROMPTLY! 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; the directions for removing it are easy. 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 1.  Go into biofeedback mode then find or search (depending on your computer) 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 2. Search for the amygdala. 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 3.  In the &quot;look in&quot; make sure you are searching the area around the hypothalmus. 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 4.  Hit &quot;search&quot; button (or find). 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 5.  If this structure shows up (it's a small blobby thing that will have the 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; name (amygdala)  DO NOT USE IT!!!!! 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 6.  Delete this brain structure 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 7.  It will ask you if you want to send it to the recycle bin-say yes 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 8.  Go to your frontal lobes and double click on the recycle bin. 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 9.  Right click on emotion and delete again- empty the bin. 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; If you find it send this information to everyone you come in contact with 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; because that's the way it's transferred. 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; Happy Valentine's Day
