<p>It's not just you, and it's not just genetics.  I find that in all my
<br>
different areas of expertise, the technical details discussed on this list
<br>
are wrong most the time.  I am really beginning to believe that for area of
<br>
study there is a large complex body of knowledge, and an incomplete
<br>
simplified model that is given to the public.
<br>
<p>The two do not match up.  Things simply don't work the way we think they do.
<br>
There is too much information for us to understand it all.  Scientists, news
<br>
media, teachers, books all give us a simplified and incomplete view to give
<br>
us an idea about things, but so many details are left out that we really
<br>
could not make them work right if we tried.
<br>
<p>I hope I'm not just being depressing, but there really is a difference
<br>
between common knowledge and real expertise.  It takes years to get a handle
<br>
on most areas, and reading Usenet for a few years is not the same thing.  I
<br>
think this is why most experts do not participate in these online
<br>
discussions.  They are so far removed from their real area of study that
<br>
there is no point in getting involved.
