Crayfish Robots On Mars? 
<br>
<p>Australian scientists are using a humble indigenous freshwater crayfish, 
<br>
known as the Yabby, as their inspiration to help build miniature robots for 
<br>
NASA's exploration of Mars. Platoons of robo-yabbies could soon explore the 
<br>
red planet searching for water or conducting chemical analysis of the 
<br>
atmosphere and the planet's crust - tasks that are currently impractical for 
<br>
humans. University of Melbourne zoologist, Professor David Macmillan and 
<br>
associates in his Melbourne laboratory and collaborating laboratories 
<br>
overseas are using the Yabby (Cherax destructor) to help advance research in 
<br>
the global movement called biomimetics. The movement is a rapidly expanding 
<br>
area of research that harvests nature's best design ideas for use in 
<br>
robotics. &quot;Invertebrates such as insects and crustaceans achieve similar 
<br>
movement and sensory outcomes to humans. For example, finding food and 
<br>
selection of appropriate mates and nesting sites. Where humans use millions 
<br>
of neurons to achieve such outcomes, invertebrates do it with thousands. 
<br>
Where humans use hundreds, invertebrates may use as few as six,&quot; he says. &quot;It 
<br>
is this parsimony, that ability to control complex behaviours with an 
<br>
amazingly small amount of brain power that attracts scientists from 
<br>
disciplines including robotics engineering, computer programming, biology, 
<br>
mathematics and neurology.&quot; Advances in computational network modeling, and 
<br>
electronics have permitted development of a bizarre new class of truly 
<br>
biomimetic beasts. But it isn't as easy as merely taking apart an animal or 
<br>
plant and copying what you see. &quot;Evolution doesn't always come up with the 
<br>
best solution from an engineer's perspective,&quot; says Professor Macmillan. 
<br>
Despite these evolutionary pitfalls, biomimetics has already produced 
<br>
swimming robots that achieve propulsion by whole body undulations or tail 
<br>
flapping and robots that walk using multiple jointed legs to mediate 
<br>
locomotion. Inroads are even being made in flying robots that fly by flapping 
<br>
mechanical wings. Professor Macmillan has focused his research on the Yabby's 
<br>
powerful tail, and it has revealed some interesting implications for future 
<br>
robotic design.
