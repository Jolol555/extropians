</em><br>
<p>Why Harvey, do you have such an aversion to libertarianism? It is
<br>
certainly NOT an anti-humanist philosophy. Some would say that it is the
<br>
most essentially humanist philosophy due to its dedication to the
<br>
individual human, and not to more abstract constructs such as society,
<br>
culture, and government. It is, in fact, those philosophies which focus
<br>
more on the importance of the latter than the individual which are more
<br>
anti-humanist than libertarianism.
<br>
<p>It was, in fact Hayek's defense of classical enlightenment principles of
<br>
humanism against the 'man is a cog in the machine' antihumanism of
<br>
Keynes and Marx that led to the development of modern libertarianism, as
<br>
people such as Greg Burch have observed here in the past.
<br>
<p>While I completely understand Max's aversion to the sort of blanket
<br>
dismissal of libertarians by western intelligentsia as &quot;randite robber
<br>
barons and pot legalizers&quot; that would occur if ExI were unabashedly
<br>
libertarian (not to mention being pummelled by Objectivists demanding
<br>
dogmatic adherence to the Great Ayn Way), I think that ExI has a long
<br>
way to go before it has anywhere near the level of respectability that
<br>
groups like the Cato Institute and others of the modern
<br>
libertarian/conservative side of things posess. One does not gain
<br>
respect by being meek or mild, it comes from standing forthrightly for
<br>
one's principles, trumpeting them to the world, and not disavowing those
<br>
who would be better and truer friends than those who claim to wear the
<br>
modern mantle of humanism.
