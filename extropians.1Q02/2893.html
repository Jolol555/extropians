<p>The Good Professor queries:
<br>
&lt;&lt; Suppose a nanocivilization sent out nanobots aboard a von Neumann probe (or
<br>
&nbsp;otherwise) to our &quot;lovely&quot; planet. Their mission is to destroy any evidence
<br>
&nbsp;gathered by humans of the galactic civilization that in fact exists out
<br>
&nbsp;there. Is this scenario physically possible?  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The simple answer is no. There is not one piece of evidence that such a 
<br>
nanobot does exist, nor does it appear likely, in the case of a &quot;ufo&quot; that 
<br>
memory munchers would be actively, altering human neurochemicals, after a 
<br>
close encounter. First why have such a close encounter in the 1st place, and 
<br>
secondly, why even bother to go to the trouble of alteriing photographic 
<br>
plates, for distant encounters?
<br>
<p>For instance: Let us say that a supercivilization announces its existence to 
<br>
earth savages.
<br>
<p>Supers: We exist!
<br>
<p>Earth Savages:
<br>
A:  Cool!
<br>
<p><p>B: 
<br>
You have offended our sense of being the centrality of life in the Cosmos! No 
<br>
mater how advanced you are, no matter how long it takes, we will obliterate 
<br>
you and all your kind in order to restore the &quot;natural&quot; balance!!! All your 
<br>
base are belong to us!*
<br>
<p>Supers to A: Can you dig it? We knew that you could! Here's a cosmic 
<br>
carepackage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Supers to B: Yes, we know you be a bunch of idiots. Thanks for the warning. 
<br>
Here is  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a nice, juicy, meteorite to suck on. Enjoy your new stone 
<br>
age, losers!
<br>
<p>Or                Yeah, we knew you'd over-react, however, by the time you 
<br>
get to some 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really advanced technology, that might threaten us, 
<br>
you'll be forced to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adapt to ouyr mostly, peaceful, ways, just to implement 
<br>
such powerful 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology.     
<br>
<p>B: again        By that time, we will have even weapons even more fearsome 
<br>
and   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effective, then what we possess now! You jokers are just 
<br>
a bunch of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;piss ants howling from the tree branches that spawned 
<br>
you. Grow up! 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Another related place the meme snatcher conjecture is relevant is in
<br>
connection with Nick Bostrom's simulation argument.
<br>
<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a> I pointed out in the initial round of
<br>
the discussion of this argument that it is simply a special case of the more
<br>
general principle that we might be created by others. Thus, one way to make
<br>
our world is to do it in a computer simulation, another would be to create a
<br>
physical world and populate it with created humans. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I have read Dr. Bostrom's thesis several times, and still can't saavy why he 
<br>
believes the world is a simmulation. In a simm, there less need for 
<br>
tactillity (tactile-ness) and embeded data. Embeded, as in the 
<br>
deeper(smaller) one has researched, the more info one can produce. Similarly 
<br>
the farther out one ventures into space, also results in more, richer data. A 
<br>
simm, by necessity, would merely have a gridwork of data, enoug, merely to 
<br>
support the simm.  If there is more data, as I state that there is, then we 
<br>
do not have a simm, but possibly a genuine, created universe; perhaps created 
<br>
Andrei Linde style.             
<br>
<p>On another matter, your conference on Practical Cosmology, perhaps needs to 
<br>
include something like Existential Cosmology, touching upon meaning, or 
<br>
pain-relief, (at least!). I remember reading John Leslie's books (Professor 
<br>
at the U of Guelph) which covered this issue, a bit.
