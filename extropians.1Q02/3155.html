<em>&gt; Overall, an enjoyable little website. There should really be more sites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this for other questions (right now I'm reading a book about the

</em><br>
<p>I enjoyed that too--and I hope we do see more of that kind of
<br>
thing on the net.  Seeing more philosophy without long, dry, texts
<br>
is avery good thing.
<br>
<p>The site maintainer is also very friendly and responsive: I didn't
<br>
have to bit a bullet, but I did take one hit, for answering &quot;true&quot; to
<br>
question 7 and &quot;false&quot; to question 15, which they claim is inconsistent.
<br>
I pointed out that those questions are vague enough to allow perfectly
<br>
consistent philosophies to answer that way, and he agreed. He said he
<br>
would be working on rewording the questions to get around that problem,
<br>
but that it was tricky because every question has side-effects on some
<br>
others.  In short, he seemed very interested in making it a rigorous
<br>
test, and not just some off-the-cuff Cosmo-love-test kind of thing.
