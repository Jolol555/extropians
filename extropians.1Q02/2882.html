<em>&gt; &gt; At its core, all world wars have been over which is superior: lies

</em><br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which historical texts describe the First World War as a history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialism vs. human liberty? Fact: The predominant powers involved all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held territories and colonies that were viewed   by participants at the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as imperial structures. The powers that fought each other included the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British Empire, the German Empire, the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Japanese Empire. The First World War was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a conflict against imperialism; it was a war between empires and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations. If you want to simplify such a complex history, you might view it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a battle between empire and nation, within its European context.
</em><br>
<p>But did imperialism survive WWI? Not really, and Wilson's lobbying and
<br>
public speaking pretty much killed the whole concept at wars end and
<br>
following. The carnage produced by the war between imperialists
<br>
convinced enough people that imperialism was a dumb idea, and the fact
<br>
that the US was needed to end the war helped put the nails in the
<br>
coffin.
<br>
Wilson began the movement for internation recognition of human rights as
<br>
something beyond the ability or right of governments to oppress. That it
<br>
took till the end of WWII for this to come to fruition is only proof of
<br>
the maxim that who wins wars is really only decided by the next war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Countries would not go to war against each other if one side or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other were not lying about their point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you wish to view a war in terms of the ideologies expressed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participants, how do you distinguish between their ideas and the propaganda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created in support of their point of view? Propaganda is a natural tool of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any nation at war and all sides lie about their intentions and their goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least, any country at war has done this so far.
</em><br>
<p>Propaganda, per se, is not always a lie. There are two forms of
<br>
propaganda: information and disinformation. One is truth, the other is
<br>
falsehood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In this faith versus reason war, you have various faiths: in god, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power, in a romantic vision of some arcadian or andelusian period, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; golden age in the past. snip...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you wish to view history through this construct of faith versus reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and it is not an interpretation that appears to have a great deal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanatory force), then surely you should note that one of the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vehicles of faith since 1789 has been nationalism. Faith in one's nation has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been the motive for evil atrocities up to and including genocide. Would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add the nationalist to your list?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. However, nationalism being wrong and false does not mean that
<br>
everything it involves is automatically false (just as a KKK member can
<br>
still tell the truth when he says the sky is blue). Objectively ranking
<br>
one form of polity as objectively better than another is significantly
<br>
different from having blind faith in one's nation, right or wrong.
