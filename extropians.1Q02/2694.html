</em><br>
<p>I agree with the information aspect here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also not explained whether it is possible to ignore the advice
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the AI in the above scenario. If it is, I see no ethical problem with
</em><br>
it
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; case the issue becomes whether this system actually manages to
</em><br>
maximize
<br>
<em>&gt; utility).
</em><br>
<p>There's a presumption, in the quote, that the AI knows best period.  If
<br>
that were so, fine.  But how would we know it is so?  The problem of how
<br>
evaluates the AI comes up -- and this is no different than say turning
<br>
over our freedom to any benevolent dictator, group, or party.
<br>
<p>The promises that such an AI will only think of our interests because
<br>
its own have been suppressed and because it's designed to have no
<br>
emotions or values seems silly to me.  Once it has the power, how will
<br>
one keep it from morphing into something else -- something with
<br>
interests antithetical to those it has power over?
<br>
<p>This is not to say I stand against AI.  I do not.  But I don't believe
<br>
in giving more intelligent beings control over my life period -- be they
<br>
just people with ten more IQ points than me and two PhDs or
<br>
superintelligent passionless machines.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
