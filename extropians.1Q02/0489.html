Dossy Shiobara  opined:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Read the first 3 paragraphs.  Then, tell me how not feasible
<br>
my scenario really is.&gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>While the article itself spoke with peacenik and neopeacenik(s) Sorenson, and 
<br>
McNamara, who themselves commented on the claims in Bamford's book:           
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;&quot;I've never heard of Operation Northwoods. Never heard of it and don't 
<br>
believe it,&quot; said Theodore Sorenson, Kennedy's White House special counsel. 
<br>
&quot;Obviously, it would be totally illegal as well as totally unwise.&quot;
<br>
<p>Robert S. McNamara, Kennedy's defense secretary, said: &quot;I never heard of it. 
<br>
I can't believe the chiefs were talking about or engaged in what I would call 
<br>
CIA-type operations.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bamford writes that besides the Joint Chiefs, then-Assistant Secretary of 
<br>
Defense Paul H. Nitze also favored &quot;provoking a phony war with Cuba.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;There may be a piece of paper&quot; on Northwoods, said McNamara. &quot;I just cannot 
<br>
conceive of [Nitze] approving anything like that or doing it without talking 
<br>
to me.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Spudboy the abyss-gazer concludes:
<br>
<p>Your hypothesis is unlikely in the case of 9-11 based on this book. The 
<br>
crazziness of the middle east, combined with the trouble-making instigated by 
<br>
the Saudi ruling class is more likely as a cause of the Afghan War.  
<br>
<p>Quoting Tevye from Fiddler of the Roof: &quot;If your rich, they think you really 
<br>
know..&quot;
<br>
The Saudis (wahabbis) are rich but they are generally merchants with the good 
<br>
grace to have oil under their sandy homeland. Sales people can be clever 
<br>
and/or very stupid. The Wahabbis have made big trouble for us with their 
<br>
funding of propaganda centers for Islamic terror, namely religious schools, 
<br>
universities, mosques, etc. They have probably screwed with the wrong people, 
<br>
in this case. Or maybe America is content enough not to pursue the terrorists 
<br>
to their center, and I don't mean Iraq. Or is that a conspiracy too? :-)
