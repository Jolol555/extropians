<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;Mike's original post and Amara's response&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike's response to Amara
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I did not once advocate throwing drug users in jail, did I?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nor did I say that an individual shouldn't be free to drug themselves as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they see fit, or even suicide. I am fully in support of the individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to choose such activities, SO LONG as those activities do not harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HOWEVER: From my experience in working with drug addicts, and my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the physiology of addiction, it is my opinion that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who becomes addicted to a drug is no longer fully in posession
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their ability to freely make choices or decisions. At some point, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no longer the person making the decisions, the drug is (or rather, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the drug has warped their minds physiologically and psychologically).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drug addicts commit acts that they know are wrong, that they claim they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want to do, but are compelled to do so in order to get high again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such individuals are no longer freely acting adult citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, their acts in pursuit of the next high generally involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causing harm or damage or death to other people and their property:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children and spouses, business associates, creditors, neighbors, etc..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For this reason, the claims that drug use is a 'victimless crime' is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as black and white, slam dunk as many legalization proponents would like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to claim. Having been in the trenches of dealing with addicts, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage they do ALWAYS extends beyond themselves as individuals, as is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be expected when an individual abdicates responsibility for themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an inanimate substance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nor did I say that civil forfeiture worked particularly well at what its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended purpose is. It actually works rather badly, doing more to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enrich police departments and their officers than helping the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims of drug addiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I have much more sympathy for this than I did a few years ago (although I am
<br>
still uneasy about the sub-Kantian idea that your &quot;higher self&quot; is disabled
<br>
by the habit), particularly in the light of the research Brian (I think it
<br>
was) mentioned about the sector of any population which has a genetic
<br>
sensitivity to specific substances. So simply saying &quot;everyone do what they
<br>
want and let the chips fall where they may&quot; shouldn't be an option. The hard
<br>
question is what is the best thing to do? As you say civil forfeiture and
<br>
other aspects of the drug war are not helping (and make things worse in many
<br>
ways). They are also creating desperately dangerous precedents and
<br>
incentives for law enforcers. Perhaps we can learn from the way alcohol
<br>
abuse was reduced in Britain, from being a widespread, very severe problem
<br>
in the 1840s and earlier to being a relatively minor problem by the 1890s,
<br>
through things like education, social pressure, regulation and the use of
<br>
fiscal policy.  I think you have to accept you can't get rid of the problem
<br>
entirely, it's a matter of getting it to an &quot;acceptable&quot; level. The key
<br>
calculation must be a cost/benefit analysis where you trade off the costs of
<br>
drug use (the externalities you describe) against the costs of prohibition
<br>
(such as loss of liberty, corruption of the criminal justice system, growth
<br>
of organised crime). Steve Davies
