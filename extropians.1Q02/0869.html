<em>&gt; But JR, twisted metal, chainsaws and jets of flame are inherently appealing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wicked cool.  It has all the elements of good entertainment: engineering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical struggle, humor, destruction, etc.  I am astounded we got all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to 1998 before someone figured out how to make money with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things.  {8-]  spike
</em><br>
<p>You got that right, Spike. Ain't no &quot;buts&quot; about it. When someone figures out
<br>
how to make money with *anything* that's when it really takes off. Eventually
<br>
someone will figure out how to make money with human-competitive AI robots,
<br>
and that will be the last thing  anyone will need to figure out. Incidentally,
<br>
do you suppose anyone will figure out how to make money with the Extropy
<br>
Institute?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Keep watching this robot wars.  We are right on the edge of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something an order of magnitude more interesting and worrisome:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a version of robot wars where the battlebots must be entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autonomous, preprogrammed to attack and defend.  When they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start getting good at that, perhaps we could make the game so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is some meta-goal, such as having each bot gather randomly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scattered stones into a goal box.  The others try to stop that while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling their own goal boxes.
</em><br>
<p>More worrisome yet: A robot that figures out how to make robot wars
<br>
interesting to humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps bots would learn to form temporary alliances, smash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other guy, rob each other's goal boxes, etc, then fight among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.  Pretty soon they might start acting not so different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from humans.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as you may know, the only thing on TV that's bigger than Robot Wars is
<br>
Wrestling.
<br>
Nevertheless, I see robotics moving toward helpful services, as rescue
<br>
workers, firefighters, surgeons, and other useful things more than just a
<br>
spectator sport.
<br>
<p>&quot;You'll learn to like robots.
<br>
They'll be nicer than human beings.&quot;

<p><em>&gt; We are on the verge of making up sports that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way more entertaining than watching 22 overpaid galoots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggling to kick a pigskin obelisk thru goal posts.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, what's entertaining to *us* doesn't necessarily play well on
<br>
TV, which is directed at an audience of approximately eighth grade level (and
<br>
comparable galoots).

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
