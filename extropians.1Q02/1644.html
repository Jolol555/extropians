To be honest, it's still a little too early to tell what happened at
<br>
Enron.  The kind of up to the minute reporting that's going on now
<br>
probably won't add much to our knowledge.  We'll have to wait until a
<br>
few investigations are finished and evaluated.
<br>
<p>That said, I didn't feel Roland Watson's &quot;Greed&quot; (at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/watson/watson30.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/watson/watson30.html</a>) was an attempt to
<br>
absolve the executives from their responsibilities or to wrap them in
<br>
the capitalist flag.  Early in the article, he states that he is &quot;not
<br>
focussing here on the dubious practises of the executives and
<br>
accountants related to Enron, we'll leave them to the judicial processes
<br>
of the land.&quot;  He goes on to say he wants to &quot;simply comment that those
<br>
who demand that the government bail out the 401K pension holders are
<br>
wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p>In that area, I agree with him.  The government shouldn't take the
<br>
taxpayers' money to bail out pensioners from Enron.  That Enron might
<br>
have broken laws or &quot;the rules&quot; is another matter, but even if Enron
<br>
did, this doesn't make the taxpayers responsible for making up the
<br>
difference.  If someone defrauds you, the person to seek damages from is
<br>
the fraudulent person -- not everyone else in society.  Granted, you
<br>
might not be able to recover everything -- which is, sadly, likely the
<br>
case here -- but that does not give you a blank check on people who had
<br>
no responsibility in the matter -- the taxpayers.
<br>
<p>Add to this that this is the same old song of investors -- here,
<br>
employees of Enron -- wanting the government to bail them out for bad
<br>
investments.  In the long run, by not bailing these people out, more
<br>
people will become cautious about their retirement accounts.  (The same
<br>
should be applied to other incidents of bailing out investors, such as
<br>
the bailout of LTCM -- where the initial investors all walked away with
<br>
fat wads of cash.  Granted, that was a privately funded, but government
<br>
arranged bailout, but it reinforced the same overly risky investment
<br>
mentality that permeated the 1980s and 1990s.)
<br>
<p>Anothe song, which all should be aware of, is life is full of failures
<br>
as well as successes.  This is especially true in business and the stock
<br>
market.  Everyone can't be right at the same time in stocks (or
<br>
commodities or futures), especially if each investor is betting that she
<br>
or he is right and everyone else is wrong.  That's why it might be a
<br>
good idea not to stick your nest egg in your company's stock options or
<br>
even your company's 401(k).  Diversify and be vigilant!  After all, it's
<br>
your future you're playing with.
<br>
<p>Enjoy!
<br>
