<em>&gt; &gt; The only fair solution I've seen was a fully integrated unit as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; portrayed in &quot;Starship Troopers.&quot; &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was the book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that convinced me to join the USMC and I was delighted to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's now on the boot camp recommended reading list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yup, read it twice.  However, it's been quite a while since my last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reading, before the movie came out.  My recollection (admittedly flawed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occasion) is the book didn't deal with sexual integration at all.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shower scenes that I can remember.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;integrated showers was a Paul Verhoeven creation.
</em><br>
<p>You're right.  Out of all the members of the mobile infantry, we don't see 
<br>
a single femaleand in fact, in &quot;A Tunnel in the Sky&quot; the main character's 
<br>
sister was a member of &quot;The Amazon Corps&quot; or something like that, so he 
<br>
probably wasn't a supporter of integrated combat units.  The &quot;starship 
<br>
troopers&quot; book and movie really had very little to do with each other, 
<br>
except for the character names.
