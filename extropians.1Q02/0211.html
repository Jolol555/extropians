<p>That depends on who you ask, of course.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose income taxes were eliminated altogether and replaced with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marginally higher tax on capital gains (not more than 30%).  The
</em><br>
government
<br>
<em>&gt; would have to tighten its belt for a few years, but the net effect may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually be what the progressive income tax claims to be and isn't.
</em><br>
There
<br>
<em>&gt; are a number of apparent consequences to this.  Overall, this looks
</em><br>
like a
<br>
<em>&gt; more promising way of bootstrapping people from low affluence to
</em><br>
moderately
<br>
<em>&gt; high levels of affluence.
</em><br>
<p>Aside from the fact that capital gains are already above that -- I
<br>
believe they are 36% -- this would represent a tax on investment.  An
<br>
income tax impacts both investment and consumption, but generally, if
<br>
you want an economy to grow, you'd prefer consumption to be taxed over
<br>
investment.  (Of course, ultimately, all investment is consumption -- in
<br>
the sense that people save and invest today so they can consume in the
<br>
future.)  As Mike Linksvayer points out, this would punish investment at
<br>
the sake of consumption.
<br>
<p>Also, regarding Georgism, I believe the basic belief is that land -- and
<br>
presumably all natural resources -- are owned by society, so the tax on
<br>
them is, for Georgists, not a tax in the sense of the government taking
<br>
your stuff for whatever reason.  Instead, it's more like a rental fee
<br>
for your use of the resource that's not owned by you.  (I'm not sure how
<br>
accurate this is and discussions of Georgism seem mostly utopian to me.)
<br>
<p>I still advocate getting rid of taxes completely.  The problem with
<br>
advocating some sort of interim tax system for now is that this not only
<br>
distracts from abolishing taxation, but it often leads to hybrid
<br>
systems.  In this case, by the time James Rogers's idea got through the
<br>
Congress or any Parliament, it would most likely just increase capital
<br>
gains taxes and maybe reduce some income taxes.  It would probably not
<br>
fundamentally change the system.  (This is very important, since the
<br>
system being much intact or even just a little diminished would just
<br>
continue to grow.)  Add to this, the effort used up in lobbying,
<br>
campaigning, advertizing the plan would be unrecoverable.  Maybe taxes
<br>
might be a little lower, maybe not.
<br>
<p>We see this with the idea of a national sales tax in America.  The idea
<br>
pops up now and again and many libertarians are pulled into the reform
<br>
movement only to see the reform fail.  (Which might be good because I
<br>
fear what will happen is we'll get both the national sales tax and keep
<br>
the income tax.)  Such has happened to with many efforts to simplify the
<br>
tax code in the US.  (Not that simplification is always good.  The
<br>
loopholes allow at least some room for people to keep their wealth.  The
<br>
thing to do should be to expand them.)
<br>
<p>Also, anything that raises government revenues is also, IMO, suspect,
<br>
since this will only make for more government -- unless there's are
<br>
strict and strictly enforced limits on spending, such as laws where any
<br>
surplus must be refunded.  (I fear even strict limits will be kept only
<br>
so long as they are politically fashionable.  As soon as an emergency
<br>
arises, I fear the government would seek to get around them.  It might
<br>
not at the first emergency, but it will eventually.)  Not taking, too,
<br>
IMHO, is better than refunding, especially since there's less of a
<br>
chance of someone getting a refund they don't deserve.  (E.g., should
<br>
people on the public dole in the US, e.g., get a tax refund for their
<br>
mortgages?  After all, they really aren't paying the mortgage with their
<br>
money.  They're paying it with money they got from the government which
<br>
got it from real taxpayers.  In other words, they are net tax
<br>
consumers.)
<br>
<p>Back into lurk mode!
