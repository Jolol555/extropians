<em>&gt; This idea seems great at first, but there are two downsides: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  It wouldn't cut costs.  The energy needed to go half-way to mars and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the rest of the way will be at least equal to the whole trip.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra fuel needed to precicely dock with the cycler station will probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make such a trip MORE expensive than a straight shot.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about the latter claim.  After all, if the cycler station was 
<br>
more like a storage depot, each individual trip to it might use a lot less 
<br>
fuel than a straight shot to Mars.  Why?  The mass would be smaller for the 
<br>
ship docking to the cycler station. 
<br>
<p>The idea is, I think, to use the cycle more as a cheap way to ferry supplies 
<br>
and maybe people back and forth.  One can make several small trips to a 
<br>
cycler station -- rather than one big one to the station or the destination. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2)  At a distance half-way to mars, the cycler would have an orbit of 517.6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days.  Doesn't sound bad.  But, as a result, it would line up with earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only every 3.4 years, and with mars only every 2.1 years.  Assuming the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average (half) wait for any arbitrary launch time, a trip to mars via the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycler would take 2.7 years.  Since mars aligns with earth every 2.1 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cycler would slow down such trips.  And as I pointed out, without saving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any money.
</em><br>
<p>That could be a problem...  Is there only one cycler configuration?  Also, 
<br>
for people that's a long time, but for a lot of cargo, it doesn't matter.  
<br>
Imagine, e.g., a cycler supplying a Mars base.  The only point would be to 
<br>
ferry bulk supplies continuously to Mars. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason such stations have been proposed in the past is not to save money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or energy, but to allow inadequate ships to get to mars.  Assume a ship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot carry enough food.  The advantage of a cycler would be that several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unmanned ships could be sent to rendevous with the cycler.  Then when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manned ship goes, there will be an oasis with food along the journey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the reason to consider cyclers.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good idea too and melds with that of using a cycler station as a 
<br>
supply ferry.  A manned mission to Mars could arrive there with large 
<br>
quantities of &quot;cycled&quot; supplies already in place.  This might cut down on 
<br>
the need for fancy technology or even recycling and repairs.  After all, if 
<br>
you can cycle through enough spare parts... 
<br>
<p>I think the idea is good for another reason.  It lends itself to a variety 
<br>
of uses.  A direct Mars mission would only be useful for that and probably 
<br>
only to get there and maybe back.  A cycler station could be used over and 
<br>
over and even, I bet, &quot;recycled&quot; to other uses, since it would be a bona 
<br>
fide space station or supply ferry. 
<br>
<p>Also, with such a system in place, you don't need to develop larger ships to 
<br>
make the journey.  The manned ship could just have enough to get to Mars 
<br>
&quot;high speed&quot; and not have to carry much else beyond the supplies to get 
<br>
there -- and maybe to get back, in case of an emergency -- but not the 
<br>
supplies needed for a long stay on Mars. 
<br>
<p>Cheers!
