<p>I'd question the use of the term &quot;all&quot;. I think the rotation curves
<br>
have been measured for a number of galaxies.  Its probably more than
<br>
50, but I doubt its more than a few thousand.  I also don't know
<br>
how &quot;wide&quot; the rotational velocity distribution is.  If its
<br>
moderately wide that could be signs of galaxies in various
<br>
stages of going dark.  If its narrow, that seems to suggest
<br>
some universal form of dark matter clustering with the visible
<br>
matter.
<br>
<p>If it went dark a long time ago we probably don't see it as a galaxy.
<br>
What's the difference between a &quot;dwarf galaxy&quot; and a non-dwarf one that
<br>
has mostly dark stars?  The entire field of study of &quot;diffuse&quot; galaxies
<br>
has only opened up recently because if its nearby, you need to study
<br>
a fairly large patch of sky and if its distant you need a really
<br>
big telescope to identify individual stars and classify them as
<br>
being gravitationally bound to one another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This might be old stuff to Robert, but has anyone run off a detailed range
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of possibilities for how such a history might affect the observable cosmos?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so -- everyone is pretty much trying to prove the
<br>
standard model.  The only real competitor is the steady state
<br>
approach (which I think is Hoyle et al.).
<br>
<p>If you want to check you could poke around in the ADS search
<br>
engine looking for reviews.  Unfortunately Astronomers don't
<br>
seem to do as much &quot;review&quot; production as medical types seem
<br>
to, so its difficult for a non-astronomer to get a handle on it.
<br>
I think there is an &quot;Annual Review of Astronomy&quot; however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming that life couldn't emerge until, say, five billion years ago, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets statistically more likely with each gigayear since (and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proximity to YOU ARE HERE &lt;= ), can we chart corrections to luminosity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors taken for granted by astronomers who assume an unengineered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe?
</em><br>
<p>Of course specific galactic history is going to vary by whether one
<br>
has collided with other galaxies -- that stirs up the pot (probably
<br>
for the worse).  IMO, almost everyone is looking at the universe like
<br>
the glass is full (unengineered).  There hasn't been much thought
<br>
devoted to the glass being &quot;half-full&quot; (half-engineered).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If closer galaxies are stochastically dimmer or red-downshifted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mustn't this do something interesting to the canonical calculated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recession rate and hence projected closure vs. openness?
</em><br>
<p>The only thing I've seen is the recent paper (perhaps from Amara)
<br>
discussing how Axions could explain the apparent acceleration of
<br>
the expansion of the Universe by precisely such a &quot;dimming&quot; effect
<br>
(as photons oscillate into Axions).
<br>
<p>We may also want to be wary of over simplification.  There may
<br>
be two different explanations for dark matter.  Galactic halos
<br>
may be ATC while dark matter effects in galactic clusters may
<br>
be intergalactic hydrogen.  Think about how long it has taken
<br>
to resolve the GRB observations into sub-classes such as colliding
<br>
neutron stars and hypernovae.  But everyone started out looking
<br>
for a one-size fits all explanation.
