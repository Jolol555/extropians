<em>&gt; So the US is no longer a free or capitalistic country since we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now have thousands of selectively enforced federal &quot;crimes&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dozens of excuses for forfeiture (forfeiture without due process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you have to prove they should give your property back).
</em><br>
<p>The forfeiture you speak of is specifically in the case where a person
<br>
has been convicted of a drug trafficking offense, where after criminal
<br>
conviction, their property is seized by the government in civil court
<br>
proceedings, on the basis that the property was purchased, in part or in
<br>
whole, by the proceeds of drug money, leaving the owner to prove that
<br>
they didn't use drug money to obtain the property. While this is not
<br>
hard to do if one has used banks to process one's income and payments
<br>
for the property, when it comes to cash transactions, this is very
<br>
difficult to prove. 
<br>
<p>I've known a few people who lost their property from such actions, and
<br>
frankly, I can say that in every case it helped them accelerate their
<br>
drug addiction trajectory so that they hit rock bottom and got help a
<br>
lot sooner than they would have if they had that property to depend upon
<br>
to maintain their lifestyle and drug habit.
<br>
<p>While I am steadfastly opposed to the drug war, and support
<br>
legalized/medicalized drug use, I am also distinctly aware, through
<br>
extensive personal experience, that an individual addicted to drugs is
<br>
not a sane, mature, consenting citizen in control of themselves (no
<br>
matter whether the drug is alcohol, pot, coke, etc, even tobacco). I
<br>
have seen previously high functioning, rational people descend into the
<br>
most ludicrous, insanely infantile behavior due to their addictions that
<br>
they are unable or unwilling to control.
<br>
<p>In this respect, civil forfeiture functions (admittedly poorly) as a
<br>
means of treating those who act like children as children. I do not deny
<br>
that it could be improved, in the form of making such seizures
<br>
temporary, until the individual has gone through rehab and recovery,
<br>
rather than just a get rich quick scheme for policemen and police
<br>
departments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also there is almost no financial privacy whatsoever.
</em><br>
<p>But should there be financial privacy? It's difficult to enforce private
<br>
property rights unless there is some record of what exactly is owned by
<br>
whome. While this doesn't necessarily mean it should ALL be publicly
<br>
available to all, it does mean that when you've sold something to
<br>
someone, you have as much a right to the fact that you sold it as the
<br>
buyer does. If the buyer doesn't specifically require you to keep the
<br>
transaction private, and you have no publicly announced privacy policy,
<br>
you have a right to sell the information about the sale.
<br>
<p>Who sells your financial info? Credit agencies obtain it from financial
<br>
institutions and businesses who have extended you credit, either in the
<br>
form of a credit card, or in the form of accepting anything but cash for
<br>
payment. When you violate that credit, they have a right to report that
<br>
fact. If you don't want bad stuff on your credit record, don't do things
<br>
that will get on there.
<br>
<p>As Suze Ormon says, &quot;respect attracts money, disrespect repels it&quot;. If
<br>
you demonstrate your disrespect for money, yours or other peoples, you
<br>
will repel money, in the form of loans, investment, or credit to you for
<br>
transactions and enterprises you wish to undertake. It is, after all,
<br>
other people's money, and they have a right to know how respectful you
<br>
will be of it from your past record.
