From: &quot;Ken Clements&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Ken@Innovation-On-Demand.com?Subject=Re:%20Jaron%20Lanier%20Got%20Up%20My%20Shnoz%20on%20AI">Ken@Innovation-On-Demand.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; you do point out the basic undesirability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiring human workers who waste all those neuro cycles by thinking on the
</em><br>
job.
<br>
<p>...and not only thinking, but plotting and scheming and dreaming on the job.
<br>
Present levels of robotically controlled manufacturing, process monitoring,
<br>
and system administrating signifies that just about all industrial and
<br>
management jobs can be performed more cost effectively by autonomous machines.
<br>
Although we're still a long way from all-purpose-entirely-robotic-systems
<br>
(APE-RS), the immense wealth to be acquired with such machines continues to
<br>
motivate competition and basic research in this phase-transitional technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another problem with claims to immortality is the death through change
</em><br>
property.
<br>
<em>&gt; I have a step-son who is a teenager now, but I well remember playing with
</em><br>
him when
<br>
<em>&gt; he was three years old.  Although he is still alive, that three year old is
</em><br>
gone.
<br>
<em>&gt; I cannot play with him, and I cannot take his picture.  We do not call it
</em><br>
death,
<br>
<em>&gt; but I have empirical data that that three year old was not immortal.  If
</em><br>
something
<br>
<em>&gt; exists in a few hundred years that comes from who and what I am now, it will
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; be like I am now.  In that way I am no more immortal than was my three year
</em><br>
old,
<br>
<em>&gt; all of technology notwithstanding.
</em><br>
<p>That's partly why I think of cryonics as a neo-Luddite technology that seeks
<br>
to preserve (freeze) unenlightened biological entities instead of evolving to
<br>
higher capabilities. Once we understand the threshold level of computational
<br>
complexity that catalyzes hyper-cognitive enlightenment, the notion of
<br>
individual uniqueness disappears along with the notions of vitalism and
<br>
phlogiston. Unless humans reach hyper-cognitive sentience, they have failed to
<br>
attain their full potential. Once we attain total awareness, we understand
<br>
that this direct experience of reality is not specific to a particular brain
<br>
(whether carbon-based or otherwise).
<br>
Anyway, this is all inconsequential in the face of a global war (inspired by
<br>
religious fanaticism) that can destroy all life on Earth.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>We truly understand reality in proportion as the scientific method accurately
<br>
identifies incorrect thinking.

<em>&gt; This begs the question of &quot;what is creativity&quot; -- is there money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in creating machines that are as creative as humans?  Would that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require creating artificially sentient machines?  Wouldn't there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be money in that, then?
</em><br>
<p>Creativity alone is not enough. Even a deaf, dumb, and insensitive system can
<br>
create. Nature creates geniuses, but it also creates morons and monsters.
<br>
Creativity combined with selectivity makes products worth money. Creativity
<br>
does not require sentience, as computer-generated poetry/humor demonstrates.
<br>
Artificial sentience has no monetary value for the same reasons that human
<br>
sentience has no monetary value. (It's priceless -- just like cat snot.) We
<br>
may appreciate and enjoy life, but our sentience has no market value. Money
<br>
may buy happiness, but sentience has no economic value. No one is going to pay
<br>
us to be hyper-cognitive, sitting quietly in totally aware contemplation. So,
<br>
sentience is the ultimate product for end users. Furthermore, we can attain
<br>
superlative sentience, while our creative ability may remain undeveloped.
<br>
Buddhas are not artists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there such a notion as a &quot;naturally sentient machine&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah -- a human being. Duh!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you consider a machine/robot that hosts an uploaded human?
</em><br>
<p>Mom?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The sentience would be the human's, wouldn't it?  Or would it ...
</em><br>
<p>Sentience that is uncontaminated by any particular set and setting, i.e., pure
<br>
awareness, is just that -- pure awareness... or we could call it pure
<br>
sentience. I like to call it superlative sentience, because it's the ultimate
<br>
interface of reality recognizing itself. Superlative sentience is like going
<br>
back where you began, and seeing it as if for the first time... only without
<br>
the &quot;you.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>As the scientific method accurately identifies incorrect thinking, inevitably
<br>
it displaces thought itself.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Dossy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dossy@panoptic.com?Subject=Re:%20Jaron%20Lanier%20Got%20Up%20My%20Shnoz%20on%20AI">dossy@panoptic.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Thus, freeing up humans, who do enjoy abilities such as thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and contemplating, to do more thinking and contemplating.
</em><br>
<p>That reminds me of a story:
<br>
The Jug Sage of Delhi was an enlightened beggar whose only possessions were a
<br>
blanket and a jug. During the day, he would sit by the side of the road with
<br>
his jug. Passers-by could put whatever they wanted into the jug (or take
<br>
whatever they wanted out of the jug, since the Jug Sage would not prevent
<br>
them). The Jug Sage sat in quiet contemplation (with the occasional giggle)
<br>
all day long, and was supported by the rest of the population, who gave him
<br>
food and water. People treated the Jug Sage like a stray cat or a squirrel in
<br>
the park.
<br>
Of course this scenario would not play in most American cities, because the
<br>
robots (whoops! excuse me, I mean the citizens) have passed laws against
<br>
begging and vagrancy.
<br>
Anyway, the point of bringing up this story is to show that certain people
<br>
would readily accept lives of idyllic idleness (ignoring the uncomfortable
<br>
stigma of homeless vagrancy), and let robots take care of their physical
<br>
needs. Those who have learned the knack of meditation see this as the ultimate
<br>
way of life.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>As the scientific method accurately identifies incorrect thinking, it
<br>
inevitably identifies all thinking as incorrect. At that point, science means
<br>
the same as superlative sentience.
