<em>&gt;From: &quot;steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:steve365@btinternet.com?Subject=Re:%20Bye-Bye%20to%20the%20&gt;H%20Right%20Wing">steve365@btinternet.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I have much more sympathy for this than I did a few years ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(although I am still uneasy about the sub-Kantian idea that your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;higher self&quot; is disabled by the habit), particularly in the light
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the research Brian (I think it was) mentioned about the sector
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of any population which has a genetic sensitivity to specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substances. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I was the one who mentioned this work. The figure (for
<br>
alcohol) is 10% of the general population of the United States.
<br>
Specific cultural groups have much higher percentages, older
<br>
cultures like the middle east (alcohol is a muslim word) have lower
<br>
percentages and modern world cultures (native Americans for
<br>
example) have much higher.
<br>
<p>I would expect other addictive substances to have similar numbers.
<br>
<p>Evolution at work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So simply saying &quot;everyone do what they want and let the chips
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fall where they may&quot; shouldn't be an option. The hard question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what is the best thing to do? As you say civil forfeiture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other aspects of the drug war are not helping (and make things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worse in many ways). They are also creating desperately dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precedents and incentives for law enforcers. Perhaps we can learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the way alcohol abuse was reduced in Britain, from being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;widespread, very severe problem in the 1840s and earlier to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a relatively minor problem by the 1890s, through things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education, social pressure, regulation and the use of fiscal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policy.  I think you have to accept you can't get rid of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem entirely, it's a matter of getting it to an &quot;acceptable&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level. The key calculation must be a cost/benefit analysis where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you trade off the costs of drug use (the externalities you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describe) against the costs of prohibition (such as loss of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberty, corruption of the criminal justice system, growth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organised crime). Steve Davies
</em><br>
<p>Excellent points, and education and real knowledge rather than
<br>
folklore is the key.
<br>
<p>Alcohol is an addictive substance that affects different people
<br>
differently. If you were fortunate (pre-GATTACA) enough to be born
<br>
with the right biochemistry you couldn't get addicted if you tried,
<br>
if you were unfortunate you could become addicted almost
<br>
immediately.
<br>
<p>Most people lie somewhere in between. Strangely it is those who
<br>
alcohol seems to affect the least who are actually those at
<br>
greatest risk. Many people drink for decades before becoming
<br>
addicted.
<br>
<p>Until a cure is developed,(good extropian project) education and
<br>
acceptance as to the indicators and causes of alcohol addiction is
<br>
the best method for successful treatment.
<br>
<p>All evidence indicates that once addicted, lifelong abstinence is
<br>
the only currently effective treatment.
