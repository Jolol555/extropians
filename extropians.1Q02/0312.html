A response on the BMJ site provides the most interesting *pro* case:
<br>
<p>Stephan A. Schwartz, 
<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;Email Stephan A. Schwartz: 
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="mailto:saschwartz@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Magic%20Medicine,%20more">saschwartz@earthlink.net</a>  
<br>
<p>Those correspondents who suggested that the controls should be included in
<br>
a cross-over study where they become the treated sub-population in a
<br>
subsequent study have, I believe, misunderstood what is going on. This
<br>
study is not about reaching back from the future into the past to change it
<br>
but, instead, affecting the way in which it occurred in the first instance,
<br>
when these clinical events were present tense. 
<br>
&nbsp;Nor is this study a singular piece of benighted research, as others seem
<br>
to suggest. BMJ readers may find the following URL of interest, 
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/</a> 
<br>
&nbsp;There they will find a number of papers addressing various aspects of this
<br>
subject, and I particularly draw their attention to the work of physicist
<br>
Helmut Schmidt. 
<br>
&nbsp;Readers may also want to consider a just published study carried out by
<br>
researchers at Duke University's School of Medicine, which also deals with
<br>
retroactive Therapeutic Intent (TI). (1) (TI is, I think, a better term
<br>
than prayer, because the now considerable literature on this subject
<br>
suggests that any form of religious belief, or none at all, seems capable
<br>
of achieving the effect.) 
<br>
&nbsp;Using a well-designed randomized, controlled, double-blind protocol, the
<br>
Duke study involves prayers from religious groups around the world for
<br>
people experiencing severe chest pains who are in danger of imminent heart
<br>
attacks. The treatment they received to relief their crisis was cardiac
<br>
catheterization and angioplasty. As readers will know, the emergency nature
<br>
of these treatments means the procedures are carried out immediately upon
<br>
the patient being admitted. That turns out to be the crucial aspect of the
<br>
retro-active aspect of this TI research, because although the prayer groups
<br>
were notified as soon as possible after the patient was admitted, the
<br>
initiation of the actual TI sessions often began after the medical
<br>
treatment had already been completed. Both treated and control groups
<br>
received the same level of medical intervention. 
<br>
&nbsp;The TI practitioners had no contact with the patients, and the health
<br>
professionals administering the treatments, and the patients themselves did
<br>
not know about the TI involvement. The outcome measure was the number of
<br>
complications each patient experienced, with the comparison being made
<br>
between the subgroups. The TI recipients experienced, a 50 to 100 percent
<br>
reduction in side-effects compared to the controls. 
<br>
&nbsp;Although this was just a pilot study with a patient population too small
<br>
to reach any definitive conclusions, the results have proven so provocative
<br>
that researchers at more than half a dozen medical centers in the U.S. have
<br>
taken up this line of inquiry. 
<br>
&nbsp;The study had another aspect that should be mentioned. The TI
<br>
practitioners were scattered all over the world, including Nepal, India,
<br>
Israel, and France, as well as in the U.S., and their TI was expressed
<br>
through a wide range of religious traditions. No difference was noted
<br>
concerning one tradition being more powerful or efficacious than any other. 
<br>
&nbsp;Skeptics may find this line of inquiry philosophically offensive but the
<br>
gathering corpus of research suggests that TI, whether retroactive or
<br>
real-time has the power to affect clinical outcome.

<br>
<p>Stephan elaborated this to me, in quantum theory terms; I commented in reply:
<br>
<p>&lt; I understand this general argument, but I think in this case it fatally
<br>
fudges what a state vector collapse is. `Once someone has been in a
<br>
retroactive experiment the vector is collapsed.' Oh? What gives the future
<br>
or delayed `observation' priority over all the other observations
<br>
(decoherences) that are constantly been made by everything
<br>
surrounding/interacting with the patient in real time, including the
<br>
doctors and nurses, the sheets, the air, and the bacteria or viruses at
<br>
work inside his or her suffering body? &gt;
