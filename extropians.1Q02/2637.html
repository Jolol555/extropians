<p><em>&gt; I don't know the answer, but I assume most traffic lights are

</em><br>
<p>Perhaps they are affecting things at a higher level... maybe the influence
<br>
comes earlier in a temporal sense, and just subtly alters the world so that,
<br>
at the point in time when the Magick practitioner sails through the lights,
<br>
they just happen to all be green. Also, maybe it only works for serious, not
<br>
very numerous magickal type people, thus not causing a fairness problem.
<br>
<p>Chesh, if you want to try to accumulate a bit of proof, try logging the
<br>
exact amount of greens vs reds, maybe with a measurement of how long you
<br>
wait at the red. Get some non-magickal friends in the same area who use
<br>
similar routes to do the same. Compare notes. You could even try turning
<br>
them red vs turning them green to see if you can get a measurable
<br>
difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But of course a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *huge* proportion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pedestrians act is if they believe traffic lights can be coerced or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propitiated by hitting the button repeatedly. That might not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be magical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking, though, just displaced frustration. I found a woman 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at a busy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intersection the other day hammering repeatedly at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; button, and asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her politely why she was doing it. `Because I'm frustrated,' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she said with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a grin. `Yes, but you don't actually think that it affects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the--?' `No, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it makes me feel better.' `Okay.' It also wears out the mechanism more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly, I suppose. But I suspect that she was smarter than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many people; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really think that many people believe that if you slam the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; button ten or 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times the lights will change more quickly.
</em><br>
<p>A related thought... I use a lift (elevator) every day to get to work. On
<br>
almost every trip there are multiple people in the lift, and, after everyone
<br>
has entered but before the doors close, almost without fail, someone will
<br>
press the &quot;doors close&quot; button. The thing I notice about this is that there
<br>
is no observable difference in how long it takes for the doors to close
<br>
(although I've never timed it; I should try that), if people press that
<br>
button or not. I even have a vague feeling that I've heard of lifts with
<br>
&quot;doors close&quot; buttons which are fake.
<br>
<p>Internal locus of control... it's a bitch, ey?
