<p>This is something I have wondered myself. Living in the UK  we are subject to 
<br>
much tighter gun control laws. However I resently had indepth corespondence 
<br>
with my local Constablary, which is equivelent to a centralised state police 
<br>
centre (not sure if such a thing exists in the US). I was enquiring about the 
<br>
laws regarding production of  Paintball guns.   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those of you who have never played paintball, the guns used can 
<br>
hold in excess of 140 rounds and fire them at a rate of 20 rounds per second 
<br>
!. And be reloaded in less than 1 second. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the UK a paintball gun is only subject to 2 regulations. 
<br>
1. It must be semi automatic e.g fire ONE shot per trigger pull
<br>
2. Must not exceed the 12 FT/lb law e.g the energy of the projective must not 
<br>
exceed 12ft/lbs
<br>
<p>But as the licencing officer told me &quot;Paintball guns are considered TOYS&quot; and 
<br>
as such they needed no license to own and therefor, no license to manufacture.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lead me to wonder. As the 12 ft//lb law is subject to a simple 
<br>
mathmatical eqution (weight * mass=energy). It stands to reason that a weapon 
<br>
that delivers a projectile of extremely low mass at extremely high velocity 
<br>
could easily come within this restriction and be an unlicensed or 
<br>
unlicensable  weapon. Dispite being cabable of killing/maiming, causing 
<br>
extreame bodily harm.
<br>
<p>This is just a reference to the inadequate laws regarding Gun control in the 
<br>
UK. Obviously the UK's laws are far more extreme than in the U.S.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in answer to your question regarding Laser and E.M.P weapons. As 
<br>
far as the UK is concerned, I have not found a single peice of legislation 
<br>
that would stop you building such a weapon, even if it were of sufficient 
<br>
size to cause considerable damage or death.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK laws genarally seem to be &quot;If something bad happens, we will do 
<br>
something about it&quot; if not, then do what you want as long as it doesn't cause 
<br>
me paperwork !.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the guy who invented, developed and tried to build the 
<br>
Super Gun was British. Im sure tha under UK law he could have built it in his 
<br>
back yard and got away with it. That may sound ridiculous, but under UK law 
<br>
it is perfectly legal to own, Use and drive an operational &quot;TANK&quot; in ANY part 
<br>
of the British isles without a license, But you must have a license to own a 
<br>
Dog.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go figure !.
<br>
<p>Alex
<br>
<p>p.s ok so you dont need a dog license any more since 1985. But you still DONT 
<br>
NEED A LICENSE FOR A TANK !
