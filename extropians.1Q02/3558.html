<p><em>&gt; My idea, in case there are any programmers

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the future from Type I to Type II onto Type III galactic civilizations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your map starts out as, say, a 1km x 1km grid, a town or village.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control individual units, they are all to scale and 3D models.  But, as
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes. This is exactly what I have been thinking of. It requires a
<br>
somewhat trustworthy AI to run your units, but could really get away
<br>
from the problem in SMAC that when you have a planet-spanning empire,
<br>
you are still micromanaging formers planting forest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The flow of time would not be linear as well, as you progress further, time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passes more rapidly (just as kurzweil speaks of the diminishing time between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salient events) At the basic level, time passes 1 sec for every second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; played, then moves to a 10:1, 100:1, etc. etc.  
</em><br>
<p>This is good, but it also introduces a limitation in multiplayer games.
<br>
Everybody needs to run at roughly the same speed, otherwise things will
<br>
not work. If player A is running at 100:1 and player B at 1:1, then we
<br>
have problems. For a single player game this is no problem. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The main measurement in the game will be energy, how much energy is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society producing how much can it control / harness (for transporation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, etc)
</em><br>
<p>I would use energy, information and control over matter as main
<br>
measurements. Information deals with how much information can be stored,
<br>
transmitted and controlled, matter control deals with the scale of
<br>
control (macrotech, microtech, nanotech, femtotech, plancktech...). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would like to model algorithms that make up the names for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological breakthroughs, so they will not be limited or predifined, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different civiliazations may have different means of accomplishing these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things (different size devices, different levels of effeciency, etc)
</em><br>
<p>And advances should not always have predictable or wholly good effects -
<br>
inventing AI should open a huge can of worms, as would methods of
<br>
motivation control.
