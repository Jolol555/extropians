To me, this whole compulsion of biological heredity is

irrational. Why are we investing so much energy trying

&nbsp;not spend more time improving the quality of life for the

something here - perhaps its because I'm much too young

&nbsp;&amp; I don't have children, but I just don't understand. I'm

probably way off the mark with this one so I'm already

<p>Vanessa,
<br>
&nbsp;Don't apologize for being young. It means
<br>
your chances of being immortal are better (barring
<br>
age-related accidents!).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many rational reasons to have biological 
<br>
children rather than adopt.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I question your implicit assumption... all people are 
<br>
not created equal!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence and mental characteristics
<br>
are substantially heritable. How do you get a prospective
<br>
adoptee's pedigree? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is that health,intelligence, and emotional temperment
<br>
are strongly affected by the prenatal environment and the
<br>
environment immediately following birth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, adopt and you never know what you got.
<br>
This can happen with one's own biological kids yes,
<br>
but you can be aware of some things and ameliate some
<br>
others through proper health care etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This all beyond the simple fact that I wouldn't have any 
<br>
interest in raising someone else's kids. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't imagine the &quot;grandparents&quot; would be especially
<br>
thrilled either!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption is good for those who cannot reproduce biologically
<br>
but why do it if there is an alternative, for anything like a
<br>
bearable expense?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine many exceptions to this principle, but the basic
<br>
principle is still valid.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption is not superior ethically or morally to biological 
<br>
parenting... and it is &lt;certainly&gt; less efficient in producing
<br>
children who are of the highest possible caliber.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask folks who adopted Rumanian orphans who were
<br>
largely deprived of human contact in infancy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The psychological ramifications of an adopted child
<br>
are potentially staggering, depending on the adoptees
<br>
genes and pre-adoptive environment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I quail at the thought of attempting it. But feel free,
<br>
it's your genetic funeral!
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
Brian
