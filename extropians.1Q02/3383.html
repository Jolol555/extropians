</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No; writing was invented long before - around 4100-3800 BCE. The

<em>&gt; You are right -- I shouldn't have said &quot;birth&quot; of writing. I know writing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been around longer than the world's big current religions. The others 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had their religions too... they just died out when their civilisations

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the awe they had for the written word -- The Book -- when the technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was ooh aah new. It may be the shift from oral to written recording that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be crucial -- when writing is new for each people.
</em><br>
<p><p>I would personally think your first intuition was right. If you take a
<br>
larger view, seeing the monotheism as a product of writing makes
<br>
sense. While writing was invented &quot;around 4100-3800 BCE&quot; (Anders), one
<br>
may hypothesize that pre-monotheist creeds have existed for tens of
<br>
tousands years or more before. (see below for some supporting arguments)
<br>
<p>So OK, writing didn't instantly produce monotheism, but maybe it
<br>
started/boosted a cultural process which in turn begat monotheism (and
<br>
Plato), which begat atheism (and materialism) -- which will beget the
<br>
Singularity (maybe!).
<br>
<p>I see it as a fairly linear world view development (no offence
<br>
intended to religious people), in which writing is just instrumental.
<br>
(Not &quot;linear&quot; as opposed to exponentional of course.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The first big monotheist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;religion was Zoroastrism, which emerged around ~1400 BCE. Judaism maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;emerged from around 2000 BCE onwards, hinduism evolved around 1500 BCE,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;buddhism around 600 BCE. Christianity emerged around 100 CE, and islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;around 600 CE. Overall, the emergence of new religions appear rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;evenly spaced. However, the ideas that are incorporated may have emerged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;elsewhere and in far older times.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with Anders that they MAY have, and that my linearization
<br>
above may seem arbitrary (not to mention ethocentric and all that). As
<br>
we don't have prehistorical documents, somehow anything MAY have been
<br>
part of prehistorical culture.
<br>
<p>However, I think we can find some arguments to support my and Miriam's
<br>
intuition.
<br>
<p>Plato's ideas (whether he invented them or rather crystalized them)
<br>
for example were a great support for the development of Christianity.
<br>
Can you imagine Plato without writing? In fact can you imagine
<br>
philosophizing (for best and worse) without writing?
<br>
<p>But forget Plato. A certain level of abstraction, and of persistence
<br>
of thinking inside abstract domains, requires writing. And I think
<br>
such practical capacity of abstraction may well naturally shape
<br>
surnatural beliefs into monotheism, while the absence of such capacity
<br>
brings you back to the real world and its diversity, etc.
<br>
<p>Another, negative argument I can think of is that writing boosts
<br>
knowledge of the natural world, and that this knowledge in turn favors
<br>
believing in one unknowable God (like in islam, which is in fact, as
<br>
you may note, the most recent), rather than seeing godlets and magic
<br>
all over the place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I would really like to know what happend 500-400 BCE - look at the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of extremely influential philosophers suddenly popping up worldwide; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;important greek ones in the West, Sun Tzu, Confucius, Buddha etc. Why so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;many at this time?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe just because of some maturation stage consequent to the start of
<br>
writing?
<br>
<p>I'm sure many of you made this experience: you put some transhumanist
<br>
seed into a friend's mind, and your friend's mind computes and ends up
<br>
asking questions or making suggestions of its own that you could
<br>
somehow expect.
<br>
<p>It's like a place you go into, and when people explore it, they
<br>
naturally stumble on the same things.
<br>
<p>Exploring the logical space of world view is like that, too. When you
<br>
get to a certain point, you are bound to ask the questions Plato
<br>
asked, etc., just like a child at a certain point of his development
<br>
(but not before) asks where children come from.
<br>
<p>So it may be that Plato, though an &quot;extremely influential&quot; (Anders)
<br>
thinker, is not quite as influential as one may think, but more like
<br>
the web protocol. (Are you sure? -- Yes. -- All right.) What I mean
<br>
is, thinking that HTTP+HTML invention was something extremely
<br>
influential that begat all the web activity we see now is probably an
<br>
error. The web is more of an invention that had to happen at that time
<br>
so that the development rate of the Internet could be maintained.
<br>
There is an internal logic in this development, an unfolding of
<br>
possibilities that are good, and begets the necessary &quot;inventions&quot; to
<br>
support it. (Think about Moore's law, too.)
<br>
<p>The logical space of worldview is not linear, but it has lots of
<br>
dead-ends and places you simply cannot go rationnally (some lunatic
<br>
may go there, but his thoughts will get lost). And it has one region
<br>
which corresponds to the truth, or at least it has a truth gradient,
<br>
so that we are probably somehow attracted to this place, and given the
<br>
paths available, you don't have so many choices. So it ends up being
<br>
quite a linear path that unfolds with time. As you know, even
<br>
Dalai-Lama believes in the possibility of upload. :-)
