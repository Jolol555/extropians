</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I have yet to see someone explain to me how the human need to breathe, eat, 
<br>
sleep, and excrete and reproduce translates into a &quot;right&quot; which is somehow 
<br>
a physical law.  This is nothing but hand-waving.
<br>
<p>&quot;Codified physical law&quot; is hand-waving.  There is the physical universe 
<br>
which includes biology and evolution.  There are human concepts of 
<br>
same.  The map is not the territory.  A human concept is not a physical law 
<br>
(in fact, &quot;physical law&quot; is a merely a human concept - and there are 
<br>
scientists who are not so sure that there ARE &quot;physical laws&quot; operative 
<br>
throughout the Universe).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Give the above notion of natural rights the natural rights exist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regardless of whether they are honored by any particular ruler or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mob.  Judging the actions of the rulers or mobs is done relative to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supporting or denying these &quot;natural rights&quot;, these requirements for human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well-being.  This seems much more reasonable than attempting the reverse, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judging the concept of natural rights on the basis of whether this or that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leader or group would honor and uphold them.   Saying they are a social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contract, in my opinion, makes a similar mistake.  It puts the emphasis on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upholding these rights rather than on whether certain &quot;rights&quot; naturally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are required by dint of the nature of human beings.
</em><br>
<p><p>This still begs the question:  why is the concept &quot;rights&quot; needed?  You 
<br>
have basic human physical needs.  Why elevate them to &quot;rights&quot; unless you 
<br>
are trying to score points in a moral debate?  A principle of Objectivist 
<br>
epistemology, I recall, is that concepts should not be multiplied beyond need.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;What your nature requires relative to the actions of others or their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refraining from certain actions for your optimal functioning does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change based on how they do in fact act toward you.  Natural rights 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;therefore are not a matter of social contract.  Social contracts, if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are rational, grow out of these &quot;natural rights&quot; - not the reverse.
</em><br>
<p>Human behavior as individuals and groups is based on human &quot;nature&quot;, i.e., 
<br>
the structure of our bodies and brains and our physical and cultural 
<br>
evolution - and to an enormous degree on our primate evolutionary 
<br>
heritage.  This behavior considered as a whole can be modeled by various 
<br>
sciences and by economic theory a la Von Mises praexology [or is that 
<br>
praxeology - I can never remember the spelling :-} ]  Such an economic 
<br>
analysis leads to the conclusion that coercion on a large scale or as a 
<br>
general principle of behavior is not productive for a group of sentient 
<br>
conceptually processing entities as a whole.  No &quot;natural rights&quot; are 
<br>
needed - it is simply not productive and therefore not conducive to 
<br>
survival and therefore not in the best interests of such entities to engage 
<br>
in coercion as a behavioral principle.
<br>
<p>The reality, however, is that humans as part of their basic nature as 
<br>
biological entities fear death.  This translates into the same basic two 
<br>
reactions as any other animal:  fight or flight.  In humans, with 
<br>
imagination and conceptual processing capability, this is expressed in two 
<br>
ways for each reaction.  Fight:  1)  self-development or controlling one's 
<br>
personal being (examples might be bodybuilders, martial artists, whatever). 
<br>
2) Concern with understanding and controlling external reality (examples 
<br>
might be scientists, technologists, etc.)  Flight Response: 1) Stand up and 
<br>
wave your arms and try to attract the attention of the &quot;gods&quot; who might 
<br>
give you more life if you stand out from the herd (examples:  anyone in the 
<br>
public eye and anyone who tries to establish themselves as morally superior 
<br>
to everyone else, e.g., priests and philosophers and moralists of every 
<br>
stripe); 2) Tear down everyone above you and stamp on everyone below you 
<br>
(examples:  virtually everyone, especially politicians).
<br>
<p>Instead of recognizing the universe has plenty of resources and the way to 
<br>
survive is to use our conceptually processing capability to take advantage 
<br>
of those resources, i.e., fight response, - defy and defeat death by using 
<br>
our mental and physical resources - the vast bulk of the human race (at 
<br>
least 98-99%) engage in flight response, producing a Darwinian competition 
<br>
&quot;war of all against all&quot; which leads to the world you see around you.
<br>
<p>See Alan Harrington's work &quot;The Immortalist&quot; - probably the most important 
<br>
book ever written on the impact of death on human society.
<br>
<p>Without relieving the species' fear of death, there is no way you are going 
<br>
to override that fear and its flight response with talk of &quot;rights&quot;, when 
<br>
those &quot;rights&quot; are merely concepts that will be accepted or rejected based 
<br>
on the individual's fear reactions.
<br>
<p>The only rational argument for non-coercion is based on economic 
<br>
self-interest which in turn is based on the economic interest of the 
<br>
species as a whole.  This argument, however, cannot override genetically 
<br>
inbred fear, either.
<br>
<p>The issue of &quot;rights&quot; is IRRELEVANT to the issue of personal survival which 
<br>
is the only valid human purpose.  Personal survival demands dealing with 
<br>
the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.  One can certainly proceed on 
<br>
the basic of a principle of non-coercion, but trying to convince any 
<br>
significant portion of the species of the validity of this is a waste of 
<br>
time and therefore counterproductive.
<br>
<p>Mike's notion that because human nature derives from evolution and the 
<br>
physical universe that this translates a concept into a &quot;natural law&quot; is an 
<br>
irrational and mystical concept.  See Robert Anton Wilson''s &quot;The Myth of 
<br>
Natural Rights&quot;.
