Subject: Re: AI:This is how we do it
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I've seen several posts in this thread which made me wonder:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;Did he/she read GISAI and CFAI several times 'each' ?????&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Ugh. If that is a pre-requisite for starting or entering a discussion, then
<br>
there should be no discussion unless each person can prove that they have
<br>
done so. This is an open forum, and if someone does not have the
<br>
pre-requisite knowledge you believe they should know, then kindly refer them
<br>
to the information source. An even more radical approach would be to filter
<br>
out their messages if they continue to post until you get some notification
<br>
that they do have the background knowledge that you require for what you
<br>
consider cohesive communication. But like I said, this is a fairly open
<br>
forum (although the lower threshold of intelligence is high compared to most
<br>
other open forums).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  If he/she did, was it done with an open mind ? I think not. If I start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bla-bla-ing about planet disassembly without reading what the people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulated the hypothesis have to say, some pople on this list would get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pissed off. And rightly so.
</em><br>
<p>Not rightly so at all. For communication to happen, the sender must send a
<br>
clear signal, and the receiver must be receptive. In your role as a sender,
<br>
it is your responsibility to send a clear signal as you possibly can. To do
<br>
that effectively you must understand the capabilities of the receptor. If
<br>
you write a whole bunch of stuff that nobody reads, statistical probability
<br>
tells me that it's most likely to be your problem, not necessarily the
<br>
(potential) receiver's.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It works BOTH ways. I fully second Eli: there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***should have been** some progress **at least - really at least** at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptual level on CFAI and GISAI. Questions asked here, ***were***
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answered several times on the SL4 list which is archived online. Doing
</em><br>
'Sl4
<br>
<em>&gt; archive' at google pulls it. Searching on the 'Low Beyond' pulls it.
</em><br>
<p>And that's all a good learner needs to know. Maybe lesser learners require a
<br>
little more help, like hyperlinks, or a tailored summarization, or even a
<br>
discussion thread.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot understand, is the 'unspoken' undercurrent biased attitude about
</em><br>
CFAI
<br>
<em>&gt; and GISAI. I'm no fu**ing genius, I'm an everyday average curious kid. If
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; can grok most of what Eli writes, it's because I spend a lot of time
</em><br>
trying
<br>
<em>&gt; to see what he sees. I **spend a lot of time** trying to **see what
</em><br>
Eliezer
<br>
<em>&gt; was seeing** when writing/thinking about it. I 'hijack' his models.
</em><br>
<p>You have been adapting your learning model to be able to receive Eli's
<br>
message, tailored to Eli's style of communication. Most people are not
<br>
willing to do that because it takes too much energy. Personally, I think
<br>
most people write and talk too much anyway. Communication Theory and
<br>
Information Theory is a whole other domain that you may find interesting if
<br>
you are looking for a model of communication. Not interested? Oh well, I
<br>
tried.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Certain questions cannot be answered in one or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two lines. There's no magic stuff, it's all inter-connected and elements
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; only be understood if their profundly-complex relationships with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements are understood.
</em><br>
<p>Congratulations, you are well on the way of understanding the Eli
<br>
communication protocol standard. I hope the effort is worth it. I'm sure Eli
<br>
is modifying the protocol himself as he learns and continues to communicate.
<br>
His effectiveness and worthiness will be judged by how many people do
<br>
actually get the message without too much adjustment of their receptiveness.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I repeat: I **do not intend** to offend anyone, but Eli wrote GISAI and
</em><br>
CFAI
<br>
<em>&gt; for people to read/study/hack it. I do not believe it's done as often as
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; should be done. I also do not believe it has anything to do with how it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written.
</em><br>
<p>IMHO, you're wrong. Why should anyone care what he's written? Why should
<br>
anyone care what you write? We all have intent in our communication, but
<br>
there needs to be some sort of hook or link to the content that will grab
<br>
each person's interest so that they may decide whether it is worth their
<br>
time to actively pursue reading all that stuff. If you've gotten this far in
<br>
the email reply, I am honored that you find my opinion interesting enough to
<br>
read on ...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI community is known to have NO vocabulary. Why should Eli not create his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own if he feels that some things need to be formalized instead of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shoved under the carpet ?
</em><br>
<p>No vocabulary? I'm certain there is a lot of jargon. There are many AI
<br>
domain experts. As for formalized standards, it's not going to be defined in
<br>
natural language, that's for sure.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If Eli saw (or believed he did or does) where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Classical AI went wrong, so can I. If I can, so can everyone. The AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community has been attempting AI without understanding the human brain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is stupid. Anyone trying to do that will never get anything done in
</em><br>
AI.
<br>
<p>Would we have built a flying hot air balloon by studying how birds fly? I
<br>
don't disagree that there is a lot we can understand from the brain and our
<br>
neural network model, but there are other ways, even &quot;classical&quot; ways such
<br>
as expert systems and giant lookup tables that could work (inefficiently).
<br>
Or some other model (most likely).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yet, that is what the AI community did. They all got funky with buzzwords
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 'Expert systems' and used AI everywhere it had nothing to do with AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now that it's going down the drain coz of lack of results, anyone who even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretends to try creating AI in a different way (hint: Friendly Seed AI ) ,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is shot down in flames. That's a loser attitude, period.
</em><br>
<p>Friendliness and Seediness I see as different applications of AI, each with
<br>
its own purpose. These applications are programmed on top of a General AI,
<br>
which is the theoretical base of all AI. Maybe I'm wrong, but buzzwords are
<br>
just jargon, or language of the AI community's domain. Just because you
<br>
think someone doesn't &quot;get it&quot; like you do doesn't mean that they are losers
<br>
at all. Maybe it is you who doesn't get it. If you seek acceptance from a
<br>
community, you must find acceptable ways to focus their view. Complaining
<br>
about your unsuccessful attempts to show people your view makes you the
<br>
&quot;loser&quot;, if you must use that emotional term.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; PS: English ain't even my mother tongue, if I can get it, how hard can it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'conceptually' be ? Honestly ? *waves to everyone*
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no offense, but if English is not your mother tongue, it shows :-P
<br>
English is my only tongue, and I'm not really confident that you or anyone
<br>
else understands my messages either :-)
<br>
<p><p><p>cheers,
<br>
