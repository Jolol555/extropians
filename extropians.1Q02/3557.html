<p>&quot;WHich is all rather BS. I'll buy that Starfleet operates
<br>
communistically, much as many military organizations do today to a
<br>
limited extent...&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------
<br>
<p>If you check out the site, he addresses things like the Abolition of
<br>
property rights, State seizure of transportation services, State seizure of
<br>
communication services, Elimination of religion and traditional families,
<br>
State seizure of industry, Citizens are forced to work.  Just some examples:
<br>
<p>No wealth: Counsellor Troi and Captain Picard have both boasted about how
<br>
the accumulation of wealth is no longer an incentive. What they don't
<br>
explain is why. Humans have always been territorial (and so have our
<br>
evolutionary ancestors), so our desire to accumulate more assets seems more
<br>
like a basic facet of human nature than a temporary cultural phenomenon. It
<br>
can be suppressed or modified through education and social conditioning, but
<br>
such methods are hardly 100% effective. Some greedy people should remain,
<br>
but not in Star Trek. So if humans in the future no longer desire wealth,
<br>
then why not? Do they use extremely advanced brainwashing techniques, so
<br>
sophisticated that no one can resist them? Or have they made the
<br>
accumulation of wealth illegal, as Marx advocated? The latter seems more
<br>
plausible. 
<br>
US Navy ships are even more so.
<br>
<p>They're all company cars: What was the last time you saw a privately owned
<br>
personal starship? Starships are either government warships, diplomatic
<br>
vessels, or transports. The only one-person vehicles (apart from
<br>
non-Federation vehicles such as Quark's ship or Bajor's spacecraft) are
<br>
runabouts and shuttles, and they are always government property. Some might
<br>
argue that starships must be very expensive or difficult to operate and
<br>
therefore impractical for personal use, but Quark's ship disproved this
<br>
idea. 
<br>
<p>Ma Bell is back: The entire subspace relay system is owned by the Federation
<br>
government, as described in the DS9 tech manual. There is no private
<br>
competitor. Since all interstellar communications must use this relay
<br>
network, this effectively gives the Federation government total control over
<br>
long distance communications. Furthermore, it appears that local
<br>
communications systems are government-operated as well, since the government
<br>
was able to effortlessly impose a complete local news blackout during the
<br>
attempted coup in &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; As another monopolistic Microsoftian
<br>
measure, all communications start and end with the ubiquitous Federation
<br>
logo, even on mixed civilian/military stations like DS9. Quark once ran
<br>
afoul of this monopoly when he wanted to broadcast advertisements for his
<br>
bar, and had no alternative but to break into DS9's communications system. 
<br>
<p>Nietszche Wins- God is Dead: While the TOS episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot; began
<br>
with a wedding in the ship's chapel, no TNG era ship seems to have a chapel
<br>
at all. Christianity appears to have been purged from society. One of the
<br>
most extreme examples of this deliberate suppression can be seen in a recent
<br>
episode of Voyager, the holographic Doctor actually portrayed a Catholic
<br>
priest and conducted a ceremony, but somehow avoided mentioning the names
<br>
&quot;God&quot; or &quot;Jesus&quot; entirely! How someone can portray a priest and avoid
<br>
mentioning God or Jesus is beyond me. Also, while &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy often
<br>
mentioned Jesus and God, we never hear the name &quot;Jesus&quot; on TNG, DS9, or
<br>
Voyager. This situation exists in stark contrast to every other
<br>
civilization, such as the Bajorans, Klingons, Ferengi etc. which all have
<br>
their own curious religions (always precisely one religion per species; I
<br>
guess aliens aren't very imaginative in Star Trek). 
<br>
<p>etc. etc.
<br>
<p>He also gives qualitative estimates of how fully these various things are
<br>
implemented (not all are 100%)
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;A Captain living in the world of Starfleet would have little
<br>
need of
<br>
money if all of his/her needs were met by the starfleet replicator
<br>
technology. However, we rarely see in Star Trek anyone who isn't in
<br>
Starfleet who ISN'T engaged in private enterprise.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>He was referring to the federation specifically, how often do you see any
<br>
member race of the federation engaged in private enterprise?
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;Most of all, what is the point of naming the flagship of the
<br>
fleet
<br>
&quot;Enterprise&quot; if it is a communist society?&quot;
<br>
<p>Because the writers were merely idealistic english majors who had no concept
<br>
of economics or physics, and catered to the Whim's of roddenberry and
<br>
berman.  Just cause the ship is named 'Enterprise' does not mean that the
<br>
federation supports free enterprise.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;There are many incidents in Star Trek history of businessmen
<br>
operating
<br>
openly, even if some are depicted in a rather typically
<br>
biased-Roddenberry fashion (Harry Mudd, of &quot;Troubles with Tribbles&quot; and
<br>
other episodes of ST:TOS featuring him, including the one with the
<br>
beauty pills and dilithium miners, and the one where Harry meets his
<br>
apparent end at the hands of an android that appears as his ex wife....)&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>If you check the site out, he starts off (at some point) by saying that TOE
<br>
was mostly a free enterprise system, and joked that there must have been
<br>
some kind of coup in the intervening years.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;In ST:TNG, Capt. Picard's brother owns his own vinyard in
<br>
France, which
<br>
he labored to keep &quot;in the family&quot; while Picard went off to the stars.
<br>
Furthermore, the Ferengi ARE a part of the Federation, even if they are
<br>
looked down on by snooty starfleet types.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Interesting point, checking the database on his site I referenced above I
<br>
find
<br>
<p>Season 4, Ep# 78: &quot;Family&quot;
<br>
<p>(looking out over the vineyards) 
<br>
LOUIS: One man's idea of paradise. 
<br>
PICARD: Two men. Robert's. And my father's. 
<br>
LOUIS: Never did I know anyone less interested in grapes than you, Jean-Luc.
<br>
<p>PICARD: No, I was interested, Louis. And I was proud that my family helped
<br>
to preserve the traditions. But I did not feel bound by those traditions as
<br>
they seemed to be.
<br>
<p>His comments on the episode are...
<br>
<p>Culture: not once in the entire episode do we hear talk of sales, but we do
<br>
hear of traditions. It seems as if the Picard family vineyard exists simply
<br>
to provide scenery for the local community.
<br>
<p>This isn't unprecedented in real life. In certain European countries, some
<br>
farms are deliberately maintained despite economic unviability strictly for
<br>
reasons of aesthetics, so that tourists will see the quaint &quot;old world&quot;
<br>
agrarian lifestyles they've read about in books.
<br>
<p>If you watch this episode you may notice that their agricultural techniques
<br>
are strictly primitive: everything is done by hand, as it was done centuries
<br>
ago. This contradicts the common Trekkie argument that the Picard farm is
<br>
proof of capitalism in the Federation, since a capitalist farm would be much
<br>
more profitable using modern technology (never mind the advanced technology
<br>
they would presumably have in four centuries).
<br>
<p>At best, this would be analogous to modern &quot;throwback&quot; farms such as the
<br>
Amish and Orthodox Mennonite farms, which deliberately conduct their affairs
<br>
in a primitive manner. Of course, both of those religious sects preach that
<br>
money is the root of all evil, so a distinct resemblance hardly makes the
<br>
Federation look like a free-market society ...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Mike Lorry - &quot;Furthermore, in ST:DSN, there are numerous incidents of
<br>
private
<br>
businesspeople, including the Ferengi Quark, who owns his own bar/casino
<br>
on the space station, as well as the Cardassian tailor, who owns his own
<br>
shop.&quot;
<br>
<p>Are the Ferengi and the Cardassians actually MEMBERS of the Federation?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael
