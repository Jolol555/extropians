<br>
<p>A leading surgeon in the US has told BBC News that he is ready to perform the 
<br>
world's first transplant of an artificially grown organ. 
<br>
<p><p>Tissue engineering... should help reduce the number of patients on a 
<br>
transplant list 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Dr Anthony Atala  
<br>
Dr Anthony Atala, of the Boston Children's Hospital, says he hopes to put a 
<br>
laboratory-engineered bladder into a patient once he has obtained the 
<br>
necessary regulatory approval. 
<br>
<p>He believes permission for the procedure, which has been pioneered in dogs, 
<br>
will come within the next few months. 
<br>
<p>Dr Attalla says that if he is successful with the bladder transplant, he will 
<br>
attempt to repair damaged hearts with new muscle and possibly even try to 
<br>
grow a kidney. 
<br>
<p>Polymer ball 
<br>
<p>&quot;I think over time there will be no limit,&quot; Dr Atala said. &quot;I think it is 
<br>
just a question of figuring out all the different tissue types and cell types 
<br>
and how they work best, but eventually I think that following the same 
<br>
strategies just about every organ in the body will be repairable at the very 
<br>
least.&quot; 
<br>
<p>It was exactly two years ago that a team from the Laboratory for Tissue 
<br>
Engineering at the Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston 
<br>
announced that it had successfully implanted six beagle dogs with lab-grown 
<br>
bladders. 
<br>
<p>Tissue samples were taken from the animals' original bladders and these were 
<br>
used to cultivate the muscle cells and special bladder skin cells, called 
<br>
urothelial cells, needed to construct the artificial organs. 
<br>
<p>The multiplying cells were shaped into beagle bladders by bedding them down 
<br>
over polymer balls. Transplanted into the dogs, these lab-grown organs 
<br>
allowed the animals to urinate normally. 
<br>
<p>Important ally 
<br>
<p>Dr Atala believes his technique is sufficiently well developed that it could 
<br>
be used to treat a young child. 
<br>
<p>A lab-grown bladder could be the answer for a patient whose own organ has 
<br>
been destroyed by cancer or damaged by an infection or injury. 
<br>
<p>Dr Atala is seeking approval for human trials from the US Food and Drug 
<br>
Administration. 
<br>
<p>Although tissue engineering has huge potential, Dr Atala believes there will 
<br>
always be a need for donor organs. &quot;I think tissue engineering is just 
<br>
another solution but it should help reduce the number of patients on a 
<br>
transplant list.&quot; 
<br>
<p>And, he believes, tissue engineering will prove to be a useful ally to the 
<br>
emerging field of stem cell medicine, in which &quot;young&quot; cells are injected 
<br>
into ailing tissue to regenerate it. 
<br>
<p>&quot;For example, with a patient who has a failing heart, where obviously it 
<br>
would be very hard to get a biopsy because they would not tolerate the 
<br>
procedure; then I think stem cells would be the ideal answer.&quot;
