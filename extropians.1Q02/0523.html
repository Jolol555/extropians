</em><br>
<p>Which is not a meaningful statement. Somewhere around 500,000 to 750,000
<br>
Americans were killed in &quot;all the wars of the 20th century&quot;, or
<br>
approximately the same number of Americans killed in driving accidents
<br>
over a period of about 15 years, and the number of Americans killed by
<br>
medical malpractice in 5-7 years, and far less than the number of
<br>
Americans killed by things like heart disease, cancer, and drug and
<br>
alcohol addiction.
<br>
<p>The Spanish flu, in fact, did not target mostly young adults, it
<br>
targeted mostly children and old people. The Spanish flu was different
<br>
from other flus in that a higher than normal incidence of death among
<br>
young adult vicims did occur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/pandemics/">http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/pandemics/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem here, as the CDC point out, is that vaccine production (which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now available) typically takes 6 months, more than the likely warning of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pandemic.
</em><br>
<p>Depending on how close the pandemic's genetic markers are to known
<br>
strains. For instance, the CDC had been shivering in their shorts about
<br>
the potential of avian flu crossing over to humans as a great pandemic,
<br>
with no way to treat it since there had never been any known cases to
<br>
date. Finally, in the mid 90's, though, 6 cases showed up in Hong Kong
<br>
which were not particularly contagious, but they got samples and are now
<br>
able to make avian flu vaccines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the optimistic side, although a pandemic on this scale would be bad it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not likely to be an extinction event.
</em><br>
<p>Pandemics generally aren't extinction events. Victim species always have
<br>
enough genetic diversity, it seems, that some percentage is always going
<br>
to be immune or sufficiently resistant to the disease that they do not
<br>
die of it. Furthermore, diseases which kill every victim are poor
<br>
designs on an evolutionary basis, it seems. A disease needs survivors to
<br>
carry virus on to new regions to survive. Even Ebola has a 20-60%
<br>
survival rate, based on how well victims are treated. Additionally, when
<br>
a pandemic occurs, it seems that successive generations of virus grow
<br>
succeedingly less virulent and deadly, and the surviving target
<br>
population increasingly able to resist.
