</em><br>
<p>Very good post Kimberly.  I agree with you about the standards issue.  
<br>
It's a non-issue.  Women can be as fit or more fit than their male 
<br>
counterparts.  No question.  I will say that there aren't a whole lot of 
<br>
women that can AND are willing to endure the physical hardships associated 
<br>
with infantry work.  But certainly as the various adventure races have 
<br>
shown the world in the last decade, there are women that have the strength 
<br>
and endurance to compete in harsh environments on an equal basis with men.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now perhaps this is all due to &quot;lowered standards on behalf of women,&quot; but
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; joined and female physical fitness was an easy target for the opposition.
</em><br>
<p>Great point.  And very true.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Except for the most elite units, I expect that the majority of male
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiers do about the same, both emotionally and physically, as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of their female counterparts--I heard plenty of wheezing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whining from Marines of BOTH genders out on the 10K course.   I'm skeptical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the &quot;psychologically and physically unfit&quot; problem originated with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduction of women.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely right.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (To give credit where due,  I also saw some awesome athletic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performances--again from Marines of both genders.  There were men who could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vault over a six-feet fence like it wasn't there, and women who could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slither better than snakes under wire strung 6-inches above mud-pits.  Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to do well on hills--men made better time when the surfaces were dry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and packed, but on the hill that was drenched by a fire hose, the women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; climbed faster on the rough, slippery surface.)  
</em><br>
<p>It is said, though I've not seen the scientific data to back it up, that 
<br>
because of physiological differences, women can actually be better 
<br>
shooters than men.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; spaces pretty terrifying.  He was in no danger of getting stuck, but his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size made the situation very stressful.  The guide, a former North
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnamese commander, said he was &quot;glad they hadn't sent women&quot; down as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;tunnel rats&quot; during the war.  He also commented that some of their booby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traps (those that would let their own soldiers pass) could likely have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumvented by Western females.  So, it seems there's at least one &quot;real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world combat&quot; example where women could have served better than men.
</em><br>
<p>Undoubtedly there are lots of situations where some women are as well or 
<br>
better suited than some men.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Also interesting is the fact that the North Vietnamese are very proud of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their female soldiers.  (I saw three memorials to women and females appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prominently in the films and photo displays at several war museums.)  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard women as excellent fighters, and this in a society that otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks down on women.  The female soldiers probably weren't physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong, but apparently they were brave, determined, able to work alone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stealthy, and well suited to sneaking through the jungle.  In short, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were very well equipped for modern guerilla warfare.  The women also seemed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have worked just fine next to men in very close quarters and under very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rough combat conditions.  From what I gather, a lot of those &quot;psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sexual tension&quot; issues disappear when everyone's in serious danger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the &quot;issues&quot; during the Gulf War were due to the fact that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiers were bored and NOT under sustained dire threat.  Maybe there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much slack time that allowed for fooling around and better military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management could eliminate the problem.
</em><br>
<p>It's problematic to equate or evaluate the NVA in 1968 with the US Army 
<br>
today.  No doubt many many NVA females served with distinction.  And 
<br>
perhaps some of the sexual tension issues didn't occur in NVA units or 
<br>
occurred to a lesser extent, or maybe they overcame them altogether.  We 
<br>
don't know.  But we need to keep in mind that the NVA did not win in 
<br>
Vietnam due to their tactical superiority.  Pitched battles between NVA 
<br>
and US Army or Marine units in Vietnam were rarely won by the NVA, even 
<br>
accounting for the technological superiority of the Americans.  In 
<br>
addition, the morale of US forces at the time was by many accounts a low 
<br>
point in American military history, for a variety of reasons (none having 
<br>
to do with men and women in the same combat units).  In spite of the low 
<br>
morale, atrocious leadership, and flawed overall strategy, US forces 
<br>
routinely wreaked severe havoc on NVA units.  They won primarily because 
<br>
they were willing to sacrifice many many more of their people to achieve 
<br>
victory than the American people were.
<br>
<p>The other discontinuity between us and them, then and now, is that North 
<br>
Vietnam was fighting for it's very survival as a nation.  In the same way 
<br>
that Israeli women fought along side the men during the 1948 War of 
<br>
Independence, and Russian women served in large numbers during WWII, 
<br>
Vietnamese women were desperately needed to fill out the ranks.  Desperate 
<br>
times require desperate measures.  And in those times those not normally 
<br>
afforded the &quot;privilege&quot; of serving in frontline combat do so gallantly 
<br>
and fulfill some very specialized roles.  But that might not be the best 
<br>
justification for fully integrating front-line combat units in a modern 
<br>
and well equipped army.  We certainly don't know if the sexual tension 
<br>
issues simply disappeared in these cases or if desperation and other 
<br>
factors allowed them to prevail in spite of the ever-present and 
<br>
disruptive issues associated with integration.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't intend any of these comments as arguments in favor of &quot;lowered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards&quot; for women or as negations of the existence of &quot;special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment&quot; in certain circumstances for women.  However, &quot;special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment&quot; exists for guys too in the form of &quot;old boy's&quot; networks that let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unqualified males slide by.  Let's get rid of ALL of it.  
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;some snippage&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the luxury of saying women are simply too &quot;problematic in service&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we haven't faced enough of a threat to really take the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously--we haven't had to leverage absolutely every bit of available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talent.  I hope we never confront such a formidable enemy; it sounds like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our social, sexual, and philosophical sensitivities might limit us to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half-strength response. 
</em><br>
<p>Like I said above, I think the issues are much more complex than &quot;we just 
<br>
have to get over it&quot;.  And as I've said a couple of times, I'd like to see 
<br>
us overcome the conservative religious mindsets and social/cultural 
<br>
attitudes that would make fully integrated front-line combat units viable. 
<br>
Amara suggested the Antarctic scientists as an example of successful 
<br>
integration under trying circumstances.  But scientists in a harsh 
<br>
environment are not 18 year old privates in a harsh environment trying to 
<br>
kill or be killed.  We can wish that the average 18 year old from 
<br>
heartland America would have the same maturity level and standard of 
<br>
professionalism that the average 30 or 40-something scientist has, or that 
<br>
the collegial atmosphere within a heated Antarctic science station was the 
<br>
functional equivalent of a foxhole on a modern battlefield.  But they are 
<br>
not.  And wishing it away or mandating that people just grow up and be 
<br>
mature and act professionally doesn't reduce the turmoil caused by some 
<br>
very fundamental physical and psychological and social realities.  There's 
<br>
no doubt in my mind that eventually, over time, as social norms change, as 
<br>
the emphasis on religious dogma as a rule for living (hopefully) 
<br>
diminishes, as technology advancements change the nature and frequency and 
<br>
intensity of traditional frontline combat, men and women will be able to 
<br>
achieve full equality on the battlefield...geeezuz what a thing to be 
<br>
wishing for...
<br>
<p>The question becomes, do we want to test the theory against the fate of 
<br>
the nation when we don't have to?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As a final note...the equal and rational application of standards would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely result in a great reduction in the number of women qualifying for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional combat, and a great reduction in the number of men meeting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards for submarine service and the ASTRONUAT PROGRAM.   Aside from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few jokes about Minsky's comment, and Spike's &quot;legless woman&quot; proposal, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see numerous outraged postings about sloppy performance by women in jobs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they shouldn't hold, but I see scant outrage on the list about &quot;standards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slide&quot; when it comes to men.  Why not?  As forced taxpayers, we certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get stuck with the bill for both classes of substandard performance. (Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixing the space program might be an easier first step than fixing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military...)
</em><br>
<p>And again, we are in complete agreement.
<br>
