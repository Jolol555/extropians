<em>&gt; In a mixed libertarian-leaning democracy-compromise government, the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some certain emission (or extraction), and issue trading rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Companies would buy and sell pollution rights on the free market; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total level of pollution would be fixed (hopefully at roughly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustainable level), but who did the pollution would end up being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whoever produced the greatest benefit from it and was therefore able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to offer the highest price.  Higher prices would encourage research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into alternatives, and lower prices would encourage some people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy up the rights and bury them, reducing the overall levels.
</em><br>
<p>If pollution rights are deemed to be evenly split among all the humans in
<br>
the world, then the market in environmental credits (go ahead, just try
<br>
and sell &quot;pollution credits&quot;) may provide a small amount of income for
<br>
developing countries and low-income individuals.  Hopefully, this would
<br>
not have the usual problems attendant with wealth-redistribution schemes
<br>
and totally unearned income.
<br>
<p>I don't think it would take much longer than five minutes before people
<br>
started complaining about too many credits, not enough credits, prices
<br>
being manipulated, and even antipoverty activists complaining about
<br>
low-pollution environmentalist technologies driving down market prices,
<br>
but hopefully the effect would remain positive despite the inevitable
<br>
bickering.
