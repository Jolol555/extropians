<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ANARCHY #42&quot; Anti-copyright 1995 by B.A.L. Press, New York
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
By contrast, the anarcho-Extropian or futurians are also forced to
<br>
reify the eschaton -since the present is obviously not the utopia of
<br>
techné they envision- by placing perfection in a future where symbolic
<br>
mediation has abolished hierarchy, rather than in a past where such
<br>
mediation has not yet appeared (the ideal Paleolithic of the
<br>
primitivists). Obviously for the Extropians, mediation per se cannot be
<br>
defined as &quot;impurity&quot; or as the invariable source of separation,
<br>
alienation, and hierarchy. Nevertheless, it remains obvious that such
<br>
separation does in fact occur, that it amounts to immiseration, that it
<br>
is bound up in some way with techné and mediation, that not all
<br>
technology is &quot;liberating&quot; according to any anarchist definition of the
<br>
term, and that some of it is downright oppressive. The Extropian
<br>
therefore lacks and needs a critique of technology, and of the
<br>
incredibly complex relation between the social and the technical. No
<br>
one with any intelligence can any longer accept the notion of
<br>
technology as &quot;morally neutral,&quot; with control of the means of
<br>
production the only criteria for valuation. The social and the
<br>
technological are somehow bound in a complex relation of co-creation
<br>
(or &quot;co-evolution&quot;), such that techné shapes cognition even as
<br>
cognition shapes techné. If the extropian vision of the future is
<br>
viable it cannot depend on &quot;machine evolution&quot; alone to achieve
<br>
realization. But unless anarcho-futurism can develop a critique of
<br>
technology, it is relegated precisely to this passive role. Invariably
<br>
a dialectic of &quot;good&quot; machines and &quot;evil&quot; machines is developed, or
<br>
rather of good and evil modes of social-technological relations. This
<br>
rather manichaean worldview however fails to efiminate or even plaster
<br>
over the contradictions which arise from such premises, and which
<br>
revolve around the &quot;bad-fit&quot; between human values and machine &quot;logic,&quot;
<br>
human autonomy and machine autonomy.
<br>
[...]
<br>
Now, when I talk about &quot;the return of the Paleolithic&quot; I find myself
<br>
leaning toward the primitivist position -and have consequently been
<br>
criticized by extropians for luddoid reaction, nostalgism, and
<br>
technophobia. However, when I talk about (say) the potential use of the
<br>
Internet in organizing a TAZ, I begin to tilt a little toward my old
<br>
SciFi enthusiasms and sound a bit like an extropian-and have
<br>
consequently been criticized by primitivists for being &quot;soft on
<br>
technology&quot; (like some sort of melting watch by Dali), seduced by
<br>
techno-optimism, by the illusion that separation can overcome
<br>
separation.
<br>
<p>Both these criticisms are correct to some degree, inasmuch as my
<br>
inconsistency results from an attempt to think about techné and society
<br>
without any recourse to an inviolate system of absolute categories. On
<br>
the one hand, most of my thinking about technology was shaped by the
<br>
radical ad-hoc-ism and bricolage theory of the '60s and '70s, the
<br>
&quot;appropriate tech&quot; movement, which accepts the de facto link between
<br>
techné and human society, but looks for appropriate ways to shape
<br>
situations toward low-cost/maximal-pleasure tendencies. In fiction a
<br>
model is attempted by B. Sterling in his short-story &quot;Green Days in
<br>
Brunei,&quot; a brilliant imagining of low-tech non-authoritarian solutions
<br>
to &quot;3rd world&quot; over-population and poverty. In &quot;real&quot; life a smaller
<br>
but most exquisite model is provided by the New Alchemy Institute,
<br>
which turns polluted sinkholes into arcadian springs with low green
<br>
technologies in cheap installations which are aesthetically beautiful.
<br>
On the other hand, I prefer the burden of inconsistency (even &quot;foolish&quot;
<br>
inconsistency) to the burden of the Absolute. Only an impure theory can
<br>
do justice to the impurity of the present -which, as everyone knows, is
<br>
only a psychological impossibility caught between a lost past and a
<br>
nonexistent future.
<br>
<p>&quot;Everyday life&quot; is not a category -even &quot;the body&quot; is not a category.
<br>
Life -and the body- are &quot;full of holes,&quot; permeable, grotesque -ad hoc
<br>
constructions already compromised with an impure empiricism, fated to
<br>
&quot;drift,&quot; to &quot;relativism,&quot; and to the sheer messiness of the organic.
<br>
And yet it is &quot;precisely&quot; here, in this imprecise area of contradiction
<br>
and &quot;vulgar existentialism,&quot; that the creative act of autonomy and
<br>
self-actualization must be accomplished. Critiques can be directed at
<br>
the past or future, but praxis can only occur in the impure and
<br>
ontologically unstable here-and-now. I don't want to abandon the
<br>
critique of past-and-future-in fact I need it, in the form of a utopian
<br>
poetics, in order to situate praxis in the context of a tradition (of
<br>
festivity and of resistance) and of an anti-tradition (of utopian
<br>
&quot;hope&quot;). But I cannot allow this critique to harden into an
<br>
eschatology. I ask of theory that it remain flexible in, regard to
<br>
situations, and able to define values in terms of &quot;the struggle for
<br>
empirical freedoms&quot; (as one modern-day Zapatista put it). &quot;Revolution&quot;
<br>
no less than Religion has been guilty of promising &quot;pie in the sky&quot; (as
<br>
Joe Hill put it) -but the real problem of theory is (as Alice put it)
<br>
&quot;jam today.&quot; The concept of the TAZ was never intended as an
<br>
abandonment of past or future -the TAZ- existed, and will exist -but
<br>
rather as a means to maximize autonomy and pleasure for as many
<br>
individuals and groups as possible as soon as possible -even here and
<br>
now. The TAZ exists -the purpose of the theory has been simply to
<br>
notice it, help it to define itself, become &quot;politically conscious.&quot;
<br>
The past and future help us to know our &quot;true&quot; (revolutionary) desires
<br>
but only the present can realize them -only the living body, for all
<br>
its grotesque imperfection.
<br>
<p>Suppose we were to ask -as anarchists- what should be done about the
<br>
problem of technology &quot;after the revolution.&quot; This exercise in utopian
<br>
poetics may help us to clarify the question of desire, and of praxis in
<br>
the &quot;present.&quot; The primitivist might argue that there can be no
<br>
revolution without the abolition of symbolic mediation, or at least of
<br>
the technological imperative; extropians might say that no revolution
<br>
can occur without technological transcendence. But both parties must
<br>
perforce admit a transitional stage, when de facto power has been
<br>
seized by the &quot;Revolution,&quot; but the full unfolding of revolutionary
<br>
society has yet to occur. Let's imagine that the one rough principle
<br>
agreed upon by &quot;everyone&quot; is the freedom of the individual from
<br>
coercion by the group, and the freedom of the (self-organized) group
<br>
from coercion by all other groups. The only &quot;price&quot; of this freedom is
<br>
that it damage no other free and autonomous interests. This would seem
<br>
to be a minimalistic but adequate definition of basic anarchism. At
<br>
this point the primitivist may hold that the dialectic of freedom moves
<br>
irrevocably toward the re-appearance of the Paleolithic, albeit at a
<br>
&quot;higher&quot; and more conscious level than the first time around, since
<br>
this re-appearance will have been announced by revolution, by
<br>
consciousness. Similarly at this point the extropian may argue that the
<br>
further unfolding of freedom can only be envisioned as self-directed
<br>
evolution through the co-creation of humanity and its technology. Fine
<br>
and dandy. But now what? Are these two anarchist tendencies going to
<br>
become armies and fight it out to the last recalcitrant computer jock
<br>
or neo-wild-man? Are they going to force their visions of the future on
<br>
each other? Would such action be consistent with the basic anarchist
<br>
premise of -mutual non-coercion? Or would it reveal each of these
<br>
tendencies to be flawed by destructive and tragic contradictions?
<br>
[...]
<br>
Of course, everyone is free to play this game of utopian poetics with
<br>
different &quot;rules,&quot; and different results. After all, the future does
<br>
not exist. However, I would like to push the implications of my
<br>
thought-experiment a bit further. I suspect that this &quot;utopia&quot; would
<br>
prove disappointing to both the primitives and the extropians. I
<br>
suspect that a workable utopia would adhere more closely to the &quot;messy&quot;
<br>
model than to either of the &quot;pure&quot; models of the pro-tech/anti-tech
<br>
theorists. Like bolo'bolo, I imagine a complex multiplicity of social
<br>
models co-existing under the voluntary aegis of the social &quot;price&quot; of
<br>
mutual non-coercion. In effect the primitivists will get less
<br>
wilderness than they demand, and the extropians will get less tech.
<br>
Nevertheless, all but the most fanatical extremists on either side will
<br>
be reconciled to the messy utopia of desire or so I predict -because it
<br>
will be organized around pleasure and surplus, rather than the denial
<br>
and scarcity expressed by the totality. The desire for wilderness will
<br>
be gratified at a level undreamed since the early Neolithic, and the
<br>
desire for creativity and even co-creation will be gratified at a level
<br>
undreamed by the wildest science fiction. In both cases the means for
<br>
this enjoyment can only be called appropriate techné -green, low
<br>
energy, high information. I don't believe in the abolition of symbolic
<br>
mediation, and I don't believe that separation can overcome separation.
<br>
But I do hypothesize the possibility of a much more immediate and
<br>
satisfactory experience of creation and conviviality through the human
<br>
(animal/animate) scaling of economy and technology -and this, however
<br>
untidy, I would call utopia.
<br>
<p>If I have disagreed with both primitives and extropians here, it was
<br>
not to reject them as allies. The only useful purpose served by our
<br>
&quot;after the Revolution&quot; game is to shed light on our present situation,
<br>
and our possible options for concrete action here and now (more or
<br>
less). It seems to me that both the P's and E's are quite capable of
<br>
grasping the theory of &quot;messiness&quot; and the &quot;impure&quot; model of the TAZ. A
<br>
night, a week, a month of relative autonomy, relative satisfaction,
<br>
relative realization, would be worth far more to most anarchists than a
<br>
whole lifetime of absolute bitterness, resentment, and nostalgia for
<br>
the past or future. The most enthusiastic cyberpunk can still embrace
<br>
the &quot;festal body,&quot; and the most savage primitives have been known to
<br>
succumb to civilized impurities such as beer, or art. I fear that a few
<br>
diehards in both camps will still sneer at our enjoyment -of the impure
<br>
TAZ or the impure uprising- because it falls short of the perfect
<br>
revolution. But realization arises only from direct experience, from
<br>
participation. They themselves admit this. And yet action is always
<br>
impure, always incomplete. Are they too fastidious? Will nothing suit
<br>
them both besides the void-wither of wilderness, or of cyberspace? Are
<br>
they dandies of the Absolute?
<br>
[...]
<br>
But at this present moment the TAZ (in its broadest possible sense)
<br>
seems to be the only manifestation of the possibility of radical
<br>
conviviality. Every non-authoritarian tendency should support the TAZ
<br>
because only there (aside from the imagination) can an authentic taste
<br>
of life without oppression be experienced. The vital question now
<br>
concerns the &quot;technology&quot; of the TAZ, i.e., the means for potentiating
<br>
and manifesting it most clearly and strongly. Compared to this
<br>
question, the problems of technology (or of zero-technology) take on an
<br>
air of theological debate -a ghostly and querulous other- worldliness.
<br>
My critics have a point -but it's aimed somewhere about 10,000 years in
<br>
the past, or &quot;five minutes into the future,&quot; and misses the mark.
<br>
<p>I must admit that my own taste inclines neither toward Wilderness World
<br>
nor spaceship Earth as exclusive categories. I actually spend far more
<br>
time defending wildness than &quot;civilization,&quot; because it is far more
<br>
threatened. I yearn for the re-appearance of Nature out of Culture-but
<br>
not for the eradication of all symbolic mediation. The word &quot;choice&quot;
<br>
has been so devalued lately. Let's say I'd prefer a world of
<br>
indeterminacy, of rich ambiguity, of complex impurities. My critics,
<br>
apparently, do not. I find much to admire and desire in both their
<br>
models, but can't for even a moment believe in either of them as
<br>
totalities. Their futurity or eschatology bores me, unless I can mix it
<br>
into the stew of the TAZ -or use it to magic the TAZ into active
<br>
existence- to tease the TAZ into action. The TAZ is &quot;broad-minded&quot;
<br>
enough to entertain more than two, or even six, impossible ideas
<br>
&quot;before breakfast.&quot; The TAZ is always &quot;bigger&quot; than the mere ideas
<br>
which inspire it. Even at its smallest and most intimate the TAZ
<br>
englobes all &quot;totalities,&quot; and packs them into the same kaleidoscope
<br>
conceptual space, the &quot;imaginal world&quot; which is always so closely
<br>
related to the TAZ, and which burns with the same fire. My brain may
<br>
not be able to reconcile the wilderness and cyberspace, but the TAZ can
<br>
do so - in fact, has already done so. And yet the TAZ is no totality,
<br>
but merely a leaky sieve-which, in the fairy tale, can carry milk or
<br>
even become a boat. For the TAZ, technology is like that paper fan in
<br>
the Zen story, which first becomes a &quot;fan,&quot; then a device for scooping
<br>
cake, and finally a silent breeze.
