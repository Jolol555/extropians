<p><p>Simply quit.  Unlike with heroin, there are no &quot;jones&quot; strong 
<br>
enough to kill you.  I smoked 20 years and quit cold-turkey 11 
<br>
years ago.  Once I decided (meaning &quot;to cut off any 
<br>
alternative&quot;) it wasn't that bad.  I was spacey and feeling 
<br>
wierd for a week and a little so for a month but it was not 
<br>
insurmountable.  Do schedule some low pressure time in the very 
<br>
beginning though.
<br>
<p>Part of what helped me was imaginging a big fat Jesse Helms 
<br>
(senator from my home tobacco state) sitting on a big pile of 
<br>
tobacco mixed with the bodies of human victims, laughing 
<br>
demonically and counting his gold.  I imagined good friends of 
<br>
mine who smoked and even me among the victims, robbed of even 
<br>
this short life much less Singularity.  And I got really, really 
<br>
pissed.  I would remember it every time I thought about giving 
<br>
up and copping a smoke.  Something else that helped was being so 
<br>
determined to quit that even if the withdrawal killed me (which 
<br>
it certainly couldn't) I would rather die than continue enslaved 
<br>
to those damn poison sticks.  Another thing that helped was 
<br>
remembering that the oh so logical rationalizations that the 
<br>
mind will come up with are really &quot;the addiction talking&quot;. 
<br>
Ignore those just as you would if a foreign entity could inject 
<br>
thoughts straight into your brain.  When you're addicted, that 
<br>
isn't that far from the truth.
<br>
<p>Even with all the above I did have brief back-sliding periods of 
<br>
a month or less a few times in the last decade.  But after being
<br>
clean for so long my body felt so poisoned by taking it up again 
<br>
and I was so disgusted about buying into it that quitting from 
<br>
those was much easier (although it was still work).  I haven't 
<br>
been tempted seriously in the last five years.  It helps that my 
<br>
original reaction to smoke (from before I started) has 
<br>
reinstated itself.  I choke and feel nauseated to be around it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I despise the way it makes my clothes smell to be 
<br>
around smokers.
<br>
<p>Good luck.  You CAN do it.  Once you are determined to.
