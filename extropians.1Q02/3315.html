</em><br>
<p>The quick-and-dirty reply is - it's about you.  Of course, there could be
<br>
extenuating situations ... you are dying of starvation, you find a wallet -
<br>
you decide to &quot;borrow&quot; a few bucks for food (saying to yourself, as soon as
<br>
you get some grub, you can think about getting a job, and repaying the
<br>
money).
<br>
<p>Throughout my life I've found a few wallets and have always returned them to
<br>
their owners.  It never even occurred for me not to.  It's always a steeper
<br>
price ... to sell your integrity out over a few bucks, yes?
<br>
<p>I'm not certain how the &quot;world as a whole&quot; fits into the finding-a-wallet
<br>
scenario -- oh, but wait ... there are the likes of Kenneth Lay, whose
<br>
selfish antics are having far-reaching effects not unlike stealing money out
<br>
of ALL our wallets (via the stock market, our IRAs, 401-Ks and the like).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yeah, it's odd. I must be a crypto deontologist, via residual childhood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming, although I tell myself I'm a rule utilitarian. A former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grrlfriend once informed me merrily about an acquaintance who, I dunno,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow activated an ATM withdrawal with the wrong PIN and got several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred dollars, which she kept; my friend made it clear she'd do the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a trice. I was taken aback.
</em><br>
<p>I'm a crypto, too.  When my children were young, I cannot tell you how many
<br>
parents I observed who thought it was all right to lie about how old their
<br>
children were - to sneak them into movie theaters and such at a reduced
<br>
price.  I didn't think this set a very good example.  It may be a minor
<br>
thing, but I've never figured out where one draws the line (although I can
<br>
imagine circumstances where I would lie my head off and consider it quite
<br>
ethical - e.g., in some variation of a &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; dilemma, or in
<br>
harboring Anne Frank and her family, pokata ... pokata ... pokata).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was the beginning of the end for a beautiful relationship, now that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look back on that moment...
</em><br>
<p>Yep, know the feeling.  Luckily (and not accidentally), all three of my
<br>
each-quite-different husbands had this one thing in common:  unimpeachable
<br>
integrity.  Years after we were divorced, when the IRS gave my last husband
<br>
(#2) a return for deductions which were overlooked for taxes during one year
<br>
when we were married, he sent me me my share ($3,000 - nice surprise!).  He
<br>
could have rationalized keeping the money, I'm sure - and how would I ever
<br>
have known?  But he was and is - upstanding (and that's why we're still good
<br>
friends).
