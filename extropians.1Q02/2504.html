<em>&gt;From: &quot;Alex Ramonsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alex@ramonsky.com?Subject=Re:%20MEDIA,%20UK:%20how%20to%20build%20a%20human">alex@ramonsky.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;Subject: Re: MEDIA, UK: how to build a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was wondering when someone would notice this...half expected to see some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more of you guys on it...The UK media does this: it chucks things at people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In at the deep end, a little like the style of 'Great Mambo Chicken' did way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back whenever. Be assured the program isn't aimed at kids...it's aimed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the average British person's knowledge of science...and more. It's going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause as many endless debates as GM food did last year.
</em><br>
<p>I've seen it and checked out the website, but I won't be able to add to the 
<br>
online debate until tomorrow.  Gotta gather my thoughts....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But with one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essential difference...this programme comes out apparently firmly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positive side of new tech. And, as you say, at least some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'spokespersons' know what they're on about.
</em><br>
<p>Very true.  I was expecting the usual hatchet job, wondering when the 
<br>
&quot;buts&quot; would appear, followed by the obligatory spiel from the 
<br>
Eco-spokesperson or Right Reverand Killjoy.  But they stayed very much 
<br>
within the topics presented, and very much focussed on possible benefits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The debates are going to be heated and over the top for about six months,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after which things will settle into the traditional British habit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'people-getting-bored-with-it-all-and-they-don't-really-understand-it-anyway
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- -so-who-cares?' Meaning, simply, that people on the whole will forget about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it all again.
</em><br>
<p>Heh heh, that about sums it :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But which is the best tactic here? -Any publicity is good publicity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or -stay out of the news; stay out of trouble?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What thinkest thou?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ramonsky
</em><br>
<p>Publicity is in general good, provided it is reasonably balanced.  Those 
<br>
who support or oppose it aren't likely to change sides anytime soon.  But 
<br>
it's the middle ground people who will make the difference, and your 
<br>
average middle grounder, given a little time, will be wanting the new tech 
<br>
for him/her self.
<br>
<p>Most people, when it gets right down to it, will pick life over death, and 
<br>
the argument that they are stealing resources from some kid in the third 
<br>
world will be so distant from their frame of reference that it'll be 
<br>
ineffective.  Most aren't too worried if it steals it from their 
<br>
neightbour, let alone someone half a world away.  They won't buy that 
<br>
argument in relation to the BMW they just bought or their new villa on the 
<br>
Riviera, and it'll be much harder again to make a direct connection between 
<br>
them living longer and some claimed side effect on the worlds poor.
<br>
<p>As I've said before, people don't yet know how &quot;handy&quot; extended health/life 
<br>
will be.  But safe and effective near term products would do a whole lot to 
<br>
help that.  Trouble is, how long will they take to appear?
<br>
<p>I think, overall, the programme presented genetic technology as an exciting 
<br>
new thing with much promise for the average middle grounder.  And that is 
<br>
exactly the sort of exposure needed.
<br>
<p><p><p>James....
<br>
<p>BTW, it's good to see Nick Bostroms' excellent item on LE again on the BBC 
<br>
website!  I remember seeing the original showing on the &quot;Heart of the 
<br>
Matter&quot; programme a few years back.
<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
