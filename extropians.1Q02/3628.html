<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;No, it doesn't. The advent of replicator technology has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive for fulfillment of basic needs through labor. Furthermore, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federation citizens you generally only see in TNG are Starfleet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officers, trained at Starfleet Academy. These are scientists whose every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need is supplied by Starfleet from the moment of their induction. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they need personal items, they are replicated, so the concept of 'cost'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for personal items and consumables is obsolete.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      ------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He makes a good argument on the site that the replicators require a feed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stock (some sort of raw materials) since in numerous episodes they state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many compounds are too complex to synthesize.  Which would still place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high value on those materials that could not be replicated, never mind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhorbitant cost in energy to replicate them (unless the majority of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes from feedstock) In either case, TOS also had replicators on board, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they seemed to still have a market based economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are his comments about replicators with quotes from each episode
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Database/TNG-Replicators.html">http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Database/TNG-Replicators.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>If TOS had replicators, they were never referred to as such in any
<br>
episodes that I recall. I always thought that the compartments that
<br>
characters took meals out of were nothing but microwave oven/food
<br>
reconstitutors (yes, you never saw anyone put anything INTO them, but
<br>
when NBC airtime cost thousands of bucks a minute, and you can't even
<br>
afford to make decent antennae for an alien character, you aren't going
<br>
to waste camera time sitting around waiting for the microwave oven...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;Now, lets say that God has either been proven to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-existent, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else federation technology has allowed private individuals to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct comm line with the universes sysop. In either case, chapels would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be unnecessary, but what, exactly, does this have to do with capitalism?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      ---------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think its more the fact that the TNG stayed away from any religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications of any kind in the federation (probably cause the writeres
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didnt know how to handle it and paramount didnt want to offend anyone) yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most every alien race encountered has a religion.  In the federation, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be strangely absent (with the exception of Picard's brothers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments apparently)  I think the lack of a god has a lot to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communism (not capitalism) as marx said 'religion is the opiate of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masses'  If the author is arguing that the federation is communist, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good line of evidentary support to show the lack of religions in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federation, since communist nations typically avoid or actively persecute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions.  Whether you agree with the authors conclusions or not, its hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me to imagine that you didnt see why he used that piece of evidence.
</em><br>
<p>I don't need marx to explain a lack of religion in the future. It's
<br>
obvious anyone in Starfleet is going to be highly trained as scientists,
<br>
and through travel througout the galaxy, there would be little need to
<br>
worship gods which don't exist (especially since Kirk defeated the gods
<br>
in TOS, as you might recall, then when you defeat your gods, why
<br>
continue to worship them?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you check the site out, he starts off (at some point) by saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TOE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was mostly a free enterprise system, and joked that there must have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some kind of coup in the intervening years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;Note that replicators did not exist in the TOE period, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did exist in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the TNG era, supporting my theory.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      ---------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Replicators werent in the original series?  What were those little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cubbyholes that they would walk up to, say something, a door slides open,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and out comes food.  Is there a kitchen back there?  Or was I hallucinating?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They had transportors, why not replicators?
</em><br>
<p>Why not transporters to transport meals into the cubbyhole from the ship
<br>
kitchen? ;) Talk about 'have it your way'...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;This is inaccurate. Note how farms in Japan still use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor, hand polishing apples while still on the tree, etc and as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result command a far higher market price than mass produced American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products, even of the same species. Note that 'authentic' french
</em><br>
<em>&gt; champagne produced using traditional methods commands higher prices than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass produced American &quot;champagne&quot; which is produced by the same method,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but automated, though is not allowed to be called 'champagne'. Note also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the organic farming movement, which commands higher prices for its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce than non'organic' produce.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      -------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I certainly wouldnt go so far as to say it is 'innacurate' as it is merely a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different interpreation of an observed phenomena,  Fact, they have a low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tech hand worked farm.  Explanation, could be in a memory or throw back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'old days' in a communist society, or it could be a high priced organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farm for technophobes.  Why is your interpretation more correct then his?
</em><br>
<p>Because my interpretation exists in fact today, and Occam's razor
<br>
therefore says I'm right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is not any more evidence to suggest either explanation more clearly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the exception of the rest of the anecdotal evidence from the series,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you interpret as being evidence of a free market society, and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interprets as being evidence of a communist one (at least in TNG)  Seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that to determine which explanation is a simpler one for the observed facts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should take the debate up with him, as you (as he) seems (IMHO) to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some good points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In either case, you should probably not be arguing with me about it as A) I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am not the author of the site and B) not a very big star trek fan.  P
</em><br>
<p>I'm not a big star trek fan either, although I've seen far more than my
<br>
fair share of episodes over the years, mostly due to a lack of much else
<br>
to watch. And I do see why picking on TNG would work, because I used to
<br>
gripe about the show back when it was new, calling it The Politically
<br>
Correct Generation, while DSN was simply Deep Sixed... Voyager was far
<br>
better than either of those, and I am really enjoying Enterprise (the
<br>
new show, set before The Old Show). 
<br>
<p>Picard's multi-season pussilanimous unwillingness to a) engage in
<br>
combat, and b) doing so badly after all else failed and getting his butt
<br>
saved by Riker or one of the other characters, as well as his insistence
<br>
that Enterprise &quot;IS NOT A WARSHIP&quot;, always annoyed the hell out of me.
<br>
You don't arm the fastest ship in the fleet with weaponry capable of
<br>
frying a planet if it's not a 'warship'. Sure, once the Borg came along,
<br>
he kinda got his ass in gear, but would still waste time if given the
<br>
chance on Hamletian indecisive nattering about pros and cons that
<br>
reminds me of a certain prior presidential administration. 
<br>
<p>Riker, Data, Worf, and Q were the best characters in the series.
