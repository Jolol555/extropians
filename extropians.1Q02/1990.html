<p><p>As someone who grew up around gobs of fruit trees of all types, I would say
<br>
your first reason is the correct one.  A healthy fruit tree produces a *LOT*
<br>
of fruit, even a small one, and depending on the type of tree may produce
<br>
all year.  There are three things you can do about it:  1) Do nothing and
<br>
have a very nasty and unsightly mess, 2) pay someone to cleanup and maintain
<br>
the trees, or 3) pay someone to spray hormones that keep the tree from
<br>
producing fruit.
<br>
<p>If all the trees were fruit trees, not cleaning up the mess wouldn't be an
<br>
option or you would be swimming in rotten fruit goop.  Paying someone to
<br>
clean up fallen fruit several times a week would get expensive.  Paying
<br>
someone to spray hormones to keep the fruit from producing (the preferred
<br>
choice in regions here where people are inundated with fruit) would defeat
<br>
the original purpose.  Having a ton of fruit trees seems like a neat idea
<br>
until you've actually been in that scenario; it really only takes a few
<br>
fruit trees to satisfy the demand of an entire neighborhood.  Planting a few
<br>
fruit trees would be alright if people were consuming the fruit, but if you
<br>
are planting a lot of trees you'll want most of them to be the &quot;non-fruit
<br>
producing&quot; kind.
<br>
<p>I think part of the reason I don't eat much fruit today (though I do it lots
<br>
of veggies) is that I got truly sick of fruit as child, since there was a
<br>
bottomless supply of free fruit of all types growing in our neighborhood.  I
<br>
think the few small trees in our yard alone were producing several pounds of
<br>
fruit a day in peak season.  One of the hazards of when fruit trees grow
<br>
like weeds.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
