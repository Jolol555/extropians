<em>&gt; &gt; This morning's SJ Merc has an article about a widow from

</em><br>

<p>I was delighted to see the Texas legislature having to face this
<br>
down.  One imagine the cowboy lawyers sitting around
<br>
saying &quot;Boys, we either hafta recognize the legitimacy of
<br>
transgender surgery or the legitimacy of homosexual marriage.
<br>
If we recognize neither, then we are saying the transgender
<br>
has not the human right to marry, implying that the transgender
<br>
is not human.  The brain makes the human, so we would be
<br>
saying that the brain resides in that organ that was removed in
<br>
transgender surgery.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am further delighted to see these issues dealt with at the
<br>
state level, for not every state legislature will decide the
<br>
same way.  Some would then decide to acknowledge
<br>
homosexual marriage.  Some states would decide to
<br>
recognize both the legitimacy of transgender surgery
<br>
and homosexual marriage.
<br>
<p>Of those states that decided acknowledge transgender
<br>
marriage only and not homosexual marriage, some will get
<br>
hopelessly bogged down in the details.  For instance, at
<br>
what stage of gender transformation does the person become
<br>
the target gender?  Whenever they say?  Does a doctor need
<br>
to declare the transformation more than halfway done?  Can
<br>
it be *any* doctor, including one who is him/herself
<br>
transgender?  Or what about a case like my cousin, born
<br>
ambiguously gender raised male, who married an ambiguous
<br>
gender raised female?  And what if a transgender male to
<br>
female wishes to marry a transgender female to male?  Would
<br>
they not be a legitimate hetero marriage either way?
<br>
<p>It will bring me much joy and laughter to read the body of law
<br>
thus derived by some of those stodgy conservative southern
<br>
states trying to grapple with these issues.  Perhaps most
<br>
states simply say eventually: marry whomever you want,
<br>
with our unconditional blessing.
