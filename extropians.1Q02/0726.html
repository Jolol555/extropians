<p>Review sources, presumably lots on the net now, carefully.
<br>
Most dietary sources of Q10 are in non-plant food sources.
<br>
&quot;Muscle&quot; contains a lot of Q10.  If you don't eat much of it
<br>
then you should supplement.  Additionally if one is on cholesterol
<br>
inhibiting medication and its one of the drugs designed to inhibit
<br>
the HMG-CoA-reductase enzyme (many &quot;statins&quot;), that is going to
<br>
decrease your endogenous Q10 production (both cholesteral and
<br>
Q10 synthesis are downstream from that enzyme).
<br>
<p>It is probably going to be difficult to get the dose right
<br>
calculating from first principles (diet, weight, etc.).
<br>
Better in the long run is to have tests done and try to
<br>
maintain your Q10 level at the mid-high end of &quot;normal&quot;.
<br>
<p>Note -- the side effect of Q10 quenching superoxide (this needs
<br>
to be researched more(!)) would be to diminish uncoupling meaning
<br>
potentially your temperature should run low and/or your weight could
<br>
increase.  But all this fits in nicely with the CR model --
<br>
low glucose levels means a low flux through the mitochondrial
<br>
electron transport chain means it never gets &quot;backed up&quot; generating
<br>
superoxide in the first place.
<br>
<p>I'd say place your emphasis on keeping your glucose levels as low
<br>
as you feel comfortable without feeling lethargic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have you considered moderating an ExI NodeNet forum on life extension....?
</em><br>
<p>Can't.  Keeping up with this stuff would be a full time job.
<br>
I'm getting one of those trying to put us in the position of
<br>
engineering better solutions to these problems.  Trying to extend
<br>
lifespan with diet is like trying to thread a needle while wearing
<br>
oven mitts.
