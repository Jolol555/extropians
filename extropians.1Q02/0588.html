</em><br>
<em>&gt; My favorite paradigm is Neal Stephanson's &quot;Diamond Age&quot; or &quot;A young

<em>&gt; Ladies Illustrated Primer&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>It is the holy grail: adaptive to near AI levels, able to determine
<br>
suitable information and equipped with a huge knowledge base. Of course,
<br>
it is also entirely imaginary, so Stephenson could make it work
<br>
wonderfully with an authorial fiat. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if instead of waiting for the hardware, we were to attempt to

</em><br>
<p>Yes, this would be a good start. Even a sufficiently good prototype
<br>
would be useful, since it could be used to demonstrate the concept and
<br>
get many relief and educational organisations involved in the
<br>
development and application.
<br>
<p>The problem is to find a suitable education domain - a real Primer would
<br>
be too hard, but a too specialized version would be less interesting.
<br>
One possibility would be simple read/write/computer skills, which would
<br>
both be necessary as a basis for more ambitious systems and a good
<br>
standalone introductory system (and if it could provide enough skills to
<br>
use the WWW, it might simply point further and enable more individual
<br>
exploration).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The initial version could be in english, but readily translatable.
</em><br>
<p>This is an important point. Language barriers are powerful, and easily
<br>
missed when one is multilingual or used to always speaking english. 
<br>
<p>The wikipedia reference suggests that beside WWW, it might be
<br>
interesting to look for other networked systems such as P2P for ideas. I
<br>
got very inspired this morning by readinf part 2 of the E-sheep cartoon
<br>
&quot;The Spiders&quot; (<a href="http://www.e-sheep.com/spiders/">http://www.e-sheep.com/spiders/</a>) where a very suggestive
<br>
idea was introduced (but the author skirts the messy translation issue).
