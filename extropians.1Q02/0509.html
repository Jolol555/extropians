<em>&gt; Ok, lets for the sake of the discussion assume every human

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Every human being _is_ granted these rights. That's what the declaration 
<br>
says. Unfortunately, too many people manage to deprive others of their 
<br>
rights without being held responsible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its a fundamental question -- when do &quot;fundamental&quot; human rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trump property rights?  One almost has to laugh at Fukuyama arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for human &quot;dignity&quot; and preventing human cloning when 20 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people a year die of hunger and starvation.  Or probably more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who will die from HIV infections.  Lets address the *real* problems.
</em><br>
<p>The problems you mention are mostly questions of fair distribution of 
<br>
existing material. &quot;We&quot; (meaning all humans) can easily produce enough food 
<br>
and vaccine to prevent the death of the over 40,000 children per day for 
<br>
example. But there's is not enough monetary profit in it. We could easily 
<br>
provide enough teachers to eradicate illiteracy. But the ROI would come in 
<br>
a decade or so. Too long to explain this to shareholders. And the 1st world 
<br>
would long have a real cure for HIV/AIDS, if the possible profit would be 
<br>
big enough (compared to the profit they currently make) and/or their own 
<br>
survival would be at stake.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *Or* will society become stale and lethargic when people are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer motivated by the needs of survival?
</em><br>
<p>*thinking of our decadent 1st world* yepp. At least most of us. From my 
<br>
POV, the &quot;race to the moon&quot; was the last project that really motivated 
<br>
millions, because the success had been coupled with political survival, 
<br>
while the practical use of it (for the average citizen) was almost zero.
<br>
<p>A new project like that could give this planet a real boost, but I have no 
<br>
idea what it could be. In our present situation, the first questions are 
<br>
always &quot;what personal profit do I get from it?&quot;, &quot;how much does it cost? 
<br>
(what do I have to sacrifice for it)&quot; and &quot;is it safe?&quot;.
