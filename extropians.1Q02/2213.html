Man Who Would Be God: Giving Robots Life
<br>
<p>By SARAH LYALL
<br>
<p>HIPHAM, England - Steve Grand, maverick artificial-life expert and 
<br>
designer of the breathtakingly innovative computer game Creatures, is 
<br>
not one to shrink from brazen pronouncements. &quot;I am an aspiring 
<br>
latter-day Baron Frankenstein,&quot; is how Mr. Grand describes himself in 
<br>
his recent book, &quot;Creation: Life and How to Make It&quot; (Harvard 
<br>
University Press, $26).
<br>
<p>He makes an even bolder claim for Creatures, in which he created a 
<br>
new race of cyberanimals who can learn, adapt and evolve in ways that 
<br>
have proved surprising even to him.
<br>
<p>&quot;A game it might have been, but if you'll forgive the staggering lack 
<br>
of modesty this implies, Creatures was probably the closest thing 
<br>
there has been to a new form of life on this planet in four billion 
<br>
years,&quot; Mr. Grand writes. &quot;These creatures probably still represent 
<br>
the state of the art in synthetic life forms.&quot;
<br>
<p>He is now trying to surpass himself by searching for the Holy Grail 
<br>
of artificial intelligence, a way to build a robot that thinks, feels 
<br>
and learns. He has stiff competition from other labs around the 
<br>
world, but among those who are rooting for him is the biologist 
<br>
Richard Dawkins.
<br>
<p>&quot;Steve Grand is the creator of what I think is the nearest approach 
<br>
to artificial life so far,&quot; Mr. Dawkins has said. Speaking of Mr. 
<br>
Grand's latest endeavor, what is known as the Lucy project, he told 
<br>
The Sunday Times: &quot;With his record, if anyone could pull off such a 
<br>
spectacular coup, it would be him.&quot;
