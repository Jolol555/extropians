</em><br>
<p>One could argue that the virtual nation is (c). The only way, IMHO, to
<br>
change society via (c) is to amass enough economic clout to make existing
<br>
portions of society listen. Anything else is wishful thinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Assumption #1: there's no better way to start a nation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with an MMORPG.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huh?  Don't grok &quot;MMORPG&quot;.  The holy google leads me to think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has something to do with the gaming universe.  But I am not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dweller in that space so I am not sure what it is about.
</em><br>
<p>Massive(ly) multiplayer online role-playing game. For suitable definitions
<br>
of &quot;massive&quot;, &quot;multiplayer&quot;, &quot;online&quot; and &quot;role-playing&quot;, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is this what you meant by &quot;virtual&quot;?  I more have in mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building alternate secure, trusted, private communication,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and processing pools, economics, trade and so on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; online outside of the prying eyes and disasterous laws and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics of the every day meat space and its mirroring on the Net.
</em><br>
<p>That too, but you'll notice while many advocate this, no-one has a working
<br>
network/culture with more than 10k people in it. Compare with virtual
<br>
nations that exist in games: 10k people is pocket change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'll take this as read, but convince yourself of this if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed. My thesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; here is you need a fairly large number of potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right-minded people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and you aren't going to get a sufficient number who can be swayed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; participating in nationhood any other way. There is only one online
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pseudo/proto-nation of any note; Everquest [www.everquest.com].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must be kidding.  Everquest is a stupid addictive mind-fuck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game that has absorbed some of my friends and kept them from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing anything productive for quite some time now.  Please say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are kidding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not a player but the space is much too limited and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constrained to be a real viable internet community, much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the framework for a new civlization.  Bad drugs.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, not kidding. Put it this way: if 30-50% of your social interaction
<br>
time happens in place X, and there are 300,000 (or even a few thousand)
<br>
other people who say the same, I think you're going to have to start
<br>
redefining words in order to deny that place X is not the center of a
<br>
community.
<br>
<p>I would note that EQ can be a &quot;stupid addictive mind-fuck game&quot; while also
<br>
being everything I say it is. &quot;stupid addictive mind-fuck game&quot; pretty much
<br>
describes most people's experience with their meat lives too.
<br>
<p>Productive is as productive does. Any successful/skilled EQ player can
<br>
convert their EQ work time (i.e. time spent accumulating platinum, items,
<br>
leveling, etc) to meat world money quite efficiently, thank you, thanks to
<br>
black markets. There are real world groups that make a living doing just
<br>
this; one of them is sueing the makers of Dark Age of Camelot right now to
<br>
prevent them banning such trades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; designed to be one; it's the natural end result of a critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; playing a crude escapist simulation of real life. It's an unrecognized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dictatorship with many part-time residents from real-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations who trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Everquest intangibles on black markets in America and Europe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is in no way a simulation of &quot;real life&quot;.  It is a game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleverly designed to suck you in for more and more hours.
</em><br>
<p>Au contraire, it is absolutely a simulation of real life; specifically real
<br>
capitalist life. In order to get ahead in EQ, you have to be industrious.
<br>
You have to &quot;work&quot; -- perform tasks that are often repetitive and not
<br>
necessarily that interesting. Sometimes &quot;work&quot; is cool, like when you work
<br>
with your friends, or finish off a major task that gives you a sense of
<br>
satisfaction. Doing well allows you leisure time, spend chatting and
<br>
socializing, showing off whatever presige you earned in your work.
<br>
<p>If you play these games at all, you understand how they mimic real economic
<br>
life. People socialize, and then it's &quot;ok, back to work&quot; to power level,
<br>
find that next 100 platinum, etc.
<br>
<p>So really, mmorpgs like this are work holidays, I guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, I do agree that it is very interesting designing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing games to work out alternate ways of doing things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating value and so on.  And of course, &quot;real&quot; virtual worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where real value and living take place are very interesting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.  But game hollow substitutes to escape from reality and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feed people's addiction without really giving them any space to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create anything but more wealth for the designres and hosters of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the game is not the way to a viable future in my opinion.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we certainly may learn things there that are very important for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded/virtual life and for creating alternatives.
</em><br>
<p>You know, everything you're saying about these games applies to most
<br>
people's meatspace lives too...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have often wished that there was a way to have the gaming mania
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually solve real, important problems and create real value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That kind of dedication and fanaticism that I have seen in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the elite players could do wonders if it was channeled. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun to think of possible games where this might be more true.
</em><br>
<p>Well, gah, what am I proposing here, but to use gaming mania to solve a
<br>
real, important problem?
<br>
<p>The thesis of my post was that people can pontificate and design
<br>
bootstrapped virtual worlds all they like, and they'll be roundly ignored as
<br>
they have been for decades. They're ignoring the herd of elephants (virtual
<br>
proto-nations based on games) next door. MMORPGs will spawn real virtual
<br>
nations; it seems all but inevitable at this point. The only question will
<br>
be which direction will they head in?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So in theory, there's nothing stopping you making an MMORPG
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which guides and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rewards the formation of governing bodies of your choice, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fun to play. A libertarian twist on a traditional MMORPG, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because it is a game, it could garner a large and persistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; userbase/populance/part-time inhabitants within a few years. EverQuest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; boasts 300,000 subscribers, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  But you have to allow a lot of freedom, at least as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as in the real-world, to have a true virtual society/world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolve.  You need a set of basic &quot;physical&quot; laws and a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints on the inhabitants.  You also need that world to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken seriously and have serious potential for real gain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loss and the creation of real value.  It needs more than to just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be &quot;fun&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>No you don't, no it doesn't. People build complex communities with intricate
<br>
rituals, histories and mores on FPS shooter servers, you know, let alone in
<br>
MMORPGs.
<br>
<p>I'd suggest you bite the bullet and dive in and play some of these games for
<br>
a little while. Do some research. If you think that people don't take these
<br>
game worlds seriously, that the level of rules and laws are inconsistant
<br>
with real societies, then you definately need to go look at the communities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A problem with existing MMORPGs for virtual nation building is their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; centralization. Too easy to shut down by a physical world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation state that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wanted to nip this thing in the bud. It's hard to wield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic clout if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you have servers that can be shut down easily. One would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; next logical step and build an MMORPG around a decentralized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer-to-peer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system. This would probably have to be built on top of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; model internet-scale operating system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1133">http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1133</a>].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A decentralized peer-to-peer system has its own many problems of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course.  Much of a virtual state would require massive amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of storage of computational state.  Decentralizing that and yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping its coherency would require much cleverness and a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundancy.
</em><br>
<p>All of which is currently researched, white papered, planned, theorized,
<br>
outlined, and in some cases actually prototyped. Go research.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For some types of such worlds really meaty server
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines are essential for many lesser classes of machine's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owners to play at all.  The servers do not have to be stationary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in meat or internet space of course, but they do have to exist.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. Meaty server machines can be emulated in some classes of
<br>
decentralized system. Again, go research.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Some stationary servers could also be in secret, hardened,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to stop, locations.  Perhaps you could even have such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thing claim the privileges granted to a religion and religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community.
</em><br>
<p>When you start talking about macroeconomics; i.e. virtual nation with
<br>
serious economic clout talking turkey with real nation with serious economic
<br>
clout, large servers in any location are vulnerable to shutdown via any
<br>
number of means. An inconvenienced real nation will take that course because
<br>
it is cheaper than the alternatives. Look at RIAA vrs file trading networks
<br>
for the economic realities underlying this sort of decision tree. Morality
<br>
and ethics don't really come into it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Existing scalable peer-to-peer structures in development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/17/0530222&amp;mode=thread">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/17/0530222&amp;mode=thread</a>uld
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably suffice on their own if they weren't just regarded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a service.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Big difference between something that's a service (Napster,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gnutella) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something that is, in effect, a second home (MMORPG).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and a part of the difference is a  difference in bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and concentrated computational resource needs.
</em><br>
<p>Not really. If anything, an MMORPG client takes up less bandwidth than
<br>
streaming audio.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Although the line between the two paragraphs above is pretty blurry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyhow, so lets say you have your ultra-cool, libertarian-leaning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; player-run MMORPG with 300,000 players based on the next Gnutella as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; platform. Or freenet. Or whatever. And this will happen; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be libertarian-leaning, but we'll have an ultra-cool player-run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MMORPG with at least 300k players on a decentralized peer-to-peer platform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; five years from now, I figure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we don't have a hell of a lot more than that in five years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I don't like the odds for freedom enough to reach Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>It takes two years to roll out a decent product in the corporate software
<br>
world. That's unlikely to change before the end of the decade, if then. It's
<br>
a management process thing.
<br>
<p>So, two years for the decentralized internet operating system thingy (which
<br>
will be simulateously brought out by Microsoft as a .NET extension, and by
<br>
Sun+other companies as a set of extension APIs to the Java standards), and
<br>
then two years after that the first large professionally-produced games
<br>
based on it.
<br>
<p>I've always said you singularitarians have your clocks wound too tight.
<br>
Barring someone getting lucky with a hard takeoff, society as a whole isn't
<br>
going to roll out a singularity within the next ten to twenty years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So at that point, you have the real seed for a true virtual nation, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which could start to try for recognition by real nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leverage and the traditional routes of extablishing exchange rates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legitimizing existing black and gray markets, etc, etc. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this could head to a nice place to live a whole lot faster than building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your own island or getting out of the gravity well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You need real goods beyond entertainment items that are produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the VR and real goods that flow in the reverse direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you are going to effectively create a new kind of society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtual space.
</em><br>
<p>Why would this be? Have you checked the internation money flows for
<br>
tangibles vrs intangibles recently?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The current e-commerce might move into such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; v-world in a big way.  Major data storage and representation, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least of some types, might turn out to be a natural.  But if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pull in real commerce from outside then outside laws and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions and politics come with it.  So this might not be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine idea even if viable.  You need things that are produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally most competitively in such a space that are seen as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value outside.
</em><br>
<p>Entertainment. Artificially created rare intangibles (the present MMORPG and
<br>
other collectable markets). Access. Processor time. Services (guides,
<br>
trainers, etc).
<br>
<p>Restrictions and politics always come with it; that's why you need economic
<br>
muscle to defend against them.
<br>
<p>---&gt; the animated silicon love doll
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;So at that point, you have the real seed for a true virtual nation, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which could start to try for recognition by real nations through economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;leverage and the traditional routes of extablishing exchange rates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;legitimizing existing black and gray markets, etc, etc. It seems to me
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;this could head to a nice place to live a whole lot faster than building
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;your own island or getting out of the gravity well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do we export? How would the being a citizen of this virtual nation
</em><br>
work? Would it be my house/apartment
<br>
<em>&gt;seceding from the US (or wherever)? How would that work if I was renting my
</em><br>
home, or living with my parents (as
<br>
<em>&gt;I do)?
</em><br>
<p>You get whatever the virtual nation can muscle out of existing nations via
<br>
simply having stuff to trade. Dual citizenship, preferential treatment,
<br>
access to money markets. Like being an ex-pat. As soon as sufficient flow
<br>
across borders exists, money changers spring up. So get paid in virtual
<br>
currency, avoid real nation income taxes, use money changers.
<br>
<p>I can see income taxes being the first line of battle, actually. If you have
<br>
a significant body of people productively working in a virtual nation and
<br>
not paying much in the way of income taxes to the real nation, that's going
<br>
to put noses out of joint.
