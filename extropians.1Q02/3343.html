<p>1000 people/km^2 does only sound not overpopulated if you're talking about

ambulatory trees.

<p>You have to allow them to locomote. To supply them with energy, and a

survivable pollution density. Food and water, yes, equally canalization,

and waste disposal. Material and energy fluxes in general, including
<br>
people themselves (typically in &quot;car&quot; packages).

<p>Population density of 1000 people/km^2 is not possible at current level of
<br>
technology. Dramatic change in lifestyle, routing mesh traffic and
<br>
delivery system, telepresence, photovoltaics, fuel cell, closed loop
<br>
ecosystems, symbionts and nanotechnology could eventually allow higher
<br>
densities. But, clearly, the best solution would seem to get people off
<br>
the substrate and offplanet.

<p><em>&gt; (Drinking water's actually easy to get from rainfall, even in really dry

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>A bipedal primate for itself only burns few 100 W, and has negligable
<br>
material flux in terms of kg/h. A faux reality solution suggests itself.
