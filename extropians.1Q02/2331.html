<em>&gt;&gt;You know what is the strangest thing? The people who foam most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;strongly at  the mouth when screeching about the evils of society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are those who have benefitted most from it. Those who have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;born into the richer classes, who have gained their wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;knowledge from countless generations before them, demand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they alone be recognised as being the creators of their good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;fortune and that they are damned if they will share it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;anybody else.
</em><br>
<p>Your statement includes inaccuracies. The majority of well to do
<br>
individuals in the U.S. earned it themselves in a single generation
<br>
as research on millionares by Thomas Stanley makes clear.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I believe that this is because they have the mistaken belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life is a zero-sum game.  They cannot conceive of the poor getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more money without them losing theirs.
</em><br>
<p>I'm guessing that you are refering to the specific group that
<br>
Miriam is refering to (greedy rich people) rather than those who
<br>
are financially well off.
<br>
<p>Government policy in this country treats wealth as a zero sum game.
<br>
<p>In this country it is the (social) democrats who argue over who
<br>
gets how big a slice of pie, and the republicians who say that what
<br>
we really need are more/bigger pies.
