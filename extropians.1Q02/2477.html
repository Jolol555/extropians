<em>&gt;I agree.  But having closed source guarantees that interested parties cannot
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;verifying security, and they end up having to assume or trust the vendor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with no evidence of security.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;A vendor can offer compelling evidence of security by promising to pay,
<br>
say, $100,000 to anyone who demonstrates the existence of a security flaw
<br>
in their software. If consumers refused to buy closed-source software that
<br>
wasn't backed by such evidence, I suspect it would quickly become obvious
<br>
that closed-source software has been insecure because of inadequate
<br>
motivation, rather than due to any inherent limitation of the closed-source
<br>
approach.
<br>
&nbsp;Oddly enough, the only software I'm aware of that is backed by such an
<br>
offer is qmail, an open-source program (<a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html">http://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html</a>).
<br>
Last I checked, the typical Linux distribution installed sendmail rather than
<br>
qmail by default. Given sendmail's less than exemplary security record, it is
<br>
hard to say that security is a terribly high priority in much of the
<br>
open-source world.
