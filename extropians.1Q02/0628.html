<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;The Spirit is willing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the flesh is weak&quot; to Russian by a translation machine.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result supposedly came out to something like, &quot;The Vodka is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the meat is rotten.&quot;...&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<p>Things have gotten better.  See <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr">http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr</a>
<br>
<p>Here's an idea.  The software based translators certainly have
<br>
their weaknesses, one of which is that they do not deal well
<br>
with common expressions and phrases, such as the spirit is
<br>
willing but the flesh is weak.
<br>
<p>Suppose we had a list of special cases that the software
<br>
would look for in common speech, then translate as special
<br>
cases.  A few examples I can think of would be
<br>
<p>&quot;...six of one, half dozen of the other&quot; = identical.
<br>
&quot;...wassup?&quot; = hello
<br>
&quot;...have a nice day&quot; = goodbye, get outta my face, etc.
<br>
<p>Computers are now fast enough to tear thru a jillion of these
<br>
kinds of special phrases that might trip up the literal translators.
<br>
In common English speech, for instance, a computer translation
<br>
might puzzle a foreign language speaker if the program did
<br>
not understand the several different meanings of the term
<br>
&quot;fucking,&quot; depending on it's position in the sentence.
<br>
<p>When used before a verb, it is translated &quot;with enthusiasm.&quot;
<br>
When used before a noun, it is translated &quot;undesireable.&quot;
<br>
When used before an adjective, it is translated &quot;extremely.&quot;
<br>
When used before a period, comma or pronoun, it is translated
<br>
&quot;in the process of copulating.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are likely plenty of better examples, but our brains
<br>
somehow figure out what speech means, so it seems we
<br>
can put comparable or perhaps better speech interpretation
<br>
mechanisms into software.  spike
