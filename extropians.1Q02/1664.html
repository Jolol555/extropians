<p>The other possibility that seems quite defensible is to get the life insurance
<br>
contract now, and sign up when the technology looks believable to you.  The
<br>
younger you are, the cheaper the life insurance is, and the sooner you start
<br>
paying in, the sooner you have an asset to pay off your contract with.
<br>
<p>Of course, once you have a life insurance contract you might as well sign up
<br>
with Alcor (or your choice of alternatives).  The insurance contract is the
<br>
big part of the price, and once you're paying toward that, it'll seem like it
<br>
would be a shame to die and not take advantage of whatever chances you have
<br>
with current technology.
<br>
<p>If you wait, you'll have to pay much closer to the full $X00,000.

<p>Every insurance company will sell you an appropriate policy.  It's called
<br>
&quot;Whole Life&quot;.  It means you own an asset once you've paid in.  I think the
<br>
main alternative in the insurance biz is called &quot;Term Life&quot;.  In that case,
<br>
you are only promised a benefit if you die during the term of the contract. 
<br>
If you outlive the contract, all your money is gone.  
<br>
<p>There seems to be a claim that some insurance companies have contested
<br>
payments to cryonics organizations in the past because the organization has an
<br>
interest in your death or some such.  Apparently because of that, many Alcor
<br>
members seem to swear by one particular insurance company, which has
<br>
consistently paid off claims by Alcor.  I don't remember their name.  I have
<br>
my insurance with USAA Life.  USAA always comes out in the top three of all US
<br>
insurance companies in every survey I've ever seen.

      &quot;A sense of age, of profound truths.  Respect for something hands
      made, that's stood through storms and wars and time.  It 
      persuades us that things we do may last and matter.&quot;
