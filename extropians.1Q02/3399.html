A way for us to be more extropian/post-human is to develop
<br>
a philosophy that overcomes all others. MVT continues 
<br>
to strengthen as more evidence is found. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Knowledge gives us access to more &amp; better altered 
<br>
states. The winning argument will exert, historically, the
<br>
greatest influence (or be the most powerful meme).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Implanting in memory is just one step.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The most powerful meme/ argument, at least in the 
<br>
longer term, is that which is &quot;true&quot; - - or least variant
<br>
from the natural reality or state of the world in itself.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We should aim for &quot;proof positive&quot; and killer applications.
<br>
Demonstrations matter more than words. The academic
<br>
school of &quot;Philosophy&quot;, founded by Plato, is irrelevent. We
<br>
should close the University ghettos and turn the school-men
<br>
out into the streets. Philosophers belong in the community.
<br>
Socrates lived his philosophy &amp; was greater than his pupil.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It is important to innoculate the populations against the two
<br>
wide-spreading virus memes: Supernaturalism (Islam , Xianity &amp;c), 
<br>
and Materialism. This is because the populations 
<br>
(of humanoids) are potential posthumans/ more-than-humans
<br>
and these viruses &amp; delusional systems are a waste of life force. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Persuasion &amp; appeal to self-interest is more efficient than
<br>
confrontation &amp; attempted refutations of irrational belief systems.
<br>
Invite the delusionists &amp; theologians adherent to the old ways
<br>
to break themselves on the irrefutable Median Vision Theory.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Rather than trying to hypnotise &amp; fool humanoids, my aim as
<br>
a therapist is to draw humanoids out of trance,  wakefullness.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But a deeper &amp; more relaxing sleep is sometimes a
<br>
prerequisite &amp; initial trance deepening or direction change
<br>
is needed. This varies between individuals.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
By throwing more light we also cast more shadows. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What does it mean to be post-human unless we excel 
<br>
individually? Understanding mentation makes it easy.
