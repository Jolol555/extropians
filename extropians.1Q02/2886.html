<p>That's outrageous! They're probably susceptible to out-of-spec
<br>
voltages/currents and can be damaged with even a light hammer

blow. Damn those penny pinching bastards.

<p>Seriously, though, Intel chips don't have built-in fuses, they rely on
<br>
the mainboard or power supply to not fry them. Does this cost Intel
<br>
credibility? This is pretty obvious FUD from Intel.
