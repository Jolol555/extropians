</em><br>
<p>Once, again, you apparently did NOT read my prior posts on this thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. I am asking you to incriminate yourself ? I was not aware of it. I happen
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just because I am asking you something which you wouldn't want to be known,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not imply that I am 'asking you to incriminate yourself'. Why are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling attacked ? Why leave it at that ?
</em><br>
<p>If you were not aware, use of marijuana, cocaine, exctasy, heroine, PCP,
<br>
methamphetamines, or anything other than caffeine, alcohol, and
<br>
nicotine, are generally quite illegal activities. As this is a public
<br>
forum, asking me to admit participating in illegal activities is asking
<br>
me to incriminate myself in a manner which is considered admissable
<br>
evidence in court.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I really read all your previous posts in this thread and I still do not know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what exact experiences gave you the knowledge which you seem to have. I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concrete stuff, examples, something that can widen my map. Something I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grind on. Is that wrong ?
</em><br>
<p>While I can understand that since you are not a native english speaker
<br>
you might not have completely comprehended my prior statements, further
<br>
detailing them or elaborating on them would result in my incriminating
<br>
myself.
<br>
<p>Be that as it may, when your mother told you it was a very stupid thing
<br>
to jump off a cliff, did you doubt her word, even if she had never
<br>
jumped off a cliff before in her life?
