Suicide is not the norm in the biological world. Postbiological world

still shares the core properties of an ecology, is derived from an ecology

<p>It is not obvious how warfare within the computronium node cloud or

It seems the logistics would favour the local party, putting the intruder

at disadvantage. Use of high energy weapons within the cloud would
<br>
probably annoy the neighbours, too.

<p><em>&gt; That means in the final ultra-long term future, SIs don't consume

<p>The omega biota looks indeed rather degenerate, with only minor, random

fitness fluctuations over time over space.

<p><em>&gt; True.  I suppose I would have to see some concrete plans for how to

are relatively manageable, if you use their Hawking output and asymmetric

<p><em>&gt; energy comes out as gamma and X-rays then it seems to be a pretty

<p>You would want to attenuate the accretion disk radiation of large holes by

an artifical atmophere and/or dust cloud around them.

<p>Yes. Right now, we're only guessing.
