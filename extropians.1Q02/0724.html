From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Scientific%20method%20=%20device%20for%20accurately%20identifying%20incorrect%20thinking?">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Scientific method = device for accurately identifying incorrect thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is another thread, but I would like to point out that 1) whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is universally accurate is strongly debated
</em><br>
<p>I'd say &quot;weakly&quot; debated rather than &quot;strongly&quot; -- and add that the debate
<br>
hasn't produced anything nearly as useful as what science has produced. When a
<br>
device for accurately identifying incorrect thinking surpasses the ability of
<br>
the scientific method to do so, we can measure the extent of its success by
<br>
using the scientific method.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) it is not applicable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all situations
</em><br>
<p>In those situations where accuracy is unwelcome, the scientific method may
<br>
seem not to apply, but this is because people often prefer to remain immured
<br>
in their familiar fantasies rather than liberated by unfamiliar facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) it is not very efficient in dealing with qualitative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data.
</em><br>
<p>The scientific method begins with categorizing knowledge, which makes it the
<br>
most efficient method for dealing with qualitative data. What is qualitative
<br>
data? Quality is a measure of relative value. Qualitative data deals with
<br>
meanings. &quot;Is this movie interesting?&quot;
<br>
Qualitative data is varied in nature. It includes any information that can be
<br>
captured that is not numerical in nature. Consequently, according to the
<br>
scientific method, the assignment of categories of correctness or
<br>
incorrectness to thinking which pertains to qualitative data would be
<br>
incorrect.
<br>
&lt;ta-dah&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an example, how do you apply science to accurately identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the claim &quot;Captain Ahab was gay&quot; is an incorrect conclusion from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; melville's _Moby Dick_?
</em><br>
<p>That's easy. Captain Ahab never existed, therefore his sexuality did not exist
<br>
either.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
