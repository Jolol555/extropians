<em>&gt; &gt;The &quot;Complex large scale political organization&quot;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Running an empire the length of the Andes under a nigh-communistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime requires a lot of organization.  Several Andean civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had built large-scale irrigation works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;They had not invented the wheel for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transportation (something that the barbaric tribes of the eurasian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;steppes had had for thousands of years prior).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Precisely.  Barbarians can have the wheel, and civilizations can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack them.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no. The American native 'civilizations' are the only examples of
<br>
such which never developed the wheel. Why? You could say because their
<br>
ancestors were stupid and exterminated useful animal species rather than
<br>
domesticated them, but the Incas did domesticate the llama, and the very
<br>
IDEA of the wheel, it seems, was not alien to the Inca, they just
<br>
prohibited it as an instrument of blasphemy.
<br>
<p>Every Old World civilization had the wheel, sophisticated written
<br>
language, inter-civilizational trade, true large cities (i.e. over
<br>
100,000 pop), and could support the organization of disciplined and
<br>
professional martial classes (rather than just a bunch of bullies who
<br>
hoot and charge madly into battle).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Their 'cities' were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nothing more than large religious complexes surrounded by several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;villages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their cities were more than a &quot;couple of villages&quot;.  Cuzco had over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10,000.
</em><br>
<p>You prove my point. 10k people is nothing but a small town. The capital
<br>
cities of true civilizations that were far more ancient (i.e. Cuzco had
<br>
10k in 1500 AD, while Babylon had 250,000 in 1500 BC) were a few orders
<br>
of magnitude larger.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and they had no metals technology beyond working with gold,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;copper, and in a few cases, bronze. Iron technology was just beginning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to be experimented with by a few Toltec tribes at the time of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Conquistadors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which makes them equivalent to Egypt around 1400 BC.  Hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncivilized.
</em><br>
<p>The Aztecs, the dominant civilization in the area, along with the
<br>
earlier mayan and toltec tribes can aspire to the status of
<br>
civilization, because they specifically DID have written languages. My
<br>
original point, though, is that they did not achieve that level until
<br>
thousands of years AFTER the western, and even the eastern civilizations
<br>
had. The oldest new world civilization we know of is that of the Olmecs,
<br>
who lived in the same Yucatan/Honduras area, and which existed as far
<br>
back as 1500 BC, but were little more than a group of jaguar worshipping
<br>
cannibals who were fair stonecutters for a stone age culture.
