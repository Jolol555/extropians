</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yes, i assume for isolating ribosomes, you'd want tens of thousands of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ROTFL.  Boy that is a throwback approach, but it would probably work.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; g) Hood: $3000+

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is RNA and DNA contamination.  You (and all the microorganisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the air) are leaving traces all over the place.  If you want good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results you are going to need to avoid contamination.  You might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to get away with a hand constructed one, a blower and a UV lamp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in it for sterilization when you aren't using it.
</em><br>
<p><p>shade-tree inventing-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a vertical-axis lathe a few years ago to produce composite molds for one part of a project (an electric ducted-fan camera
<br>
platform). The molds were for prototypes that would be part of an evolving design. A horizontal gap-bed lathe with a 24&quot; swing would
<br>
have worked just fine, but these cost $thousands even used, in addition to locating, moving, tooling, and set up. To job this out
<br>
would have meant either a) contracting the molds at untold $thousands or b) many $hundreds and many trips back and forth to the
<br>
machine shop.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design revolves around a car wheel and a bicyle wheel driven by a belt. The car wheel was scrounged from a late-model
<br>
something at a junkyard. I wasn't able to check for bearing runout at the yard, so for $20.00 I bought it and hoped. The belt was
<br>
the only other thing I had to locate (the motor, step-pulley, etc. were laying around), as it is over 60&quot; long. The wheel and motor
<br>
bracket were mounted on a scrap I-beam, with the bicycle wheel on top of the car wheel (I was in a hurry). It lit up first time, and
<br>
with care can I can make 4' diameter objects to about 10-thousandths- good enough for the ap. Total cost ~$50.00 and a day's work.
<br>
There was a shed roof over it that keep the leaves off.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A centrifuge is practically the same thing, RPM and radius can be traded off.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the stuff on this list can be fabbed in a similar manner. Used restaurant equipment yards have stainless steel ovens and
<br>
proofing boxes that can be used for the incubator and sterilizing oven. The (restaurant) hood can be tigged up for a glove box
<br>
(maybe using marine fittings), SS counters and sinks can be had for pretty cheap. PCR is an exercise in Mondotronics. Maybe the -80
<br>
deg cooler can be a reverse-cycle argon or nitrogen-charged Stirling made from a car engine, using a standard freezer coil for
<br>
pre-cooling? CO2 monitors and metering valves would probably have to be store-bought. I don't know about the water, it depends on
<br>
the capacity and purity.
