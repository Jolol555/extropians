</em><br>
<p>Uh, most emphatically NO, most scientists are not agreed, at least in
<br>
the way you mean. In fact, the majority do not agree that there is a
<br>
significant anthropogenic warming trend. ALL scientists do agree that
<br>
&quot;we are undergoing climate change&quot;, but that is a semantically neutral
<br>
statement which only recognises that the world climate is not a stasis,
<br>
it is a dynamic system with a myriad of inputs and outputs that change
<br>
over time. Saying that &quot;we are undergoing climate change&quot; is true even
<br>
if that climate change is that we are going into an ice age. Even if
<br>
part of the world is getting cooler and part getting warmer, to sum out
<br>
to zero, this still means that &quot;we are undergoing climate change&quot;.
<br>
<p>The reason why there is so much doubt about warming, and anthropogenic
<br>
warming in particular, is that the period of data collection is so very
<br>
short for those claiming that there is catastrophic change happening,
<br>
generally only a 30-100 year period. Longer range studies, based on
<br>
things like tree rings and ice cores, show that climatic change does
<br>
not, in fact, happen, to the degree claimed by proponents of big
<br>
government taxes on energy and everything else, nor do ice ages start in
<br>
as little as a decade (or stop).
<br>
<p>For example, the oceans rose approximately 400 feet over 1000 years
<br>
during the end of the last ice age, around 9000 BC, but it wasn't until
<br>
5600 BC that sea levels got high enough to breach the Bosporus and
<br>
Dardanelles to flood the Black Sea basin, whose freshwater surface was
<br>
some 135 feet below sea level.
<br>
<p>The antarctic ice cap, for instance, has been completely stable, and
<br>
growing slowly over the long term, for the past 15 million years or so,
<br>
ever since Antarctica broke away from South America and the circum polar
<br>
ocean current became permanently established. This is a known fact that
<br>
the cataclysmists have had to recently concede in the scientific world,
<br>
but the media has refused to acknowledge this major setback for the
<br>
big-government/tax-everything-to-pay-for-climate-control agenda. The
<br>
human race will never be flooded with 90 meters of seawater worldwide
<br>
from an antarctic collapse. At worst, we may see a 3-9 meter change in
<br>
sea level IF the Greenland Ice Cap collapses, however doing things like
<br>
flooding the Caspian basin will mitigate this to a large degree, as will
<br>
the growth of the Antarctic Ice Cap created by increases in evaportion
<br>
at the equator.
<br>
<p>The melting of the arctic ice sheet will not change ocean levels even
<br>
while the climate changes, since the ice is already floating. What will
<br>
happen is the increase in open ocean in the arctic will increase
<br>
evaporation and thus increase precipitation in Greenland, thus helping
<br>
to mitigate any increase in melting that occurs in the margins.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to see is if the media hype engine will rev up as high for

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; there be political movements urging us to hurl more greenhouse gases

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Excellent! I can see a wonderful spoof TV documentary right now. Seriously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even when there was a mini-panic about global cooling in the early 1970s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (remember &quot;The Weather Machine and the Threat of Ice&quot; ?) it never got the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coverage of global warming. I think it's obvious why - global warming can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be used to argue for lots of government controls and getting rid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology but you can't do that with cooling, quite the opposite in fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In fact as people like Matt Ridley have pointed out global cooling is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much more credible threat than global warming, given that the default
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; setting for the planet's climate right now is an ice age. Also, all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evidence suggests that the end of an interglacial and the onset of an ice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; age happens *very* quickly - less than ten years is the figure usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; given. Steve Davies
