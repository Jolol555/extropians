<p>Harvey, this area is getting even *more* complex than I want
<br>
to think about (unfortunately).  I too am a big fan of Q-10.
<br>
But, the article in the most recent Nature about superoxide
<br>
potentially regulating the uncoupling proteins makes me cautious.
<br>
<p>The mitochondria generate a hydrogen ion (H+) gradient by
<br>
pumping H+ ions out thru their membranes.  CoQ10 is
<br>
an essential factor in this process.  The H+ gradient is
<br>
used to generate ATP as the ions flow back through the
<br>
F0-F1-ATP synthase molecule.  This is a great strategy
<br>
because one is able to more closely couple a lot of
<br>
small energy carriers (the H+ gradient) to a large energy
<br>
carrier (ATP) [think converting cents into $] with few
<br>
losses.  In contrast when ATP (in $) is spent (by many
<br>
enzymes in the body) you may have the problem that everything
<br>
is priced in increments of $0.25 -- and because you
<br>
pay in ATP ($), the store keeps anything you over the
<br>
actual price (i.e. it doesn't &quot;make change&quot;).
<br>
<p>Now, as the H+ ion gradient gets steeper (lots of
<br>
inputs to generate it, or few ADP molecules to feed
<br>
the F0-F1-ATP synthase to run the gradient down) the
<br>
electron transport chain in the mitochondria gets backed up.
<br>
(View it as a queue waiting to get your oil changed.)
<br>
As that happens more free radicals (impatient customers)
<br>
get generated.
<br>
<p>As I've discussed before there are &quot;active&quot; mechanisms
<br>
for unleashing the UCP (uncoupling) proteins to run
<br>
down the H+ gradient and generate heat.  All warm-blooded
<br>
species use this to maintain body temperature.  When
<br>
your body &quot;feels&quot; that it is cold, hormones get released
<br>
to activate UCP proteins and generate heat.
<br>
<p>The recent Nature article *suggested* (the scientists
<br>
were clear to say more work was required to determine
<br>
whether this was an in vivo phenomena) that superoxide
<br>
also served to activate the UCP proteins.
<br>
<p>This makes a *lot* of sense -- if your H+ gradient gets
<br>
too high and is going to generate a lot of free radicals,
<br>
then the superoxide radical could serve as a fail-safe
<br>
molecule to activate the UCP proteins and reduce the
<br>
gradient to non-damaging levels.
<br>
<p>As I've mentioned before -- evidence suggests that CoQ10
<br>
is involved in both the electron transport chain to
<br>
generate the H+ gradient *as well as* the UCP protein
<br>
mediated process to diminish the H+ gradient.  So it
<br>
is an essential component of both charging and decharging
<br>
the gradient.
<br>
<p>Now, both of those mechanisms I have historically viewed
<br>
as &quot;good&quot;.  *BUT* if CoQ10 *also* serves as a general
<br>
antioxidant and can mitigate excess superoxide, then
<br>
it may serve to interfere with the normal processes
<br>
that use superoxide to activate the UCP proteins to
<br>
keep the H+ gradient below levels that generate
<br>
excessive quantities of free radicals.  In this
<br>
case excess CoQ10 (above that needed for the electron
<br>
transport chain and the UCP H+ ion transport) could
<br>
indeed be detrimental.
<br>
<p>I know -- it shocked me too!  It just goes to show how
<br>
there may be genetic programs that have been quite
<br>
well &quot;tuned&quot; and that tuning them with nutrients will
<br>
not work -- we have to get control of the program itself.
<br>
I won't go into the details but there are lots of things
<br>
one could do to leave the superoxide mediated effects
<br>
intact in the mitochondria while mitigating damage they
<br>
might cause elsewhere.
<br>
<p>Hope that provides some insight.  If you have more questions
<br>
email me directly so I'll know its something I should provide
<br>
greater detail on.
<br>
<p>Robert
