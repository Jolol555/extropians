<em>&gt; In *what* economy?  In a gift economy, any &quot;advantages&quot; of going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster are entirely derived from a self-created feeling that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like being appreciated by more people rather than fewer people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The entire concept of an &quot;economy&quot; breaks down when the doubling time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for our ability to manufacture things humans want exceeds the doubling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time of humans that want them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I'm lying in the sun, soaking up a few thousand watts, using my 9G
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wireless to immerse myself in the global matrix why should I care how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;fast&quot; I go?  I just pick a world that is running at the speed I choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run at.
</em><br>
<p>It is a complicated issue, how the economy will work in a future of
<br>
plenty.  I can't got into a lot of detail, but here are some reasons for
<br>
thinking that people will still engage in competitive economic behavior.
<br>
<p>First, today the average middle class Westerner is so much wealthier
<br>
than our cave-dwelling ancestors of 10000 years ago that the difference
<br>
is almost unmeasurable.  By the standards of that time, we have reached
<br>
a pinnacle beyond any possible dreams of wealth and gratification.
<br>
Yet people still want more.  Even if the future is far richer in
<br>
material goods than today, chances are the same effects will exist.
<br>
Expectations will rise to match production.
<br>
<p>Second, as you say the &quot;feeling of being appreciated&quot; is a significant
<br>
motivating factor.  I think that is what is underlying our quest for
<br>
advancement today.  We have an instinct for competition; we judge
<br>
ourselves by how well we are doing with respect to our neighbors.
<br>
We want to be admired and respected, to be accepted by those we admire.
<br>
All this motivates us to work and strive for success.
<br>
<p>Most people today could quit work and live on welfare more comfortably
<br>
than even a reasonably wealthy person from hundreds of years ago.  Yet
<br>
few people are willing to drop out.  Lying in the sun and doing nothing
<br>
will be no more attractive in the future than it is today, if it means
<br>
that you live a miserable life compared to your peers.
<br>
<p>Third, the &quot;gift economy&quot; is not a very well analyzed phenomenon.
<br>
It seems to me that even if we assume nanotech assemblers which produce
<br>
goods essentially for free (given matter and energy), you still have
<br>
the issue of designs.  Rich people will pay for designer originals
<br>
while the poor make do with generics.  Talented designers can get rich
<br>
creating one-off collectors' items which can be duplicated only crudely
<br>
by imitators.
<br>
<p>Compare a designer gown with the imitation you can find at Sears.
<br>
It's not the same.  There are tremendous differences in human abilities,
<br>
and some people will be able to make far higher quality designs than
<br>
others.  Their work will look right, it will feel right, it will have
<br>
style and class.
<br>
<p>You'll be able to get by on the freeware designs, but you won't feel proud
<br>
of them.  Again, your self esteem will depend on being successful, just
<br>
as is the case today.  Every time you have to download another piece of
<br>
crappy freeware you'll feel bad when you look at the catalog items you
<br>
have to pass by.
<br>
<p>Fourth, there are still going to be expenses.  One is energy.  Another is
<br>
matter.  Many people will prefer authentic living space to a holodeck,
<br>
so land will be valuable.  Someone who has a beautiful home with an
<br>
attractive view will be much more admired than someone who lives in
<br>
a cardboard shack in an alley, even if the interior of the shack is
<br>
indistinguishable from a palace.
<br>
<p>Energy isn't necessarily going to be cheap.  Whether it's solar or
<br>
anything else, supply and demand will set the price.  Rich people may
<br>
use far more energy than we can imagine today.  This could drive the
<br>
price out of reach of poor people.  Heat dissipation rights are another
<br>
potential cost where the rich could monopolize the resources, forcing
<br>
the poor to shut down their holodecks.
<br>
<p>Fifth, another form of expense comes in the form of services.  The gift
<br>
economy is mostly going to work with designs which, once created, can
<br>
be replicated millions of times over.  Services are by their nature
<br>
customized and individual.  They are going to be at least as expensive
<br>
as today.  Necessary services will include legal advice, fire prevention,
<br>
health care, and protection (police/military).  The world is an uncertain
<br>
place, and things always go wrong.  Conflicts arise; there are bad
<br>
people out there who will do you harm if you can't defend yourself.
<br>
All this will cost money.
<br>
<p>It's possible that the rich will be willing to subsidize some of these
<br>
costs for the poor, as they do today.  That's hard to predict.  But the
<br>
point is, people will still have expenses, and they will still be able
<br>
to improve the quality of their lives as well as their self esteem by
<br>
increasing their wealth.  Despite the astronomical increases in wealth
<br>
we have seen over the course of human history, at least in the West,
<br>
human motivations to work have not significantly decreased.  I don't
<br>
see a good reason for why this trend will change in the future.
