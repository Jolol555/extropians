<em>&gt; This is very interesting to me. I was previously aware of ceramic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rifle-stopper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plates in the front and back of level III-c vests, but I didn't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it was that effective. Do you know who produced those? They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prototype, I assume, as a google doesn't bring up anything like that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely...
</em><br>
<p><p>The ceramic plates flatten and fragment rifle bullets.  The slower and less
<br>
ballistically efficient shape post-ceramic is easily stopped by the vest
<br>
underneath.  
<br>
<p>Contrary to what Michael Lorrey stated, they will NOT stop AP (armor
<br>
penetrating) rifle bullets.  Part of the confusion is that marketing types
<br>
sell ammo as &quot;AP&quot; which was never designed as such by the military, but
<br>
which they can charge a premium for when selling to the gullible public.
<br>
This fake AP ammo can be stopped by armor vests.  Real AP has never been
<br>
available to the public and it is in fact illegal to own true AP ammo.  The
<br>
real clue that this is the case should be that the ATF does not crack down
<br>
on the myriad of &quot;AP&quot; ammo vendors.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyone know what kind of legislation governs the private production of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed energy weapons, hipower lasers, or directed emp weapons?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On a related note, does the legislation on automatic and explosive firearms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover privately developed, prototype, or handbuilt non-commercial weapons?
</em><br>
<p><p>The rules are complicated.  In the U.S., any weapon that doesn't require a
<br>
Form 4 transfer can legally be manufactured without licensing of any type as
<br>
long as you only do it for personal use and experimentation.  Building
<br>
restricted weapons requires a license called a Form 2 (IIRC), but once they
<br>
give it to you (and it is essentially a &quot;shall issue&quot; form) you can make
<br>
almost anything you want.  In conjunction with this, you would probably want
<br>
to fill out the form that gives you carte blanche to do anything you want
<br>
with explosives.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem you are likely to have is in the category of Form 4
<br>
device classified as &quot;Destructive Devices&quot;, which is a rather open-ended
<br>
definition although there are some regulatory guidelines.  However, a proper
<br>
Form 2 and broad explosives license should cover everything I would think.
<br>
<p>And last but not least, most of these regulations apply only to Natural
<br>
Persons.  It is a moderately well-known loophole that a Corporation (and
<br>
agents of the corporation) are not subject to many/most of these
<br>
regulations.
