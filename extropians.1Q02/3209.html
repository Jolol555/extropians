<em>&gt;&gt; But are they higher than the current alternative -- i.e., sending out a

<em>&gt; Well, it's all a matter of whether you can afford the investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to produce and put into the cycler orbit the infrastructure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly make it an energy and mass saving venture. You gotta spend money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make it.
</em><br>
<p>That is a recurring theme in space travel.  If you have a space elevator, 
<br>
e.g., you get a cheap way to orbit, but you have to build a space elevator 
<br>
first... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At this point, you run into the welfare pols who think that 'the money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is better spent here on earth' (as if the money is actually spent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space based malls or something) on 'human needs'.
</em><br>
<p>As you might guess, I want total privatization of the space program -- i.e., 
<br>
the conventional libertarian position.  I don't think Boeing, Rocketdyne, 
<br>
NASA, etc. should have welfare either. 
<br>
<p>Sadly, that's not going to happen anytime soon... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was thinking of packaging pieces in a cushioning/bracing material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which could be easily converted into fuel for spacecraft once in orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hear that there is a form of a plasma engine that uses teflon or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; styrofoam for fuel, so maybe this isn't such a kooky idea.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't sound so, though I wonder about how efficient it would be... 
<br>
<p>What if the packaging material is stuff than can used for other applications 
<br>
aside from propellant?  Off the top of my head, how about blankets and 
<br>
clothes as packing material? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having Alpha station up there and fully functional certainly is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuable asset for use as a staging base for assembly of bigger and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex interplanetary missions.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.  I'd like to see more and cheaper stations built, such as the 
<br>
ones External Tanks, Inc. has proposed -- using the shuttles external tank 
<br>
as the infrastructure.  Currently, the tanks are just thrown away.  Each one 
<br>
is much bigger than Alpha is now. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having the ability to disassemble packed pods in orbit opens up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of using the packaging concept to allow launch of equipment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from less expensive, higher G launch mechanisms, like guns and rail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launchers.
</em><br>
<p>That too, though immediately it would mean not having to design stuff to 
<br>
have to stand the rigors of less exotic launches in one piece.  (I mean 
<br>
launches using current launchers, such as Deltas, Arianes, Protons, and the 
<br>
like.)  It also allows for quality control in space and recovery and reuse 
<br>
of damaged items.  You would not longer have to fire and forget a damaged 
<br>
satelite -- or where possible (which is rarely the case) bank on a costly 
<br>
shuttle repair mission. 
<br>
<p>Cheers!
