<p>I just tell my coworkers I'm practicing my mad scientist laughter, and

they ignore it.

<p>Yes, but people are usually more eager to get a cure from something they
<br>
consider bad than something that makes them feel better. Of course, most
<br>
of us regard ageing as a serious disease, but we are not a majority.
<br>
Quite a few people might simply decide to wait and see or procrastinate
<br>
getting the treatment. Much will depend on how strong deathist ideas are
<br>
in culture.  A bit of rioting among the true enthusiasts is to be
<br>
expected, of course. 
<br>
<p>BTW, it is often assumed that there will be a single cure. A more likely
<br>
process is a series of increasingly effective treatments, but the
<br>
efficacy will be hard to estimate. It may take a very long time before
<br>
we actually know if ageing has been conquered.
