<p><em>&gt; Islam however is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centered around a much deeper belief that the Koran is literally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revealed truth, literally the Word of God and utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unquestionable along with many other &quot;sayings of Muhammad&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is far less &quot;wiggle room&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I'm no Islamic scholar, but I think this is way over the top. Many
<br>
Christians that I know believe that the Bible is literally revealed truth.
<br>
However there are basic textual problems with this, such as inconsistencies
<br>
between different gospels in the timing of events, that mean that the
<br>
entirety of the Bible cannot be literal truth in that sense.
<br>
<p>Similar problems are reported by Koranic scholars with the Koran e.g. (sorry
<br>
for quoting at length from this Washington post article, original at
<br>
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43785-2001Sep29?language=printer">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43785-2001Sep29?language=printer</a>
<br>
but I think it makes the point and is directly relevant to this
<br>
translation-focused thread):
<br>
<p>&quot;Understanding the Koran is essential for understanding Islam, because
<br>
Muslims believe the scripture Prophet Muhammad received in the 7th century
<br>
from the angel Gabriel to be the &quot;true word of God.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the Koran, like the Bible, presents problems of interpretation because
<br>
of contradictory passages about vengeance, war and peace.
<br>
<p>In one instance, the Koran advocates doing a good deed for an enemy instead
<br>
of retaliating against him. &quot;We ordained therein for them: 'Life for life,
<br>
eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal
<br>
for equal,' &quot; says Surah (Chapter) 5. &quot;But if any one remits the retaliation
<br>
by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself.&quot;
<br>
<p>Just a few verses earlier is this harsh warning to infidels: &quot;The punishment
<br>
of those who wage war against God and His Apostle, and strive with might and
<br>
main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the
<br>
cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land:
<br>
that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in
<br>
the Hereafter.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Torah in the Hebrew Bible, Moses
<br>
shares this fiery message from God as the Israelites prepare to enter the
<br>
Promised Land: &quot;I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
<br>
devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from
<br>
the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus amends an Old Testament call for vengeance
<br>
with a pronouncement that might have been the source for the similar text in
<br>
the Koran: &quot;Ye have heard . . . An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth:
<br>
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee
<br>
on they right cheek, turn to him the other also.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet a few chapters later, Jesus makes a pronouncement that has perplexed
<br>
Christians for centuries. &quot;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth,&quot;
<br>
Jesus tells his disciples. &quot;I came not to send peace, but a sword.&quot;
<br>
<p>The words of the Koran, which is about the same length as the New Testament,
<br>
are infallible -- but only in the original Arabic. Tradition holds that
<br>
other languages cannot approach the Arabic in style and accuracy, so Muslims
<br>
are required to read, recite and pray in Arabic.
<br>
<p>But some Arabic words present differing interpretations for Muslims and
<br>
non-Muslims alike, said Barbara Stowasser, a Koranic scholar and director of
<br>
the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown University.
<br>
<p>The most controversial example is jihad, whose noun and verb forms appear
<br>
more than 30 times in the 114 chapters, or surahs, in the Koran, Stowasser
<br>
said. In English translations, the word appears variously as &quot;struggle,&quot;
<br>
&quot;strive&quot; or &quot;fight.&quot;
<br>
<p>But in any language, mainstream Muslim scholars say, jihad refers primarily
<br>
to the inner faith struggle of the believer, not to physical confrontation.
<br>
They often recite a statement attributed to Muhammad after he returned from
<br>
battle: &quot;We are returning from the lesser jihad to the greater jihad --
<br>
jihad against the self.&quot;
<br>
<p>Osama bin Laden and other Muslim extremists &quot;pick and choose&quot; passages from
<br>
the Koran to support a global jihad, or holy war, against the United States
<br>
and other countries, Stowasser said, citing a passage from Surah 9 that is
<br>
sometimes used by militant Muslims.
<br>
<p>&quot;Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the
<br>
Apostle, and took the aggressive by being the first [to assault] you? . . .
<br>
Fight them, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame,
<br>
help you [to victory] over them, heal the breasts of Believers, and still
<br>
the indignation of their hearts.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Arabic word for &quot;fight&quot; in this passage is not jihad but qital, which
<br>
means &quot;fight with weapons,&quot; Stowasser said. The word jihad, translated below
<br>
as &quot;strive,&quot; is used two verses later to refer to the inner struggle of
<br>
Muslims who in 622 followed Muhammad into self-exile in Medina after a
<br>
decade of persecution in Mecca.
<br>
<p>&quot;Think ye that ye shall be abandoned, as though God did not know those among
<br>
you who strive with might and main, and take none for friends and protectors
<br>
except God, His Apostle, and the [community of] Believers? But God is
<br>
well-acquainted with [all] that ye do.&quot;
<br>
<p>The struggle within sometimes refers to using restraint during times of war.
<br>
&quot;Fight in the cause of God those who fight you,&quot; reads Surah 2, &quot;but do not
<br>
transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors.&quot; That means using only
<br>
the &quot;absolute minimum of destruction,&quot; Stowasser said.
<br>
<p>Two conditions warrant war, according to the Koran -- defense against
<br>
attackers and deposing an unjust ruler. But combatants are prohibited from
<br>
killing noncombatants, especially women and children. That injunction comes
<br>
from the Hadith, an extensive collection of Muhammad's sayings that were
<br>
written down by his followers and is, after the Koran, the second-most
<br>
sacred of Islam's texts.
<br>
<p>Mohammad Abu-Nimer, a professor in the International Peace and Conflict
<br>
Resolution Program at American University, said the prohibition against
<br>
killing innocents has been understood for centuries. Abu Bakr, the first
<br>
caliph, or great Muslim leader, after Muhammad's death in 632, instructed
<br>
his soldiers &quot;not to deviate from the right path,&quot; which included not
<br>
killing women, children or old men, and not mutilating dead bodies.
<br>
<p>Abu-Nimer, a Muslim Palestinian who grew up in Israel, frequently visits
<br>
Islamic countries and addresses concerns many Muslims have about the &quot;threat
<br>
against Islam&quot; posed by the United States and other Western countries. He
<br>
quotes passages from the Koran to underscore what he says is the underlying
<br>
theme of Islam -- peace.
<br>
<p>One is from Surah 17: Do not &quot;take life -- which God has made sacred --
<br>
except for just cause. And if anyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his
<br>
heir authority&quot; to demand justice for the death or to forgive it. &quot;But let
<br>
him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped [by the
<br>
Law].&quot;
<br>
<p>Surah 5 says that a person who kills another person for reasons other than
<br>
in response to &quot;murder or for spreading mischief in the land -- it would be
<br>
as if he slew the whole people: and if any one save a life, it would be as
<br>
if he saved the life of the whole people.&quot;
<br>
<p>Radical Muslims act out of a &quot;deep sense of injustice,&quot; Abu-Nimer said.
<br>
&quot;Certain groups take that injustice and fuel it with religion to justify
<br>
[terrorist] acts. That doesn't mean those actions are right, but it also
<br>
doesn't mean the injustice does not exist.&quot;
<br>
<p>Abu-Nimer said some clerics read literally passages in the Koran that talk
<br>
about going to war against the enemies of Islam and argue that the action is
<br>
defensive as the holy book requires. But he said the violent imagery, and
<br>
brutal punishment for the enemy, might have been appropriate for the &quot;tribal
<br>
culture&quot; of 1,500 years ago, when the text was written, but not today.
<br>
<p>&quot;Islam is a dynamic religion that interacts with the times. It's not
<br>
static,&quot; he said. Muslims who cannot adapt to the times &quot;are capable of
<br>
doing this crime as they've done it,&quot; he said of the attacks in Washington
<br>
and New York.
<br>
<p>Extremists who mete out punishment through terrorist attacks on innocent
<br>
people are &quot;blinded by their feeling of oppression and hatred,&quot; Abu-Nimer
<br>
said. &quot;They have an inability to distinguish what's in their religion and
<br>
what's without.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Koran is &quot;mainly about the values of peacemaking and how to bring
<br>
justice to an oppressed people,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not about how to use
<br>
violence indiscriminately.&quot;
<br>
<p>Surah 2 warns against using the name of Allah to justify evil acts: &quot;And
<br>
make not God's [name] an excuse in your oaths against doing good, or acting
<br>
rightly, or making peace between persons; for God is One Who heareth and
<br>
knoweth all things.&quot;
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Geraint
