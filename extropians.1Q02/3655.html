<em>&gt; &gt;least some episodes were written by communist/socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sympathizers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They had to have a woman captain, a black vulcan, a Native American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first officer, I mean come on!
</em><br>
<p>Well, I thought the woman captain and native american first officer were
<br>
both plausible characters, in how the got where they were and
<br>
everything, and I suppose it wouldn't be too implausible that alien
<br>
species would have distinct 'races' as much as humans do (though how
<br>
much variety would be left in humanity in the 23rd century anyways?). 
<br>
<p>I have the opinion that Kate Mulgrew's character is a far better man
<br>
than Picard... ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I liked the holographic doctor and I never did see one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; episodes with the race that crushed 9 Borg cubes, I was always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curious about them.
</em><br>
<p>Well, at first they came off EXTREMELY menacing. They'd have to be to
<br>
make Janeway even consider the idea of an alliance with the Borg. Their
<br>
ethic of 'evolve or perish' is presented I think as a very negative
<br>
representation of some extropic ideals. They came from I think an
<br>
alternate universe through gateways in 'chaotic space'.
<br>
<p>A season or two later, after Voyager is safely out of Borg space, they
<br>
find that someone is occasionally impersonating Chocotay on board ship
<br>
in various locations. Turns out its an agent of that species (I think
<br>
the borg called them &quot;Species 3472&quot;) involved in a project researching
<br>
the human race. Species 3472 got the impression that the Federation was
<br>
openly allied with the Borg, and thus felt that it was an enemy to go
<br>
after.
<br>
<p>Voyager kills the agent, and Chocotay returns in his place to a training
<br>
center run by species 3472 that is a replica of Starfleet Academy. The
<br>
leader is that old fellow who is the campus gardener.
<br>
<p>In the end, Janeway makes peace with species 3472.
