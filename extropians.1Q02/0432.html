I know that discussion  of cosmological matters without proper grounding
<br>
is a way to make a fool of one's self but there are some fundamentals
<br>
that seem only logical.
<br>
<p>That our time and space are the only such occurance of a physical
<br>
universe would be not unlike the midieval people who thought that the
<br>
earth was the center of the universe.  So if the universe is deemed to
<br>
expand forever into nothingness then perhaps that is only from our
<br>
perspective.  The 4 dimensions we directly sense are theorized to be not
<br>
&quot;all that  exists&quot;.  The concept that human life is the only form of
<br>
intelligence or that or concept of &quot;sentient life&quot; is the only self
<br>
aware form of matter/energy is self limiting. So the question is what
<br>
are the possible mechanisms which would reverse the unlimited repulsion
<br>
into something cyclic in whole or part.   What are the fundamental
<br>
mechanisms to conserve information.   Can the sum total of the universe
<br>
be programmed to conserve information?

<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Life and intelligence could sustain themselves indefinitely in such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a universe, even as the stars winked out and the galaxies were all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swallowed by black holes, Dr. Freeman Dyson, a physicist at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute for Advanced Study, argued in a landmark paper in 1979. &quot;If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my view of the future is correct,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it means that the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics and astronomy is also inexhaustible; no matter how far we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go into the future, there will always be new things happening, new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information coming in, new worlds to explore, a constantly expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain of life, consciousness, and memory.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, however, even Dr. Dyson admits that all bets are off. If recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronomical observations are correct, the future of life and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe will be far bleaker.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the last four years astronomers have reported evidence that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion of the universe is not just continuing but is speeding up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the influence of a mysterious &quot;dark energy,&quot; an antigravity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be embedded in space itself. If that is true and the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes on accelerating, astronomers say, rather than coasting gently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the night, distant galaxies will eventually be moving apart so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly that they cannot communicate with one another. In effect, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be like living in the middle of a black hole that kept getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emptier and colder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In such a universe, some physicists say, the usual methods of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulating physics may not all apply. Instead of new worlds coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into view, old ones would constantly be disappearing over the horizon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost from view forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cosmological knowledge would be fragmented, with different observers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doomed to seeing different pieces of the puzzle and no single observer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to know the fate of the whole universe or arrive at a theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics that was more than approximate.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
