(Phil Osborn)
<br>
<em>&gt; This is so-oo depressing.  Like, how many times do we have to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-inventing the wheel? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ayn Rand covered this topic rather well, I thought, and I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed that as astute a group as extropians would surely have absorbed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least the basics of Rand's thought with their mother's milk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Briefly, the question &quot;what is the purpose of life&quot; contains an error
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of category.  Things only HAVE purposes TO living entities.  Purpose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHOM and FOR WHAT????  Purpose only has meaning with regard to a living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity.  To ask then - what is the purpose of LIFE? - is meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LIFE creates and identifies purposes.  (This does not mean, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all purposes are equally valid.  Life itself - and each living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity - has a specific identity.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, she was almost right on that one: purpose requires an entity
<br>
capable of /desire/ and /free will/; such an entity must be able to
<br>
form goals that support its desires, and can therefore choose its
<br>
own purposes.  Whether or not such an entity is &quot;life&quot; is an
<br>
entirely orthogonal issue.  Rand was not qualified to comment on the
<br>
question of whether an AI would have these features.  As usual, though,
<br>
she didn't let her ignorance get in the way of expressing and opinion,
<br>
and she simply declared by fiat that robots weren't &quot;alive&quot; and
<br>
couldn't have free will or desire or purpose.  There is no reason to
<br>
think she was correct on that score.
