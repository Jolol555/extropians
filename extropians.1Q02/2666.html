<em>&gt; &gt; So the US is no longer a free or capitalistic country since we

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The forfeiture you speak of is specifically in the case where a person

</em><br>
<em>&gt; conviction, their property is seized by the government in civil court

</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole, by the proceeds of drug money, leaving the owner to prove that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not always.  Not to go off on another whining-about-Florida-rant, but....
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>In Florida, carrying large sums of cash, say over $10,000, is legally
<br>
defined as &quot;suspicious&quot;.  The police can and do seize such large amounts of
<br>
cash under the assumption that it is drug money.  The cash can be retrieved
<br>
only if the person can prove where it came from and that it was obtained
<br>
legally.  Any unexplained cash that is not later retrieved is simply kept by
<br>
the government.
<br>
<p>The laws that allow this behavior are based on drug laws.  The cash is
<br>
seized as &quot;evidence&quot; under &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that a crime has been
<br>
committed.  Since no person is charged with any crime, there are no courts,
<br>
rights or procedures to follow.  The police in each county can set their own
<br>
policies about how people can apply to retrieve their property.  This is a
<br>
very controversial topic in Florida.
<br>
<p>The nation DEA, FDA and IRS have similar powers to sieze property under
<br>
suspicion, and it is up to the individual to prove that they are innocent
<br>
before they can get their property back.
