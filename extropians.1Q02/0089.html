<p>
Agreement with Kai is probably as good a note as any to end on.
<br>
<p>If we were in the middle of something, please forgive me. If I don't rise
<br>
to any bait, it's because I've taken a vow of silence and practice in other
<br>
areas of my life.
<br>
<p>I might post an occasional valuable article, but it appears that my accustomed
<br>
breezy style doesn't suit the regulations, which I think were well-considered.
<br>
I would point out, however, that I was going to make my posts more focused, and
<br>
had begun to do so. I cornered, but my posting volume still hit the guardrail.
<br>
<p>In effect, I care too much about interplay to slow down to eight posts per diem without
<br>
adult supervision. I bear no ill will to the supervisor, but I can use the spare cycles
<br>
myself, come to think of it.
<br>
<p>I don't know how to turn this list from a watering hole to a tight focused list
<br>
in one gulp. Permit me to reiterate that I bear no ill will to anyone, least of 
<br>
all the person who advised me that I had exceeded eight posts in one day.
<br>
<p>I guess you-all will have to turn the list into a tight focused one while I watch
<br>
from the sidelines. In effect, by so doing I will be helping that happen, too.
<br>
<p>Time for me to act more like Greg Burch and get a life.
<br>
<p>Good luck to the list supervisors with their heuristics.
<br>
<p>All best, always,
<br>

  I am not here to have an argument.  I am here as part of a civilization... And you?
