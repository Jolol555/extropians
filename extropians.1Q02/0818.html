From: Robert J. Bradbury [mailto:<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=RE:%20MEDIA:%20NOVA%20on%20Gamma%20Ray%20Bursters">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>]
<br>
<p><p><p>An advanced intelligence is only going to create an agent
<br>
to do the exploring *if* it can guarantee that that agent
<br>
will never decide to consume the resources of the creator.
<br>
Can it do that?  Only if it significantly handicaps the
<br>
evolutionary paths the agent may pursue (IMO).  (Of course
<br>
if you want to give birth to children that consume you, so
<br>
be it (there are some models in nature for this), but it isn't
<br>
a very good survival strategy IMO).
<br>
<p>### I wouldn't be sure about it. If the agent is more efficient than you, it
<br>
might be also more efficient than your enemies. If there is any deadly
<br>
strife going on between the advanced intelligences, the losing side might be
<br>
willing to develop and release a destructive self-propagating entity (a la
<br>
Blight), just to cripple the other side, even if it would seal its own fate.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
*So*, one may become an essentialy existentialist actor --
<br>
&quot;I might as well live today, because sooner or later
<br>
my children, agents, seeds, etc. will eliminate me.&quot;
<br>
*or* one says that I am not going to produce anything
<br>
that may compete with me for future resources.
<br>
<p>### The one civilization with a different attitude is enough to change the
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Thus
<br>
one only creates sub-minds running on your own hardware
<br>
and one deletes these programs once they have outlived
<br>
their usefullness.)
<br>
<p>### This severely limits your abilities. Your competitors willing to take
<br>
some risks would swamp you with armies of their spawned copies.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>What is the most &quot;trustable&quot; agent?  One that you can
<br>
squash like a bug if it threatens you in any way.
<br>
As recent events have shown -- if you give an agent
<br>
a certain amount of power, then ignore it, it may
<br>
grow to a level that it can inflict significant harm
<br>
upon oneself.  In which case you have to apply significant
<br>
resources to eliminating such agents and may have relatively
<br>
little confidence that you have been successful in doing so.
<br>
I do not believe that is the way that &quot;advanced&quot; civiliztions
<br>
(or more probably SIs) will behave.
<br>
<p>### Only one exception is needed. Are you saying that 100% of conceivable
<br>
SI's will limit themselves?
<br>
<p>---- 
<br>
<p>It seems to me that for an ATC to produce an expansionary
<br>
perspective it must give up a survival perspective.
<br>
<p>### Why not? This trick if applied to individuals was quite successfull, as
<br>
ants and Wahhabis show. With large numbers of civilizations generated by
<br>
random drift, some will reach this spot in the behavior configuration space,
<br>
and then radiate, even if it means losing most of their primitive
<br>
characteristics.
