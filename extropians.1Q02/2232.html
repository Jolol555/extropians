<p><p>We are involved in becoming trans- or post-human.  So to claim 
<br>
that is only becoming fully &quot;human&quot; seems to me to be a bit 
<br>
lacking.  We strive to become effectively immortal, effectively 
<br>
unlimited (except by the maximum acheivable to even what we may 
<br>
become) in our ability to grow in knowledge, in wisdom, in 
<br>
thinking ability and in ability to manipulate reality.  Our 
<br>
ability cannot be artificially limited.  It is not at all beyond 
<br>
the possible that we will create and destroy worlds, solar 
<br>
systems and so on.  It is quite likely that we will be able to 
<br>
create life out of raw matter and energy.  If these abilities 
<br>
don't qualify as &quot;becoming as gods&quot; then I do not know what is 
<br>
missing.  It is to be fervently hoped that we also develop 
<br>
wisdom as we attain such powers.  In any case, the resulting 
<br>
being[s] are not adequately described as simply &quot;fully human&quot;.
<br>
<p>I suggest we put some energy into considering what kind of gods 
<br>
and goddesses we will be.  I think the exercise is critical to 
<br>
attaining some of the needed wisdom, wisdom needed long before 
<br>
we transcend the bounds of the merely &quot;human&quot;.
