<em>&gt;I was in general unimpressed by the arguments of &quot;Luxury Fever&quot;.  I agree

that
<br>
<em>&gt;many people are driven by envy and care about relative standing.  I don't

see
<br>

at

it.
<br>
<p>&quot;In a society in which rewards are much more dispersed, a larger fraction
<br>
of people are able to accomplish what they attempt.
<br>
&nbsp;That's why the arguments in Luxury Fever imply that there are negative
<br>
externalities associated with celebrity-worship. Since I don't see any way
<br>
to internalize those externalities, I therefore believe that a moral system
<br>
which creates social pressure to make choices that reduce inequality will
<br>
produce a nicer society than a moral system that claims inequality doesn't
<br>
matter.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I am currently reading a book, 'Non Zero: The Logic of Human Destiny' which
<br>
both of you might find interesting.  The author, Robert Wright, argues that
<br>
the growing level of non-zero competitions between people and cultures
<br>
allows and encourages all people in those cultures to be wealthier, happier,
<br>
and live longer lives.  This increase in non-zero interaction stems directly
<br>
from technological innovations in communication, information, and
<br>
transportation.  Those technological developments further increase the rate
<br>
at which other technological innovations come about, as more people can
<br>
build on what others figured out, as a consequence cultural barriers fall
<br>
and the world is open up to free exchange of ideas and products.
<br>
Consequently and paradoxically that freedom invites new cultural barriers to
<br>
arise, allowing once fledgling and disparate groups to unite and gain
<br>
political clout, but Wright argues that the general trend is one that leads
<br>
to longer and better lives for the whole world.
<br>
<p>That materialism and luxury fever you mention also provided us all (well,
<br>
post-industrialized 'us') with warm cozy homes that are inexpensive (use to
<br>
be only the really wealthy had homes), running water (used to be only the
<br>
really wealthy had running water) Heat (used to be only the really wealthy
<br>
had heat) Hot water, good medical care (even if you can not pay for it, you
<br>
are guaranteed by law to receive stabilized health care in the US) and
<br>
longer, healthier lives.  Think of the influence and changes in our lives
<br>
that cheap electrical generation and transmission brought about by
<br>
capitalistic competition has sowed.  Even rudimentary things available to
<br>
third world country members are superior to many of the items that only the
<br>
wealthiest had centuries ago.  The caloric consumption of 3rd world nations
<br>
is increasing every year, and has increased ~30% since 1968, chiefly due to
<br>
those big mean agribusiness making money of food, while competing with each
<br>
other.  Making food nearly dirt cheap makes it more and more difficult to
<br>
keep out of the hands of even the poorest people.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That's why life is so much better for everyone, including the worst off.
</em><br>
<p>&quot; Everyone? Do you deny that there are people who have lost their job
<br>
security due to economic change? Do you deny that there are people whose
<br>
pristine view of lake Tahoe has become less valuable because someone else
<br>
became wealthy enough to build another house within that view?
<br>
&nbsp;The economic progress that I observe looks like some people (often a large
<br>
majority) benefitting from an innovation while others lose something as a
<br>
result. It's hard to explain the widespread controversy over policies that
<br>
promote economic progress unless I notice the existence of people who are
<br>
hurt by such progress.&quot;
<br>
<p>I guess it all depends on what you define 'hurt' by economic progress to be.
<br>
Getting a lake view obstructed isn't what I considered 'hurt' by economic
<br>
progress, nor is laying off candle makers to make way for the electric light
<br>
bulb.  In that example, as in most other similar ones, a small fraction of
<br>
the population benefits by continuing to make candles (or cars, or TV's,
<br>
etc.), a much larger portion of the population benefits by making light
<br>
bulbs, and subsequently putting candle makers out of business.  What about
<br>
the poor candle makers?  Well, to bad for them.  Utilitarian ethicians site
<br>
the greatest good for the greatest number.  Kantianists site respect for
<br>
persons, modern ethicians search for a utilitarian view while maintaining
<br>
respect for persons.  Putting someone out of work because of a technological
<br>
innovation does not violate the right of the individual as theft, assault,
<br>
or enslavement does, and the rest of the world benefits by getting cheaper,
<br>
stronger, safer products.  Poor out of work American work still has health
<br>
care, welfare, heat, hot water, and many other things even that absolute
<br>
richest people of centuries ago could only dream about.  Sure, the rich get
<br>
richer and the gap between rich and poor expands, but the poor get richer as
<br>
well (how many poverty level US citizens have more than 1 color TV I
<br>
wonder?) and that gap isn't a mythical vacuum, its being filled by the
<br>
middle class, whose standard of living also continues to increase.  I say on
<br>
with progress, and should I get laid off, I'll start learning a new career,
<br>
and I will be happy that fewer people are starving to death, getting beaten
<br>
to death, or executed by oppressive governments SPECIFICALLY because of the
<br>
spread of increasingly less expensive technology brought on by greedy
<br>
capitalist materialistic incentives.
