Can it do that?  Only if it significantly handicaps the
<br>
evolutionary paths the agent may pursue (IMO).  (Of course
<br>
if you want to give birth to children that consume you, so
<br>
be it (there are some models in nature for this), but it isn't
<br>
a very good survival strategy IMO).

<p>No assumptions are required if you assume the singularity

rapidly drives them to optimality.
<br>
<p>I'm going to repeat this every time this discussion comes up.
<br>
<p>WE DO *NOT* HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT THE UNIVERSE
<br>
IS NOT IN LARGE PART ALREADY ENGINEERED.
<br>
<p>The faulty assumption is that if the engineering could
<br>
be done, everything would appear &quot;engineered&quot; (to us).
<br>
*We* can engineer, yet there are parts of the Earth and
<br>
solar system that appear very un-engineered -- whether
<br>
by intent or simply the fact that we haven't gotten around
<br>
to engineering them because they is no economic benefit
<br>
(or we may lack the matter &amp; energy resources) to engineer
<br>
them at this point.
<br>
<p>One can make a strong assertion that in the beginning there
<br>
was no engineering.  One may make an assertion that in
<br>
the end (after all the protons decay, if they do so)
<br>
there will be no surviving engineering.  But given that
<br>
we and our engineering exist -- the simplest assumption
<br>
is that we are someplace in the middle of the development
<br>
of engineering the universe.
<br>
<p>The historic arguments have been that &quot;seeds&quot; are cheap
<br>
or &quot;independent actors&quot; will explore and colonize.
<br>
But you have to get this (I've thought about it a
<br>
lot) -- once you know you have trumped the hazard
<br>
function of the galaxy -- &quot;seeds&quot; and &quot;independent
<br>
actors&quot; are significant threats to your long-term
<br>
survival!
<br>
<p>*So*, one may become an essentialy existentialist actor --
<br>
&quot;I might as well live today, because sooner or later
<br>
my children, agents, seeds, etc. will eliminate me.&quot;
<br>
*or* one says that I am not going to produce anything
<br>
that may compete with me for future resources.  (Thus
<br>
one only creates sub-minds running on your own hardware
<br>
and one deletes these programs once they have outlived
<br>
their usefullness.)
<br>
<p>What is the most &quot;trustable&quot; agent?  One that you can
<br>
squash like a bug if it threatens you in any way.
<br>
As recent events have shown -- if you give an agent
<br>
a certain amount of power, then ignore it, it may
<br>
grow to a level that it can inflict significant harm
<br>
upon oneself.  In which case you have to apply significant
<br>
resources to eliminating such agents and may have relatively
<br>
little confidence that you have been successful in doing so.
<br>
I do not believe that is the way that &quot;advanced&quot; civiliztions
<br>
(or more probably SIs) will behave.
