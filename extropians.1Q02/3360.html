<p>I think this doesn't give enough credit to our ability to raise dogs in a
<br>
consistent way.  (My sources are &quot;How to be Your Dog's Best Friend&quot; by the
<br>
Monks of New Skete, and other books.)  My impression is that people who raise
<br>
pure-bred dogs over long periods of time know how to raise dogs with
<br>
relatively consistent personalities to make good pets.  They don't know how to
<br>
duplicate the upbringing of a random dog, but if you can do a reasonable job
<br>
of characterizing the environment of your beloved pet, you can do pretty well.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>If you pet is a collie, a german shepherd, or a dachshund (for a few
<br>
instances), it's fairly certain that a clone would appear identical.  If it's
<br>
a beagle or a dalmation, the appearance would be as similar as a litter-mate.
<br>
<p>All that said, my dog is a mutt, and we got her at the age of three.  The
<br>
evidence is pretty pervasive that she had an inconsistent upbringing.  I don't
<br>
think we could expect to duplicate her personality.  (She doesn't like water,
<br>
and at the age of ~10 she's getting over her distrust for tall, thin, older
<br>
men.)  On the other hand, I'd bet a well-raised clone would get along with
<br>
kids, and would love to climb and dig and run.  Her appearance is regular
<br>
enough that I'd expect a clone to look very similar.  (She has highlights in
<br>
namable places, rather than a variegated pattern.)
<br>
<p>I'd also bet an unlimited amount of money that her clone would bark at mailmen
<br>
and like to chase squirrels.  Why wouldn't these kinds of details be close
<br>
enough for many?  I'll bet they get a pretty good dog if the missyplicity
<br>
project succeeds in producing a healthy clone.
