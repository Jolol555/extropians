I should perhaps elaborate in my previous reply to

<p><em>&gt;&gt;  That said I have to ask.. are you a socialist?
</em><br>
<p>[I said:]
<br>
<em>&gt; I am not now nor have I ever been a member of the Communist Party. (Are
</em><br>
you *nuts*?)
<br>
<p>I assumed that this wry reference to the formula used by the vile
<br>
inquisitorial House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the USA during the
<br>
1950s would do, but I see now that it needs a bit more work.
<br>
<p>The background political assumptions of Australians appear to differ in
<br>
subtle and less subtle ways from those of Americans, and even more from
<br>
those of many Europeans. I found a quote today that helps position our
<br>
historic standpoint; it's from Alfred Deakin, an early Prime Minister of
<br>
the nation, who in 1906 (just five years after Federation) said this:
<br>
<p>`The best thing that Australians could do was to make the country so
<br>
productive, so good a place to live, and bring about such just and fair
<br>
conditions, with such  fair opportunities for earning an honest living,
<br>
such protection against monopolies, that other people would also want to
<br>
become Australians.'
<br>
<p>Federation was celebrated a week or so back, and occasioned an essay by
<br>
novelist and public intellectual Thomas Keneally, who wrote in part of:
<br>
<p>`the more than 800,000 Australian children--more children than were living
<br>
in the whole of Australia at the time of Federation--both of whose parents
<br>
are on welfare.
<br>
<p>`And whatever side of the welfare debate one takes, we are all united today
<br>
in seeing this as undesirable, in knowing that it is costly in all sorts of
<br>
ways, and brings misery and hostility into the lives of most of those
<br>
affected.
<br>
<p>`Although... there may not be enough jobs to go around, and this may become
<br>
increasingly the case for the so-called less-skilled workers, the souls of
<br>
the poor, and the souls of those 800,000 children, are as skillfully
<br>
calibrated as anyone else's in the capacity to feel want, rejection and
<br>
despair... But the great thing is that most of us still believe our society
<br>
is flexible enough, and blessed with sufficient wealth and resources, to
<br>
amend whatever faults we see in it.' He cites Peter Botsman, a left
<br>
theoretician, who argues that `part of the achievable answer... consists
<br>
not of condemning people to hopelessness, but of &quot;giving back control and
<br>
power to people and communities to solve their own problems&quot;. That, and
<br>
schemes of enlightened volunteerism, of creative programs that will give
<br>
dispossessed children access to a broader world, can rescue threatened
<br>
families.' He continues with appeals to the fraternal and typically
<br>
skeptical voluntarism of those who fight raging bush fires, which is akin
<br>
to the heroism of the men in New York during the terrorist attacks, except
<br>
that these people are not professionals.
<br>
<p>This provides the flavor of Australian views; I would add (for what it's
<br>
worth, and because I was asked) that my own understanding of this sentiment
<br>
in theory and practice leans toward traditional anarchism, of a
<br>
communitarian kind--the sort of mutual support that only free men and women
<br>
can offer each other. 
<br>
<p>Don't mistake that for socialism, or I'll have to order the Commissar to
<br>
take you off to the Gulag.
