</em><br>
<p>Indeed, this is a very interesting text and well worth reading and
<br>
thinking about. Hakim Bey is more concerned with the issue of
<br>
how the primitivists and extropians would impact on his own project of
<br>
autonomous zones than whether their philosophies are &quot;right&quot;. But his
<br>
critique of extropianism is still relevant:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously for the Extropians, mediation per se cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined as &quot;impurity&quot; or as the invariable source of separation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alienation, and hierarchy. Nevertheless, it remains obvious that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separation does in fact occur
</em><br>
<p>Translated, this would mean that extropians do not see technological
<br>
mediation - our technological exoselves that interface us with the world
<br>
and each other through telecommunications, cars, prepackaged food and
<br>
glasses - as an inevitable source of separation from the real world and
<br>
each other. This is contrary to what primitivists, romantics, luddites,
<br>
marxists and many other critics of modernity claim. 
<br>
<p>I think at the core this is due to a different sense of the meaning and
<br>
importance of authenticity: to us authentic means something entirely
<br>
different from the very much nature-linked sense the term is used by
<br>
them. I think most of us would say that a life as a posthuman upload in
<br>
a nanotech Dyson sphere is just as authentic as living as a hunter
<br>
gatherer in the paleolithic; it is more about a subjective sense of
<br>
identity than anything rooted in physical or metaphysical reality. To
<br>
us, the mood change brought about by Prozac is just as authentic as the
<br>
same change brought about by therapy (we can still recognize that a
<br>
cognitive therapy making a person better able to cope and control his
<br>
emotions will in the long run be preferrable to a &quot;chemical fix&quot;, it is
<br>
just that the mood itself has its own authenticity). In the end I think
<br>
our position can be viewed as &quot;authenticity is information&quot;, while many
<br>
of our critics think that &quot;authenticity is in the object&quot;. 
<br>
<p>However, authenticity is also - especially in marxist and existentialist
<br>
discourse - closely linked to social aspects. This is what Bey continues
<br>
with:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that it amounts to immiseration, that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is bound up in some way with techn? and mediation, that not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology is &quot;liberating&quot; according to any anarchist definition of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, and that some of it is downright oppressive. The Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore lacks and needs a critique of technology, and of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly complex relation between the social and the technical. No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one with any intelligence can any longer accept the notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology as &quot;morally neutral,&quot; with control of the means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production the only criteria for valuation. The social and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological are somehow bound in a complex relation of co-creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or &quot;co-evolution&quot;), such that techn? shapes cognition even as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition shapes techn?.
</em><br>
<p>Bey means roughly that technology (and he means it in its widest sense,
<br>
not just special devices but also &quot;technologies&quot; such as economics and
<br>
psychology) is not value-neutral, but that some technology has inherent
<br>
consequences that are ethically relevant. In his analysis this is not
<br>
due to anything directly inherent in the technology itself, but rather
<br>
in the fact that it is impossible to separate technology from the social
<br>
environment - economy, culture, politics and all that. Technology is
<br>
developed because of what humans think and want, and these things are
<br>
bound up to our society; the new technology changes society, and we get
<br>
a complex tangle of feedback where everything does have ethical
<br>
implications. 
<br>
<p>I agree with him about this. Seeing technology as something cleanly
<br>
separated from society, something that develops on its own according to
<br>
its own rules, does not work - the history of technology shows that it
<br>
is always deeply involved in the messy process of cultural change. This
<br>
is not anything deterministic, and individual humans can and do affect
<br>
it a lot, which means it has ethical implications. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately quite a few transhumanists do tend towards fairly
<br>
simplistic technological determinism or separate technology from its
<br>
cultural side, and this produces an inability to do a good critique of
<br>
technology. If technology is just something bringing us towards a future
<br>
utopia on its own, then technology is simply good and there is no point
<br>
in further debate about whether Microsoft's software is a good thing. If
<br>
the value of technology is determined solely by the values of those
<br>
bringing it into existence and the applications it is put to, then it is
<br>
impossible to criticise secondary effects (is it a good thing that we
<br>
can be constantly reached using cellphones, and a culture assuming this
<br>
seems to be emerging?). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the extropian vision of the future is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viable it cannot depend on &quot;machine evolution&quot; alone to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realization. But unless anarcho-futurism can develop a critique of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, it is relegated precisely to this passive role.
</em><br>
<p>Which I also agree with. We will not get to transhumanity just by
<br>
inventing the right tools, we have to change ourselves and our
<br>
culture too. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, I prefer the burden of inconsistency (even &quot;foolish&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistency) to the burden of the Absolute. Only an impure theory can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do justice to the impurity of the present -which, as everyone knows, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only a psychological impossibility caught between a lost past and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonexistent future.
</em><br>
<p>I.e., beware of oversimplified utopias where everything is black and
<br>
white. Such thinking requires you to do away with all of the present
<br>
world and to remake it into something completely different. It has a
<br>
hard time being tolerant and pluralistic, and can very easily turn into
<br>
something totalitarian. 
<br>
<p>It is better to start out with the current messy situation and look at
<br>
how it could get to a better - but still messy - situation. Sometimes
<br>
oversimplifactions and gedankenexperiments can help us think, but they
<br>
should be recognized as the crutches they are. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose we were to ask -as anarchists- what should be done about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem of technology &quot;after the revolution.&quot; This exercise in utopian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poetics may help us to clarify the question of desire, and of praxis in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;present.&quot; The primitivist might argue that there can be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolution without the abolition of symbolic mediation, or at least of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the technological imperative; extropians might say that no revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can occur without technological transcendence. But both parties must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perforce admit a transitional stage, when de facto power has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seized by the &quot;Revolution,&quot; but the full unfolding of revolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society has yet to occur. Let's imagine that the one rough principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreed upon by &quot;everyone&quot; is the freedom of the individual from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercion by the group, and the freedom of the (self-organized) group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from coercion by all other groups. The only &quot;price&quot; of this freedom is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it damage no other free and autonomous interests.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; I suspect that this &quot;utopia&quot; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove disappointing to both the primitives and the extropians. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect that a workable utopia would adhere more closely to the &quot;messy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model than to either of the &quot;pure&quot; models of the pro-tech/anti-tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorists. Like bolo'bolo, I imagine a complex multiplicity of social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models co-existing under the voluntary aegis of the social &quot;price&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutual non-coercion. In effect the primitivists will get less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wilderness than they demand, and the extropians will get less tech.
</em><br>
<p>This is a very good thought experiment (and as such, a crutch for
<br>
thinking rather than a recipe of How To Do It). His point is that if we
<br>
somehow manage to overturn the current situation and create essentially
<br>
an anarchist world (his description seems a bit like my ideas about
<br>
metafederations and Nozick's utopia, a world composed of communities
<br>
with their own internal rules and much freedom to move between them) the
<br>
world will not become a primitive utopia or a posthuman utopia. It would
<br>
likely be a messy mixture of both - there would be extropians pursuing
<br>
supertech, and right next to them the local luddites trying to live a
<br>
neomedieval life. But neither would get the pure world: the luddites
<br>
would find themselves using some neat tech or having to accept the
<br>
existence of GM plants, the extropians would have to accept both a large
<br>
number of people not interested in their visions and a slower rate of
<br>
progress than would have been if everybody had been trying to storm the
<br>
cosmos. 
<br>
<p>Bey seem to be optimistic about that this is feasible, and this may be
<br>
his own utopian flight of fancy. After all, getting from here to there
<br>
will not be a clean break if it happens, but in itself a messy imperfect
<br>
process. It could very well be that we still will have some of our old
<br>
insitutions even after the Revolution - there might be a Microsoft even
<br>
then - and it will likely not be as perfectly anarchist or nice as we
<br>
would like. Which is acceptable, because the alternative is to seek a
<br>
perfect revolution which is impossible to realize in the real world.
