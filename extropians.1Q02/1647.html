<p>Yes, i also started a second BSc in Biochem last year (currently
<br>
cryonised), and was very tempted to setup a lab in my garage.  One
<br>
problem was that i didn't have a garage.  That is solved now, but the
<br>
other, more important, problem is cost.  Centrifugues look cheap and
<br>
seem almost easy to build, but gels cost $A10 a pop, and the enzyme
<br>
prices are astronomical.  Considering the percentage of botched pracs (&gt;
<br>
75%) i did last year, it could become a very expensive hobby.
