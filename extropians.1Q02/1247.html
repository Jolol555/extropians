<em>&gt; I don't think it is accurate to say gay dating or sex is illegal
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they selectively enforce.
</em><br>
<p>OK, I just checked this at a law site.  Only 17/50 U.S. states still have
<br>
such laws on the books.  That's one-third instead of &quot;most&quot;.
<br>
<p>In the state of Florida, where I live, gay sex violates sodomy laws.  Our
<br>
laws don't even let married heterosexual couples engage in sodomy.  Not only
<br>
is this type of sex illegal, but soliciting illegal sex violates
<br>
solicitation laws.  Thus, asking for gay sex or for a gay date that might
<br>
include sex is illegal.  Loitering for illicit purposes includes looking for
<br>
partners for illegal sexual activities.  Thus, waiting around for a possible
<br>
gay date to show up is also illegal.
<br>
<p>These laws are alive and well.  Florida forbids unmarried adults from
<br>
sharing a hotel room.  The tourism council tried to get this reversed a few
<br>
years ago, but failed.  We just had a controversy where Jeb Bush's son was
<br>
caught by police violating the sodomy laws with a female.  Since he was not
<br>
charged by police, gay rights activists asked Jeb to pardon gays in jail for
<br>
breaking the same law.  This never happened.
<br>
<p>I know most of these laws seem like something out of the 1800's, but most of
<br>
them have never been officially repealed.  When repeals are attempted, the
<br>
religious right objects to the repeal.  Even if the law isn't enforced, most
<br>
lawmakers don't want to appear to be encouraging unmarried sexual behavior,
<br>
so they don't vote for the repeals.
<br>
<p>I concede that most gays ignore these laws with no consequences, but there
<br>
are gays in jail for nothing more than having gay sex or soliciting for gay
<br>
sex.
<br>
<p>Check out &lt;<a href="http://www.sodomylaws.org/">http://www.sodomylaws.org/</a>&gt; for more details on these laws.  The
<br>
penalties range from life imprisonment, 20 years, 15 years, 10 years, 5
<br>
years, 6 months, 60 days, and a $500 fine.  By the way, my state's example
<br>
above have the most lenient laws with only 60 days in jail or a $500 fine.
