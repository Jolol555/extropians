</em><br>
<p>I was not involved with the World Transhumanist Association when I wrote the
<br>
essay, and only decided to get involved on the basis of the conclusions I
<br>
drew in it. The essay doesn't represent the views of the WTA, which I/we
<br>
hope will be a very broad tent including libertarians, Greens, social
<br>
democrats, centrists and the apolitical.
<br>
<p>I especially hope that you don't hold my essay against the WTA since we want
<br>
the Extropy Institute to join as an organizational affiliate, and would like
<br>
extropians to join as individuals.
<br>
<p>As for Rasmussen's observation (which I was originally delighted to
<br>
attribute to you, thinking you were &quot;Max M.&quot;), as someone who has expressed
<br>
my democratic socialist views on the Extropy list at various points over the
<br>
last eight years and been routinely flamed, I think he was fair to observe
<br>
that the Extrop list did not often have left of center views expressed. I
<br>
have seen more in this last year. As I say in the essay, I think the
<br>
transhumanist milieu is growing and becoming more diverse, and the
<br>
representation of political views is increasing.
