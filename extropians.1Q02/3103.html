Furthermore, the terminology I do use (especially recently) is drawn more from

the &quot;brain science&quot; end of cognitive science than the &quot;computer science&quot; end. 
<br>
So even where I use standard terminology, such as &quot;complex functional
<br>
adaptation&quot;, and cite a source, such as Tooby and Cosmides 1992, the average
<br>
AI guy may not recognize it (although the average brain science guy certainly

will).

<p>I thought now many AI researchers were drawing a great deal of inspiration from the neurosciences?  Or is it only a handful?  And aren't there quite a number of books written on this subject?  Perhaps it is just too hard for most researchers to be really well-trained in both &quot;brain science&quot; and &quot;computer science.&quot;  
<br>
<p>you continue:
<br>
In truth, I suspect that the new paper, howsoever conforming to the standards
<br>
of academia, will still be harder to read than plain old informal GISAI,
<br>
especially since my goal for this paper is a more complete explanation tied
<br>
into existing theory, rather than a simpler and more approachable explanation.
<br>

<p>I think there are two problems here.  One is that as some have said, you lack formal college training, academic experience, and degree(s).  The second and much larger difficulty I believe is that you are a man ahead of his time.  It may take awhile for the rest of the world to catch up to you.  
<br>
<p>best wishes,
