<em>&gt;those options.  CNN also reports that Enron froze the employee's 401K funds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so that employees were prevented from selling their stock while executives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continued selling theirs.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;These reports appear to be more misleading than Enron's financial reports
<br>
were. According to Investor's Business Daily, employees were prevented
<br>
from selling their stock for a period of about 2 weeks in late October
<br>
and early November.
<br>
&nbsp;According to SEC filings (see <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/t/e/ene.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/t/e/ene.html</a>), Enron
<br>
executives stopped selling after August 2 (except for one director - I'm not
<br>
sure whether he's an executive - who sold $39.50 worth of stock on Nov. 28).
<br>
CEO Ken Lay actually bought nearly $2 million worth of stock in August.
<br>
It's possible that the SEC filings are incomplete, but I don't know where
<br>
else the media would get their info about stock sales.
<br>
&nbsp;Prior to August, executives did a lot of selling, but that was also true
<br>
in other companies in industries in which Enron operated (e.g. Calpine),
<br>
so it's hard to tell what role inside info played in motivating the sales.
<br>
The publicly available info about weak energy prices and the faltering
<br>
economy are arguably sufficient to explain much of the sales.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Lay and other executives did not lose money on stock.  They sold early and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made hundreds of millions in profits while investors lost money and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;employees were blocked from selling their stock.  Internal Enron memos show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that executives knew they were &quot;probably&quot; going to have a financial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collapse, and that they were selling their stock, while at the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were predicting massive profits to their employees and encouraging them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to buy even more stock.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;As far as I can tell, executives sold at prices above $40 per share, and
<br>
later urged employees to buy when prices were below $40 per share. I think
<br>
they were irresponsible to urge employees to buy, and it looks like some of
<br>
their accounting practices were improper, but I see no signs that they were
<br>
hypocritical in the way that you imply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This was not a failure of the free market and capitalism.  This company did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not operate under those rules.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;It sounds like you are trying to define the free market as a system of
<br>
rules under which fraud is impossible. The trouble with that is that there
<br>
is no reason to think that such a system can be implemented.
<br>
&nbsp;Fraud has happened under all economic systems that I'm aware of. As far
<br>
as I can tell, our current quasi-free market set up the appropriate
<br>
incentives, Enron and Arthur Andersen executives badly misjudged those
<br>
incentives, and the resulting lawsuits appear likely to bankrupt most of
<br>
them. Arthur Andersen has over 2000 partners who are personally liable
<br>
for any lawsuits the company loses, and have no obvious defense against
<br>
shareholder lawsuits.
<br>
&nbsp;If the economy had continued to grow as nicely as the stock market was
<br>
suggesting two years ago, and energy prices had remained high, the risks
<br>
that Enron took would probably have paid off quite well, and most people who
<br>
noticed the accounting problems would probably have considered them minor.
<br>
&nbsp;Probably a portion of the blame can be laid on the Federal Reserve for
<br>
pumping up the money supply in 1999, and the problems with California's
<br>
electricity regulations may also have destabilized energy markets in ways
<br>
that contributed to Enron's misjudgments, but these are very indirect and
<br>
partial causes of the problem.
<br>
&nbsp;Stock market bubbles seem to be a natural feature of markets, and at their
<br>
peaks lots of people misjudge risks. In market based systems, those people
<br>
get punished fairly quickly, and the misallocation of resources that they
<br>
created gets corrected about as quickly as seems humanly possible. Under
<br>
most non-market systems, the equivalent problem rarely gets corrected or
<br>
punished. When was the last time a government employee lost money for
<br>
persuading taxpayers to finance a boondoggle?

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I suggest doing a google search on &quot;Krugman enron puff&quot; to find some
<br>
of the things Krugman wrote about Enron at around the time he received
<br>
money from Enron.
