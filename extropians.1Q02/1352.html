<p>
As a long-time lurker with a rare few minutes to post, I can't stand by and
<br>
let my gender be, once again, completely slammed in another round of the
<br>
list's recurrent &quot;standards slide&quot; discussion.
<br>
<p>I've had two experiences this year that made me ponder the &quot;are women fit
<br>
to serve?&quot; issue:
<br>
<p>1) I ran the Marine Corps &quot;Mud Run&quot; at Camp Pendleton.  (Basically a fairly
<br>
tough 10K with a smattering of standard &quot;boot camp&quot; obstacles.)  Although I
<br>
consider myself only a &quot;reasonably fit&quot; woman who spends most of her time
<br>
driving a desk, (and I was less than three weeks recovered from abdominal
<br>
surgery), I decided to give it a try.  While certainly the record shows
<br>
that the best times always belong to men, I was shocked at how many male
<br>
Marines I passed by.  Yes, there were certainly many hard-bodies, but there
<br>
were also PLENTY of guys with nothing even close to my leg endurance OR
<br>
UPPER BODY STRENGTH!  I actually had to boost one guy in the butt (Marine,
<br>
NOT civilian) to get him over an obstacle 'cause the lard bucket was
<br>
blocking my way.
<br>
<p>Now perhaps this is all due to &quot;lowered standards on behalf of women,&quot; but
<br>
I suspect it's more a management issue.  I wouldn't be surprised to find
<br>
that data prior to integration show that a fair number of beer drinking,
<br>
chain smoking, chip-eating men slid by under the stated standard.
<br>
Certainly the men I know who served in WWII (and afterwards--when the
<br>
military could afford higher standards), weren't exactly pinnacles of
<br>
physical fitness--I've got pictures of my drinkin' smokin' Granddad and his
<br>
buds to prove it!  All these &quot;substandard&quot; males were sort of ignored until
<br>
women joined and female physical fitness was an easy target for the
<br>
opposition. Except for the most elite units, I expect that the majority of
<br>
male soldiers do about the same, both emotionally and physically, as the
<br>
majority of their female counterparts--I heard plenty of wheezing and
<br>
whining from Marines of BOTH genders out on the 10K course.   I'm skeptical
<br>
that the &quot;psychologically and physically unfit&quot; problem originated with the
<br>
introduction of women.
<br>
<p>(To give credit where due,  I also saw some awesome athletic
<br>
performances--again from Marines of both genders.  There were men who could
<br>
vault over a six-feet fence like it wasn't there, and women who could
<br>
slither better than snakes under wire strung 6-inches above mud-pits.  Both
<br>
seemed to do well on hills--men made better time when the surfaces were dry
<br>
and packed, but on the hill that was drenched by a fire hose, the women
<br>
climbed faster on the rough, slippery surface.)  
<br>
<p>2) I went to the Cu Chi tunnels in Vietnam.  While I certainly felt
<br>
claustrophobic, I could pass through all the tunnels in the exhibit (both
<br>
kinds--those in their original condition, and those widened for
<br>
Westerners).  My companion, (a military officer), however, needed to exit
<br>
at the first opportunity.  He's in seriously good shape, but the downside
<br>
of all that muscle bulk is that it made navigating through small dark
<br>
spaces pretty terrifying.  He was in no danger of getting stuck, but his
<br>
size made the situation very stressful.  The guide, a former North
<br>
Vietnamese commander, said he was &quot;glad they hadn't sent women&quot; down as
<br>
&quot;tunnel rats&quot; during the war.  He also commented that some of their booby
<br>
traps (those that would let their own soldiers pass) could likely have been
<br>
circumvented by Western females.  So, it seems there's at least one &quot;real
<br>
world combat&quot; example where women could have served better than men.
<br>
<p>Also interesting is the fact that the North Vietnamese are very proud of
<br>
their female soldiers.  (I saw three memorials to women and females appear
<br>
prominently in the films and photo displays at several war museums.)  They
<br>
regard women as excellent fighters, and this in a society that otherwise
<br>
looks down on women.  The female soldiers probably weren't physically
<br>
strong, but apparently they were brave, determined, able to work alone,
<br>
stealthy, and well suited to sneaking through the jungle.  In short, they
<br>
were very well equipped for modern guerilla warfare.  The women also seemed
<br>
to have worked just fine next to men in very close quarters and under very
<br>
rough combat conditions.  From what I gather, a lot of those &quot;psychological
<br>
and sexual tension&quot; issues disappear when everyone's in serious danger.
<br>
Perhaps the &quot;issues&quot; during the Gulf War were due to the fact that most
<br>
soldiers were bored and NOT under sustained dire threat.  Maybe there was
<br>
too much slack time that allowed for fooling around and better military
<br>
management could eliminate the problem.
<br>
<p>I don't intend any of these comments as arguments in favor of &quot;lowered
<br>
standards&quot; for women or as negations of the existence of &quot;special
<br>
treatment&quot; in certain circumstances for women.  However, &quot;special
<br>
treatment&quot; exists for guys too in the form of &quot;old boy's&quot; networks that let
<br>
unqualified males slide by.  Let's get rid of ALL of it.  As a taxpayer
<br>
supporting the military, and as a citizen in need of protection, I'd like
<br>
to see standards set strictly on objective job requirements and I'd like to
<br>
see those standards applied equally to all men and women.  If people are
<br>
needed for hand-to-hand combat, large fit men will probably serve best.  If
<br>
people are needed to quietly crawl under bushes or fences or wiggle down
<br>
tunnels, maybe the job should go to some small, limber women.  I don't want
<br>
to throw out potentially beneficial skill sets because our military can't
<br>
figure out how to accomplish what apparently was accomplished by the
<br>
winners of the Vietnam war.  Men and women in Vietnam appear to have the
<br>
same biological desires and sexual tensions as Westerners, but they managed
<br>
to use everyone who could help them--no yowling around about &quot;biology&quot; or
<br>
&quot;social custom&quot; or  &quot;women detracting from men's performance.&quot;  Perhaps we
<br>
have the luxury of saying women are simply too &quot;problematic in service&quot;
<br>
because we haven't faced enough of a threat to really take the matter
<br>
seriously--we haven't had to leverage absolutely every bit of available
<br>
talent.  I hope we never confront such a formidable enemy; it sounds like
<br>
our social, sexual, and philosophical sensitivities might limit us to a
<br>
half-strength response. 
<br>
<p>As a final note...the equal and rational application of standards would
<br>
likely result in a great reduction in the number of women qualifying for
<br>
traditional combat, and a great reduction in the number of men meeting the
<br>
standards for submarine service and the ASTRONUAT PROGRAM.   Aside from a
<br>
few jokes about Minsky's comment, and Spike's &quot;legless woman&quot; proposal, I
<br>
see numerous outraged postings about sloppy performance by women in jobs
<br>
they shouldn't hold, but I see scant outrage on the list about &quot;standards
<br>
slide&quot; when it comes to men.  Why not?  As forced taxpayers, we certainly
<br>
get stuck with the bill for both classes of substandard performance.
<br>
(Also, fixing the space program might be an easier first step than fixing
<br>
the military...)
<br>
<p>Stir, Stir...
