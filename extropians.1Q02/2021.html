I'd like to make a toast to Max More who has been a generous and welcoming contributor to our culture.
<br>
<p>I am amazed at how Max keeps his focus on the big transhumanist picture -- the long term, the never-ending desire to see transhumanity grow and prosper, and the immediate issues that face our culture and our world.  Not only has his instinctive intellection broadened the scope of what people deem as possible, he takes it a step further by shedding light on the many of the concerns and unanswered questions of those with whom he comes in contact.
<br>
<p>I hope that we all become wiser by knowing Max.  I hope we become more loving and compassionate people having met Max.  I hope that we become yet more critical and scrutinizing in our acceptance of facts and the world around us and give to one another our gifts of questioning and wonder.
<br>
<p>Now, &quot;[h]ere's to plain speaking and clear understanding&quot; (Bogart) --
<br>
<p>May your life be a life and a merry one!
<br>
<p>Happy Birthday!
<br>
<p>Natasha
