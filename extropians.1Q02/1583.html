<em>&gt; Which (in an attempt to make this thread extropianism relevant) brings up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the interesting issue of what an extropian health care system would involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how to bring it about. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clearly the current systems, both the heavily socialized ones in Sweden and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Norway, and the far less socialized US system, are suboptimal in many ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both at providing desired care and in the forms of care we as transhumanists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to have. It would useful to identify the basic assumptions (like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only supplying 'health', not improvement, and that 'health' is the same for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody) made that make them diverge from what we want, and the practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation issues that mess things up (ranging from public choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects leading to bloated bureaucracies to organisational structures that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote an operational rather than humanistic view of patients).
</em><br>
<p>It's important also to bear in mind Robin Hanson's criticisms of the
<br>
notion that &quot;health care&quot; actually improves health in any way.  He pointed
<br>
to studies showing that providing unlimited health care benefits to
<br>
individuals actually did not improve objective measures of health other
<br>
than some minor things like getting their teeth fixed.  They didn't live
<br>
longer, they didn't get sick any less, they didn't have better quality
<br>
of life.  Robin also argued that the enhancements in health and longevity
<br>
over the past century do not correlate clearly with the advances in
<br>
medicine which are often credited with the improvements.  Places with
<br>
the newest technology and rapid adoption of new health treatments do
<br>
not generally have healthier people than more backwards regions (this
<br>
is within the U.S. I think).
<br>
<p>I really miss Robin's absence from the list.  I know it is not polite
<br>
to say so, but I would gladly give up JR's 50 posts a week for one of
<br>
Robin's.
<br>
