<em>&gt; &gt; It's a fascinating process, the aging of stars. You start off fusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hydrogen to helium in the core. Then you run out of hydrogen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the fusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moves to an expanding shell. The inner helium core grows and collapses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without the sustaining radiation pressure of fusion reactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until it gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hot and dense enough to ignite. Which it does pretty much all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at once. Bang!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Helium fusion generates much more energy, so the star expands to a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equilibrium. Now you have a helium fusing core surrounded by a hydrogen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fusing shell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Later on, you start to run out of helium, and build up a carbon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core. So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; start have a shell of helium fusion and a shell of hydrogen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fusion outside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As the core gets larger, it collapses until it ignites with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carbon fusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bang!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The process of getting from a helium core ignition to a carbon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core ignition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is somewhat faster than getting a helium core ignition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what happens during planetary formation when a dozen or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planetesimals get chucked into the sun by orbital resonances? Doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the addition of preexisting heavy elements tend to spike the cocktail of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stellar development?
</em><br>
<p>Not noticably. Planetesimals tend are either jupiter-types (in which case,
<br>
they're more or less exactly the same composition as the star), or they're
<br>
too small to matter. (The sun right now is about 99% of the mass of the
<br>
solar system; the rest is pretty much all gas giants). Anything heavier than
<br>
carbon is really very rare by mass in the solar system.
<br>
<p>(Note that 1 Jupiter = 318 Earths, and 1000 Jupiters = 1 Sun, more or less).
<br>
<p>If you want to do the math, consider that the cloud that collapsed to form
<br>
the solar system is homogenous (or as near as matters) in elemental makeup &amp;
<br>
figure from there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, I haven't heard you or anyone speak to Jeff's earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculation that there was something like 535 Earth masses of iron in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Sun, based on the 0.15% iron content in the solar corona. Is this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate? If so, how does the presence of this amount of iron (and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other metals) spike the Sun's development?
</em><br>
<p>The sun is 330,000 times as massive as the earth, give or take. 0.15% of
<br>
that is considerably more that 535 earth masses, but 0.15% is the correct
<br>
mass fraction.
<br>
<p>Metals make stars smaller and last longer is the short answer. Metals add
<br>
opacity to plasma way out of proportion to their absolute mass fraction,
<br>
meaning there is a stronger coupling between radiation and matter in the
<br>
star, leading to larger stars being much more unstable or not forming in the
<br>
first place. If you remove all the metals from the mix, you get monsterously
<br>
huge stars (up to 1000 solar masses or more) that go supernova a million
<br>
years after forming.
<br>
<p>The heavier metals in the sun are evenly distributed, although I think
<br>
there's a little more carbon, nitrogen, oxygen in the core. I don't recall.
<br>
<p>The good thing about this sort of stuff is it reminds me to take everything
<br>
said on this list on topics I don't actually know much about with a healthy
<br>
dose of salt.
