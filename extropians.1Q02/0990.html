<p><p>In my not-so-long-ago educational past the actual case was that most parents
<br>
of all economic strata paid for their children's education.  I was one of
<br>
the few poor saps whose parents weren't paying for my education, which kind
<br>
of works against you since the system operates under the assumption that
<br>
your parents will be paying since most do.  I don't see where the system
<br>
needs to be fixed, beyond changing things a bit so people whose parents
<br>
aren't paying for their education don't get hosed.  As far as I can tell,
<br>
the only people who really lose out under the current system are people who
<br>
neither have someone to pay for their education nor qualify for one of the
<br>
myriad of special exceptions and aid programs that basically ignore
<br>
otherwise ordinary non-minority folk such as myself.
