<em>&gt; Enron, Spawn of Business Journalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Gary North
</em><br>
<p>It's hard for me to get past Gary North's name in judging this article.
<br>
For those who have forgotten, North was the single loudest voice in
<br>
predicting Y2K apocalypse.  He predicted absolute disaster, starvation
<br>
and death throughout the entire world, with complete certainty.  His web
<br>
site had thousands of documents, each with his own pessimistic commentary,
<br>
selected to drive home the point that we were headed for an inevitable
<br>
and unstoppable catastrophe.  Of course he turned out to be absolutely
<br>
wrong, and he disappeared for quite a while after that, but apparently
<br>
he is now starting to show his head again.
<br>
<p>So Gary North does not have much credibility with me.  Should I bother
<br>
to read his article, given his track record of being not just wrong on an
<br>
important issue, but being flagrantly, obnoxiously, infuriatingly wrong?
<br>
Here is where the ad hominen fallacy raises its head.  Usually it is
<br>
used as a debating tactic.  But the real point is that it can be an
<br>
error in our own thinking.  Should we reject possibly-valid analysis and
<br>
information just because of flaws in the source?  On the one hand, we
<br>
do need filters; we can't read everything that is written by the entire
<br>
human race.  But on the other hand, we risk filtering out useful data.
<br>
<p>In any case, I read the article, and while it is not badly written, in
<br>
fact I don't agree with most of it.  However the errors that I see are
<br>
not blatant and some of what North says seems correct.  Errors include
<br>
his conclusion that Enron and the dot-com debacle disprove the efficient
<br>
market hypothesis, and that the Enron failure is largely due to government
<br>
subsidies.  I agree that the story does illustrate groupthink among
<br>
journalists and investors, but IMO that is not newsworthy analysis.
<br>
<p>I think the core of the Enron story is and will be that the people
<br>
entrusted with management defrauded the investors.  This is a constant
<br>
problem in the capitalist world, at all scales.  Each of us puts our
<br>
savings into other people's hands, meaning that we have to trust them.
<br>
And such trust is risky.  Every day people lose money because they are
<br>
cheated by people they trusted.
<br>
<p>In business, the issue is whether the management truly represents the
<br>
interests of the owners, the stockholders.  Every company is aware
<br>
of this risk.  The entire structure of the business firm is set up to
<br>
try to minimize this problem.  It's similar to cancer in an organism,
<br>
where a part of the whole decides to advance its own interests at the
<br>
expense of the larger body.  Biological organisms have defense in depth
<br>
against cancers, but sometimes those defenses fail.  In the same way,
<br>
firms have all kinds of checks and balances to try to keep individuals
<br>
from enriching themselves at the expense of the business.  But these
<br>
aren't perfect either.
<br>
<p>In the case of Enron, I believe the evidence indicates that this is what
<br>
happened, that the managers looked after their own interests rather than
<br>
those of the company's owners whose investments they were supposed to
<br>
be protecting.  The use of complex financial structures defeated the
<br>
checks and balances; no one could tell where the money was going, so it
<br>
was too tempting to direct it into their own pockets.
<br>
<p>Enron, in fact, was killed by cancer.  (Technically it's not quite dead
<br>
yet; it is dying of cancer.)  It's newsworthy, because it doesn't happen
<br>
often to businesses at this scale.  But the real lesson is that investors
<br>
need to be aware of this new risk.  They need to make sure that their
<br>
managers are not in a position to cheat the company through the use
<br>
of complex financial instruments.  The use of derivatives and swaps
<br>
can be profitable, but unless there is effective auditing in place,
<br>
the business is risking its own life in using these instruments.
<br>
Investors need to think of derivatives as carcinogenic stimulants.
<br>
They produce short term benefits but can lead to long term destruction.
<br>
<p>IMO the Enron bankruptcy does not show the need for more government
<br>
supervision, or fewer government subsidies, or most of the other
<br>
lessons people are trying to draw.  It shows the need for investors to
<br>
be more careful.  It shows a failure of one of the main limits against
<br>
corruption, the use of independenet auditors.  Investors will want to
<br>
protect themselves by insisting that their employees, the managers,
<br>
hire auditors who have no financial incentive to cheat the investors
<br>
whom they are supposedly protecting.
<br>
<p>These are the kinds of lessons which Enron teaches, and they are exactly
<br>
the kinds of lessons which the capitalist system excels at learning.
<br>
Even without any regulatory changes, Enron will lead to a new awareness
<br>
of risk, and new techniques to manage it.  The end result will be a
<br>
system which is more robust and more able to fight the cancers which
<br>
constantly threaten business survival.
