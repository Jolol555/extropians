She had a real &quot;see it to believe it&quot; attitude! lol  I am going to have to get her reading Drexler's stuff!

</em><br>
<p>I have a prediction--you will pay in 2030.  
<br>
<p>Man, that's only 28 years from now! 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Think about how different the world was 28 years ago:  actually, it
<br>
was pretty much the same...the year was 1974.  
<br>
<p>Transportation was pretty much the same.  Except cars get more gas per
<br>
mile, and are more powerful and efficient.
<br>
<p>Medicine was pretty much the same--people died of cancer and heart
<br>
disease at pretty much the same rates.  Older people were generally
<br>
more lucid, however, probably due to the fact that there were fewer
<br>
mind fogging drugs for them to take--although they do generally live a
<br>
bit longer, I have noticed....but not all that much longer
<br>
<p>The world is definitely more polluted.  The beaches in Texas are an
<br>
absolute mess compared to what they were 28 years ago....The Gulf of
<br>
Mexico is now your basic latrine...oh well, someone will no doubt drag
<br>
out the old cliche that the Potomac is less polluted today (geez, try
<br>
thinking for yourself ocassionally; maybe that's b/c all the industry
<br>
is gone from the northeast...)
<br>
<p>Yes, there are some substantial advances, especially in electronics
<br>
and chemistry...and other INCREMENTAL engineering advances.
<br>
<p>The biggest change between now and 1974 is that there are a lot more
<br>
people here in the USA, the better to turn our lakes and rivers into
<br>
latrines.....and that might help bring nanotech closer if only a bunch
<br>
of those people were working research scientists. But they aint,
<br>
John...most of these new people are busboys and janitors, and guess
<br>
what--they don't know squat about nanotech!
<br>
<p>Nanotech will probably get here.  But the date will be a helluva lot
<br>
closer to 280 years than to  28 years.  And you will be DEAD by
<br>
then---and not frozen-dead, either---dead-dead...cuz you aint signed
<br>
up for cryonics, are you? Well, you better get signed up, bud....
