</em><br>

<em>&gt;A decentralized peer-to-peer system has its own many problems of

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt;You need real goods beyond entertainment items that are produced within

<p>I agree with your c) option.  A virtual nation (VN) or virtual community 
<br>
(VC) *might* be one way to do that on a larger than personal scale.  I'm 
<br>
not fully convinced of this yet.
<br>
<p>One problem I see is that a game universe is populated by those *with* a 
<br>
&quot;like mind&quot;, i.e. they want to play the game.  A virtual nation wouldn't 
<br>
have that any more than a real nation does.  You'd have conflicting 
<br>
desires, attitudes and varying capabilities and resources and the end 
<br>
result would a duplicate of the real world - a Darwinian competition with 
<br>
losers and winners.  One interesting question would be:  would the nature 
<br>
of the VN change the nature of the winners - i.e., would Transhumanists 
<br>
tend to be the winners if they built the VN?
<br>
<p>Reason's basic problem is he assumes you need a &quot;fairly large number of 
<br>
potentially right-minded people&quot;.  I'm not convinced there is such a 
<br>
number.  I suspect &quot;true&quot; Transhumanists (or even sympathizers) are less 
<br>
than one percent of the population.
<br>
<p>I would like Reason to detail how the Everquest people are doing 
<br>
black-market economics in the real world.
<br>
<p>See my reply to Reason on Hakim Bey's (Peter Lamborn Wilson) &quot;T.A.Z.&quot; 
<br>
(Temporary Autonomous Zones) - a similar concept.  I wonder if Wilson has 
<br>
considered MMORPGs.
<br>
<p>The problems with Reason's notion that the game could be designed to 
<br>
support a lib development is simply that the game rules can be subverted, 
<br>
hacked, or - if irritating enough to enough people - simply abandoned.  The 
<br>
more the game must approximate the real world, the less likely the game 
<br>
world can control real-world behavior *in* in the game.
<br>
<p>I agree with you that it need to be more than just &quot;fun&quot;.  But &quot;fun&quot; 
<br>
shouldn't be ignored.  How about a game where sex and its pursuit and 
<br>
satisfaction was a factor.  THAT might bring in a LOT of people and be VERY 
<br>
profitable - and influential as well in altering attitudes.  That would 
<br>
attract state oppression, of course, but the state's inability to control 
<br>
the 15 million or so porn sites bodes ill for their suppressing a virtual 
<br>
&quot;Sex World&quot; - especially if the system were as distributed as the Internet 
<br>
is and more so using encryption, peer-to-peer technology, etc.
<br>
<p>As for bandwidth, that's coming, if more slowly than originally 
<br>
expected.  As for computation needs,. you have Linux Beowulf cluster 
<br>
technology - free and effective and a way to use those 300 million obsolete 
<br>
PCs we read about.  A peer-to-peer network of Beowulf clusters and more 
<br>
work on true distributed processing might produce enough power to run a VN 
<br>
or VC with some security.  In any event, in ten to twenty years, the 
<br>
computing power will be here.  Intel is predicting 20GHz PCs within the 
<br>
next three years...
<br>
<p>I agree with Reason that a Singularity is unlikely within five years.  I 
<br>
give it a minimum of twenty years and don't really expect it until around 
<br>
2050 give or take ten years.
<br>
<p>As to products produced in such a v-space, again virtual sex must lead the 
<br>
way as it has on the Net.  Again as indicated above, this leads to 
<br>
suppression, but the question remains:  how effective a suppression?
