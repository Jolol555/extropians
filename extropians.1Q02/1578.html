<p><em>&gt;Hitting bottom offers the best chance to quit, because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generally is accompanied by enough pain that the negative feedback
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starts to exceed the positive feedback.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in fact modern treatment programs encourage people not to
<br>
&quot;rescue&quot; an alcoholic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Some individuals can quit anytime, generally when it's still in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the repetitive social habit stage. Such individuals generally are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather control-oriented and resent their bodies trying to order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them what to do. AA'ers typically call people who quit without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program as 'white knucklers', and I've known a number of control
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freaks who went that route. Makes them even bigger a$$holes than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were before.
</em><br>
<p>Many can quit in stage I if they see the problem, Stage II is much
<br>
harder and Stage III the failure rate is staggering. A latter stage
<br>
III is what most people see as an alcoholic.
<br>
<p>I was trying to put to rest some common misconceptions about
<br>
alcoholism.
<br>
<p>It is still a pretty common misconception amongst the general
<br>
public that the reason that people become alcoholics is because of
<br>
a moral deficiency.
<br>
<p>The fact is that roughly about 10% of the population is born with
<br>
a genetically determined and different biochemistry that leaves
<br>
them predisposed to alcohol abuse and possible alcoholism.
<br>
<p>Alcohol affects these people differently and much more powerfully
<br>
than people born without this biochemistry. They become addicted in
<br>
much the same way cigarette smokers do.
<br>
<p>It is important to understand a problem in order to correct it.
<br>
<p>Since we now know it to be genetic and biochemical in nature, The
<br>
hope this will someday lead to a cure, but for now there is only
<br>
one treatment. They have to stop drinking.
<br>
<p>A very good book on all of this:

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guide to the myths and realities of alcoholism
<br>
