<p>Miriam and Robert are quite likely both incorrect.
<br>
<p>(Someone has to say these things, might as well be me. It's my purpose,
<br>
after all.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The primary purpose of life is to survive.  The secondary purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to evolve (or become extinct).
</em><br>
<p>The second sentence requires a pre-Darwinian metaphysics: evolution *per
<br>
se* as teleological. If it *were* so, then punctuated equilibrium (say)
<br>
would not be an observed fact of biological history. Every species would
<br>
have its mutation checkers and repair systems turned down to the very
<br>
lowest set point compatible with individuals surviving barely long enough
<br>
to reproduce and aid offspring (if that is beneficial). Indeed, we'd
<br>
probably find copious programming designed to modify the genome as greatly
<br>
as possible in each generation. I don't think that's a good description of
<br>
current life on earth, even if some bacteria approach it.
<br>
<p>The first sentence is dubious in both philosophical and Darwinian terms;
<br>
`life' is a hypostatization, a reification, and is not the kind of entity
<br>
that can have a purpose; but if `it' did, then the purpose would inhere in
<br>
individual constellations of genes which are the only units that survive
<br>
for any length of time. But this assertion is already dubious in turn, as
<br>
any simple mantra has to be, given the shocking re-entrant complexity of
<br>
reality.
