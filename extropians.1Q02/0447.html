<p>
Amara,
<br>
<p>Thanks for sharing your interpretation.
<br>
<p>For the record :
<br>
<p>I've checked the context : there is none. The text of that book makes
<br>
perfect sense in general, but this is in a special section called
<br>
&quot;Maxims and interludes&quot;, which is all made of very short paragraphs,
<br>
often quite elliptic. A note in my edition says that it was in fact
<br>
written several years before the rest, so it wasn't written as part of
<br>
the book and was added there afterwards. So it may, or may not, relate
<br>
to the particular ideas expressed in the rest of the book.
<br>
<p>I find your interpretation surprising, because you suggest that this
<br>
&quot;abyss gazing into you&quot; be something positive, while the whole
<br>
paragraph seems to suggest the opposite :
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;He who fights monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monster. And if thou gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gaze into thee&quot;
</em><br>
<p>If the second sentence is a kind of rephrasing of the first (which I
<br>
think it is), then for the abyss to gaze into you seems to be compared
<br>
to becoming a monster, something one should be &quot;careful&quot; to avoid. My
<br>
take would be that it refers to a kind of &quot;discipline&quot; or &quot;warning&quot; he
<br>
is giving to himself, that he should avoid a particular personal risk
<br>
linked to his research.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Jacques

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Followed to its logical extreme, one concludes if the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;closed, we have been here before, having this exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;discussion. Furthermore we have been here an *infinite* number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;times before. Still further, we will be here again, having this exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;discussion and an unimaginably large number of similar but slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;different versions thereof. Thinking about it causes one to zone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;out. Amara has so aptly described the feeling as staring into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;abyss until it stares back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I borrowed the expression from Nietzche, although our context was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;He who fights monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monster. And if thou gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gaze into thee&quot;    _Beyond Good and Evil_  Nietzsche
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't read _Beyond Good and Evil_, but he uses the abyss often in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his writings, and he has a fondness for this particular state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind. See _Thus Spake Zarathustra_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://eserver.org/philosophy/nietzsche-zarathustra.txt">http://eserver.org/philosophy/nietzsche-zarathustra.txt</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche was also a little bit insane, but then ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I prefer to be only slightly insane. (Don't we all?)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  --Characters Captain Sheridan and Garabaldi on Babylon 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see my special quotes <a href="http://www.amara.com/aboutme/favquotes.html">http://www.amara.com/aboutme/favquotes.html</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My context for the abyss is close to the Zen practices and their use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the deep abyss. The deep abyss is that psychological place where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no support, no nothing, a complete free-fall, and you realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no one is going to save you but yourself. It can be a terrifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realization, and it might require sitting there for a while and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run away from yourself, in other words: 'having a tea with yourself'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (my context of staring into the abyss). However, once one realizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are all they have, then the abyss is a very rich place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plant seeds of yourself to grow.  Then what comes of that abyss is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone/something genuine and an integrated whole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually everyone has that psychological place of the deep abyss, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would guess that many people don't notice because their lives have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many kinds of supports and distractions.
