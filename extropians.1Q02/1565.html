<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Alcoholism is not a genetic predisposition to addictive behavior,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is a genetic predisposition to a substance. Once addicted to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; substance it is not easy to quit, but I agree it is essential.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But, the primary question is, CAN a person DECIDE to quit, or do they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no control over their actions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, they can given enough of a major hitting bottom (usually)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and given a lot of willpower and support to stay on the wagon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had a few people in my life go through it.  It isn't easy.
</em><br>
<p>Hitting bottom offers the best chance to quit, because it generally is
<br>
accompanied by enough pain that the negative feedback starts to exceed
<br>
the positive feedback.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But no, the above is not the &quot;primary&quot; question if you think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that it is all a moral question or primarily one.  It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit more complicated than that.
</em><br>
<p>Some individuals can quit anytime, generally when it's still in the
<br>
repetetive social habit stage. Such individuals generally are rather
<br>
control-oriented and resent their bodies trying to order them what to
<br>
do. AA'ers typically call people who quit without a program as 'white
<br>
knucklers', and I've known a number of control freaks who went that
<br>
route. Makes them even bigger a$$holes than they were before.
<br>
<p>Food addiction, I think, though, is the most difficult addiction to
<br>
kick, because you can't be a teetotaler from food. You HAVE to learn to
<br>
be a moderate consumer of food, since you can't live without it, which
<br>
is far more difficult than a regieme of strict avoidance. Furthermore,
<br>
the cravings for food don't even have to be present, simply a
<br>
manipulative subconcious is required, which drives you to have just 'a
<br>
few more bites' at each meal. This is, I think, why there are far more
<br>
obese people than alcoholics, and why far more repeatedly fail at
<br>
dieting than any other addiction kicking program..
