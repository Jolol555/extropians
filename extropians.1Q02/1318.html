<p>
A fairly good editorial by Paul Krugman in the NY Times
<br>
today about &quot;A System Corrupted&quot; regarding the Enron affair.
<br>
<p>See:
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/opinion/18KRUG.html?pagewanted=print">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/opinion/18KRUG.html?pagewanted=print</a>
<br>
<p>A really interesting contrast to an extropic perspective
<br>
where you want to keep taking backward steps until you
<br>
have sufficient perspective to begin to see where to
<br>
turn the control knobs to try and maximize technology
<br>
development, lifespan extension, personal survival, etc.
<br>
Those people who had their pension funds invested in Enron
<br>
stock have suffered a significant reduction in survival
<br>
potential.  It is perhaps a lesson in &quot;trusting the system&quot; --
<br>
there will always be people who attempt to take advantage of that.
<br>
<p>The system clearly needs fixing.  One needs protection
<br>
of executives, accounting firms, etc. who are operating
<br>
in the best interests of investors (or society) [interesting
<br>
problems develop when the investors' best interests are
<br>
incompatible with those of society] and at the same time
<br>
have clear recourse for investors to seek compensation from
<br>
individuals who are clever enough to abuse the system.
<br>
<p>It begs some really fundamental questions along the personal
<br>
freedom, self-development vectors.  Should people be allowed
<br>
to develop to the level where they can intentionally take
<br>
advantage of the current environment?  Should one be able
<br>
to engineer children with an average height of 7'6&quot; who
<br>
become star basketball players.  Is it fair to force the
<br>
adaptation of the luddites to the longevists perspective?
<br>
[The longevists presumably become richer and richer while
<br>
the luddites keep getting set back to ground zero due to
<br>
the learning period that children require.  Failing to
<br>
adapt essentially dooms one to extinction.]
<br>
