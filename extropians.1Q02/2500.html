</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Interesting phenomenon.  The other obvious question is, even if the
<br>
retina can tell that the image is out of focus, how does it know whether
<br>
the focal plane is in front of or behind the retina?  In other words,
<br>
how does it know which way to grow in order to correct the problem?
<br>
That sounds even harder than determining whether the image is in focus
<br>
or not.
<br>
<p>I wonder if they are barking up the wrong tree, and it is a signal from
<br>
the lens that does the trick, maybe some subtle chemical wafting through
<br>
the vitreous humor.
<br>
<p>### The retina contains a number of other types of cells in addition to the
<br>
ganglion cells - such as the bipolar and amacrine cells (many types).
<br>
Apparently, muscarinic cholinergic activity is needed in the regulation of
<br>
ocular growth, but the exact pathways are not known (the cholinergic
<br>
amacrines are not its source). Other amacrines (with opiate and dopaminergic
<br>
receptrors) are apparently involved, as well as the activity of bFGF-2, VIP,
<br>
and possibly other signals. Even with all ganglion cells gone there is
<br>
enough circuitry in the retina for an edge detection algorith to hide in.
<br>
<p>As far as I know the developing eye does not &quot;know&quot; if the retina is behind
<br>
or in front of the focal plane. However, by default the fetal eye is shorter
<br>
than it should be, so the focal plane is behind the retina. The eye keeps
<br>
growing until the image gets in focus, and then stops. If for some reason
<br>
this sharp image does not form, as in partial visual deprivation, or when
<br>
the signal from edge detection is not properly received by sclerocytes,
<br>
growth continues well beyond the optimal setpoint, resulting in worsening
<br>
nearsightedness. As far as I know there is no signal to shorten the eye,
<br>
only modulation of its growth rate.
