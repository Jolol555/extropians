This is so-oo depressing.  Like, how many times do we have to keep re-inventing the wheel?  
<br>
<p>Ayn Rand covered this topic rather well, I thought, and I would have assumed that as astute a group as extropians would surely have absorbed at least the basics of Rand's thought with their mother's milk.
<br>
<p>Briefly, the question &quot;what is the purpose of life,&quot; contains an error of category.  Things only HAVE purposes TO living entities.  Purpose to WHOM and FOR WHAT????  Purpose only has meaning with regard to a living entity.  To ask then - what is the purpose of LIFE? - is meaningless.  LIFE creates and identifies purposes.  (This does not mean, however, that all purposes are equally valid.  Life itself - and each living entity - has a specific identity.)
<br>
<p>Outside of life, what could it possibly mean for something to have a purpose?  (Mind you, I'm not restricting &quot;life&quot; to a simple-minded CHO/DNA model.  Any entity which has a certain set of system properties potentially qualifies, including virtual models - eg., uploads.  As Rand put it, life is a process of self-generated and self-sustaining action.  But that's not an exhaustive definition, and without further explication of the term &quot;action,&quot; as opposed to simple motion, as well as the concept of a &quot;process,&quot; there are still vast potential epistemological pitfalls.)
<br>
<p>It is the lack of precision in terms such as &quot;life,&quot; &quot;process,&quot; &quot;action,&quot; &quot;value,&quot; &quot;purpose,&quot; &quot;moral,&quot; &quot;ethical,&quot; and a host of similar or related concepts (and include &quot;concept,&quot; or course) which enables these endless meandering, largely purposeless opinionfests.  Rand by no means completed the job of clarification of these issues, but I suggest that those who are seriously interested in discovering useful knowledge take a look at what she did accomplish.  It can really help clear out some of the fog.
