<p>
This is mostly a non-issue from a scientific standpoint, but is strongly
<br>
influenced by economic and manufacturing technology constraints.  Back in the
<br>
days when the fastest computers were hand-made by the Ladies of Chippewa Falls,
<br>
all computing was expensive and it was generally true that a computer with a
<br>
price tag five times higher was more than five times faster.  Thus, it was
<br>
better to get the faster serial machine than to try to put together groups of
<br>
slower machines.
<br>
<p>Things changed when the single chip beat anything you could put together form
<br>
logic parts, in both speed and cost.  So now, at a price less than most cars,
<br>
you can buy the fastest processor that can be made.  Having reached this point,
<br>
although it would be better to have a processor five times faster than five of
<br>
these, there is no such thing, so to get the performance advance one has to go
<br>
to parallel arrays or clusters.
<br>
<p>I usually advise folks working on research to pick a problem that will fit on
<br>
today's single processor.  Then, after spending a couple of years getting to
<br>
understand what they are doing, buy the next computer.  IMHO a current P4 box
<br>
has the processing power to do significant AI, if we just knew how to write, or
<br>
grow, the code.  As John C. pointed out, if you want it to be self-aware, be
<br>
sure to put in that code module.
<br>
<p>Special purpose hardware for computing has usually been an economic failure.
<br>
This is because of the exponential increase in general computing power allowing
<br>
folks to do in software today that which special hardware did two years ago.
<br>
Over the years I have watched this happen in several areas, but the first time
<br>
was back in the early 70's.  I was working at a company that did image
<br>
processing, and had developed a special parallel logic processor that could do
<br>
high speed operations on pictures, it was called the Binary Image Processor, or
<br>
BIP.  The BIP was the size of a refrigerator and made of first generation high
<br>
power TTL, and cost a great deal of money to develop and build.  It was quite
<br>
useful in optical character recognition, which is where the company expected to
<br>
get a market.  (We liked it because you could run 100 x 100 Conway's Life on it
<br>
and watch it in fast real time.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;However, to use the BIP you needed a PDP-10 to talk to it, and associated
<br>
scanners and displays, so it was all very expensive.  One day, a guy came over
<br>
from marketing and showed us a print out from a potential customer where someone
<br>
had written a BIP simulation from our published papers, and in software, their
<br>
CDC-7600 could out BIP the BIP. (sigh)
<br>
<p>I started out in hardware, and built circuits with some of the first
<br>
commercially available transistors, then ICs, then uPs, but I have learned that
<br>
software is always cleaning up behind you, and if you can't keep ahead, it will
<br>
remove your economic reason to be.  The only things I know you can do in
<br>
hardware that cannot be done algorithmically, are to generate a truly random
<br>
number, or to use quantum entanglement.  But in the future, I expect these to be
<br>
common processor functions, so the software will just have to ask for them.
