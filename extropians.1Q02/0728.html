<em>&gt; &gt; Regarding a cooling/collapse problem resulting from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iron core, or a core with a substantial iron fraction:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is currently accepted that iron lies at the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minimum for nuclear binding energy based on nucleon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number. Thus, as Anders states, moving away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; energy minimum by transmuting iron into either heavier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or lighter elements would be an energy absorbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process.  However, as an alternative, might not this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process tend toward a steady reversibilty, with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equilibrium condition established where there was no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ongoing loss of energy to nucleosynthesis?  Wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it likely be the case that the energy would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systematically lost, but only stored temporarily in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elements with a distribution of nucleon numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; centered around iron, and a correlated distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; binding energies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The binding energy curve has a quadratic minimum around iron, so energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storage is unlikely. I haven't done the math (and I'm neither an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astrophysicist or skilled in statistical mechanics) but the chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equilibrium seems heavily iron-tilted. I think this is studied in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; textbooks in stellar astrophysics.
</em><br>
<p>The energy you get from fusing elements or fissioning elements is the
<br>
difference in the binding energy between the reactants and the products.
<br>
Binding energy is a measure of how stable an element is -- more binding
<br>
energy is required to bind less stable atomic nuclei. Iron has the most
<br>
stable atomic nucleus (ignoring neutron stars, that is, but I digress), and
<br>
therefore the least binding energy. Anything you do with iron, fission or
<br>
fusion, means you put have to put energy into the process.
<br>
<p>Anything lighter than iron has methods of fusion that lead to a release of
<br>
energy; fission requires energy. Anything heaver than iron has methods of
<br>
fission that lead to a release of energy; fusion requires energy.
<br>
<p>(And I'm ignoring isotopes, but never mind; the rule still holds for them).
<br>
<p><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/17940/texts/binding_energy/binding_energy.html">http://library.thinkquest.org/17940/texts/binding_energy/binding_energy.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Wouldn't the current empirical evidence of a stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sun  suggest just such a condition of stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equilibrium, with equal numbers of nuclei transmuting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; away from and then back to iron?  I base this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supposition on the (thermodynamic?) principle that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems tend toward their energy minimums.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the sun isn't an equilibrium system, it is very much an open system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - fuel is consumed and heat radiated away.
</em><br>
<p>It's a fascinating process, the aging of stars. You start off fusing
<br>
hydrogen to helium in the core. Then you run out of hydrogen, and the fusing
<br>
moves to an expanding shell. The inner helium core grows and collapses
<br>
without the sustaining radiation pressure of fusion reactions until it gets
<br>
hot and dense enough to ignite. Which it does pretty much all at once. Bang!
<br>
Helium fusion generates much more energy, so the star expands to a new
<br>
equilibrium. Now you have a helium fusing core surrounded by a hydrogen
<br>
fusing shell.
<br>
<p>Later on, you start to run out of helium, and build up a carbon core. So the
<br>
start have a shell of helium fusion and a shell of hydrogen fusion outside.
<br>
As the core gets larger, it collapses until it ignites with carbon fusion.
<br>
Bang!
<br>
<p>The process of getting from a helium core ignition to a carbon core ignition
<br>
is somewhat faster than getting a helium core ignition.
<br>
<p>Cute reaction pics: <a href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/textbook/energygen.html">http://zebu.uoregon.edu/textbook/energygen.html</a>
<br>
<p>After this, you can probably guess how it goes, with cores of increasingly
<br>
heavy elements igniting. The process speeds up and the ignition event
<br>
becomes more energetic for each new core element, ending in iron and a
<br>
supernova.
<br>
<p>This of course is a horrible simplification, ignoring the effects of mass.
<br>
Some stars will never be massive enough to ignite cores of a given
<br>
material -- it takes increasing heat and pressure to get elements to fuse as
<br>
they get heavier.
<br>
<p>This is a good life-cycle description with reference to what happens inside
<br>
a star at each point in time:

<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think everybody should read a bit of geophysics, astrophysics or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar sciences to get a whiff of just how marvellous our world is.
</em><br>
<p>Couldn't agree more, but then I'm biased. I think that if most people
<br>
understood just how complex and awe-inspiring the natural universe is,
<br>
there'd be less of this magical thinking and attempts to generate imaginary
<br>
complexity.
