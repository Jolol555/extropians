<em>&gt; &gt; So goes the litany of evils that so many Americans seem to project upon

the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You know what is the strangest thing? The people who foam most strongly

at
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the mouth when screeching about the evils of society are those who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefitted most from it. Those who have been born into the richer
</em><br>
classes,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who have gained their wealth and knowledge from countless generations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before them, demand that they alone be recognised as being the creators
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their good fortune and that they are damned if they will share it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anybody else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you prove otherwise? Government has always operated more as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hindrance to individuals attaining wealth than a help. How, in fact, did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government give Bill Gates $60 billion? How has it given Harvey, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brent, or any other successful extropian their wealth. Every one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will demonstrate how they worked their butts off for it.
</em><br>
<p>Does Bill really need $60 billion?  Sheesh, won't a paltry couple of billion
<br>
do anymore?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I don't deny that there are those who make a career of feeding at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public trough, and some of the smart ones even get rich at it, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the overwhelming majority do so just to avoid doing real work.
</em><br>
<p>Granted, again, this is from my own personal experience ... but it is the
<br>
overwhelming majority of rich people I've known who have avoided doing real
<br>
work and it is the middle class or poorer people I've observed who have done
<br>
the most work, often to ease the life for the &quot;poor&quot; rich blokes.
<br>
<p>O.
