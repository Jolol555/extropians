<p>&lt;&lt; This solution does not help space exploration or the viability of
<br>
&nbsp;multi-generational space missions.  This is merely an attempt to impose
<br>
&nbsp;traditional family units onto space travelers and to limit sexual
<br>
&nbsp;reproduction to married couples while shunning the use of artificial
<br>
&nbsp;insemination.  I see no reason why these traditional (and possibly
<br>
&nbsp;religious) limits should be imposed on the space program. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Because, if your sperm and ova bank, production of humans is deemed subject 
<br>
to inordinate flaws, if cryosleep is considered ultimately to be a failure, 
<br>
if uploading is demonstrated to be a dead-end, if relativistic flight is 
<br>
unachievable, if FTL ultimately becomes a pipe-dream...what else will work?  
<br>
You are banking on technological successes, while the evidence of the 20th 
<br>
century is replete with technological failures.
<br>
<p>*Disclaimer* I am NOT pronouncing any of these projects un-doable. I am 
<br>
playing Devil's Advocate in stating that they May Not be workable, for 
<br>
unknown reason, over the next several hundred years.
<br>
<p>Therefore, if you piss on the article's premise (feel free to do so) you also 
<br>
neglect to see it for the thought-experiement that it really is. The idea is 
<br>
focused almost exclusively, on no big advances in technology (highly 
<br>
unlikely), and it gives the Anthropologist some room to view this a a social 
<br>
experiment.
<br>
<p>If, for whatever reason, the human species, in the future, uses the gold old 
<br>
fashoned natalist venue, then that would indeed mean, that there are no 
<br>
alternatives, like relativistic interstellar flight. Perhaps 150 years after 
<br>
the launch of the good ship Procreation, the Ramship, Excelsior, bypasses the 
<br>
generation-ship by some 250,000 kilometers per second. By the time, the 
<br>
Procreation enters the Target solar system, the bots and their human 
<br>
companions, stage a welcoming celebration for the astonished new arrivals. 
<br>
Far fetched, but not so far fetched.
