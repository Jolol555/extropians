</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose each car could &quot;vote&quot; for the light (similarly for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pedestrians at crossings). At a crossing this would likely mean that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biggest queue would get green first, and decrease until the votes of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other queue weighed over. With a bit of inertia in the system this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely ensure a fair division. There is likely a bit of need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weighing votes by the time the light has been red too, in order to ensue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cars crossing a very busy street along a far less busy street ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will get past. At night, when there are few cars at all, all lights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would turn green since there are just single votes. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, traffic flow theory is filled with surprises and paradoxes, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if there are conditions where this kind of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>This turns out go be a non-trivial problem. Sure, each traffic light 
<br>
could attempt to maximize its &quot;profit&quot; locally, but if their agents are
<br>
intelligent, they will quickly realize that they can make a lot more 
<br>
money by cooperating with each other or with &quot;traffic arbitrage agents.&quot; 
<br>
A customer would contract with the traffic arbitrage agent
<br>
rather than attempting to contract with individual traffic lights.
<br>
The arbitrage agents would quickly realize that they can make higher
<br>
profits by negotiating among themselves to build packages of cars that
<br>
share routes, If the agents are all smart enough the result will 
<br>
approach a global optimization for the metropolitan area as a whole.
<br>
<p>Like any routing problem, this is only useful if the cost of the more
<br>
sophisticated routing algorithms are cheaper than the cost of additional
<br>
bandwidth (streets and highways in this case.) My area of expertise is 
<br>
routing in data networks. In data networks, even the crudest algorithms
<br>
work perfectly well when the traffic is at 50% of the available 
<br>
bandwidth, And even the best theoretical algorithm cannot achieve 95%
<br>
utilization with acceptable performance. In most data networks it
<br>
is cheaper to build extra capacity than it is to deploy better routing 
<br>
algorithms. The reason the Internet works at all is that its core is 
<br>
massively underutilized.
