----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; to prepare for the alternatives.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What this model completely fails to address is that our current actions
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; affect the fluffy bunny ETA.  We are not limited to waiting around
</em><br>
passively
<br>
<em>&gt; for the fluffy bunnies to arrive.
</em><br>
<p>Very good point. Possible actions one could take would include investing in
<br>
business corporations engaged in research; supporting authors whose work is
<br>
educational and persuasive, by purchasing and recommending their books;
<br>
donating to not-for-profit organizations engaged in research; and
<br>
contributing to educational and networking organizations such as Extropy
<br>
Institute.
<br>
<p>One of the books Max recommended, *The Richest Man in Babylon* by George S.
<br>
Clason, advises saving 10% of your income, giving 10% away, using 10% to
<br>
reduce your debt and spending the rest. This book was written at a time when
<br>
there was no social security tax and the income tax applied to only 5% of
<br>
the population.  Still, the general ideas are sound. Something interesting
<br>
I've noticed in helping clients manage cash flow (as well as managing my
<br>
own) is that writing down a budget and reviewing it often, preferably daily,
<br>
can have dramatically good effects on a person's life. I strongly recommend
<br>
doing a budget for time as well as for money. Far from being an irritating
<br>
constraint, a budget used in this way is an extremely useful tool for
<br>
acheiving one's goals.
<br>
<p>A good time management book is *How to Get Control of Your Time and Your
<br>
Life* by Alan Lakein.
