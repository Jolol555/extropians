<em>&gt; &gt;Yes, a mercantilist oligarchy is an apt description of a large

<em>&gt; &gt;chunck of the national government and big business, while the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;majority of business is still a free market (since most businesses

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;local/regional trade. Keep in mind that large scale labor brokers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(i.e. so-called labor unions) are also properly classified as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mercantilist oligarchs (since their members have little choice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;joining or not, and have no voice in how their membership dues are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;spent on bribing politicians), while other special interests, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;so-called NGO's, purport to have their members interests in mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but are generally just for anything that for-profit businesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are against, and vice versa, with a few exceptions, like the NRA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the Red Cross, etc..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A slight correction...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unions cannot spend member money directly on political causes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However unions due try to collect money ($3.00 a quarter) for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PAC, which is used for political purposes.
</em><br>
<p>Yet the union claims to represent ALL of its members when lobbying, AND
<br>
I have first hand experience with how 'voluntary' the PAC donation is.
<br>
Many unions, like Laborers International, actively discourage members
<br>
having a party affiliation outside the DNC, especially for shop stewards
<br>
and local presidents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can deduct the PAC from your dues and members like myself who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not blindly support a political party, do.
</em><br>
<p>And how many members of the union are aware of this and take advantage
<br>
of it? And how many unions do, in fact make this voluntary? A few? Some?
<br>
Apparently not a lot, since the unions have successfully fought against
<br>
this being mandated in the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Act.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The book I mentioned awhile back &quot;The Rule of Three&quot; goes into why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a mature market there will be three main generalist competitors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with niche players catering to speciality markets. An emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior of markets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Effectively an oligarchy.
</em><br>
<p>This is of course highly dependent upon what the cost of entry to the
<br>
market is as well as how advantageous economies of scale are in that
<br>
particular market. 
<br>
<p>A market that requires huge amounts of capital every year to be invested
<br>
in manufacturing infrastructure to compete effectively in the mass
<br>
market, as well as in new model year product development would tend
<br>
toward oligopoly under standard industrial technologies due to this
<br>
large cost barrier to entry. This is not always the case, however.
<br>
<p>For example, take the firearms industry. Few people will dispute that it
<br>
is a rather mature market: we are still using propellants and basic
<br>
architectures of firearms that have changed little in more than a
<br>
century, and many of the most popular models were designed, or are based
<br>
on designs dating back to the US Civil War. Yet despite this apparent
<br>
maturity, there are a dozen or more major firearms makers in the US
<br>
alone, and thousands of smaller outfits producing all manner of
<br>
firearms.
<br>
<p>Why is this? Ray Kurzweil can explain this best: because of
<br>
technological singularities. Industrial manufacturing technology has
<br>
become so mature, so commonplace, and so easy to use that the cost of
<br>
entry for a firearms maker is very small, and one can easily outsource
<br>
many manufacturing steps that a small maker cannot perform in house. A
<br>
good friend of mine is a firearms manufacturer who makes firearms in the
<br>
shop of his retail gun store and in his home workshop. Another group of
<br>
friends have a similar operation a few miles further down the road. 
<br>
<p>The only real restraint on their ability to do business is that of
<br>
governmental regulation, which restricts what kinds of arms they can
<br>
make and who they can sell them to.
<br>
<p>Look also at the illicit drug industry. In the manufacture of marijuana,
<br>
cocaine, heroine, methamphetamines and many other illegal drugs, it can
<br>
be said that the market is highly mature. The market for designer drugs
<br>
is small relative to the market as a whole, and the technology of
<br>
manufacture is inexpensive and easy to use.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, look at the software industry. There are far more than
<br>
three major software makers, and much, if not the majority, of software
<br>
comes from specialty programmers.
