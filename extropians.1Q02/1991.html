There are fruit trees lining the streets in some of the older suburbs in
<br>
Canberra, Australia. Plums, apricots (I think), other stone fruit? I can't
<br>
remember. Plums, mostly.
<br>
<p>When I was a student, I often lived in rental houses with an apple tree in
<br>
the yard somewhere (quite common) and fruit trees in the street. Thus, even
<br>
given my measly income at the time, I am alive now. I will always be
<br>
grateful for those fruit trees... they are a brilliant idea.

<p>(btw, I think it is the cost of cleaning/hazard of putrefying fruit which is
<br>
the reason they are banned in most places. It's a crazy business.)

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there is another problem, in Australia at least...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some time ago I looked into the idea of getting councils to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plant fruit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trees rather than decorative ones, and found out that it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some law or against some set of rules or guidelines. (I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly... it was about 20 years ago that I looked into this.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point is that there must be some reasoning behind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing this... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never found out what...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - maybe it is to lessen the cost of cleaning up putrefying fruit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - maybe it is because previous attempts to do this produced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local squabbles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - maybe people snuck around and stripped trees of fruit and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sold it at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - maybe moneyed interests in the local fruit trade were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just afraid of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their profits going down...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It sounds like an interesting question. If I wasn't so busy I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempted to look into it... unfortunately it will have to wait 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my uploading. :-)
