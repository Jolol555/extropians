<em>&gt; Overall, an enjoyable little website. There should really be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this for other questions (right now I'm reading a book about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal rights movement, and it has some interesting examples of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricky the issue of deciding what beings have rights and on what basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is; it would probably make a good &quot;battleground ethics&quot; setup). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How bizzarre... I am reading &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; by Peter Singer at the
<br>
moment. Same issues. Same book?
<br>
<p>I think that the ethical questions raised have are very strong in the
<br>
context of transhumanism, moreso than other philosophies, in that we support
<br>
morphological freedom, and thus must regard where we are now (human) as t(i)
<br>
(where i is some positive integer) in an iterative process. This implies far
<br>
less weight given to current qualities of humanity in determining who is
<br>
covered by concepts such as the Principle of Equality... any criteria based
<br>
on current human abilities must look entirely arbitrary. Thus with respect
<br>
to beings with below human levels of intelligence, which are otherwise
<br>
rather similar to us (eg: mammals), it is difficult to see where lines could
<br>
rightly be drawn to grant us rights but deny the same to them. After all, in
<br>
a context where we are talking about becoming SIs, etc, the difference
<br>
between a human and, say, a dog, is negligable.
<br>
<p>Thoughts?
