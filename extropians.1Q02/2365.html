At the risk of getting the PC pirates pissed at
<br>
me again (as happened on the list this thread

originally started on...)

<p>No envy here.  I just don't understand how some human beings (one not
<br>
essentially different from another) are worth billions and some are barely
<br>
valued at all (no matter how hard they work - and by &quot;work&quot; I mean doing
<br>
something that takes away from one's leisure and personal time).  That some
<br>
human beings are worth a BIT more than others I can understand.  But the
<br>
HUGE earnings gap by those at the top to those at the bottom - that I don't,
<br>
and looks like I never will - understand.  I've read the explanations
<br>
(written by the hunters, not the hunted), but they don't make sense to me.
<br>
Human beings are not that different one from another, and that's that.
<br>
<p>O.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Olga,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherish the gap. A few tens of thousands of years everyone was
<br>
destitute. Even the local shaman's main &quot;form of excessive wealth&quot;
<br>
was a job with plenty of slack time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These days things are different. That big huge gap is something
<br>
that makes me feel good about being a monkey.  I know that
<br>
the top drags the bottom, the gap gets wider, but where the
<br>
gaps boundaries are at the top AND the bottom are in everdynamic
<br>
motion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are very different from one another. There is infinite
<br>
variety amongst us, and there's plenty of room at the top.
<br>
Oh that's right..it's about socialization yielding all major differences
<br>
in outcomes and fuzzy words like dignity and equality backed up
<br>
with a court date.  Thanks but no thanks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stay out of MY yard.  (in a figurative way of course :)
<br>
<p>Blessed be the Gap, and all it's Work!
<br>
Brian
