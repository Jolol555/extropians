<em>&gt; &gt;Thus illustrating the primary divide between extropians and

<em>&gt; &gt;left-transhumans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Rights are not social fictions, they are codified expressions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You think the right believes in natural rights, and the left doesn't?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look at the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  The left believes deeply in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherent human rights.  Not entirely the same rights as the right (for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever value of 'right' might apply to extropians), but rights.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the left transhumans seem to be far more BORG oriented, and as
<br>
such put their fictional rights of society above the rights of
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conversely, the Culture and MacLeod's Solar Union don't believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherent rights; they're both materialist to a high degree, and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'left', although not obviously statist.  I admit I can't easily think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictional 'right' societies which don't believe in rights yet are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasant to live in.  (The Draka and the Chosen meet the first two, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't pleasant.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think much of Ian Banks' political intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, maybe that makes sense.  If you believe in selfishness as a good,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you need ingrained rights to balance that and have a decent society.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you believe in generosity and helping people as a good, the decent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society shows up automatically.
</em><br>
<p>Not so. Codifying compulsory generosity and cooperation makes for about
<br>
the worst society an individual could experience.
<br>
<p>When selfishness is a voluntary good, the golden rule becomes custom
<br>
rather than law out of self interest and not because the state has a gun
<br>
to your head. This is why a society like the US, which is among the most
<br>
selfish in the world, also contributes more to humanitarian causes than
<br>
any other, and not just as government expenditures. Private citizens and
<br>
groups in the US contributed something like $280 billion to charitable
<br>
works in 2000 alone.
<br>
<p>Because emphasis of selfishness makes individuals more productive,
<br>
individuals are better able to afford charitable giving to causes that
<br>
they choose themselves.
<br>
<p>This is a point which I tried to make at Extro5 but I'm not sure how
<br>
many actually understood it: virtuous behavior is only virtuous when it
<br>
is voluntary. Compulsory virtue is nothing but hell on earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have, though, known 'right' people who didn't believe in rights.  Like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said, I was one, and was influenced by one.
</em><br>
<p>I do recognise that there is a difference between the existence of
<br>
rights and their recognition by people. Objective truth always exists
<br>
irrespective of our ability to observe it and understand it. Whether
<br>
people draw up a social contract or not is really irrelevant to the
<br>
question of the existence of natural rights. Rights exist as a result of
<br>
nature, not because some people choose to grant them.
<br>
<p>If rights only exist as people recognise them, then fascism and other
<br>
forms of totalitarianism are as perfectly acceptable and morally
<br>
equivalent forms of government as democracy or republicanism. While
<br>
statists of this sort certainly exist on the right as much as the left,
<br>
I don't consider their opinion to be anything worth emulating.
