</em><br>
<em>&gt; food&quot; sign with food hanging on trees all around.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey that gives me an idea.  Most places could set up public farms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and trees.  Then when the will-work-for-fooders show up, they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a place to work if they really mean it: maintaining the public farms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They would be free to devour all they can eat.  We could even set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up army tents out there.  People would donate sleeping bags and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothing and such, especially if they saw will-work-for-fooders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually doing so.

<p>I worked in an orchard one spring in high school, and can say that it is
<br>
fine work for a healthy person to engage in, especially if the landowner
<br>
is a decent chap. We do hear in the news of heinous abuses of migrant
<br>
agricultural workers in the south and west, generally in areas where
<br>
abuse and oppression through the law have a long tradition, either as
<br>
represented in seizures of minority owned lands, in gun control laws, or
<br>
in laws governing treatment agricultural labor and tenant farmers.
<br>
<p>Up here in New Hampshire, 90% of the land was at one time cleared and
<br>
farmed. You can find stone walls dividing lots even in the deepest
<br>
wooded areas these days, where farmers had once cleared the land of
<br>
glacially deposited rocks to farm. In many of these areas, you can also
<br>
find old orchards of apples, pears, as well as blueberry and raspberry
<br>
patches, all gone wild. Mushrooms abound throughout the forest and can
<br>
fetch a high price at local markets, as well as other forest products
<br>
like ginseng roots, wild onions and cabbages, rhubarb and asparagus, and
<br>
nuts produced by many tree species, including beechnuts, chesnuts,
<br>
almonds, pine nuts, and more, which are all excellent sources of
<br>
protein. You can produce a natural flour from cat-tail reed heads, and
<br>
salad from fern fiddle-heads and immature dandilion leaves. And if it is
<br>
sugar you want, nothing beats the sugar bush (maple trees) for syrup,
<br>
sugar, and rock candy.
<br>
<p>Anyone can still live off the land in many areas of the US with a little
<br>
knowledge without the need for 'public farms' to strip the land of its
<br>
natural bounty for the sake of monocultured lots.
