<em>&gt; I'm no astrophysicist either,...but consider.  Earth

</em><br>
<p>A quick hint: which is retained most easily in a warm low gravity
<br>
environment like Earth and early asteroids, hydrogen or iron? Remember
<br>
that there has been several enriching processes going on for a long
<br>
time. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regarding a cooling/collapse problem resulting from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iron core, or a core with a substantial iron fraction:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is currently accepted that iron lies at the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum for nuclear binding energy based on nucleon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number. Thus, as Anders states, moving away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy minimum by transmuting iron into either heavier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or lighter elements would be an energy absorbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process.  However, as an alternative, might not this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process tend toward a steady reversibilty, with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equilibrium condition established where there was no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ongoing loss of energy to nucleosynthesis?  Wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it likely be the case that the energy would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systematically lost, but only stored temporarily in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements with a distribution of nucleon numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centered around iron, and a correlated distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; binding energies?  
</em><br>
<p>The binding energy curve has a quadratic minimum around iron, so energy
<br>
storage is unlikely. I haven't done the math (and I'm neither an
<br>
astrophysicist or skilled in statistical mechanics) but the chemical
<br>
equilibrium seems heavily iron-tilted. I think this is studied in most
<br>
textbooks in stellar astrophysics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wouldn't the current empirical evidence of a stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sun  suggest just such a condition of stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equilibrium, with equal numbers of nuclei transmuting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from and then back to iron?  I base this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposition on the (thermodynamic?) principle that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems tend toward their energy minimums.
</em><br>
<p>But the sun isn't an equilibrium system, it is very much an open system
<br>
- fuel is consumed and heat radiated away. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question of the putative iron core of the sun was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of fun to mull over.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I recently had to reformulate my mental picture of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar system.  List discussion of comets, and Amara's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;spotlight on dust in the solar system&quot;,  forced me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlarge the model--out to the furthest reaches of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oort cloud-- and throw a substantial quantity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;dirt&quot;--gas, dust, and cometary debris--into the once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tidy familiarity of brilliant star and orderly planets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and semi-disorderly asteriods). 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is a wonderfully complex environment. I want to see it
<br>
firsthand!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, it seems I have to do the same with the sun, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dump a couple of thousand earth masses of &quot;debris&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the mix.  Makes perfect sense to me that the sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should have a &quot;core&quot;.  Makes the sun an infinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complex system.  Gives it &quot;character&quot;.  Next time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find myself, of an evening, North of Half Moon Bay,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walking with my dog--worthless piece of fur; prime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; candidate for a vietnamese entree--along the bluffs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above the ocean, and I pause to watch the glowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spaceship end its daily sojourn and slip gracefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the mist-shrouded ends of the earth, I'll stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a moment, perk up, dance a little dance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; celebrate the magnificence of life, and think to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself, &quot;It's got a core.  A big honkin' system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexifying core.&quot;  And my dog will look up at me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and think,&quot;What the hell's gotten into him THIS time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I be happy.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. 
<br>
<p>I recently got myself a geology textbook, and it was a revelation. The
<br>
stories stones tell! How amazing a crack in a rock can be! The sheer
<br>
power of sand and waves!
<br>
<p>I think everybody should read a bit of geophysics, astrophysics or
<br>
similar sciences to get a whiff of just how marvellous our world is.
