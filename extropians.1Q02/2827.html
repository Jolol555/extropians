</em><br>
<p>Yet why is it that both alcohol and gambling are legal activities for
<br>
adults in most jurisdictions in the US, yet many perfectly normal adults
<br>
completely ruin their lives, and the lives of others (spouse/children
<br>
going homeless/malnourished, drunk driving homicides and injuries, etc)?
<br>
If the criminality of the substance were the only factor as you claim,
<br>
then alcholics and gambling addicts should have no negative impact on
<br>
society. The fact they do have one disproves the criminality theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I fully agree with Amara -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the state should not regulate drug intake by adults, except if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely unavoidable to limit access to drugs by adolescents, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are at the highest risk for becoming addicted.
</em><br>
<p>While I agree that the state should not regulate intake by adults (a
<br>
point which I have NEVER disputed, by the way), this does not mean that
<br>
addicts should not be held accountable for their actions just as
<br>
children and criminals are. Users should be required by their insurance
<br>
carriers (even in a libertarian setting) to adequately insure against
<br>
the externalities of their potential bad behavior while impaired and/or
<br>
addicted. If they do take care of this risk, then they can toke up with
<br>
my blessing.
