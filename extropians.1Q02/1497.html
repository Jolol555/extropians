<em>&gt;From: &quot;Alex Ramonsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alex@ramonsky.com?Subject=Re:%20a%20health%20dilemma.">alex@ramonsky.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My second question: some years ago I met a young woman in research
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who was bright, cheerful, fit and smoked about twenty a day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Encouraged by the efforts of others, she decided to quit. Within
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two weeks she was a depressed nervous wreck who couldn't handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialising at all. Once bright, she now seemed to find it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult to think, could not concentrate, and developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nervous habits.She remained like this, often suicidal and visiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;her doctor for medication. Then she started smoking again. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;symptoms disappeared, and she returned to her old 'normal' self.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Intrigued, we asked if she would be willing to have tests relating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to this. It turned out she was permanently deficient in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acetylcholine and various other neurotransmitters unless she
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smoked. What I am asking is: How many other people suffer from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this to a lesser degree, and, are they the ones who have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greatest difficulty giving up smoking?
</em><br>
<p>Many years ago a researcher (Candace Pert?) was studying why people
<br>
became addicted to heroin.
<br>
<p>She discovered that the brain had specific receptor sites for
<br>
opiates. Wondering why the brain had these sites led to the
<br>
discovery of the enkephlins and beta-endorphins, the brains natural
<br>
opiates.
<br>
<p>Addictive substances either function as an analog replacing a
<br>
natural substance or act as a stimulant for that sunstance. When
<br>
supplied from &quot;outside&quot; the brain either stops/reduces producing
<br>
the substance or requires the appropriate trigger substance.
<br>
<p>The delay in the brain reaquiring this ability is the well known
<br>
withdrawal effect.
