</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong again.  Learn about the ECB.
</em><br>
<p>a) Do different countries have the EXACT same bills and coins in every
<br>
detail? No, they don't. As several europeans here have said, there are
<br>
very slight but noticable differences on the paper bills and the reverse
<br>
side of every coin has  graphics particular to the country in which it
<br>
is stamped. 
<br>
b) Therefore, there are 12 different national mints involved in the
<br>
production of the new european currency, and the 12 different central
<br>
banks who run those mints.
<br>
<p>All it takes is for one of those mints to decide to over or under
<br>
produce their local currency to entirely mess up the money supply for
<br>
everyone.
<br>
<p>All that has really occured is that all 12 countries have changed the
<br>
name of their currency to the 'Euro' and have agreed to tie the value of
<br>
each to that of all other 'Euros', much as many countries in the world
<br>
tie their own currency one for one to the US Dollar. The heads of each
<br>
national Central Bank belong to the European Central Bank, but that
<br>
doesn't mean that each national bank will actually honestly deal with
<br>
everyone else.
<br>
<p>Up until a little bit ago, Argentina tied its Peso to the US Dollar in a
<br>
similar scheme, thinking that that was all they needed to guarantee
<br>
economic stability. They cheated on the backside though, and now have
<br>
destabilized markets all over South America. 
<br>
<p>Fortunately, it is easy for people to see the difference between an
<br>
Argentine Peso and a US Dollar, so there is little negative impact to
<br>
the US, but imagine if all the countries in the Americas had decided,
<br>
say, ten years ago, to change their local currency names from the &quot;Peso&quot;
<br>
to the &quot;Dollar&quot; and to tie their currencies one for one to the US
<br>
Dollar, while retaining control of their own mints, and of their own
<br>
national tax systems and securities (stocks and bonds) markets.
<br>
<p>Then imagine that a few years ago, say, Mexico's mint officials entered
<br>
into a scheme with their colleagues in the Presidency to overproduce
<br>
Mexican 'Dollars' without reporting the overproduction to the FTAA
<br>
Central Bank, using the money for political slush funds, for meeting
<br>
government revinue shortfalls, etc... When the scheme breaks in the
<br>
news, as all eventually do, worldwide trust in any 'Dollar' drops and
<br>
the economies of every nation in the Americas suffers.
<br>
<p>A prime real world example today of this is with OPEC. So far as the
<br>
world is concerned, the primary currency of any OPEC nation is the
<br>
Barrel of Crude Oil. Every OPEC nation supplies Barrels to the world
<br>
market supposedly according to specific quotas set by the agreements
<br>
that OPEC makes with its member nations, yet in actuality, many, if not
<br>
all, member nations cheat on their quotas, overproducing Barrels and
<br>
thus oversupplying the market, which leads to a glut and a decrease in
<br>
the value of a Barrel, which negatively impacts the economies of the
<br>
member nations.
