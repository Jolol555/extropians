<em>&gt; It's important also to bear in mind Robin Hanson's criticisms of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion that &quot;health care&quot; actually improves health in any way.  He pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to studies showing that providing unlimited health care benefits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals actually did not improve objective measures of health other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than some minor things like getting their teeth fixed.  They didn't live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer, they didn't get sick any less, they didn't have better quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life.  Robin also argued that the enhancements in health and longevity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the past century do not correlate clearly with the advances in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medicine which are often credited with the improvements.  Places with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the newest technology and rapid adoption of new health treatments do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not generally have healthier people than more backwards regions (this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is within the U.S. I think).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Do you have a url for this?
<br>
<em>&gt; I really miss Robin's absence from the list.
</em><br>
He's been regularly absent here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I know it is not polite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say so, but I would gladly give up JR's 50 posts a week for one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robin's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That is terribly rude of you. Although I suppose we should be glad that you
<br>
weren't so rude as to mention a few other names around here that should be
<br>
added to this list.
