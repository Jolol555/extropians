In v6#362 Robert Bradley wrote: &quot;The immigration system by its very nature
<br>
was designed to promote production -- ~200 years ago it was designed to
<br>
promote the production of furs.  ~100-150 years ago it was designed to
<br>
promote the production of metals and food. ~50-100 years ago it was designed
<br>
to promote industrial manufacturing.  It is my sense that the immigration
<br>
policy is now passed on because those of us whose ancestors at one point
<br>
were able to use it as a point of leverage feel it is only just that others
<br>
should be able to do so as well. In other words its a &quot;generous gift&quot; and
<br>
not a &quot;right&quot;.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Australia at present we are having some very heated debates regarding
<br>
immigration, particularly in regard to illegal immigrants &amp; refugees. Our
<br>
current governmental response (which I should state I am VERY much opposed
<br>
to) is one of punishment: all illegal immigrants/refugees (in govspeak they
<br>
are now called &quot;asylum seekers&quot;) are detained (i.e.: jailed in &quot;detention
<br>
centres&quot;), or, if their boat is detected before it lands they are jailed in
<br>
centres off the Australian mainland in &quot;friendly&quot; countries (eg Naru) that
<br>
have totally inadequate facilities at huge cost (so far we have spent so
<br>
much money on &quot;exporting&quot; our asylum seekers that they could all stay in a
<br>
$100 per night hotel for the next three years!).
<br>
<p>Obviously this solution is not working and is costing millions to implement.
<br>
To my mind this is at best a band-aid solution. The majority of immigrants &amp;
<br>
refugees (at least the one's we seem to be getting) have two main reasons to
<br>
immigrate or seek refugee status:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	They are fleeing countries where they have been persecuted
<br>
for political, religious or ethnic reasons.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	They are wish to immigrate for purely economical reasons
<br>
(i.e.. The standard of living is much higher than their homeland.
<br>
<p>The current punishment method that Australia is employing is simply not
<br>
working, is bloody expensive, and worst of all makes the nation look like a
<br>
pack of bastards. To my mind we need to take a more long-term solution, and
<br>
that is to remove the incentives for people to immigrate illegally. For
<br>
immigration reason 1 we need to take human rights issues, on a global scale,
<br>
more seriously. Those nations that continue to commit human rights abuses
<br>
should be punished for those abuses. I am not suggesting military action
<br>
(except perhaps as a last solution in extreme cases), punishment can take on
<br>
many forms including (&amp; not limited to) diplomatic actions &amp; economic
<br>
sanctions. 
<br>
<p>For those who are immigrating for economic reasons the only option I see
<br>
working over the long term is investing in those countries who are less
<br>
fortunate than us. If we can improve the standard of living, the employment
<br>
opportunities and the basic infrastructure in the immigrant's homeland, then
<br>
much of the impetus for immigration is removed. Surely by removing the
<br>
underlying drives behind illegal immigration by making the immigrant's
<br>
homelands a better place to live, we should at least be able to dramatically
<br>
slow the rate of immigration. Of course this proposition will be a difficult
<br>
sell to the tax paying corporations &amp; public of the 1st world despite the
<br>
long-term gains of additional markets for our own exports and a larger
<br>
percentage of the world population being more favourable towards the
<br>
assisting countries...
