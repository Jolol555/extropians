<p><em>    &gt;To make the point more clear: Interactive sentience confirms one's
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; own sentience, so that one doesn't need to &quot;guess&quot; that one is sentient.
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea what Interactive sentience could possibly mean and I
<br>
wouldn't be at all surprised if you didn't either. I can interact with your
<br>
body, your behavior and your intelligence but I can never interact
<br>
with your sentience.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt;I know for a fact that when I'm not conscious I'm not intelligent either
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt;Yes, but you only &quot;know&quot; that when you're awake. Obviously, when
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;you're not  awake, you can't know anything.
</em><br>
<p>Huh? Are you arguing that I'm intelligent when asleep?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Nothing needs to be thought of as &quot;conscious.&quot; It's a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;useless hypothesis
</em><br>
<p>Not useless at all, it helps us form a mental model of other human beings
<br>
and that helps us predict their behavior and that helps our genes get passed
<br>
on to the next generation. Every human being alive takes it as a given that
<br>
intelligent behavior equates with consciousness, including you, except when
<br>
you're arguing on the Extropian list that is; that's why you don't talk to people
<br>
about philosophy when they're asleep, you know you're unlikely to get a
<br>
very high-brow response.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;It was the insistence that intelligence somehow proves the existence
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;of the  useless hypothesis called &quot;consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>I most certainly never said &quot;prove&quot;! Perhaps I really am the only conscious
<br>
being in the universe but nobody, including you, could function in daily
<br>
life if they thought that, so even if it's false I must accept the axiom that if
<br>
something acts intelligently then it is conscious.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; You're stretching the argument to the point of ridiculousness, John.
</em><br>
<p>Of course it's ridiculous! You quite wisely think that something that
<br>
produced the ASCII sequence that I have must be conscious, proving
<br>
my point that when push comes to shove even you believe in my
<br>
axiom of existence, everybody does, no exceptions this side of a
<br>
loony bin.
