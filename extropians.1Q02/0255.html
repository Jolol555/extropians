Apparently you have nothing better to do, Mr Clark, than roast
<br>
me because I think it is bullshit to claim that WTC, horrific as
<br>
it was, was part of a worldwide plot to turn the US into a
<br>
Muslim theocracy.  I think it is bullshit and very dangerous as
<br>
I have tried to point out many times to escalate an already
<br>
tense situation with such memes.  I epxlained why I think so but
<br>
you can't be bothered with that.  You only want some grounds to
<br>
go on the attack and belittle apparently.  Well, I refuse to
<br>
play.

<em>&gt; It would have been better if you had. The entire point of the list rules is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlaw appeals to emotion rather than reason, at least that should be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point. Mr. Williams made a statement, you said you knew his motivation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the statement but you don't say how you figured out such a thing.
</em><br>
<p>I did not say any such thing really.  I said that this meme is
<br>
spread by those who want to escalate WTC to mean even more
<br>
horrific things that it does when seen as a despicable and
<br>
dangerous level of terrorism and vulnerability to terrorism.  As
<br>
this is in fact what this idea does for those who take it
<br>
seriously as has been seen on this very list I was not engaging
<br>
in any guesswork at all about Brian's motivations.  My statement
<br>
was not about his motivations.  I am sorry if you misread it to
<br>
be so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you get around to the content of his post all you say is it's &quot;bullshit&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't say why and I can find nothing incorrect in it.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I said quite a bit about why I thought this idea was
<br>
dangerous in this post and have said quite a bit in other posts
<br>
along the same lines.  I don't think there is any need to dredge
<br>
it all up again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If on the other hand you had called Mr. Williams a name at least rightly or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrongly there would have been a Implicit reason for your judgement, namely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thing that he wrote.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I called an idea a bullshit idea.  So what?  I believe it is
<br>
one.  I especially react that way when it is presented as if it
<br>
is a fact when it is not.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;But that was not what 9/11 was about and the thousands killed are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;irrelevant to whether that was what it was about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What on Earth does that mean? Please explain what &quot;that&quot; and &quot;it&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refer to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am saying that determining the value of the idea that I find
<br>
&quot;bullshit&quot;, e.g. that 9/11 is about turning the US into a Muslim
<br>
theocracy, is separate from and not clarified by bringing up
<br>
that thousands were killed.  That point, while certainly true
<br>
and horrific, has nothing to do with the validity or invalidity
<br>
of the idea I objected to.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Tossing them in bullies the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question my dear Ms. Atkins is how to prevent more thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;irrelevant&quot; Americans from being murdered by fanatical barbarians who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to change the world by force and move it in a direction that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very Extropian.
</em><br>
<p>I did not call any Americans &quot;irrelevant&quot; and you darn well know
<br>
it.  I do not believe that you will prevent terrorism by
<br>
claiming 9/11 is part of a plot to make us a theocratic state or
<br>
is primarily a result of such a plot.  I believe that escalates
<br>
the entire problem disasterously as I said in the initial posts
<br>
you are apparently too busy attacking to have digested fully.
