<p>The wonderful state of Texas had a similar case a while back.  A 
<br>
transsexual woman who had had surgery decades before and gotten 
<br>
married wished to contest her husband's wrongful death due to 
<br>
medical malpractice.  It was a pretty strong case and would have 
<br>
been open and shut against the hospital normally.  But defense 
<br>
found out her history and said the case was invalid because the 
<br>
marriage was invalid because she &quot;is a man&quot;.  This despite the 
<br>
fact that most states, Texas included, recognize the gender 
<br>
change and that the individual is of the target gender at least 
<br>
sufficiently to mark all paperwork so and to allow such 
<br>
marriages.  The court ruled for the defense.  It was a very dark 
<br>
day.  However, I know of serveral transsexual lesbian women who 
<br>
are talking of organizing to go get legally married in Texas to 
<br>
their non-transsexual partners.  After all, Texas can't expect 
<br>
to have it both ways. :)
