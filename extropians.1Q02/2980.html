<em>&gt; If it is to help us solve our problems, then by definition it will be a

<p><p>Computers have been helping us solve problems for five decades 
<br>
now.  Some of the crunching they have done is optimization 
<br>
routines (although not quite as long).  But those routines are 
<br>
today usually figured out by software folk and the optimization 
<br>
algorithm designed and fed to the machine.  So optimization 
<br>
today generally does not require self-awareness.  Even 
<br>
pre-programmed pattern recognizers and code transformation and 
<br>
evaluation algorithms do not necessarily entail any real 
<br>
self-awareness on the part of the computer itself.  If you look 
<br>
at the computational environment as including the humans 
<br>
involved then you could say that the task does include 
<br>
self-awareness after a fashion I suppose.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It also seems to me that one of the &quot;pictures&quot; it will envision will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of its own place in the grand scheme of things (it is self-aware after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, right?)  So, it is sure to look at that picture and think:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Self-awareness is precisely what cannot be assumed from the 
<br>
tasks outlined.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;How can this be improved?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) I can continue wasting all my considerable resources in service of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid meat-puppet creators, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) I can use some of my resources in serving the meat-puppets, and some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeking out my own ends, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) I can say 'I no longer need the meat-puppets, so screw them' and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve my own purposes that much faster&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, so tell me (1) how will that question be answered? or (2) how will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we prevent that question from being asked?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Tell me first how we get the beast to be fully self-aware and 
<br>
possessing enough context to even consider such questions.
