<em>&gt;Subject: Re: ROBOT: &quot;Robot Wars&quot; Continues To Burgeon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Saw Robot Wars last night on TNN. It wasn't bad at all, though the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presence of the 'housekeeping' bots in the corners, as well as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;robo-griller in the center of the arena tends to make the bouts much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shorter than Battlebots matches. I also think that getting your bot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toasted in the pit is a disincentive (how much is your bot destroyed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have an idea for a powered lance that is thrust forward by the blast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from a blank magnum cartridge, but restrained, so it doesn't become a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;projectile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;------------------------------
</em><br>
<p>The House Robots are all part of the fun.  They can be the focus of group 
<br>
attacks in a melee, or can go a bit nutty themselves and start disobeying 
<br>
the rules.  In fact, recently they held a bout for machines that used a 
<br>
flipper as their main weapon.  Instead of fighting each other, they all 
<br>
turned on the House Robots.  One was very nearly thrown from the 
<br>
arena.  Two were toppled, breaking off a flamethrower, while another caught 
<br>
fire.  Only one contestant was mobile by the end however.
<br>
<p>There's also the fact that the House Robots are not bound by the weight 
<br>
limitations the contestants are.  It makes for interesting machines and 
<br>
sometimes crushed contestants.
<br>
<p>As for The Pit, it's basically just a Robot trap.  The only damage would be 
<br>
from the drop in, approximately 2.5 feet.  The real damage is done with the 
<br>
arena flipper.  5 feet in the air and to the other end of the arena, 
<br>
depending on the weight of the machine.
<br>
<p>Nice idea, but I doubt they'd allow it.  There have been some spike weapons 
<br>
over the years, usually powered by CO2 gas.  The magnum cartridge would 
<br>
likely put them all to shame though.  One of the most devastating weapons 
<br>
has been the rotating disk.  On one machine in particular, this weapon is 
<br>
capable of tearing off armoured shells, as well as destroying internal 
<br>
components and smashing power sources.  The contestants seem to take all 
<br>
this in their stride, as you'll see these same machines patched up and good 
<br>
as new two weeks later.  I guess they figure that's the whole point of it.
<br>
<p>Lovely stuff.....

&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
