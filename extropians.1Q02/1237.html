</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an &quot;ism&quot; tends to put people off. It sounds too much like a cult, religion
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Implying or explicitly stating something that sounds like some kind of
<br>
organizational affiliation is a sure way to make people put up there memetic
<br>
defenses.  I never mention transhumanism or extropians when loosely
<br>
proselytizing to the mainstream; when people are ready for it, they will
<br>
likely find it themselves.  People are much more receptive if you are an
<br>
Ordinary Joe exactly like them who occasionally interjects interesting ideas
<br>
into the conversation, particularly when you aren't under suspicion of
<br>
selling something.
<br>
<p>A lot of people in the mainstream will come to the same conclusions as you
<br>
do if you give them enough to think about on their own.  It isn't so much
<br>
that the mainstream disagrees with transhuman and extropian philosophies as
<br>
it is that they've never really had to consider them.  A few subtle nudges
<br>
to a noncommittal brain can often be more effective than bible-thumping, and
<br>
the person will do most of the work for you.
