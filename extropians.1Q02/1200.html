<p>World’s Smallest Microchain Drive Fabricated At Sandia 
<br>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M — A microchain that closely resembles a bicycle chain — 
<br>
except that each link could rest comfortably atop a human hair — has been 
<br>
fabricated at the Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories. 
<br>
(The distance between chain link centers is 50 microns. The diameter of a 
<br>
human hair is approximately 70 microns.) 
<br>
<p>Because a single microchain could rotate many drive shafts, the device would 
<br>
make it unnecessary to place multiple tiny microelectromechanical (MEMS) 
<br>
motors in close proximity. Usually, a separate driver powers each MEMS 
<br>
device. 
<br>
<p>“All those drives take up a lot of real estate on chips,” says Sandia 
<br>
technician Ed Vernon, who has received a patent for the silicon microchain. 
<br>
<p>The microchain also makes it possible to drive a MEMS device from a motor 
<br>
situated at a distance, again saving considerable space on the MEMS-bearing 
<br>
chip. 
<br>
<p>The microchain, says Ed, could be used to power microcamera shutters, as 
<br>
larger chains currently do in the macroworld. It could also be used in 
<br>
mechanical timing and decoding. 
<br>
<p>The 50-link silicon microchain is designed to transmit power somewhat like 
<br>
the drive belt in a 19th-century sewing factory. There, a central engine 
<br>
shaft powered by steam turned drive belts to power distant work stations — 
<br>
for example, sewing machines — before the dawn of the age of electricity. 
<br>
<p>Chain systems, unlike stroke systems, do not require back-and-forth movements 
<br>
but instead allow for both continuous and intermittent drive translation. 
<br>
<p>Vernon fabricated a microchain rather than a microbelt because although 
<br>
silicon belts are tough and flexible, they are spring-like and produce too 
<br>
much torque on gears not aligned in a straight line. Each chain link, on the 
<br>
other hand, is capable of plus-or-minus 52 degrees rotation with respect to 
<br>
the preceding link, without creating pressure on the support structure. The 
<br>
wide angle means MEMS designers can be relatively unconstrained in 
<br>
positioning multiple devices. 
<br>
<p>The longest span unsupported by gears or bracing is 500 microns. A microchain 
<br>
tensioner is needed to accommodate longer spans. 
<br>
<p>The multilevel surface-micromachined silicon device was constructed with the 
<br>
aid of Sandia’s patented Summit IV and Summit V technology, which enables 
<br>
construction of complicated MEMS devices.
