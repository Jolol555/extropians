</em><br>
<p>If you look at anyone who is really wealthy, most of that wealth
<br>
was generated by capital appreciation and not from salary.  If you
<br>
look in detail at SEC reports, you will find that the &quot;income&quot;
<br>
that top executives get is heavily weighted as value from the
<br>
appreciation of stock options.  They get rich because they are
<br>
making other people richer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That some human beings are worth a BIT more than others I can
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'll give you a first hand story.  As many of you know during the
<br>
1980's Oracle and Sun were very high growth companies.  After they
<br>
went public the &quot;expectations&quot; were that they would double in size
<br>
and profits every year.  Well it doesn't take a Doug Jones to figure
<br>
out at some point that has to be an unrealistic assumption.  But
<br>
when the &quot;street&quot; expects you to do it corporate executives are
<br>
on the hook to perform.  Around 1991 Oracle &quot;hit-the-wall&quot;.  But
<br>
because the pressure was on the VP of sales, some corners were cut,
<br>
some sales were booked before they actually took place, etc.  When
<br>
the dust settled the earnings had to be restated and a near Enron-style
<br>
meltdown of the stock valuation took place.
<br>
<p>If you go look at the chart, it appears as a minor &quot;bump&quot; in the
<br>
overall history of the company.  But at the time it wasn't at all!
<br>
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ORCL&amp;d=c&amp;k=c1&amp;a=v&amp;p=s&amp;t=my&amp;l=on&amp;z=m&amp;q=l">http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ORCL&amp;d=c&amp;k=c1&amp;a=v&amp;p=s&amp;t=my&amp;l=on&amp;z=m&amp;q=l</a><br>
<p>The repercussions were not insignificant.  There were a number
<br>
of shareholder lawsuits.  The company did make payouts to the
<br>
shareholders.  People were calling Larry and telling him he had
<br>
just cost them their entire retirement accounts, etc.
<br>
<p>The reason executives receive high compensation is because they
<br>
are playing high stakes games.  And at times the pressure gets
<br>
to be too much as the recent ex-Enron executive suicide shows.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've read the explanations (written by the hunters, not the hunted),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but they don't make sense to me.  Human beings are not that different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one from another, and that's that.
</em><br>
<p>But human beings *are* different in the positions they hold, how
<br>
much &quot;wealth&quot; they are responsible for, how creative they can
<br>
be (for better or worse), etc.
<br>
<p>Individuals who receive extraordinary compensation or who have
<br>
extraordinary net worth are those who have demonstrated they
<br>
can see the opportunities, steer the ship and return value to
<br>
the people who bet on them.
