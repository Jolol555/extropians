<p><em>&gt;You know, I hadn't intended to ask, but I just don't get it.  Why are there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traces at all of Friendly AI concepts in this discussion?  I don't just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the answers, I mean the underlying systemic concepts used to untangle the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions.  Nobody is distinguishing between supergoals and subgoals.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is distinguishing between the goal system, the goal system's external
</em><br>
<em>&gt;referents, and the AI's reflective design model of its own goal system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People are asking the same questions they were asking in 1999.  I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand if there'd been progress and yet not progress toward Friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but this is just stasis.  Why?
</em><br>
<p>Well, as the guy who started this thread, I suppose it falls to me to answer 
<br>
that one.  My answer is that, so far as I comprehend it, your 
<br>
supergoal/subgoal explanation does not resolve the problem.  My 
<br>
understanding of your theory is that, so long as the AI's sub-goals are all 
<br>
in service of friendly supergoals, we have nothing to fear.  But, I'm making 
<br>
a few assumptions, and here they are:
<br>
<p>1. The AI will be curious (either as a sub- or supergoal);
<br>
<p>2. The AI will have &quot;general intelligence&quot; (such that it can evaluate a huge 
<br>
decision tree and choose which among the myriad branches will best meet its 
<br>
goals);
<br>
<p>3. It will be self-aware (such that it has an accurate picture of the world, 
<br>
including its own place in that picture).
<br>
<p>If any of those assumptions is wrong, then you can forget everything I've 
<br>
said before.  But, if each of those assumptions is correct, then they 
<br>
inherently conflict with your concept of a friendly AI.  If you do not see 
<br>
this conflict let me know and I'll paint the picture in full detail (if 
<br>
you're still interested by now.)
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
