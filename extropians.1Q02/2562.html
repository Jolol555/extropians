</em><br>
<p>It's probably his own behavior that chesh is modifying, not the
<br>
lights'.  Back in my wild days as a late-night taxi driver, I learned
<br>
which lights in Colorado Springs were triggered by sensors in the street
<br>
(some of which required *two* counts to trigger a change- zoom up, slam
<br>
on the brakes, throw it in reverse, back up, pull forward, light changes
<br>
pronto), which were synchronized for a particular speed (drive mellow,
<br>
stay back from the leading edge of the traffic wave, get there quick and
<br>
safe), and which were on dumb timers (watch the light from a distance,
<br>
adjust speed according to the current light state and distance).
<br>
<p>I also learned that the 45 mph synchronized lights on a major N-S
<br>
arterial could also be negotiated at speeds from 60-90 mph, since the
<br>
spacing between them varied.  On a long stretch without lights, I'd
<br>
accelerate and hit the next green light only seconds after it came on,
<br>
then squeeze thru the end of the next light having gained almost one
<br>
half cycle; at the third one, another half cycle ahead, I'd be early
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>The safest way to speed on the city streets, though, was to follow a
<br>
lights-out cop about 200 feet back- hard for him to give you a ticket
<br>
for matching *his* non-emergency speed.
<br>
<p>Thus one occupies one's mind when underemployed.
