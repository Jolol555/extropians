<p>Actually, in most AMD CPUs you have the naked die underside looking at
<br>
you. A number of people had to find out how brittle silicon is the hard
<br>
way (chipped edges at best, dead die at worst).

<p><em>&gt; Seriously, though, Intel chips don't have built-in fuses, they rely on

</em><br>
<p>No idea. I'm told recent AMDs have built-in thermal protection, but no
<br>
motherboard so far (?) supports that. Given that their power density is
<br>
currently higher than Intel, this means instant thermal death if your heat
<br>
sink grows a gap, or a slow death if your fan fails or the fan connector
<br>
gets unplugged.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; credibility? This is pretty obvious FUD from Intel.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, that's empirical observation from the trenches. Thermal design for
<br>
AMDs is far more critical than Intel. For time being, I'm rather fond of
<br>
AMDs, and this won't deter me from building my viz/number crunch box on
<br>
AMD. Meanwhile, my current box is a 700 MHz Intel Celeron (Coppermine)
<br>
stepping 06 (hey, I got it virtually for free), and my server/network
<br>
appliance will be based on an 1.3 GHz Tualatin Celery. Part of my choice
<br>
was a form factor, part of it was uncritical thermal and acoustical
<br>
design.
