<p><em>&gt; What do we export? How would the being a citizen of this virtual nation work? Would it be my house/apartment seceding from the US (or wherever)? How would that work if I was renting my home, or living with my parents (as I do)?
</em><br>
<p>There's room for a lot of innovations here. One might have an alternate
<br>
U.S. where Gore is president, for example. The system may be more
<br>
important than the specific setting. You might be a citizen in hundreds
<br>
of virtual worlds. Perhaps one would be a world where you're luxuriating
<br>
in a resource-rich environment whilst simultaneously trying to avoid
<br>
alien bloodsucking predators, which might be like living at home with
<br>
your parents ;-)
<br>
<p>As for exports, how about AI's? Imagine an FPS where the computer
<br>
opponents learn continuously during the course of the game. When you
<br>
start the game initially, the bad guy just stands there and shoots at
<br>
you, without any tactics or evasions. With some basic concepts
<br>
programmed in (e.g. walls are opaque and bulletproof). But if the
<br>
program could learn over time how to be a challenging opponent, the
<br>
resulting code might be marketable to game companies.
<br>
<p>How about a game where you're a room mate in a group house, and the
<br>
object is to clean the house. As folks compete to clean various
<br>
combinations of houses and messes, you build up huge databases, which
<br>
might then be marketable as customized choreographed housecleaning
<br>
routines, so housemates get a detailed plan to follow that minimizes
<br>
their housecleaning time. Seems to me the concept of evolved
<br>
choreography could be used in many projects involving physical movement.
<br>
<p>In any case one can always spend years practicing Quake and then compete
<br>
in tournaments...
<br>
<p>Since I work from home, making websites, and also spend a great deal of
<br>
time just reading sites and seeking out ones that are innovative or
<br>
aesthetically pleasing, I pretty much live in a virtual world right now.
<br>
Since I used to commute (often lengthy distances), and do my reading
<br>
from books and magazines, my current situation allows for a considerably
<br>
lighter workweek (I consider it good if I do 25 billable hours in a
<br>
week) and lets me save money and enjoy a 'virtually' better lifestyle
<br>
than I had previously. (Of course, I consider reading about web issues
<br>
leisure time activity, and if one considers this 'work', then by that
<br>
definition I work 50+ hours a week.)
