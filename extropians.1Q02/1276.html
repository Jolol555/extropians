First of all, a definition.
<br>
<p>Central meme of transhumanism (CMT):
<br>
It is right to use technology to improve on Homo Sapiens.
<br>
<p>Anders said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, I think the idea of technology being the central meme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is horribly wrong, and if we present ourselves based on *that*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we will lose much.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I must be philosophically challenged, because, in my view, if you take 
<br>
away *that*, all is left of transhumanism is just some version of humanism. 
<br>
That is exactly what the mainstream is likely to see and it will then behave 
<br>
accordingly, i.e. it will adopt CMT and it will treat transhumanism in 
<br>
exactly the same way as it treats humanism today… it will largely ignore it 
<br>
(by the way, I think this also applies to libertarianism or any other 
<br>
ideology).
<br>
<p>and:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the concept &quot;the central meme of transhumanism&quot; ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be staked through the heart and buried behind an event horizon -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is too dangerous and seductive through its apparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simplicity, catchiness and ecumenism. :-)
</em><br>
<p>Of course you do!
<br>
<p>It WILL be a powerfully seductive idea to some (once the tech is here) and 
<br>
it will be a powerfully repulsive idea to others. It will split the 
<br>
political arena in pro and against (we are already witnessing the initial 
<br>
stages of the process with the cloning and biotech crops debate). Our main  
<br>
job should be to make sure the pro-CMT side wins. If anybody wants to 
<br>
promote a humanist view at the same time, fine by me (or any other view 
<br>
compatible with “western style democracy” for that matter), but that takes 
<br>
second place of importance, in this context.
<br>
<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but when the CMT hits mainstream, the 
<br>
ideologies that support it might get a boost, but they are unlikely to go 
<br>
mainstream in the same way… the CMT is bound to outgrow and leave behind 
<br>
both transhumanism and extropy… The problem is (if it is a problem) that the 
<br>
CMT can not be fully claimed by any of the many ideologies that have or will 
<br>
adopt it *to the exclusion of the others*. We are it’s parents and it is 
<br>
approaching it teen-age years… we’d better learn to let it go, increasingly 
<br>
out of our direct control…
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The central meme of socialism isn't government control, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;central meme of libertarianism isn't free markets. They are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means to ends (equality and liberty, among others).
</em><br>
<p>It just needs a bit of rephrasing, then: equality is the central meme of 
<br>
socialism and liberty is the central meme of libertarianism.
<br>
<p>Which reminds me of another thing I wanted to mention...
<br>
<p>To put it rather brutally:
<br>
<p>transhumanism = CMT + humanism
<br>
extropy = CMT + libertarianism
<br>
<p>Other ideological sides will do what libertarianism and humanism were the 
<br>
first to do… I wonder what the results will be… (some of the following will 
<br>
not be pro-CMT, of course…)
<br>
<p>CMT + (US) Democrats = ?
<br>
CMT + (US) Republicans = ?
<br>
CMT + (European) Christian Democrats = ?
<br>
CMT + (European) Social Democrats = ?
<br>
CMT + Catholicism = ?
<br>
CMT + Hinduism = ?
<br>
Etc…
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
