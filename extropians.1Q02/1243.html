<p>Human individuals and societies tend to change because

individuals die and are replaced, or we adopt some idea that is initially

attractive and then find out that it doesn't work, or we learn something
<br>
new and surprising about the nature of reality. SIs presumably will not
<br>
have these problems. It seems plausible that they will quickly settle into
<br>
a stable state with long term goals that don't change over time.
<br>
<p>In other words, I think rational design and goal-oriented action will play
<br>
a much bigger role than survival-of-the-fittest kind of evolution in
<br>
governing how SIs change over time.

<p><em>&gt; I don't know how you would go about preserving trust relationships

<p>Human beings are able to preserve trust relationships over periods
<br>
comparable to their life times. Why shouldn't SIs be able to do the same
<br>
thing? What problem will prevent them from doing this over millions of
<br>
years?

<p><em>&gt; Sure, but you have to have sufficient metals to burn it in a fusion

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You can fuse hydrogen into metals and build your reactors in an
<br>
exponential bootstrapping process. It doesn't seem to be an insurmountable
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>BTW, do you consider full matter-to-energy conversion via small black
<br>
holes to be &quot;magical physics&quot;? If not that would allow you to disassemble
<br>
a star even more quickly.
