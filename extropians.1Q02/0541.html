<em>&gt; It seems that most people on this list believe that Singulartity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in time to save them. That medical advances will assuredlly keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them in fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fettle, so that when the technology is there, they will merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload, ala Permutation City &amp; Diaspora.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if this doesn't occur in time? What if both the hardware and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software to accomplish this sea-change in life on old planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth, doth take its own sweet time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will most of the Extropians hedge their bets and have themselves Alcor-ed?
</em><br>
<p>More or less my own feelings on timing; be great if it happens, but it's not
<br>
something you can gamble on. But asking people to believe it might not
<br>
happen in time is asking people to work and think about death. Very
<br>
unpopular, those topics.
<br>
<p>More activism needed. More funding needed. More people buying into the
<br>
various useful memes needed.
<br>
<p>The Singularity tomorrow thing is so much like a religion in far too many
<br>
ways. Quite likely suicide too, if enough people adhere to it. In a way it's
<br>
going to be real annoying to have them tell you &quot;I told you so&quot; after
<br>
(insert number here) years of hard work by the rest of us have brought the
<br>
Singularity about while the lazy ones lazed around just *believing*.
