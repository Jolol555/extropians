</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have yet to see someone explain to me how the human need to breathe, 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Since those things are not what distinquishes humans from other 
<br>
animals they are clearly not a sufficient place to look for a 
<br>
nature based justification of what humans rights.  Reducing the 
<br>
argument to such inanities is worse than hand-waving.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;Codified physical law&quot; is hand-waving.  There is the physical universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which includes biology and evolution.  There are human concepts of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same.  The map is not the territory.  A human concept is not a physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law (in fact, &quot;physical law&quot; is a merely a human concept - and there are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists who are not so sure that there ARE &quot;physical laws&quot; operative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the Universe).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Are you claiming that human beings hae no specific nature and 
<br>
that their nature does not lead to certain conditions being more 
<br>
optimal for their well being, particularly concerning their 
<br>
interaction with other people and instutions of same?  You have 
<br>
to claim this if you are going to utterly dismiss the argument.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical laws are not the end and be all of what is real and 
<br>
important.  They are the basis of reality but do not utterly 
<br>
contain everything in reality, if you see what I mean.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Give the above notion of natural rights the natural rights exist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; regardless of whether they are honored by any particular ruler or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mob.  Judging the actions of the rulers or mobs is done relative to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; supporting or denying these &quot;natural rights&quot;, these requirements for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; human well-being.  This seems much more reasonable than attempting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reverse, judging the concept of natural rights on the basis of whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this or that leader or group would honor and uphold them.   Saying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they are a social contract, in my opinion, makes a similar mistake.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It puts the emphasis on upholding these rights rather than on whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; certain &quot;rights&quot; naturally are required by dint of the nature of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This still begs the question:  why is the concept &quot;rights&quot; needed?  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have basic human physical needs.  Why elevate them to &quot;rights&quot; unless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are trying to score points in a moral debate?  A principle of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectivist epistemology, I recall, is that concepts should not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiplied beyond need.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I already answered that question.  And the second one by 
<br>
implication. It is a principle of Objectivism that rights are 
<br>
objective, derivable from reality.  If so there is no 
<br>
multiplication of concepts beyond need.  What exactly would you 
<br>
base ethics on if not on some understanding of what is required 
<br>
for human beings to function optiomally together?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What your nature requires relative to the actions of others or their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; refraining from certain actions for your optimal functioning does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; change based on how they do in fact act toward you.  Natural rights 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; therefore are not a matter of social contract.  Social contracts, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they are rational, grow out of these &quot;natural rights&quot; - not the reverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human behavior as individuals and groups is based on human &quot;nature&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e., the structure of our bodies and brains and our physical and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural evolution - and to an enormous degree on our primate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary heritage.  This behavior considered as a whole can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modeled by various sciences and by economic theory a la Von Mises 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; praexology [or is that praxeology - I can never remember the spelling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :-} ]  Such an economic analysis leads to the conclusion that coercion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a large scale or as a general principle of behavior is not productive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a group of sentient conceptually processing entities as a whole.  No 
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a way of arriving at much the same thing.  You seem to 
<br>
be quibbling more over semantics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;natural rights&quot; are needed - it is simply not productive and therefore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not conducive to survival and therefore not in the best interests of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such entities to engage in coercion as a behavioral principle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Your first assertions does not justify your derived conclusions 
<br>
as you have not grounded it in anything but opinion thus far.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The reality, however, is that humans as part of their basic nature as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological entities fear death.  This translates into the same basic two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactions as any other animal:  fight or flight.  In humans, with 
</em><br>
<p><p>What do humans have that other animals do not have?  It is there 
<br>
that we must explore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; imagination and conceptual processing capability, this is expressed in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two ways for each reaction.  Fight:  1)  self-development or controlling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's personal being (examples might be bodybuilders, martial artists, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever). 2) Concern with understanding and controlling external 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality (examples might be scientists, technologists, etc.)  Flight 
</em><br>
<p><p>What is required to freely act on the basis of one's thinking 
<br>
and conclusions?  Without that freedom, can humans make most 
<br>
effective use of their superior abilities to think and model 
<br>
reality?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Response: 1) Stand up and wave your arms and try to attract the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention of the &quot;gods&quot; who might give you more life if you stand out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the herd (examples:  anyone in the public eye and anyone who tries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to establish themselves as morally superior to everyone else, e.g., 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priests and philosophers and moralists of every stripe); 2) Tear down 
</em><br>
<p><p>This is simple libel.  Not all people of these groups do 
<br>
anything of the kind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; everyone above you and stamp on everyone below you (examples:  virtually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone, especially politicians).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>My, you are cynical, aren't you?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Instead of recognizing the universe has plenty of resources and the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survive is to use our conceptually processing capability to take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of those resources, i.e., fight response, - defy and defeat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death by using our mental and physical resources - the vast bulk of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human race (at least 98-99%) engage in flight response, producing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darwinian competition &quot;war of all against all&quot; which leads to the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you see around you.
</em><br>
<p><p>You almost had it but you keep getting mired in too simple 
<br>
stimulus/response levels.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See Alan Harrington's work &quot;The Immortalist&quot; - probably the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important book ever written on the impact of death on human society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without relieving the species' fear of death, there is no way you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to override that fear and its flight response with talk of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rights&quot;, when those &quot;rights&quot; are merely concepts that will be accepted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or rejected based on the individual's fear reactions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Irrelevant. It is only by exercising our ability to think and to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;understand our universe and act on that understanding to a 
<br>
high degree that we can ever hope to long postpone or even 
<br>
largely defeat death.  Therefore that which increases our 
<br>
abilities in these areas, our freedoms to pursue them and our 
<br>
freedom to act on our conclusions, is the most essential 
<br>
solution to the general problem as you set it up.  Those things 
<br>
required for such an increase are thus logical requirements of 
<br>
any system governing the interaction of human beings (ethics). 
<br>
One concept/phrase wrapping such requirements and delineating 
<br>
them is &quot;natural rights&quot;.  We may argue about what is and is not 
<br>
such a requirement but I don't see how anyone can logically 
<br>
fault the general basis in our own nature for their being such 
<br>
requirements.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The only rational argument for non-coercion is based on economic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest which in turn is based on the economic interest of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species as a whole.  This argument, however, cannot override genetically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inbred fear, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>More assertion?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The issue of &quot;rights&quot; is IRRELEVANT to the issue of personal survival 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is the only valid human purpose.  Personal survival demands 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.  One can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly proceed on the basic of a principle of non-coercion, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to convince any significant portion of the species of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validity of this is a waste of time and therefore counterproductive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>More assertion.  Personal survival is not the only valid human 
<br>
purpose.  The world as it is includes what is required by human 
<br>
nature for our own best functioning and the best function of our 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;organizations, society and species as a whole.  It is not 
<br>
counterproductive to point out where our best interests lie in 
<br>
anything more than the extreme short-term.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Mike's notion that because human nature derives from evolution and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical universe that this translates a concept into a &quot;natural law&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an irrational and mystical concept.  See Robert Anton Wilson''s &quot;The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Myth of Natural Rights&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>That is not what he or I said and such an empty attempt at 
<br>
parody is not a valid attempt at discussion.
