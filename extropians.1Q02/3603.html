<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point, however, was limited to showing you don't need writing to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking -- whether that is philosophizing or whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There also seems to be some evidence that preliterate people are better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at recalling lot of details.  (If this is true, my guess would be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most literate people forget stuff merely because they can easily rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing for recollection.  So, they never develop a habit of non-written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory -- or not to the same extent&gt; books...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not to attack writing.  I think it's one of the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inventions of all time.  I just don't reduce everything else to it.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think humans did and still do a lot thinking and remembering outside of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Two things. It's certainly true that the art of memory can be very highly
<br>
developed in societies that are largely non-literate or where books/printed
<br>
texts are very costly Frances Yates wrote a wonderful book on this, &quot;The Art
<br>
of Memory&quot;. But, granted some people will be able to do philosophy (and
<br>
geometry and other forms of analytical reasoning) without writing, there are
<br>
still two points to consider. It will be much more difficult to store and
<br>
transmit the results, so knowledge will tend not to be cumulative, to grow
<br>
over time. Also isn't it the case that the widespread use of the written
<br>
word (which is likely to be much more widespread than highly trained memory)
<br>
encourages a particular kind of lineal, analytical thinking in the
<br>
population at large? Steve Davies
