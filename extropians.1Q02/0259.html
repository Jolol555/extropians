<em>&gt; &gt; ... As I have asked many times here and

<em>&gt; &gt; technology, for anyone with less than a certain amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; general intelligence and a fair amount of training?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The most likely effect of continued automation is to move
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Isn't it a bit over-optimistic to believe that, say, everyone
<br>
below an IQ (assume for the moment that is meaningful please) of
<br>
120 will have the skills and personality to work as an
<br>
entertainer or find a personal service job when the level of
<br>
techology becomes great enough that there aren't a lot of other
<br>
jobs for them?  I think we are headed to a world perhaps not
<br>
that extreme but extreme enough that there is no reasonable
<br>
prospect of their being a job for all adult citizens that is not
<br>
make-work.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as the automation of agriculture totally changed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American labor market from one where the majority of workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were agricultural to one where only a small minority now are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continued automation of manufacturing will change the face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of labor from manufacturing to services.  Whatever humans
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that only a supposition and isn't an analogy with a very
<br>
different time fundamentally dangerous and likely to lead us
<br>
into erroneous conclusions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; can do usefully--make judgments, entertain other humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research and create--the market will expand demand for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, because the decreasing cost of manufactured goods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the same time it puts builders out of work, will also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase the income available to the purchasers of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufactured goods to buy other things, like services and
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  How will it increase income except for those few who have
<br>
highly in-demand skills?  Are you sure there are enough of them
<br>
with enough income and desires fulfillable by the others? 
<br>
Offhand I see no reason to believe a priori that this will be
<br>
the case.  Suppose it is not the case for just a second for the
<br>
sake of argument.  What would you propose then?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; artworks.  Human judgment will become valuable: for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the simple act of filtering and evaluating imformation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become a valuable service.  More people will have personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caterers and gardeners and secretaries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why would I hire a secretary when my futuristic ubiquitous
<br>
computing environment does a much better job?  Why a caterer or
<br>
gardener if the garden really is largely automated and takes
<br>
care of itself and planing menus and having everything arrive
<br>
perfectly on time is largely automatable as well?  While I am
<br>
sure that some of what you propose is true I find it unlikely
<br>
that it is true enough not to leave many people without jobs as
<br>
we now think of them that just naturally grew out of market
<br>
demand.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's really quite simple: whenever a job is eliminated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because a machine can do it better, all of the people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formerly paid for what that worker produced will now pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less for what the machine produces, and will therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have more income to spend on other things.  And they /will/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find ways to spend it, and it /will/ end up employing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the same amount of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But what will they choose to spend it on?  Again, there is a bit
<br>
of supposition here that claims there is no problem.  But there
<br>
is no proof and it leaves the question still of what you would
<br>
want to happen if your suppositions prove incorrect.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't even have to be as direct as that: when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who no longer buys the expensive hand-made good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buys the cheaper machine-made good and just stashes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra money in a bank account, the bank is enabled to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lend more for new business ventures to hire more people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This still assumes old line economics and that the bank will see
<br>
ventures as profitable that all of these people will think of
<br>
and have the skills to execute.  There is insufficient
<br>
validation of this premise.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ... It is also not clear to me that having a &quot;job&quot; is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; best and only reasonable way that citizens may be productive or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they have access to a reasonable level of comfort and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; freedom to pursue their happiness.  The &quot;job&quot; paradigm may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increasingly obsolete as may be some old economic models based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in more scarcity and less high technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly the things people do as their &quot;job&quot; will change over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and may become things we wouldn't recognize as &quot;jobs&quot; today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the basic facts can't change much: human beings are not born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-sufficient.  We have to acquire food, water, etc., from our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment in order to sustain life.  As long as that is the case,
</em><br>
<p>A bit down the road food, shelter, clothing, information will
<br>
pretty literally &quot;grow on trees&quot;.  What then?  Do we head in the
<br>
direction of some tropical paradise societies? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; we'll have to have a system to create those things and allocate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  Currently, the best system we have is for some subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people who are best suited to the task actually create those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, and some of us offer our services to those people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange for the things, and the rest of us offer whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; services we can perform to whoever wants them to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribute those things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But that system is best in a context and that context is likely
<br>
to change very drastically.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; When we make ourselves into self-sustaining solar-powered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robots, then that might change.  But in the meantime, we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a damned good system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it is that damned good even now.  There is much
<br>
too much waste of resources, time, intelligence and people
<br>
today.  I don't see why it will get a lot better through
<br>
technology alone if we also aren't open to changing our models
<br>
to match new circumstances.
<br>
<p>Thanks for tackling this one.
