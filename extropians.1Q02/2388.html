<br>
me, I added only the one about the extropians.  {8-]  spike

<p>Subject:      Fw: Fwd: Fw: Corporate cows
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;AN AMERICAN CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. You sell one, and force the other to produce the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;milk of four cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A FRENCH CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. You go on strike because you want three cows.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A JAPANESE CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. You then create
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;clever cow cartoon images called cowkimon and market them
<br>
&nbsp;World-Wide.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A GERMAN CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. You reengineer them so they live for 100 years,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;eat once a month, and milk themselves.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;An EXTROPIAN CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows.  You read their DNA and figure out a way to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;create lean beef directly in a vat.  You upload your cows.  You debate
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;endlessly on what to do with the originals cows, which are still alive
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;and well, and are demanding bovine rights.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A BRITISH CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. Both are mad.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;AN ITALIAN CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows, but you don't know where they are. You break for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lunch.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A RUSSIAN CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. You count them and learn you have five cows. You
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again
<br>
&nbsp;and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open another
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bottle of vodka.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A SWISS CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have 5000 cows, none of which belong to you. You charge others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for storing them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;AN INDIAN CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. You worship them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A CHINESE CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. You have 300 people milking them. You claim full
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;employment, high bovine productivity, and arrest the newsman who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reported the numbers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;AN ISRAELI CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are these two Jewish cows, right? They open a milk
<br>
&nbsp;factory, an ice cream store, and then sell the movie rights. They send
<br>
their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;calves to Harvard to become doctors. So, who needs people?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;AN ARKANSAS CORPORATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two cows. That one on the left is kinda cute...
