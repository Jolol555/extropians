</em><br>
<p>True. When you find a skeleton in your wardrobe, it is usually you who
<br>
put it there yourself. 
<br>
<p>As for my witchcraftish stuff, it is these days mostly linked to my
<br>
roleplaying interests. Still something that tends to make people
<br>
suspicious (with the exception of dotcom people here in Stockholm, many
<br>
of which are quite familiar with roleplaying games - Jonas Birgerson,
<br>
the posterboy for Swedish dotcom hysteria and dotcom death, was the
<br>
chairman for the Swedish roleplaying gaming association). 
<br>
<p>Of course, getting rid of all the copies of my Yog-Sothoth invocation
<br>
ritual from the net would be rather impossible by now. Beyond a certain
<br>
point a document becomes independent and leaves home...
<br>
<p>These are minor issues, but they are worth thinking about. To get back
<br>
to the main thread, my friend Ben pointed out to me that by now it would
<br>
be impossible for me to disawow any connection with transhumanism -
<br>
there are simply too much material around showing my great involvement,
<br>
so unless I want to do a general apology and claim I now have become a
<br>
true believer in bio-conservatism I will - for good and bad - be
<br>
associated with the term transhumanism. Which means that it would be
<br>
foolish for me to abandon it to what I consider malign influences (like
<br>
the prometheans), because it would still hurt me. So I better do what I
<br>
possibly can to keep the term transhumanism a positive word one can be
<br>
proud to apply to ones thinking.
<br>
<p>Seems it is not just we who have ideas, the ideas have us too.
