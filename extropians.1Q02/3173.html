I think a simplistic concrete example which would illustrate this is:
<br>
nature didn't actually design us to &quot;want children&quot;.  Well, it might
<br>
have more for women, but that's still open to debate.  Some people of
<br>
both sexes want children, but not all, and it's hard to separate out
<br>
cultural effects.  What we do know is that we're hardwired to want to
<br>
have sex, and from anecdotal reports I think a wired response of
<br>
affection upon seeing a newborn baby is also supportable.  But because
<br>
of the two-step process we can use birth control in the early &quot;no baby
<br>
in sight, don't want children much&quot; stage and not have children.  If
<br>
we'd been properly designed to Want Children, that wouldn't work.  But
<br>
we Want Sex instead.

<p><em>&gt; &quot;Hey humans, here's the deal.  You are genetically programmed to maximize

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal (maximizing the probability of the survival of your geneset--or in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other parlance being &quot;friendly&quot; to your genes).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that nature's honesty would have persuaded us to continue being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;friendly&quot; to our genes?  Or do you think we would still be saying &quot;Screw 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the survival of my geneset, I'm in this for the maximum enjoyment of my own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular phenotype&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Graydon of rec.arts.sf.written/fandom has an idea about embedded
<br>
creationist memes in our thinking and language.  We can call ourselves
<br>
an evolutionist or atheist, and be an evolutionist and atheist, but it's
<br>
hard to make all of our ideas match up.  It's like being a round peg in
<br>
a round hole, then becoming a square peg.  You're still in a round
<br>
hole... &quot;natural rights&quot; is an easy example; the idea comes from
<br>
Christian and Deist thinkers and lacks any equivalent support in hard
<br>
materialist terms, but is still extremely pervasive.
<br>
<p>And more obscurely, I think there's a similar 'creationist' fog around
<br>
the concept of intelligence.  An instinct that something recognizable as
<br>
intelligent in being able to think and talk must have a soul similar to
<br>
us in other respects.  Natural enough in a way, since extrapolating from
<br>
our own human nature is the first shortcut to understanding other
<br>
humans, but still wrong.  Intelligence is a tool.  Self-awareness is a
<br>
tool.  They are not package deals, bringing with them self-respect,
<br>
self-centeredness, a John Galtian yearning to be free and independently
<br>
creative.  Just because a being is aware of itself doesn't mean it cares
<br>
about itself, anymore than being aware of sparrows means you care about
<br>
sparrows.  That concern is a separate mechanism, which would not be the
<br>
top priority of an AI you don't want to go rogue.
<br>
<p>We do not have some transcendant concern for the enjoyment of our
<br>
phenotype.  Our various enjoyments are effects, direct or indirect, of
<br>
the mechanisms given us by nature to propagate our genes.  Given how
<br>
quickly we've changed our own conditions, not all of the mechanisms work
<br>
fully now.  If nature had been more explicit in wiring us to care about
<br>
our geneset there wouldn't be any conflict between its honesty and our
<br>
concern for our phenotypic enjoyments; the geneset would be our top
<br>
priority, period.
<br>
<p>Most _humans_ aren't John Galt.  Quite a few prefer to serve others, if
<br>
their dignity is respected: loyal servants, self-sacrificing wives or
<br>
husbands, religious devotees.  The range of AI motivations is not going
<br>
to be less than that of human motivations.
<br>
<p>I think a lot of -- most? -- people who'll explicitly state they believe
<br>
they're a biological machine have not really implicitly incorporated that.
<br>
The implicit beliefs and reflexes reflect an image of an AI, or of human
<br>
nature, with its own inherent desires, independent of the human or
<br>
evolutionary process which designed it.  The proper image should be of a
<br>
machine which could have been built to do, or at least aim for,
<br>
anything.  Humans, of course, were not designed with much foresight or
<br>
coherent vision.
