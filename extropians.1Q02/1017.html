&quot;Attention General 'LeMay' Lorrey, call back your B-52 email bombers!!&quot;  &quot;Secretary of War Hal Finney has new intelligence regarding the supposed enemy!&quot;

Did you pay for your account?  Most companies I have worked for do not

provide technical support to the people who use the free versions of

their products.  They view those more as advertising which will lead
<br>
to people eventually being willing to pay.
<br>
<p>Of course even a free product is not good advertising if it does not work.

I personally have a free Hush account (although I've never used it for
<br>
much) and got through the 2.0 transition OK.  So I guess the software
<br>
is not 100% broken.  Perhaps your account got corrupted in the transition.

<p>&quot;General Lorrey, are you getting this message?&quot;  &quot;General Lorrey.......?&quot;        
<br>
<p>&quot;May God have mercy on the souls in the Land of Hush, because General Lorrey sure won't have any, if he doesn't get this message in time!&quot;
<br>
<p>END OF TRANSMISSION:

<p>John :)
