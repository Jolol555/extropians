<em>&gt; If we take the Bin Laden case, its obvious we have a clear enemy whose

<p>And even this, we can't be too sure about.
<br>
<p>Is it not feasible that the US Government, in an attempt to
<br>
bring their influence into the Middle East in order to side
<br>
with Israel against Palestine, decided to approach a known
<br>
terrorist organization and say &quot;we will assist in your
<br>
destroying the Twin Towers in exchange for a public military
<br>
assaunt on your known headquarters&quot; ... thus creating enough
<br>
deflection from what we're really setting out to do: strongarm
<br>
the Palestinians out of the territory Israel wants to claim.
<br>
<p>On 9/11, amongst a group of friends, I did a &quot;thumb in the air&quot;
<br>
estimate of how many casualties there would be in the WTC area.
<br>
My count was 6000, just based on what I knew of the number of
<br>
people in the buildings and the area.  I don't think I was too
<br>
far off, looking back  now.
<br>
<p>I'd say the government's analysts have much better data, and
<br>
analytical skills than I do, so they probably had a much more
<br>
accurate number than my wild-ass guess.  So, they knew what
<br>
their &quot;cost&quot; would be for this deal.  6000 of our people
<br>
to save tens of thousands of Israeli and Palestinean casualties
<br>
if they indeed go to full war over this matter ... seems like
<br>
a fair trade-off.
<br>
<p>And if people think that our government wouldn't make that
<br>
kind of trade-off because they didn't take down the passenger
<br>
planes and kill several hundred people in order to save
<br>
6000 people in the WTC towers, think it over carefully.  There
<br>
must have been something even more worthwhile at stake for
<br>
them to allow 6000 people to die that day, otherwise the
<br>
decision to take the planes down, albeit a very hard one,
<br>
would have been made in the favor of less casualties.
