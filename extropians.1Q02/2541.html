<p>The reason for this needs to be determined.  I've always thought
<br>
there might be a number of possibilities.
<br>
1) A loss of cells producing GH (neurons die with age).
<br>
2) A decrease in protein production efficiency with age, say
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to the accumulation of junk like lipofuscin in the cells.
<br>
3) A decrease in the energy available for protein production with age,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to an increase in mitochondria with damaged DNA.
<br>
4) A decrease in protein manufacturing capability due to homologous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recombination repair between ribosomal-RNA &quot;repeats&quot; in the genome
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causing a physical loss of raw ribosomal blueprints from which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ribosomes can be produced.
<br>
5) Explicit downregulation of GH production.
<br>
<p>Obviously there can be complex interactions between 2-4, perhaps
<br>
promoting 1.  This can also be &quot;systemic&quot;.  If GH declines and
<br>
causes liver production of albumin to decline and albumin is
<br>
required for the adequate production of GH, then you get locked
<br>
into a downward spiral (note that I don't *know* this is the case,
<br>
I'm speculating here).  Rafal might comment on the degree to

</em><br>
<p><p>IIRC, GH spikes start falling off quite early - around 30.  That would argue
<br>
against most of 1-4.  I wasn't aware 4 happened.  What's the timeframe on
<br>
that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, if I recall some presentations at the A4M meetings a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years ago correctly, it isn't GH per se that is the source
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the problem, its GHRH that is the primary player.
</em><br>
<p>As in, response to GHRH holds up, it's the GHRH spikes which fall off?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I also seem to recall a presentation at the AGE conference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last year where there was a PharmaCo that had a drug that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mimiced GHRH but it was shelved because one can't apply for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drug approvals to treat aging because aging isn't a disease.
</em><br>
<p>Goofy on one level, but then even if aging were recognized
<br>
as a disease, how do you measure it?  Better to test and
<br>
market these things as preventing loss of muscle strength,
<br>
osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, memory loss, etc.  Something
<br>
with a significant effect on aging in general (to the extent that
<br>
that means something) will show up on some of those nice
<br>
crisp markers.  We won't lose anything useful.
