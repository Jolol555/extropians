<p>Fine. Let's re-phrase my point, then: the &quot;modules&quot; that make up 
<br>
transhumanism are more easily &quot;pick-and-choosable&quot; (apart from the central 
<br>
one concerning overcoming human limitations, of course) than those that make 
<br>
up extropianism. The extropian &quot;modules&quot;, on the other hand, are more 
<br>
consistent, more strongly connected to each other from the political point 
<br>
of view, exactly because extropy was created by transhumanists that happen 
<br>
to gravitate roughly in the same (libertarian) political area.
<br>
<p>And that is also the reason why I see no fundamental contradiction in almost 
<br>
any other political group carrying out the same operation, i.e. adopting 
<br>
transhumanism &amp; adapting it to their own goals. A nazi (for instance!) could 
<br>
decide to describe himself as a transhumanist with relatively little effort, 
<br>
while he would have to cope with some serious cognitive dissonance if he 
<br>
decided to call himself an extropian! Same thing for somebody of leftist 
<br>
leanings (see J. Hughes).
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong, this is not necessarily a bad thing (despite the 
<br>
possibility of the emergence of a few embarassing transhumanist groups). As 
<br>
I said in my previous post, one day transhumanism might well be taken for 
<br>
granted and we might see substantial transhumanist groups of all political 
<br>
shades. The same is less likely to happen with extropianism.
<br>
<p>My bet is that in another few years left and right wing Singularitarians 
<br>
will begin to appear too (unless they already exist and I just never heard 
<br>
of them).
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
