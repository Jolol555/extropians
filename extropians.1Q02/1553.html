Funny you should mention that....  I've been thinking about the &quot;long view&quot;
<br>
of my life.  It very well could happen that immortality never becomes
<br>
mainstream.  Even if it does, it could take a very long time.  Or even if it
<br>
comes quickly, we will be the founders or the originators with everyone else
<br>
being some sort of late-comers.  A small group of us will be all that
<br>
remains of the original transhuman generation.  We will be the only
<br>
survivors after an entire generation is wiped out or saved.  In any case, we
<br>
will be an odd minority with a different history and background than anyone
<br>
else.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I have definitely thought about this, too!  And it is sad to think many transhumanists enjoyed here may be lost because they did not sign up for cryonics.  Hey, I'm the one here who believes in God and an afterlife! lol  And just think, every extropian reanimated will be a good excuse to have a party!    
<br>
<p>I do suspect a large amount of bandwidth in the &quot;extrolist of 2050&quot; will involve a lot of &quot;I told you so&quot; and &quot;remember what you said back then!&quot;  An arms race of cognitive enhancement may occur among future list members, as they attempt to best each other with an ongoing competition and fusion of ideas, facts and opinions.    
<br>
<p>I enjoy your final line in the paragraph.  We will *hopefully* be seen as pioneers and not just an odd minority! lol  I could even envision a lot of scholarly biological and machine minds writing scads of papers about us.  I hope they can even find the words of Eliezer which I paraphrased the other day!
<br>
<p>you continue:
<br>
It is almost as if we are aliens here, just passing through.  Or we are
<br>
immortals for whom a brief flash of a single generation seems less
<br>
important.  While the rest of the generations come and go, we may be the
<br>
only long-term relationships we have in the future.  Or if a whole
<br>
generation becomes immortal, we will be the oldest or the first of that
<br>
generation.  We may be more advanced than the rest of the world, or left
<br>
behind as a future evolves off in an unexpected direction.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Yes.  Events could go down a number of different paths!  I think even extropians can sometimes experience future shock, and so the community bonds here could really help bolster people to hang in there, and make it to what ever world turns out.  Pro-Act will hopefully be successful in helping to make that world an exciting and open one.

In any case, I see this group of people as family.  We are all far-flung
<br>
cousins that cannot simply be ignored.  Even if we disagree on some points,
<br>
we will have to learn to get along.  It's a small universe and we're going
<br>
to keep running into each other.  It is almost as if we are stranded in a
<br>
small subculture that forever ties us together as different from anything
<br>
that preceded us or that might follow.  We will be a small band of travelers
<br>
into the future.  Even if the future is full of transhumans, our particular
<br>
group will be comparatively small.
<br>

<br>
<p>I feel the same way!  One big and moderately dysfunctional extropian family(with interesting friends to round things out).!  I love your comment about it being a &quot;small universe and we're going to keep running into each other.&quot;  Over the decades and centuries I can envision this happening! lol  There is a certain sanctity to your words &quot;we will be a small band of travelers into the future.&quot;  I feel very special to know this small band. :)          
<br>
<p>you concluded:
<br>
Any thoughts?  Or am I not getting enough caffeine again?
<br>
(end)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You now have mine.  And lay off the excessive use of caffeine! lol  The post you wrote was very touching to me, and I hope to keep it in mind over the next several decades(really).  I suppose the archives will &quot;time capsule&quot; it for a rereading after we arrive on the other side of where we want to go.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
