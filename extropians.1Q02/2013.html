<em>&gt;I don't see anything to disagree with here.  Do you want to try further to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convince me that competition is mostly bad?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Not that the net effects are mostly bad, but that most competition includes
<br>
negative effects which we can imagine are sometimes avoidable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Or that &quot;we&quot; should do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about it?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;If &quot;we&quot; means people who selflessly care about the wellbeing of the
<br>
average person, then I'm saying we should weigh the negative effects when
<br>
deciding our political attititudes, in much the same way we should be
<br>
weighing other negative effects such as pollution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; That's why life is so much better for everyone, including the worst off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  We can easily observe that some people are worse off than they were 10 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 20 years ago, by observing the efforts they make to avoid changes. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not disputing that there are short term ups and downs.  Is there something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we (or the government) should do differently because of that?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;One thing that we (extropians) ought to do differently is to base our
<br>
predictions of future opposition to new technologies on the assumption
<br>
that such opposition will be motivated by expected harm (as opposed to the
<br>
nearly useless hypothesis of stupidity that is somewhat popular here), and
<br>
to criticise luddites as selfish rather than as stupid people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps if we require that those aristocrats consider the possibilities from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behind Rawls' &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(<a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/o/origposi.htm">http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/o/origposi.htm</a>) they'd agree that people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better off, even though the aristocrats (being in the aristocracy) had nowhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to go but down.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Yes. I want to emphasize the difference between this and saying that
<br>
everyone is better off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Fine.  I wouldn't have argued for an objective answer.  But it seemed clear to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me that most here (including you) would have agreed that people who know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make buggy whips don't lose anything objective (anything they should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compensated for by the government or anything they should be able to sue for
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I do think they lose something objective, much like what a copyright holder
<br>
loses when a copyright expires. The existence of an objective loss doesn't
<br>
imply the existence of someone who ought to compensate the loser. A system
<br>
of compensation might cause less harm than some of the trade barriers that
<br>
governments create to protect jobs, but a better approach would be to create
<br>
futures markets whose prices communicate future wages in particular industries
<br>
and enable employees to hedge some of their risks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  It [...] seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be a symptom of the belief that because free markets are better than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; alternatives, we should ignore problems associated with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't believe I've said that we should ignore such problems.  If anyone
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt;That's fine.  I don't mind if you work on that.  I'm not bothered by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negative externalities.  I think the positive externalities at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compensate, broadly speaking.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Being not bothered by negative externalities sounds a lot like ignoring
<br>
them. Maybe that's appropriate when the negative externalities are an
<br>
inevitable consequence of what creates the positive ones, but in many
<br>
cases I doubt the connection between the two is inevitable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That seems like a remarkably precise estimate.  Even if I assume that it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ballpark number, what's the argument that reducing copyright duration from 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years to 3 (minus an &quot;or so&quot;) would significantly increase society's level of equality?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;It sure looks to me like copyrights create some payments which make a small
<br>
number of very successfull authors and actors quite rich, and I don't see
<br>
any offsetting egalitarian effects.
<br>
&nbsp;I don't know whether the net effect on equality would be significant,
<br>
but as long as there exists a point at which the marginal costs and
<br>
benefits of the other effects add up to zero, then any nonzero egalitarian
<br>
effect will have a nonzero effect on where the optimum lies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I wouldn't want people to lose interest in further wealth.  If someone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;earned 10s of millions of dollars by satisfying some desire of other people, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't think we benefit by convincing her that she should stop doing so.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might arguably benefit by convincing her that she doesn't need to earn 100 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1000 times what her employees do in order to tell that she's still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contributing something valuable.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I like this way of phrasing it.
