<p>Watch it there, J.R., or I am going to put on my Zombie Anti-Defamation League hat

hiring human workers who waste all those neuro cycles by thinking on the job.

<em>&gt; &gt; (By the way, in that same answer, Dennett states that expecting to get

<em>&gt; &gt; soon physical immortality through cell repair is a foolish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technocratic fantasy that bizarrely underestimate the complexities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of life.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you for mentioning that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't know Dennett was so very deserving of my respect and admiration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds like a real extropic scientist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now *that* I can go with.  If it were not for Dennett, I would still be under the
<br>
illusion that I am self-aware, as opposed to the simple realization that it just
<br>
seems that way.
<br>
<p>As for the statement above, it depends on how you think about the words &quot;soon&quot; and
<br>
&quot;immortality.&quot;  Life extension through cell repair is happening now in those who
<br>
practice CR and/or are using nutritional means to support it.  Living longer means
<br>
not dying before technology allows you to live yet longer.  When the rate of
<br>
advance in biotechnology pushes life extension past one year per year, you could
<br>
argue for immortality.  I think that tipping point is within the projected life of
<br>
most who are alive today, so I would call that &quot;soon.&quot;
<br>
<p>But is extension immortality?  Well, &quot;immortality&quot; is problematic in the first
<br>
place.  It implies a future time without bound, which requires you to first ask if
<br>
time is without bound, and then if so, what could go along with it?  Although we
<br>
know from experiments that the proton can maintain its pattern for a very long
<br>
time, we do not know if a proton is immortal.
<br>
<p>Another problem with claims to immortality is the death through change property.
<br>
I have a step-son who is a teenager now, but I well remember playing with him when
<br>
he was three years old.  Although he is still alive, that three year old is gone.
<br>
I cannot play with him, and I cannot take his picture.  We do not call it death,
<br>
but I have empirical data that that three year old was not immortal.  If something
<br>
exists in a few hundred years that comes from who and what I am now, it will not
<br>
be like I am now.  In that way I am no more immortal than was my three year old,
<br>
all of technology notwithstanding.
<br>
