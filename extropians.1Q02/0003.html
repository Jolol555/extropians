<em>&gt; &gt; What I hear you saying is that the civilians (children, women, and men)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killed &quot;collateral damage&quot; have no one to blame but themselves and should

</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the degree that one is &quot;aware&quot; of a hazard one is &quot;personally responsible&quot;

</em><br>
<p>That did not answer the above question.  Not by a long shot. 
<br>
Being aware of a hazard and being able to do anything much to
<br>
avert it are quite different things.  Whether one has done as
<br>
much as possible, relative to the size of the hazard and one's
<br>
hierarchy of values, there is still no reason to simply die in
<br>
silence without complaint that I understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I* am aware of the hazard that comets and asteroids represent to humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (even though they can scarcely be labeled &quot;moral actors&quot;).  To the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not demonstrate &amp; lobby my government or send money to private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations (every day) to investigate and develop solutions for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem -- I am &quot;personally responsible&quot; for any deaths, including my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own, that may result from my inaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hardly.  Life is short and we have to pick our battles.  The
<br>
danger of a large asteroid or comet slamming into the earth in
<br>
your lifetime are pretty tiny compared to many other more
<br>
immediate dangers.  That it happens anyway despite the huge odds
<br>
against it cannot be held as something that you and the rest of
<br>
us are guilty for.   Now I would feel some guilt in such a
<br>
case.  But it is more guilt for not doing more to advance AI and
<br>
technology generally to the point where we did not have to be
<br>
sitting ducks.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am not suggesting that anyone should &quot;die in silence&quot;.  I am suggesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that placing the blame for their deaths on the U.S. *alone* is failing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at the larger picture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The people who were substantially afraid of the danger that U.S. bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented *migrated* to Pakistan (or other countries)!  The people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt they could not survive the possible famine facing Afghanistan moved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to refuge camps.  The people who chose not to rise up and eliminate the
</em><br>
<p>Where they could still face famine actually.  Some were too sick
<br>
or old to move.  Many did not go because they could not pay the
<br>
stiff (for the area) price demanded to pass into Pakistan. 
<br>
Those who did not go cannot be faulted necessarily.  We speak of
<br>
our &quot;smart bombs&quot; and do not even allow much independent
<br>
verification of civilian deaths from our campaings in
<br>
Afghanistan. Since we are dropping the bombs, and in some cases
<br>
dropping them on poor or non-existent military targets, we are
<br>
liable for these deaths.  They may or may not be avoidable.  We
<br>
may or may not be right to do some or all of the bombing we
<br>
did.  But it seems to imply it is the fault of the citizen if
<br>
they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It is
<br>
also folly to equate not standing up to a murderously repressive
<br>
regime with failing to bug your congress critters at every
<br>
possible opportunity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Soviets from Afghanistan 15 years ago set into play a complex political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chess game that created the Al Qa'eda, the Taliban, empowered bin Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and eventually caused the actions we see today.  If you let people use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you as a pawn -- then you are responsible for being used as a pawn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Pardon me but we set up many of those pawns ourselves.  Those
<br>
who create and manipulate the pawns are more responsible for the
<br>
expanded scope of their knowledge and ability to act than the
<br>
pawns themselves.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As I mentioned before -- I think the current situation in Argentina
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrates quite clearly what things should look like when people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are being &quot;responsible&quot; for a situation they find unacceptable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (That doesn't mean I think they know how to fix it -- it just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means they are actively contributing to whatever solution is developed.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I wonder.  Argentina plans to repudiate its debt after various
<br>
plans to restructure it were shot down.  Eleven days into his
<br>
term its leader steps down.  They have had four leaders in a
<br>
matter of weeks. It seems to me a lot of pressure is being
<br>
applied from many different directions and I doubt that much of
<br>
it came constructively from the people.  The country is in
<br>
trouble. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; _AND_ that as a citizen of the U.S. their deaths are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also my fault since I ostensibly have the power to prevent them since I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supposedly control the actions of my government's current (and past) foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state modification projects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the degree that you are not marching in Washington for peace -- yes --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are responsible for them.  (Remember I'm a child of the '60s -- I *know*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the power of a generation to change government policies).  To the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;we&quot; (collectively) as U.S. citizens (our our parents) thought of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia as the &quot;Great Satan&quot; and accepted the policies of our government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to combat that &quot;evil&quot;, we share the responsibility for the current situation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan (and any deaths that may occur in resolving it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm not buying your argument and the 40 civilians killed on Saturday and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 103 killed on Sunday aren't either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who are &quot;ignorant&quot; of the environment around them, e.g. children,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would label &quot;innocent&quot; victims.  Anyone who has knowledge of the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ranging from the Russian invasion of Afghanistan to CIA covert activities)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is responsible to the extent they simply &quot;accepted&quot; the situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Then we are in part responsible.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For some reason I was under the impression that Extropianism was a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism that had a very positive philosophy on the dignity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals as apposed to a state Social Darwinism agenda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a very positive philosophy, clearly trying to maximize human potential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The killing of &quot;innocent&quot; civilians can hardly be viewed as extropic.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on record for stating that what we should be doing is cryonically preserving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all &quot;terrorists&quot; until the technology becomes available to determine whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rational&quot; discussion can correct entrenched memes that are based on what should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most probably be viewed as a history of being brain washed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Or not. It might also be argued that the time lag would allow
<br>
cooler heads to see the relative merits and demerits of both
<br>
sides historically.  And once awakened some time in the future I
<br>
seriously doubt that any combatant, terrorist or not, would have
<br>
quite so much to fight about as many of the situations are no
<br>
more (hopefully).  I favor the idea, technology permitting, of
<br>
popping hopelessly hostile specimens into a very well designed
<br>
VR where they can work through their &quot;stuff&quot; in as many VR
<br>
lifetimes it takes before being brought back to the &quot;real&quot;
<br>
world.  A hi-tech &quot;Wheel of Karma&quot; if you will.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; To the extent that that cannot be accomplished at this time, I am willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerate certain civilians being caught in the line of fire in an effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I hope will result in a marginal increase in my personal security.
</em><br>
<p>In this particular case I am not tolerant of that because I
<br>
don't believe a lot of these actions are making me one bit safer
<br>
- if anything I think the world is becoming less safe as a
<br>
result of the full envelope of actions that this is just one
<br>
part of.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is pragmatic self-interest that motivates me.  I've written a paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the how bad bioterrorism might get -- it *is* very frightening --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its only a fraction of the risks we face (from &quot;natural&quot; Ebola to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear war to nanotech).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ebola, of course, makes a really poor bio-warfare weapon.  But
<br>
if we upset enough countries deeply enough we will be more
<br>
likely to face wars declared and undeclared that use any and all
<br>
weapons they can find.  It is not pragmatic to risk that if it
<br>
can be avoided.  Just the opposite.  We also need a non-war
<br>
footing desperately in the developed world for a few years to
<br>
finish giving birth to some relevant technologies without having
<br>
them first twisted to warfare.  We also require the intellectual
<br>
freedom that is fast being squeezed with decreasing opposition
<br>
because &quot;we are at war&quot;.  Without these things we are all in
<br>
most profound danger - more danger than from real terrorism
<br>
alone.
