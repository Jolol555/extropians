In a message dated 1/4/02 9:44:28 PM Pacific Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Heinlein%20(1946)%20on%20the%20Singularity">Spudboy100@aol.com</a> cites Mlorry:  What Heinlein and his contemporaries failed 
<br>
to forecast was the enormous economic drain that both the Cold War AND the 
<br>
'War on Poverty' would have, how this negatively impacted the level of 
<br>
investment in space exploration following the Apollo era, and how the loss in 
<br>
Vietnam would impact the national self-confidence for so long, and he did 
<br>
not, in 1946, forecast the sort of market manipulation the OPEC cartel could 
<br>
use to cripple the world economy for years.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Expanded Universes Heinlein gave his own analysis of where he had 
<br>
gone wrong.  He had grown up in a time when govenrnent had been organized to 
<br>
accomplish one or more really large projects and had been sucessful in doing 
<br>
so.  I don't recall his specific list but Oak Ridge, TVA, WW2 come easily to 
<br>
mind.  He believed that we as a society and a government would understand the 
<br>
wisdom of space exploration and had the organizational ability to 
<br>
accomplishment the goals he set out.  It didn't happen.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don't disagree with Mlorry -- I think we are talking about 
<br>
two different facets of the same diamond and that our viewpoints are 
<br>
complimentary not antagonistic.
