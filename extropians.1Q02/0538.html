It seems that most people on this list believe that Singulartity will arrive 
<br>
in time to save them. That medical advances will assuredlly keep them in fine 
<br>
fettle, so that when the technology is there, they will merely upload, ala 
<br>
Permutation City &amp; Diaspora.
<br>
<p>What if this doesn't occur in time? What if both the hardware and the 
<br>
software to accomplish this sea-change in life on old planet earth, doth take 
<br>
its own sweet time?
<br>
Will most of the Extropians hedge their bets and have themselves Alcor-ed?
<br>
<p>Like a moron crying in the wilderness, er-r, make that voice crying in the 
<br>
wilderness, I have urged Extropians to plan some rational contingencies. One 
<br>
rational contigency is that Singularity tech might take excruitiatingly, 
<br>
long, to achieve, and medical progress is too damn slow. My area of interests 
<br>
sre primarily physics and cosmology, as well as computationalism as possible 
<br>
solutions to be conducted by the uber minds of the distant future.
<br>
<p>I am deliberately projectiing my own feelings and world-view on this, but I 
<br>
maintain, that this area needs to be studied, if for no other reason then to 
<br>
maintain hope. Most people may not need this, or receive comfort and joy from 
<br>
attending 'revival meetings' and being 'slain in the spirit, groov'in on 
<br>
what's on ESPN, and the like. That is not me, anyway.
<br>
<p>Perhaps what I ask is too demanding, perhaps my focus is unappealiing 
<br>
compared to the 'bright futures just around the corner?' Or as the saying 
<br>
goes, &quot;ya can't dance at two weddings!&quot; But I have lived a fair amount of 
<br>
time, and have realized that so many golden futures and achievements that 
<br>
have been predicted, have wound up in the outhouse of history.
<br>
<p>I still believe that great things will be pursued and gained, but I see how 
<br>
darn long it all takes-electronics being the exception to the rule. But we do 
<br>
need to have hope (I believe) even for 'those asleep in the dust.'  
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Does anyone on the list have enough physics knowledge to comment
<br>
on *why* we need &quot;axions&quot; in the standard models?  (Other than as
<br>
explanations for cold dark matter -- which *we* know could be
<br>
JBrains and MBrains in traveling in &quot;silent running&quot; mode :-) )
