</em><br>
<p>You can interpret ideas as you want, but some interpretations are plain
<br>
wrong. They miss out fundamental parts of the idea and are no longer the
<br>
same idea - if somebody claims Christianity is worshipping five gods and
<br>
having rape as the highest virtue, or that the goal of socialism is to
<br>
paint the world blue - they are not merely interpreting these ideas
<br>
strangely but actually erroneously. 
<br>
<p>[ Here I could insert a rant about how the lack of error-checking in
<br>
much of modern critical studies has allowed this kind of &quot;anything goes&quot;
<br>
interpretation of everything to flourish, but I'm not going to go into
<br>
this at depth. ]
<br>
<p>My claim in the paper was that humanism is integral to the concept
<br>
transhumanism, and if you leave out the humanism part you are not
<br>
talking about transhumanism. Part of this is purely semantic, since the
<br>
humanism part of the term transhumanism ought to signify something. But
<br>
there is also ample historical reasons to see transhumanism not as
<br>
something invented from scratch in 1990 by Max More but a long
<br>
ideological stream in Western thought, and if one examines both the
<br>
extropian principles and transhumanist declaration one finds these
<br>
values enshrined therein. 
<br>
<p>That a lot of people claim to be transhumanists while not being the
<br>
least humanist is true, and this tends to confuse things. But the fact
<br>
that East Germany called itself Deutsche Demokratische Republik doesn't
<br>
mean that it was democratic. 
<br>
<p>To sum up: yes, I believe there is a one true transhumanism that has a
<br>
greater claim to the name than other ideologies (which is rather broad,
<br>
but has some core ideas you have to believe in to be a transhumanist). 
<br>
A definition of transhumanism as merely being in favor of radical
<br>
technological progress does not have the same claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It seems to me that the best way of reconciling the differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;between the different views is to recognize transhumanism as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;meta-ideology, not attempting to prescribe all aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;political ideology but providing an underlying set of values and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;assumptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ?Meta-ideology? is the correct description of transhumanism in my opinion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too, but I don?t think it?s possible to prescribe ?underlying sets of values 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and assumptions? anymore than it is to ?prescribe all aspects of political 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology?.
</em><br>
<p>Liberalism (classic European sense) has often been described as a
<br>
meta-ideology, in that it has no problem with people having their own
<br>
private ideologies and forming private communities with more specific
<br>
rules, as long as the overall society works according to a liberal
<br>
system of freedom. It clearly does not prescribe all aspects of
<br>
political ideology. But liberalism does have underlying values such
<br>
as freedom and human rights.
<br>
<p>In fact, the humanist transhumanism I described would act very similarly
<br>
to this. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Trying to bolt-on humanism (or any other ism) on what I called the ?central 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme of transhumanism? can indeed succeed in creating a movement that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combines the &quot;ism&quot; in question and the &quot;central meme of transhumanism&quot;, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it cannot prevent unsavoury ideological sides from carrying out the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation, because a nazist/communist/racist/etc could just adopt that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; central meme and discard the rest (including the word &quot;transhumanism&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself) without a second thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need to learn to let go of that &quot;central meme&quot; and concentrate instead on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoting our version of it (and stop pretending that ours is the only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible version).
</em><br>
<p>OK, we should let go of what you claim is the only thing defining
<br>
transhumanism, and then only promoting our own version of transhumanism,
<br>
with no assumption that it has anything to do with technology, humanism
<br>
or anything else, just our own (current) opinions? Isn't that throwing
<br>
it all away? 
<br>
<p>Again, as I tried to show in my paper, humanism is *not* a bolt on to
<br>
transhumanism in the same way a socialist transhumanism or a satanist
<br>
transhumanism would be. There is a stronger connection. You are
<br>
constantly misled by seeing the technology as the important part of
<br>
transhumanism, which means you have no defense at all when somebody
<br>
claims fascist transhumanism is as valid as your version. In fact, if
<br>
the fascist transhumanist manages to show that his society is better
<br>
than yours in creating hightech, he would be a better transhumanist than
<br>
you. Is that really the kind of ideological debate you want?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Finally, this (relative) ease of adoption of transhumanism?s ?central meme? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not be seen as a weakness, quite the opposite in fact and I'll try to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show why with an example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Italy, where I come from originally, federalism is continually in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news these days. Twenty years ago it was very much a fringe subject, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today all political parties  describe themself as federalist, to some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As illustrated in an Italian newspaper's satirical vignette: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man-in-the-street asks a politician: ?Are you federalist?? ?Of course!? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers the politician ??and I have been for over half an hour, now!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Replace federalist with (?central core?) transhumanist and, with a bit of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; luck, you could be looking into the world?s political situation of 2010.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Everybody is a transhumanist. The transhumanist eco guerrilas are
<br>
looking forward to a posthuman world without any humans in it.
<br>
Transhumanist dictators execute people for &quot;crimes against
<br>
transhumanity&quot;. The great transhumanist Berlusconi is celebrating his
<br>
re-election. Transhumanist social democrats redistribute research money
<br>
in Sweden: &quot;Since the natural sciences has already got so much funding,
<br>
we must make sure the transhumanist progress in gender and unemployment
<br>
research keeps up, so they can also reach a signularity&quot;. In the US the
<br>
transhumanist government is working on AI combined with genetic scanning
<br>
to identify potential terrorists before they are born and forcing the
<br>
womens to abort. The transhumanist catholic church is protesting this,
<br>
since abortion and indeed any form of birth control is anti-transhuman.
<br>
<p>Do you see the problem? I certainly don't want to live in a world where
<br>
transhumanism didn't mean anything. I want real achievement, not that
<br>
everybody claims to agree with me. 
<br>
<p>A friend of mine encountered a girl talking about feminism. When he
<br>
asked her what kind of feminist she was she couldn't tell him, and when
<br>
he listed a number of forms of feminism she still couldn't tell him. She
<br>
said &quot;But feminism is something individual, we all have to define it for
<br>
ourselves&quot;. &quot;Aha, *my* feminism is about the right to bear arms, take
<br>
drugs and watch pornography!&quot;. &quot;But that's not feminism!&quot; she cried. 
<br>
<p>Watch out for broad but shallow definitions.
