<em>&gt; I don't see any problem with this.  One of the things I think I said is

</em><br>

<p><p>This, again, is simply an assertion that there is no such

problem.  If you turn out to be wrong and there is no job at all 
<br>
for a significant part of the population, what then?  Should we 
<br>
just allow them to die and hope that we never end up one of them?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Increasingly it may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;economically feasible to hire and train people in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;companies, at least not people below a certain intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;level of training.  What then for these people who are no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hirable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [I assume &quot;companies&quot; is a typo for &quot;countries&quot;.]
</em><br>
<p><p>Why would you assume that?  It does not follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the charities I give to (as I've mentioned before) is Trickle Up.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loan $100 to the poorest of the poor in the poorest countries to start very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple businesses.  weaving baskets, repacking foods, watching other people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children.  These people then hire others.  (aside:) Having read de Soto's &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mystery of Capital&quot;, I now believe that in many of these countries one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biggest problems is that the poor can't get a loan on their home, even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are the undisputed owner of the property.  This is their biggest obstacle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to getting the small amount of capital that is required to start very simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; service businesses that contribute in substantial ways to their own and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbor's lifestyles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>This is commendable.  But the question remains of what happens 
<br>
when these measures prove inadequate.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When [immigrants] start a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;family, they'll yearn for the same comforts for their children as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;rest of us, and work as hard as it takes to make it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Personally, I still think the US can do a lot worse than provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;some reasonable stipend in the form of a grant (say 12,000/yr)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to every capable adult who wishes to continue his/her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;education.   The need is great to get a more educated population
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and workforce and we can't wait for &quot;trickle-down&quot; to have it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure this is good incentive engineering.  (Not that I disagree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goal, only with whether this is the most effective way to reach it.)  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people want an education (for themselves or their children) enough to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overtime to get it, they value what they get and manage it wisely.  If
</em><br>
<p><p>I know from personal experience just how extremely difficult it 
<br>
is to work fulltime and attend college.  Saying we should have 
<br>
people suffer more, many beyond their means to do so, so they 
<br>
will value it more is very uncaring imho.  Valuing something 
<br>
does not require having to work double-time (or more) to acheive 
<br>
it.  Putting up or allowing a barrier where some of those with 
<br>
the intelligence and desire to gain greater technical competence 
<br>
cannot do so or have an unnecessarily difficult time doing so 
<br>
does not seem to me to be in our interest at all.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; education is a gift or a right, many will squander it and not realize until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they finally are on their own that their choices make a difference.  That
</em><br>
<p><p>In a society utterly dependent on an educated population, all 
<br>
should have access to as much education as they can profitably 
<br>
learn from.  Anything less cheats all of us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; said, I do believe that education is important.  But my and my significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other's plan for our nieces and nephews is that we will save money (in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name, not in a trust account that we don't really control) that we will give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them as a match for whatever they earn themselves.  This multiplies their
</em><br>
<p><p>Wonderful.  What of those others who have no aunts and uncles, 
<br>
parents or other benefactors in such a position and with such 
<br>
generosity?  Are we to say it is ok to lose those minds, minds 
<br>
that may have been of great benefit?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best the government could do would be to allow any tax payer to take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deduction for any contribution to anyone's education.  Doesn't matter whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the student is related or not.  Same for corporations.  More education is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all of us, but making it an entitlement is bad for all of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't agree it is bad for all of us.  As these things go it is 
<br>
one of the few entitlements that I believe makes sense.  I would 
<br>
limit it in that those who take advantage of it must keep 
<br>
certain academic standards.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;The statistics (according to Julian Simon, of course) show that in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;?  I am not altogether sure I can trust Julian Simon for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;statistics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please, use any source of statistics you desire, or show any attacks on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simon's work that provide better statistics, rather than attacking his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation.  Do you have any sources that disagree that the gap keeps getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller?  I  think Simon's opponents are driven by envy, and think Simon's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims are irrelevant.  If there's still a gap, then they will continue to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhappy.  Is this how you feel?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>No.  I am unhappy because I personally know a great number of 
<br>
bright minds that are wasted and I recognize they are the tip of 
<br>
the iceberg.  I am unhappy because I personally know people 
<br>
working two jobs just to have ends beginning to me.  I 
<br>
personally know people who fell though the cracks of our society 
<br>
through no particular fault of their own.  So I am not awfully 
<br>
impressed when I see fine graphs saying everything is getting 
<br>
better.  I do not personally believe it.  I don't have the 
<br>
statistics to back it up but my gut says something is damn fishy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;cases, as technology advances, the rich do keep getting richer, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;gap keeps getting proportionately smaller.  Those who worry about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;have-nots, when they have statistics always show the ones that show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;some people are still behind, and don't check to see whether they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;catching up.  We can argue about gradualism again, but since we agree on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the outcome, there's no need to do so here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I do not find the above tenable.  Especially not now when even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;lot of very highly trained and motivated friends of mine are out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of work and have been for months.  Our system is not working all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that smoothly right now.  And I would also question relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;purchase power figures when it takes two wage earners in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and more households today to just break reasonably even, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;without a lot of consumerist over-spending, than it did in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;parent's generation.  It also takes longer in many parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;country and is accessible to fewer levels of income, to own a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;home of one's own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what the complaint is here.  There is a recession.  Do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone is unfairly targeting the poor and middle class to take the brunt of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it?  I also have trouble figuring out how your &quot;very highly trained&quot; friends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumably here in Silicon Valley, could be among the have-nots that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are worried about.  I must be missing the point of this paragraph.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>And where do you think the recession came from?  Is it an act of 
<br>
Nature?  The point is that even the highly-trained are very 
<br>
vulnerable and it is difficult to believe &quot;everything is getting 
<br>
better&quot; when even the best of us are that vulnerable.
