</em><br>
<p><p>In the postulated timeframe (1000+ years) the following
<br>
list is meaningful only to humans who for some reason have
<br>
explicitly decided to remain in human bodies. Even these
<br>
rustics (if they exist) will have reconfigurable MNT at
<br>
whatever level they choose. For the following, I assume
<br>
that each human will have 20 KG of reconfigurable MNT:
<br>
(MNT==Molecular nanotechnology) I cannot think of a plausible
<br>
scenario in which we die only by accident but have not
<br>
achieved MNT.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 1. Motor vehicle crashes Deaths per year: 43,200 
</em><br>
<p><p>reconfigure your MNT into a personal conveyance/body armor
<br>
much faster stronger, lighter and safer that a car. Since
<br>
most car travel is rendered unnecessary (no drive to work,
<br>
transport kids, get groceries) less exposure. crashes reduced
<br>
to almost zero. If there is a crash, MNT instantly reconfigures into
<br>
a perfect airbag in the perfect position--zero deaths.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2. Falls Deaths per year: 14,900 
</em><br>
<p><p>MNT &quot;clothing&quot; instantly reconfigures into airbag (for short
<br>
falls) or into a parachute and an airbag for longer falls.
<br>
The MNT surrounding the object you are falling onto (a major contributor
<br>
in most such accidents) also reconfigures into an airbag.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3. Poisoning by solids and liquids D/year: 8,600 
</em><br>
<p>most poisoning happens to children below age four. This is a
<br>
trivial percentage of a 1000+ year lifespan, and little kids
<br>
will surely be cherished, with lots of extra protection. Even
<br>
ignoring MNT medicine (which is a LOT harder than mots MNT,
<br>
advertising hype notwithstanding) a kid's MNT can still
<br>
disassemble and re-assemble all foods the kid tries to eat,
<br>
as the kid is eating it. No poisons.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 4. Drowning Deaths per year: 4,000 
</em><br>
<p><p>MNT reconfigures to a smart life preserver. Most drowning deaths
<br>
are young children. See above. MNT can also reconfigure to
<br>
create gill membranes as a matter of normal operation, not just
<br>
in an emergency
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 5. Fires and burns Deaths per year: 3,700 
</em><br>
<p><p>Smart structures don't burn.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 6. Suffocation Deaths per year: 3,300
</em><br>
<p><p>Mostly kids and bedclothes. Smart bedclothes don't
<br>
smother people.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 7. Firearms Deaths per year: 1,500
</em><br>
<p><p>The actual accidents in this category won't happen with
<br>
firearms that are even a little bit smart. mis-reported
<br>
suicides are a different problem.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 8. Poisoning by gases Deaths per year: 700 
</em><br>
<p><p>Usually associated with faulty backup heating systems, for
<br>
which there is no need given MNT.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 9. Medical &amp; Surgical Complications and Misadventures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deaths per year: 500 
</em><br>
<p><p>This one is complex, we started with an assumption of
<br>
life limited only by accidents, so presumable most
<br>
medical procedures go away.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 10. Machinery Deaths per year: 350 
</em><br>
<p><p>Mostly work-related. MNT should reduce to zero the need
<br>
for this type of machinery.
<br>
<p>Of course the big problem with the above is the attempt to
<br>
keep the lifestyle constant in today's terms while adding
<br>
MNT. In my opinion, A society of that accepts MNT but remains
<br>
meat humans is highly artificial.
