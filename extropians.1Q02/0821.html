<em>&gt;A Whole New Way of Seeing Things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By Erick Schonfeld
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.business2.com/futureboy/">http://www.business2.com/futureboy/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A lot of advanced technology is about eliminating the practical effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of distance. Now three engineers at a company called CDM Optics in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Boulder, Colo., have figured out how to eliminate the impact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distance has on the appearance of images that are viewed through a lens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In other words, CDM has created a lens that is always in focus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Before I get into just how extraordinary this is, a little bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;background about optics might be in order. Conventional lenses have what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is known as a depth of field, or a range of distances from the lens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which objects will appear in focus. For instance, in the first image of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the crayons below, the ones in the middle are in focus, but those on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;edges are blurry. The depth of field is confined to the center of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;image, and the lens can't focus on anything that's closer or farther
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away. You can change the depth of field by moving the elements of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lens, and that's how cameras work -- you adjust the lens with your hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or, more commonly in autofocus cameras, it can be adjusted by tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Conversely, CDM's new lens never requires adjustment by either hands or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motors, because the optical rules that govern depth of field no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apply. Instead, the range of distances within which the images are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;focus is so large that it doesn't matter how far the object is from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lens (as can be seen in the second image of the crayons shown here).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would anyone want such a lens? R.C. &quot;Merc&quot; Mercur, one of CDM's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;co-founders, spouts a laundry list of industrial applications, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high-end microscopes, surgical endoscopes, and satellite reconnaissance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cameras. As a benefit for consumers, the lens could also go into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremely small cameras embedded in everything from cell phones to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laptops to TVs. Since the lens requires no moving parts, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much cheaper to produce than conventional lenses. And that, in turn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could open up a whole new realm of camera-enhanced devices that wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;require battery-draining motors. Mercur and his partners at CDM, Thomas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cathey and Ed Dowski, claim that an entire camera, if produced in high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volumes for millions of devices, would theoretically cost about $1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Back in the early 1990s, Dowski was a young radar engineer who enrolled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the University of Colorado to study imaging systems under Cathey,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then a professor at the university. The two of them came up with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea of applying the algorithms used in radar signal processing to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;field of optics. In radar, these algorithms resolve the ambiguity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between determining the speed and the precise location of a moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;object. The ambiguity in optics is between depth of field and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illumination, which increases as the amount of available light
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decreases. Dowski thought that, by applying some mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulation, he could resolve this ambiguity and cancel out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blurring effects of distance on images -- just like canceling out Xs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an algebra equation. &quot;I personally didn't have nearly the experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone trained classically in optics,&quot; he says. &quot;So I didn't know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what we were trying to do was impossible.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's a good thing too, because the task turned out to be entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible, when approached the right way. Dowski and Cathey came up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a two-step process. First they created a phase mask -- basically a piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of plastic with a rippled, undulating surface like that of a potato chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- and attached it to an ordinary lens. This redirected the light that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hit the lens to create a coded image that compensated for the effects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distance. The only problem was that the mask also caused every object in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the image to be uniformly blurry. So the second step was to take that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blurry image and run it through a digital signal processor, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ones used in radar equipment, to decode the image and produce one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was sharply in focus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mercur helped found the precursor to satellite-equipment manufacturer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ball Aerospace and Technology, and he joined up with Cathey and Dowski
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to form CDM Optics with an eye toward commercializing the lens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology. &quot;We founded the company five years ago,&quot; he reports, &quot;and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spent the first three years convincing optical people this wasn't snake
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oil.&quot; Now CDM Optics has a licensing arrangement with German
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microscope-maker Carl Zeiss, which is designing the lens into high-end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microscopes. CDM Optics currently generates revenues of about $1 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a year from its licensing arrangements, contract design services, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modest product sales. And it's planning to build a small production line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to manufacture the lenses in bulk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Whether or not those lenses will ever see the light of day in anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other than microscopes is open to debate. Mercur would argue that CDM's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lenses &quot;will give a better picture, wider angle of view, smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt;envelope, and a cost advantage&quot; compared with conventional lenses. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also thinks the lenses could be adapted for use in specialized label
</em><br>
<em>&gt;readers, industrial robotic inspection systems, medical equipment, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;miniature cameras. The challenge now is to get potential customers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see the same thing.
