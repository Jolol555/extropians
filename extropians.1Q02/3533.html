Hi. My name is Anders Sandberg and I'm an Alpha Centauri addict. :-)
<br>
<p>SMAC has some very transhumanist themes, not just the transcendence
<br>
scenario. The progress of the ecological technologies contains a very
<br>
interesting idea about how the relationship with nature can change:
<br>
first it is the enemy, then we learn more about it and it becomes a
<br>
resource, then it becomes something that is vulnerable and must be
<br>
protected, and finally it becomes united with technology, economy and
<br>
eventually mankind itself. Even without the somewhat romantic ideas
<br>
about the sentient planet this progress has many interesting sides. 
<br>
<p>My main complaint is that all these new technologies doesn't really
<br>
change the world - you still have cities, army units and mines even
<br>
when your devices are nanotech with AI powered by controlled
<br>
singularities. I would really like to create a game where such
<br>
developments really changed the way everything worked, but I realize
<br>
this might be extremely tricky to do game balance-wise and in a way that
<br>
non-initiated players would understand. 
<br>
<p>One day - when I have time - I would dearly love to participate in
<br>
writing a game like SMAC with truly transhuman technologies and more
<br>
interesting personality simulations of the opponents. 
<br>
<p><p>Another game that has some transhuman content (at least in my mind) is
<br>
Sentinel. You are a robot that can only turn around, and can absorb the
<br>
mass/energy of trees and rocks in the landscape, and create new robots
<br>
at remote locations. Movement is by uploading to the other robot. The
<br>
goal is to reach the highest point where the Sentinel is standing; it is
<br>
trying to dissipate the mass/energy in the landscape and drains you if
<br>
it can see you. In a sense this eerie game is the battle between entropy
<br>
and extropy: you want to collect all available energy for constructive
<br>
use, the Sentinel tries to dissipate it. 
<br>
