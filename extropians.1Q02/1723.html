<em>&gt; I think you miss the point, Harvey: &quot;work&quot; is, by definition, time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent in pursuits other than what would be one's first choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what to do with that time.
</em><br>
<p>Then you need to find a better job.  Sure work is not fun, but it's not as
<br>
bad as death.  I love my job with my partner and our own corporation.  I
<br>
hope it is still going 100 years from now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you work for 12 hours to earn enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increase your lifespan by only 8 hours, then you haven't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased your &quot;life&quot; span at all--just your &quot;work&quot; span. You've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually lost 4 hours of &quot;life&quot;--life is doing what /you/ want with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your time.
</em><br>
<p>What I want is to see the future.  I want my demise to be a late as
<br>
possible.  I hope to find better medical care the longer I wait.  I would
<br>
never trade real years of life for a &quot;quality&quot; improvement.  I rather work
<br>
until I'm 100 rather than retire at 50 and die at 60.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is another possible counter-argument: if extending the end-point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of one's existence (even at the expense of &quot;life&quot; time as defined above)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently increases the likelihood of technology becoming available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes up for the work spent getting there, then you've won the bet.
</em><br>
<p>That's a bet I'm willing to take.  I do believe that future technology will
<br>
be much more advanced than today.  The doubling time for biology knowledge
<br>
is under two years now.  That means that delaying death just a couple of
<br>
years might double my chances of survival.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, the choice is not between dying and spending money: the choice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between spending, say, 3 years working to get 1 &quot;extra&quot; year of free time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or just spending 1 year working and 2 years in free time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly.
</em><br>
<p>I would never trade my life for some free time.  Why not retire now, live on
<br>
welfare, and die early if you desire free time?  I rather work hard and keep
<br>
going for a very long time.  I have a very strong survival instinct.  I
<br>
can't see giving up and dying just because it's easier.  If I can work
<br>
harder and prolong my life, I want to do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible factor in that equation is one's enjoyment of work: if one's work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very close to what one would otherwise choose to do anyway, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time lost can be discounted by some rate, possibly making it a good deal.
</em><br>
<p>I can't imagine having a job I hated so much that I would wish for an early
<br>
death rather than keeping my job.  This sounds almost suicidal.  No matter
<br>
what level of comfort I have, I will probably keep working toward getting to
<br>
the *next* level.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your insights!  They are perfectly wonderful and logical, but
<br>
based on different choices than my own.  It is always fascinating to see
<br>
alternative world views.
