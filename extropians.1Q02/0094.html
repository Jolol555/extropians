<br>
<em>&gt; If you continue to find it silly to ponder why bad things happen to you, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only will be taken by surprise every time, but won't understand how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change your behavior to make such things less likely.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds like excellent advice...
<br>
for the Taliban and Al Quaida,
<br>
&nbsp;since much worse things have happened to them than to the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolish to ignore the reason a person would take &quot;a sacred vow to kill you&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>It would be even more foolish to ponder the reason a person would &quot;take a
<br>
sacred vow to kill you&quot; instead of doing something about it. Those who sit
<br>
around speculating about the motives of suicidal/homicidal maniacs might feel
<br>
very wise in their last moments of life before being killed, but those who
<br>
take action to defend themselves can feel even more wise because they have
<br>
saved their own lives. The more mature you are, the quicker you will
<br>
understand this and stop endlessly denying the reality that terrorists must
<br>
first be rendered harmless before it makes sense to psychoanalyze them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is only one, that tactic may work, but we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already know that there is a whole movement.
</em><br>
<p>Ha ha ha ha... very funny.
<br>
&quot;a whole movement&quot; should read &quot;a hole movement&quot; since the terrorists have
<br>
been confined to holes in the ground. Some &quot;movement&quot;!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In the long term, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only two ways not to lose:  modify one's behavior so as not to provide even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remotely valid reasons for joining said movement, or kill everyone who may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have sympathy for those who are martyred for said movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which one seems better to you?
</em><br>
<p>You're wrong. There are three ways to win. The third way is to do exactly what
<br>
the US has done, namely, gain the support of the entire civilized world in the
<br>
war against terrorism. Only ignorant and obstinate ideologues will continue to
<br>
take the side of the terrorists.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
