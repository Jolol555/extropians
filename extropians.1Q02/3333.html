<p>No; writing was invented long before - around 4100-3800 BCE. The
<br>
sumerians, egyptians and babylonians were writing thousands of years
<br>
before the idea of monotheism became fashionable. The first big monotheist
<br>
religion was Zoroastrism, which emerged around ~1400 BCE. Judaism maybe
<br>
emerged from around 2000 BCE onwards, hinduism evolved around 1500 BCE,
<br>
buddhism around 600 BCE. Christianity emerged around 100 CE, and islam
<br>
around 600 CE. Overall, the emergence of new religions appear rather
<br>
evenly spaced. However, the ideas that are incorporated may have emerged
<br>
elsewhere and in far older times.
<br>
<p>I would really like to know what happend 500-400 BCE - look at the number
<br>
of extremely influential philosophers suddenly popping up worldwide; the
<br>
important greek ones in the West, Sun Tzu, Confucius, Buddha etc. Why so
<br>
many at this time? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There would have been a special awe for written works back then when the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology was still new.
</em><br>
<p>True. This is especially noticeable in the &quot;people of the book&quot;, the
<br>
judeo-christian-islamic sphere. Here greek ideas about the nature of
<br>
reality as words/text/information get linked with religion in a very
<br>
strong sense. No wonder cabala and &quot;magic&quot; using sacred books (swearing on
<br>
bibles, placing sacred scriptures as protections) became popular.
