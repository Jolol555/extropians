An interesting little paper in Nature:
<br>
<p>Cryopreservation: Fertility after intact ovary transplantation 
<br>
Nature 415, 385 (2002) 
<br>
XIANG WANG*, HUIFANG CHEN*, HANG YIN†, S. SAMUEL KIM‡, SEANG LIN TAN† 
<br>
&amp; ROGER G. GOSDEN† 
<br>
<p>They transplanted ovaries from rats:
<br>
<p>&quot;We used eight fresh organs for transplantation and also seven
<br>
treated ones that we had perfused for 30 min at 0.35 ml min-1 with M2
<br>
medium containing 0.1 M fructose and increasing concentrations of
<br>
dimethylsulphoxide (0-1.5 M). Following a protocol previously used
<br>
for sliced ovarian tissue4, we cooled the treated organs slowly in
<br>
5-ml cryovials (Nalgene), inducing ice nucleation at -7 °C in the
<br>
modified chamber of an automated freezer (CryoLogic). After overnight
<br>
storage in liquid nitrogen, we rapidly thawed the vials and removed
<br>
the cryoprotectant by perfusion with a reversed concentration
<br>
gradient (for further details, see supplementary information).&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;All animals with fresh transplants reinitiated oestrus. They had
<br>
normal numbers of ovarian follicles, including graafian stages (Fig.
<br>
1a), and uterine weights and FSH levels were similar to those of
<br>
controls (9.7 0.5 and 9.1 0.4 ng ml-1, respectively). Four animals
<br>
with cryopreserved grafts (57%) had follicular ovaries, and their
<br>
corpora lutea indicated recent ovulation (Fig. 1b). One animal was
<br>
pregnant, with two healthy fetuses implanted on either side of the
<br>
uterine anastomosis (Fig. 1c). This group had higher serum FSH levels
<br>
(21.3 6.2 ng ml-1), fewer follicles and lower oestradiol levels and
<br>
uterine weights, but none was in the castrate range. Tubal and
<br>
uterine morphology were indistinguishable from unoperated controls.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;These results are encouraging, but indicate that ovarian function is
<br>
compromised to some extent by freezing, perhaps because of
<br>
intravascular ice formation - a problem that has previously
<br>
frustrated attempts to cryopreserve kidneys5. Advances in
<br>
vitrification may overcome this problem if the chemical toxicity of
<br>
additives can be minimized6. Frozen banking of reproductive organs
<br>
could eventually be useful in breeding from endangered species and as
<br>
a fertility option for women and children who have undergone
<br>
sterilizing chemotherapy7, 8. Our success with ovarian transplants
<br>
should stimulate investigation into the improvement of
<br>
cryopreservation techniques for other organs.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>OK, hardly cryonics heaven, but a small step forward. I guess it is
<br>
not that impressive since rat ovaries aren't that large and hence
<br>
easier to freeze.
