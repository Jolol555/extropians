<p>True, but the proponents of the warming theory say that the warming is
<br>
primarily occuring at the poles, not the equator, and specifically at
<br>
the North Pole, where the sea ice is melting. The the evidence they tout
<br>
shows that seasonal differences will DECREASE with warming, with less
<br>
severe storm activity, so warming just makes northern winters more
<br>
tolerable, while reducing summer hurricane and tornado activity.
<br>
<p>If the equator warms up, then the equatorial rainforests that these same
<br>
chicken littles have been claiming has been 'dissapearing' will increase
<br>
with warmer weather and higher CO2 levels faster than normal.
<br>
<p>The fact is, though, that northern hemisphere warming, as recorded by
<br>
weather stations, is primarily an artifact of the fact that weather
<br>
stations are predominantly near urban centers, so while LOCAL pollution
<br>
may be causing LOCAL warming as a sort of thermal 'lake effect' near
<br>
cities, the predominance of urban weather centers biases the data, and
<br>
it is improper to ascribe continent-wide world-wide climate change when
<br>
there is so much thermal noise generated by urban centers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Much perfectly good land is covered with ice, whereas there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very little land on this planet that is too hot for life.  The equator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teems with life, the poles are nearly barren.  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of that has to do with the geometrical facts of insolation.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equator gets a lot more sunlight than the poles.
</em><br>
<p>But the pollution is not released at the poles, it is primarily released
<br>
at temperate latitudes, and wind currents and coriolis forces drive this
<br>
to the poles, which is why the modern data that the chicken littles
<br>
depend on actually shows that there is no temperature change at the
<br>
equator, and a 2 degree change at the poles, for an average of 1 degree
<br>
warming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if there are really big ice caps sucking up ocean water, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continental shelf gets exposed.  I saw an idea once that Eden/Flood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories might stem from &quot;we used to gather our food, and then the water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came in and it sucked&quot;, along with the Eden in the Bible (convergence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four rivers) being currently several miles offshore in the Persian Gulf.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you are gonna be non-scientific and start relying on the Bible,
<br>
then we really can't continue this conversation.
<br>
<p>For informational purposes, people didn't get kicked out of eden by a
<br>
flood, they got kicked out by a flaming sword (likely one or more of the
<br>
periodic aryan nomad invasions through the region). The flood happened
<br>
long after, and likely is a recounting of the 5600 BC flooding of the
<br>
Black Sea basin when the Bosporus was breached by rising Mediterranean
<br>
sea levels (due, again, to the continuing melting of ice after the last
<br>
ice age)
