Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>This is a very powerful autobiographical story Olaf Henny shared on cryonet.  This man as a boy resisted the intense pressures to join the Communist youth organization of his day.  I am astonished he could have had such wisdom and inner strength at such a young age.  If anyone deserves to be put in biostasis to see the future, it is Olaf Henny.  I believe the citizens of the future will be as astonished by him as the people of the present-day.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John

Subject: Message #18258 from Mike Darwin
<br>
References: &lt;<a href="mailto:20020101100001.63313.qmail@rho.pair.com?Subject=Re:%20Olaf%20Henny,%20the%20rarest%20of%20people...">20020101100001.63313.qmail@rho.pair.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>I am responding to Mike Darwin's posting concerning the
<br>
significant achievements of Leni Riefenstahl in cinematic opinion
<br>
forming, without the benefit of having read any of the books
<br>
about her.  However I have personally been exposed to the
<br>
euphoric atmosphere her film productions created among the German
<br>
public.  Even though I was just a small child at the time, I
<br>
sensed the powerful, uplifting impact they had on the adults in
<br>
my life.
<br>
<p>While the architect Albert Speer designed the monumental setting
<br>
of the parade grounds featured in &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, he was
<br>
not the founder of the propaganda technique used in her films.
<br>
That was clearly the creation of 'Reichspropagandaminister Dr.
<br>
Joseph Goebbels', an unequalled genius in mass manipulation.  His
<br>
technique was later also widely used by the communist leadership.
<br>
I was exposed to it on both sides, as an enthusiastic and willing
<br>
target by the Nazis* and later as a hostile exposed to communist
<br>
propaganda.  The power of it is enormous.
<br>
<p>Just a quick introduction to my situation at the time: In 1950 I
<br>
was one of only seven students in my school, who were still
<br>
refusing to join the FDJ, the communist youth organization, and
<br>
found myself under immense pressure to do so.  Instead I changed
<br>
schools and ended up in a class, where there were 6 of us still
<br>
on the outside.  Only a couple of month thereafter I was again
<br>
the lone resisting student in my class.  I was clearly no friend
<br>
of the system.
<br>
On occasion of the May 1st 1951 Workers Day
<br>
parade, we were marching in true totalitarian style, ten or
<br>
fifteen abreast, past a stage occupied the then president of the
<br>
GDR, Wilhelm Pieck, and his entourage. Chanting all around us,
<br>
the loudspeaker proclaimed: &quot;The president of the German
<br>
Democratic Republic salutes the students of the Goethe Schule
<br>
(our school)&quot;.  Around me everybody was clapping with hands
<br>
raised above their heads.  It was mass frenzy and although I
<br>
resented the guy, as I have resented few in my life, my impulse
<br>
at the time was to raise my hands and join in the clapping.  I
<br>
resisted and clenched my briefcase instead, but I realized then
<br>
how profound the impact of mass manipulation can be.
<br>
<p>It does not work in our present situation, because the profound
<br>
&nbsp;building of a new world by a new generation  concept is missing
<br>
or no longer credible as a mass movement setting.  In communism
<br>
it was the  new world, where everybody has equal rights and
<br>
shares in the wealth for a better and brighter future.  With the
<br>
Nazis it was the  prosperous future achieved through healthy
<br>
living and strengthening of body and mind in order to evolve into
<br>
a stronger people .
<br>
<p>Those, who were not there, and know of Nazi atrocities will have
<br>
difficulty understanding the mind set of the German people of the
<br>
time.  The 6 or 7 % of the population, who were directly exposed
<br>
to those atrocities mostly disappeared quietly over night and
<br>
faded from the memories of the general population.  99% of the
<br>
rest of us had absolutely no idea, what was happening to them
<br>
afterwards and the fraction of one percent, who were directly
<br>
involved in those atrocities, did well for themselves by not
<br>
talking about it, unless they wanted to share the fate of their
<br>
victims.
<br>
<p>*The rest of us (the then adults anyway) have experienced in the
<br>
years prior to Hitler s election in 1932: 60 to 70% unemployment,
<br>
galloping inflation, during which you started in the morning after
<br>
negotiating a wage, which would feed the family for a day, and in
<br>
the evening, when you got paid, it was barely enough to buy one
<br>
cigarette.  Tumults in the streets fist fights between Nazis and
<br>
Communists, the Weimar Republic out of control.  Then in just six
<br>
short years Germany rose from being the economically most
<br>
devastated industrialized country to the one with the highest
<br>
living standard with full employment.  That was the foundation
<br>
for the fanatic enthusiasm, with which the people supported the
<br>
Nazis, and why their believe in the final victory of Germany was
<br>
unwavering for so long.
<br>
<p><p>Albert Speer, Hitlers architect, is also credited with bringing
<br>
the German war production into high gear and condemned for using
<br>
slave labour to achieve that.  In 1942, when he took over and
<br>
when the bombing of industrial plants in the from Britain easy to
<br>
reach Rhein/Rhur areas by the Allies started in earnest, the monthly
<br>
production of tanks (the smallish P4) was under 100.  By 1944 it
<br>
had risen to 400 of the much bigger Koenigstiger, despite the
<br>
relentless bombing.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Olaf
