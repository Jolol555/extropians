Subject: Re: Addiction
<br>
<p>&quot;Alcoholism is not a genetic predisposition to addictive behavior,
<br>
it is a genetic predisposition to a substance. Once addicted to a
<br>
substance it is not easy to quit, but I agree it is essential.&quot;
<br>
<p>But, the primary question is, CAN a person DECIDE to quit, or do they have
<br>
no control over their actions?
<br>
<p>&quot;Both alcoholism and MS are genetic in basis. You cannot become an
<br>
alcoholic without the requisite genetics.&quot;
<br>
<p>So a person who enjoys drinking a lot of alcohol, even though he has no
<br>
genetic predisposition to 'alcoholism' is not an alcoholic?  I would guess
<br>
that Alcoholism, at the least, can be psychologically addictive as well
<br>
physically addictive.  I guess it depends on how you define alcoholism.
<br>
Which leads to my next question, how do you define alcoholism.
<br>
<p>A) Someone who uncontrollable drinks at the site of alcohol and can not
<br>
choose to stop drinking
<br>
B) Someone who drinks at the site of alcohol but can choose to stop drinking
<br>
C) someone who drinks a lot of alcohol
<br>
D) someone who has this particular genetic variation
<br>
<p>&quot;Some people cannot touch alcohol without getting ill, an alcoholic
<br>
can drink sufficient quantities to kill themselves without getting
<br>
ill.&quot;
<br>
<p>Can non-alcoholics also drink significant quantities that would kill other
<br>
non-alcoholics?  Or is that your definition of an alcoholic, someone who
<br>
*can* drink a lot of alcohol and not die?  (whatever that arbitrary amount
<br>
is)
<br>
<p>&quot;Alcoholism is not simply about behavior, and the biochemical
<br>
pathways first established in rat studies have been confirmed in
<br>
humans.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here we get back to what alcoholism is.  Is it 
<br>
<p>A)only about behavior 
<br>
B)only about genetics
<br>
C)about behavior AND genetics?
<br>
<p>I do not dispute that the physiological receptors that have to do with the
<br>
pleasure associated with alcohol are any different in rats then in humans,
<br>
but humans are not unconscious machines, like rats mostly are.  There are
<br>
more factors at play than mere genes, namely that humans have consciousness
<br>
and can CHOOSE their own paths (we are, after all, fighting 3 billion years
<br>
of evolutionary influenced behavior when we put on a condom).  Rats are not
<br>
known for such things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is also considerable evidence that if someone, no matter how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addicted to something, chooses to stop doing it, he (or she) can. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That evidence being the multitude of people who have stopped doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something they are addicted to doing by just deciding that they no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer want to do it.  We can, after all 'decide' to stop eating. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This is incorrect.&quot;
<br>
<p>What is incorrect, that we can decide to stop eating, or that we can decide
<br>
to stop doing things that we are addicted to?
<br>
<p>&quot;Any medical professional can tell you drug addicts (including
<br>
alcohol) can and do die going cold turkey.&quot;
<br>
<p>You also die from 'deciding' not to eat, the physical repercussions of your
<br>
actions are a red herring in this discussion, the point of contention (at
<br>
least, I thought) was the ability to choose your own actions.  Can an
<br>
alcoholic choose to stop drinking alcohol of his on free will?  Conversely,
<br>
can some unfortunate person afflicted with MS 'choose' to no longer be
<br>
afflicted with MS?
<br>
<p>&quot;The issue is considerably more complex&quot;
<br>
<p>that I agree to, the physiological mechanisms that contribute to addictions
<br>
and the sociological and behavioral conditions that contribute to addictions
<br>
are indeed very complex.  But at the heart of the matter, people choose to
<br>
do everything they do, and an alcoholic can choose to stop drinking (and
<br>
many have, unless you define alcoholic as someone who can not choose to stop
<br>
drinking) just as a heroin addict can choose to not use heroin or a
<br>
cigarette smoker can choose to not smoke anymore.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;IMHO that is...
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I'm dealing in facts, not opinions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sounded like a lot of opinions to me.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Alcoholism ...is a genetic predisposition to a substance&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;You cannot become an alcoholic without the requisite genetics&quot;
<br>
<p>But in either case, I only added the 'IMHO' to encourage a peacefull
<br>
exchange of ideas, and did not expect it to be used as a spring board for an
<br>
argumentum ad hominem.  
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael
