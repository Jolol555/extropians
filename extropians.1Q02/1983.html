</em><br>
<p>William Calvin would probably argue that it derives from the
<br>
interaction of two thought patterns overlapping one another
<br>
in the brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And to be sure, the weight of the evidence,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Be careful -- there is probably a selection effect in that &quot;Westerners&quot;
<br>
may have been higher levels of novelty-seeking genes.  We discussed
<br>
this on the list a couple of months ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But. If intelligence includes innovation, then innovation also would seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involve generating and testing &quot;patterns which connect.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The problem is -- do they &quot;connect&quot; from a common sense perspective
<br>
of being innovative or useful or are they simply &quot;interesting&quot;?
<br>
The connection of &quot;sad--cow&quot; generates an entirely different
<br>
pattern in my brain than the two patterns generated by &quot;mad--cow&quot;
<br>
which is different from the somewhat fuzzy &quot;cow--mad&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It ought, therefore, to be possible to construct an algorithm for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I'm on new ground here, at least not on the &quot;is it possible?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposition. Maybe a bit more so on the question of why we ain't done it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet.
</em><br>
<p>Its &quot;hard&quot; but we are getting closer.  See some of the discussion
<br>
(and refs) in my Nano@Home paper:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Proposals/NanoAtHome.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Proposals/NanoAtHome.html</a>
<br>
<p>As someone's sig says, &quot;everything is easy once you know how to do it&quot;.
<br>
It is questionable whether humans could ever properly wire together
<br>
100 million transistors -- but there are computers that can accomplish
<br>
that clever trick.  What one needs are the metrics and heuristics
<br>
that generate useful patterns and efficient means for recognizing
<br>
good combinations in specific knowledge domains.  We are slowly
<br>
(very slowly in most cases) managing to accomplish that.
