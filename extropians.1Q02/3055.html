<p><em>&gt;   The core funds should (IMHO) be placed in Swiss anuities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as this is a (effectively) a legal way to save funds and acrue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest on them, and not tell Uncle Sam about them without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaking the US tax code.
</em><br>
<p>Better be careful how you do this. The Swiss banking industry is now
<br>
co-operating with Uncle S more than they did in the past. I've read articles
<br>
about this and observed it personally.
<br>
<p>See, for example,...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Barbara,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously you're the expert in this area. I would point out,
<br>
and correct me if I'm wrong, that while one would have to be
<br>
scrupulous in reporting the contents of a foreign bank account
<br>
to the IRS, if one wished to be utterly &quot;legit&quot; this is not true
<br>
for life insurance.  This is why I suggested a Swiss annuity.
<br>
&nbsp;It is not reportable, and is only taxable upon withdrawal
<br>
(at one's normal income tax level for that year), it's safe from
<br>
things such as currency controls, bankruptcy, financial reversals,
<br>
judgements by litigatous vermin, deflation, hell even governmental
<br>
seizure for most purposes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swiss have obviously moved closer towards some cooperation
<br>
with American and EU authorities, these strictures primarily
<br>
apply to criminal activity (be it laudering the proceeds of
<br>
ill done deeds) or (of course) terrorism.  They also apply
<br>
primarily to investment or bank accounts, but not really
<br>
to life insurance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life insurance is covered by different rules than a standard
<br>
bank account. Much more difficult to attack.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also much less suspicous. How many criminals/terrorists
<br>
put their cash in life insurance???
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as one isn't making the odd donation to the Environmental
<br>
Liberation Front or Al-Quaeda, or paying the premiums on your
<br>
insurance with money you didn't report to the Feds...it seems
<br>
difficult to run into trouble.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not interested in playing chicken with the revenuers. :)
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
Brian
