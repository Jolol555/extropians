<p><p>That is much too fast an increase to occur in hardly more than a

these statistics are valid.  Also these semi-autistic nerds

aren't exactly in the happy of dropping huge broods of babies.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;      Twelve-fold? Is this an epidemic? Some have rashly thought this might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be because of some pollutant or even vaccine damage, but the evidence for 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; detection and awareness, thanks to the tireless work of autism charities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I can suggest one possible factor: much more electronic 
<br>
information consumed from a very young age and in relative 
<br>
isolation.  It is not at all impossible that such tends to grow 
<br>
the wiring of the young human brain a bit differently than more 
<br>
conventional social early-childhood pastimes.  If true, this may 
<br>
have good and bad consequences.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;      But could it also be that this has also been a result of the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid evolutionary change to the human brain that we have witnessed? A 
</em><br>
<p><p>No.  Evolution cannot account for that fast a change as I 
<br>
understand it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; recent issue of Wired Magazine in December 2001 reported that the rate of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autism was hitting record rates in Silicon Valley, where a new evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; niche was opening up for people to fly in from around the planet, sell their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical and systemising talent, and find reproductive success which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would otherwise have remained beyond reach. Our experimental research is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent with this interpretation, and warrants further testing. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, we don't drop a lot of babies.  Insufficient in any case 
<br>
to account for the numbers given.
