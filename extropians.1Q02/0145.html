<p>
In v6#364 &quot;Technotranscendance&quot; said: 
<br>
<p>&quot;One, I don't think tax money should be taken at all.  So, there can be no
<br>
moral justification for tax funded aid to Afghanistan.  I did not bomb
<br>
Afghanistan.  Nor did I voluntarily support said bombing.  In fact, I've
<br>
been against the war from the start -- and probably every military effort of
<br>
the US that has happened in my adult life -- e.g., the Persian Gulf War and
<br>
the wars in the Balkans.  (Those who did support the war are another matter.
<br>
I did not.)&quot;
<br>
<p>While I sympathise that you do not want your tax dollars going towards such
<br>
ventures (particularly military ventures) I feel your reasoning is flawed.
<br>
If taxpayers were able to decide exactly where their tax dollars would go
<br>
there would be chaos - people who don't drive cars would refuse to
<br>
contribute towards road maintenance, healthy people would refuse to
<br>
contribute towards public health, young people would refuse to contribute
<br>
towards care for the elderly, employed people would refuse to contribute
<br>
towards welfare of any kind (justified or not). Pacifists would refuse to
<br>
contribute towards any military (&amp; possibly any police) funding. I think you
<br>
can see where I am going with this...
<br>
<p>Taxation, the great bug bear of American citizenry, HAS it's uses. Tax
<br>
dollars can &amp; should be used to provide services that the community as a
<br>
whole needs otherwise these needs would not be met. I am the first to say
<br>
that current tax structures, both here in Australia &amp; in the US, do not do a
<br>
very good job of catering to those needs, &amp; much work in tax reform (&amp;
<br>
government spending) is needed. However the constant obsession with lowering
<br>
tax burdens (particularly for the wealthy, who through tax avoidance
<br>
schemes, contribute increasingly small portions of their incomes) is slowly
<br>
killing off vital public services such as education and healthcare without
<br>
trimming the often ridiculous excesses of state &amp; federal government.
