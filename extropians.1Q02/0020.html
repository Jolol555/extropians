<em>&gt; Your point 3 contradicts your point 1, because you /do/ in fact want the

<em>&gt; policeman to carry a gun, otherwise he will be unprepared to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibly dangerous and violent situation for which you called him. 
</em><br>
<p>(1) I don't want the policeman to carry a gun. I want him to clear the 
<br>
situation. I don't want someone shot dead, I want to drink my beer without 
<br>
being threatened.
<br>
<p>(2) I have explained in another mail why I consider a professional police 
<br>
officer here (I've also explained the differences in training and 
<br>
supervision) to be more competent than a wannabe hero with a gun.
<br>
<p>(3) Please look at the german crime statistics. German policemen use their 
<br>
gun very seldom:
<br>
<p>Use of firearms by the german police in 1997 (the newest data I found):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Self-defense or defense of others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29 uses against things (incl. animals like mad dogs)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37 uses against persons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) prevention of crimes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 uses against things
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 uses against persons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) prevention of flight of persons under suspicion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 uses against things
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 uses against person
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) prevention of flight of prisoners
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 use.
<br>
<p>(<a href="http://www.cilip.de/ausgabe/62/waffen.htm">http://www.cilip.de/ausgabe/62/waffen.htm</a>, sorry, only in german)
<br>
<p>Total: 106 uses, 60 against persons.
<br>
<p>In Bavaria, our most right-wing/&quot;law-and-order&quot; state, the secretary of the 
<br>
Interior, Günther Beckstein, said in 2001: &quot;Thanks to the extensive and 
<br>
de-escalative training of the Bavarian police, first all other coercives 
<br>
like the newly introduced pepper-spray are used, while the use of firearms 
<br>
is only the ultima ratio.&quot;[1]
<br>
<p>Is de-escalation a part of your concept of self-defense? Do the training 
<br>
courses for self-defense with firearms in the US emphasize de-escalation 
<br>
and consider the use of firearms only as ultima ratio? Or are we again at 
<br>
the point of no-alternatives like in the Afghanistan discussion?
<br>
<p>Germany has 80 mio. citizens. Our population density is 250 persons/sq km, 
<br>
compared to 27 p/sq km in the US and &gt;250 in New York. We have far less 
<br>
legal weapons here and according to official estimations far less illegal 
<br>
weapons than in the US. <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/gap.pdf">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/gap.pdf</a> is an 
<br>
interesting comparison between the legal systems, the prosecution and 
<br>
justice of the US and Germany.
<br>
<p>Once again my question: Can you explain why the crime rates and use of 
<br>
firearms here is so much lower than in the USA? If it isn't the tech and it 
<br>
isn't the weapons, what magic is it then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to have a typically European bias that somehow the policeman is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more qualified to &quot;play hero&quot; than other citizens, while the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition leans more toward self-reliance.
</em><br>
<p>The question of &quot;bias&quot; mostly is a question of whom you ask... IMO, the 
<br>
&quot;somehow&quot; can indeed be shown by comparing the education and training, but 
<br>
that's another thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Secondly, how do your feelings deal with the fact that technologies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the horizon that make a handgun seem like a child's toy?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;problem&quot; (if there is one) with firearms is no different from any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empowering technology: it empowers evil people to do more evil, and good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to do more good--but since we fear the former, we restrict the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology which ends up limiting the latter.  The extropian ideal is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create new and better technologies that empower the good guys more, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep ahead of the bad guys, and figure out what causes people to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad guys and deal with that.
</em><br>
<p>(1) What magic will take care, that the &quot;good guys&quot; (who defines &quot;good&quot;, 
<br>
btw?) will always be smarter and have the better tech?
<br>
<p>(2) I've tried to shift the topic onto a more sociological level and a more 
<br>
global perspective, i.e. &quot;figure out what causes people to become 'bad' 
<br>
guys&quot;, but this either ended in &quot;tech will solve everything&quot; (how? why?) or 
<br>
&quot;don't know, I quit&quot; (the easy escape) or &quot;but handguns are okay&quot; (no real 
<br>
argument, regardless of no. of repetitions)
<br>
<p>In fact, I feel the sheer horror when I think of, e.g. Mike Lorrey define 
<br>
what's &quot;good&quot; (from his point of view) and go around with a &quot;meme changing 
<br>
device&quot; to brain wash everyone. No thanks. I don't even want one nation to 
<br>
define what is &quot;good&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I have heard this argument before: &quot;The minorities&quot; are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violent and criminal than the rest. (I won't discuss prejudices of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; police and justice here) It is sad to say that the numbers seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; confirm this theory, in the US as well as here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike said nothing of the sort, and nothing even remotely resembling this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems clear to me that you didn't even try to read and understand what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he did say, and this reflects very poorly on the value of anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have to say.
</em><br>
<p>Nice but unsubstantial rhetoric. The argument of the &quot;more violent 
<br>
minorities&quot; came from another author, that's right, I'm sorry. But 
<br>
incompatible subcultures that lead to burning discos are not a sign of a 
<br>
peaceful society either.
<br>
<p>So, what can we do to come to a peaceful society, not only in the US, but 
<br>
in the world? If you ask me, it can not be the &quot;&lt;insert your favorite&gt; 
<br>
culture for everyone&quot;, but only a balance of many.
