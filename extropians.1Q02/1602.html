<em>&gt;&gt;I think the point of improvement for U.S. health care is to take

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;regularly and as the old adage goes &quot;an ounce of prevention is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;How could it be structured to make this happen? I guess insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies would be interested in this too, if it could reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future costs. 
</em><br>
<p>This is supposed to be the original intent of HMO's (Health
<br>
Maintenance Organizations) here in the U.S. but they've largely
<br>
devolved into just plain poor health care providers.
<br>
<p>I had read somewhere that in China, doctors are paid when people
<br>
are well, and then when they are sick the doctors have to treat
<br>
them for free. Probably urban myth but an interesting possibility.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I also consider it important that we get away from the old model
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where the patient is a client and essentially put in a subservient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;position, to a model where the patient is a customer, going to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doctor to buy health-related personal information or services.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Part of this is happening with internet-enabled people who look up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their illnessed before going to the doctor, seeing themselves more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as part of the team than just an object to be cured, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this process could be improved further. In fact, if health
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information and health services could be more efficiently spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through the net, we would get a noticeable increase in prevention.
</em><br>
<p>We're starting to see a lot of competitiveness amongst health care
<br>
providers here in the U.S. at least in urban areas. You'll see
<br>
hospitals build little emergency care centers in each others
<br>
territories.
<br>
<p>Getting insurance carriers involved is something else. I'm
<br>
considering getting LASIK surgery done and am trying to convince my
<br>
carrier to pick up part/all the cost as part of my prescription eye
<br>
benefits.
<br>
<p>I agree that net based health care information is the future.
