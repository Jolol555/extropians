<br>
Well, in many ways Eudoxa is my own organisation (although Waldemar and
<br>
the others deserve around 75% of the credit) and is in many ways what I
<br>
hope transhumanism would move towards: a think tank with an organised
<br>
economy, integrating itself into the mainstream, that develops and
<br>
spreads a transhumanist ideology (in our case for profit, too). As I
<br>
said at TransVision: transhumanism in suits and ties works!
<br>
<p>But I would hardly call myself an eudoxian, rather a liberal (european
<br>
sense). In fact, we are very careful of not mentioning the word
<br>
&quot;transhumanist&quot; in the debate. 
<br>

<p>Ouch! :-) 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I know you could do much better at coining a term...
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Everybody who thinks as I do&quot;-ians? :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, I was very disturbed to see you considering a backing away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the term transhumanist.  Is the Extropy Institute the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bastion of transhumanist integrity?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Yes, I have spent so much time talking and thinking about transhumanism
<br>
that it feels painful to even consider backing away from the term. I
<br>
have not changed my views on human freedom and development, but I think
<br>
I must find better ways of promoting them. And honestly, the word
<br>
&quot;transhumanism&quot; is starting to become a liability in many respects. 
<br>
<p>As for ExI, the problem is that as long as the definition of
<br>
transhumanism is up in the air, it is impossible to have integrity about
<br>
it. I think the extropian principles are great and I agree with them,
<br>
and I think ExI has been (and is!) doing much good. But it is not
<br>
enough, we need to really start talking to the mainstream and show that
<br>
transhumanism stands for something both workable, desirable and ethical.
<br>
Efforts have already been done, but we need far more. This is why we
<br>
need more transhumanist think tanks, transhumanist companies and so on.
