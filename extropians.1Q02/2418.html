Subject: Re: CLIMATE: Cooling, not warming...
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Variations in the Milankovich cycles can, in fact, also explain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooling and warming trend that has stretched from the middle ages to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present. The peak of the 'little ice age' was around 1300 or so, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Norse colonies in Greenland were wiped out, and things have warmed a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since then, not just in the past century, entirely in keeping with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Milankovitch's predictions.
</em><br>
<p>One slight correction, the worst period for the &quot;little ice age&quot; is the mid
<br>
to late 17th century. (That's why we're constantly being told that recent
<br>
years are the hottest &quot;since records began&quot; because official climatological
<br>
records were first kept then, at the peak of a cold period). The cooling
<br>
starts in the late thirteenth and gets bad after 1300. Otherwise, exactly
<br>
right. The world was as warm as it is now in the 12th/11th centuries when,
<br>
as we all know, the streets of Paris were choked with motor vehicles and
<br>
Constantinople had to bring in a clean air law. The evidence for historical
<br>
periods goes back further than this and the 4th/5th centuries were probably
<br>
warmer than today. All this suggests that while the earth may be warming up
<br>
we should be very sceptical of arguments that it's down to human activity.
<br>
In any event, it's not clear to me the current warming trend is a &quot;bad
<br>
thing&quot;. Bad news if you're a Dutchman or live in Central America, great news
<br>
if you're a Canadian. Steve Davies
