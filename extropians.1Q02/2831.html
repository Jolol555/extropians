<p><em>&gt; I have felt for some time that cryonics was a lead weight dragging down

</em><br>
<p>It is not that simple, but for all practical purposes you can consider
<br>
cryonics to be cursed, and everything it touches tainted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A couple of years ago, Foresight essentially declared victory in the war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for acceptance of nanotechnology.  There were conferences held every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year, one or more respected journals, government funding was ramping up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; articles in business journals.  By all accounts it was now an accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future technology.
</em><br>
<p>Nanotechnology, not molecular manufacturing. &quot;Nanotechnology&quot; has suffered
<br>
namespace DoS by dilution/overuse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But maybe that was premature.  We are seeing a backlash, a rearguard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting action against the original vision of nanotech.  Opponents are
</em><br>
<p>I'm not seeing this at all. In fact in the passed years opposition to
<br>
drextech was considerably tougher, and those voices get progressively
<br>
extinguished as our capababilities in characterisation and petty
<br>
fabrication (one grad-student-afternoon) of nanodevices have been ramping
<br>
up. Future never looked brighter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; trying to build a firewall against Drexlerian mechanosynthesis, drawing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a distinction between their prosaic nanotech and Drexler's far-out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visions. They prefer to focus on biotech, on nanoparticles, on MEMS, on
</em><br>
<p>The worse for the fools. That way they won't even get to bask in reflected
<br>
credit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; bulk materials engineering at the nanoscale.  All these things can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done today, in fact they are the natural consequence of existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies just extending their capabilities a bit.  They want to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding for their current research.  In this environment there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to even think about blue sky dreams like eternal perfect health,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or nightmares like engineered malignant replicators.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this has been going on for many years now. Funding is a lot like a
<br>
scam, based on participating in fabricating consensual realities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think Foresight needs to go back to its roots and shore up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundations.  It's not enough to have &quot;nanotechnology&quot; initiatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing up everywhere.  Few of those efforts are making significant
</em><br>
<p>Right. We need molecular manufacturing initiatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; progress towards Drexler's machine-based models.  Foresight needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remind people that there is more to nanotech than making ultra-fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powders for smoother paint.  We have to keep our eye on the prize, a
</em><br>
<p>Not all of them are evil, you know. Some of the nanoclusters could be
<br>
useful for precursors of molecular devices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; technology which can utterly revolutionize every aspect of the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If research is not moving us towards that goal, it should not receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding under nanotech grants, even if it happens to involve little tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces.
</em><br>
<p>Foresight now deals in two-digit megabuck grants? Wow. Nobody told me.
