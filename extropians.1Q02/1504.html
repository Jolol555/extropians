Subject: RE: a health dilemma
<br>
<p>&quot;I'd like to correct some misconceptions here.
<br>
<p>MS is an autoimmune disease, it is caused by a genetic aberation
<br>
that causes the immune system to overreact to an innocuous
<br>
substance.
<br>
<p>Contrary to popular misconception you do not become an alcoholic
<br>
simply by drinking alcohol even though it is an addictive
<br>
substance, you are born an alcoholic. Alcoholism is a disease with
<br>
a genetic basis. &quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------------
<br>
<p>Do the genes that create a propensity for alchoholism also enable your
<br>
brain, subconcioussly of course, to A) recognize an alchoholic beverage
<br>
B)reach a hand out and grasp it C) bring it toward your mouth D)swallow it?
<br>
Or, at some point in time, are you concioussly aware of these things going
<br>
on.  Even being an alchoholic, even being born with the genetic
<br>
predisposition to alchoholism (which is more a genetic predisposition to
<br>
addictive behavior) you can still CHOOSE to not drink, its as simple as
<br>
that.  Can a person with MS CHOOSE not to have MS?  I dont think so.  
<br>
<p>&quot;We have alcoholic rats, they prefer alcohol to anything else, and
<br>
we have teetotaler rats, who won't touch the stuff. Guess what
<br>
happens if you extract a specific enzyme from the alcoholic rats
<br>
and inject it into the teetotaler rats? That's correct, the former
<br>
teetotaler rats become instant alcoholics.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thats great, fascinating and interesting, and would apply if we were rats.
<br>
But we are not, we are people, people who are aware of thier actions and
<br>
thier choices, people who have free will.  Rats, when in stressed confined
<br>
situations can resort to cannibalism.  Does that mean people will too?
<br>
Primates exhibit what is known as the 'Elevator effect' when in stressed
<br>
confined conditions.  They are all calm and polite to one another, which,
<br>
surprisingly enough, is how human's behave as well.  Just cause a Rat does
<br>
something, does not mean a person will.  
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;Now someone with the proclivity to tolerate alcohol can develop a
<br>
dependance on the substance, in fact only people with a specific
<br>
genetic proclivity can. If someone with this proclivity does
<br>
develop a dependance then they have to make a conscious moral
<br>
decision to stop. There is considerable evidence that once a
<br>
dependance developes the individual remains sensitive to further
<br>
dependancy. I suspect a physiological change.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------
<br>
<p>There is also considerable evidence that if someone, no matter how addicted
<br>
to something, chooses to stop doing it, he (or she) can.  That evidence
<br>
being the multitude of people who have stopped doing something they are
<br>
addicted to doing by just deciding that they no longer want to do it.  We
<br>
can, after all 'decide' to stop eating.  
<br>
<p>IMHO that is...
<br>
