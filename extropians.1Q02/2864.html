<em>&gt; AMEN.  And again, there are many users of many different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substance who are in no way &quot;addicts&quot;, so using this language is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negatively polarizing of issues of human freedom.  Hell, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have everything you own seized by forfeiture laws if one joint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is found on the premises.  I defy anyone to tell me how that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes any sense or how someone occassionally smoking pot (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firing up at the end of the workday for that matter) can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equated with being a junkie.
</em><br>
<p>I have repeatedly said that a) I distinguish between users and addicts,
<br>
and b) I don't think that forfeiture laws are particularly well written
<br>
or executed to perform the job they are intended to do. So please don't
<br>
assume that I think otherwise. Nor do I think the way forfeiture is
<br>
practiced reflects very well with the way I've described it SHOULD work.
<br>
<p>However, there is a very salient point to be made about indirect
<br>
consequences. I am reminded of the latest anti-drug public service ads
<br>
on tv these days, illustrating that drug profits are the largest source
<br>
of income for terrorist organizations. Whether you are dealing with left
<br>
or right wing terrorists in Columbia as well as the rest of latin
<br>
america, or with heroin profits funding al Qaeda and other islamist
<br>
groups, the money a drug user spends funds the violence directed at
<br>
innocent people.
<br>
<p>Now, it's obvious that legalization would likely mitigate a good share
<br>
of this funneling, if only by the effects of reduced prices and taxation
<br>
of profits.
<br>
<p>Be that as it may, given the current state of affairs in the world, the
<br>
best thing a drug user could do today to do their patriotic share is to
<br>
cut back or quit for the duration, to help deny these funds to the
<br>
enemy. If demand drops, prices and profits will too, and terrorist
<br>
groups will have to find other ways to fund their activities.
