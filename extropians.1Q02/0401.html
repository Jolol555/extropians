<p>Hey, I've been on the list for nearly a decade.  Well, 8.5 years.
<br>
<p>But... I was never 100% behind the anarchist program -- I'd argue for it
<br>
with more statist friends, then come here and play arch-conservative or
<br>
toy with quasi-socialist ideas as an exercise.  But ignore the
<br>
socialism.  These days anarchy and even minarchy seem naive.  
<br>
<p>Societal survival can be treated as a problem in information processing
<br>
-- find threats, come up with responses, mobilizes resources to
<br>
implement responses.  Government can act as the central nervous system
<br>
of society, compelling the cells -- excuse me, individuals -- to act in
<br>
concert in situations where ungoverned motivations would result in
<br>
behavior unconducive to survival.  Of course, not all the interactions
<br>
of the cells/individuals can be centrally monitored.  Quite a lot
<br>
happens from individual interactions, governed by shared nature (cloned
<br>
genes/common human nature or culture) and enforcement activty around
<br>
problems (meet Officer Lymphocyte).  But not everything can happen
<br>
efficiently that way.
<br>
<p>Of course, many governments are not pro-survival information processing
<br>
systems for their societies, as opposed to benefitting the brain
<br>
cells/rulers in charge.  Possibly most haven't been.  But just because
<br>
there are more ways to have a badly wired brain than a usefully wired
<br>
one doesn't mean having a brain is a bad thing; it means get a better
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>The USA has many flaws, both from the POV of the individual and the
<br>
society.  &quot;But utopia isn't an option.&quot;  The USA (and other Western
<br>
countries) does a lot of things which you _would_ expect a pro-survival
<br>
information processing entity to do.  It finances research, gathering
<br>
information about the environment and its internal affairs.  (&quot;Hey,
<br>
there's this ozone layer,  And it's going away.  Wait, that's bad.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Hey, there's the asteroid moseying nearby.&quot;  &quot;Hey, our children can't
<br>
read.&quot;)  Then democracy lets everyone try to call attention to their
<br>
problems (&quot;We're going to fry!&quot; &quot;We're going to die!&quot; &quot;Johnny can't
<br>
read!&quot; &quot;Johnny can't pray!&quot;) and there's a decision process for what to
<br>
do (&quot;Let's not fry.  Asteroid?  Silly freaks, go away.  Let's hire more
<br>
teachers.  And you, go away.&quot;)  With free speech to allow full flow of
<br>
information and drawing attention to mistakes.
<br>
<p>And the whole democracy thing allows kicking out execssively dumb
<br>
rulers.
<br>
<p>Vs. typical autocracy, with little investment in finding problems, and
<br>
suppression of people criticizing the Supreme Leader's tender ego, and
<br>
addressing problems by whim of said Leader, and no way to stuff the
<br>
Leader up the butt of the white elephant he decided to buy rather than
<br>
try to catch up with the British gunships forcing opium up the river[1].
<br>
That's a bad info processing system.
<br>
<p>But an anarchy can't necessarily respond to invasion or selfish people
<br>
destroying the ozone layer with CFCs either.
<br>

<p>[1] Yes, the example mixes Asian countries shamelessly.
