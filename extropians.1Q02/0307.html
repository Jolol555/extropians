<em>&gt; &gt; From my readings online, there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very little that discusses what happens in between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a) useful primer steps like Cyg [Cyc?], Flare, etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) boom! functioning, if very crude general intelligence or seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which I would assume is because no-one really knows for sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or else we'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be hip deep in AIs by now).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say that a &quot;functioning, but very crude GI&quot; *is* an intermediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step, if by &quot;functioning but very crude&quot; you mean &quot;the modules are talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to each other but the overall system doesn't do anything interesting&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's up for debate as to what either of us means by &quot;crude&quot;. Let's say
<br>
whatever can be achieved in 2 years by a standard sized tech team for a new
<br>
company.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To get an &quot;intermediate application&quot; before this point requires that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try and implement something less than a GI.  And to do this, you are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have to do different work in different ways than you would if you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking a direct path to general intelligence.  You are going to have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expend a lot of effort on building a functioning system only some of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be useful as a way station to GI.  I would be afraid of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bogged down in something that wasn't directly on the road to GI - but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, SIAI is a nonprofit and thus has different strategic requirements;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can try for seed AI and accept intermediate applications whenever they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show up, rather than having to convince VCs about the shortsightedness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive shortcuts.  Peter Voss or Ben Goertzel may have different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals and consequently different plans.
</em><br>
<p>I was wondering if there were any waypoints in the process that produce
<br>
viable products without the &quot;destructive shortcuts&quot;. Of course if a sideline
<br>
leads to the revenue needed to stay afloat, then it wasn't all that
<br>
destructive. But yes, different organizations, different goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have to say, though, that one of the largest reasons - maybe even *the*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest reasons - why SIAI is a nonprofit is that general intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed AI is pretty much one of the most complicated things in the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if there's a VC with voting control sitting there and saying &quot;Make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this simpler so it can go out the door in six months&quot;, then AI is just not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to happen there.
</em><br>
<p>It's not so much a matter of getting the final product out of the door in
<br>
six months -- it's having *a* product out of the door in six months. And
<br>
that can cover a wide variety of sins.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now if you're walking into a VC's office to pitch an AI company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the few places you're guaranteed not to be the strangest project they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen -- they're going to want to hear how you're going to be generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revenue within six months from an initial investment. [Since you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; software company, that is, and producing those easy-to-make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as opposed to an infrastructure company making those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard-to-make lumps of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iron, but I digress -- lambasting VCs is far too easy].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Six months?  A dream.
</em><br>
<p>Why? It takes four months, five developers and a quarter of a million
<br>
dollars to produce software that retails for half a million, including
<br>
support. In most cases, this is the compromise version -- the full (and much
<br>
more complex) vision isn't realized until a few years of new versions down
<br>
the line. So the argument would be, if someone can dedicate resources to do
<br>
that for another field, what is it about AI development that means you can't
<br>
produce something that can be sold in the same timeframe?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So you're starting out with something along the lines of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some useful protocode for classifying information and information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processing, possibly even a grasp of the One True Path To AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; produce in six months that you can sell? What is the improvement on that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that would be coming out in a year?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In six months, you can produce a toy program that is totally off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development path to general AI.  I think that's pretty much it.
</em><br>
<p>With a broader view of the term &quot;product,&quot; alternatively, you could produce,
<br>
say:
<br>
<p>a) knowledgable consultants to farm out to other AI ventures
<br>
b) a single useful component that can be licensed to other AI ventures
<br>
c) a book on AI development
<br>
d) the material and contacts for a subscription-based newsletter for
<br>
development companies
<br>
<p>And so forth. Not that I'm convince there's a vast market of AI ventures out
<br>
there, but I don't think that there's anything wrong with taking those
<br>
directions.
