<p>Plenty of envy here, I'm not proud. :)
<br>
<p>But envy doesn't constitute an argument, nor a moral basis for changing the
<br>
way things are. Not by itself.
<br>
<p>I gather that the best current explanation (which of course serves the
<br>
interests of the obscenely rich, and so is as suspect as proclamations by
<br>
the tobacco industry of the healthy effects of smoking) is that it's a side
<br>
consequence of the market system we all love for its unparalleled success:
<br>
a side effect due to the kind of power law that kicks in with all such
<br>
systems `on the edge of chaos', as they used to say at Santa Fe. 
<br>
<p>A power law, of course, describes systems like avalanches and word usage
<br>
frequency, where some few words are used very, very often or some enormous
<br>
avalanches happen very, very rarely, and other instances following a power
<br>
curve up or down the scale (see Per Bak's HOW NATURE WORKS). If this is
<br>
validly applied to economics, then any market system will generate,
<br>
willy-nilly, a few owners tottering on billions (however unstably), say ten
<br>
times as many with hundreds of millions, 100 times as many with tens of
<br>
millions, 1000 times as many with millions, and lots and lots of us schmucks.
<br>
<p>Now plainly people can *decide* to stop it happening that way, by
<br>
confiscation or voluntary potlatch or inventing new disjunctive technology,
<br>
but the argument is that doing so (except for the last case) yields a less
<br>
than optimal--even catastrophically munged--outcome. Might be so. Certainly
<br>
there *are* plenty of these power law phenomena in human affairs, as there
<br>
are in nature at large.
