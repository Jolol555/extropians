<em>&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20We're%20stuck%20with%20each%20other">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Subject: We're stuck with each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In any case, I see this group of people as family. We are all far-flung
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cousins that cannot simply be ignored. Even if we disagree on some points,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we will have to learn to get along. It's a small universe and we're going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to keep running into each other. It is almost as if we are stranded in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;small subculture that forever ties us together as different from anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that preceded us or that might follow. We will be a small band of travelers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into the future. Even if the future is full of transhumans, our particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group will be comparatively small.
</em><br>
<p>Damn straight.
<br>
<p>If we are seriously intending on embarking on this journey (which I don't 
<br>
doubt from my time here), the more we do it together (or at very least, 
<br>
together in times of need) the better.  I don't think I've heard anyone 
<br>
here ever use the term &quot;family&quot; (stand to be corrected) but I'm certainly 
<br>
glad someone has.  I guess a family is a kind of &quot;subculture&quot; in some 
<br>
ways.  It's important to remember this, especially given the tough times 
<br>
here over the last few months.  It is my impression that we came close to 
<br>
losing people here who make this place what it is.  Parts of the furniture, 
<br>
so to speak.  I don't know about anyone else, but that would feel awfully 
<br>
crappy to me.
<br>
<p>I expect to meet most if not all of the people here at some time in the 
<br>
future ( brace yourselves ), either by chance or at one of these 
<br>
conferences I swear I'll eventually get to attend.  I look forward to that 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>I've implied it before but I'll state it here clearly;  I don't care what 
<br>
beef anyone here has had with me on this list, whether they've insulted me 
<br>
or I them (and I have to be sure), whether you tolerate me or despise 
<br>
me.  If you're ever in my neck of the woods, feel free to look me up.  If 
<br>
you're ever in my neck of the woods and you are in need assistance, call on me.
<br>
<p>I've no idea what most of you look like, where you live or how you live, 
<br>
but you've got a friend here if you happen to be in need of it.
<br>
<p>Oh, and make mine a cappuccino, Harvey.  Extra sprinkles......
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
