<em>&gt; However, I *have*
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of less committed views. These (like mine) may frequently sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian, but are more pragmatic and more interested in results than in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clinging to any particular ideology for the sake of &quot;consistency&quot; or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I would have to echo that sentiment.  I don't care about ideological purity
<br>
as much as I care about good long-term results.  I tend to default to
<br>
libertarian principles lacking a clearly better alternative, as there is
<br>
good reason to believe that it is the least damaging alternative lacking
<br>
specific information that would allow one to select an obvious &quot;best&quot;
<br>
solution.
<br>
<p>I tentatively feel these days that we (in a universal extropians list sense)
<br>
have a sufficiently good grasp of the social, political, and economic
<br>
dynamics that we could come up with a good approximation of the best
<br>
solution to just about any problem, given a working definition of &quot;best
<br>
solution&quot; (a difficult task in itself).  Even though I have anarchist
<br>
tendencies when I'm cranky, I would be happy with just about any form of
<br>
government that managed to keep the real tax rate of everyone below 5% (with
<br>
such a low tax rate, the types of government possible are largely restricted
<br>
to &quot;friendly&quot; types anyway).  There are certain costs associated with a
<br>
proper anarchy that probably exceed the cost of having minimal central
<br>
government, so while proper anarchy sounds fine in theory, I have my doubts
<br>
with respect to it being the most efficient structure.
<br>
<p>That's enough late night rambling in a medication induced haze.  My
<br>
apologies if it is incoherent. :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
