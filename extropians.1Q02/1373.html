From: &quot;John Clark&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Jaron%20Lanier%20Got%20Up%20My%20Shnoz%20on%20AI">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; There is no contradiction in confirming sentience via interacting with
</em><br>
others.
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; The operative word is *interacting* -- the level of intelligence is
</em><br>
secondary.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, intelligence is not important, you can interact with a rock, thus rocks
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; sentient.
</em><br>
<p>Now you're being obstinate. I didn't say intelligence is &quot;not important.&quot; I
<br>
said it's secondary to sentience in the exercise of confirming one's own
<br>
sentience. To make the point more clear: Interactive sentience confirms one's
<br>
own sentience, so that one doesn't need to &quot;guess&quot; that one is sentient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know for a fact that when I'm not conscious I'm not intelligent either
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you only &quot;know&quot; that when you're awake. Obviously, when you're not
<br>
awake, you can't know anything. &quot;Consciousness&quot; literally means &quot;with
<br>
knowledge&quot; and is a useless and redundant term that obscures the facts of
<br>
cognitive science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it seems reasonable that things that I can not interact INTELLIGENTLY with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like rocks, are not conscious,
</em><br>
<p>Nothing needs to be thought of as &quot;conscious.&quot; It's a useless hypothesis and
<br>
serves no valid scientific purpose whatever (except as an example that
<br>
parallels vitalism and phlogiston). Things such as rocks are not alive, and
<br>
not intelligent, so obviously you can't interact intelligently with them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so I ask again, what is it about this that made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you &quot;laugh out loud&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>It was the insistence that intelligence somehow proves the existence of the
<br>
useless hypothesis called &quot;consciousness.&quot; But, it doesn't. Intelligence and
<br>
sentience are discrete, but closely allied processes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can only figure you know I'm wrong because you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very intelligent when you're asleep or because you talk to conscious rocks.
</em><br>
<p>Don't be silly. This is an example of absurdity unworthy of you, John.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; That's easy: They both failed to claim that they are sentient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never claimed to be sentient, do you think I am?
</em><br>
<p>You think that calling yourself by a human name, viz., &quot;John Clark&quot; doesn't
<br>
imply that you are sentient? I think it does. If you were to call yourself
<br>
&quot;John The Computational Automaton&quot; then perhaps your denial that you claim to
<br>
be sentient could be taken seriously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a matter of fact I am not.
</em><br>
<p>You're stretching the argument to the point of ridiculousness, John.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
