<p>
Bless my ears and whiskers, my ignorance is a never-ceasing source of
<br>
appalled amazement. I'm reading a quite charming book, THE COMMON THREAD,
<br>
about the sequencing of the human genome, by Sir John Sulston (with pop sci
<br>
Georgina Ferry). Dr Sulston led the publicly funded British end of the HGP
<br>
until 2000, and I'm looking forward to learning the dirt on Francis Collins
<br>
vs Craig Venter and all. However, before I can get to that, I'm forced to
<br>
plough through a tutorial on how what DNA is and how it works--
<br>
<p>And I find that I don't even know where genes are stored.
<br>
<p>I'd thought they sat all jumbled up, protein-coding exon chunks jammed in
<br>
between the raving lunacy of 98+% of intron viral rubbish plus useful
<br>
non-coding control sequences, on what one might regard as the working
<br>
strand. Its complementary strand idled in neutral, waiting as a redundant
<br>
mirror image useful for proofreading purposes and corrections of chance
<br>
errors in the data strand. No. *Both* strands contain genes, running in
<br>
opposite directions. Did you know that? Am I the only idiot in the room?
<br>
<p>`Some genes are on one strand of DNA and some on the other, read in
<br>
opposite directions... Some small genes on one strand can actually sit
<br>
inside the introns [the `junk' or non-coding regions] of the other.' (p. 40)
<br>
<p>Of course we all knew about reading frames and how they can overlap in some
<br>
cases *on the same strand*. But this is entirely fresh to me.
<br>
