<p>I keep making the case that the nonlocal access memory bandwith and

latency is the first bottleneck, and the immultability of the numerical

one would estimate), but it's still hardwired. And we don't know how good

<p><em>&gt; software. If you don't get (b) the SI hits a ceiling that can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breached without humans supplying it with more advanced hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That presupposes that we would have the technology base at that time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to manufacture such hardware.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any significant kinetic bareers of growth. An SI will, of
<br>
course, be very adept at manipulating matter, and people (useful idiot
<br>
savant AI is not SI, and is arguably even harder to make). Many
<br>
semiconductor factories today are highly automated, because people are a
<br>
source of process pollution. We have pretty decent telepresence robots
<br>
already. And this is merely macroscale, as soon as the system starts
<br>
controlling nanoscale (arguably, hardware necessary for AI will require
<br>
molecular circuitry, so there's your foot in the door already) the
<br>
kinetics becomes very, very impressive. (Assuming, there are still people
<br>
left to be impressed).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So there could be a number of bumps in the road.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only smooth path I could envision for the singularity would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be an underground breakout that takes advantage of the WWW.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You would have to be able to co-opt a significant amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of underutilized resources to be able to manage an exponential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth path.  Ultimately you still face the requirement for

<br>
considerable investment into ultrabroadband user inteconnect and the

hardware will make a few advances still, there's considerable substrate

present.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; matter compilers.  I don't think this will be feasible until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have many high-bandwidth connections to a large fraction
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Well, we're talking about &gt;&gt;2010, or so. Still a decade or more to go. 10
<br>
GBit Ethernet is not very fast (what's the bandwidth of your optical
<br>
nerve, after the 1:126 retinal compression?), but of course it depends on
<br>
how much crunch your atomic blocks have, and which coding they use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If humans realize what is going on and decide they don't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to happen you run the risk that they will disconnect their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers from the net.  So you have the additional handicap

<p>User detection is trivial. First, at night most users are asleep. An
<br>
active user generates a stream of events. A low priority program on a
<br>
decent OS is effectively user-invisible. Folding@home I'm running is
<br>
invisible even on NT machines. Btw, while we're doing good progress

Extropy.org could use a few more processors. If you think PFP is lame, you

<p>more to your liking.

<p><em>&gt; This certainly is true.  By 2010-2015, when human mind equivalent
</em><br>

<p>Robert, you're waaay too optimistic here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It gives you pause -- 1 billion muslims around the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% of them devoting their computers to a DC project to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolve not a &quot;Friendly AI&quot; but an AI dedicated to advancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a radical muslim hegemony.
</em><br>
<p>The only hegemony an expansive AI can enforce is autohegemony.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That, IMO, is one of the problems with pushing AI technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike the situation with most humans, there may be no &quot;built-in&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human empathic perspectives in AIs.  I'm deeply suspicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any arguments that only beneficent AIs may produced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If malevolent AIs are as easy as friendly AIs then we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have some serious problems.
</em><br>
<p>A selfish AI is malevolent by side effect. All AIs created by evolutionary
<br>
methods are selfish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, certainly not.  But I think getting a smooth fit to the curve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to require either a late start (lots of underutilized resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available) or robust technologies that allow compiling matter as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I'd say 2016 is a better date than 2006.
</em><br>
<p>I could as well roll a dice.
