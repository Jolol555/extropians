<em>&gt;  &gt; To each their own but I thought it was one of the best movies of the year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  several years in fact. Of course if somebody wrote a fictional story about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a young man doing brilliant work in mathematics then developing severe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  schizophrenia and then becoming a campus joke as he wandered around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Princeton for 35 years making wild gestures and talking to himself and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  getting better and then winning the Nobel Prize, I'd say it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;pap too; however
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in this case it really happened. Truth really is stranger than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;fiction. Best acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I've ever seen too.
</em><br>

<p>I am sorry, but I agree with the others who disliked the film. Why 
<br>
does Hollywood have to sanitize people's lives? Nash has lived a 
<br>
brilliant and gritty life. I really do object to Ron Howard deciding 
<br>
to remove his bisexuality, his illegitimate child, his violent 
<br>
outbursts, his wife divorcing him... And where was the science?
<br>
<p>What right has Hollywood to dramatically re-write a Nobel Prize 
<br>
winner's life so that it appeals better to those in the midwest? 
<br>
Scientists are not like the pale character that was portrayed in this 
<br>
film. We eat, shit and fuck. The subject of the story is a genius 
<br>
bisexual mathematician who had schizophrenia and made huge 
<br>
contributions to economics and other disciplines. Why take out all 
<br>
the pepper and grit? The guy wasn't bambi. But Nash (not the 
<br>
character portrayed in the film) had an interesting life and it was 
<br>
worth telling.
<br>
<p>ciao, p.
