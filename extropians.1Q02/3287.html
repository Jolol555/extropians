<p>Well, I've thought for a while that having alzheimers just eliminates
<br>
the personality that inhabited that brain, but now I'm not so sure. Even
<br>
after having a stroke this weekend, and being a bed ridden immobile
<br>
mumbler for several years now, when his long (15 years) estranged son
<br>
who lives in CA finally called him this morning at 9, he apparently
<br>
understood enough that he died two hours later.
<br>
Sunday, my cousin visited him and played some of his old 78 records for
<br>
him. The Benny Goodman record apparently had an impact, as he started
<br>
jerking his shoulders to the music and was popping his mouth with the
<br>
drum solo.

</em><br>
<p>her family is from the Modena area of Italy, and are all long lifers.

</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't get sick at the sight of blood, so I'll probably do
<br>
something like call Alcor then cut my wrists or something when the time
<br>
comes. What would be nice is to have a do-it-yourself infusion kit to
<br>
replace your blood with a cryoprotectant while the cryoteam is on its
<br>
way. When they show up, you are all packed and lubed...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Writing online will still be a big part of my life extension plan, since
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (end)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It sounds to me like you have a medical excuse to write as many posts to the extrolist as you want! ; )
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that this will cut it with Max or Shaun.... ;)
