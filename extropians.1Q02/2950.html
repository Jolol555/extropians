The list has previously discussed the possibility that we
<br>
may get to the point where medical technology may be extending
<br>
the average lifespan at a rate of greater than one year per year.
<br>
This is in contrast to the ~0.25 year/year of the last century
<br>
in developed countries.
<br>
<p>The exowomb article had a pointer at the end to this article:
<br>
<p>Discovery of 'Methuselah gene' unlocks secret of long life 
<br>
<a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,644020,00.html">http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,644020,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>which I'm surprised people didn't pick up on given that its over
<br>
a week old.  Now, IMO, it is quite likely that the Decode discovery
<br>
is the gene on chromosome 4, previously reported by Tom Perl's group.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/18/10505">http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/18/10505</a>
<br>
<p>(For those who are unaware of it, Aeiveos Sciences Group initiated
<br>
the first genotyping studies of the oldest-old that Tom works with.)
<br>
<p>I'd be very surprised if the specific gene isn't pulled out within
<br>
the next year.
<br>
<p>Now, given the genetic technologies I expect will develop within
<br>
this decade, there is a reasonable chance that we will be able
<br>
to give everyone the benefits of the Methuselah gene.  If so
<br>
we will be bumping average longevity from ~75 to ~90 within
<br>
this decade, or ~15 years / decade.
<br>
<p>If that proves to be the case, then the expected longevity of
<br>
everyone on the list under the age of ~65 just became *much*
<br>
greater!
<br>
<p>Now, the &quot;harsh&quot; reality of this brings up an interesting question.
<br>
I've always thought that there should be a fundamental shift
<br>
in personal economic planning that takes place when people begin
<br>
to realize they are likely to live hundreds of years.  I call
<br>
this &quot;The no-brainer strategy to becoming wealthy&quot;.  It requires
<br>
taking $100-$1000 and depositing it in a savings account or
<br>
mutual fund and never withdrawing any funds from the account
<br>
until the annual increase in the account value exceeds what
<br>
one reasonably needs to live in the world.  It is based on
<br>
the idea that it doesn't require sophisticated investment
<br>
strategies to become wealthy, it simply requires living long
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>It would seem that Extropians/Transhumanists should be the first
<br>
to recognize the paradigm shift and adopt this strategy.  But
<br>
I don't see any evidence that any of these individuals that I
<br>
know have done so.  So the &quot;interesting question&quot; is &quot;Why
<br>
is this the case?&quot;
<br>
<p>Possible explanations I can think of are:
<br>
a) We don't really believe lifespan extension of more than 1 yr/yr
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is feasible;
<br>
b) We believe the NanoSantas will make all wealth creation strategies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant;
<br>
c) We believe the SysOp AI will make all wealth creation strategies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant;
<br>
d) We belive the singularity will so totally disrupt things that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all wealth creation strategies are irrelevant.
<br>
<p>There are probably some others but I think this may cover
<br>
most of the positions.
<br>
<p>We could have a long discussion about the synergistic effects
<br>
of biomedical technology, computers, Moore's Law, AI, etc.
<br>
that make it impossible to disentangle lifespan extension
<br>
from NanoSantas from SysOps from singularities, but in
<br>
the end the question would remain -- Do you want to bet
<br>
your future survivability on the requirement that the
<br>
Nanosantas, Sysops or singularities manifest themselves?
<br>
<p>Does one want to be in a position in 30-50 years of
<br>
having an extended lifespan (through in-the-trenches
<br>
advances in medical technology) but not have the ability
<br>
to live independently and dedicate ones resources to
<br>
such things as the development of NanoSantas or SysOps
<br>
or Singularities?
<br>
<p>To my mind, what may be needed is the establishment of
<br>
an &quot;I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation&quot; for people
<br>
who adopt and promote this perspective.  It is a fundamental
<br>
shift from the:
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;I'm born, I work, I may have children, I retire, I die&quot;
<br>
to an 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm born, I work, I may have children, I retire, I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;contribute my time and energy to the benefit of humanity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for an indefinite period, someday an accident may catch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;up with me.&quot;
<br>
framework.
<br>
<p>Please note that I'm not suggesting this be &quot;imposed&quot; on
<br>
people as there may certainly be those who do not have
<br>
this perspective.  But given the social perspectives
<br>
that most humans seem to have at a genetic level, I
<br>
think it is likely to be a strategy many would adopt.
<br>
<p>So I'm curious...
<br>
<p>Who wants to join the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation?&quot;
<br>
and is willing to walk their talk?
<br>
