</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columbia in Washington/Oregon or the Sacramento
</em><br>
<em>&gt; River delta
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; one sees three appalling examples of wasted of fresh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; water.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet isn't overpopulated, not even close.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just under utilizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its fresh water resources and sunlight resources. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spike
</em><br>
<p>And the Yukon and the Amazon, etc.  To my
<br>
knowledge--thoroughly anecdotal in this matter--among
<br>
major rivers, only the Nile withers to nothing in its
<br>
delta, never reaching the Mediterranean.  The Amazon,
<br>
in contrast, was discovered when a Spanish ship's
<br>
captain noticed that the ocean water he was sailing
<br>
through was substantially fresh, a hundred miles out
<br>
to sea.
<br>
<p>For the record, I consider the &quot;population problem&quot; to
<br>
be 95% Henny Penny hysteria.  The vast, virtually
<br>
unpopulated open spaces of the world--Sahara desert,
<br>
Central Austrailia, Argentine steppes, the Canadian
<br>
and Siberian north, and, of course, the 70% of the
<br>
earth's surface that is water (not to mention the 70%
<br>
of the solid surface which lies beneath that
<br>
water)--lie unused because they are SURPLUS, and
<br>
logistically, somewhat inconvenient to use.  Ergo,
<br>
there's plenty of space available for a vastly greater
<br>
multiple of humans than the current population.
<br>
<p>The challenge of meeting the material needs of any
<br>
biological population ultimately boils down to
<br>
adequacy of energy supply, and as Larry Niven pointed
<br>
out in Ringworld and Robert Bradbury has repeatedly
<br>
inferred in his discussions of solar system
<br>
engineering, the final limiting factor in the energy
<br>
utilization formula is the disposal of waste heat.  
<br>
<p>Energy is what is required to appropriately configure
<br>
elemental materials to meet human needs.  To make
<br>
food, unmake waste, to build things, to heat, to cool,
<br>
and transport things, and to allow us to process
<br>
information, all requires energy.  
<br>
<p>The raw energy incident on the surface of our planet
<br>
is 1.7 e11 megawatts.  A sizable amount.   And that
<br>
represents a mere 1/2,162,250,000th of the total
<br>
output of the sun.
<br>
<p>There's plenty of energy.
<br>
<p>The problem then--and this is old, old territory--is
<br>
not an excess, present or future, of human
<br>
population--that's a phantom. The problem is an
<br>
overabundance of human misbehavior. In the ongoing
<br>
contest between the primordial and the emergent,
<br>
between ancient reptilian ruthlessness and
<br>
neo-homo-mammalian
<br>
consciouness-and-rationality-mediated self-control,...
<br>
which will prevail?  We et the apple, strapped
<br>
ourselves in, and now we're waiting for the fat lady
<br>
to sing.
<br>
<p>Fix the problem.  Enhance.  Transcend.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
