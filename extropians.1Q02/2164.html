<p>
<em>&gt; &gt;To create is to be fully human. To create life is surely a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subset of that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;For some reason I feel that to equate us with gods, or to strive for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;perceived godhood, is somehow missing the fullness of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an interesting point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just thought of this analogy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
</em><br>
<p>Not to the technologist
<br>
<p><em>&gt; vs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any sufficiently advanced (post)human is indistinguishable from a god.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not to the posthuman
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the vast majority of us here, i imagine, would deny the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of &quot;magic&quot; or &quot;god&quot; in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sense that most people take them. (even i would, and i'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own god and happen to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be quite fond of magick :) ), but how many of us would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flat-out deny that we don't want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology that is indistinguishable from magic?
</em><br>
<p>I want to be able to understand it better than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both magic and god are creations of humanity, but both, imho, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are things to be stroven 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards. (is stroven a word?)
</em><br>
<p>You can't strive toward magic; it is in essence indefinable, and thus
<br>
untargetable. It contains the set of all (or some?) things that we cannot
<br>
comprehend. By definition, as we come to comprehend them, they cease to be
<br>
magical, and become part of the toolkit.
<br>
<p>Off the top of my head, striving for &quot;God&quot; has a couple of interpretations.
<br>
It can mean striving for potence and control... I can agree with that (gee,
<br>
what a blokey definition!). But I would not label it God.
<br>
<p>Or, it could mean striving to somehow become closer to that which is greater
<br>
than/beyond us, and on that score, who really gives a rat's? If this concept
<br>
even makes sense, I suspect that the closer we get to &quot;god&quot;, the less
<br>
interesting it will become. It wont become any less pointless, of course,
<br>
having started at the maximum on that scale.
