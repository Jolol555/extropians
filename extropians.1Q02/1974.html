<em>   &gt;To me this seems true, silicon, and new nanotechnology relentlessly
</em><br>
advances
<br>
<em>   &gt;hardware.  But software seems more of the same.  I think it is less
</em><br>
amenable
<br>
<em>   &gt;to automation than say wafer fabrication.
</em><br>
<p>Gregory Bateson used to say, I think, that intelligence basically was the
<br>
ability to find the pattern that connects two objects or events. I'm curious
<br>
why we've had so little luck devising programs that can do this.
<br>
<p>Here in Singapore, as elsewhere in Asia that I've lived (and that's a lot of
<br>
places), it's consensus that Asians (meaning people reared in Asian
<br>
educational systems) tend not to be as creative as people from &quot;western&quot;
<br>
backgrounds. (Don't blame me, I didn't make this up - one highly educated
<br>
Indian has a bestseller called &quot;Can Asians Think?&quot; and another bestseller
<br>
I've seen wriiten by a Chinese chap is called, get this, &quot;Why Asians are
<br>
less creative than westerners.&quot;) And to be sure, the weight of the evidence,
<br>
at least as far as modern technology is concerned, would seem to suggest
<br>
that western cultures have the jump on innovation.
<br>
<p>But. If intelligence includes innovation, then innovation also would seem to
<br>
involve generating and testing &quot;patterns which connect.&quot; It ought,
<br>
therefore, to be possible to construct an algorithm for pattern generation
<br>
and testing, and thereby to create a bona fide intelligent machine. I don't
<br>
think I'm on new ground here, at least not on the &quot;is it possible?&quot;
<br>
proposition. Maybe a bit more so on the question of why we ain't done it
<br>
yet.
<br>
<p>Penrose wrote that book, which I never got round to reading, which purported
<br>
to prove why it wasn't possible. I ignored it at the time, believing that
<br>
since identifying a connecting pattern was a simple exercise in going meta
<br>
to the two objects or events, it was missing the point on what intelligence
<br>
really was. But that was ten years ago, and nothing much seems to have
<br>
happened on the AI front since then. Thoughts?
<br>
<p>Because if we can create a pattern-generating algorithm, we can commoditise
<br>
innovation itself. That solves your software development problem overnight,
<br>
and we can move on to cooler issues like pattern-generating algorithm
<br>
generators. Wherein we find the very essence of reality.
