<p>I don't know if I have it on tape, but I have most of the questions and my 
<br>
answers, which I will gladly post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd love to interview you again, eventually. But as you know I've been

</em><br>
<p>Regarding Max not responding to your requests, it isn't that he &quot;refused&quot;, 
<br>
but that he either didn't have time, out of town, etc.  He did say that he 
<br>
is not interested in doing your show if you continue to misrepresent 
<br>
extropians and ExI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for the articulateness of the political perspective that we need to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;diversity of voices. I don't think it makes sense to expect a single
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rather I would like to see the WTA comes to emcompass &gt;Hists with views
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ranging from libertarianism (the extrops) to social democracy, and together
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we can express a United Front against the Luddites and the fascists (alleged
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>James, please think about what you are saying.  You continue to push and 
<br>
prod to set up extropians as being definitively libertarian to give WTA's 
<br>
new plan a reason to exist.  I understand the marketing:  Make A. appear to 
<br>
be X and B appear to be Y and you have a reason why X and Y are 
<br>
incompatible, or Y vs. X.  What you are not acknowledging is that A 
<br>
contains aspects of Y and X, as well as Z.
<br>
<p>If you accepted that extropians are not only or just &quot;libertarians&quot;, you 
<br>
wouldn't have an argument. This is the point I have been trying to make to 
<br>
you and your peers which does not seems to latch on.  Once you realize that 
<br>
this argument doesn't hold you will have to come up with an other cause for 
<br>
WTA.  I think this really needs to be addressed or there can be no true 
<br>
communication.
<br>
<p>Well-known business analyst Al Ries's outlines a marketing language -- 
<br>
&quot;positioning&quot; yourself and repositioning existing organizations to make 
<br>
more room for yourself.  (The best selling book _Positioning the Battle for 
<br>
the Mind_ outlines this strategy.) Trying to put ExI or extropians in a 
<br>
small corner of transhumanism and claim all the rest while also welcoming 
<br>
that small corner, is a clear machination of the true situation.
<br>
<p>I had hoped that WTA would realize its original premise of being an 
<br>
academic organization.  I don't know why that didn't work, but trying to be 
<br>
a &quot;new&quot; political organization for transhumanists is going run into some 
<br>
problems.  It simply won't work with the current strategy, which I stated 
<br>
above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think it would be a wonderful step in this process for you to organize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pro-Act as a &gt;Hist 501.c.4, i.e. a political lobby, and begin to do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things that lobbys do: raise money from (especially) wealthy (but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plebian) donors, identify &gt;Hist candidates to support (hopefully both Dem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Rep), channel money to them, and then work the halls of Congress on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behalf of our political interests:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-       More funding for scitech education and research, esp. nanotech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;silicon-neural interface, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-       Stop the Luddite anti-reprotech and anti-cloning laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-       End the Drug War
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-       Fund the space program
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'course I'd also argue for expanding the agenda in a social justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction (bridging the digital divide, national health insurance to cover
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high tech procedures for the poor) but I can't expect perfection...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That would make a real contribution, and I suspect that you might just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the right person to put the squeeze on a lot of rich businessmen.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this would be great.  And, time will tell.  I certainly would like to 
<br>
see some changes made.  At this moment the only entity I'm squeezing is my 
<br>
delightful husband and our cats -:)
<br>
<p>I do think there is a way, a manner, in dealing with the businesspeople who 
<br>
need a way to unload some money for worthy causes.   They would need a tax 
<br>
write off for it and proud of the association it brings them.  This is what 
<br>
I'm currently thinking about.
