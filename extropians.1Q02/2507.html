<p>Caveat: I have not read this article.  *But* the significant differences
<br>
in the relationship between teleomere shortening in mice and humans and
<br>
aging should caution us against extrapolations from mice to humans.
<br>
<p>I would freely accept that GH supplementation in humans might accelerate
<br>
cancer progression.  That however might be counteracted by angiogenesis
<br>
inhibitors.  On the other hand GH supplementation might contribute to
<br>
increased muscle mass that would tend to reduce falls, hip fractures,
<br>
long periods of hospital down time and decreased mobility.
<br>
<p>&quot;Aging&quot; is a complex multifactorial process.  Extrapolating conclusions
<br>
from GH supplementation in mice into humans is an *iffy* proposition --
<br>
as is supplementing GH in humans on the basis of limited studies.
<br>
It might be entirely true that GH supplementation could have a longevity
<br>
promoting effect for the elderly in some environments and a longevity
<br>
diminishing effect for the elderly in other environments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This reminds me about two of my patients, a married couple, who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending a fortune on GH supplementation, dreaming of staying forever young,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but most likely just speeding up a rush towards an early grave, all because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they read some quack's book on the alleged benefits of GH. And they wife was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very tanned, too - she looked ten years older than she was. 
</em><br>
<p>Clearly GH is not the &quot;one answer&quot; -- provided people realize that and
<br>
carefully balance risks and benefits, I do not think they should be
<br>
prevented from using it.  At the same time it would be useful for
<br>
physicians to generate a meta-database of results based on such
<br>
individuals who are willing to treat themselves as &quot;experimental vehicles&quot;.
<br>
Ultimately one wants to tie it back to genetic and lifestyle data so
<br>
one can determine when GH is likely to help more than it hurts.
<br>
<p>In fact there is a completely orthogonal judgement vector that
<br>
extropians should consider -- a drug might actually serve to
<br>
shorten life, but significantly increases the quality of that
<br>
life.  The length of life x quality of life product is one that
<br>
has a very subjective valuation.  We must always be careful to
<br>
look to the person whose life is involved to ascertain those
<br>
values.
