<p>An extropic perspective would evaluate whether the parent
<br>
or the child were contributing &quot;more&quot; to information content
<br>
of the universe (where judging the &quot;value&quot; of such information
<br>
content is of course &quot;relatively&quot; subjective).
<br>
<p>A &quot;pure&quot; extopic perspective would not consider the relative
<br>
value of self-conscious moral actors.  It would simply create
<br>
valuations on the basis of results produced and allocate
<br>
resources accordingly.  If one occupies resources that are
<br>
deemed to be used unproductively, one can expect to have
<br>
such resourcs reallocated for more productive purposes.
<br>
<p>I.e. -- &quot;You are the weakest link, Good Bye&quot;.
<br>
<p>### I keep wondering what would be the material carrier of the extropic
<br>
perspective as defined by you. You seem to refer to the &quot;extropic
<br>
perspective&quot; as something independent from the &quot;self-conscious moral
<br>
actors&quot;, yet I imagine that only such self-conscious entities would be able
<br>
to adopt it. Should that happen, their long-term survival might be adversely
<br>
affected (as in &quot;no consideration for the relative value of self-conscious
<br>
moral actors&quot;).
<br>
<p>I would tend to have a different opinion on the ultimate source of such
<br>
high-level ethical systems. Our way of thinking about values developed
<br>
during milions of years of evolution, which favored the survival of minds
<br>
somewhat selfish, but able to cooperate. Our highest ethical principles turn
<br>
out to be (largely) the optimal traits needed for very-long term survival in
<br>
a hunter gatherer society, modified by a few thousand years of memetic
<br>
evolution in more complex societies, again boosting the survival of persons
<br>
(and societies) with the right memes.
<br>
<p>Presumably, the same pattern will hold for transhuman entities - their
<br>
ethical positions will evolve (perhaps by design) for maximum survival
<br>
advantage. Since aggression against large and advanced entities (such as
<br>
your parent civilization) can be dangerous, the likelihood of such
<br>
aggression would depend on how much benefit would accrue to the attacker,
<br>
versus the chance of a catastrophic failure (as in a counterattack by the
<br>
parent civilization). I think it is unlikely that many cases of patricide
<br>
will occur between the stars, simply because it is not good for transhuman
<br>
survival. In the long run, it pays to be nice, as long as behavior-tracking
<br>
and a few other procedures, are possible.
<br>
<p>I also think that the ethical interpretation of extropy (again, for the
<br>
purpose of long-term survival) implies a categorical injunction against the
<br>
unwished-for destruction of innnocent sentience. But this is a different
<br>
subject altogether.
