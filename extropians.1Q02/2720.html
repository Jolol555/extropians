<p>
I've now finished Ventus, by Karl Schroeder.  It should be widely
<br>
available in paperback in the U.S.
<br>
<p>I enjoyed the book very much.  It was a little slow to get going;
<br>
the planet Ventus is trapped in a medieval society, and while there are
<br>
hints of deep secrets and unexplained technologies, mostly we are dealing
<br>
with horseback and swords.  However by about 1/3 of the way through the
<br>
book most of the actors are in place, and we understand the role of the
<br>
struggle on Ventus against a galactic background.  From then on I could
<br>
hardly put the book down.
<br>
<p>The plot unfolds in a linear and logical fashion.  Schroeder avoids
<br>
the tricks so many authors use to hold the reader's interest, dropping
<br>
tantalizing hints and cutting away from characters just as something
<br>
is about to be revealed.  For the most part, when we are warned that
<br>
something interesting is about to happen, it then immediately happens.
<br>
Characters reveal their knowledge freely, as it is needed.  Although there
<br>
is are great mysteries to be solved, the reader has as much information
<br>
as any of the characters.  We learn as they do, and in the end the
<br>
resolution is very satisfying.
<br>
<p>Schroeder's perspective is fundamentally optimistic.  Unlike so many
<br>
authors in this genre, he doesn't feel the need to kill off most of the
<br>
main characters, or to arrange a galactic holocaust.  While there is
<br>
great evil to be faced, the good guys are given a fighting chance to win.
<br>
<p>This shows through in his galactic milieu as well.  I literally got
<br>
tears in my eyes upon learning that the population of the Solar System
<br>
is 70 trillion humans (and others), while Earth is mostly a park with few
<br>
people living there.  How many authors would have the courage to present
<br>
such a future?  And we aren't just tantalized with this description,
<br>
we get to visit these places, get a view of the wonders.
<br>
<p>The visual imagination in the story is extraordinary.  Ventus begs to be
<br>
illustrated.  The Winds, the powerful AIs which control the terraforming
<br>
of Ventus, manifest themselves amazingly.  The Diadem Swans, energy beings
<br>
of the upper atmosphere who can reach down to the surface via nanotech
<br>
threads; the vagabond moons, gigantic aerostats with grappling hooks for
<br>
moving huge quantities of matter about the planet; the shambling morphs
<br>
which create new life forms; the desals, with their shining towers;
<br>
the variety is incredible.
<br>
<p>I do find some weaknesses in the writing.  The characters seem a little
<br>
cold.  They are all pursuing their various missions almost robotically.
<br>
While there is growth and change for virtually everyone, there wasn't
<br>
much conflict.  Most of the time, everyone is working largely at common
<br>
purposes.  I think Schroeder could work on bringing his characters to
<br>
more vivid life.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, the story turns on a moral question.  What is the ideal
<br>
society?  What is the best way for man to live?  Most people in galactic
<br>
society (the Archipelago) apparently live in virtual reality, linked
<br>
into the inscape, the pervasive data net.  People are happy there.
<br>
But some see it as a dead end.  The &quot;tyranny of condescension&quot;, where
<br>
man is ruled by benevolent AI gods, has brought peace and happiness,
<br>
but is that enough?  These are serious issues for budding transhumans
<br>
to consider.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Extropian perspective, I don't think Archipelago society
</em><br>
is ideal.  Most people don't seek to transform and improve themselves.
<br>
They want happiness, indulging in &quot;a permanent orgy inside the computers.&quot;
<br>
But the opportunities are there for more.  At least some people transform
<br>
themselves into gods, merging with AIs or enhancing their biologies.
<br>
However I think you may have to become rich and powerful to achieve
<br>
this transformation, a difficult task in a world with so many others to
<br>
compete against.
<br>
<p>But in many ways I do find this a plausible and basically optimistic
<br>
view of the future.  In a world where benevolent AIs prevent violence
<br>
and harm, it's likely that happiness will be enough for the majority
<br>
of people.  They won't necessarily want to become gods.  They are happy
<br>
with the opportunities open to them.  And for those few who want more,
<br>
the goal can be reached.
<br>
<p>Overall, I strongly recommend this book for Extropians, or anyone
<br>
interested in future societies involving gods and men.  The blurbs
<br>
printed in the book compare Schroeder to Vinge, Egan and Banks among
<br>
others; while I don't think his writing is as polished as theirs, this
<br>
is a highly promising first novel.  The Archipelago and Ventus represent
<br>
new and useful models of future worlds where we might want to live.
<br>
