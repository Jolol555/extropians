<p>I've been converted into a firm believer in eliminating unnecessary
<br>
risks to my long term survival. Especially relatively easy things to
<br>
do like signing up with Alcor. So yes, I am hedged. The two things you
<br>
are talking about are almost completely separate issues, and any
<br>
combo Extropian/Singularitarian would have to have a very interesting
<br>
reason to not sign up for cryonics. No matter how soon you think the
<br>
Singularity is arriving, you still have to anticipate accidents, diseases,
<br>
etc. You'd look pretty darn silly to die irretrievably a year before the
<br>
big event.
<br>
<p>&lt;rant mode on, aimed at no one in particular&gt;
<br>
<p>What's interesting is that the more effort I put into working on this
<br>
stuff, and the more I see achieved, and the closer we get, the more real
<br>
the end result feels to me. And the higher my level of dread at the idea
<br>
of somehow missing out on it all. If you're not feeling much dread when
<br>
you consider doing something unnecessarily risky, then you should be aware
<br>
that you probably don't have a very good appreciation of what you've got to
<br>
lose both right now and in the future. This kind of complacency generally
<br>
leads to making stupid mistakes that are quite embarrassing in hindsight
<br>
(if you should be so lucky as to still be alive). Unfortunately this is
<br>
one of those lessons that many people including myself have to run into
<br>
headfirst before finally &quot;getting it&quot;. Sometimes you don't see the risk
<br>
or take it seriously until it is too late.
<br>
<p>Our society (as demonstrated by the ease of the 9/11 attack) is extremely
<br>
complacent, and still very much so even now. Not only is this affecting
<br>
our security in general, but also it is a huge factor in limiting the
<br>
audience for transhumanism. No one who is content with their life and
<br>
perceived future will be very interested. Paradoxically, the benefits
<br>
that modern technology and prosperity bring to people also makes them
<br>
blind to what is missing or what can be improved. This complacency issue is
<br>
probably what plays a role in taking down whole societies like the Roman
<br>
Empire. Don't let the same thing happen to us- go create some discontent
<br>
now! :-)
<br>
<p>&lt;rant mode off&gt;
<br>
<p>For me, the whole Singularitarianism (note: big difference in this, and
<br>
those who just want to sit around waiting and watching) thing is just
<br>
another way to reduce a reducible risk. The bonus is it does so for the
<br>
whole planet instead of just me. We've even made it simpler to accelerate
<br>
the Singularity than signing up with Alcor- just visit our donations page
<br>
for instructions...
