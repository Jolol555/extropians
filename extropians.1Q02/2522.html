<p><p>Then I am afraid that I am at a loss to get a handle on what you 
<br>
really mean by &quot;work&quot;, &quot;living&quot;, &quot;school&quot; or your understanding 
<br>
of what an intellectual does and does not do or of the effort 
<br>
required.  I get the impression that you have a rather, well 
<br>
classical Marxist view of work being that which is imposed on 
<br>
one by others and any life other than such effort being one of 
<br>
&quot;decadence&quot;.  But that can't be right.
<br>
<p>The original subject was notions of social justice in some 
<br>
getting more rewards than others from which the mundane example 
<br>
of brighter or more scholastically able kids being treated 
<br>
better and getting more goodies than others was thrown in as 
<br>
possibly illustrative.  You seem to have been derailed by it 
<br>
though so I guess it didn't work for the subject at hand.
