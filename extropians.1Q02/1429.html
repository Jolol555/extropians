Amazing hardly seems to capture it.

<p>I think this misses the point. Damien is hardly what you would call &quot;thin
<br>
skinned&quot;. If the owners of this list regularly said that an opinion was &quot;off
<br>
topic&quot; simply because it is not shared by them, I think that many of us
<br>
would be out of here quicksmart. This exchange between Tom and Damien
<br>
appeared to be at least one instance of this: what Damien said was clearly
<br>
in the purview of this list, and yet it was claimed that it was not.
<br>
Although this was not one of the most pleasant exchanges on this list, the
<br>
list is stronger for it, and thus I am glad Damien called him on this. No
<br>
list is perfect, and (to turn a phrase  from Churchhill) the EX list is
<br>
probably the worst transhumanist list--besides all others. Let's keep it
<br>
that way.
