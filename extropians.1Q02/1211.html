<em>&gt;From: &quot;Tom Cowper&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tcowper@capital.net?Subject=Re:%20The%20Integrated%20Military">tcowper@capital.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;First let me say that I am a firm advocate of equality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;integration for women and gays and everyone else that have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traditionally excluded from various white-male-only jobs or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;professions, including the military. My concerns are for frontline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infantry and combat arms units like tanks and artillery.  Yes, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our everyday peacetime lives we all learn to deal effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(success levels vary of course) with inevitable sexual tension. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The reason the frontline military is different is that foxholes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trenches, jungles, and deserts, in a war, are completely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from any other human arena.  Frontline combat is a life and death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;struggle.  Emotions are high, continuously, days and weeks on end. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Life is extremely difficult, both emotionally and physically.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specter of death is all around, always in your face.  Thoughts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death constantly present.  Add to that a preponderance of very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;young adults at the pinnacle of their physical sexuality and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;base of their emotional maturity and sexual experience.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Winning on the battlefield is a function of mind as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical power or strength.  Keeping those young minds focused,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivated, inspired, and under control is a very very difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leadership challenge. Breakdowns in mental and emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discipline hinder combat effectiveness. Historically, the army
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that does the best job of keeping its personnel focused on winning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is usually the army that wins.  As I said before, the issue is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can women endure or fight just as well as men.  The issue is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much combat effectiveness are we willing to sacrifice to include
</em><br>
<em>&gt;women in frontline combat units, interjecting a very significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mental and emotional detractor into an arena where life and death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are the prize for winning and losing?  
</em><br>
<p>I think these are very fair and honest questions and to be sure the
<br>
jury has not even been formed to seriously consider the matter. 
<br>
<p>The point that I am trying to make is that if we want equality, and
<br>
I mean real equality not the PC garbage we've been getting and
<br>
pretending is equality, then certain things would need to change.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The military has it's own double standards about sex (male
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;officers may date female enlisteds but not vice versa) and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;highly resistant to change.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That's not my exactly my experience Brian, though I agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;double standards exist all over the place, right along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good-ol-boy networks and glass ceilings.  In most places that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;served fraternization either way was taboo.  But certainly abuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and double standards still exist.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I had some personnal experience with this. I would guess we could
<br>
agree that double standards are wrong.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;First, &quot;service&quot; does not necessarily have to include integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frontline combat units.  Second, as noted above frontline combat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a completely different world from anyplace else, including law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enforcement, including the YMCA...at least I hope so.  :)   You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't get to go home at night. There is no place to go for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;privacy.  No time to set up separate bathrooms or sleeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arrangements.  No beds, no time outs, no showers, little sleep. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Physical relationships and emotional bonds extremely close.  Throw
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sex into that mix, and ok, no doubt some can handle it well.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Others, a significant number of people both male and female will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not, and the resulting turmoil will seriously impact combat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effectiveness.  IMO. Lastly, I was a Marine from 1978-1983 (Went
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through OCS at Quantico in 1975).  2ndMarDiv Camp Lejeune, 1st
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Battalion 8th Marines.  Where were you stationed?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I agree with the difficulties of front line units, and I know that
<br>
despite the fact that in theory you should be able to stand a
<br>
Marine at attention in the middle of a cheerleaders shower room
<br>
without his eyes moving from &quot;front and center&quot;, realistically
<br>
things are going to happen. 
<br>
<p>I think if this is instilled from the start then things can change.
<br>
Most guys don't have sex with their sisters, and with proper
<br>
training I'd think most wouldn't indulge in sex with their
<br>
squadmates.
<br>
<p>Come to think of it isn't &quot;proper&quot; sex just a matter of the correct
<br>
time and place. Isn't the difference just a matter of
<br>
professionalism?
<br>
<p>This is brainstorming by the way.
<br>
<p>I spent mid '76 to mid 78 with VMA(AW)533 at Cherry Point N.C and
<br>
mid '78 to mid 79 with VMA(AW)224 in Iwakuni Japan. (MOS 6637) 
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The only fair solution I've seen was a fully integrated unit as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; portrayed in &quot;Starship Troopers.&quot; &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; book that convinced me to join the USMC and I was delighted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; learn it's now on the boot camp recommended reading list.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Yup, read it twice.  However, it's been quite a while since my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last reading, before the movie came out.  My recollection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(admittedly flawed on occasion) is the book didn't deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sexual integration at all.  No shower scenes that I can remember. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the fully integrated showers was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Paul Verhoeven creation.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah the original still had the sexes rigorously separated aboard
<br>
ship, maybe Heinlein was smarter than us, but I thought the movie
<br>
version with it's integrated units was very thought provoking. (And
<br>
a great shower scene ;) )
<br>
<p><p>Nothing like seeing something actually being done (even by
<br>
hollywood) to give it some thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As far as fair is concerned, there may be ways to achieve combat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equality without putting males and females together in frontline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;units.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Okay, lets play with the concept.
<br>
<p>We segregate men and women in the military now to avoid the
<br>
consequences of potentially complicating sexual encounters.
<br>
<p>Now if we are to be fair and permit gays and lesbians to serve,
<br>
where are you going to put them?
<br>
<p>It isn't fair to put the Gays with the &quot;straights&quot;, or the Lesbians
<br>
with the &quot;Straights&quot; and you can't put Gays with Gays, and Lesbians
<br>
with Lesbians for the same reasons!
<br>
<p>Ball in your court...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Change can be difficult, and so is progress, but essential.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Agreed.  Completely.  But human evolutionary biology doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change overnight.  Adapting to technology is one thing.  Changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attitudes about race and sexual orientation, a matter of education
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and tolerance.  Sex is biology.  The emotions associated with it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very hard to change in the short run.  No doubt that over time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given the significant changes we will see in the human species in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the coming decades, the sex part will change as well.  And I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grant you that we COULD integrate tomorrow.  My caution is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undoubtedly our combat effectiveness will suffer from doing it.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And in a world still filled with Osamas and Sadamms we may pay a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very dear price for that particular approach to equality.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree that readiness is first and foremost and must be maintained
<br>
at any cost.
<br>
<p>What do you think of the idea of creating some integrated units as
<br>
an experiment? You'd get plenty of volunteers I bet!
