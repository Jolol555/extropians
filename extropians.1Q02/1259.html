<em>&gt;&gt;I don't think it is accurate to say gay dating or sex is illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in most US states.  A handful of states still have sodomy laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they selectively enforce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, I just checked this at a law site.  Only 17/50 U.S. states still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such laws on the books.  That's one-third instead of &quot;most&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Thanks for checking and for the data.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the state of Florida, where I live, gay sex violates sodomy laws.  Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws don't even let married heterosexual couples engage in sodomy.  Not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is this type of sex illegal, but soliciting illegal sex violates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solicitation laws.  Thus, asking for gay sex or for a gay date that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include sex is illegal.  Loitering for illicit purposes includes looking for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partners for illegal sexual activities.  Thus, waiting around for a possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gay date to show up is also illegal.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>It does not follow that a guy asking a guy for a date is going 
<br>
to engage in sodomy.  There are a few more gay male sexual 
<br>
practices than that and, contrary to popular believe, not all 
<br>
gay guys screw every time opportunity knocks in any case.  So it 
<br>
does not follow that asking for a date is illegal.  Nor does it 
<br>
follow that the cops can know what someone is loitering for 
<br>
necessarily. So just standing around is certainly not illegal. 
<br>
You seem to have a pretty strained concept of law.
<br>
<p>And I don't see anything about lesbians at all so I guess we are free and clear. :)
<br>
<p>Also, Key West is one of the biggest gay male scenes in the 
<br>
country.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These laws are alive and well.  Florida forbids unmarried adults from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sharing a hotel room.  The tourism council tried to get this reversed a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago, but failed.  We just had a controversy where Jeb Bush's son was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught by police violating the sodomy laws with a female.  Since he was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charged by police, gay rights activists asked Jeb to pardon gays in jail for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaking the same law.  This never happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Do you really think they enforce this role on unmarried adults 
<br>
in a hotel room?  I can tell you for certain that they do not 
<br>
unless it is very political.  It is really disgusting they would 
<br>
put people in jail just for consensual sex.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I know most of these laws seem like something out of the 1800's, but most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them have never been officially repealed.  When repeals are attempted, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious right objects to the repeal.  Even if the law isn't enforced, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawmakers don't want to appear to be encouraging unmarried sexual behavior,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so they don't vote for the repeals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>And most are almost never enforced.  Thankfully.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I concede that most gays ignore these laws with no consequences, but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are gays in jail for nothing more than having gay sex or soliciting for gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, although it is thankfully decreasing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Check out &lt;<a href="http://www.sodomylaws.org/">http://www.sodomylaws.org/</a>&gt; for more details on these laws.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penalties range from life imprisonment, 20 years, 15 years, 10 years, 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, 6 months, 60 days, and a $500 fine.  By the way, my state's example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above have the most lenient laws with only 60 days in jail or a $500 fine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Life for that?  People the barricades!  This is too much.
