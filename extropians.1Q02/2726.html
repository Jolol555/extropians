<p>FBI: Left Wing Green Terrorists the most active terror organization in the
<br>
U.S
<br>
Report by J.J. Johnson - Sierra Times.com: 02.13.02
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON -- Move over Al-Queda. It's now official: The Earth Liberation
<br>
Front, a left wing organization that has carried out 600 attacks since 1996
<br>
has become the largest and most active U.S.-based terrorist group, the FBI's
<br>
top domestic terrorism officer said Tuesday.
<br>
But you might see this report buried in the inside of your Wednesday fish
<br>
wrap. Kenneth Lay will get all the glory for taking the fifth in front of
<br>
Congress Tuesday. But the House Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health's
<br>
efforts to shed light on the Earth Liberation Front and it's partners in
<br>
crime, the Animal Liberation Front, were frustrated when former ELF
<br>
spokesman Craig Rosebraugh also refused to answer questions from members of
<br>
Congress. Go figure - he's got more to hide.
<br>
<p>Remember: According to the FBI, Rosebraugh's organization has done more
<br>
damage in America than even the Enron Corporation.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'll take the Fifth Amendment,&quot; Rosebraugh said more than 50 times to
<br>
questions ranging from whether he helped produce an ELF terrorist training
<br>
film to who was paying for his attorney.
<br>
<p>Rosebraugh was subpoenaed to testify by Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo.,
<br>
Chairman of the House Subcommittee.
<br>
<p>As published here in the past at Sierra Times, Rosebraugh was the mouthpiece
<br>
for the left-wing, extremist terrorists organization. He at least admitted
<br>
relaying anonymous messages on ELF's behalf from 1997 until he quit last
<br>
September, but had no firsthand knowledge of any attacks.
<br>
<p>Innocent Arabs are in jail for less.
<br>
<p>Here's the price tag in the name of green worship: $43 million in more than
<br>
600 attacks since 1996 (yes, they've been busy). Their tradecraft includes
<br>
spray-painting graffiti, breaking windows, firebombing research centers and
<br>
ski resorts. $12 million alone in the Vail, Colorado attack. This all
<br>
according to FBI expert James F. Jarboe.
<br>
<p>&quot;They're the most active. They cause the most damage,&quot; Jarboe told the
<br>
subcommittee, but the state-sponsored news version will make sure to let you
<br>
know that white supremacist groups are still considered more dangerous
<br>
because their attacks are often aimed at people. What they won't tell you is
<br>
that no white supremacist group is listed as a 'terrorist organization' by
<br>
the FBI, and urban gang members attack more people than anyone. But keeping
<br>
statistics like those could get one labeled 'insensitive'
<br>
<p>Nobody has been killed in an ELF or ALF attack yet, but McInnis said it is
<br>
wrong to think of the green terrorists as &quot;nature-loving hippies&quot; or
<br>
misguided youths. Such would be an insult to &quot;nature-loving hippies&quot; and
<br>
misguided youths, respectively.
<br>
<p>&quot;These are hardened criminals,&quot; he said. &quot;They are dangerous, they are
<br>
well-funded, they are savvy, sophisticated and stealthy, and if their
<br>
violence continues to escalate, it is only a matter of time before their
<br>
parade of terror results in a lost human life.&quot;
<br>
<p>When a crime happens with a firearm, some politician attempts to repeal the
<br>
right to keep and bear arms from the citizenry. Six hundred acts of
<br>
terrorism costing $43 million, and no one dares mention repealing the
<br>
Endangered Species Act, or the Antiquities Act of 1906 - the laws passed
<br>
that fuel the fire for these terrorists.
<br>
<p>In a report the ELF and ALF issued last month, the groups admitted
<br>
responsibility for 67 illegal actions in 2001, including burning down a $5.4
<br>
million horticulture building at the University of Washington. Gutsy, huh?
<br>
<p>In 1998, the ELF claimed responsibility for an arson attack at Vail Ski
<br>
Resort that did $12 million in damage.
<br>
<p>Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he understands that die-hard
<br>
environmentalists are frustrated with some of the Bush administration's
<br>
policies, but eco-terrorism hurts the cause by making it harder for him and
<br>
others to promote more environmental-friendly policies. Of course, the
<br>
Democrat, Inslee is not partisan about the matter - even though the ELF's
<br>
path of destruction has been ongoing since 1996 - when Bush wasn't
<br>
president.
<br>
<p>Rosebraugh's attorney/mouthpiece, Stuart Sugarman, said he wanted &quot;to thank
<br>
Mr. McInnis for providing attention for this important cause,&quot; as if the
<br>
hearings were merely a way to further the cause of eco-terrorism.
<br>
<p>Just this Monday in Phoenix, one of their fellow terror-warriors, Mark Sands
<br>
was sentenced to 18 years in prison for torching seven luxury homes under
<br>
construction as he tried to stop development near protected desert areas. He
<br>
also admitted writing letters to the media and property owners warning that
<br>
the fires would continue as long as people continued to build next to the
<br>
protected land in Phoenix and Scottsdale. One note, found April 29 said,
<br>
``You build, we burn again.''
