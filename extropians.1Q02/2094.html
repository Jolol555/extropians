I think what Eliezer means is that Alden proposal implies selection for the
<br>
&quot;good&quot; of the group. In fact, this is only ever a side-effect of natural
<br>
selection on individuals.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In the long run, you'd think that those species which accidentally develop
<br>
characteristics that help the species in some overall way (like an optimised
<br>
mutation rate), should do better than those which do not. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All thinking about evolution at the group level suffers from a particular
<br>
problem... even if there is some beneficial trait that the group should
<br>
theoretically adopt, you must always consider whether there is a &quot;cheating&quot;
<br>
strategy that individual genes could adopt, which would take &quot;unfair&quot;
<br>
advantage of the group strategy, and probably end up compromising it. For
<br>
instance, imagine a species which regulates its use of the environmental
<br>
food supply by eating sparsely and breeding at a careful rate, and as a
<br>
result has continued resource supply indefinitely. That seems like a pretty
<br>
good idea. Except that it is prone to a selfish strategy, where one genetic
<br>
branching mutates to remove the regulation. It consumes resources and
<br>
multiplies much more quickly. This branch would likely be fitter (takes in
<br>
more resources), and would become numerous rather quickly, eventually
<br>
dominating the group.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There may be a short term/long term problem, too, with the mutation
<br>
maximisation idea. There may be many instances where such species are
<br>
out-competed in the short term by others with more immediately beneficial
<br>
characteristics (even though they may be long term detrimental). For
<br>
instance, a species which has a lower mutation rate might not adapt so well
<br>
in the long run, but it might have a higher percentage of individuals which
<br>
are healthy at any time, thus its population is fitter and likely comes at
<br>
lower resource cost.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Also, a species which can successfully spawn mutants at a relatively high
<br>
rate has another problem; it's going to end up creating offshoots which
<br>
eventually will be different enough that they wont be able to interbreed
<br>
with the original group. Suddenly, rather than adapting, this species
<br>
creates competitors, as their niches are likely still very similar. On the
<br>
level of the group this is bad, on the level of the individual it's good,
<br>
excepting that if your species gets outcompeted then your individual genes
<br>
are toast.
