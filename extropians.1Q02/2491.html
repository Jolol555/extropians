Scerir forwards:
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; In order for the eye to be able to focus an image on the retina, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the axial length of the eye needs to be just right. If the eye is too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long (or too short), then the image is perpetually focused in front 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the retina (or behind it). The result is nearsightedness (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farsightedness). It turns out that the retina of the eye plays a big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; role in making sure that the axial length of the eye is just right. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How? Well, the retina has the ability to determine whether an image 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;in focus&quot; or &quot;out of focus.&quot; If an image is &quot;out of focus&quot; then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the retina emits chemical signals that control the growth of the eye, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it either longer or shorter, as needed, so that the image can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be focused properly.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting phenomenon.  The other obvious question is, even if the
<br>
retina can tell that the image is out of focus, how does it know whether
<br>
the focal plane is in front of or behind the retina?  In other words,
<br>
how does it know which way to grow in order to correct the problem?
<br>
That sounds even harder than determining whether the image is in focus
<br>
or not.
<br>
<p>I wonder if they are barking up the wrong tree, and it is a signal from
<br>
the lens that does the trick, maybe some subtle chemical wafting through
<br>
the vitreous humor.
