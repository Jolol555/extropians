<p><p>I should have made myself clearer. Sorry.
<br>
<p>You make the mistake of thinking that I was referring simply to people who 
<br>
inherited money from their parents. But I was actually thinking of lucky us 
<br>
-- us on this list. I would not be considered wealthy by many in Australia 
<br>
or USA -- my total income is currently about US$75 per week. I am 
<br>
nevertheless very wealthy when compared against the bulk of humanity, and 
<br>
consider myself extremely priveleged. I have no intention of wasting that 
<br>
privelege though, and am building my own business that hopefully will 
<br>
increase my income 100-fold soon.
<br>
<p>Whether we acknowledge it or not we have all benefitted from a social 
<br>
contract. Over many centuries people have built up all the knowledge and 
<br>
capabilities that we wield.
<br>
<p>There is no such thing as a self made man. Each of us here has got here 
<br>
largely through the efforts of countless generations of people before us 
<br>
and those around us now.
<br>
<p>If someone uses this knowledge and power for the general good then they may 
<br>
do well out of it or not, but it is unlikely that those around them will 
<br>
hate them for it. However if they decide that they owe nobody anything and 
<br>
contribute as little as possible then they should not be surprised or feign 
<br>
moral outrage when those around them consider them parasitic or work 
<br>
against their interests.
<br>
<p>We are all free to help the rest of humanity or to contribute nothing, or 
<br>
anything in between. In a very real sense we owe nobody anything, but at 
<br>
the same time it is easy to see how it makes good sense to live by rules 
<br>
that ensure people give back to society in some kind of proportion to their 
<br>
capability. It prevents things becoming too lopsided -- it is in nobody's 
<br>
interests to create a very deep social divide that results in violent 
<br>
revolution.
<br>
<p>I have seen plenty of people (particularly on this list) say that they 
<br>
object to having to comply with a social contract that is not of their 
<br>
making, but they are not seeing the whole picture. If they really want no 
<br>
part of the deal I don't think there'd be much objection to them opting 
<br>
out. The problem comes when they want to keep all the benefits from society 
<br>
without complying with its commonsense rules.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
