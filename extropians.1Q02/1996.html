<p>James thanks for bringing back fond memories of my misspent youth.
<br>
The Florida town where I grew up was formerly acres upon acres of
<br>
citrus groves.  Most yards in the tracts had one or more trees.  The
<br>
neighbor lady used to pick the stuff and put it in grocery bags out front
<br>
with a big sign &quot;free fruit, or $1 donation per bag.&quot;  I guess it was an
<br>
easy place to be poor: a homeless person would not perish of exposure
<br>
as it was warm, and it would be nearly impossible to starve to death in
<br>
that town.  A sluggard would feel pretty silly holding a &quot;will work for
<br>
food&quot; sign with food hanging on trees all around.
<br>
<p>Hey that gives me an idea.  Most places could set up public farms
<br>
and trees.  Then when the will-work-for-fooders show up, they have
<br>
a place to work if they really mean it: maintaining the public farms.
<br>
They would be free to devour all they can eat.  We could even set
<br>
up army tents out there.  People would donate sleeping bags and
<br>
clothing and such, especially if they saw will-work-for-fooders
<br>
actually doing so.  spike
