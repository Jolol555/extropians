<p>Robert, have you done any kind of survey of investing habits in our 
<br>
community? (That would be an interesting poll for ExI-Community.) Perhaps 
<br>
you have not seen evidence because you have not asked for it. Do you have 
<br>
any evidence to the contrary?
<br>
<p>I can say that I have been a net saver for the last five or six years. 
<br>
First this was to dig out of $30,000 of credit card debt accumulated as a 
<br>
grad student and as someone on a limited work visa. (For a while some years 
<br>
ago I could *only* work for ExI at an extremely low salary.) Over the last 
<br>
few years I maintained a high savings rate (though no longer 50%). It 
<br>
hasn't come to much, alas, due to the steep tech decline of the last two 
<br>
years, though I did have the foresight to be building two other more stable 
<br>
reserves.
<br>
<p>As Hal noted, it really is *not* safe in the long run to invest and forgot. 
<br>
Almost every country has been through periods where you were likely to lose 
<br>
everything. The US is almost the only exception (if you'd stayed invested 
<br>
through the Depression, you would have come out ahead within a decade or 
<br>
so, longer if you only started investing near the peak).  But your basic 
<br>
point is right on. Again, Hal has a good point. You need to consider your 
<br>
life-cycle (or trajectory). Saving heavily in early years of relatively low 
<br>
income may not be optimal. On the other hand I would argue that (almost) 
<br>
*always* saving gets you into a healthy habit. The amount can be varied 
<br>
from 10% on up, but maintaining net savings means you are building personal 
<br>
financial extropy year after year.
<br>
<p>This topic is another one that cries out for a good Extropy article... 
<br>
&quot;Optimal Investment Strategies for the Very Long-Lived&quot; or &quot;Optimal 
<br>
Investment Strategies for Negligible Senescence.&quot;
<br>
<p>Robert, do you want to suggest wording for an ExI-Community poll? We could 
<br>
get some better data.
