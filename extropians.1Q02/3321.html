As someone who would like to become an artist, I can sympathise with your
<br>
viewpoint, Vanessa.
<br>
I would really like to make money by selling my art (of course, that would
<br>
not be my primary purpose),
<br>
but no matter how much they offered me I would not sell anything to people
<br>
who told me they wanted to
<br>
publicly burn my pictures!
<br>
Some of my thoughts on the matter:
<br>
A contract between artist and buyer in which the buyer gives the artist
<br>
access to their work,
<br>
and which forbids the buyer from destroying the work?
<br>
Keeping the original painting and selling copies of it as posters/greeting
<br>
cards etc etc etc?
<br>
Leasing the painting for a specified period?
<br>
<p>However I cannot agree that art is entirely subjective.
<br>
(I am an Objectivist but I dont completely agree with Ayn Rands theories on
<br>
art, great artist though she was.
<br>
My view is that art has 2 purposes- 1 beauty, 2 to make you think about/look
<br>
at things a different way.
<br>
IMO Ayn Rands books acheive both.)
<br>
Obviously all people have different experiences, different tastes, different
<br>
personalities.
<br>
All people look at life in slightly different ways. But there are things
<br>
which most people
<br>
find beautiful.  Example- someone draws a picture depicting a decomposing
<br>
corpse, and
<br>
another paints a happy person enjoying life.
<br>
Very few people would say that the 1st one is more valuable or more
<br>
beautiful.
<br>
Another example is more biological- most humans of the same sexuality find
<br>
the same features attractive,
<br>
of course with individual variations of taste and often with a preference
<br>
for the same race.
<br>
I would find it hard to believe that someone could find a portrait of a
<br>
particularly unattractive, deformed,
<br>
unhealthy person more beatiful or valuable than a picture of someone who
<br>
conforms to a reasonably objective
<br>
standard of beauty.
<br>
Maybe you think this is narrow-minded, but I think there can be an objective
<br>
standard of worth, if not beauty.
<br>
<p>The other thing, I cant understand why you think the audience determines the
<br>
value of a work.
<br>
I only ever draw because I want to, because it is significant to me.
<br>
what good is the art, even if noone sees it? The satisfaction and pride that
<br>
the artist feels.
<br>
Only one sort of art has a particular function to someone other than the
<br>
artist, that is architecture.
<br>
