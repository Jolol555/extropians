<p>There's an outfit in Los Alamitos (yet another LA suburb) that builds
<br>
copper etched-film laminate devices, mostly for active cooling of laser
<br>
diodes.  They built a combustion chamber for RotRock which I supervised
<br>
the testing of at 3000 lb thrust... I haven't heard any proposals for
<br>
making labyrinth cooling in silicon- if feasible it might be a good
<br>
improvement, and cheaper than attaching a separate copper heat
<br>
exchanger.  Liquid coolant would be superior to air, partly due to
<br>
better heat exchange, partly because the coolant could be kept cleaner
<br>
than air.
