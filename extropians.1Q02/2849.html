</em><br>
<em>&gt;First, I want to say your post is excellent, thanks for sharing, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glad you are still alive
</em><br>
<p>Thanks! me too :P
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If the individual is free of dependents and debts, then I entirely agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with you. I disagree, though, when it comes to dependents and debts, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state (or your PPL provider, in a libertarian setting) does have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interest in looking out for the interests of others who are dependent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upon you being a productive member of society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lets look at a hypothetical situation, lets say I am driving while high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and hit another car, causing damage to not only my car, but the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person's car and injuring them and my ex-wife and two kids who are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the back seat of my car, but my ex-wife has  just gained full custody of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them and I've lost all parental privileges and responsibilities. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unemployed and uninsured, and I say, &quot;I'm high and can't pay for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damages anyways cause I've got no job.&quot; I do happen to own a $200,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;house outright. If the state says &quot;huh, well, we're gonna seize your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;house and sell it to pay for the damage you did.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can I, the addict, STILL blame the state for taking my house? Is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the state did WRONG?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Furthermore, by seizing that last crutch in my life that was enabling my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addiction, namely having a decent place to live so I could kid myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I wasn't really at 'rock bottom' yet, so I &quot;wasn't ready&quot; to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sober, didn't the state (or the insurance company, or the courts, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever) help me along to decide to get sober, while protecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;EQUAL interests of others involved?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and don't say this is 'nonsense and inappropriate'. I've seen situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like this or exactly like this in the lives of many addicts.
</em><br>
<p><p>First I want to apologize if I sounded too dismissive (while not my 
<br>
intention, I now see that I kinda was) but I think it was more a reaction to 
<br>
the comment itself perhaps than your point behind it. Also understand, I am 
<br>
in early recovery, immersed in &quot;the program&quot; &amp; I'm just SO sick of listening 
<br>
to people whining &amp; feeling sorry for themselves without actually DOING 
<br>
anything about anything that I'm at a point now where I really have no 
<br>
compassion or sympathy. These are my own highly volatile personal feelings 
<br>
which I know should not interfere with a rational analysis of the matter at 
<br>
hand. So again, I'm really sorry. If you do have experience with addicts in 
<br>
early recovery, you should know that emotionally we're more fucked up than 
<br>
we were when we were using :P They say when you get sober you are the mental 
<br>
age (maturity I assume) of the age you *started using at. (can any 
<br>
neurological creedence be given to this claim?)
<br>
Anyhow, you pose a difficult question. But like you said, this is the real 
<br>
world, not an ideal state. My problem specifically is the whole government 
<br>
seizure of property thing. I think my general concerns are reflected by 
<br>
another post
<br>
<p>by Lee Daniel Crocker 12/2/02:
<br>
&lt;&lt;And further, while forfeiture cases may seem justified on 
<br>
criminaldrug-abuse grounds, the reality of the law and its present 
<br>
applicationis that they are simply government theft of private property 
<br>
without dueprocess. No conviction--or even formal accusation--of any crime 
<br>
isnecessary for a forfeiture. Due process and the rights of the accuseddon't 
<br>
apply, because no person is being accused: the property itself isbeing 
<br>
accused (the court cases have wonderful titles like &quot;U.S. vs. 100Bottles of 
<br>
Wine&quot;) Anyone who supports such forfeiture laws is nolibertarian, regardless 
<br>
of the pretext used to justify them.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I can't comment on the last part because I don't know anything about 
<br>
libertarian, but living in a State with the power to seize property is just 
<br>
plain scary. &amp; the truth is that this power is abused more often than we 
<br>
know. The best example of this is chronicled in a documentary by Robbie 
<br>
Leppzer called &quot;An Act of Conscience&quot; - its on the Sundance Channel 
<br>
sometimes if you get a chance to peep it. This couple refused to pay taxes 
<br>
during the eighties (because of the Iran-Contra stuff I think - I was too 
<br>
young to remember) but figured their taxes out every year w/ their 
<br>
accountant &amp; donated the money to local charities. Their house was seized &amp; 
<br>
they protested outside in tents for almost two years (since, through a 
<br>
technicality, they still owned the land the house was on). Its really an 
<br>
amazing story, from whatever your viewpoint. I think its also available 
<br>
through turningtide film. I only know about it because it all happened a 
<br>
town away from here (middle-of-nowhere-northwestern Massachusetts - and yes 
<br>
our street lights really are always green!)
