<p>Oh, I will. This was simply a public notice. Since I was informed of
<br>
hushmail by someone on the list when it was first starting up, I assume
<br>
that there is at least one person here who may know someone at the
<br>
company. I may be wrong, however, vbut this is simply one consumer
<br>
attempting to put out as big a signal to the market as possible.
