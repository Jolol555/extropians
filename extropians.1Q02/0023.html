<br>
<em>&gt; I'm pleased to report that China is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exemplifying -- in most respects -- an explosion of extropian values
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and they're really interested in nanotech.
<br>
Here's a news item about it:
<br>
<p>CHINA, EMBOLDENED BY BREAKTHROUGHS,
<br>
SETS OUT TO BECOME NANOTECH POWER
<br>
<a href="http://www.smalltimes.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=2736">http://www.smalltimes.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=2736</a>
<br>
In laboratories across China, researchers at universities are intensely
<br>
studying the potential of nanotubes and nanowires - some reporting
<br>
breakthroughs that have escaped the West. The scientists, most of whom have
<br>
interdisciplinary backgrounds in chemistry, physics and engineering, are first
<br>
seeing how far they can stretch their imaginations before they translate their
<br>
discoveries into practical applications. China plans to intensify research in
<br>
the field, aiming to prove that the country has the potential to become a
<br>
powerhouse in nanotechnology.
<br>
Chinese scientists at Beijing's Tsinghua University announced last month that
<br>
they have significantly increased the rate at which carbon nanotubes can be
<br>
produced. The scientists say they have developed a new approach that produces
<br>
carbon nanotubes 15 kilograms per hour, 60 times faster than the speed at
<br>
which scientists had been producing them.
<br>
About a year ago, scientists at the Hong Kong University of Science and
<br>
Technology created the world's smallest single-walled carbon nanotube, with a
<br>
diameter of 0.4 nanometers.
<br>
A few years ago, Hong Kong's City University began experimenting with silicon
<br>
nanowires and in 1998 they patented their own oxide-assisted growth method, a
<br>
technique that can grow the material in bulk quantities.
<br>
The Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at the Chinese Academy of
<br>
Sciences in Beijing opened last year. The center joins more than a dozen
<br>
institutes and universities in the hinterlands of China to collaborate on
<br>
research.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
