<em>&gt; &gt; Whilst the finer details of Dr. J's paper have been gone over here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm glad to see that the &quot;middle&quot; ground, guy-on-the-street aspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of Transhumanism is being addressed.  &quot;Democratic&quot; is a word most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people relate positively to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That in itself is a very different issue.  The points of the paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we addressed where the negatively planted commentary which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both inaccurate and subjective.  Thus, James could have said reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such points he makes as &quot;In my opinion ...&quot; or &quot;It seems to me ...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>It is also important to determine what James means by 'democratic'. He
<br>
seems to be purposefully vague in this respect, specificially because in
<br>
the details of his writing, it seems that his primary emphasis is on
<br>
'economic democracy' and not political democracy. This is the sort of
<br>
demogogic revisionism of the terms of debate I've warned of in the past.
<br>
&quot;Economic Democracy&quot;, is, of course, socialism and communism, political
<br>
philosophies which have historically been highly intolerant of dissent,
<br>
diversity, and individual self determination in economic matters as well
<br>
as political ones.
<br>
<p>For this reason, economic democracy is highly anti-extropic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, here issue is not just politics, but authenticity.  In that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we cannot label any transhumanist group with a political lean unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and until such group makes a declaration of such.  The bigger issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here is pitting one group against another by inference. Is such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference is weak then the premise needs to be addressed.
</em><br>
<p>And I am glad that so many members of the WTA have expressed opposition
<br>
to the statements in James' paper. The problem is, of course, that being
<br>
the acting Chairman, any statement made by him will tend to carry the
<br>
weight of a policy statement of the group. That his personal beliefs are
<br>
so demonstrably anti-extropic should concern all WTA members, given
<br>
their stated beliefs in personal self determination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I think of the politics of transhumanism, I think of a future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oriented sensibility, not based on 20th Century political dogma.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the basic understanding of transhumanism is a better world for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humankind, it would be paradoxical not to enrich a transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical outlook with a positive intention for &quot;people on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; street&quot;, if they are willing and wanting.   And even if they are not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly a banner of welcoming of humanity exists within this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentiment.
</em><br>
<p>The difficulty is that the 'people on the street' do not communicate or
<br>
think generally with a future oriented sensibility, they are locked in
<br>
the here and now, and generally living by the 20th century dogma they
<br>
inherited or developed earlier in life. One thing I've found in my
<br>
political work is that you have to communicate your views in terms as
<br>
understood by the mainstream in order for them to come across and reach
<br>
a listening audience.
<br>
<p>For example, it is fruitless for a libertarian to call themselves a
<br>
'classical liberal', because the target audience hears &quot;liberal&quot; and
<br>
automatically concludes either a)&quot;ah, big government, egalitarian aimed
<br>
big brother regulation, and overbearing tax levels, with minimal public
<br>
accountability&quot;, or b) &quot;ah, more money in my
<br>
welfare/disability/retirement/other entitlement check, and more support
<br>
for my buddies at the union to squeeze management dry, more hiring
<br>
'affirmative action' quotas and no right wingers messin' with the school
<br>
system&quot;, depending on the particular point of view of the 'person on the
<br>
street'.
<br>
<p>Similarly, talk of 'upgrading' people, or perfecting ones genes is
<br>
similarly scary to people. Instead, talk of a 'right to be healthy',
<br>
free of 'defects' like old age, deafness, blindness (as well as poor
<br>
hearing and poor eyesight).
<br>
<p>As to James' statement, it is obvious that he is being disengenuous when
<br>
he speaks of being for 'democracy', a term, as understood by the person
<br>
on the street being political democracy, which is in contradiction to
<br>
his actual meaning, being economic democracy or socialism. This
<br>
intentional vagueness is the mark of a demogogue. He's not literally
<br>
lying, but he is speaking in such a way that his intent and your
<br>
understanding are in conflict.
