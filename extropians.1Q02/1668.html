</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do the genes that create a propensity for alchoholism also enable your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, subconcioussly of course, to A) recognize an alchoholic beverage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B)reach a hand out and grasp it C) bring it toward your mouth D)swallow
</em><br>
it?
<br>
<em>&gt; Or, at some point in time, are you concioussly aware of these things going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on.  Even being an alchoholic, even being born with the genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predisposition to alchoholism (which is more a genetic predisposition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addictive behavior) you can still CHOOSE to not drink, its as simple as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<p>No, not necessarily. Not if you are in delirium or dementia or you are nine
<br>
years old and a 'tramp' offers you an
<br>
'orange-juice-do-you-want-to-buy-some-more'. And not if your every moment
<br>
without that alcohol feels so terrible that you would prefer suicide to
<br>
having to feel it one moment longer.
<br>
We can 'give up' pain killers, but if the resulting pain is worse than the
<br>
effects of the 'medicine', where do we go from there?
<br>
I'm not referring to 'withdrawal symptoms'. I'm referring to the ongoing and
<br>
uncured 'symptoms' that led the person to start drinking in the first place.
<br>
Why do people feel a need to get drunk / stoned / high / whatever?  Isn't it
<br>
because their state of mind when straight is not as nice as perhaps they
<br>
feel it should be? Because feeling high feels more 'natural' than our
<br>
ordinary stressed-out states?
<br>
I think people who are alcoholic and who carry on drinking are making this
<br>
kind of choice subconsciously...Do I have another drink and trash my
<br>
liver...or do I tolerate the horrible way I feel when sober and die of
<br>
stomach ulcers and a coronary instead?
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rats, when in stressed confined
<br>
<em>&gt; situations can resort to cannibalism.  Does that mean people will too?
</em><br>
<p>Yup. Trapped in an elevator with six of you guys and no food for long
<br>
enough, I would most definitely eat you.
<br>
<p>{snip}
<br>
<em>&gt; Primates exhibit what is known as the 'Elevator effect' when in stressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confined conditions.  They are all calm and polite to one another, which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprisingly enough, is how human's behave as well.  Just cause a Rat does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something, does not mean a person will.
</em><br>
<p>No, indeed. ...But they might...(see above)
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Now someone with the proclivity to tolerate alcohol can develop a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependance on the substance, in fact only people with a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic proclivity can. If someone with this proclivity does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop a dependance then they have to make a conscious moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision to stop. There is considerable evidence that once a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependance developes the individual remains sensitive to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependancy. I suspect a physiological change.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      -------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is also considerable evidence that if someone, no matter how
</em><br>
addicted
<br>
<em>&gt; to something, chooses to stop doing it, he (or she) can.  That evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being the multitude of people who have stopped doing something they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addicted to doing by just deciding that they no longer want to do it.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can, after all 'decide' to stop eating.
</em><br>
<p>It's an equation; or a formula...pain versus gain. It has to be constantly
<br>
re-calculated and updated in real time, for me, moment to moment. Just like
<br>
people add up calories. If I continue to feel happy and fulfilled whilst
<br>
straight, I will never take another drug. If I feel bad, I'll try to find
<br>
the least damaging way to change that. My intelligence will work towards
<br>
keeping my mind sane, even if it costs this body.
<br>
What thinkest thou?
