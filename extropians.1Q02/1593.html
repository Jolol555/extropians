<br>
<p>Well actually the paper misquoted me. I am the youngest, &quot;most active&quot;
<br>
atheist activist there is. There are no other atheists younger than me more
<br>
active than myself. I started Atheists of Denver which hold 180 members,
<br>
Freethought Radio which may become one of the largest radio stations on the
<br>
planet, Freethinkers &amp; Atheists of Virginia which we're expecting to fill
<br>
the house, &amp; in September I will be hosting my first National Convention in
<br>
Virginia Beach which will attract thousands of tourists during labor day
<br>
weekend. Not to mention I'm starting a Freethought Coalition designed to
<br>
fight the Christian Coalition head to head toe to toe on political and
<br>
advertising grounds.
<br>
<p>But as you said...who cares?

</em><br>
<em>&gt;This article was printed in Portfolio Weekly (January 22nd issue) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;written by D.D. Delaney.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I Want To Disbelieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PAT ROBERTSON, take note. A young man has come to Virginia Beach with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mission to make the world safe for atheists and free-thinking secular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humanists, and his organizational model is the Christian Coalition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Clint O'Dell is just getting started, but, like Pat before him, he hopes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;go far. He has a vision of a global Atheist Coalition, with its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broadcasting system, charities, and a political agenda to defeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faith-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legislative initiatives and elect atheists to high office.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Describing himself, at 23, as &quot;the youngest atheist activist there is,&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There are younger--Micah White, for instance....but who cares?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;O'Dell believes there is an atheist awakening dawning in America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm hoping to pick up (that) slow-moving ball,&quot; he says, &quot;put it in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannon, strike a match, and set off that cannon.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That is going to be MIGHTY slow mover...but we ahve to start somewhere.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In partnership with like-minded Lauren Floyd of Chesapeake, he has put out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call for all doubters, skeptics, and non-believers to attend the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meeting of Freethinkers and Atheists of Virginia on Sunday, Jan. 27, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1-3 p.m. in the auditorium of the Virginia Beach Central Library.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The organization's purpose, O'Dell says, is to achieve legitimacy for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atheism and &quot;to promote secular values.&quot; Membership is open to &quot;anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is for helping to make America become more secular.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We have no idea&quot; how many people might turn out for the first meeting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Floyd, who, at 43, is O'Dell's senior partner in the start-up. &quot;Getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atheists to join a group is kind of like trying to herd cats. They're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;typically individualists, suspicious of any organized group.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Atheists have been the subject iof a few studies; one recent one said that
<br>
atheists were by nature less dependent on other people. So therefore they
<br>
are not joiners; therefore they do not organize....
