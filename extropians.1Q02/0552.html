<p>
Transhumanism is, in my view, an easily abusable philosophy, because it can 
<br>
be adapted to most political views with relatively little effort.
<br>
<p>What I mean is that, despite the encomiable efforts of many transhumanists 
<br>
authors and philosophers, it can be boiled down to the drive to overcome the 
<br>
human condition by becoming post-human, discarding virtually everything else 
<br>
(including the humanist part). This could allow a person of virtually any 
<br>
political conviction (Nazis included, but, I guess, luddists excluded) to 
<br>
adopt-and-adapt it to his or her own views and goals.
<br>
<p>The same can not be said of Extropy, because Extropy is what you get when 
<br>
libertarians adopt-and-adapt transhumanism (the fact that they, rather than, 
<br>
say, the socialdemocrats or the nazis were the first to do so speaks 
<br>
volumes, but that's another story...)
<br>
<p>This early start still gives extropians (i.e. spontaneous 
<br>
order/libertartarian transhumanists) a clear advantage on any other 
<br>
organised political transhumanist movement (there aren't any!), *but that 
<br>
will inevitably change as transhumanist memes go mainstream*.
<br>
<p>A few years from now, transhumanism could be taken for granted (apart for a 
<br>
few extreme fringe groups) in the same way that today everybody takes 
<br>
liberal democracy for granted (apart for a few extreme fringe groups).
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
