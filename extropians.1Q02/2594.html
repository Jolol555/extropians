<p>
Just a thought (to get back to extropian matters): suppose drivers could
<br>
affect lights through some technological means. Would there be any
<br>
system that would make the traffic throughput more efficient than the
<br>
current timer-based lights?
<br>
<p>Suppose each car could &quot;vote&quot; for the light (similarly for the
<br>
pedestrians at crossings). At a crossing this would likely mean that the
<br>
biggest queue would get green first, and decrease until the votes of the
<br>
other queue weighed over. With a bit of inertia in the system this would
<br>
likely ensure a fair division. There is likely a bit of need for
<br>
weighing votes by the time the light has been red too, in order to ensue
<br>
that cars crossing a very busy street along a far less busy street ever
<br>
will get past. At night, when there are few cars at all, all lights
<br>
would turn green since there are just single votes. 
<br>
<p>However, traffic flow theory is filled with surprises and paradoxes, so
<br>
I wouldn't be surprised if there are conditions where this kind of
<br>
solution wouldn't be optimal. Any thoughts?
