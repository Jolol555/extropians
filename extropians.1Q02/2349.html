<em>&gt;Can you prove otherwise? Government has always operated more as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hindrance to individuals attaining wealth than a help. How, in fact, did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government give Bill Gates $60 billion? How has it given Harvey, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brent, or any other successful extropian their wealth. Every one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will demonstrate how they worked their butts off for it.
</em><br>
<p>Tell me, without a central government, how would America have won the second
<br>
world war?  Retained it's position as a leader of global trade that has
<br>
allowed the massive economic growth of the 20th century?  Avoided a violent
<br>
revolution that could have displaced our elected government with a
<br>
repressive totalitarian regime?  No, Bill Gates did not get $60 Billion
<br>
handed to him by the US Government- it was the fact that we have a stable
<br>
social order and economy that allowed him to earn $60 Billion, which would
<br>
have been impossible under anarchy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You apparently don't know much about the US. Its actually quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pastiche of systems from state to state, although the last half century
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has imposed a federal blanket of socialist confiscation upon everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's tax system is rigged so that you either surrender any margin that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would serve to make you wealthy, or you have to become a tax criminal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;escape wage slavery.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Are we living in the same country, under the same tax system?
<br>
Although I pay little to nothing in taxes as a college student, I can tell
<br>
you that if the federal income tax was eliminated tomorrow, it wouldn't
<br>
change my family's lifestyle one bit (even though it would mean my father
<br>
would take home approximately $150,000 more per year).  Those of us with
<br>
little to no real income are unaffected by the government's &quot;blanket of
<br>
socialist confiscation&quot;- and those who complain the most vocally about it
<br>
typically have more income than they truly need.  Frankly, I don't mind it
<br>
one bit.
