----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Hakim%20Bey%20(was:%20RE:%20virtual%20nation%20building)">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the extropian vision of the future is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viable it cannot depend on &quot;machine evolution&quot; alone to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realization. But unless anarcho-futurism can develop a critique of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology, it is relegated precisely to this passive role.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which I also agree with. We will not get to transhumanity just by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inventing the right tools, we have to change ourselves and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think I must be missing something here because this seems either trivial
<br>
or question-begging. It is trivial if you mean that if we invent the right
<br>
tools but don't change ourselves then we have not reached transhumanity.
<br>
This seems trivial given that changing ourselves is a necessary condition
<br>
for transhumanity. But of course the point of &quot;machine evolution&quot; or
<br>
evolution through genetic engineering is to change ourselves. Furthermore,
<br>
this seems to beg the question of our relation to &quot;machine evolution&quot;--if
<br>
they are our mind children then haven't 'We' changed?
<br>
Also I don't find this essay or your commentary enlightening on the HARD
<br>
question of transhumanist ethics, namely, our obligations now to institute
<br>
the appropriate ethical/social/political seed stock for the posthuman
<br>
revolution. I take it that you think that we do have such an obligation and
<br>
thus count you among the 'cultural activists'--those that think that we
<br>
should be doing all we can along these lines to ensure the future proceeds
<br>
in the right ethical direction. The cultural passivists believe that there
<br>
is little point in trying to set up the seed stock since the posthumanity
<br>
rupture will be so complete that our efforts will have little bearing on
<br>
subsequent events. It does not follow, as Bey says, that without this
<br>
cultural critique the cultural passivists are consigned to a passive role.
<br>
Applying technology to humans might provide the cultural passivists with all
<br>
the &quot;critique&quot; they need. Ultimately the essay works on the wrong unit of
<br>
analysis to be persuasive. The Marx/Heideggerian understanding of technology
<br>
being intimately associated with Humanity's self-identity is a
<br>
socio-historical thesis. The cultural passivists can easily accept this
<br>
thesis but say that it is irrelevant. Imagine preparing a bunch of monkey's
<br>
for their postmonkey state--our intention is to genetically alter them to
<br>
bring them up to human cogntive capacity. Is the first step to try to
<br>
fine-tune their culture (Cf. The Evolution of Culture in Animals, Bonner)?
<br>
Presumably the cultural passivists would say that all such efforts are
<br>
wasted given that the monkies will emerge into an entirely new cultural
<br>
&quot;ecological niche&quot;. Similarly, fine-tuning our culture now might seem like a
<br>
waste of time and perhaps even a distraction from the more important goal of
<br>
advancing technology. The proper unit of analysis, then, might be something
<br>
like biological evolution, e.g., the emergence of the Hominid line from
<br>
Australopethicine.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  count among the cultural activists, but not because without a
<br>
cultural critique we must be resigned to &quot;a passive role&quot;. My reasoning is
<br>
more pragmatic and less Heideggerian. Think of it in terms of a sort of
<br>
Pascalian wager. If we attempt to fine-tune our culture and the posthuman
<br>
breach is so vast that our efforts were in vain then little is lost. If we
<br>
attempt to fine-tune our culture and it has positive influence on the
<br>
posthuman future then all is gained. If we are passive and our efforts would
<br>
have had a positive influence on future events then all is lost. If we are
<br>
passive and our efforts would have had no effect then little is gained
<br>
(perhaps watching a little more tv, etc.).
<br>
