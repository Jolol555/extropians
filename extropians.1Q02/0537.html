<p>I don't know the proportions and I'm not terribly interested in how many 
<br>
are willing to apply particular labels to themselves. However, I *have* 
<br>
noticed that amongst the hard line libertarian voices, there are a growing 
<br>
number of less committed views. These (like mine) may frequently sound 
<br>
libertarian, but are more pragmatic and more interested in results than in 
<br>
clinging to any particular ideology for the sake of &quot;consistency&quot; or 
<br>
ideological purity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Its not that I don't want to hear from

<p>This is certainly reasonable, and I have to agree that Mike Lorrey's 
<br>
pinning on you of a bolshevik label strikes me as entirely inappropriate. 
<br>
His equation of &quot;social democratic&quot; with &quot;bolshevik&quot; is mistaken in any 
<br>
case. &quot;Menshevik&quot; would be more consistent, though still not the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But far more important than the potential troublemaking of these Volks is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fact the majority of people (unfairly and irrationally) hear Nazi
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;transcending limitations through technology.
</em><br>
<p>This morning I did an interview with one of the major German newspapers. 
<br>
This is, so far as I can recall, the first time that I've talked with a 
<br>
German media representative or audience without the Nazi question coming up 
<br>
in some form. Perhaps it was the emphasis I put on the ideas all the way 
<br>
through, but I was still pleasantly surprised.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You, and Nick Bostrom BTW, assert that Nazi transhumanism is an oxymoron.
</em><br>
<p>Since I seem to be agreeing with you for a change, I must note that I agree 
<br>
on this point also. I think Nick defines transhumanism so that it is 
<br>
intrinsically incompatible with racism or fascism or Nazism. I think it is 
<br>
reasonable to make such a case, based on our humanist roots. But all things 
<br>
considered, I would allow that there can be these forms of transhumanism. 
<br>
Of course you cannot be an extropian and hold such views, since that would 
<br>
conflict with the Extropian Principles. The Extropian philosophy is 
<br>
transhumanism seen from a perspective that excludes those memetic niches.
