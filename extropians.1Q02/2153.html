<em>&gt; &gt; This thread now concludes, the two former disputants having

<em>&gt; That's because you and I realize that we are not really combatants

</em><br>
<p>Or, we could have unconsciously faked agreeability in order to convince
<br>
social observers that we are good Hansonian meta-rationalists.
<br>
<p>To take an extreme case, suppose that I argue with you, and your opinion
<br>
converges to mine, but mine does not change.  It follows that you
<br>
(although not I) will appear to be meta-rational, and that I will appear
<br>
to be rational but not necessarily meta-rational - the underlying
<br>
assumption being that I had good facts, and that you had the ability to
<br>
adjust your opinion based on the facts, and that this resulted in the
<br>
observed outcome, convergence of your opinion to mine.  If anyone else
<br>
later disagrees with you on a different issue, you are probably right;
<br>
after all, you have demonstrated the ability to adjust opinions based on
<br>
new information, and the opposing party has not yet done so.  Since the
<br>
quality of someone's database has heterogenous causation and is hence
<br>
likely to vary more than their meta-rationality, demonstrating
<br>
meta-rationality raises total credibility more than winning any single
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p>By demonstrating the ability to &quot;lose&quot; an argument where the case
<br>
warrants, one greatly strengthens the Bayesian signal of claiming to be
<br>
winning.  It follows that losing an argument in front of an audience of
<br>
meta-rationalists can operate to raise your credibility, and that, in an
<br>
odd way, losing an argument can even be a way of boasting about your own
<br>
meta-rationality.  Thus when wrapping up the argument, I should probably
<br>
have written that I observed your opinion to change without claiming that
<br>
my opinion changed, since the latter is &quot;boasting&quot; about my own
<br>
meta-rationality, and should be stated by a third party in order to be
<br>
credible.  On the other hand, if I claim that your opinion changed without
<br>
also &quot;conceding&quot; that mine changed, I may appear to non-meta-rationalists
<br>
to be claiming to have &quot;won&quot; the argument, which would of course be a
<br>
childishly immature way to respond to someone else demonstrating
<br>
meta-rationality.  An interesting dilemna in public relations.
