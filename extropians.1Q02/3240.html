Forwarded from...somewhere:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Dear Sci Cryonics,
<br>
&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Oh, yeah--sci.cryonics...
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am writing as I am very keen to hear from anyone who is 22-34 yrs
<br>
old and who is interested in cryonics for an exciting new documentary
<br>
series that we are making for the BBC about the 22-34 generation.
<br>
<p>'Born in the 70s' is an in-depth exploration of what British twenty
<br>
and early thirty-somethings really get up to… What do we eat, think,
<br>
smoke and say?  Who do we sleep with, where, when, how often and for
<br>
just how long? How happy are we with what we've got and how hard do we
<br>
work to change it? How do we feel about death and what are we most
<br>
passionate about?
<br>
<p>Starting from a brand new, comprehensive survey conducted throughout
<br>
Britain, 'Born in the 70s' is filled with personal stories not only
<br>
from the seemingly ordinary people who conform to every average, but
<br>
also from the extraordinary people whose quirky extremes help to shape
<br>
the attitudes and aspirations of this generation. It is guaranteed to
<br>
get the audience talking, and as one of the first high profile
<br>
programmes for the BBC's newest channel - BBC 3, 'Born in the 70s'
<br>
will have a media impact that reaches far beyond the screen.
<br>
<p>These fascinating revelations will be brought to life using the kind
<br>
of computer generated effects that made 'The Human Body' and 'Walking
<br>
with Dinosaurs' such compelling TV. We are going to create the average
<br>
face, hear the average voice and visit the average bedroom of young
<br>
Britain. Then we'll scour the country to find and crown a real life Mr
<br>
and Mrs Average UK 2002. From friendships to fashions and sex lives to
<br>
spending sprees, from the stuff we put into our bodies to the things
<br>
that come out, 'Born in the 70s' is a ground breaking and ambitious
<br>
new TV series, creating the first ever Doomsday book for the MTV
<br>
generation.
<br>
<p>This ten part series of half hour programmes will take a fresh look at
<br>
our homes, offices, relationships, health, values, sex lives, friends,
<br>
bodies as well as the way we feel about our looks and where and how we
<br>
like to go clubbing – and we are looking for as many people possible
<br>
to get involved.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned, I would be delighted if you were to consider helping
<br>
us with the programme that we are making about health as we are very
<br>
keen to talk to someone between 22-34yrs old who is interested in
<br>
cryonics – for a section within the programme that looks at death and
<br>
our attitudes towards death. The story would be filmed from the
<br>
contributor's pespective.
<br>
<p>Please do not hesitate to give me a ring at the office on my direct
<br>
line 0207 284 8187 (or through the switchboard on 0207 284 8181) or by
<br>

<br>
<p>if I can be of any further assistance.
<br>
<p>Many thanks for your kind consideration in this matter,
<br>
<p>Yours sincerely,
<br>
<p>Louisa Rowland,
<br>
Associate Producer
<br>
‘Born in the 70s'
