<p>I think that's very good news to inform the public about the pros of
<br>
cloning!

New pig clones born
<br>
<p>A biopharmaceutical company that helped clone Dolly the Sheep has produced
<br>
new cloned pigs.
<br>
<p>PPL Therapeutics says the pigs, which partially lack a specific gene, are a
<br>
major step towards using animal organs for human transplants.
<br>
<p>The female piglets were born on Christmas Day in the United States.
<br>
<p>They have been named Noel, Angel, Star, Joy and Mary.
<br>
<p>The pigs are not the first to be cloned.
<br>
<p>But PPL, a commercial offshoot of the Roslin Institute in Scotland, says the
<br>
pigs are the first to be engineered in a way that should prevent their
<br>
tissues being rejected by the human body.
<br>
<p>The animals' biological make-up is slightly different from ordinary pigs.
<br>
<p>'Near term' solution
<br>
<p>A specific gene, which makes the human body reject pig organs, has been
<br>
knocked out.
<br>
<p>PPL says that it intends to use the pigs as part of its programme to seek a
<br>
cure for humans suffering from diabetes.
<br>
<p>Dr David Ayares, Vice-President of Research at PPL's US division said the
<br>
birth of the pigs was a critical milestone in the company's xenograft
<br>
programme.
<br>
<p>&quot;This advance provides a near term solution for overcoming the shortage of
<br>
human organs for transplants as well as insulin-producing cells to cure
<br>
diabetes,&quot; Dr Ayares said in a statement.
<br>
<p>The news was given a cautious welcome by the Society, Religion and
<br>
Technology Project of the Church of Scotland.
<br>
<p>Safety concerns
<br>
<p>Dr Donald Bruce said the disabling of a gene that would otherwise cause the
<br>
rejection of a pig organ by the human body might, potentially, be ethically
<br>
acceptable in the context of xenotransplantation but only if a number of
<br>
conditions were fulfilled.
<br>
<p>&quot;The prospect of using pig organs to save many human lives, or to improve
<br>
substantially the quality of life of dialysis patients or diabetics, is
<br>
attractive from the viewpoint of human medicine,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;But it raises serious ethical issues over the use of animals and a major
<br>
question of safety.&quot;
<br>
<p>PPL was the first to clone pigs in spring 2000. In April 2001, PPL said that
<br>
it had produced gene-altered, or transgenic, pig clones.
<br>
<p>The pigs had had a foreign gene added to the cells from which they were
<br>
developed.
<br>
<p>A month later an Australian company, BresaGen Ltd, said it had also produced
<br>
a cloned pig using a different technology.
<br>
<p><p>Potential obstacles
<br>
<p>Pigs are thought to be the most suitable animals for providing organs for
<br>
transplant into humans.
<br>
<p>A pig's heart is about the same size and has about the same power output as
<br>
a human heart.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, scientists understand the steps they need to take to
<br>
genetically modify pig tissue so that it will not be rejected by the human
<br>
immune system.
<br>
<p>However, there are a number of major problems to be overcome.
<br>
<p>They include the theoretical risk that pig viruses might jump into humans
<br>
and cause new diseases.
