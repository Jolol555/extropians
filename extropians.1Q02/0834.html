<em>&gt;&gt;Programming. What's the 'big software project blowout's' overall solution

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;anything_. There goes computer programming as a profession (I include myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in this profession!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, let's see...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI can take a self-consistent set of requirements and turn them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running code?  Show me the CEO or marketer who can give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-consistent set of requirements, *especially* in commitee.  (Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ok, they do exist, but they're rare.)  Transition to translator, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ex-coder still has job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I can't resist responding to this.  It is the bane of my 
<br>
existence as a software architect that too much &quot;architecture&quot; 
<br>
of new systems today is done by marketeers and CEOs and various 
<br>
levels of managers who generally wouldn't know good computer 
<br>
architecture if it bit them.  Committees do not produce coherent 
<br>
graceful systems either.  At best committees and the marketeers 
<br>
and CEOs add to and help refine requirements.  The should never 
<br>
be seriously involved in analysis/design/implementation except 
<br>
to track whether the requirements are fulfilled and to arrange 
<br>
for prototype/feedback with end-users (from an organizational 
<br>
perspective, not coding/design).
<br>
<p>It is not the programming itself that is the tricky part.  It is 
<br>
the architecture/design and the continuous refinement of that 
<br>
design from multiple perspectives that is really tricky and 
<br>
often simply and surprisingly NOT DONE.  It is also the most 
<br>
difficult to automate.  You can automate a lot of tools that 
<br>
allow the architect/designer[s] to do this level of work more 
<br>
cleanly and without getting caught in too many low-level details 
<br>
but it is not clear that you can remove humans from this loop 
<br>
entirely as long as the software is for use by humans and is in 
<br>
any way maintained by humans.  What an AI, an early one at any 
<br>
rate, could be very good at is choosing  existing design 
<br>
components and balancing them against a set of requirements and 
<br>
producing new localized components.  It will take a much more 
<br>
sophisticated AI to orchestrate the creation of entire libraries 
<br>
of new components and useful abstractions for problem classes. 
<br>
It would be extremely interesting to attempt to design such a thing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; AI can also translate from vague, incoherent requirements into running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code, including the inevitable arguing back and forth to nail the specs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down enough?  &quot;Hey, AI I just rented: hack into various corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks' financial programs and score me a nest egg to retire on.  Make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure no one, except maybe you and/or I, can trace the hack or anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to it back to you and/or I.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Piece of cake.  :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ok, that's a gimme, and it'd only last until the AIs taking over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate networks finally implement adequate security.  Where next for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ex-coders not lucky enough to get a job working on these ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving AIs?  Tinker with the AI a bit and, &quot;Hey, AI: find me a job.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ^_^;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Ultimately I hope every software engineer out there has a dream 
<br>
of automating more and more of what they do.  And I hope we 
<br>
organize our society and economy in such a way that doing so is 
<br>
not suicidal, and more to the point, is the ultimate win.  If I 
<br>
am protecting my ass by not creating such a system then frankly 
<br>
I might as well retire right now.  I can't work like that. 
<br>
Creating such a system is actually darned difficult.  Look at 
<br>
our so-called tools today and how difficult it is to build a 
<br>
good business plan for a company to advance those, much less to 
<br>
replace programmers and then tell me it is likely to come about 
<br>
any time soon.  Go have a look at the software CAD tools and 
<br>
development environments.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;I just hope that the speed of the change is moderated so that people are OK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Sometimes I have nightmare visions of being ostracised at the local market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and having people throw rocks at my house out of the fear of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;(potentially) very smart little grey box in my office.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I'm ever in that situation (which implies moving away from an area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where many residents would have a similar box), I'd probably also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich enough to buy the local police and have the rock-throwers arrested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; en masse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>That isn't the point though, is it?  The point is how to make 
<br>
expanding technology including AI enough of a boon to everyone 
<br>
that it is not seen as so threatening as to lead to violence 
<br>
possibly escalating into great danger to developers and even to 
<br>
wars which would slow down the advancement we seek.  It is a 
<br>
very important issue.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;Attention, oppressed masses of the Muslim world.  What do you say we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beat the infidels at their own game?  Lo, they have thought of a way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring Allah's wisdom to the masses.  See how they tremble in fear when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they contemplate its potential existence.  Let us bring their nightmare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to life, and in so doing, bring about our new golden age.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>There are actually &quot;whiter&quot; versions of this that could be very 
<br>
important in getting to the Singularity relatively peaceably and 
<br>
in one piece.
