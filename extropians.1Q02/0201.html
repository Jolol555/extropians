<em>&gt;From: Neil Blanch &lt;<a href="mailto:neilb@nswcc.org.au?Subject=Re:%20some%20US%20observations%20&amp;%20notes">neilb@nswcc.org.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Brian, I can think of a few reasons why Chicago's crime situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is so bad.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;1.Whilst the availability of guns in Chicago has become more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult, it is no difficulty for a determined individual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particularly a criminal, to simply cross state lines &amp; purchase a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gun in a state with more lax ownership &amp; sales restrictions. Gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restrictions will only really work if they are applied on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;federal (or better yet international) level. Piece-meal approaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to gun restriction only seem to favour those who will use such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weapons for nefarious purposes. 
</em><br>
<p>Dupage county, right next to Chicago's Cook county has few gun laws
<br>
and many gun stores yet has a tiny fraction of the crime.
<br>
<p>Guns don't kill people, people kill people. The reason certain
<br>
neighborhoods in Chicago have a lot of crime is because they have
<br>
a lot of criminals.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;2.The current US system of plea-bargaining seems to favour the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more hardened criminal. Example: a street level dealer (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;runner&quot;) is arrested. It is highly unlikely that he will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worthwhile information on his superiors &amp; it is unlikely that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be able to effect much change in his charges by plea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bargaining. Someone higher up the chain is arrested &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they have more details on the overall supply system, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can effectively plea bargain a more serious supply charge away in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exchange for that information. This is one of the reasons that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;majority of people in jail for drug offences (for example) are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for relatively minor offences (mandatory &quot;3 strikes&quot; sentencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't help much either), &amp; the big sharks are still out in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;community, doing maximum harm. 
</em><br>
<p>Except that this plea bargaining is most prevalent where there is
<br>
only a single perpetrator involved.
<br>
<p>No, the actual answer is that our current system is run under the
<br>
assumption that people are bad because of the environment, and
<br>
therefore it is wrong to hold them accountable for their own
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p>A ridiculous notion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I cannot claim to know what the best solution to the guns/crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem in the US. The issues involved are difficult, the pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from various interest groups so intense &amp; the size of the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so large, that no easy solution presents itself. To my mind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gun availability issue plays a major role in the problems that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US faces, however it is only one of many issues that will need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be addressed if the US is to curb the horrific rate of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crime that afflicts the majority of the united states. 
</em><br>
<p>We don't have a gun problem, we have an ethical problem with
<br>
insisting people are responsible for their own behavior.
<br>
<p><p>1) Hold people accountable for their own behavior
<br>
<p>2) lock up criminals
<br>
<p>3) Don't lock up people who aren't criminals (drug users)
<br>
<p>4) Try not to create new criminals.
<br>
<p>Next problem...
