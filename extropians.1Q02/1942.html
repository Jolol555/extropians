<em>&gt; Ayn Rand covered this topic rather well, I thought, and I would have assumed that as astute a group as extropians would surely have absorbed at least the basics of Rand's thought with their mother's milk.

<em>&gt; Briefly, the question &quot;what is the purpose of life,&quot; contains an error of category.  Things only HAVE purposes TO living entities.  Purpose to WHOM and FOR WHAT????  Purpose only has meaning with regard to a living entity.  To ask then - what is the pur
</em><br>
pose of LIFE? - is meaningless.  LIFE creates and identifies purposes.  (This does not mean, however, that all purposes are equally valid.  Life itself - and each living entity - has a specific identity.)
<br>
<p>Well, some living entities have purposes to other living entities:
<br>
domesticated plants and animals, for instance. Some species of insects
<br>
entire purpose is to serve other insect species, and could not survive
<br>
outside of their dens (see how ants domesticate other species).
<br>
<p>Similarly, there is a particular subgroup of human beings who can only
<br>
find purpose in being the purposes of others: preists and their
<br>
believers, politicians and their syncophants, officers and their
<br>
soldiers, any sort of social structure that utilizes a patron/client
<br>
relationship.
<br>
<p>Then if we look at the question from a metaversal standpoint (sorry, I
<br>
just saw Existenz and The 13th Floor for the first time last night, so
<br>
bear with me), if one is to accept the Bostrom Conjecture, then all
<br>
living beings' purpose is to serve as a functional problem solving
<br>
algorithm for the system operators who exist in the higher order
<br>
universe, and so on up to Universe Prime, or U-Prime as I call it.
<br>
<p>This is a carry-over from the old school of theological metaphysics,
<br>
which assumes that all of creation is the terrarium of some creator
<br>
being (name s/h/it as you please), or in the Singulatarian world view,
<br>
we are all just iterations of Eliezer ;).
<br>
<p>Now, to the rugged individualist, who denies any such higher purposes
<br>
except possibly the blind selfishness of their individual genes, they
<br>
can continue on their own individual paths, oblivious. They are still
<br>
serving the higher purpose in following their own life algorithm.
<br>
<p>Now, the lack of a real explaination for the Fermi Paradox is a
<br>
significant boost for the Bostromian cause, as it suggests that the
<br>
universe is actually far younger than astronomical observation would
<br>
suggest, that the simulation we are in only began when humanity evolved
<br>
the capacity to receive interface signals from the higher order
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>A means of partially disproving this would be to go and prove the most
<br>
reasonable answer for the Fermi Paradox, that transcendant civilizations
<br>
are among us as encrypted nanomachinery in the dust and dirt. 
<br>
<p>Another avenue to track on is in particle physics. Current theories and
<br>
observed fact indicate that the universe is certainly quite a digital
<br>
entity, where the bit level is manifested in the form of the quark. Are
<br>
there further particles within the quark, and within them as well, or is
<br>
the quark the bottom turtle in the pile. In theory, reaching a level of
<br>
quantum computation should allow us to hack the universe, and ask the
<br>
sysop: What is the purpose? Just don't be surprised when it answers back
<br>
&quot;You tell me, that's your job.&quot;
