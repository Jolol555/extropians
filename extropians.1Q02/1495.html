<em>&gt;From: &quot;Dickey, Michael F&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com?Subject=RE:%20a%20health%20dilemma">michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com</a>&gt;

<p><p><em>&gt;It is an aspect of our liberalized paternalistic victim based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society in the US now that has everyone thinking they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsible for their own actions.  Even Alcoholics Anonymous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teaches that alcoholism is a 'disease'.  I am sure that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with multiple sclerosis would LOVE to just *decide* to not have it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anymore.
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to correct some misconceptions here.
<br>
<p>MS is an autoimmune disease, it is caused by a genetic aberation
<br>
that causes the immune system to overreact to an innocuous
<br>
substance.
<br>
<p>Contrary to popular misconception you do not become an alcoholic
<br>
simply by drinking alcohol even though it is an addictive
<br>
substance, you are born an alcoholic. Alcoholism is a disease with
<br>
a genetic basis. 
<br>
<p>We have alcoholic rats, they prefer alcohol to anything else, and
<br>
we have teetotaler rats, who won't touch the stuff. Guess what
<br>
happens if you extract a specific enzyme from the alcoholic rats
<br>
and inject it into the teetotaler rats? That's correct, the former
<br>
teetotaler rats become instant alcoholics.
<br>
<p>Now someone with the proclivity to tolerate alcohol can develop a
<br>
dependance on the substance, in fact only people with a specific
<br>
genetic proclivity can. If someone with this proclivity does
<br>
develop a dependance then they have to make a conscious moral
<br>
decision to stop. There is considerable evidence that once a
<br>
dependance developes the individual remains sensitive to further
<br>
dependancy. I suspect a physiological change.
<br>
<p>Tobacco is also an addictive substance, but as far as I know it
<br>
doesn't have a genetic proclivity. This means that it is hard to
<br>
stop but not impossible.
