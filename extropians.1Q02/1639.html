<em>&gt; One thing that is clearly true from looking at the chart is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kenneth Lay has once had several hundred million dollars worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of stock options in Enron that are now essentially worthless.
</em><br>
<p>CNN is reporting that Lay sold more than half of his stock one year ago when
<br>
it was at its peak.  He also paid back loans to the company with stock which
<br>
was not included as stock sales.  They calculated that he made $200 million
<br>
on the stock with over $100 million profit after paying the fees to exercise
<br>
those options.  CNN also reports that Enron froze the employee's 401K funds
<br>
so that employees were prevented from selling their stock while executives
<br>
continued selling theirs.
<br>
<p>Lay and other executives did not lose money on stock.  They sold early and
<br>
made hundreds of millions in profits while investors lost money and
<br>
employees were blocked from selling their stock.  Internal Enron memos show
<br>
that executives knew they were &quot;probably&quot; going to have a financial
<br>
collapse, and that they were selling their stock, while at the same time
<br>
they were predicting massive profits to their employees and encouraging them
<br>
to buy even more stock.
<br>
<p>This was not a failure of the free market and capitalism.  This company did
<br>
not operate under those rules.
