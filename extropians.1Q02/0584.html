</em><br>
<p>Believe it or not, I actually tend to agree with the basic premise (but not 
<br>
the accompanying specifics) of Dossy's posts.  While I do very highly doubt 
<br>
that the WTC/Pentagon attacks were carried out by the US government, I also 
<br>
maintain no illusions that the public knows the majority of what the 
<br>
government is doing, or the reasons behind them.  All that we hear is 
<br>
filtered through the kaleidoscopic lens of the media...which means that we 
<br>
have some judiciously selected information from the government passed 
<br>
through biased reports.  Critical thinking dictates that we are not going 
<br>
to get the full story in any purely objective fashion, now, or perhaps ever.
<br>
<p>Having said this, beyond the premise of keeping our minds and eyes open 
<br>
enough to read between the lines of what we are told, I fail to see how any 
<br>
far-fetched speculation is all that productive, given that there is no hard 
<br>
proof on any conspiracy theory...probably much less evidence of such than 
<br>
other large events in the last half-century (e.g. Vietnam, Watergate etc.).
<br>
<p>Back in 1996, when the TWA jet went down, Ian Goddard spent years on 
<br>
fashioning his conspiracy theory (largely on this list, unfortunately) that 
<br>
the plane was shot down by a US Navy missile.  Perhaps there was merit to 
<br>
the theory, perhaps (probably) not.  The point is that idly speculating on 
<br>
ulterior motives is unproductive to say the least, and does neither the 
<br>
list nor the public in general any good.  So long as we have large 
<br>
democratic governmental institutions, we have no choice, really, but to 
<br>
accept what they do.  Discouraging?  Yes.  True?  Definitely.
