<p>I have a video taping with Tim discussing his views on death with me. While 
<br>
he still wore his cryonics bracelet, he also believed in an alternative 
<br>
choice for himself, and ultimately took this choice.  Tim was not 
<br>
completely committed to cryonics and his choice was not based on any one 
<br>
person or people.  He was weak and sick, and very, very tired.  He just 
<br>
wanted to pass on and leave his remains on the Internet and travel to what 
<br>
he thought was another type of existence.  While cryonics seemed to be 
<br>
futuristic and cool when he was healthier, when he was weakened it seemed 
<br>
almost too much for him - too many regulations.  Having to deal with a 
<br>
suspension team standing by was not what he wanted.  People in flowery 
<br>
cloths adorning him was what he thought he needed, and so he died, what I 
<br>
consider to be tragically.
<br>
<p>I know this first hand, and I saw him before he died on my wedding day.
