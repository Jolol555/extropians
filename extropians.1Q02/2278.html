</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only reason I could see for evolution to prefer using a single

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
That doesn't make sense to me. Genes can be read off both strands
<br>
because efficiency IS important.  It is important in bacteria (the
<br>
shorter it is, the quicker it can reproduce) and in viri (which has to
<br>
pack it into a protein) which is exactly where you are more likely to
<br>
see the tricks of genes on both strands and multiple reading frames on
<br>
each (and where junk DNA is non-existant).
