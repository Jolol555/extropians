<em>&gt;&gt;Tonight in chat I talked about nanotechnology with my very special ladyfriend.  The conversation got started when she said replicators(in the Star Trek form) would not be around within our lifetime.  I explained how with nanotech we would see home models within twenty to thirty years at the latest.  She had a real &quot;see it to believe it&quot; attitude! lol  I am going to have to get her reading Drexler's stuff!

<em>&gt;&gt;We made a bet that if nano-replicators are in homes by 2030, she will have to treat me to dinner at a nice restaurant!  And if not, than I'm the one footing the bill!

<em>&gt;&gt;Julie will be 57 by the year 2030, and I will ancient, too!!  I hope we're not too decrepit by the time 2030 gets here. :)

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have a prediction--you will pay in 2030.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Man, that's only 28 years from now! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Think about how different the world was 28 years ago:  actually, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was pretty much the same...the year was 1974.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transportation was pretty much the same.  Except cars get more gas per
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mile, and are more powerful and efficient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Medicine was pretty much the same--people died of cancer and heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disease at pretty much the same rates.  Older people were generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more lucid, however, probably due to the fact that there were fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind fogging drugs for them to take--although they do generally live a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit longer, I have noticed....but not all that much longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The world is definitely more polluted.  The beaches in Texas are an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absolute mess compared to what they were 28 years ago....The Gulf of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mexico is now your basic latrine...oh well, someone will no doubt drag
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the old cliche that the Potomac is less polluted today (geez, try
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking for yourself ocassionally; maybe that's b/c all the industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is gone from the northeast...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, there are some substantial advances, especially in electronics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and chemistry...and other INCREMENTAL engineering advances.
</em><br>
<p><p>The Internet and computers are by far the biggest difference
<br>
technologically between now and 1974, and actually, personal computers
<br>
were just about to bust out even then.
<br>
<p>Then Internet was around then also, in a primitive form (oh boy, here
<br>
come the trivia geeks....).
<br>
<p>But I digress.... maybe the biggest change is the potential for social
<br>
and political change that the Internet brings to us.
<br>
<p>It has the potential to be a huge factor in political reform, although
<br>
it has definitely not lived up to its potential; however, the
<br>
potential is there for it to literally transform the USA by
<br>
augmenting/bootstrapping grassroots political activism. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Also, the Internet has the potential to radically affect the
<br>
percentage of the population affected/brainwashed by religion memes.
<br>
There is now widely available to the public facts that show how
<br>
Christianity/Jesus Christ is an obvious descendant of earlier
<br>
religions; thus the Net has the potential for debunking forever the
<br>
minds of young people.  What effect this will have on society 30 years
<br>
or so down the road, time will only tell...
<br>
<p>There was a bit of this potential for social/political change that
<br>
came with the advent of the citizens band (CB)  radio in the 1970s.
<br>
One ossified old columnist in the Houston Chronicle even claimed that
<br>
the Internet was nothing more than a revamped CB radio...he's wrong.
<br>
That is like comparing a horse and cart with a 747.  They need to put
<br>
Leon Hale out to pasture....
<br>
<p>Oh, one more change between now and 1974---we don't go to the moon
<br>
anymore....I guess that is a good thing....well, maybe not....it was a
<br>
bi research experditure, thereby producing much serendipitous Good
<br>
Stuff.
