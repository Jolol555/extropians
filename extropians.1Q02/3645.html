I never meant to imply that none of these people have valid points to make.  In response to Alex's question, the reason that some people find these works frustrating is that the authors seem to want to put forth a rational argument, but choose to obfuscate their ideas by dressing them up in an unnecessarily baroque language.  This is less annoying when we're dealing with fiction or poetry, or when we just want to free-associate ideas rather than think in a rigorously rational manner.  It is in the latter sense that I've read and appreciated works like Baudillard's _In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities_, Latour's _Aramis_, and McLuhan's _Understanding Media_.  If you approach these books expecting to get find a fully fleshed-out theory you're going to be frustrated.  But if you approach it like beach combing and just wade through the literary curlicues and bric-a-brac looking for interesting ideas and metaphors you're bound to find some real gems.

<p>I agree with your analysis of the French (and derivative &quot;pomo&quot; ) 
<br>
thought.  However, the point to keep in mind that some of these people DO 
<br>
have valid - to some degree, presumably - points to make and dismissing it 
<br>
all as &quot;crap&quot; might be premature.  Not that I haven't done it in some 
<br>
instances... :-}
<br>
<p>I guess you have to decide whether the topic being discussed is worth the 
<br>
energy and time needed to decipher the propositions being made from the 
<br>
poetry being used to make them.
