<p>FIREWORKS... really BIG ones... and in this particular instance

size *does* matter.

<p><em>&gt; Doesn't the addition of preexisting heavy elements tend to

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the mass differential means swallowed planets (be they
<br>
of the English or African variety) don't make much of a difference.
<br>
Interestingly(!), I believe there is a paper out where astronomers have
<br>
detected a recent swallowing event.  I can't remember what the signature
<br>
element was, perhaps sodium -- I think those are bright lines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, I haven't heard you or anyone speak to Jeff's earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculation that there was something like 535 Earth masses of iron in
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not according to my #'s.  The Sun is 2.5E-5 Fe and 1.0E0 H.  I believe
<br>
this is by atom count.  Adjusting for the mass ratio, this gives a
<br>
solar mass fraction of ~0.02% Fe (about 7 times lower).   Using the
<br>
Solar wind element abundances, I get ~0.07% Fe (about 2 times lower).
<br>
So we are more or less within an order of magnitude.
<br>
<p>So you probably require a minimum of ~70 Earth masses of iron to
<br>
be deposited in the sun.  That's probably more than the rest of
<br>
the iron in the solar system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, how does the presence of this amount of iron (and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other metals) spike the Sun's development?
</em><br>
<p>Given the improbability of 70 Earth masses of iron being externally
<br>
injected into the sun, most of it was presumably there to start
<br>
with.  That means a moderately metal rich gas cloud which was
<br>
presumably seeded by a SN is the source for the material in the Sun.
<br>
<p>Worth noting is the fact that there are stars *more* metal rich
<br>
than the sun.  They have either swallowed a lot of planets or
<br>
formed in a very metal enriched environment.
