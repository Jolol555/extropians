<p><em>&gt; There would be tremendous economic advantages to being able to go faster.
</em><br>
<p>In *what* economy?  In a gift economy, any &quot;advantages&quot; of going
<br>
faster are entirely derived from a self-created feeling that you
<br>
like being appreciated by more people rather than fewer people.
<br>
<p>The entire concept of an &quot;economy&quot; breaks down when the doubling time
<br>
for our ability to manufacture things humans want exceeds the doubling
<br>
time of humans that want them.
<br>
<p>If I'm lying in the sun, soaking up a few thousand watts, using my 9G
<br>
wireless to immerse myself in the global matrix why should I care how
<br>
&quot;fast&quot; I go?  I just pick a world that is running at the speed I choose
<br>
to run at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [snip] There are any number of fields where speed of human information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing is the bottleneck.  Imagine if you could keep up with all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical or medical research relevant to your job.
</em><br>
<p>You *DON'T* HAVE JOBS!  You are trying to apply pre-singularity economic
<br>
concepts to a post-singularity reality.
<br>
<p>If you want to discuss this you should state clearly that you are
<br>
talking about the brief period when one has the technologies for
<br>
uploading slightly before the time when the evolution to demi-god
<br>
status makes the concept of a job completely irrelevant.  Thats
<br>
going to be a brief period IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no way a normal human can compete with someone who can think X times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster. The real problem, then, is what non-uploads will do with such a handicap,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not what uploads will do with their advantages.
</em><br>
<p>Its very simple.  If uploads respect the &quot;entity rights&quot; of the non-uploads
<br>
then there isn't any problem.  Any technology that allows uploading seems
<br>
likely to allow non-uploads to live for &quot;free&quot;.  There *isn't* any more
<br>
&quot;economy&quot; in the sense we currently understand it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, I don't think you would literally think for a month at a time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more than you do that today.  Rather, you would put in a month's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth of work in a vastly smaller amount of time.  You would still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take breaks, sleep, watch TV etc.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  Uploaded demi-gods can completely eliminate the need for sleep.
<br>
Watching TV is a form of entertainment/relaxation.  Why not just tune
<br>
the upload's perspectives that working 60 seconds of each minute is
<br>
the best thing in the world (as Doug says -- He loves his job).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Presumably a fast machine can be made to run slowly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you can interact with the real world, although it will be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive vacation (in terms of foregone income).
</em><br>
<p>There isn't any *income* model!  You build yourself into a free-entity
<br>
solar satellite and orbit around the sun.  You don't *need* an income!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other is to interact with other high-speed uploads.  Another form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of recreation is to just surf the net, participate in chats, enjoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-recorded video and music.  With hundreds of millions of people online,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even a vastly sped-up mentality can probably find enough novelty to keep him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested during breaks.
</em><br>
<p>This assumes you cannot simply create the &quot;feeling&quot; of satisfaction
<br>
that one has from interacting with other high-speed uploads and/or
<br>
millions of non-uploads.  If you can create the feeling what is the
<br>
point of expending the time on either of those activities?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure what you are saying here.  Is it that uploaded people don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need food and shelter (just virtual food and shelter) and so they won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have any expenses?
</em><br>
<p>Since one can &quot;tune&quot; what you think you need, this is correct.  Since
<br>
you can choose to operate at greater or lesser energy consumption rates,
<br>
the amount of &quot;food&quot; required may vary.  You don't need &quot;shelter&quot; in
<br>
the general sense.  Instead, what you need is guaranteed self-preservation.
<br>
In a high-trust collective with low-level agents taking care of maintenance,
<br>
estimation of potential hazards, etc. your energy requirements may be very
<br>
low.  In a low-trust collective, your energy (and matter) requirements
<br>
may be very high.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Presumably the upload needs to make enough to pay for that.
</em><br>
<p>Not if the material harvesting costs have been prepaid.  The energy cost
<br>
issue comes down to a fundamental question of whether systems allow
<br>
themselves to grow to the point of energy shortages.  If the majority
<br>
collectively decides that your fraction of the energy resources
<br>
is divided equally between you and any copies/children then the
<br>
tradeoffs are clearly defined.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then there are the tele-operated robot bodies he uses on vacation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those aren't cheap you know.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Compared to the computer/energy cost of an uploaded demi-god,
<br>
the cost of tele-operated robot bodies is dust in the wind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Plus he's going to run up quite a bill at Blockbuster Video renting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1000 videos a week.  That's a quarter million dollars a year right there.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but you are assuming current barriers to entry.  In a VR world,
<br>
the &quot;videos&quot; are entirely virtual.  So creating them is simply a
<br>
question of the amount of time one is willing to spend pixel editing.
<br>
So whether it is &quot;real&quot; actors &quot;gifting&quot; their acting (remember, they
<br>
don't have to *pay* to live) or &quot;virtual&quot; actors generated by computer
<br>
software agents generated by open-source projects supported by programmers
<br>
(who also dont have to *pay* to live) -- in the world you are describing
<br>
it seems like much of the entertainment should be &quot;free&quot;.  Writers, actors,
<br>
producers, etc. evaluate themselves not in terms of *income* but in terms
<br>
of &quot;market&quot; share.  The idea that you could create something that 200
<br>
million entities would take an interest in is reward enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uploads will have expenses, and there will probably be advantages to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich even if you are an upload.  There is no particular reason to expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to be free from economic motivations.
</em><br>
<p>One trips over the &quot;probably&quot;.  If your energy is &quot;free&quot; and &quot;guaranteed&quot;
<br>
what else do you care about?  There will clearly be a two-tier economy.  The
<br>
corporate &quot;buzz&quot; economy and the open-source &quot;free&quot; economy.  The open-source
<br>
economy will limit the margins that the buzz economy can achieve.  I might be
<br>
willing to pay 5x for a &quot;corporate&quot; Volvo over an &quot;open source&quot; Volkswagon but
<br>
I'd not be willing to pay 10x or 100x.
<br>
<p>People with any sense will realize that the &quot;buzz&quot; economy is largely
<br>
an ego/self-promotion driven economy.  There is no survival requirement
<br>
to play in that economy.  Its entirely driven off of &quot;Oh my god, like
<br>
I got to see Britney Spears live, in concert&quot; mentality.  There will
<br>
be some people that buy into that but I doubt it will be the majority.
<br>
<p>Ultimately it will devolve into a two-tier pricing system -- the
<br>
&quot;buzz&quot; level dictated by my desire to be able to &quot;brag&quot; about the
<br>
fact that I got to see the *real* Britney Spears live in concert
<br>
and the &quot;pragmatic&quot; level that is willing to settle for the VR
<br>
equivalent of the &quot;real thing&quot;.  If people really do in-depth
<br>
studies, the market mark-up will be limited to the *real* benefit
<br>
(how much additional security does this software/hardware really
<br>
provide) rather than the preceptions generated by advertising and/or
<br>
peer pressure.
