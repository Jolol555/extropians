Re: &quot;Politics of Transhumanism&quot; by J. Hughes
<br>
<p><p>Abstract:
<br>
<p>&quot;Contemporary transhumanism has grown out of white, male, affluent, American
<br>
Internet culture, and its political perspective has generally been a
<br>
militant version of the libertarianism typical of that culture. Nonetheless
<br>
transhumanists are becoming more diverse, with some building a broad liberal
<br>
democratic philosophic foundation in the World Transhumanist Association.
<br>
The essay also discusses the emergence of neo-Nazi and radical democratic
<br>
transhumanism.  For transhumanism to achieve its goals it needs to distance
<br>
itself from its anarcho-capitalist roots and its authoritarian mutations by
<br>
clarifying its commitments to liberal democratic institutions, values and
<br>
public policies. By embracing political engagement and the use of government
<br>
to address equity, safety and efficacy concerns about transhuman
<br>
technologies, transhumanists are in a better position to attract a larger,
<br>
broader audience.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anders -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wonderful, and thank you. A lot to think about. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brief response: I had two goals with the piece, first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descriptive and then to draw normative conclusions. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think your essay concurs that many &gt;Hists, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max More a couple days ago on this list and yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past, defined &gt;Hism more narrowly, permitting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broad group of ideologies to associate with them. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normative argument was that &gt;Hists who share liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic values should organize to make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those values shape the most visible expressions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism. You argument is that &gt;Hists should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize that there are core political values (i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberty, equality and solidarity) embedded in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trajectory of humanist Enlightenment values which give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise to &gt;Hism. I agree, and I think this makes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal democratic versions/expressions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism a more natural memetic evolution. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think this is a fruitful line of argument, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harbor Wittgensteinian(2) suspicions that we may just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be playing a word game, and that the memes will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recombine in ways that violate their pedigrees and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, you suggest that the value on individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberty in the liberal democratic tradition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereby - you argue - inside the &gt;Hist definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would suggest a global order tolerating a wide variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of social orders and in which any individual can leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nation for a nation more to their liking. Although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally agree with this principle, another principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of liberal democracy is solidarity - the obligation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect the human rights of other and uplift the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downtrodden. In terms of global order I think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires evolution towards a stronger global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government which can, for instance, make sure that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Declaration of Human Rights are enforced in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country. These solidaristic obligations are paired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with social contractual responsibilities to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the institutions that enable them. In other words, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think being subject to law and taxation can be argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from basic liberal democratic principles so long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one acknowledges more libdem principles (i.e. equality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and solidarity) than liberty. Even starting from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberty, as Amartya Sen has effectively argued, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can still arrive at the need for a social democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dark side of &gt;H tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes clearer than ever the need for global governance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and collective security.
</em><br>
<p>Than you for this deeply resonant and progressive discourse. The selfless sharing fosters mutual respect and tolerance of our
<br>
interdependent social consciousness, moral education, and character formation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A didactic solidarity in the network of social environments of diversity found in the normative shared values of multicultural
<br>
unity insures a just distribution of global resources through negation of internal contradiction. The institutions of civil society
<br>
and public policy are where good citizens ponder the great moral, legal and social issues of our time: synthesizing the dialectic
<br>
struggle in the unity of opposites that precipitates the transformation of society upon democratic lines.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social contractual duties in the community of humankind entail supporting these institutions, enabling them to facilitate
<br>
workers' acheiving emancipation from the pseudo-intellectual obfuscations of sound-money nuts and anti-income-tax-slavery cranks.
<br>
Virtuous actions of income redistribution in service of the class nature of liberal democratic principles create a humane and
<br>
democratic culture from the body politic itself. The holistic mixmaster of catagorical imperative draws from broad consensus and
<br>
shared moral and legal traditions to form communal values which must be judged by external and overriding criteria, based on shared
<br>
human experience, i.e. work will sweep away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and set them free. Those who
<br>
neglect these duties should explicitly, through the vulgar devices of  implied association and traducement, be cast as poor members
<br>
of the community.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society's indivisible concern is a passion to play on history- liberating the normless individual from the word-signs of mask and
<br>
guise; sharing in the freedom of action of the gestalt. A moral responsibility to vulnerable community members obligates the body
<br>
politic to foment a regime of rights and commitments under international law. The solidarity of internationalist global government
<br>
is a social struggle to liberate communal responsibility from the animalistic imperialism of national particularism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholarly consensus enables supreme control of the general will in preparing for submission to the shared aspirations of a
<br>
participatory global security landscape. Facilitation of cooperation rests on a solid foundation of collective strength under the
<br>
generous, charismatic leadership of esteemed public policy savants in order to actualize the infrastructure of a global governance
<br>
regime.
