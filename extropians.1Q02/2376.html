<p>As a libertarian, I am fully in support of mechanisms to cause energy
<br>
prices to accurately reflect the externalized costs of the particular
<br>
energy source they were generated from. The problem is, though, that
<br>
only a fraction of a percent of energy tax revinues, wherever they are
<br>
imposed, are ever spent on mitigating these externalized costs. The vast
<br>
majority go to supporting welfare state bureaucracies that subsidize
<br>
unproductivity. Furthermore, energy taxes are almost never imposed to
<br>
accurately reflect the true externalized costs, such as basing them on
<br>
carbon emissions. If they were, any nation that did so would rapidly
<br>
shift to a nuclear power based infrastructure.
<br>
<p>Drextech can construct diamondoid off of limestone instead, which is
<br>
where the other 52 Bars of earth's proto-atmosphere went. The other
<br>
choice is to only develop Drextech on Venus as part of a terraforming
<br>
project, building nanolaunchers whose purpose is to take carbon and
<br>
oxygen from Venus and ship it to Mars.
