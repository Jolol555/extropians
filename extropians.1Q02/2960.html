<em>&gt; &gt;this &quot;The no-brainer strategy to becoming wealthy&quot;.  It requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;taking $100-$1000 and depositing it in a savings account or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mutual fund and never withdrawing any funds from the account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;until the annual increase in the account value exceeds what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;one reasonably needs to live in the world.  It is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the idea that it doesn't require sophisticated investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;strategies to become wealthy, it simply requires living long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It would seem that Extropians/Transhumanists should be the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to recognize the paradigm shift and adopt this strategy.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't see any evidence that any of these individuals that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;know have done so.  So the &quot;interesting question&quot; is &quot;Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is this the case?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert, have you done any kind of survey of investing habits in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community? (That would be an interesting poll for ExI-Community.) Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have not seen evidence because you have not asked for it. Do you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any evidence to the contrary?
</em><br>
<p>It occurs to me that a high proportion of ExI people are involved in,
<br>
initiating or driving ventures, for a lack of a better term, of one sort or
<br>
another. Entrepreneurial and other fanaticisms are hard to keep leashed :) I
<br>
don't know about anyone else, but I can certainly attest to ventures being
<br>
hazardous to your investments and general fiscal health in the short term...
