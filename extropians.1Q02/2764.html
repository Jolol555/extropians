These two Cryonet posts tell of The Door Into Summer for-profit company which looks to be extremely promising.  I do wonder how their suspension protocols will compare to Alcor.  
<br>
<p>Between the Timeship and now this project, Saul Kent and Bill Faloon are really making a mark on cryonics.  Of course, they have been for years the biggest patrons of the movement.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>

<p>TDIS Comments (Sent to Cryonet and CI directors)
<br>
<p>Thanks to Saul Kent, Bill Faloon, and David Shumaker for the operating 
<br>
plan/budget for The Door Into Summer project (TDIS). As I read it, some of 
<br>
the elements include the following.
<br>
<p>TDIS will be a for-profit company which will, among other things, perform 
<br>
&quot;suspensions&quot; or freezings or vitrifications (both whole-body and neuro) for 
<br>
members of cryonics organizations, who will then be stored long term at those 
<br>
organizations. 
<br>
<p>It will also provide equipment and guidelines for cryonics organizations to 
<br>
do the suspensions themselves, using TDIS technology on a fee/license basis. 
<br>
<p>The first phase of operation is estimated to take about a year, and will 
<br>
develop and demonstrate a capability to do cryopreservation with 
<br>
vitrification.
<br>
<p>Initial operating cost (overhead) will be roughly $600,000 per year. Pricing 
<br>
will be a compromise between cost and affordability. Meeting costs will 
<br>
depend on expanding demand or/and generating revenues or supporting funds 
<br>
from &quot;originators, investors, or cryonics organizations&quot; or/and other 
<br>
activities.  
<br>
<p>Price for a vitrification cryopreservation performed by TDIS in Florida, 
<br>
exclusive of transportation costs and the charges of the cryonics 
<br>
organization providing the long term storage, will be around $40,000 for 
<br>
either neuro or whole body. If this holds up, it would mean that the cost to 
<br>
a CI member of whole body preparation by TDIS followed by storage at CI would 
<br>
be around $70,000 plus transportation.
<br>
<p>TDIS Board of Directors will consist of William Faloon, Mike Darwin, Saul 
<br>
Kent, CEO (David Shumaker?), and three independent outside directors.
<br>
<p>If I have misread any of this, no doubt someone will correct me.
<br>
<p>Again, thanks to those involved and best wishes for the Florida meeting 
<br>
Saturday, at which I expect a few of our people will attend.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You haven't misread anything in the plan/budget, but it's important
<br>
to 
<br>
note that the plan is an initial proposal and that the details of the
<br>
company may 
<br>
differ in various respects from what's in the plan. The meetings we have in
<br>
Florida 
<br>
will play a role in determining these details.  That's why it's important
<br>
for those who 
<br>
are interested in the venture to attend these meetings. A reminder. The
<br>
formal 
<br>
meeting is at the Life Extension Building, 1100 W. Commercial Blvd. in Ft.
<br>
Lauderdale at 2 pm on Feb. 16.  This will be followed by a buffet dinner at
<br>
a
<br>
condominium on the beach in Ft. Lauderdale (directions will be given at the
<br>
meeting).  There will also be informal meetings on Feb. 14 and 15.
