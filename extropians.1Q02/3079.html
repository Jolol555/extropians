</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it seems that we would expect that hot or high-density 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would want to gather as much matter as possible for storage, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while cool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations with lower memory density would rather burn their matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to power their computers. So given these assumptions the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilisations using nuclear storage would likely want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imitate cosmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dark matter...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This stuff about &quot;really advanced civilisations&quot; (or individuals, or some
<br>
other concept), moving to an optimal limit of computation and staying there
<br>
has always gnawed at me as a flawed notion. I guess I can't accept that the
<br>
most advanced beings in the universe would just accept a physical limitation
<br>
like that.
<br>
<p>I think of &quot;optimal&quot; energy/matter ratio refered to above as &quot;cruising
<br>
speed&quot;. Does it seem unlikely that there might be higher entropy
<br>
alternatives that allow qualitative improvements in computational ability,
<br>
compared to cruising speed?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that we must consider the motivation of these beings. Why do
<br>
they want to sit at cruising speed, cognitively, until the universe finally
<br>
dissembles into total entropy? These are beings who, it must be supposed,
<br>
have altered themselves *radically* to get to where they are; not
<br>
conservatives I think. Early adopters in a past life ? :-)
<br>
<p>One must consider finally that the sole purpose of these entities is to
<br>
think. Really, deeply think. Unless they get to a point where there is no
<br>
more to think about, before they hit the limits of cruise speed, could these
<br>
entites possibly be satisfied stopping at what, to them, must seem an
<br>
entirely arbitrary point?
<br>
<p>When the lifetime of the universe begins to loom as a large concern to you,
<br>
I think you would want to find a way out of the box. If burning the candle
<br>
at both ends could make a difference, if sacrificing quantity of computation
<br>
for quality &quot;right now&quot; was possible, it would have to be done. If nothing
<br>
else, just for the chance to be all that you could be.
