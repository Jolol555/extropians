eir own.  What are the 85 to do?
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, the minority eat meat and vegetables and consume most
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of it too.   One option is to create more resource and

<em>&gt; distribute them more broadly.  And also it might be good to eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less meat so not so much habitat is consumed feeding cattle. :)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this is a false assertion. Muslims are not vegetarians, nor is
<br>
most of North and South America, Europe, Africa, and much of Asia. The
<br>
primary concentration of vegans are in India and China, which represent
<br>
only 1/3 of the human race. Since that one third has the highest rate of
<br>
reproduction as well, the smarter option is for the vegans to stop
<br>
screwing like rabbits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course there is no 85% fine people who are protective and 15%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are murderous.  It is highly artificial.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the murderous percentage lies closer to 0.5-2% in peaceful times,
<br>
but in many instances, propaganda campaigns can quicly boost that
<br>
percentage to a majority of the population, especially when there is a
<br>
large surplus of males.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1) Hunt down and convert, or, failing that, kill the 15 so that all may live their lives unendangered and those working on liberation may continue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2) Join the 15 to avoid being murdered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3) Blithely ignore the 15 and hope that one's own number does not come up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4) Try to understand the killers as members of an alternative yet equally valid lifestyle and attempt constructive and nonjudgemental dialogue with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5) Assert that the 85 deserve such a fate because of real or imagined historical wrongs and await their fate with a sense that an incomprehensibele (or maybe comprehensible, but these would most likely convert) divine justice was being meted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I stand squarely with alternative #1.  I see Samantha as embracing alternatives #4 or #5 or perhaps a syncretism of the two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is very dishonest.  I do not claim that killers are of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally valid lifestyle.  I do claim and am quite correct in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this that the terrorist have at least some claims of wrong-doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that should be examined on their own merits regardless of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source.  Where we are in the wrong and can improve things we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should in the interest of greater peace and well-being for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working toward liberation.  But that doesn't mean we condone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism in the least or do not punish it.
</em><br>
<p>Funny, Samantha, are you not one of the people who sincerely believe
<br>
that two wrongs do not make a right? In such case, it is rather
<br>
disengenuous of you to assert that just because a terrorist has been
<br>
wronged in the past (or people s/he has never met in his life has been
<br>
wronged) that this somehow justifies their commission of wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I most certainly never said or implied (5).  My interest is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in getting to &quot;liberation&quot; (Singularity) with as many of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fellow sentients on board as possible.  I think you can get more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on board by addressing real grievances even while ending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barbaric acts of terrorism of all kinds.   I believe you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get more people on board by welcoming more people on board
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whenver you can without inviting your destruction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is that clear enough?
</em><br>
<p>Crystal. Fortunately I, and many others here, are not so motivated to
<br>
drag every other human kicking and screaming into the singularity. Some
<br>
are simply dead weight, ballast, who are working actively against the
<br>
singularity and they will need to be excised from the global body if we
<br>
are to reach the goal.
