<em>&gt; &gt; John Ashcroft doesn't like the bare-breasted statue of Justice.  He makes

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In what way is this bad?  As far as I can tell, he's just optimizing his

<em>&gt; &gt; Ashcroft tried to impose this preference on others, but the above article

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Legally, he probably does have the discretion to decide how to spend
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the esthetic value of that art.  But when generations of his predecessors
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's my point - at some point, even in a libertarian government, someone
<br>
needs to have personal responsibility for the artistic appearance of
<br>
public buildings.  There is nothing wrong with Ashcroft taking charge of
<br>
the appearance of his building.  Curtains are not &quot;vandalism&quot; and he is
<br>
not destroying his predecessors' efforts, just temporarily switching them
<br>
off.  Sure, Ashcroft's decision may only be temporary; sure, we may
<br>
disagree with it; my point is that is that it is legitimately Ashcroft's
<br>
decision.  How would we feel if a transhumanist Attorney General were
<br>
mocked in the media for putting a curtain over, say, a painting of God
<br>
judging sinners?
