</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, let's see...
<br>
<p>AI can take a self-consistent set of requirements and turn them into
<br>
running code?  Show me the CEO or marketer who can give a
<br>
self-consistent set of requirements, *especially* in commitee.  (Well,
<br>
ok, they do exist, but they're rare.)  Transition to translator, and
<br>
ex-coder still has job.
<br>
<p>AI can also translate from vague, incoherent requirements into running
<br>
code, including the inevitable arguing back and forth to nail the specs
<br>
down enough?  &quot;Hey, AI I just rented: hack into various corporate
<br>
networks' financial programs and score me a nest egg to retire on.  Make
<br>
sure no one, except maybe you and/or I, can trace the hack or anything
<br>
related to it back to you and/or I.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ok, that's a gimme, and it'd only last until the AIs taking over the
<br>
corporate networks finally implement adequate security.  Where next for
<br>
the ex-coders not lucky enough to get a job working on these ever
<br>
improving AIs?  Tinker with the AI a bit and, &quot;Hey, AI: find me a job.&quot;
<br>
^_^;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just hope that the speed of the change is moderated so that people are OK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes I have nightmare visions of being ostracised at the local market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and having people throw rocks at my house out of the fear of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (potentially) very smart little grey box in my office.
</em><br>
<p>If I'm ever in that situation (which implies moving away from an area
<br>
where many residents would have a similar box), I'd probably also be
<br>
rich enough to buy the local police and have the rock-throwers arrested
<br>
en masse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it any wonder that VCs could see a marketing nightmare? How do you market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an Anti-Christ?. I think you don't. I've seen many a developmental paths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involving trojan horses and stealth, and I think this may have to be one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Attention, oppressed masses of the Muslim world.  What do you say we
<br>
beat the infidels at their own game?  Lo, they have thought of a way to
<br>
bring Allah's wisdom to the masses.  See how they tremble in fear when
<br>
they contemplate its potential existence.  Let us bring their nightmare
<br>
to life, and in so doing, bring about our new golden age.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hey, it *could* work, if they stressed the specific &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; label
<br>
enough, and the oil money was still available enough...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Beware, fellow list members.....is <a href="mailto:xyz@whatever.com?Subject=Re:%20rambling%20question%20on%20AI">xyz@whatever.com</a>, happily bantering with

</em><br>
<p>I would agree, in the sense that a mature attitude is that, if you can't
<br>
tell whether the entity is a self-aware AI or a human being, it usually
<br>
won't matter much...in the same sense that we can not tell each others'
<br>
skin color from email, and it does not matter much as far as our
<br>
interactions with each other.
