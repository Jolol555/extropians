<p><em>&gt;I didn't take that test, but it sounds exactly like the Nolan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chart. That chart shows up here periodically. It has a long history,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my first recollections of that chart is around 1986 (Does anyone know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the year it was created?).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From the FAQ on self-gov.org:
</em><br>
&quot;The chart that is the centerpiece of the Quiz is based on a chart
<br>
devised in 1969 by political scientist David Nolan. Nolan, a
<br>
libertarian (he co-founded the Libertarian Party in 1971) came up with
<br>
the chart because he was frustrated by the old &quot;left-right&quot; line that
<br>
leaves no room for libertarians and others.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thanks for the pointer to the chart and the self-gov web site. I have
<br>
taken the quiz, and scored &quot;left-liberal&quot;, close to &quot;libertarian&quot;. On
<br>
the Political Compass I score &quot;libertarian-left&quot;, two or three clicks
<br>
away from the center. The definitions given at self-gov.org are:
<br>
&quot;Libertarians are self-governors in both personal and economic
<br>
matters. They believe government's only purpose is to protect people
<br>
from coercion and violence. They value individual responsibility, and
<br>
tolerate economic and social diversity.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Left-Liberals prefer self-government in personal matters and central
<br>
decision-making on economics. They want government to serve the
<br>
disadvantaged in the name of fairness. Leftists tolerate social
<br>
diversity, but work for economic equality.&quot;
<br>
I can recognize my own thinking in the last definition, with some
<br>
changes: &quot;to serve ALSO the disadvantaged&quot;, &quot;work to create safety
<br>
nets to protect the disadvantaged from the worse consequences of
<br>
economic differences&quot;.
<br>
I certainly do not want &quot;economic equality&quot;, that has been tried and
<br>
does not work. I believe that everybody has a right to make money as a
<br>
reward for his/her initiatives, and that the free market provides a
<br>
very good mechanism for it. At the same time I also do not like to see
<br>
old people excluded from good standards of health care, or young
<br>
people excluded from good standards of education. So perhaps the best
<br>
compromise is when the government has a fundamentally lasseiz-faire
<br>
approach, but carefully analyses ongoing social and economic dynamics
<br>
and takes corrective actions in a few, exceptional cases (this is how
<br>
modern Western systems are meant to function, even if in practice it
<br>
does not always work well).
<br>
Another definition of &quot;libertarian&quot; given on self-gov.org is:
<br>
&quot;Libertarians believe that, on every issue, you have the right to
<br>
decide for yourself what's best for you and to act on that belief so
<br>
long as you respect the right of other people to do the same and deal
<br>
with them peacefully and honestly.&quot;
<br>
Now I find this a very beautiful sentence, one that I completely agree
<br>
with. The point I wish to make is that, in a complex system like our
<br>
modern society, sometimes it may be difficult to be sure that acting
<br>
on what seems to be a right does not result in unintentionally harming
<br>
others. One may not have all the information available to make a good
<br>
decision, or not have the time to think it through, or the issue may
<br>
be too complex for an individual to analyse it carefully. Or, one may
<br>
just not care. So what is wrong with having complex issues
<br>
pre-analysed and, in exceptional cases, outlawing behaviours that with
<br>
high probability cause more harm than good?
