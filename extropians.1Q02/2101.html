</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; The question then becomes, if we assume that the above is fundamentally correct, under what circumstances would we be able to make all the derivatives positive?  If this is impossible, then why try living forever?
</em><br>
<p>An exponential function, e^x, trivially satisfies the above requirement. 
<br>
I don't see why e^x is inherently more fun than x^2, since I would deny
<br>
the idea that we become &quot;bored&quot; with derivatives, derivatives of
<br>
derivatives, and so on.  Singularity Fun Theory says that we become bored
<br>
with repetition.  There is no inherent reason why e^x would be seen as
<br>
less predictable than x^2; they are both functions of roughly the same
<br>
complexity.
<br>
<p>In Singularity Fun Theory, it's the *content* of the space, not the size
<br>
of the space, that determines the amount of &quot;fun&quot; - in other words, as
<br>
long as you haven't exhausted the Fun Space for that size limit, you can
<br>
go on having fun within limit N.  Eventually you must exhaust a Fun Space
<br>
of any finite size, and the more intelligent you are, the faster a given
<br>
volume of Fun Space will be exhausted (because of your ability to
<br>
generalize better).  Singularity Fun Theory says, don't worry, the volume
<br>
of Fun Space you can understand also gets bigger with intelligence. 
<br>
Anyway my point is that if you generalize *on the level of the pleasure
<br>
counter*, then you'll get bored with a pleasure function of e^x just as
<br>
fast as x^2; both are functions that a cognitive system would learn to
<br>
predict.  Singularity Fun Theory's answer is to exempt this level from
<br>
antisphexishness routines, along with the ultimate lowest level of the
<br>
system where it's all ones and zeroes, for the same reason in both cases;
<br>
there doesn't seem to be even the theoretical possibility of avoiding
<br>
&quot;repetition&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you did want to avoid repetition on the level of the pleasure counter
<br>
itself, the best approximation would be to use the busy beaver function,
<br>
not an exponential function.  The busy beaver function for N being the
<br>
largest number of tape marks produceable by a halting Turing machine with
<br>
N or fewer states, and hence, a number that &quot;forces&quot; an ascent to the next
<br>
level of complexity in order to understand it.  And that is a level of
<br>
ascending resource requirements that even ontotechnology would be hard-put
<br>
to supply.
<br>
<p>Busy beaver for small values:
<br>
<p>BB(1) = 1
<br>
BB(2) = 4
<br>
BB(3) = 6
<br>
BB(4) = 13
<br>
BB(5) &gt;= 4098
<br>
BB(6) &gt;= 1.29*10^865
