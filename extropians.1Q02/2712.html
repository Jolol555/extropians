<em>&gt; I can't speak toward your personal experience, Mike, or for Amara's,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I, for one, refuse to concede that there's no such thing as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible drug user.  Yes, drug abuse can lead to actual crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against others, and those crimes should be prosecuted, but rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people don't make the mistake of confusing the instrument with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime: that's the same argument of the gun-banners.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this argument is that a gun doesn't chemically alter
<br>
the mental processes by which the user makes decisions about responsible
<br>
use. It is a highly recursive tool, in that it alters the thought
<br>
process that initiates its use. 
<br>
<p>Now, I did say that I delineate between drug users and drug addicts.
<br>
There is a distinctive difference, both physiologically and
<br>
psychologically, between a casual user and an addict, as well as between
<br>
a modest dosage and an impairing dosage. 
<br>
<p>This is why drunk driving laws have specific blood alcohol limits which
<br>
are allegedly supposed to reflect a point at which a persons judgement
<br>
is sufficiently impaired that they shouldn't drive. Similar impairment
<br>
levels can be applied to other drug use. The only reason they are not as
<br>
widely applied is that a breathalyser test generally cannot test for
<br>
such substances, but there are limits set by statutes which are
<br>
generally met evidentially by blood tests performed at police stations.
<br>
<p>If such dosage limits were not scientifically justifiable, they would
<br>
not be law. Similarly, the fact that they exist supports my arguments
<br>
that impaired individuals cannot be treated as responsible rational
<br>
adults while impaired.
<br>
<p>There are other dosage related statutes: drunk while in posession of a
<br>
firearm is a crime in many states. Merely being served alcohol while
<br>
armed is a crime in some states.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And further, while forfeiture cases may seem justified on criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drug-abuse grounds, the reality of the law and its present application
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that they are simply government theft of private property without due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process.  No conviction--or even formal accusation--of any crime is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary for a forfeiture.  Due process and the rights of the accused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't apply, because no person is being accused: the property itself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being accused (the court cases have wonderful titles like &quot;U.S. vs. 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bottles of Wine&quot;)  Anyone who supports such forfeiture laws is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian, regardless of the pretext used to justify them.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not  justifying them, as they are in my opinion a poor tool for the
<br>
intended purpose, in many ways the most unuseful you can make a legal
<br>
instrument perform its intended purpose. 
<br>
<p>However I doubt there are many instances where the government can seize
<br>
property without some burden of evidence to support such a claim before
<br>
a judge. The drug seizure laws specifically say that the owner must have
<br>
been charged with a drug offense, and dropping, dismissing, or acquittal
<br>
does justify return of the property. Several people I know who have gone
<br>
through such a situation were offered their property back when charges
<br>
were dropped in one case, and acquitted in the other.
<br>
<p>I also consider what you point out, that the property itself is accused,
<br>
not the property owner, to be a very specious legal mechanism. The idea
<br>
of bringing a case against an inanimate object is ludicrous.
<br>
<p>A friend of mine, Jeff Steinborn, was one of the lawyers who argued
<br>
against these forfeiture laws before the Supreme Court on double
<br>
jeopardy grounds and lost.
<br>
<p>If you accept that income tax laws are valid, then the argument that
<br>
property purchased with unreported income can be seized in lieu of
<br>
payment is also valid. If you want your property back, pay the taxes
<br>
owed.
