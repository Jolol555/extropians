<p>
With regard to Enron executive compensation, the NY Times has
<br>
an article:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/22/business/22PLAC.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/22/business/22PLAC.html</a>
<br>
<p>Most of Lay's compensation was in stock options, most of which
<br>
I expect were probably underwater during 2001 (i.e. the exercise
<br>
price on the options was below the open market price on the stock).
<br>
<p>It is a little known fact about stock options that when you exercise
<br>
them, you have to pay taxes on the difference between the exercise
<br>
price and the market price.  If the differential is wide this can
<br>
lead to a very significant tax bill with no funds to pay for them
<br>
unless you sell the stock.  If you sell the stock this of course
<br>
increases your tax bill, typically at short term capital gains rates.
<br>
If the stock price declines significantly after exercise, you can get
<br>
screwed by this (have to pay a tax bill but lack the resources to pay
<br>
for it).
<br>
<p>Its a complex part of the tax code and given the probable run-up
<br>
of Enron stock (and Lay's other investments) in '99 and early '00,
<br>
followed by the rapid decline I could see him getting caught in
<br>
a squeeze big time.
<br>
<p>One thing that is clearly true from looking at the chart is that
<br>
Kenneth Lay has once had several hundred million dollars worth
<br>
of stock options in Enron that are now essentially worthless.
<br>
