<p><em>    &gt;from Darwin's  letters and stuff you read in the book he really appears
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;(to me at  least) as a very, very nice person. Sensitive, funny, intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; honest, delicate.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, almost everybody seems to have liked the man personally, even those
<br>
who hated his theories. However there doesn't seem to be any relationship
<br>
between friendliness and intelligence because the other great genius the
<br>
human race has produced, Isaac Newton, was as unpleasant a man as
<br>
you could find. If it wasn't for his boiling water IQ (Fahrenheit of course)
<br>
nobody would want anything to do with him. Darwin on the other hand
<br>
would be fun to be with even if you took away his genius.
<br>
<p>My favorite nonscientific Darwin quotation comes from his autobiography.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but at last was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was correct. I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.&quot;
<br>
<p>The first edition of the Autobiography published in 1896  just 6 months after
<br>
Darwin's death did not include the quotation, due to the insistence of his
<br>
very religious wife Emma. Her letter to the publisher written in her own hand
<br>
survives, she wrote:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;I should dislike the passages in brackets to be published. It seems to me raw.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can be said too severe upon the doctrine of everlasting punishment for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disbelief- but very few wd call that  Christianity.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think she was being overgenerous, even today lots of people would call that
<br>
Christianity. Anyway, after Emma's death in 1896 the passage  was restored
<br>
to the book.
