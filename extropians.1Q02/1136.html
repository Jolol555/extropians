<br>
<em>&gt; We were complaining about how uneven government laws are applied.
</em><br>
<p>To be fair, laws need to be applied unevenly, because social reality is
<br>
uneven.
<br>
For example, the law says parents must provide for their children, and
<br>
children require uneven provisions, with big ones needing more than little
<br>
ones, and fast ones needing it sooner than slower ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, it is worse when there are no children.
</em><br>
<p>Usually that's because the adults feel that *they* must act like children.
<br>
(I know...   that's not funny.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Legally speaking, domestic partners are not recognized as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatives by the government.  Thus, any far flung cousin that has never met
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the deceased can come in and take away property from the surviving partner.
</em><br>
<p>Not true. In California, couples (married or not) can take title to real
<br>
estate as community property, joint tenants, tenants in common, or any way
<br>
they want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even clearly-specific wills are often overturned.
</em><br>
<p>A properly drafted will can supercede rights of survivorship of relatives.
<br>
When overturned, it's because the will in question was not properly composed.
<br>
YMMV, so see your lawyer.
<br>
<p>&quot;Transgender marriage&quot; is a contradiction of terms, because marriage means the
<br>
mutual relation of husband and wife. Therefore, as soon as two people get
<br>
married, gender roles are assigned, regardless of genitalia involved. In a
<br>
homosexual marriage, one partner is the husband and the other is the wife, so
<br>
gender has not been transcended.
<br>
In order to actually transcend gender, couples need to stay unmarried, because
<br>
by definition, marriage automatically assigns a gender to each partner.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
