<p>This is the second time today that you've inserted something like
<br>
this into my words.  Let me requote the original:
<br>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;     [R]&gt;How, exactly, did you learn that animals (which, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     [R]&gt;for some primates, can't let you know directly) are aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     [R]&gt; themselves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
[J]&gt; Nothing can let you know directly they are aware of themselves, so how
<br>
[J]&gt; did I know they were conscious? I guessed, just as I guessed that you
<br>
[J]&gt; are sentient and that I am not the only conscious being in the universe.
<br>
<p>But since they aren't providing the cues that I am (e.g., they aren't 
<br>
holding conversations about conversations with you), I'd like to know
<br>
what evidence you have that they really are aware of themselves in
<br>
a way that, for instance, a rock isn't.
<br>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br>
<p>Is this really so unclear that you thought that I had suddenly switched
<br>
to arguing that other people aren't people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I said I guessed, I guessed that you can't have intelligence without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness. I'll never be able to prove it obviously, but the evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from evolution is not bad and I know with certainty of one example where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two are linked, when I'm not conscious I'm not very smart. On balance I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's a pretty good guess.
</em><br>
<p>I would guess that you have have arbitrarily complex problem solving 
<br>
without consciousness.  That is, with a sufficiently detailed statement of 
<br>
the problem, I'd imagine that it would be possible to develop an algorithm
<br>
to solve the problem without consciousness as a side effect.
<br>
<p>Now that we're both down to guessing, I guess that this argument is dead. ;)
