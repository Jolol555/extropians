Hi Michael,
<br>
<p>Best to you during your sabbatical.
<br>
<p>Like most watering holes, they are often more aptly tasted in person where 
<br>
we can sip and smile and exchange in breezy styles or in quiet reflection.
<br>
<p>Email lists are great exercise tools to communicate but sometimes not the 
<br>
best way to quench a thirst -- or  300 - 400 subscriber's thirsts. This 
<br>
list has certainly done what it can to accommodate all, and even gone 
<br>
beyond the pall.  So many people want to keep this pioneering and heady 
<br>
list intact, rather than letting it run dry because of too much excess.  It 
<br>
seems it, the list, is being treated respectfully by variability.  In order 
<br>
to keep the list going for years to come, sometimes it's necessary to make 
<br>
changes to help it grow in the directions we want.  Adaptively and 
<br>
flexibility are assets, especially when its for quality.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts, and drink up.
<br>
<p>warmly,
<br>
<p>Natasha
