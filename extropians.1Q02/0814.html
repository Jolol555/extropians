<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps our universe (or at least our portion of the universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such as our solar system) is &quot;farmed&quot; by highly advanced beings.

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps life on Earth was &quot;seeded&quot; by these advanced beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps these beings (who may live for a couple million years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or indefinitely long, even) felt it was more &quot;cost&quot; effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (not monetary, obviously, but perhaps in work effort required)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to create millions of solar systems and life on each to let

<em>&gt; &gt; whatever purpose.  Perhaps we're merely entertainment -- like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an ant farm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is of course, &quot;wildly irrational speculation&quot; but since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we seem to be partaking in it, I might as well throw out my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is important to learn what is rational and irrational speculation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What people like Robert, Anders, John, etc are engaging in is rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculation based entirely on sound and established scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Talk of humanity being farmed by alien races is irrational speculation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it assumes facts not in evidence: i.e. the presence of aliens on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth at any time in history or prehistory as far as we can determine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, as soon as real material evidence of such a presence is found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and announced, such speculation then can become rational speculation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a fine distinction, but one that separates science from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supermarket tabloids.
</em><br>
<p><p>Funny, Robert mentions the idea of seeding and creating &quot;independent
<br>
actors&quot; ... why is it when I suggest the notion, it becomes
<br>
irrational speculation?
<br>
<p>I never suggested the presence of aliens on Earth, or anywhere
<br>
inside our solar system, for that matter.  I was suggesting that
<br>
what we &quot;know&quot; to be a &quot;natural&quot; creation (our universe) may very
<br>
well not be.  However, I suggest that it also wasn't &quot;engineered&quot;
<br>
in so much as pouring a cup of sand onto a tabletop is &quot;engineering&quot;
<br>
the pattern the sand creates -- the initial action (pouring the sand,
<br>
or creating our universe) may be &quot;engineering&quot; but the end result
<br>
(sand pattern on table, or our universe as we know it) is &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
in that it occurred from obeying laws of nature, not as a construction
<br>
made to the specification of some external non-natural force.
