<p><em> &gt; John -- can you make the case that you equally distribute your
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; energies on a *per* death basis for each premature cause of death
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; that occurs in the U.S. (or the world)?
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; The following cause more deaths annually in the U.S. than the 911
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; attacks: Suffocation, Fires &amp; Burns, Drowning, Poisoning by solids
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; and liquids, Falls and Motor vehicle crashes (from lowest to highest).
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; Motor vehicles, in particular kill more than an *order of magnitude*
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; annually relative to the 911 attacks.
</em><br>
<p>And cigarettes kill more Americans every two days than died in 911.
<br>
It's true that murder stirs up the reptilian parts of the brain more than
<br>
death by accident or death that results from a foolish decision on
<br>
the part of the victim. But there must be a reason for that, there must
<br>
be some wisdom in that sort of behavior or evolution would not have
<br>
preserved it for several hundred million years.
<br>
If a meteor were to crash through my roof and kill my daughter I would
<br>
be sad but not angry, if a person broke into my house and killed her I
<br>
would be both. I can't deter another rock from falling from the sky and
<br>
doing the same thing again but I might be able to deter another human
<br>
being from becoming a murderer.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I don't see anyone here taking the &quot;hawk&quot; position over in Afghanistan
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;attempting to &quot;prevent more thousands of deaths&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>If I thought  the action in Afghanistan did not have good chance of
<br>
preventing thousands of more murders then even though my reptilian medulla
<br>
would still be crying for revenge my rational neocortex would outvote it and I
<br>
would recommend doing absolutely nothing as regards to 911.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Where are the reports of letters written to consumer safety commissions?
</em><br>
<p>You won't see any from me. Forcing people to double the price of a product and
<br>
tripling the difficulty of operating it in order to increase its safety by .01% is not
<br>
my cup of tea.
