<p>I don't think so, there are several orders of magnitude difference

between the complexity of a Fine Motion Controller and an Assembler

Arm and several more orders of complexity to get to nanorobots
<br>
and several more orders to get to nanorobot systems.

<p>Unless you can make a very strong assertion that something like
<br>
molecular electronics enables an up-evolving AI that can rapidly
<br>
crack the complixity hurdles, nanotech is going to only impact
<br>
society over a 10-20 year period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the same is likely to be true of &quot;true&quot; AI,

<p>*If* you make the assertion that there aren't complexity &quot;ceilings&quot;
<br>
or evolutionary &quot;dead-ends&quot;.  If intelligence turns out to be
<br>
like the process of solving systems of linear equations, then
<br>
we may have one method with very fixed properties for quite
<br>
a long time before a completely different approach from another
<br>
branch of mathematics provided a better solution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; vastly extended lifespan, and other major advances.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with vastly extended lifespans is that it may very
<br>
well be that to know for *sure* if your life extending technologies
<br>
will really &quot;work&quot;, you are going to have to do atomic level
<br>
simulations of entire organs for very long periods of time.
<br>
We aren't going to have the computational capacity for doing
<br>
that any time in the near future.
<br>
<p>I'd limit the fully developed nano-entitites to 4 things:
<br>
mass, energy and &quot;nano-scale system designs&quot; and the
<br>
means to turn the mass into the systems.  I'd tend to
<br>
agree that the only thing worth trading is information.
<br>
<p>Whether we still have an &quot;economy&quot; will depend on how far
<br>
down the path we go towards a hive mind mentality.  Our
<br>
bodies and brains presumably have &quot;economies&quot; for the
<br>
allocation of resources -- whether there is an &quot;external&quot;
<br>
economy depends on the extent to which &quot;we&quot; grow to encompass
<br>
everything worth &quot;exchanging&quot;.
