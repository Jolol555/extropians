<p>I don't see any reason to believe that is likely to be the case.

People may simply tire of life.  They may go &quot;offline&quot;.  A consensus
<br>
may developt to completely re-architect the SI to focus on a particularly
<br>
interesting problem of art or math or string theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems plausible that they will quickly settle into
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well one stable long term goal would seem to be self-preservation.
<br>
It doesn't require rocket science to realize that one will eventually
<br>
(in the far far distant) future be in competition with ones clones.
<br>
How that effects ones reproduction decisions now isn't clear.
<br>
If humans are an example, some do and some don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, I think rational design and goal-oriented action will play
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; governing how SIs change over time.
</em><br>
<p>But what is &quot;rational design&quot;?  Isn't it based on a prior knowledge base
<br>
being applied based on principles of what has previously worked?  We know
<br>
now that &quot;evolved&quot; neural and electrical circuits can go places that humans
<br>
can't design and have a difficult time understanding how they work once they
<br>
are developed.  How can we say SIs will not use similar methods to explore the
<br>
space &quot;outside&quot; of what can be seen from an existing &quot;rational design&quot; perspective?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human beings are able to preserve trust relationships over periods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparable to their life times. Why shouldn't SIs be able to do the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing? What problem will prevent them from doing this over millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years?
</em><br>
<p>Humans don't have the ability to turn themselves into something completely
<br>
different from what they are?  I cannot currently turn myself into a dog.
<br>
I am fundamentally a human with evolved structures that generally dictate my
<br>
social interactions with other humans -- just as a dog has different evolved
<br>
structures that dictate their interactions with other dogs.  SIs do not
<br>
generally have significant amounts of &quot;social&quot; interaction.  They spend
<br>
most of their time alone in the vast reaches of space.  So its entirely
<br>
possible that trust relationships and social interaction guidelines might
<br>
never naturally evolve.  I agree that there might be some universal
<br>
optimal behavior from a game theoretic standpoint.
<br>
<p>As has been discussed before on the list, one may always play nice
<br>
at the SI level because one can never guarantee that an entity one might
<br>
betray has not prepared berzerker-bots in response for just such
<br>
a situation.  One plays nice because survival depends on it.
<br>
<p>That means in the final ultra-long term future, SIs don't consume
<br>
each other but themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can fuse hydrogen into metals and build your reactors in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponential bootstrapping process. It doesn't seem to be an insurmountable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it would be nice to know the rate of increase on this.
<br>
The flat part of the curve could be many millions of years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, do you consider full matter-to-energy conversion via small black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holes to be &quot;magical physics&quot;? If not that would allow you to disassemble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a star even more quickly.
</em><br>
<p>True.  I suppose I would have to see some concrete plans for how
<br>
to move the black hole someplace where it can be put to good use
<br>
and a way of generating more useful than non-useful energy.
<br>
If most of the energy comes out as gamma and X-rays then it seems to
<br>
be a pretty hellish environment where even with full scale nanotech
<br>
one might be expending a significant fraction of the energy,
<br>
dismantling and reassembling the machinery as well as sorting and
<br>
breeding the isotopes being generated just to harvest some fraction
<br>
of the energy available.
<br>
<p>It might not be &quot;magical physics&quot;, simply &quot;impractical physics&quot;.
<br>
