<p>Mike how much did you pay for their services back when it worked?
<br>
The internet has trained us all to expect good things for nothing.  I
<br>
couldn't ever see what was in it for them.  They didn't carry advertising.
<br>
Why would we expect them to stay in business, if that is ever what
<br>
they were in?  spike
