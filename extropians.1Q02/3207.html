<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Well, my first reaction to this was to laugh and say, &quot;I give up!&quot;  Some
</em><br>
days
<br>
<em>&gt; you just can't win...
</em><br>
<p><p>And you're right, you can't &quot;win&quot;. Or at least it is probably impossible to
<br>
&quot;win&quot;. And if it is possible to &quot;win&quot;, then you just don't have the
<br>
necessary skills yet to &quot;win&quot;. Like the cliché goes, you can't please
<br>
everyone all of the time.
<br>
<p>I put &quot;win&quot; in quotes as a form of markup in my message to you in the hope
<br>
that it becomes clearer. Markup and pretty pictures can greatly enhance a
<br>
large body of work that is dominantly textual. In email we use other forms
<br>
of text markup, like &quot;&gt;&quot; for quoting, HTML encoding, _emphasis_ or *action*,
<br>
etc. These are all very important communication techniques that the sender
<br>
must use to try and communicate more clearly. I am suggesting that you add
<br>
more markup and diagrams to your papers to make them more &quot;readable&quot;.
<br>
<p>As for the implicit desire to &quot;win&quot;, or please as many people as possible
<br>
all the time, you need to either give up on that ideal given your current
<br>
writing skill, or learn what it is exactly that everyone wants that will
<br>
make them understand. If you don't have the skill yet, or you don't
<br>
understand what everyone wants, you must narrow down your target audience.
<br>
If your audience is current AI researchers, then learn their jargon and play
<br>
by the rules. If your audience is Extropians, same thing. If your audience
<br>
is me and others like me, then put more diagrams in to fill up those pages
<br>
of long, dense, jargon-rich and neologistic text.
<br>
<p>HTH.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon
