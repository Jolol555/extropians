</em><br>
<p>This is not in doubt. What is in doubt is that anthropogenic inputs are
<br>
increasing it outside the range typical of the last few million years.
<br>
In fact, ice core data from Antarctica directly contradicts the claims
<br>
of the chicken littles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; CO2 is a greenhouse gas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're pumping CO2, and other greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially in the case of coal, the CO2 was sequestered hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of years ago when (1) the sun was dimmer than today and (2) the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth was warmer than today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the basis for a default presumption that the Earth wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting warmer?
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that CO2 based warming is not a linear progression.
<br>
Warming from CO2 follows a diminishing returns curve at our atmospheric
<br>
pressure (note that Venus has over 90 Earth atmospheres, not to mention
<br>
is half the distance to the sun). As concentrations rise, the added
<br>
warming continues to decrease. CO2 is a very weak greenhouse gas
<br>
compared to others like methane and water, as well as sulfur oxides.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone else asked why we would want to keep the climate at a set point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if we weren't responsible for changing it.  Well, I like the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a good winter will kill a lot of insects and parasites.  Winter has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been called one of the larger contributions to northern public health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't want to go home to Chicago some day and get malaria.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it doesn't really, they just hybernate. Winter is also a detriment
<br>
to public health: it contributes to reductions in exercise and therefore
<br>
obesity, while it also contributes to seasonal affective disorders,
<br>
which cause increases in suicides and homicides. It increases vehicular
<br>
accident deaths and injuries as well as hypothermia induced deaths of
<br>
senior citizens on slim heating budgets (or manipulative offspring).
<br>
<p>Malaria itself is only symptomatic of unhealthy ecosystems. Properly
<br>
operating wetlands do not harbor malarial mosquitos, and with the recent
<br>
discovery of an effective remedy dating back to ancient egyptian texts,
<br>
I'm not too worried about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And with the 70 degree Decembers Chicago and Minneapolis have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having for the past few years, that might not be so unlikely.  The cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weather still breaks in by January, but the trend is rather alarming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a less alarmist view, there's all this coastal property to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flooded...
</em><br>
<p>Primarly flooded by gulf stream currents that would be more severe if
<br>
the poles were colder than they currently are. The fact is that alleged
<br>
warming in the northern hemisphere has greately reduced the number and
<br>
severity of cyclonic storms, reducing death tolls, property damage, and
<br>
coastal property losses. Three quarters of the most damaging hurricanes
<br>
to hit the US in the last century occured in the first half of that
<br>
century, NOT in the second half when all of the alleged warming occured.
