&gt; 
&gt; Online advertising company DoubleClick has phased out its Internet ad 
&gt; profiling service as
&gt; part of its shift from media services, proving consumer tracking 
&gt; doesn't always pay.
&gt; 
&gt; The New York-based company jettisoned its &quot;intelligent&quot; targeting 
&gt; service effective Dec.
&gt; 31, a company representative confirmed Tuesday. Launched in 2000, the 
&gt; product allowed
&gt; marketers to target ads based on a database of some 100 million 
&gt; profiles. The technology
&gt; tracked people online anonymously and then served ads based on 
&gt; personal tastes.
&gt; 
&gt; The company simply decided not to continue the product in 2002, 
&gt; according to the
&gt; representative.
&gt; 
&gt; But profiling largely failed to pan out the way DoubleClick hoped. 
&gt; Once heralded as the
&gt; key to online advertising's success, such tracking behavior quickly 
&gt; caused privacy
&gt; headaches for the company. In 2000, it came under fire from federal 
&gt; regulators and privacy
&gt; advocates for its practice of compiling dossiers on consumers. 
&gt; Sources said DoubleClick
&gt; has long struggled to find customers for its profiling products 
&gt; because of ongoing privacy
&gt; concerns in the industry.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, with the dot-com collapse, the company had trouble selling 
&gt; higher-priced ads on its
&gt; network because they often came with minimal benefits, analysts say.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The lift you get from that kind of profiling just isn't enough to 
&gt; pay all that extra data
&gt; storage and process costs,&quot; said Jim Nail, an advertising analyst at 
&gt; Forrester Research.
&gt; 
&gt; In the last 16 months, DoubleClick has worked to deflect its 
&gt; dependence on the sickly
&gt; advertising market. It has built up its research, data and technology 
&gt; divisions while
&gt; slowly dismantling its media division.
&gt; 
&gt; In November, the head of DoubleClick's media division, Barry Salzman, 
&gt; resigned. The
&gt; company also sold its European media division and said it was 
&gt; considering options for the
&gt; U.S. media arm. Sealing the company's bent toward technology, David 
&gt; Rosenblatt, the
&gt; company's former technology chief, became president in late December.
&gt; 
&gt; The intelligent targeting product was originally launched under 
&gt; Abacus Online, a product
&gt; of DoubleClick's $1.7 billion merger with data-collection agency 
&gt; Abacus Direct. But the
&gt; company quietly dissolved the division in late 2000. Another division 
&gt; operated under
&gt; Abacus Online called PredictiveMail, a combined e-mail and 
&gt; direct-mail marketing service,
&gt; was folded into Abacus.
&gt; 
&gt; The company's previous plans to launch an anonymous profile service 
&gt; that matched online
&gt; and offline data was also scotched.
&gt; 
&gt; Nail said DoubleClick sold the targeted ads for a premium of $10 to 
&gt; $12 per thousand
&gt; impressions; random rotation on the DoubleClick network typically 
&gt; cost $3 per thousand.
&gt; Although the company promised targeted-ad results of 200 percent to 
&gt; 300 percent higher
&gt; than typical conversions--or the number of times a customer acted on 
&gt; an advertisement--the
&gt; costs were still too high for many marketers.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Even if you get a 300 percent lift, it isn't worth the added cost. 
&gt; It doesn't pay off,&quot;
&gt; Nail said.
