<em>&gt; Maybe. I think it is a very large probability that by the end of this

</em><br>
<p>Then you will be a posttranshumanist.
<br>
<p>I liked your post on what transhumanism is / is not. Thanks for taking the
<br>
time to write it.
<br>
<p>I have a couple of points to pick... 
<br>
- firstly, I think the argument about ruling out collectivism falls apart if
<br>
you have a purely voluntary collective. I think that the core values you
<br>
have put forward allow any type of social arrangement as long as it is
<br>
purely voluntary for all members. Is this actually workable?
<br>
<p>- Second, and more important, I think the discussion reduces transhumanism
<br>
to &quot;humanism with toys&quot;, and I suspect there is more to it than that. How is
<br>
the transhumanism that you have presented any different to plain vanilla
<br>
humanism?
