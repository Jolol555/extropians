<em>&gt;Subject: The Politics of Transhumanism
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Given the recent discussions of politics on this list, especially of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropianism as libertarian transhumanism, I invite list members to read my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recent essay on &quot;The Politics of Transhumanism.&quot; Thanks to comments from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Natasha and Max I've cleaned up a couple of factual errors. I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appreciate your comments as well as I'm preparing it for submission for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;publication.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm">http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Abstract:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Contemporary transhumanism has grown out of white, male, affluent, American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet culture, and its political perspective has generally been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;militant version of the libertarianism typical of that culture. Nonetheless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanists are becoming more diverse, with some building a broad
</em><br>
liberal
<br>
<em>&gt;democratic philosophic foundation in the World Transhumanist Association.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The essay also discusses the emergence of neo-Nazi and radical democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism.  For transhumanism to achieve its goals it needs to distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself from its anarcho-capitalist roots and its authoritarian mutations by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clarifying its commitments to liberal democratic institutions, values and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public policies. By embracing political engagement and the use of
</em><br>
government
<br>
<em>&gt;to address equity, safety and efficacy concerns about transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologies, transhumanists are in a better position to attract a larger,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broader audience.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Thanks for your eyeball time
</em><br>

<p>Hi fellow humanoids,
<br>
<p>I agree with the last sentence ... but have a question whether by &quot;
<br>
political engagement&quot; you agree with me that 'post-human' groups
<br>
(including various sub-sets) should contest elections, or whether you
<br>
just want to remain a lobby group?
<br>
<p>Of course, I believe &quot;trans-&quot; human period happened between
<br>
Industrial Revolution to date, and any efforts to promote transhumanism
<br>
are thus at best pointless, and at worst regressive.
<br>
<p>I also disagree with your &quot;American&quot;
<br>
comment ... aren't you aware of various Euro-groups and UK-based
<br>
post-human movement that has been around since the 1980's? The
<br>
difference between US &amp; Euro groups seems to reflect broader
<br>
cultures, e.g European radical futurists seem more &quot;green&quot; and alternative
<br>
technology leaning, whereas you are probably correct that US based
<br>
groups seem more anarcho&quot;capitalist&quot; and right-wing libertarian leaning.
<br>
<p>Is the point to &quot;attract an audience&quot; or to &quot;convert/ upgrade&quot; folks
<br>
to a post-human mindset? Any freak show can attract a wide
<br>
audience, look at self-proclaimed posthuman Marilyn Manson.
<br>
The human, legacy-condition world view seems to me like a
<br>
hypnotic torpor .... but since MVT and post-human philosophy
<br>
surely our aim should be to wake everyone up and upgrade their
<br>
&quot;mental operating systems&quot; (metaprograms in NLP) so as to
<br>
guide evolution in a favourable direction.
