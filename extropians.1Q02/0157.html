<p><em>&gt; Since I was on vacation, I wasn't able to speak up, so I'll do so now.  I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the market practices is a good thing.  There can be no progress if
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; means hiring overseas, it's the right thing to do.  The people fired in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wake of change are idle hands ready to work on the next thing to come
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; idle, and no one has work for you, be the someone yourself!)  It is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in societies that outlaw new enterprise that unemployment is a problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This would be nice to believe but to simply assert it seems a
<br>
bit, well, doctrinaire.  As I have asked many times here and
<br>
haven't really been answered, what happens when there is no
<br>
market due to automation and continually more sophisticated
<br>
technology, for anyone with less than a certain amount of
<br>
general intelligence and a fair amount of training?  It is not
<br>
at all clear to me that there will always be a market for
<br>
everyone to find a job in just because the society has free
<br>
markets.  It is also not clear to me that having a &quot;job&quot; is the
<br>
best and only reasonable way that citizens may be productive or
<br>
that they have access to a reasonable level of compfort and
<br>
freedom to pursue their happiness.  The &quot;job&quot; paradigm may be
<br>
increasingly obsolete as may be some old economic models based
<br>
in more scarcity and less high technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think national boundaries should matter for trade or for jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The current pragmatics are that our welfare laws make it tough to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlimited entry.  The recent terrorist acts, and the continuing concern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about further acts have provided an opening for those who believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glorifying artificial boundaries.  I think we should be very careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing these concerns to push us too far from our long-standing policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open borders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Some here have argued that we need to make sure that those who enter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already hold beliefs consistent with our trusting society.  I will only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concede on the point of those who want to come here to perpetrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence.  Other than that, I'd welcome any who want to work, to raise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children, or to get an education.  Whatever they're looking for is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available only as part of a bundle that will entice them or their children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into buying the package.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Also agreed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; They don't come here (other than the terrorists) in order to find a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfortable version of home.  If they come for a living wage, they'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find they have to live and work among a diversity of people.  If they
</em><br>
<p>Not so clear because of the above.  Increasingly it may not be
<br>
economically feasible to hire and train people in many
<br>
companies, at least not people below a certain intelligence and
<br>
level of training.  What then for these people who are no longer
<br>
hirable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for an education, they'll have to work to make it.  When they start a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family, they'll yearn for the same comforts for their children as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of us, and work as hard as it takes to make it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Personally, I still think the US can do a lot worse than provide
<br>
some reasonable stipend in the form of a grant (say 12,000/yr)
<br>
to every capable adult who wishes to continue his/her
<br>
education.   The need is great to get a more educated population
<br>
and workforce and we can't wait for &quot;trickle-down&quot; to have it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Only the most clueless of Singularity gradualists, in severe hard takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; denial, could even begin to imagine that the Singularity was an argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for Social Darwinism [...]  If the value of the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world is a quadrillion dollars, and a quintillion dollars of new wealth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; created by an egalitarian superintelligence, the previous distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wealth becomes irrelevant.  [...]  We win together, or lose together.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are all in the same boat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I kept trying to figure out what I disagreed with about this.  I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a &quot;Singularity gradualist, in severe hard takeoff denial.&quot;  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up thinking that the argument is stronger from a gradualist perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The statistics (according to Julian Simon, of course) show that in most
</em><br>
<p>?  I am not altogether sure I can trust Julian Simon for such
<br>
statistics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; cases, as technology advances, the rich do keep getting richer, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gap keeps getting proportionately smaller.  Those who worry about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have-nots, when they have statistics always show the ones that show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some people are still behind, and don't check to see whether they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catching up.  We can argue about gradualism again, but since we agree on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outcome, there's no need to do so here.
</em><br>
<p>I do not find the above tenable.  Especially not now when even a
<br>
lot of very highly trained and motivated friends of mine are out
<br>
of work and have been for months.  Our system is not working all
<br>
that smoothly right now.  And I would also question relative
<br>
purchase power figures when it takes two wage earners in more
<br>
and more households today to just break reasonably even, even
<br>
without a lot of consumerist over-spending, than it did in my
<br>
parent's generation.  It also takes longer in many parts of the
<br>
country and is accessible to fewer levels of income, to own a
<br>
home of one's own.  
<br>
<p>Now all of this may be moot in the event of a hard take-off
<br>
soon.  But there is a little problem in maximizing our human
<br>
lives and resources of brains and talents in order to get to
<br>
take-off whether it comes soon or later and is gradual or sharp.

<p>Generally I agree with some serious caveats for various

&quot;intellectual property&quot; rights issues and issues about what is

best organized as a commons rather than as property in order to

produce the most benefit to us all.
