=============================================================
<br>
-If there is no Singularity within, say, 100 years, no successful recoveries 
<br>
of the cryonically suspended, no sucessful memory upload to clones, no FTL or 
<br>
relativistic space travel, then this article does have considerable meaning.

<br>
&quot;Magic number&quot; for space pioneers calculated 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
The &quot;magic number&quot; of people needed to create a viable population for 
<br>
multi-generational space travel has been calculated by researchers. It is 
<br>
about the size of a small village - 160. But with some social engineering it 
<br>
might even be possible to halve this to 80.
<br>
<p>Anthropologist John Moore from University of Florida tackled the problem as 
<br>
part of a combined effort with space scientists to determine how in future 
<br>
humans might successfully undertake century-long journeys out into space. 
<br>
<p>In the past, attention has been focused on cryogenics, sperm banks and 
<br>
military-style modes of operation, says Moore, but &quot;the 'right stuff' for a 
<br>
journey into space is the family - a million-year-old institution designed to 
<br>
assist reproduction.&quot;
<br>
<p>Moore has previously studied small migrating populations of early humans and 
<br>
has developed simulation software - called Ethnopop - for analysing the 
<br>
viability of small groups. 
<br>
<p><p>Marriage partners 
<br>
<p><p>For a space trip of 200 years, perhaps eight to 10 generations, his 
<br>
calculations suggest a minimum number of 160 people are needed to maintain a 
<br>
stable population. 
<br>
<p>This would produce around 10 potential marriage partners per person, he says, 
<br>
and if this seems a small number, &quot;think about how many people you dated 
<br>
before you got married&quot;.
<br>
<p>Room would be at a premium on any spacecraft and reducing the number of 
<br>
people initially required might be desirable. Moore suggests two strategies. 
<br>
The first is to begin with young childless couples, echoing the practice of 
<br>
Polynesian seafaring colonists.
<br>
<p>The second is to ask the space crew to postpone reproduction to later in 
<br>
woman's fertile period, perhaps age 35 to 40, creating longer time gaps 
<br>
between the generations. This measure results in a stable population of just 
<br>
80 but the consequences of the increased medical risks of late childbirth 
<br>
have not yet been considered.
<br>
<p>A potential concern is that small populations can suffer a damaging reduction 
<br>
in genetic diversity due to inbreeding, says Dennis O'Rourke from the 
<br>
University of Utah. He considered the same 10-generation, 200-year journey as 
<br>
Moore and looked at both genetic drift and inbreeding.
<br>
<p>&quot;The decrease in genetic variation is actually quite small and less than 
<br>
found in some successful small populations on Earth,&quot; he says. &quot;It would not 
<br>
be a significant factor as long as the space travellers come home or interact 
<br>
with other humans at the end of the 200 year period.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Gene screening 
<br>
<p><p>O'Rourke believes that a more serious concern would be the presence of 
<br>
potentially damaging genotypes in the initial space pioneers. Genetic 
<br>
screening might well be needed, he says: &quot;Any harmful recessive 
<br>
characteristics might lead to increased healthcare loads which would deplete 
<br>
scarce resources.&quot;
<br>
<p>A final concern raised at the American Association for the Advancement of 
<br>
Science's annual meeting in Boston was the possibility of infighting. Small 
<br>
communities isolated for long periods at research stations in Antarctic and 
<br>
even families travelling on long car journeys, provide examples of how small 
<br>
conflicts can quickly escalate.
<br>
<p>But Moore points out: &quot;Some small island communities on Earth have lived in 
<br>
peace and harmony for thousands of years because they have developed ways of 
<br>
solving conflicts. These are not taken to Antarctica.&quot;
