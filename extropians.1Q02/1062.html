<em>&gt; &gt; discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've not read Pournelle's, but I have read Steve Stirling's (a guilty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pleasure of mine).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The first and second books take place in this alternate world's version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WWII and its aftermath. The third and fourth books actually deal somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seriously with some of the themes of transhumanism.  By the third book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Draka have have conquered half the world, and remade it in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;image...a world in which the chattel slavery of the American South
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embraces the industrial revolution; imagine Henry Ford able to buy his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workers on the auction block rather than having to pay them ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;escalating wages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Draka elite actually realize that they have painted themselves into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corner.  Their model of society, while workable (barely) in a growing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heavy industrial society, cannot in the long run compete with with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growing information economy of the West.  They must conquer the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world, while they still retain the capacity.  Furthermore, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realize that they will always be threatened by their own slaves, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politically divide into two factions over this.  One faction favors (after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the conquest allows them the luxury) a gradual liberalization, granting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more freedom to the slave class over time.  The other, whose work has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already begun with the birth of the first of the New Race, favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetically engineering the Master Race, and just as importantly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engineering of a slave race designed to be dominated and like it.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hate and fear the liberals, and the liberals fear the the human race will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be engineered into termites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is an interesting depiction of essentially *choosing*, for non-rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideological reasons, the sort of society you want, and then going about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engineering people to fit that preconception.  I suppose the commies would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create Socialist Man, and the Nazi's something like the Draka.  What sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people would libertarians create?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No brave free normals defeat the Draka; they win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The fourth book is set about 400 years later (and on present day Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our own alternate timeline), and depicts the engineered Final Society, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well as the technologically advanced decendants of the the handful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;escape the conquest of the Earth in the first starship. The Draka focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological technology, the Samothracians on computer technology and eschew
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biotech (at least the permanent kind the Draka have).  There is handwaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about how strong AI is impossible and how Moore's law plateus early to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keep the characters recognisably human.  There also are limits to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetic engineering of the Draka...a sort of Campbellian trade-off between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agressive domination and creativity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the interstellar cold war, the Samothracian's face an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dilemma:  suppose they did eventually defeat the Draka...what do they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the slaves?  They are breed to be docile and obedient, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stupid.  They would just go about recreating their old masters, but how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can you justify exterminating them (the Samothracians are suppose to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the good guys, after all).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not the greatest books in the world, and many have trouble suspending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disbelief (the Draka seem to get *all* the breaks, and the tech advances a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit faster than believable so the Final War can take place at the close of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Millenium), but an interesting challange to the notion that the good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guys always win, and a warning that the future can still turn out to be &quot;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boot stomping on a human face, forever&quot;...particularly when techology can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be used to change the game completely.

</em><br>
<p>I recently read the first three books, and I'd only like to add that their 
<br>
technological progress is limited because they never switched to Von 
<br>
Neumann architecture, everything is hardwired.  Oh, and I also found the 
<br>
success of the Draka and the quicker technological progress stretching my 
<br>
credulity a little, but I think the increased development of Africa in that 
<br>
time line could reasonably account for some of the more advanced technology.
