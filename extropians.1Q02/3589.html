<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I realise this sounds gruesome to many people, but it would

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;definitely result in increased organ availability. It would be difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Does it get us generally closer to the type of world we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wish/need  to live in?  It doesn't look much like what my goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is.  On the one hand it is ghastly unpleasant and subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;tons of abuse.  On the other hand I wonder how much worse it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to sell all of one's hopes, dreams, ambitions, talent and

<em>&gt;&gt;productive time to merely eat and pay the rent while never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;claiming one's own dreams.  Selling a kidney seems almost clean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in comparison. If a person can choose one questionable trade-off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;freely then why not the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is the whole point of capitalism- choice.  People are more likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the higher payoff, but always some people will make choices most people see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as questionable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question is, does anyone have a right to prevent people from making bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>The implication is that all people are capable of making a fair 
<br>
choice.  Seeing what seems to sell whatever the TV ads are for I 
<br>
have a very difficult time thinking that most of the people out 
<br>
there are capable of such fair choice.  We've bred it out of 'em.
<br>
<p>I assume that at the least only adults can sell an organ and 
<br>
then only their own.  No parting out your children and relations.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; (1) banning trade in organs violates your right to own your own body.
</em><br>
<p><p>Not necessarily.  It might keep someone else from talking you 
<br>
out of some of your body.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) legalizing organ trade would result in greater organ supply and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decreasing mortality rates for many diseases.
</em><br>
<p><p>An increasing rates for those that have sold off too much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (3) families of dead people would be better off, especially people who now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot afford a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper funeral.
</em><br>
<p><p>People can set up to donate organs when they die already.  What 
<br>
is with letting the relatives change your decision or lack of 
<br>
same when you die?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; (4) you could make extra cash by selling blood, skin, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>As someone who has lived on the street at one time and was once 
<br>
desperate enough to sell whole blood for the pittance to get off 
<br>
the street for a night, this is not a great argument.  And it is 
<br>
only one step removed from a creditor suggesting (more forcibly 
<br>
if the creditor is a loan shark) that you sell off a part to 
<br>
clear your debt.  No thanks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The only disadvantage I can see is organ smuggling, which is rumoured to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur currently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An open market would probably incrrease supply to the point where such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gruesome possibilities would be uneconomic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>The possible downsides are many, some of which I alluded to above.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Except in situations of unequal power and wealth the selfishness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of the more powerful will, other things being equal, swam the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;self-interest of the weaker.  If people can be coerced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;persuaded to do and go along with some of the stupid things of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;today then I find it very hard to believe that many could not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;persuaded to part with an organ even if it was not, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;reasonably objective analysis, in their interests.  If that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;so then granting such trade legal status would legalize a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;nightmare with serious moral and health repurcussions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are few organs which can be taken from live bodies, and enough people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die that market forces would result in demand satisfied by dead peoples
</em><br>
<p><p>They include things like one kidney and one lung unfortunately. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows what future medicine can make use of?  Of 
<br>
course in a generation or two I expect medical nanotech (if 
<br>
Singularity hasn't taken us sooner) to make all of this moot anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; organs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I have too much faith in peoples intelligence, but I really cannot see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving up, say, a healthy cornea, given that the number of dead people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organs to their families to sell would drive prices down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Then you have a lack of imagination and much too high of an 
<br>
opinion of the majority's intelligence.  Also you underestimate 
<br>
what a desperate person might consider, especially when young 
<br>
enough to make a foolish decision or two too many.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I cant see a down side to legalizing organ trade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your concerns sound vaguely paranoid, but are unfortunately shared by most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it unlikely that organ trade will occur in the near future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>If you can't see a down side then you aren't looking.  Don't 
<br>
call me paranoid when I am simply telling you what I've seen in 
<br>
the world and logical extrapolation from it.  This one strikes 
<br>
me as a very questionable idea and one likely to generate a lot 
<br>
of problems.  I much rather see us clone replacement parts 
<br>
directly, which we aren't that far from, while we await medical NT.
