<em>&gt; But how do you keep the game going as you want it to if no one is playing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the rules?
</em><br>
<p>By building the laws into the physics of the universe, you make it
<br>
impossible to break them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What distinguishes the game from being the real world?
</em><br>
<p>The distinction is becoming less clear every day, isn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where is the benefit of playing a virtual world if in fact it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable from the real world?
</em><br>
<p>A libertarian world wouldn't be that hard to distinguish from the real
<br>
world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm having trouble understanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your point.  On the one hand, you suggest creating a game that supports a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lib viewpoint, on the other hand you say if doesn't matter if the players 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore that viewpoint and act against it.
</em><br>
<p>That's what libertarianism is all about: letting people do what they
<br>
want. It's not about forcing everyone to think the same way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...On the other hand, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you abandon the lib VN concept, one could create a VN with large numbers of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players IF there was a hook (such as sex) to draw them in in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>The trouble with peddling sex online is that it raises all sorts of
<br>
real world legal issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Libertarian Party has been trying for thirty years to build its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strength.  They have probably no more than 30,000 members - out of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national population of 300 million.  And it took them thirty years to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that - an average of 1,000 members a year.  And these are relatively hard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core libs.  You'll never get 300,000 libs into a VN at that rate.
</em><br>
<p>I think the idea is to plant a seed and hope that it grows into
<br>
something bigger, demonstrating the virtues of libertarianism and
<br>
exposing people to libertarian ideas in action and hopefully
<br>
converting some in the process. Marketing it as &quot;Libertopia&quot; would be
<br>
a big mistake, I think, because libertarianism isn't on most people's
<br>
radar, and most of those familiar with it have already decided whether
<br>
they like the idea or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you drop the political stance, however, the question arises:  what will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the VN look like?
</em><br>
<p>If you give people art supplies, what will their artwork look like?
<br>
Who knows?
<br>
<p>The control that the operators of existing games exercise gives the
<br>
games a distinctive look and feel, but it also makes the worlds
<br>
predictable and boring. Personal interactions are still pretty
<br>
uncontrolled, and therefore unpredictable and interesting. A
<br>
libertarian world would be orders of magnitude more unpredictable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If sex - or anything else - doesn't need to be put in the game, then what's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of the game?  I'm trying to pin down what this game is supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do besides waste time in imaginary pursuits.  On the one hand, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest all sorts of benefits - on the other, you say these things already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go on without the game.  So why play the game?
</em><br>
<p>People play games because they enjoy it. I'd play because I'd like to
<br>
see how libertarianism would work in action--even if it's &quot;just a
<br>
game&quot;. It'd also help me understand libertarianism better, which would
<br>
probably make me more effective at spreading the idea to others,
<br>
especially those who don't play the game.
