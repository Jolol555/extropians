<em>&gt; The FACT of the matter is that you cannot force an addict/alcoholic to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clean. Nothing in existence can keep the afflicted from that next hit or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drink or whatever EXCEPT their own free will to *choose* to stop. S/He
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; require assisstance (sometimes a great deal) to carry out this choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely, but the *choice* by necessity must be freely &amp; willingly made
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; the addict of his/her own accord.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I've had a dilemma about this subject for some time. My views are based on
<br>
both my own experience and that of others, both socially and in research.
<br>
Feel free to disagree with me completely, I am merely seeking answers to
<br>
unsolved problems, which is what research is all about, and this group
<br>
excels at bouncing problems back and forth and often finding solutions...I
<br>
don't want to make anyone uncomfortable though, so if you don't want to talk
<br>
about drugs, stop reading now.
<br>
I find it curious that in our society, distinctions are made between
<br>
'drugs', as in illegal or other substances that people get addicted to,
<br>
'drugs' that people get from doctors or chemists, and 'drugs' such as sugar,
<br>
coffee and junk food.
<br>
All of these categories of drugs affect the mind, and the behaviour,
<br>
profoundly. Sugar and junk food have as strong a link with delinquent crime
<br>
as alcohol or amphetamines. The side-effects of regular use of Ibuprofen,
<br>
Valium or Chloramphenicol are just as serious as those of tobacco, and worse
<br>
than marijuana.
<br>
(That was a qualifier...)
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
&nbsp;Not all junkies *want* to get sober &amp; my feeling
<br>
<em>&gt; is that if they don't want to put in the effort when given the
</em><br>
opportunity,
<br>
<em>&gt; then they are fucking themselves. The State need not waste money or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources on people who continue to make the *choice* to use.
</em><br>
<p>There is a possibility that this could be totally unfair...
<br>
If someone suffers from depression, and they find a drug which relieves the
<br>
symptoms, they are going to use it, because from their point of view they
<br>
feel more responsible, capable and, bluntly, sane when they use the drug
<br>
than when they do not. And which is preferable -a nervous, depressed,
<br>
irritable person driving the family car, or a person under the influence of
<br>
a drug that makes them feel sane and happy?
<br>
My point is, I believe that many 'addicts' who choose not to stop are
<br>
self-medicating to relieve an unbearable mental state. Many are doing this
<br>
legally, with Prozac, Valium, tobacco or chocolate. They know the substance
<br>
is damaging their body and creating social problems. But in just the same
<br>
way that the side-effects of pain-killers are still preferable to acute
<br>
pain, the social and physical side-effects of addiction seem better than
<br>
acute psychological torment.
<br>
I will stick my neck out here and say that I believe any addict who chooses
<br>
to continue is probably in this position.
<br>
When I say 'psychological torment' I'm not referring to the effects of
<br>
withdrawal. I mean the person was in psychological torment before they ever
<br>
took the drug, and took it in the first place because they were looking for
<br>
relief from that torment. They probably tried several drugs before finding
<br>
one that worked. And the symptoms will return, and remain indefinitely, if
<br>
the drug is stopped. So by asking addicts to stop we could be doing the
<br>
equivalent of taking away the Prozac from someone with deep depression, or
<br>
the Chlorpromazine from someone with schizophrenia.
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
&nbsp;In fact, accepting responsibility for ones own actions, (past,
<br>
<em>&gt; present, &amp; future) is literally the first step in treatment of addiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Addicts cannot get sober without first taking full responsibility for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves &amp; their condition.
</em><br>
<p>Which condition? The addiction or the condition which caused it? Should we
<br>
assume responsibility for our own genetically inherited diseases, our
<br>
neurological / neurochemical imbalances / disorders or our viral infections?
<br>
We don't get sick on purpose. We don't get psychologically distressed or
<br>
depressed on purpose. Is a drug user guilty for taking medication with bad
<br>
side-effects, if nobody is providing anything better?
<br>
Why would anybody who is 100% mentally healthy ever choose to put anything
<br>
into their bodies if it didn't, overall, make them feel better? How many
<br>
people are out tonight searching for anything that will?
<br>
Psychoses and neuroses do not always respond to drugs from a doctor. An
<br>
individual's mind, and neurochemistry, is unique. Sometimes, chocolate or
<br>
tobacco or marijuana will do the trick. Should we, then, take this away from
<br>
them, or make them feel guilty for doing it?
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
If a person chooses to diminish their lives
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by using some drugs, then they have every right to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;All drug use carries a risk, and the risks are varied. As an adult,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;each makes his/her own decision as to whether to expose themself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that drug, and one measures the potential good/harm against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;own personal form of measure.
</em><br>
<p>On the physical damage side, depression itself increases the possibility of
<br>
so many diseases / disorders, there is not enough time or room here to list
<br>
them. It is definitely worse for you physically than smoking anything (and
<br>
pretty nasty for your loved ones, too).
<br>
What we should be doing is assessing why people need drugs (any drugs) and
<br>
providing the safest drugs possible to relieve the symptoms each person
<br>
suffers when s/he is 'straight'. This is what doctors try to do, although,
<br>
with a patient, the illness is already recognised. Perhaps the biggest
<br>
question should be why such a large percentage of the population suffers
<br>
from mild-to-middling psychological disorders? There may be a clue to this
<br>
in those organisations which succeed in 'curing' addicts -perhaps what they
<br>
are actually doing is curing the underlying disorder, by showing the person
<br>
that someone cares and giving them a bit of self-esteem, with the love,
<br>
respect, affection and attention they maybe never got from parents, friends
<br>
or partners, and the lack of which caused the depression in the first place?
<br>
Human beings need to be nurtured throughout growth to be mentally healthy,
<br>
to avoid insecurity and fear of abandonment.
<br>
Insecurity=fear=anxiety=depression in a lot of cases. How many people do you
<br>
know who are 100% sane? (Well, the people on this list, of course! )
<br>
As for the state, my point of view makes its interference obsolete. If any
<br>
person has to take any kind of medication to relieve any kind of symptoms,
<br>
and that medication affects their behaviour and/or performance, then they
<br>
should be monitored by their GP and assessed for their ability to drive or
<br>
operate machinery. They may need to register as disabled until a safer
<br>
medication can be found or a cure is forthcoming. But without such a cure,
<br>
expecting anyone to give up their medication and just suffer is perhaps a
<br>
bit barbaric?
<br>
The state would, of course, have to trash all the drugs laws and hand the
<br>
control of substances over to the drugs companies &amp; manufacturers. So a
<br>
heroin manufacturer would have to pay taxes on that, and users would pick
<br>
their supply up on prescription. Same for tobacco. And I reckon a lot more
<br>
people would go for therapy / treatment than could be bothered to get their
<br>
cigarettes on script every month...although if it were thought of as a
<br>
medication, it would be more popular in tablets -who on earth would smoke
<br>
it?
<br>
It wouldn't be too long before the real problem was addressed, if the
<br>
emphasis was on creating safer and safer medication for each individual.
<br>
Finally, a personal view; I drink alcohol copiously whenever I am with
<br>
people socially whom I do not know very well. I do this on purpose because
<br>
otherwise I can't think of anything to say, and I feel awkward, embarrassed,
<br>
geeky and shy. When they are gone, I stop, and I don't think about drinking
<br>
again until I'm in that situation again, just as I wouldn't dream of taking
<br>
a painkiller if I wasn't in pain.  What if I felt like that with everyone,
<br>
even my family, all the time, unless I drank all the time?  What if I felt
<br>
utterly depressed unless I constantly took something which made me feel
<br>
better but made me behave like an asshole? Would I do it?
<br>
I honestly do not know.
