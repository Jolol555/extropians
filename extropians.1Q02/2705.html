<em>&gt; They have every right to do so, ONLY if the only negative impact is upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their lives alone. If there are dependents involved, who have their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights to be free of such irresponsibility, or even just creditors, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a right to expect their money to be treated responsibly, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual engaging in such behavior is putting jeopardy on others, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just themselves, and in a libertarian perspective, the interests of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others put in jeopardy are equally as important as that of the drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; user.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you advocating that an addict has a greater right to get high and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive their kids off a cliff than their kids have to continue living?
</em><br>
<p>I can't speak toward your personal experience, Mike, or for Amara's,
<br>
but I, for one, refuse to concede that there's no such thing as a
<br>
responsible drug user.  Yes, drug abuse can lead to actual crime
<br>
against others, and those crimes should be prosecuted, but rational
<br>
people don't make the mistake of confusing the instrument with the
<br>
crime: that's the same argument of the gun-banners.
<br>
<p>And further, while forfeiture cases may seem justified on criminal
<br>
drug-abuse grounds, the reality of the law and its present application
<br>
is that they are simply government theft of private property without due
<br>
process.  No conviction--or even formal accusation--of any crime is
<br>
necessary for a forfeiture.  Due process and the rights of the accused
<br>
don't apply, because no person is being accused: the property itself is
<br>
being accused (the court cases have wonderful titles like &quot;U.S. vs. 100
<br>
Bottles of Wine&quot;)  Anyone who supports such forfeiture laws is no
<br>
libertarian, regardless of the pretext used to justify them.
