<p>Yes, you should be very careful with that prediction. it was arbitrary:
<br>
In 1996 I predicted that the singularity would happen within ten years.
<br>
<p>I still believe that I was correct, and as far as I can tell, everybody
<br>
else who has made a prediction and subsequently changed it has opted for
<br>
an earlier date, so the locus of predictions is moving closer to my date.
<br>
<p>However, if you accept the concept that the singularity is driven by
<br>
exponential change, then you must realize that the actual data will not 
<br>
become obvious to most people until the singularity is nearly upon us.
<br>
<p><p>If you prefer the &quot;phase change&quot; model, then the situation is even 
<br>
worse. In this model, we have built a substrate that provides the
<br>
resources needed to create an SI, needing only some single breakthrough
<br>
to bring it into existence. With this model, the SI can be brought into
<br>
existence without warning by an individual or a small group .As the 
<br>
substrate improves, The size of the needed breakthrough decreases.
<br>
I feel that the substrate is already very rich and is rapidly getting 
<br>
richer, as measured in available computing capacity.
<br>
<p>Conclusion: 2006 is a guess, but it is not completely ridiculous.
