<em>&gt; &quot;WHich is all rather BS. I'll buy that Starfleet operates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communistically, much as many military organizations do today to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited extent...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     -----------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you check out the site, he addresses things like the Abolition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights, State seizure of transportation services, State seizure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication services, Elimination of religion and traditional families,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State seizure of industry, Citizens are forced to work.  Just some examples:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No wealth: Counsellor Troi and Captain Picard have both boasted about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the accumulation of wealth is no longer an incentive. What they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain is why. Humans have always been territorial (and so have our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary ancestors), so our desire to accumulate more assets seems more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a basic facet of human nature than a temporary cultural phenomenon. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be suppressed or modified through education and social conditioning, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such methods are hardly 100% effective. Some greedy people should remain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not in Star Trek. So if humans in the future no longer desire wealth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then why not? Do they use extremely advanced brainwashing techniques, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated that no one can resist them? Or have they made the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulation of wealth illegal, as Marx advocated? The latter seems more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible.
</em><br>
<p>No, it doesn't. The advent of replicator technology has eliminated the
<br>
drive for fulfillment of basic needs through labor. Furthermore, the
<br>
federation citizens you generally only see in TNG are Starfleet
<br>
officers, trained at Starfleet Academy. These are scientists whose every
<br>
need is supplied by Starfleet from the moment of their induction. If
<br>
they need personal items, they are replicated, so the concept of 'cost'
<br>
for personal items and consumables is obsolete.
<br>
<p>However, it is far more telling to watch the future life of the TNG
<br>
teleport officer, who is a non-commissioned officer, who worked his way
<br>
up through the ranks, and later works at Deep Space Nine, where we see
<br>
his wife and child on a regular basis. There are a number of
<br>
conversations about whether they can 'afford' certain perks, like
<br>
vacations, as well as paying for the damages incured by their child's
<br>
pranks with his Ferengi friends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; US Navy ships are even more so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're all company cars: What was the last time you saw a privately owned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal starship? Starships are either government warships, diplomatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vessels, or transports. The only one-person vehicles (apart from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-Federation vehicles such as Quark's ship or Bajor's spacecraft) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runabouts and shuttles, and they are always government property. Some might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that starships must be very expensive or difficult to operate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore impractical for personal use, but Quark's ship disproved this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and Quark is a Ferengi, and the Ferengi ARE part of the Federation,
<br>
ergo there IS private ownership of starships.
<br>
Furthermore, what of the Maqui? Their ships are all privately owned,
<br>
converted from privately owned freighters, yachts, or transports, and
<br>
they were all formerly in the jurisdiction of the Federation.
<br>
<p>Now, you may claim: but any world that joins the Federation must adopt
<br>
communism. This claim is directly contradicted by the Prime Directive.
<br>
Individual worlds are free to develop as they wish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ma Bell is back: The entire subspace relay system is owned by the Federation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, as described in the DS9 tech manual. There is no private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitor. Since all interstellar communications must use this relay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network, this effectively gives the Federation government total control over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long distance communications. Furthermore, it appears that local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications systems are government-operated as well, since the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was able to effortlessly impose a complete local news blackout during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempted coup in &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; As another monopolistic Microsoftian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure, all communications start and end with the ubiquitous Federation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logo, even on mixed civilian/military stations like DS9. Quark once ran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afoul of this monopoly when he wanted to broadcast advertisements for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bar, and had no alternative but to break into DS9's communications system.
</em><br>
<p>Deep Space Nine is located in Bajoran space, which is treated as a DMZ
<br>
or UN Protectorate equivalent following the Cardassian War. Furthermore,
<br>
it is a station that is owned by the Federation, so it is obvious that
<br>
they would control their own communications systems. You only see the
<br>
federation logo on comm screens because the only comm screens you ever
<br>
see are federation owned screens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietszche Wins- God is Dead: While the TOS episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot; began
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a wedding in the ship's chapel, no TNG era ship seems to have a chapel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all. Christianity appears to have been purged from society. One of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most extreme examples of this deliberate suppression can be seen in a recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; episode of Voyager, the holographic Doctor actually portrayed a Catholic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priest and conducted a ceremony, but somehow avoided mentioning the names
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Jesus&quot; entirely! How someone can portray a priest and avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioning God or Jesus is beyond me. Also, while &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned Jesus and God, we never hear the name &quot;Jesus&quot; on TNG, DS9, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Voyager. This situation exists in stark contrast to every other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization, such as the Bajorans, Klingons, Ferengi etc. which all have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own curious religions (always precisely one religion per species; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess aliens aren't very imaginative in Star Trek).
</em><br>
<p>Note that Picard's brother makes a number of references to God. That
<br>
being said, it is possible that the public exposure of the Q culture
<br>
likely contributes to significant doubt (as well as the result of
<br>
ST:TFF, where 'God' is a bully).
<br>
<p>Actually, there have been heretical religions in several cultures (note
<br>
the heretical Klingons encountered by Voyager who thought B'lanna
<br>
Torres' unborn child was their savior.
<br>
<p>Now, lets say that God has either been proven to be non-existent, or
<br>
else federation technology has allowed private individuals to have a
<br>
direct comm line with the universes sysop. In either case, chapels would
<br>
be unnecessary, but what, exactly, does this have to do with capitalism?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He also gives qualitative estimates of how fully these various things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented (not all are 100%)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;A Captain living in the world of Starfleet would have little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money if all of his/her needs were met by the starfleet replicator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology. However, we rarely see in Star Trek anyone who isn't in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Starfleet who ISN'T engaged in private enterprise.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      -----------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He was referring to the federation specifically, how often do you see any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member race of the federation engaged in private enterprise?
</em><br>
<p>Rarely do you meet anyone who is not wholly starfleet or otherwise
<br>
employed in a government position. Tell me, how many people do you think
<br>
would be found in a drama set aboard the aircraft carrier Enterprise who
<br>
were not either military or government personnel? You might see some
<br>
when the ship is in port, but how many times do you see that? In such
<br>
cases, you always see private individuals who are either scientists,
<br>
contractors, or other business people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;Most of all, what is the point of naming the flagship of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fleet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Enterprise&quot; if it is a communist society?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the writers were merely idealistic english majors who had no concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of economics or physics, and catered to the Whim's of roddenberry and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; berman.  Just cause the ship is named 'Enterprise' does not mean that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federation supports free enterprise.
</em><br>
<p>Hand waving.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;There are many incidents in Star Trek history of businessmen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; openly, even if some are depicted in a rather typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biased-Roddenberry fashion (Harry Mudd, of &quot;Troubles with Tribbles&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other episodes of ST:TOS featuring him, including the one with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beauty pills and dilithium miners, and the one where Harry meets his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent end at the hands of an android that appears as his ex wife....)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      --------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you check the site out, he starts off (at some point) by saying that TOE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was mostly a free enterprise system, and joked that there must have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of coup in the intervening years.
</em><br>
<p>Note that replicators did not exist in the TOE period, but did exist in
<br>
the TNG era, supporting my theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;In ST:TNG, Capt. Picard's brother owns his own vinyard in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; France, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he labored to keep &quot;in the family&quot; while Picard went off to the stars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, the Ferengi ARE a part of the Federation, even if they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked down on by snooty starfleet types.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      -------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting point, checking the database on his site I referenced above I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Season 4, Ep# 78: &quot;Family&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (looking out over the vineyards)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LOUIS: One man's idea of paradise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PICARD: Two men. Robert's. And my father's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LOUIS: Never did I know anyone less interested in grapes than you, Jean-Luc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PICARD: No, I was interested, Louis. And I was proud that my family helped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to preserve the traditions. But I did not feel bound by those traditions as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they seemed to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His comments on the episode are...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Culture: not once in the entire episode do we hear talk of sales, but we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear of traditions. It seems as if the Picard family vineyard exists simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to provide scenery for the local community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This isn't unprecedented in real life. In certain European countries, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farms are deliberately maintained despite economic unviability strictly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons of aesthetics, so that tourists will see the quaint &quot;old world&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrarian lifestyles they've read about in books.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you watch this episode you may notice that their agricultural techniques
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are strictly primitive: everything is done by hand, as it was done centuries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago. This contradicts the common Trekkie argument that the Picard farm is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof of capitalism in the Federation, since a capitalist farm would be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more profitable using modern technology (never mind the advanced technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would presumably have in four centuries).
</em><br>
<p>This is inaccurate. Note how farms in Japan still use primitive hand
<br>
labor, hand polishing apples while still on the tree, etc and as a
<br>
result command a far higher market price than mass produced American
<br>
products, even of the same species. Note that 'authentic' french
<br>
champagne produced using traditional methods commands higher prices than
<br>
mass produced American &quot;champagne&quot; which is produced by the same method,
<br>
but automated, though is not allowed to be called 'champagne'. Note also
<br>
the organic farming movement, which commands higher prices for its
<br>
produce than non'organic' produce.
<br>
<p>I would imagine that wine that is certified to be hand made by human
<br>
labor would command a very high price to certain snobs and luddite
<br>
types, who would look with distain on 'replicator food' as plebian and
<br>
possibly bad for you, as many modern luddites claim about BGH milk, Bt
<br>
corn, and golden rice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      -------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorry - &quot;Furthermore, in ST:DSN, there are numerous incidents of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; businesspeople, including the Ferengi Quark, who owns his own bar/casino
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the space station, as well as the Cardassian tailor, who owns his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shop.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are the Ferengi and the Cardassians actually MEMBERS of the Federation?
</em><br>
<p>The cited individuals live IN the federation, as resident aliens live IN
<br>
the US.
