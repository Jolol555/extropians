<p><p><em>&gt; At its core, all world wars have been over which is superior: lies

<p><p>Reason, science and technology are not fully adequate to deal

claim or implie that all truth is sole possessed by the above

trio.  At least through in a bit of philosophy.  And where did 
<br>
ethics, aesthetics and so on go?
<br>
<p>Perhaps the next war will be between those who want simple 
<br>
cut-and-dried pigeonholes of what is what and those who realize 
<br>
that the &quot;truth&quot; is more ambiguous, deeper and more wonderful 
<br>
than that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p><p>Uh huh.  No countries come to blows over honest and clearly 
<br>
expressed conflicts of interests?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In this faith versus reason war, you have various faiths: in god, in
