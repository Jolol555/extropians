<p><p>I'm a singulatarian, but not a true extropian. The payback times for

most libertarian changes to human society are too long, given a

near-term singularity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;If you prefer the &quot;phase change&quot; model, then the situation is even

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only smooth path I could envision for the singularity would
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You would have to be able to co-opt a significant amount of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth path.
</em><br>
<p><p>Correct. But Any programmer who is willing to break the rules can in 
<br>
fact co-opt these resources. There is an active underground that
<br>
discovers and publishes techniques for this. Thanks to Microsoft
<br>
there are a legion of vulnerable computers. At a guess, there are
<br>
more than 100 million accessible, exploitable computers. The trick is
<br>
to discover the computers covertly in one pass, and then grab them and
<br>
start using them all at once, but still covertly. A well designed
<br>
replicating scanner would be essentially undetectable in the current
<br>
internet, which is filled with poorly-designed replicating scanners such
<br>
as &quot;code red.&quot;
<br>
<p>given this scheme, one could run 100 million instances of a massively 
<br>
parallel program designed to minimize required bandwidth.
<br>
<p>As you are probably aware, my guess is that AGI (Artificial General 
<br>
Intelligence) will not be created by normal human intelligence. Instead
<br>
Normal human programmers will create software that permits computers to 
<br>
augment human intelligence via human-computer collaboration. The 
<br>
resulting augmented humans will first enhance themselves and then 
<br>
program AGI.
