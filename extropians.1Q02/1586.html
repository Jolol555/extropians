</em><br>
<p>Actually Harvey it may be a little more complex.  An article I've read
<br>
suggests that the Enron CEO was buying stocks using loans from Enron
<br>
secured by Enron stock (not unusual for corporations).  You have to
<br>
remember Y2000 and early 2001 weren't very nice to many investors.
<br>
It looks like several of the significant investments the CEO had did
<br>
even worse than Enron.  As a result he was forced to provide additional
<br>
stock to pay down the loan to keep within the margin requirements.
<br>
[I think the NY Times was the source.]
<br>
<p>I don't think the SEC reports will be filed until next month, at which point
<br>
you can determine how much the CEO still owns in Enron stock.  I suspect
<br>
its still quite a significant chunk.  So I suspect he too has lost big time.
<br>
Now what will be interesting is how much of the compensation that was
<br>
handed out to the executives and the board over the last 5 years was
<br>
in cash vs. Enron stock.  Generally boards make a point of doing a
<br>
majority of the compensation in stock.  You can determine how much
<br>
of such stock was sold simply by looking at the SEC reports.
<br>
<p>If they believed their own house of cards and didn't sell, then they
<br>
were in the same boat as the employees.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They lied in their accounting.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't clear.  They were certainly setup to defer taxes.  And
<br>
they certainly were taking advantage of structures and very subtle
<br>
regulations that allowed off balance sheet activities.  But it isn't
<br>
clear the extent to which they &quot;lied&quot; vs. the structure they had
<br>
created (really -- I've seen reports of 800 to 3000 subsidiaries)
<br>
simply became so complex that accounting for it in a reliable fashion
<br>
would have been impossible!
<br>
<p>You have to ask the question as to whether the accountants statements
<br>
that the reports &quot;fairly reflected&quot; the companies position were accurate
<br>
if they didn't include footnotes like:
<br>
a) Enron currently owns 533 offshore subsidiaries whose primary purpose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is tax deferal.
<br>
<p>This is an accounting practices problem, not an executive management
<br>
problem.  Executive management are employed by the stockholders
<br>
to maximize profits.  Enron management did that.  Its the board
<br>
and accounting firm that are responsible for ensuring that they
<br>
are not stretching the rules so far they risk disaster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They destroyed evidence.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  However, it may not have been the CEO who was responsible.
<br>
I've heard statements on the news that Enron issued letters stating that
<br>
no documents were to be destroyed.  It might be the CFO (who I believe
<br>
came over from Arthur Anderson), or one of his subordinates who
<br>
setup the house of cards who was taking the actions that may
<br>
have destroyed documents.  Or perhaps the management is being
<br>
two-faced.  In either case the people involved should be held
<br>
criminally responsible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They encouraged people to invest into a situation that didn't really exist.
</em><br>
<p>It &quot;did exist&quot;, they were trying a very complex strategy to defer
<br>
taxes and it all came apart.  The first commercial company I worked
<br>
for in the late '70s was doing the same thing with a concept called
<br>
&quot;leveraged leasing&quot;.  That strategy all came apart when the tax laws
<br>
were changed in the '80s.  The Enron folks simply figured out a new
<br>
way to play the game and played it until people began to realize that
<br>
they just might be bluffing.
<br>
<p>The problem is with a system that allows people to &quot;bluff&quot;.  It isn't
<br>
much different from vaporware in the software industry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not a description of true capitalism or a free market as the article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims.  It is true that investments are risky, but fraud is not supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be one of those risks.
</em><br>
<p>Oh but it is unless you take government regulation and taxes out of
<br>
the picture.  Now as has been discussed on the list many times you
<br>
could remove the regulations and allow the liability laws to work
<br>
in their place.  But to really make that work you need affordable
<br>
lawyers.  That would allow the small business owners who are getting
<br>
stiffed by Enron [$4,000 (a floral shop) or $12,000 (a deli)] to
<br>
stand a chance of collecting.  To have a true capitalistic system
<br>
where companies and people really have to be responsible for their
<br>
actions, we need to increase the number of law schools and double
<br>
or triple the supply of lawyers to allow their use in these situations.
<br>
<p>I for one am not sure that I would really like to live in that society
<br>
though.  At least not until I have a sub-AI agent that is clever
<br>
enough to tell me the relative risks I bear of getting sued for
<br>
any action I take in my public or professional life.
