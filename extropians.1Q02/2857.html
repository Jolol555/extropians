<p>By BBC News Online's Ivan Noble
<br>
<p>Plans to extend free access to scientific and academic research papers
<br>
have received a boost with the announcement of a $3m grant from financier
<br>
and philanthropist George Soros' Open Society Institute.
<br>
<p>The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which
<br>
scholars give to the world without expectation of payment
<br>
<p>Budapest Open Access Initiative
<br>
Open access advocate Professor Stevan Harnad of the University of
<br>
Southampton, UK, says the money could make it easier for academics wanting
<br>
to set up their own alternatives to commercially run journals.
<br>
<p>&quot;The vast potential benefits of open access to research and researchers
<br>
are already there... but the subsidy lowers the entry barriers for
<br>
would-be open-access initiatives,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Critics of commercial journals say their subscription charges hamper
<br>
research at institutes and in countries where research budgets are tight.
<br>
<p>They say that researchers write and review papers for free, so the
<br>
journals should not charge to read them.
<br>
<p>&quot;They don't want to get paid, what they want is that other researchers
<br>
should read and use their work,&quot; Professor Harnad told BBC News Online.
<br>
<p>&quot;The fact that their literature is treated for trade is anathema,&quot; he
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Budapest declaration
<br>
<p>Some commercial journals have extended the amount of literature they make
<br>
available for free in response to a boycott campaign by scientists calling
<br>
themselves the Public Library of Science.
<br>
<p>But journal publishers defend their charges as necessary to finance their
<br>
operations.
<br>
<p>The new money for open alternatives comes as part of a new declaration
<br>
called the Budapest Open Access Initiative, signed by dozens of
<br>
institutions and hundreds of researchers.
<br>
<p>They say they are not opposed to commercial journals, but want to see an
<br>
alternative system of free access journals and self- archiving set up in
<br>
parallel.
<br>
<p>&quot;The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which
<br>
scholars give to the world without expectation of payment,&quot; reads the
<br>
declaration.
<br>
<p>It calls for &quot;free availability on the public internet, permitting any
<br>
users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the
<br>
full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data
<br>
to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose&quot;.
<br>
<p>Seed money
<br>
<p>Professor Harnad's colleagues Chris Gutteridge and Rob Tansley developed a
<br>
piece of software called Eprints, which, they hope, makes the process of
<br>
publishing easier and therefore cheaper.
<br>
<p>He says the Soros money could be used to &quot;seed&quot; schemes where academics
<br>
will pay a small fee to have their papers reviewed but users will pay
<br>
nothing to read them.
<br>
<p>&quot;To start up and fill an institutional Eprint Archive costs less than
<br>
$10,000; to start up and fill an alternative journal costs less than
<br>
$50,000; so $3m can do a lot of good in three years,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>More important though than the money, he adds, is for there to be a
<br>
critical mass of research available from free archives online.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a question of when the dominos start falling,&quot; he said.
