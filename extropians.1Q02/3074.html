<em>&gt;From scerir:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&lt;This Venetian Macrocosm brought to you by your servant,
</em><br>
Amara&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;You forgot to mention this little venetian story, just one among
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a thousands.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Johannes Kepler published his 'Harmonices Mundi' in 1619 (Linz).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In this book he describes, for the very first time, his famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'stellarum duodecim planarum pentagonicarum', that is to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the stellated dodecahedron. Unfortunately (for Kepler) [...]
</em><br>
<p>Shakespeare probably wouldn't have written 'The Merchant of Venice'
<br>
if Venice had been a boring place.
<br>
<p>another story:
<br>
Venetian Marco Polo's nickname was Marco Il Milione (of the million
<br>
lies) because the city-folk didn't believe his tales -- hence the name
<br>
of the two little couryards where the Polo family lived: &quot;Corte Prima
<br>
del Milion&quot; and &quot;Corte Seconda del Milion&quot;.
<br>
<p>or another story:
<br>
of Galileo hoping to improve his status at the University of Padua
<br>
by pointing out to the Senate of Venice the powerful military
<br>
advantages of the telescope to observe distant sails that would
<br>
otherwise not be seen. This was done before he spent much time
<br>
observing the sky. By spending time improving the telescope and then
<br>
showing the telescope publically from the Campanile in the Piazza
<br>
San Marco (which collapsed under its own weight in 1902, but that's
<br>
another story), he gained a lead on the competition, who were just
<br>
beginning to bring other spyglasses into Venice.
<br>
<p>Other tidbits about Venice, I find interesting:
<br>
<p>Venetian houses/palazzos were always entered from the water (a city
<br>
with no roads, and that's why the facades on the water front), and
<br>
built usually with three storeys, serving as a warehouse and
<br>
business (lower floors), as well as a family home (upper floors).
<br>
<p>Venice was very difficult to attack and penetrate due to its
<br>
location built on distributed island swamps. It survived and thrived
<br>
for 1000 years, becoming the strongest commercial and naval force in
<br>
the Mediterranean, so much so, that in the early 1500s, the most
<br>
powerful people of that time: the pope, the kings of France and
<br>
Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor felt compelled to join forces to
<br>
stop the Venetian empire's advances. Venice's advances were halted,
<br>
but the city still thrived for another 200 years before its decline.
<br>
<p>The Venetian's naval strength was built on a boat: the trireme (oars
<br>
grouped in three), its shipyards were cranking out one one warship
<br>
per day.
<br>
<p>During the Middle Ages it had a kind of constitution, an elected
<br>
leader, and council of ten and additional council of 2000, from
<br>
which other officials were selected. It was not really a democracy
<br>
but probably better than most other things going during the Middle
<br>
Ages, driven mostly by business. Venice was politically independent
<br>
for most of its history and not part of Italy until the mid 1800s.
<br>
<p>The state-run Casino Ridotto was open to *anyone wearing a mask* (!)
<br>
but in 1774 was closed down because too many Venetians went
<br>
bankrupt while gambling inside.
<br>
<p>The large industrial center Mestre was founded by Venetians who
<br>
foresaw a day when development land would run out in the Lagoon. It
<br>
is essentially an extension of the same entrepreneurial spirit that
<br>
characterized Venice in her high time, and which still typifies the
<br>
Veneto region, which is now the most productive region in Europe.
<br>
<p>=====
<br>
<p>... and this is totally off-topic, but I think that someone should
<br>
write a book about the traveling adventures of government-stolen
<br>
art. Those Four Horses of St. Mark are now safely tucked away inside
<br>
of San Marco's Basilica (the dummy horses are those displayed
<br>
outside!).. well the Venetians claimed that the horses were theirs
<br>
when Napolean stole them and then he gave them back, but the Venetians
<br>
stole them from Constantipole four hundred years earlier! And those
<br>
obelisks that Rome proudly displays now were stolen by Mussolini and
<br>
now Egypt wants them back. And there are those many Greek art pieces
<br>
that the British Museum proudly displays as their own, which Greece
<br>
claims were stolen and would really like to havve returned.
