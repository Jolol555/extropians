&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This newsbreaking letter from Bill Falloon(co-owner of the powerhouse 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nutritional supplement corporation, Life Extension Foundation), and forwarded by Rudi             Hoffman(the king of life insurance for cryonics!),  announces plans which will definitely                   change the face of cryonics as we know it!  : )  It was about time for a cryonics org 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to once again be on the east coast!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to see Saul Kent and Bill Falloon including other 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;major cryonics players into their planning sessions.  Of course, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize they need to keep their future customers informed!  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice in the letter frustration over Alcor not being &quot;up to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snuff&quot; when it comes to being able to upgrade itself for full 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vitrification implementation.  But, despite pleas to fund    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposals by Fred Chamberlain and others, the money just has not 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been forthcoming!  I guess Fred and Linda made the mistake 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of not *first&quot; creating a for-profit multi-million dollar    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;company, which only than would be followed by the forming of a cryonics 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organization.  It is amazing how far they got with what they had.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My best wishes to Saul Kent and Bill Falloon.  They will show us how it's done!!     
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Important Cryonics announcement from Bill Falloon
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, Fellow Cryoneters,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudi Hoffman in Daytona, with a very exciting forwarding from Bill Falloon as 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promised. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have copied this in it's entirety from Bill, so the formatting may be a bit 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weird in this posting.  Here is data.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryonics MeetingMeeting Date: Saturday, February 16, 2002 at 2:00 pmPlace: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Extension Building1100 West Commercial Blvd-Ft. Lauderdale(Just West of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I-95. Call 1-800-544-4440 if you need directions)You are invited to an 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important meeting that will include members from ALL
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cryonics organizations. The purpose of this meeting is to gather our 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collective resources in order to make advanced cryo-preservation technology 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available within the next several months.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Extension Foundation has just purchased from Mike Darwin, equipment 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worth about $850,000.00 (including two ambulances). We are now looking at 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potential facilities in South Florida to move some of this equipment in to. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Darwin has offered to spend significant time in South Florida setting up 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new facility and training paramedics and other medical personnel to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implement the vitrification process developed at our 21st Century Medicine 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lab.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the dilemma we now face. Since 1991, Life Extension Foundation has 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spent approximately five million dollars to develop technologies that would 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enable us to perfect the cryo-preservation process. While we have made great 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strides in the laboratory, no cryonics organization has the capability to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fully implement the vitrification process we have developed.For those who 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't know, vitrification enables cells to be preserved with very little 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damage. Electron microscopy slides show minimal damage to vitrified cells 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compared to frozen cells.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcor has been provided with our vitrification technology, but they are not 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to deliver this technology to the cryonics patient in an optimal manner. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Alcor reaches the needed level of technical competence, those 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residing in Florida may be too far away from Alcor-Arizona to fully benefit 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, a training and vitrification facility should be established in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida so that those who deanimate here will have a reasonable opportunity 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be properly vitrified. It is imperative that we upgrade our ability to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliver emergency care so that cryonics patients can be properly prepared for 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vitrification procedures, whether they are performed in Florida or elsewhere.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Extension Foundation has already identified and retained paramedics 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;willing to be trained for these procedures. A preliminary agreement has been 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reached with Mike Darwin. Dave Shumaker, a long-time cryonicist as well as 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retired businessman has agreed to be the CEO of the company that will provide 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these services.This meeting has been scheduled because a growing number of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida cryonicists are aware that the quality of the cryo-preservation 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure can be greatly enhanced if coordinated efforts are made to harness 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the talents and resources of the many cryonicists residing in this State. We 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now need to identify cryonicists who would be willing to volunteer their time 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to assist Mike Darwin in setting up this facility and participate in training 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the paramedics. We also need cryonicists willing to make donations or 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investments to help fund the facility's operating expenses. The Life 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension Foundation has already committed substantial dollars towards this 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project.Mike Darwin is expected to participate at this meeting and there 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be new cryonicists present. Saul Kent will update us on ongoing 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research at the California research facilities we own. Jerry Lemler, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of Alcor will be on hand, along with Alcor Director Michael Riskin. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Yount, CEO of the American Cryonics Society (ACS) and Edgar Swank, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of ACS will also attend. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that cryonicists attend this extremely important meeting. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past twenty years, a number of attempts have been made to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-arrange emergency suspension services for Florida members, but the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reality is that we are woefully unprepared to handle a state-of-the-art 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cryo-preservation at this time.Now that we have access to medical 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professionals and advanced vitrification technology, it is time that we set 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the mechanism to deliver this service. Our objective is to set new 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standards in the clinical implementation of cryo-preservation. This may 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motivate other cryonics organizations (including Alcor) to contract with us 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deliver this enhanced service worldwide. If this were to be the case, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;providing the most advanced delivery of human vitrification services could 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn into a profit-making business. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important reason for this meeting, however, is to lay the groundwork 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure that we as individuals have the best opportunity to be vitrified 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under optimal conditions. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be mailing directions to the Life Extension building where the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting will be held. Call Dayna Dye at 954-766-8433 if you have any 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions.The meeting should last between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm. To make sure 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have allocated enough space in the Life Extension building to house this 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting, please notify Dayna Dye if you are going to attend. Call her at
