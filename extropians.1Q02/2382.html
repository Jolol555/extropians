</em><br>
<p>Yes I agree the jury is still out.  I do not consider the global warming
<br>
theory a conspiracy, but I see it as a theory with a political agenda.  The
<br>
evidence suggesting global cooling has no such political power behind
<br>
it.  Actual evidence of cooling seldom makes a ripple, even though the
<br>
consequences of global cooling would be far more difficult for humanity
<br>
to deal with, since it would likely happen far more quickly.
<br>
<p>Consider the notions from our mass media, such as the AI movie
<br>
showing the New York skyline protruding above the waves.  Such
<br>
images have great power over the imagination of the proletariat, even
<br>
though the actual science suggests any such transition would take
<br>
tens of thousands of years, if it were to happen at all.
<br>
<p>With global cooling, however, it is easy to imagine a positive
<br>
feedback loop that could easily close:  a far greater snowfall than
<br>
average fails to melt on year, greatly increasing the earth's albedo.
<br>
I could imagine such a mini-ice age transition occurring over a
<br>
period of a century or perhaps less.
<br>
<p>Finally, this planet is not goldilocks-just-right, it isnt perfect for
<br>
the lifeforms that evolved here, it is somewhat colder than ideal.
<br>
Much perfectly good land is covered with ice, whereas there is
<br>
very little land on this planet that is too hot for life.  The equator
<br>
teems with life, the poles are nearly barren.  spike
