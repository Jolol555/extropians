&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This newsbreaking letter from Bill Falloon(co-owner of the powerhouse
<br>
nutritional supplement       corporation, Life Extension Foundation)
<br>
announces plans which will definitely change the face        of cryonics as
<br>
we know it!  : )  It was about time for a cryonics org to once again be on
<br>
the          east coast!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to see Saul Kent and Bill Falloon including other major
<br>
cryonics players into    their planning sessions.  Of course, I realize they
<br>
need to keep their future customers    informed!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice in the letter frustration over Alcor not being &quot;up to snuff&quot;
<br>
when it comes to being    able to upgrade itself for full vitrification
<br>
implementation.  But, despite    pleas to fund    proposals by Fred
<br>
Chamberlain and others, the money just has not been    forthcoming!  I
<br>
guess Fred and Linda made the mistake of not *first&quot; creating a for-profit
<br>
multi-million dollar    company, which only than would be followed by the
<br>
forming of a cryonics    organization.  It is    amazing how far they got
<br>
with what they had.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My best wishes to Saul Kent and Bill Falloon.  They will show us how it's
<br>
done!!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Important Cryonics announcement from Bill Falloon
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, Fellow Cryoneters,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudi Hoffman in Daytona, with a very exciting forwarding from Bill
<br>
Falloon as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promised.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have copied this in it's entirety from Bill, so the formatting may be a
<br>
bit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weird in this posting.  Here is data.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryonics MeetingMeeting Date: Saturday, February 16, 2002 at 2:00
<br>
pmPlace:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Extension Building1100 West Commercial Blvd-Ft. Lauderdale(Just West
<br>
of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I-95. Call 1-800-544-4440 if you need directions)You are invited to an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important meeting that will include members from ALL
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cryonics organizations. The purpose of this meeting is to gather our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collective resources in order to make advanced cryo-preservation
<br>
technology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available within the next several months.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Extension Foundation has just purchased from Mike Darwin, equipment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worth about $850,000.00 (including two ambulances). We are now looking at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potential facilities in South Florida to move some of this equipment in
<br>
to.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Darwin has offered to spend significant time in South Florida
<br>
setting up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new facility and training paramedics and other medical personnel to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implement the vitrification process developed at our 21st Century
<br>
Medicine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lab.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the dilemma we now face. Since 1991, Life Extension Foundation
<br>
has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spent approximately five million dollars to develop technologies that
<br>
would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enable us to perfect the cryo-preservation process. While we have made
<br>
great
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strides in the laboratory, no cryonics organization has the capability to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fully implement the vitrification process we have developed.For those who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't know, vitrification enables cells to be preserved with very little
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damage. Electron microscopy slides show minimal damage to vitrified cells
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compared to frozen cells.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcor has been provided with our vitrification technology, but they are
<br>
not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to deliver this technology to the cryonics patient in an optimal
<br>
manner.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Alcor reaches the needed level of technical competence, those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residing in Florida may be too far away from Alcor-Arizona to fully
<br>
benefit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, a training and vitrification facility should be established in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida so that those who deanimate here will have a reasonable
<br>
opportunity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be properly vitrified. It is imperative that we upgrade our ability to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliver emergency care so that cryonics patients can be properly prepared
<br>
for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vitrification procedures, whether they are performed in Florida or
<br>
elsewhere.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Extension Foundation has already identified and retained paramedics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;willing to be trained for these procedures. A preliminary agreement has
<br>
been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reached with Mike Darwin. Dave Shumaker, a long-time cryonicist as well
<br>
as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retired businessman has agreed to be the CEO of the company that will
<br>
provide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these services.This meeting has been scheduled because a growing number
<br>
of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida cryonicists are aware that the quality of the cryo-preservation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure can be greatly enhanced if coordinated efforts are made to
<br>
harness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the talents and resources of the many cryonicists residing in this State.
<br>
We
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now need to identify cryonicists who would be willing to volunteer their
<br>
time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to assist Mike Darwin in setting up this facility and participate in
<br>
training
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the paramedics. We also need cryonicists willing to make donations
<br>
or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investments to help fund the facility's operating expenses. The Life
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension Foundation has already committed substantial dollars towards
<br>
this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project.Mike Darwin is expected to participate at this meeting and there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be new cryonicists present. Saul Kent will update us on ongoing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research at the California research facilities we own. Jerry Lemler,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of Alcor will be on hand, along with Alcor Director Michael
<br>
Riskin.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Yount, CEO of the American Cryonics Society (ACS) and Edgar Swank,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of ACS will also attend.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that cryonicists attend this extremely important
<br>
meeting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past twenty years, a number of attempts have been made to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-arrange emergency suspension services for Florida members, but the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reality is that we are woefully unprepared to handle a state-of-the-art
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cryo-preservation at this time.Now that we have access to medical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professionals and advanced vitrification technology, it is time that we
<br>
set
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the mechanism to deliver this service. Our objective is to set new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standards in the clinical implementation of cryo-preservation. This may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motivate other cryonics organizations (including Alcor) to contract with
<br>
us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deliver this enhanced service worldwide. If this were to be the case,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;providing the most advanced delivery of human vitrification services
<br>
could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn into a profit-making business.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important reason for this meeting, however, is to lay the
<br>
groundwork
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure that we as individuals have the best opportunity to be
<br>
vitrified
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under optimal conditions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be mailing directions to the Life Extension building where the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting will be held. Call Dayna Dye at 954-766-8433 if you have any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions.The meeting should last between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm. To make
<br>
sure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have allocated enough space in the Life Extension building to house
<br>
this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting, please notify Dayna Dye if you are going to attend. Call her at
<br>

<br>
to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the conversation, a buffet dinner will be held at Saul Kent   s
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residence located at the L-Hermitage condominium on Ft. Lauderdale Beach
