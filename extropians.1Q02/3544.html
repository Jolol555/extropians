Subject: Re: SOFTWARE: Do you play computer games?
<br>
<p>My main complaint is that all these new technologies doesn't really
<br>
change the world - you still have cities, army units and mines even
<br>
when your devices are nanotech with AI powered by controlled
<br>
singularities. I would really like to create a game where such
<br>
developments really changed the way everything worked, but I realize
<br>
this might be extremely tricky to do game balance-wise and in a way that
<br>
non-initiated players would understand. 
<br>
<p>One day - when I have time - I would dearly love to participate in
<br>
writing a game like SMAC with truly transhuman technologies and more
<br>
interesting personality simulations of the opponents. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Indeed, same here.  I can not add another 'extropian' like game that exists
<br>
to the list (I did really like alpha centauri) but, like Anders, I would
<br>
like to write my own sometime.  My idea, in case there are any programmers
<br>
out there with a lot of free time would be an RTS, like star craft / alpha
<br>
centauri.  It starts in a similiar way that some other games out there
<br>
start, at the beginning of technological evolution, say early in the
<br>
agricultural age.  The whole game is logorithmically based, at first you
<br>
control individual units (your village people) the game progresses through
<br>
the ages and technological changes.  Not a whole lot different then what
<br>
some other games do.  But here is the difference, the game progresses far
<br>
into the future from Type I to Type II onto Type III galactic civilizations.
<br>
Your map starts out as, say, a 1km x 1km grid, a town or village.  You
<br>
control individual units, they are all to scale and 3D models.  But, as
<br>
technology and scale progresses, your map gets bigger and you can scale in
<br>
and out.  The smallest map is 1km x 1km, and covers 1km^2, the next can be
<br>
10km x 10km, a county sized scale (or maybe something in between, 2.5km,
<br>
5km)  At 10km you control 10 units at a time, and AI takes a small hold over
<br>
the units.  You zoom out again, you are at 100km x 100km and control 100
<br>
units at a time (for example)  Your territory covers a whole state.  You
<br>
scale further out to provinces, countries, hemispheres, planets, solar
<br>
systems, galaxies, galactic clusters...  
<br>
<p>The flow of time would not be linear as well, as you progress further, time
<br>
passes more rapidly (just as kurzweil speaks of the diminishing time between
<br>
salient events) At the basic level, time passes 1 sec for every second
<br>
played, then moves to a 10:1, 100:1, etc. etc.  
<br>
<p>The technological progression can probably be modeled by following basic
<br>
technological curves, things that like speed of transportation, (past the
<br>
confining light speed limit of classical / relativistic physics through
<br>
whatever technological name you muster) 
<br>
<p>The main measurement in the game will be energy, how much energy is your
<br>
society producing how much can it control / harness (for transporation,
<br>
weapons, etc)
<br>
<p>Energy generation / storage devices will go through the same technological
<br>
curves.
<br>
<p>I would like it to be 3D, so views could be scaled and rotated easily, and
<br>
to switch to a first person view as well (which just amounts to a different
<br>
camera location in the 3D world)  
<br>
<p>The game could start out as just one planet, and expansion packs would make
<br>
solar systems, galactic quadrants, galaxies, etc. available.
<br>
<p>I would like to model algorithms that make up the names for the
<br>
technological breakthroughs, so they will not be limited or predifined, and
<br>
different civiliazations may have different means of accomplishing these
<br>
things (different size devices, different levels of effeciency, etc)
<br>
<p>Ok, Im done.... back to the real world.
<br>
<p>=)
<br>
