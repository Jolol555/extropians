</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You know, many called what I presented &quot;ludicrous&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; or
<br>
&quot;wildly irrational&quot; ... yet nobody's been able to really give
<br>
reasons why other than lots of poo-pooing.
<br>
<p>I say that while unattractive and however improbable my conspiracy theory
<br>
is, it coincides with the recorded history and track record of the
<br>
United States government.
<br>
<p>Back in World War I, we let a passenger ship (the Lusitania) get
<br>
sunk.  It was carrying munitions, and people were unaware of it:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch05.htm">http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch05.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Lusitania was a luxury liner that had been built in part with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;government money and obliged to serve the country in time of war. In
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;addition to passengers, the Lusitania was carrying munitions. When it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arrived in British waters a German submarine sank it, and 1,198 people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;died, including 128 Americans. In Britain and the United States,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people were outraged. American newspapers stated as fact that no war
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;material had been aboard the Lusitania. The secondary explosion of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;munitions on board was erroneously described as a second torpedo.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspaper editors described submarine warfare as cruel and barbaric --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;too barbaric ever to be employed by Americans.&quot;
<br>
<p>Wow, the media tried to cover it up even back then.  Surprised?
<br>
<p>We sent countless people to Indochina to be slaughtered.  We
<br>
called it &quot;the Vietnam war&quot;, right?  I'd like to read this
<br>
book sometime:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guerrillanews.com/war_conspiracy/war_intro.html">http://www.guerrillanews.com/war_conspiracy/war_intro.html</a>
<br>
<p>Who here has heard of Watergate?  We're not even sure what it really
<br>
was all about, but it was of high enough significance to cause
<br>
Nixon to resign.  That's gotta be one big skeleton in that closet.
<br>
<p>What about the &quot;war on drugs&quot;?  I'm surprised nobody has called our
<br>
occupation in Afghanistan part of the &quot;war on drugs&quot;:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.drugtext.org/articles/ial5.html">http://www.drugtext.org/articles/ial5.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect was the same as the CIA shifted its attention to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theterrorist war against Nicaragua and the Afghan resistance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;againstSoviet occupation. The complicity of the Reagan-Bush
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;administrationsin the drug rackets in Central America as a part of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their Contrasupport operations is by now well known. Pakistan is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reportedto have become one of the major international centers of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;herointrade when Afghan manufacturers and dealers &quot;found
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theiroperations restricted after the Soviet invasion in 1979&quot;,and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;moved the enterprise across the borders (South). &quot;TheU.S. government
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has for several years received, but declined toinvestigate, reports of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;heroin trafficking by some Afghan guerillasand Pakistani military
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;officers with whom it cooperates&quot;,the Washington Post reported well
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;after the drug war was chargingfull steam ahead. United States
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;officials have received first-handaccounts of &quot;extensive heroin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;smuggling&quot; by leadingAfghan recipients of US aid and the Pakistani
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;military establishment,who gave detailed information to the press in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pakistan and Washington.&quot;Nevertheless, according to U.S. officials,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the United Stateshas failed to investigate or take action against some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(read &quot;any&quot;)of those suspected&quot;. US favorite Gulbudin Hekmatyar,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theterrorist leader of the fundamentalist Hizbe-Islami Party,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;isreported to be deeply implicated in drug trafficking. Other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reportsindicate that the Afghat rebels are being &quot;debilitated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;byincreasingly fierce local battles for the lucrative heroin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;trade&quot;(9).
<br>
<p>Perhaps we're bitter because the heroin money from Afghanistan
<br>
ran out, after what we gave them in aid against the Soviets,
<br>
so we're sending in our muscle to &quot;collect what's owed to us&quot;?
<br>
<p>We sell armaments and train militia in other countries just so we
<br>
can go there and expend our military budget.  Sound unreasonable?
<br>
Our government does it.
<br>
<p>1915.  1969-1970.  1968-1974.  1979.  It goes on ...
<br>
<p>While we all strive for physical and intellectual evolution, what
<br>
makes you think that politicans have changed much in the past 200
<br>
years?
