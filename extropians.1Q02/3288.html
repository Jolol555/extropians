<em>&gt; Perfectionism&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.markalanwalker.com/abso.htm">http://www.markalanwalker.com/abso.htm</a> . Perfectionism is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualistic than say a utilitarian form of conquentialism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursuit of perfection is something that the individual must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than passively receive. There is no end to what we 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; others in on the classic utilitarian model, for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectionist we can at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best provide individuals the preconditions for the pursuit of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfection. However, I don't know how extropianism sits with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectionism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g., perfectionism still has scope for other regarding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtues rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the virtue of selfishness, I don't know how this sits with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropianism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps such virtues are considered gratuitous since we can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always count on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the invisible hand to catch those who stumble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>To me, the pursuit of perfection would imply a process with a beginning &amp; an
<br>
end for each individual. Extropianism seems to imply a process of unbounded
<br>
improvement, ie: a beginning but no end. This would seem to be a significant
<br>
incompatibility.
<br>
<p>Further, your Absolute Perfectionism seems to imply an absolute standard of
<br>
perfection. This is completely contrary to the &quot;self transformation&quot; ethic
<br>
in transhumanism, which would encourage diversity, not sameness.
<br>
<p>Really, I find the perfectionist ideal to be overly negative. We would be
<br>
defined in terms of what we have failed to attain, rather than who we are.
