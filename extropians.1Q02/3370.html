<em>&gt; &gt; I have been wondering why so many of the world's most powerful religions

<em>&gt; &gt; seem to have been born around the same time. It seems to me that many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the big religions got much of their power from the birth of writing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No; writing was invented long before - around 4100-3800 BCE. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sumerians, egyptians and babylonians were writing thousands of years
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You are right -- I shouldn't have said &quot;birth&quot; of writing. I know writing 
<br>
has been around longer than the world's big current religions. The others 
<br>
had their religions too... they just died out when their civilisations 
<br>
folded. It just seems to me that early writing was dreadfully important -- 
<br>
the awe they had for the written word -- The Book -- when the technology 
<br>
was ooh aah new. It may be the shift from oral to written recording that 
<br>
may be crucial -- when writing is new for each people.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The first big monotheist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion was Zoroastrism, which emerged around ~1400 BCE. Judaism maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emerged from around 2000 BCE onwards, hinduism evolved around 1500 BCE,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buddhism around 600 BCE. Christianity emerged around 100 CE, and islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around 600 CE. Overall, the emergence of new religions appear rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evenly spaced. However, the ideas that are incorporated may have emerged
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elsewhere and in far older times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would really like to know what happend 500-400 BCE - look at the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of extremely influential philosophers suddenly popping up worldwide; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important greek ones in the West, Sun Tzu, Confucius, Buddha etc. Why so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many at this time?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, this is what I mean. I was thinking it may be connected with this 
<br>
reverence for written works. Of course I could be totally on the wrong 
<br>
track... something about it feels right though...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; There would have been a special awe for written works back then when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology was still new.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;True. This is especially noticeable in the &quot;people of the book&quot;, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judeo-christian-islamic sphere. Here greek ideas about the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality as words/text/information get linked with religion in a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strong sense. No wonder cabala and &quot;magic&quot; using sacred books (swearing on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bibles, placing sacred scriptures as protections) became popular.
</em><br>
