[Amara Grasp]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What you present here, between Einstein and Bohr, looks to me as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another example of a Bayesian versus a non-Bayesian point of view in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science. In particular, the difference between our knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, and reality itself.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. But the question here is: 'knowledge of what?'.
<br>
<p>A theory need make no direct reference to reality, in order
<br>
to be successful and accurate, in its predictions. Probability
<br>
theory may predict the (probable) outcome of a roulette wheel,
<br>
knowing nothing about about the dynamics of the roulette,
<br>
perhaps even assuming nothing about the determinism or the 
<br>
indeterminism of physical laws. But here, in the quantum
<br>
world, we even do not see roulettes, horse races, gambling
<br>
houses.
<br>
<p>In example, the two-slit experiment. Interference suggests
<br>
that _physical_ waves are interfering. But wavefunctions are
<br>
not _physical_ waves, they are mathematical tools for evaluating
<br>
probabilities. And if we identify wavefunctions with physical waves
<br>
we are in trouble, many paradoxes arise. (btw, If we deny that the 
<br>
change of the wf. that occurs during the measurement process is 
<br>
a _physical_ process, then _what_ leads to the destruction of the 
<br>
possibility of interference?)
<br>
<p>Another one. The wavefunction of the four (outer) electron of a
<br>
carbon atom (in the ground state) produces a tetrahedral structure,
<br>
in the ordinary space, which yields to the structure of the diamond
<br>
crystal. But the wf. of those four electrons lives in a 12-d. space.
<br>
<p>Another one. The Schroedinger's cat. Can this cat, a macroscopic
<br>
object, live in a superposition of states (unreal too)? Friedman et al 
<br>
presented (Nature 406, 43 - 46, 2000) the experimental evidence that 
<br>
a superconducting quantum interference macroscopic device (SQUID) 
<br>
can be put into a superposition of two magnetic-flux states: one 
<br>
corresponding to a few microamperes of current flowing clockwise, 
<br>
the other corresponding to the same amount of current flowing anticlockwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But that is not the end of my story. It's interesting to note
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that Heisenberg (but not Bohr) believed that the 'collapse' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the 'wave packet' (thus also those 'spooky' actions) was _indeed_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a physical action, triggered by the 'indivisibility' of the particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory, Un. Chicago P.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;page 39). Was he right ? It seems so.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Here Heisenberg is mixing up realities of Nature, with incomplete human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about Nature.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, again. But, again: 'information about what?'.
