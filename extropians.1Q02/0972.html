From: &quot;Lee Daniel Crocker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20One%20humanity,%20all%20in%20the%20same%20boat">lee@piclab.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; You seem to be laboring under a pathologically narrow definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;job&quot;, which is a much more flexible concept than you give it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credit for.  Step back and take the larger view: resources as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole, i.e., food, water, housing, etc., cannot help but increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as technology increases.  The rate of population growth decreases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with technology.  So the total available resources per person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always be increasing (with a few short-term fluctuations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here and there caused by transaction costs and such).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who need those things must (1) become producers, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes easier as technology advances, (2) bargain with producers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their goods, which likewise becomes easier because increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply and decreasing demand drives prices down, (3) become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predators, stealing from the productive (such as becoming a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government).  Setting aside (3) for the moment, bargaining for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods produced by others can only become easier as technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances, to the point where a &quot;job&quot; consisting of nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking goods off producer's hands might be enough to bargain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them.  A person might have to do nothing more than fill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a marketing survey for some company once a month to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough money to live comfortably for the month (of course, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who are fabulously wealthy by today's standards will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lament their abject poverty just as the so-called poor today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with running water and good food and safe housing and televisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cars do today).  A &quot;job&quot; is merely doing anything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits some other person in some way, and may be as minimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as providing an entertaining story (like the San Franisco
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homeless man who tells jokes for $1), or as complex as building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction; the level of labor each person performs will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever gives him an adequate standard of living by his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, most people will have skillsand talents that allow them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large enough share of the produced goods that they can afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give some away as well.  Some will do so for pure ego: to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control a family or a congregation, for example. Some will do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so as rationally self-interested charity, to reduce the amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of predation in their neighborhood.  At any rate, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely and increasingly unlikely that anyone will actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starve without there being /something/ he can offer for food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and shelter, even if it's nothing but a promise to stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downwind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You seem to be making an empirical claim that starvation is not likely. If
<br>
the null hypothesis is that some people do in fact starve how many deaths
<br>
should constitute refutation of your claim? Perhaps I am soft, or soft in
<br>
the head, but I would prefer to see a de jure solution rather than a de
<br>
facto bet that starvation will not occur. (At minimum, this is consistent
<br>
with the trickle down model with some safeguard built in in case the trickle
<br>
down dries up).
