Just in time to adapt for monitoring the Indian subcontinent watershed contamination effects when the

India-Pakistan conflict goes nuclear! Yay!

<p><p><p>Swarms Of Tiny Robots To Monitor Water Pollution
<br>
<p>The University of Southern California School of Engineering has 
<br>
received a $1.5 million research grant from the National Science 
<br>
Foundation to create swarms of microscopic robots to monitor 
<br>
potentially dangerous microorganisms in the ocean.
<br>
<p>&quot;With increasing urban runoff, sewage spills and blooms of harmful 
<br>
algae off heavily populated coastal areas, it is very important to be 
<br>
able to sense, and then identify, particular ocean microorganisms 
<br>
quickly,&quot; said Ari Requicha, a USC professor of computer science and 
<br>
the project's principal investigator. &quot;The quicker we learn that a 
<br>
pathogen is present in the water, the sooner we can warn people and 
<br>
begin action to correct the situation.&quot;
<br>
<p>The project spans the fields of nanotechnology, robotics, computer 
<br>
science and marine biology, but is centered on the development of the 
<br>
ultra-small robotic sensors and software systems to control them.
<br>
<p>Requicha directs the USC School of Engineering's Laboratory for 
<br>
Molecular Robotics where his team has been experimenting with 
<br>
nanometer-scale structures for nearly seven years.
<br>
<p>(One nanometer is one/one-billionth of a meter. A nanometer is to a 
<br>
meter what a small grape is to the entire Earth.)
<br>
<p>In the 1980s, scientists discovered that the sharp silicon tip of the 
<br>
newly invented scanning probe microscope not only produced images 
<br>
revealing individual atoms and molecules, but it sometimes moved them.
<br>
<p>The computer-controlled microscope scans microscopic samples, sensing 
<br>
their minute atomic forces and precisely mapping the surface at a 
<br>
molecular or even atomic level.
<br>
<p>Working with colloidal gold and silver balls as small as two 
<br>
nanometers, and string-like organic molecules called dithiols that 
<br>
tether the balls to each other, Requicha's group has programmed their 
<br>
atomic force microscope -- a particular kind of scanning 
<br>
probe-microscope -- to slide the &quot;nanoscale&quot; particles into precise 
<br>
positions on tiny slabs of mica or silicon.
<br>
<p>They can chemically link the particles to form crude assemblies, and 
<br>
they can make &quot;nanowires&quot; by depositing metals on strings of 
<br>
carefully positioned balls.
<br>
<p>&quot;We do this at room temperature and at normal air pressure, and we 
<br>
can also work in water and other liquids, which is crucial for 
<br>
biological applications,&quot; said Requicha.
<br>
<p>The group has made a nanoscale single-electron transistor and an 
<br>
optical waveguide, which is a structure used to guide light. They are 
<br>
working on an actuator, or switch, and are starting to fabricate more 
<br>
complex 3D &quot;nanostructures&quot; by building up successive layers of 
<br>
nanoscale assemblies. Each layer is surrounded by a &quot;sacrificial&quot; 
<br>
material that holds it in place and that is removed when all the 
<br>
layers are complete to leave a tiny nanoelectromechanical device.
<br>
<p>Substances being investigated for use as the sacrificial material 
<br>
include charged polymers, zinc phosphonate films and organic 
<br>
compounds containing silicon known as silanes.
<br>
<p>Requicha said it will be possible to build nanoscale devices with 
<br>
electrical and mechanical components so that the devices could propel 
<br>
themselves, send electronic signals and even compute. While 
<br>
individual nanoscale devices would have far less computing power and 
<br>
capability than full-sized devices, the plan is to have vast numbers 
<br>
of them operating in concert.
<br>
<p>It often takes Requicha's team weeks to assemble even a simple 
<br>
nanoscale object, but the procedure can be automated once the 
<br>
computer programming is perfected. Other labs are working on atomic 
<br>
force microscopes with more than one tip. Requicha said a single 
<br>
atomic force microscope could theoretically have an array containing 
<br>
thousands or even millions of tips, all controlled by the same 
<br>
computer program to manufacture large numbers of nanoscale devices.
<br>
<p>David Caron, professor of biological sciences and a co-investigator 
<br>
on the project, said ocean robots needn't be terribly complicated or 
<br>
powerful to be useful. A single robot might sense only whether the 
<br>
water is fresh or saline and communicate by a faint radio signal only 
<br>
with other robots closest to it, which would then relay the 
<br>
information to other robots in the network linked to the Internet by 
<br>
still more robots.
<br>
<p>In the next year, Caron hopes to attach an antibody to a microscope 
<br>
tip. He recently created an antibody that binds to Aureococcus 
<br>
anophagefferens, the toxic algae known as Brown Tide. With the same 
<br>
procedure widely used to test for HIV and other diseases, he can 
<br>
reliably test for the algae.
<br>
<p>&quot;That test takes a day in the lab, which is an improvement over 
<br>
current testing, but it's still not fast enough,&quot; said Caron. The 
<br>
microscope should detect the algae the instant a microorganism binds 
<br>
to the antibody on its tip.
<br>
<p>Requicha estimates that it will be a decade before the researchers 
<br>
can build and deploy nanoscale robots in the ocean capable of the 
<br>
kind of instant and specific test like Caron's for Brown Tide. Along 
<br>
the way, he hopes the project will spin off technology in marine 
<br>
biology and other areas.
<br>
<p>&quot;Suppose we put 15-nanometer particles on a grid with 100-nanometer 
<br>
spacing, which we can routinely do in our lab today. If we interpret 
<br>
the presence of a particle as a binary one and its absence as a zero, 
<br>
we have a scheme to store data,&quot; he said. &quot;The bit density is 10 
<br>
gigabytes per square centimeter, which means we have data storage 
<br>
that is 100 times better than today's compact disks. And it could be 
<br>
even greater with smaller particles and spacing.&quot;
<br>
<p>The USC researchers will first build small robots that will move, 
<br>
sense and communicate while tethered in a tank of water in a 
<br>
laboratory. They will gradually progress to building and controlling 
<br>
increasingly larger numbers of increasingly smaller freely moving 
<br>
robots. The end goal of the project will be to create robots that are 
<br>
as small as the microorganisms that they seek to monitor.
<br>
<p>&quot;Today, we commonly do experiments with five or ten robots,&quot; said 
<br>
Gaurav Sukhatme, USC assistant professor of computer science and a 
<br>
co-investigator on the project. &quot;But we'll need algorithms to 
<br>
coordinate a million or more robots. That is a daunting problem, and 
<br>
we must start laying out the foundations for large numbers of robots 
<br>
long before they are a reality.&quot;
<br>
<p>Requicha said that nanotechnology today is at the same stage of 
<br>
development as the Internet was in the late 1960's.
<br>
<p>&quot;The idea that we'll have swarms of nanorobots in the ocean is no 
<br>
more far-fetched than the idea of connecting millions of computers 
<br>
was then,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think these robots will be confined to 
<br>
the ocean. We will eventually make robots to hunt down pathogens or 
<br>
repair cells in the human body.&quot;
<br>
<p>The grant is from the National Science Foundation's Information 
<br>
Technology Research program. Maja Mataric, associate professor of 
<br>
computer science and director of the USC School of Engineering's 
<br>
Robotics Research Laboratories, and Deborah Estrin, a computer 
<br>
networking specialist from UCLA, are also co-investigators on the 
<br>
project. - By Bob Calverly
