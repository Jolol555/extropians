<em>&gt; &gt;PBS tonight (here in LA, see local listings) is showing an Oscar nominated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;documentary, Sound and Fury, about the controversy in the deaf community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;over cochlear implants for deaf children, which can restore hearing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;See <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/soundandfury/">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/soundandfury/</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It seems almost unbelievable that what is in many ways a cure for deafness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;could be controversial.  One would think that parents would want the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;best for their children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This &quot;debate&quot; has been going on for a couple years now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a perfect example of what is happening to this society. The problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may well be that this society is too large and complex, hence our watchdogs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other &quot;bullshit&quot; mechanisms have been crippled by various forces and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests.
</em><br>
<p>The claim that deaf culture is something which should be preserved by
<br>
the repression of cochlear implant technology is about as logical a
<br>
claim as a claim that POW culture should be preserved by leaving POWs in
<br>
POW camps long after wars have been won.
<br>
<p>On a similar note, you'll notice that few Japanese Americans are very
<br>
put out at having their &quot;Internment Camp Culture&quot; violated by their
<br>
release after WWII....
<br>
<p>This illustrates that cultures, in and of themselves, have no rights,
<br>
they are figments of individual humans imaginations in order to survive
<br>
in the circumstances they are put in at the time. To seek to remain in
<br>
suboptimal cultures long after the circumstances that brought them about
<br>
are alleviated is simply a form of Stockholm Syndrome: introversion,
<br>
indentification with the oppressor, and denial of reality.
