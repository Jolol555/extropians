The fundamental mistake number 1 of this discussion is IMO to call for 
<br>
&quot;facts&quot;, like statistics, etc. These &quot;facts&quot; are the least important thing 
<br>
for your enemies, i.e. &quot;terrorist&quot; groups all over the world. They have a 
<br>
picture of the USA and the US people, and this picture is so strong that it 
<br>
obviously even survives years of living in the USA. So, those here calling 
<br>
for &quot;facts&quot; or drawing plans solely based on these &quot;facts&quot; only show that 
<br>
they haven't got the whole picture, yet.
<br>
<p>Facts that really matter are: Those people feel their country, their 
<br>
religion and their culture exploitet, devastetet and betrayed by the USA 
<br>
and you won't convince them with statistical data. The attitude &quot;we never 
<br>
did anything wrong&quot; won't help you, but instead add fuel to the anti-US 
<br>
groups. So much for the terrorists.
<br>
<p>You also won't convince the afghan people - remember the farmer with the 
<br>
sack of wheat - with US style infrastructure made by US companies without 
<br>
integration of the people there at all levels. You have to take these 
<br>
people and their view serious or you will achieve nothing at all. 
<br>
Fundamental mistake number 2 is to ignore the cultural background of other 
<br>
people. Peanut butter in food packets for example, with written 
<br>
instructions in several western languages. (1) Afghans don't know peanut 
<br>
butter, nor is it a usefull food for starving people. (2) 48% of the men 
<br>
and 78% of the women are illiterate. (3) There're a dozen or so different 
<br>
languages in that country.

<em>&gt; The USA has made significant efforts to only target members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Al Qa'ida and Taliban and I believe in most cases has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been successful in that effort.  I believe that most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would agree that although there have been some errors the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilian casualties have been minimal.
</em><br>
<p>Only few people actually question the necessity of the war against the 
<br>
Taliban and Al'Quaeda. What seems to be difficult to communicate is that a 
<br>
long chain of unwise behaviour of the US (and other countries) in the past 
<br>
has led to the hate and the hostility of many people against the western 
<br>
countries and especially the USA.
<br>
<p>We can't withdraw from the global political game at will. We are all 
<br>
confronted with the results of the mistakes of our fathers and former 
<br>
leaders in the past. The politics of the cold war has left many open 
<br>
accounts everywhere in the world: Vietnam, Cuba, Israel, Irak, Afghanistan, 
<br>
many countries in Africa and South America. We can either take the 
<br>
responsibility or ignore it and be the surprised victims of the 
<br>
counter-strikes. It is the ignorance that led to this no-alternative 
<br>
situation and if we don't actively try to solve the problems we have 
<br>
caused, the next crises are just behind the corner.
<br>
<p>Not even the USA will be able to really protect themselves against hundreds 
<br>
of groups like Al'Quaeda. We cannot simply shut the doors. We need global 
<br>
trade, resources, etc. Not even the USA will be able to bomb every country 
<br>
where people think they are the victims of US politics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;ethics&quot; of people with &quot;fundamentalist&quot; perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are drastically different from those of the America.  Grossly simplified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are &quot;If you believe what we believe, then we will tolerate you --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise we want to destroy you&quot; in contrast to something along the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines of &quot;We will try to understand you and accept you, even if your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs are quite different from our own&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Then, from my point of view, american foreign policy in the last hundred 
<br>
years was indeed &quot;fundamentalist&quot;. Good intentions often produce bad 
<br>
results because of poor wisdom.
