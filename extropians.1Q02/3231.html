Subject: PLEASE DON'T BAN CLONING posting to cryonet, PLUS a small rant
<br>
<p><p>Dear fellow cryoneters:
<br>
<p>Bill Falloon and Saul Kent are doing some great things for cryonics as you
<br>
read this.  They are, of course, the CEO's of Life Extension Foundation,
<br>
many of you may already be members. (At 75 bucks a year, includes TREMENDOUS
<br>
monthly magazine and discounts on food supplements/ anti-aging compounds,
<br>
and vitamins, a real bargain.)  Go to lef.org for their great website.
<br>
<p>Anyway, they have made it very easy to write your senator re: the current
<br>
cloning ban law currently in the Senate.
<br>
<p>I have reproduced the letter which I wrote to about 25 senators below.  It
<br>
is mostly from the LEF site.  Except the ending, where I get a little nasty
<br>
and emotional, designed as a stronger close than the professional and
<br>
&quot;understated&quot; sample letter from LEF.
<br>
<p>I may be professional.  But few who read this list regularly would accuse me
<br>
of being &quot;understated&quot;!  LOL!
<br>
<p>Friends, the long awaited WAR has begun!  I am referring to the oft
<br>
discussed tension between the forces of science, knowledge, technology, and
<br>
rationality Vs the forces of mythology, renouncement, &quot;God did not intend
<br>
for man to do this,&quot; and the attitude that &quot;I am not comfortable with the
<br>
possible ramifications of this, so I am going to lobby to criminalize your
<br>
even considering or researching possibilities.&quot;
<br>
<p>The religious right has massive funding, television stations, and the
<br>
tremendous blind faith of the religiously deluded. This is a society where
<br>
it is considered a positive if you believe something just BECAUSE there is
<br>
NO evidence of it!  This flawed but surprising effective epistemology has
<br>
engendered societies ruled by religious zealots throughout most of recorded
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>But back to the task at hand.  YOUR task.  If you value the possibility of
<br>
therapeutic cloning research improving YOUR life in the next 3 or 5 or 10
<br>
years.  Instead of the 15 or 20 or more which it could take if we allow the
<br>
U. S. government to CRIMINALIZE RESEARCH!
<br>
<p>Please write your senator about this.  Reprint the letter below, or reword
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Best and easiest, go to lef.org and utilize their already hypertexed email
<br>
addresses for senators.
<br>
<p>Here is letter.  The good parts are suggested or copied verbatim from LEF.
<br>
The ending diatribe is mine.
<br>
<p>Dear Senator,
<br>
<p>I urge you to vote AGAINST S. 790, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of
<br>
2001, sponsored by Kansas Republican Sam Brownback.  Passage of this bill
<br>
would make it a criminal offense to conduct research on the development of
<br>
new therapies using stem cells derived from very early-stage cloned embryos.
<br>
It would greatly slow the development of therapeutic cloning, the most
<br>
promising new technology in medicine.
<br>
<p>Therapeutic cloning involves the generation of young,
<br>
immunologically-identical cells, tissues, and organs for transplant.  It has
<br>
the potential to cure killers such as heart disease, stroke, cancer,
<br>
Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and Parkinson's disease.  It also
<br>
could be instrumental in the development of therapies to reverse the
<br>
infirmities and ravages of aging, leading to longer, healthier lives for
<br>
millions of Americans.
<br>
<p>Most of the top scientists in the United States SUPPORT THERAPEUTIC CLONING
<br>
RESEARCH.  These include Nobel laureates such as Dr. David Baltimore and Dr.
<br>
Harold Varmus and organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences.
<br>
(NAS), the National Institute of Health (NIH), and the Federation of
<br>
American Societies For Experimental Biology (FASEB.)
<br>
<p>It is IMPERATIVE that you and your colleges understand the ENORMOUS
<br>
potential of THERAPEUTIC cloning research.  Scientists who are conducting
<br>
this research, such as Dr. Michael West at Advanced Cell Technologies, are
<br>
HEROES.  This legislation could make these researchers into criminals.  This
<br>
is wrong.
<br>
<p>There is a distinction between Therapeutic cloning and Reproductive cloning.
<br>
Even if it IS necessary to place a temporary moratorium on human
<br>
REPRODUCTIVE cloning, please don't criminalize THERAPEUTIC cloning research.
<br>
<p>I would appreciate your response to this letter.
<br>
<p>Sincerely Yours,
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Rudi Hoffman
