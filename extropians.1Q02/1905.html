<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;It certainly contradicts Rands world-[view].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Nonsense]!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First read Rand.  She explains somewhere how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important reputation is in a free economy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how regulation undermines the function of reputation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             Lloyd
</em><br>
<p>A lucid analysis of this is found in the essay &quot;The Assualt on Integrity&quot;, by Alan Greenspan (orig. 1963), in
<br>
Rand, Ayn (editor), *Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal*, (orig. 1946- 1966), The New American Library, Inc., 1967
<br>
<p>&nbsp;excerpt-
<br>
==========
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What collectivists refuse to recognize is that it is in the self-interest of every businessman to have a reputation for honest
<br>
dealings and a quality product. Since the market value of a going business is measured by its money-making potential, reputation or
<br>
&quot;good will&quot; is as much an asset as its physical plant and equipment....&quot; [pp 118]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It requires years of consistently excellent performance to acquire a reputation and to establish it as a financial asset.
<br>
Thereafter, a still greater effort is required to maintain it: a company cannot afford to risk its years of investment by letting
<br>
down its standards of quality for one moment or one inferior product; nor would it be tempted by any &quot;quick killing&quot;....It is a
<br>
built-in safeguard of a free enterprise system nad the only real protection of consumers against business dishonesty....&quot; [pp119]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the consumer. It does not build quality into goods, or accuracy
<br>
into information. Its sole &quot;contribution is to substitute force and fear for incentive as the &quot;protector&quot; of the consumer. The
<br>
euphemisms of government press releases to the contrary not withstanding, the basis of regulation is armed force. At the bottom of
<br>
the endless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a gun...&quot;
<br>
=========
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reputation for integrity is also an individual's hard-earned asset, which takes years to acquire and can be lost overnight. It
<br>
is not something that can be purchased or fabricated from whole cloth. When that person is publicly slandered without basis, on an
<br>
email list for example, it may diminish his standing in the eyes of others, thus causing him harm. The legal remedy of suing for
<br>
libel is only partially effective, it cannot fully undo the tresspass. Other methods may be brought to bear, as in a barroom brawl.
<br>
Thus, treating others with the modicum of respect that characterizes civilization is more than simply a homily to good manners.
