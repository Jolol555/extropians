This is a great post by Mike Darwin on the harrowing situation people interested in cryonics can find themselves when very dependant on government aid.

Subject: Spend Down
<br>
<p>Driven from the Pack asks:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Does anyone have any comments on the possible impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of life insurance policies as noted above?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How about in the case where the cryo org (e.g., Alcor)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;owns&quot; the policy, but the cryonicist makes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  payments?
</em><br>
<p>The problem Jan Cotzee describes is very real and it does apply to the 
<br>
elderly. In fact, $2,000 in assets are allowed to be retained by Medicare, 
<br>
but no more. You must spend down to this level of assets before government 
<br>
financial assistance will kick in.
<br>
<p>If you intend to transfer assets to avoid spend down this must have been done 
<br>
TWO YEARS prior to the start of the illness that causes government assistance 
<br>
to become necessary. Otherwise, as Jan points out, ALL assets can and likely 
<br>
will be seized, including insurance money. Further, persons receiving assets 
<br>
to avoid spend down may have their own assets seized or wages garnished.
<br>
<p>If Alcor or your cryonics society owns your policy *and there is no buy back 
<br>
agreement* then you can escape asset seizure and spendown if the transfer was 
<br>
made 2 years before the illness... If you have executed a buyback agreement 
<br>
then the insurance is fair game for the government. If any attorney tells you 
<br>
otherwise, they are mistaken. I discussed this issue with HHS and California 
<br>
DHS officials repeatedly. A buy-back agreement is a tactic that has been used 
<br>
for insurance and other assets in similar contexts (including prepaid funeral 
<br>
arrangements) and has been found to violate the law. The assets will be 
<br>
confiscated if they are discovered. This might even happen after 
<br>
cryopreservation has occurred for several years. It happens routinely to 
<br>
families who have made such transfers and the Feds or State officials find 
<br>
out within the status of limitations (which is, I believe, 5 years, possibly 
<br>
7).
<br>
<p>The IRS can seize any assets at any time for taxes owed, including insurance, 
<br>
even after the death benefit has been paid. They are quite ruthless about 
<br>
this; I've seen it done several times in non-cryonics situations. (It pays to 
<br>
investigate the tax status of the person you got a bequest from before you 
<br>
spend it!)
<br>
<p>This kind of tactic used to be less common, however due to drug laws and 
<br>
tightened control over all aspects of banking and money handling the IRS and 
<br>
the Feds in general can track every dollar and every asset. They are getting 
<br>
remarkably good at this.
<br>
<p>I have a fair amount of experience in this area (recent) because of friends 
<br>
with HIV who are in support groups and because I am in a support group for 
<br>
SOs of people with terminal illnesses. You learn a lot by listening to the 
<br>
horror stories of others. Also, the social workers are very helpful in 
<br>
providing detailed information, and additional first hand horror stories.
<br>
<p>Big Brother is definitely here, NOW.
