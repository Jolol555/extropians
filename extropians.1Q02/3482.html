</em><br>
<p><p>The &quot;lunar landscape&quot; region is in southern Nevada where the state really
<br>
does become barren wasteland with odd rock formations and sand.  The
<br>
northern half of Nevada is generally forested mountains with valleys ranging
<br>
from desert scrub flats to lush meadows depending on the situation.  The
<br>
further north you go, the wetter it gets.  Northern Nevada moves 3-4 million
<br>
foot-acres a year, but it is very broadly distributed.
<br>
<p>(Size comparison for people that haven't been there:  the State of Nevada is
<br>
slightly smaller than the country of Germany)

<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As a bonus, Nevada is second only to Alaska in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I'd have to dispute this statement about libertarians. NH has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had more state legislators elected from the Libertarian Party than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other state, last I checked.
</em><br>
<p><p>Spike was talking about libertarian principles, not the Libertarian party
<br>
i.e. which States have laws and governance that are closest to libertarian
<br>
ideals.  If you elected five Libertarians to the state legislature in
<br>
California, you would have more than Nevada but there is no comparison as to
<br>
which state is more libertarian in practice.
