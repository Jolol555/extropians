As a first cut at it we can assume all of the collisions are elastic
<br>
and frictionless.  This is not a very good estimate since cars are
<br>
designed to crumple and absorb energy, and you're not made of rubber
<br>
either, but can give us a ballpark figure.
<br>
<p>When the 4000 pound car travelling at 35 mph hits the 3000 pound minivan,
<br>
if the collision were elastic and no energy was lost in the crushing
<br>
metal, the result would be the minivan going at 40 mph.
<br>
<p>When this 40 mph minivan then hits your 220 pound body, the result is
<br>
you getting bounced forward at a speed of 75 mph!
<br>
<p>If you figure the minivan is going slower, it will still be approximately
<br>
true that you are given an impact which would send you forward at almost
<br>
twice the minivan speed, if you were made of rubber.
<br>
<p>Most of this impact is absorbed by your body and represents energy
<br>
imparted to you.  So you take the minivan speed after the collision,
<br>
multiply by about 1.8 to get your velocity, then do 1/2 * m * v^2 to
<br>
get the energy you received.
<br>
<p>If you figure the minivan was really going maybe only 20 mph after the
<br>
collision then you'd be given an impact which would send you off at
<br>
about 37 mph, essentially all of which energy gets absorbed by your
<br>
body both when the minivan hits it and when you fall to the ground.
<br>
<p>Converting to metric units, this is a velocity of about 13.5 m/s and
<br>
a mass of 100 kg, for a total of about 13700 Joules of energy.
