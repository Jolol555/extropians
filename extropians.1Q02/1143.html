<p><p>BY MATTHEW PARRIS
<br>
<p>Has God had a good war this year? Has the new century started well for
<br>
religious belief? As the last closed, politicians were talking about what
<br>
they called the “faith community”; after September 2001, how is that
<br>
community doing? How high, at the end of this strange and shocking chapter,
<br>
is deism’s stock? The smoke has cleared in New York. Western man has
<br>
witnessed a mad tragedy actuated by faith. But it is not clear whether for
<br>
most people this only underlines the need for a true God — to save us from
<br>
the false ones — or whether gods, all gods, were the problem, not the
<br>
solution. Never mind me: I am a convinced unbeliever. But what do my
<br>
countrymen think? I listened to two old men, I would guess from lower
<br>
middle-class backgrounds, talking on the train to Derby last month. Their
<br>
discussion was typical of many I have overheard. They were discussing the
<br>
day’s news: more violence in the Middle East.
<br>
<p>“Them Israelis ...” began the one.
<br>
<p>“Zionists,” added the other, by way of elaboration.
<br>
<p>“Zionists, as you say. They’re just stirring it up, like, when they should
<br>
be cooling it down.”
<br>
<p>“Fanatics.”
<br>
<p>“Exactly. Their religion, innit? God’s chosen people, they think. Can’t see
<br>
no argument other than their own. Mind you, them Palestinians, they’re not
<br>
much better. That man — you know ... the one with a tea-towel ...”
<br>
<p>“Arafat.”
<br>
<p>“Yes, him. No better, is ’e? Thinks Allah’s on the Arabs’ side. Won’t bend.
<br>
Little children throwing stones in the name of religion — I ask you.”
<br>
<p>“Fierce people those Muslims — from birth. Stop at nothing.”
<br>
<p>“Fanatics. Look at that Osmara — Osama — whatever — Ben Laden. Thinks there’
<br>
s virgins waiting for ’im in Paradise. ’Ow many? 72 was it? Or 77? Bloody
<br>
ridiculous.”
<br>
<p>“Cause of all these wars and terrorism and things. Christians too, just as
<br>
bad, some of ’em. Look at Ireland. Grown men chucking rocks at little girls
<br>
walking to their school ... sane men and women, or so they’d have you
<br>
believe, claiming it’s God’s will ...”
<br>
<p>“Y’know, Mick, I think religion’s at the bottom of all this. Don’t do no
<br>
good at all.”
<br>
<p>Or that was the drift. The sentiments are not new — they come muttering
<br>
through history — but the confidence with which they are being expressed is
<br>
fresh, voiced widely by morally conservative people from whom you would not
<br>
expect it. Winter 2001 is not a time to express visionary religious views at
<br>
dinner parties. Religion took a knock of sorts, in 2001.
<br>
<p>I do mean religion — all religion: the generic term.
<br>
<p>Critics might excuse the local vicar and his congregation of six kindly old
<br>
ladies, but otherwise tend to lump together the Church Militant, Islam of
<br>
every sort, Jews in hats on the Sabbath, Hindus with their caste system,
<br>
Mormons and Adventists, people with tambourines, Roman Catholics and their
<br>
views on contraception.
<br>
<p>This is of course unfair. Hardly had the dust from the World Trade Centre
<br>
settled before every responsible leader, from Tony Blair down, was making
<br>
the point that this was “not about Islam”. We were all but told to believe
<br>
it was not about religion at all. We were to understand (variously) that
<br>
this was about fundamentalist as opposed to mainstream Islam; that this was
<br>
not even about fundamentalist, but about about madcap Islam; that this was
<br>
nothing whatsoever to do with Islam but the work of pure evil which had
<br>
“hijacked” a religious argument; or that this was not about Islam properly
<br>
interpreted, but that unfortunately some Muslims had misunderstood — and it
<br>
would be helpful if mainstream Islam would condemn a little louder, and so
<br>
on.
<br>
<p>Very similar arguments are made by moderate Jews and Christians about the
<br>
Likud Party and their policies in Israel: that Ariel Sharon’s beliefs and
<br>
the militancy of the West Bank settlers are not inspired by Judaism properly
<br>
understood; that they are not inspired by the Judaism most Jews follow; or
<br>
that they are not inspired by Judaism at all.
<br>
<p>And so it is with the Christians: sectarian hatred in Ireland (we are
<br>
variously told) is based on warped versions of Christianity; based on
<br>
authentic but extreme versions of Christianity; or not based on Christianity
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p>Fair as some of these arguments may be, they spit into the wind of popular
<br>
understanding. The word which public imagination selects to describe the
<br>
relationship between a faith which brutalises, and a faith of the same name
<br>
which does not, is “extreme”. In the public mind, mainstream religions may
<br>
exhibit “extreme” (or “fanatical”) versions engendering fierce belief; and
<br>
“moderate” versions engendering less passionate belief, whose practitioners
<br>
are therefore prepared to act reasonably. In other words, “extreme” religion
<br>
is a strong version of the weaker mainstream variety. Reasonableness in
<br>
religion comes from a lack of total commitment.
<br>
<p>The logic here makes some unfair jumps. We all know good people whose faith
<br>
is theologically mild, yet fiercely held. Even in the theological middle it
<br>
is possible to be passionate and devout.
<br>
<p>But that is not the rule. Faith as observed in practice usually supports the
<br>
popular simplification: the more consuming is a person’s religious
<br>
commitment, the more likely he is to hold views we think “extreme”. Tony
<br>
Blair and the Archbishop of Canterbury may insist all they like that
<br>
“fundamentalist” versions of faiths do not “besmirch” the mainstream
<br>
version; the public will see it differently. We will see fundamentalism as
<br>
the full monty, the mainstream as Religion-Lite. History suggests the same:
<br>
the world’s great faiths have tended to be reformed and reinvigorated by
<br>
sects driven by a zeal to return to basics. You therefore cannot just
<br>
dismiss fundamentalists as irrelevant weirdos: their beliefs will often be
<br>
telling you about something hard at the core of the softer, mainstream
<br>
versions of the religion.
<br>
<p>That, at least, is what (I believe) most people suspect. In the public mind
<br>
in Britain, Islamic fundamentalism — and to a lesser extent sectarianism in
<br>
Ireland and the Religious Right in Israel — have done much damage to the
<br>
reputation of three of Britain’s major faiths.
<br>
<p>If you doubt it, look at recent parliamentary and public reaction to the
<br>
Cabinet’s plan for the proliferation of “faith schools”. I simply observe
<br>
that national disquiet at the whole idea has taken the Government by
<br>
surprise. In the Commons the Education Secretary, Estelle Morris, has looked
<br>
quite winded at the attacks from behind her and across the floor.
<br>
<p>There has been a strong anti-clerical streak beneath this anger. The same
<br>
streak is discernible in opposition to the Government’s plans to protect
<br>
religion from those who would incite hatred against it — plans the Home
<br>
Secretary has been forced to drop. Read the debates: Voltaire would have
<br>
been proud of the scorn expressed.
<br>
<p>I believe there is something quite new in this anti-clericalism among the
<br>
political class, or at least in its confidence. Agnosticism (for that is
<br>
what it is) used mostly to be expressed rather apologetically in Parliament,
<br>
or left unexpressed. A few years ago you would not, by two small measures
<br>
calculated to protect and foster faith, have roused anything like such
<br>
indignation.
<br>
<p>Yet I hinted at the start that my question — How is religion faring? — was
<br>
not easy to answer. Nor is it. I write this from America. Here, clear and
<br>
uncontestable published evidence points to a revival of public interest in
<br>
religion since September 11, especially in the more evangelical versions of
<br>
Christianity.
<br>
<p>Stronger commitments from some, then, and stronger antipathy from others.
<br>
Could things be coming to a head? Could we be seeing a polarisation of
<br>
public attitudes to faith? For more than a century now the dominant attitude
<br>
in the Western world has been an apathy which I would describe as covert
<br>
agnosticism masquerading as weak observance. Is Osama bin Laden flushing
<br>
this agnosticism out? If so, we may see an increase both in the religious
<br>
enthusiasm of the minority, and the avowed scepticism of the majority. When
<br>
it comes to the relationship between modern man and religious faith, the
<br>
century now beginning may prove make-up-your-mind time. I hope so.
