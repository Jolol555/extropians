</em><br>
<p>I think one of the best ways to inject positive extropic memes into the
<br>
public is through television media. While ST:TNG's Borg race injected
<br>
much negativity into ideas of augmentation and human perfectability, the
<br>
later Star Trek Voyager's character Seven of Nine, played by the highly
<br>
attractive Jeri Ryan as a cleaned up and re-individualized borg who
<br>
retains her borg training and some of its technology did much for the
<br>
idea of perfectability as an individual, consensual goal, while
<br>
retaining much abhorrence for the coercive collectivism of the Borg
<br>
culture.
<br>
<p>Given that Paramount is open to developing scripts from outside writers,
<br>
it would, I think, be a good idea, I think, to write a new character for
<br>
the Star Trek: Enterprise series into a script that portrays an
<br>
individual with a healthy avocation of pursuit for individual
<br>
optimization and perfection. I'm rather disturbed that the luddites seem
<br>
to have more influence in the new series, as evidenced by the presence
<br>
of the Sulabon race, represented by individuals who are corrupted by
<br>
evil time travellers in the pursuit of genetic/physical/mental
<br>
perfection. So far we have only seen one 'good' Sulabon character in one
<br>
episode. Perhaps we need to write in a new crewman who is Sulabon and a
<br>
member of the majority of Sulabon society, who pursue improvement and
<br>
perfection as consensual individuals. S/he would serve on the Enterprise
<br>
as a sort of scout/intelligence liason in it's continuing conflict with
<br>
the time criminals.
