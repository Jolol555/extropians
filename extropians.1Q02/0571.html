<p>
<em>&gt; ... as someone who has expressed my democratic socialist views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Extropy list at various points over the last eight years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and been routinely flamed, I think he was fair to observe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Extrop list did not often have left of center views expressed.
</em><br>
<p>That statement is self-contradictory.  You say that you've
<br>
expressed views a lot and that they weren't expressed: the former
<br>
is true; the views were expressed, often.  They were also
<br>
criticized, often.  Isn't that the whole point of discourse?
<br>
Liberal democratic views are quite common and powerful both
<br>
here and in Europe, so they hardly need white-glove treatment
<br>
here.  It's the minority libertarian views that need the most
<br>
vocal support, and some of us are committed to providing it.
<br>
We express those views as you express yours, and we expect
<br>
(and welcome) criticism of them, which has also been quite
<br>
common on this list.
<br>
<p>If you don't think political ideas should be criticized
<br>
when they are offered, then you're no Extropian.
<br>
