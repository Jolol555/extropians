<p><p><em>&gt; Simon McClenahan wrote (13.2.2002/12:46) :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The key to fast reading of screen-rendered text is in the scrolling. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;page&quot; at a time is far too much for our meager visual cortex to handle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Other speed-reading techniques require more motor control, such as your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hands, applied to a more manageable 3-D object such as a book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think manual scrolling is compatible with fast, effortless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading. All moving of the text brings effort to the brain (mine at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least). It is not the moving of the eye which is an effort, the effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not muscular, it is computational.
</em><br>
<p>I think of the act of reading as more of a skill. We aren't born with an
<br>
instinctual desire to read text, and up to this point in time you have
<br>
trained yourself to read in a particular manner at your current efficiency.
<br>
If you change your manner, you could very likely lose efficiency, at least
<br>
initially, but like any other skill you need to train yourself and adapt to
<br>
a new method.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Automatic scrolling is even worse, as the speed at which you read must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course adapt to what you're reading. When you get to the middle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a paragraph and you got the idea and you predict that nothing will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added in the rest, you go to the next paragraph.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You need the page to stand still if you are to move fast and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfortably.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you scroll at paragraph granularity, that would obviously not be
<br>
acceptable - unless your brain has addapted to that speed, where some people
<br>
can actually read whole pages at a time. It's not impossible, it just
<br>
requires training.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I suspect that the automatic scrolling thing is adapted to people for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whom reading means reading aloud without the sound and listening to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sounds they don't make with their inner ear :-)
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;inner ear&quot; vocalization is known as sub-vocal. Some people may even
<br>
move their mouths without making sound.
<br>
<p>All my (limited) knowledge of speed-reading comes from the canonical book by
<br>
Evelyn Wood. There are plenty of sites to Google at, the first one that
<br>
looks like an interesting summary is <a href="http://www.evelynwood.com.au/">http://www.evelynwood.com.au/</a> . No
<br>
doubt there are many other techniques that an individual could train
<br>
themselves with, but I think there is even less computer software available
<br>
that would teach or assist in these known techniques or create new
<br>
techniques specifically for 2-D non-kinetic and silent reading on a vertical
<br>
screen.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Funn(nnnn)ily, reading is one of those things which is actually not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught. Children are taught to read aloud, and then left to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to read for themselves. Some find good ways to do it, other don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Among the latter, some only learn to switch off the sound. Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stumble later on a &quot;fast reading&quot; book. It's all left to improvisation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and chance.
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't agree with you more. The same goes for reasoning and creativity,
<br>
IMHO.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's how teaching now &quot;works&quot; : you test children again and again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until they figure out a way to pass the test ; you actually never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teach them THAT, and some never learn. The only thing that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught is left to complete improvisation, and that accounts for huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences between individuals, because some find great tricks and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-tricks with which the readily build feats of cognition, and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are stuck with unefficient tricks.
</em><br>
<p>Amen.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A teacher should model his pupil's mind and actually help it to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself further. He should suggest useful tricks for the pupil to try,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopt and combine.
</em><br>
<p>Such as computer-assisted automatic scrolling software, or manual frequent
<br>
periodical (e.g. 1 second) clicking of the mouse or the down arrow key as
<br>
they read to help speed them up? ;-)
<br>
<p><p><p>This type of discussion we are having is more along the lines of should
<br>
humans adapt to computers, or computers adapt to humans, or should
<br>
&quot;compromises&quot; be performed by both computer and human. My vote will always
<br>
go for the latter, but I guess it really is a balancing act.
<br>
<p><p>cheers,
<br>
