<p><p><p>Are you denying that people today, even quite a few right here

in the US of A, have insufficient clothing, housing and

What you say may be true but it does not automatically work out 
<br>
that everyone gets what they need or the means to earn what they 
<br>
need either.  That is my point.  What do you think should be 
<br>
done in such cases?  Are our theories of how it should work out 
<br>
to be clung to even while people, some of them children in our 
<br>
own country, are in this shape?   I see the arguments for the 
<br>
goodness of the theory and I see the suffering ones at the same 
<br>
time.  I do not know if I have the best answer but I think I 
<br>
have a very valid question that cannot be easily swept aside by 
<br>
mere theory.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Those who need those things must (1) become producers, which
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply and decreasing demand drives prices down, (3) become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predators, stealing from the productive (such as becoming a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government).  Setting aside (3) for the moment, bargaining for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods produced by others can only become easier as technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances, to the point where a &quot;job&quot; consisting of nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking goods off producer's hands might be enough to bargain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them.  A person might have to do nothing more than fill
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, it isn't at this time so.  So again, while it is not so 
<br>
should these people continue to suffer and perhaps die?  Should 
<br>
children be allowed to be so malnourished, even in a country as 
<br>
rich as ours, that their brains are seriously damaged thus 
<br>
making even more suffering and burden?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; out a marketing survey for some company once a month to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough money to live comfortably for the month (of course, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who are fabulously wealthy by today's standards will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lament their abject poverty just as the so-called poor today
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Go look at the homeless and then claim this.  Go look at the 
<br>
projects a bit more closely.  Look into the some of the 
<br>
one-parent homes that now do not qualify for welfare and can 
<br>
find no work or source of income equal to what they once had. 
<br>
Are you ignoring them or claiming they don't exist or that they 
<br>
are not relevant?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, most people will have skillsand talents that allow them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large enough share of the produced goods that they can afford
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; so as rationally self-interested charity, to reduce the amount

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; downwind.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Sorry.  The real world does not work like your ideals.  Not even 
<br>
here.  Certainly not in less developed countries.  So what 
<br>
happens to these people while we wait for your theory to work? 
<br>
What happens if your theory is wrong?
