<p>Yes. The problem is that most people are perfectly incompetent at
<br>
calculating their real risks in life. When you make statements like
<br>
&quot;Doctors are charlatans whose services are not worth the paper their
<br>
degrees are printed on&quot;, or &quot;Health insurance is nothing more than a
<br>
primate grooming habit&quot;, or &quot;Government is highly overrated&quot;, or &quot;Police
<br>
are more dangerous to law abiding citizens than to criminals&quot;, they look
<br>
at you like you have two heads, with green skin and propeller beanies on
<br>
each head. It doesn't matter if you are exactly correct, they just are
<br>
unable to believe you.
