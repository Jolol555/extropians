Purpose is a human idea, it lies only within the questioner, or simply, it
<br>
is what you think it is

Subject: The Quest for the Purpose of Life
<br>
<p><p>: Topic Question: &quot;What is the meaning/purpose of life?&quot;
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: Unfortunately, due to the limitations of my finite knowledge and existence
<br>
I cannot answer this question adequately. I had yet to figure out fully what
<br>
the meaning of life.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: The quest for the meaning of life does not seek to discard or to preserve
<br>
older answers to this question.
<br>
:
<br>
: It transcends ethics for one must define this meaning to define ethics. It
<br>
goes beyond religions because it does not have any concept of monopoly. It
<br>
should not rest solely with science and mathematics because of Gödel's
<br>
Theorem, which tells us we cannot know everything. It can concern the soul,
<br>
but should not rely on it for its validity.
<br>
:
<br>
: It would not provide an excuse for inaction because it should motivate us
<br>
to do whatever we discovered we should do. It should not have to explain the
<br>
past (where we have ignorance) but to guide our actions in the present and
<br>
the future.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: Rather than live from day to day without meaning, it asks us to take time
<br>
to reflect and ask ourselves about the meta-goals and meta-purpose of our
<br>
lives. Asking this simple question seriously of &quot;Why do I exist and what
<br>
should I do?&quot; seems like the most neglected activity in modern society.
<br>
:
<br>
: To keep true to this quest, one should avoid unnecessary associations with
<br>
previous established schools of thought on this topic nor to assert one's
<br>
belief of the meaning of life over others.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: I have some candidates:
<br>
:
<br>
: - Knowledge: We exist to learn, both about our inner world and our outer
<br>
world, even if we could never achieve this goal. We should boldly go where
<br>
none has gone before. The theory of the Universe as a Computer Simulation
<br>
seems to imply this.
<br>
:
<br>
: - Self-actualization: We should strive to maximize our time in the &quot;flow&quot;
<br>
state where we achieve the optimum level and amount of challenges.
<br>
:
<br>
: - Subjective: Everyone has their own meaning in life, if they seek it.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: Questionable but probable:
<br>
:
<br>
: - Death: The meaning of life lies with death, for all things that exist
<br>
must eventually crease to exist. No entity can expect to live forever, and
<br>
so we should get on with our fear of death and do whatever we think we must
<br>
do. If so, voluntary dying would help achieve such a purpose.
<br>
:
<br>
: - Happiness: We have purpose when we have happiness. Taking an emotional
<br>
altering drug without side-effects might help (like &quot;soma&quot; in the &quot;Brave New
<br>
World&quot;).
<br>
:
<br>
: - Null: The question has no validity. Life has no meaning. We just exist.
<br>
This does not answer the question or perhaps it replaces this with another
<br>
question.
<br>
:
<br>
: - Serving metaphysical entities: We have to serve certain entities or an
<br>
entity. Especially when such entities somehow do not directly communicate
<br>
with us, we might have to ask what the entity/entities want us to do. Even
<br>
more so, we may wonder why the entity wants us to do these things as we
<br>
would have to ask about the purpose of its existence (which we would have to
<br>
help attain). This certainly invites more questions than answers.
<br>
:
<br>
: - The Quest itself: What if God (if He exists) have a wield sense of
<br>
humor? We might well find such a question as its own answer!
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: May the force be with you.
