<p>ON THE HISTORY OF EUGENICS IN THE US
<br>
History contains many instances of the ignoble application of
<br>
science, and one of the most disastrous examples is that of the
<br>
so-called science of &quot;eugenics&quot; in the first half of the 20th
<br>
century. Recent major advances in molecular genetics and genetics
<br>
biotechnology have produced in some quarters a &quot;genetics
<br>
euphoria&quot;, with many researchers rushing to establish the
<br>
&quot;genetic basis&quot; of various human &quot;behavior traits&quot;, the latter
<br>
term encompassing, by implication, both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; behavior
<br>
traits. Can we expect a proposed therapeutic program to eliminate
<br>
genetically based &quot;bad behavior traits&quot;? History suggests extreme
<br>
caution is necessary.
<br>
... ... Garland E. Allen (Washington University St. Louis, US)
<br>
discussed the history of eugenics in the US, the author making
<br>
the following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The term &quot;eugenics&quot; was coined in 1883 by the Victorian
<br>
polymath Francis Galton (1822-1911), geographer, statistician,
<br>
and first cousin of Charles Darwin (1809-1882). To Galton, the
<br>
term meant &quot;truly- or well-born&quot;, and referred to a plan to
<br>
encourage the &quot;best people&quot; in society to have more children
<br>
(positive eugenics) and to discourage or prevent the &quot;worst
<br>
elements&quot; of society from having many, if any, children (negative
<br>
eugenics). Eugenics became solidified into a movement in various
<br>
countries throughout the world in the first three decades of the
<br>
20th century, but nowhere more solidly than in the US and, after
<br>
World War I, in Germany.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) During the first three decades of the 20th century,
<br>
eugenicists attempted to analyze the inheritance of traits by
<br>
using correlation studies between relatives and studies of family
<br>
pedigree charts. The basic assumption was that if a trait
<br>
recurred in families over several generations, it must be
<br>
genetic. For example, the American eugenicist Charles B.
<br>
Davenport, director of the Station for Experimental Evolution and
<br>
the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island,
<br>
New York, constructed elaborate pedigrees for Huntington's
<br>
chorea, albinism, epilepsy, feeblemindedness, and thalassophilia
<br>
or &quot;love of the sea&quot; (which he found to be a Mendelian sex-linked
<br>
recessive trait especially prominent in the families of naval
<br>
officers). Harry H. Laughlin, superintendent of the Eugenics
<br>
Record Office, studied the inheritance of criminality,
<br>
feeblemindedness, and many other deleterious traits in different
<br>
ethnic and racial groups. He concluded that eastern Europeans,
<br>
Mediterraneans, and Russian Jews, among others, harbored a large
<br>
number of defective genes in their populations. Such studies,
<br>
sprinkled with anecdotes, formed the backbone of eugenic
<br>
&quot;science&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) American eugenicists also worked to establish eugenics-
<br>
based legislation in the US. Laughlin was appointed &quot;Expert
<br>
Eugenics Witness&quot; to the House Committee on Immigration and
<br>
Naturalization in 1921. His prison and hospital data were
<br>
critical in convincing the Committee that America's germ plasm
<br>
was being weakened by mixing with the lower quality genes coming
<br>
from southern and eastern Europe, the Balkans, and Russia. This
<br>
led to passage of the Johnson-Reed Act in 1924, which restricted
<br>
immigration from these regions. Laughlin and others also lobbied
<br>
at the state level for the passage of eugenic sterilization laws,
<br>
which would allow individuals in state institutions to be
<br>
forcibly sterilized if they were judged to be genetically
<br>
defective. More than 35 states passed and used such laws, and by
<br>
the 1960s, when most of these laws were beginning to be repealed,
<br>
more than 60,000 people in the US had been sterilized for eugenic
<br>
purposes. In Germany, the National Socialists (Nazis) used
<br>
Laughlin's model as one of the bases of their sweeping
<br>
sterilization law of 1933, which ultimately led to the
<br>
sterilization of over 400,000 people.
<br>

<br>
[Editor's note: The US eugenics movement did not wither away
<br>
easily. As late as the 1960s, noted biologist and endocrinologist
<br>
Dwight J. Ingle (1907-?), member of the US National Academy of
<br>
Sciences and Chairman of the Department of Physiology at the
<br>
University of Chicago, founder and long-time editor of the
<br>
influential journal _Perspectives in Biology and Medicine_,
<br>
continued calling in widely read published articles for the mass
<br>
eugenic sterilization of American blacks to prevent &quot;weakening&quot;
<br>
of the US Caucasian germ pool. A similar public call for mass
<br>
eugenic sterilization of blacks was made during that time and
<br>
later by the noted physicist and engineer and Nobel laureate
<br>
William B. Shockley (1910-1989) (also a member of the US National
<br>
Academy of Sciences). Memoirs concerning Shockley in current
<br>
science publications rarely mention his socio-political
<br>
activities in the 1960s and later; the journal _Perspectives in
<br>
Biology and Medicine_ currently maintains a &quot;Dwight J. Ingle
<br>
Memorial Award&quot;. In 1980, Shockley revealed that he had
<br>
contributed some of his 70-year-old sperm cells for the purpose
<br>
of freezing the sperm for eventual use in the insemination of
<br>
women of high intelligence. All of which brings to mind a
<br>
statement by the biochemist Erwin Chargaff, published in of all
<br>
places the journal _Perspectives in Biology and Medicine_ (1973):
<br>
&quot;Outside his own ever-narrowing field of specialization, a
<br>
scientist is a layman. What members of an academy of science have
<br>
in common is a certain form of semiparasitic living.&quot; Dwight J.
<br>
Ingle was still editor of the journal at the time Chargaff's
<br>
statement was published.]
