<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;This morning's SJ Merc has an article about a widow from

<em>&gt; I was delighted to see the Texas legislature having to face this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down.  One imagine the cowboy lawyers sitting around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;Boys, we either hafta recognize the legitimacy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transgender surgery or the legitimacy of homosexual marriage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we recognize neither, then we are saying the transgender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has not the human right to marry, implying that the transgender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not human.  The brain makes the human, so we would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that the brain resides in that organ that was removed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transgender surgery.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>I think the correct term is &quot;transsexual surgery&quot; as it is 
<br>
usually on the transsexual sub-group of transgender individuals 
<br>
that are eligible for and/or desire such surgery.  Gender is 
<br>
orthogonal to sexuality of course so the issues should never 
<br>
have been conflated to start with.  If the state wants to impose 
<br>
a &quot;gender test&quot; then it gets in deep do-do real fast with all 
<br>
the varieties of human physical, brain and psychological gender. 
<br>
A TS woman in a relationship with a non-TS man is not in any 
<br>
sense in a homosexual relationship.  Even the passport people 
<br>
are happy to stamp an &quot;F&quot; on a male-to-female transsexual's 
<br>
passport on proof of surgery.  But the good state of Texas, or 
<br>
some local good old boys on the bench anyway, think they know 
<br>
better.  I guess the &quot;Transsexual Menace&quot; group will just have 
<br>
to pay them a visit.  I don't think the &quot;Texas T-Party&quot; is very 
<br>
happy about the situation either.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of those states that decided acknowledge transgender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage only and not homosexual marriage, some will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopelessly bogged down in the details.  For instance, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what stage of gender transformation does the person become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the target gender?  Whenever they say?  Does a doctor need
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, for transsexuals (again somewhat distinct from the much 
<br>
larger transgender superclass), different states have different 
<br>
policies on name change, when gender is changed on the driver's 
<br>
license, when you can get married to a person of the opposite 
<br>
gender, whether you would be thrown into the men or women's jail 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if jailed and so on.  Most change the driver's license with a 
<br>
doctor's recommendation and after &quot;chemical castration&quot; meaning 
<br>
that the person has been on hormones long enough to no longer be 
<br>
functional in the old gender sexually and/or to be significantly 
<br>
developed in the direction of the target gender.  Most I am 
<br>
aware of go by what is between your legs (born that way or from 
<br>
surgery makes no difference) when deciding which jail to toss 
<br>
you into, which has put more than one pre-op in a world of hurt 
<br>
and great danger.  A lot of cops think anyone not fully &quot;normal&quot; 
<br>
in their estimation is simply &quot;queer&quot; as does a lot of the 
<br>
population having little more than &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; to go on. 
<br>
Name change varies from state to state.  Changing sex on the 
<br>
birth certificate varies from state to state and some states 
<br>
simply won't do so in any circumstances.  Passport stuff is 
<br>
uniform in the US as far as I know.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; to declare the transformation more than halfway done?  Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it be *any* doctor, including one who is him/herself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transgender?  Or what about a case like my cousin, born
</em><br>
<p><p>If the doctor is credentialed then it is irrelevant whether they 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are transgendered or not.  Accusations of bias should not be 
<br>
made arbitrarily.  Some of the best doctors and psychologists 
<br>
out there dealing with transgender, inter-sexed and transsexual 
<br>
issues are transgendered and specialized simply because they 
<br>
wanted to contribute to others who were going through the same 
<br>
stuff they did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ambiguously gender raised male, who married an ambiguous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gender raised female?  And what if a transgender male to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; female wishes to marry a transgender female to male?  Would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they not be a legitimate hetero marriage either way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Looks like it to me.  Of course those who have problems with all 
<br>
that &quot;wierd stuff&quot; will consider it just plain &quot;queer&quot; either 
<br>
way and thus forbidden or ignored and declared null and void 
<br>
whenever someone takes a mind to.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It will bring me much joy and laughter to read the body of law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus derived by some of those stodgy conservative southern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states trying to grapple with these issues.  Perhaps most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states simply say eventually: marry whomever you want,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with our unconditional blessing.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Yeah.  And maybe they need at least 5 gender categories (a la 
<br>
some sci-fi stories) while they are about it.  Or perhaps they 
<br>
will simply make specifying gender on most state forms as 
<br>
optional as specifying race or ethnicity.
