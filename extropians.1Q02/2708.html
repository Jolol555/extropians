<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In Florida, carrying large sums of cash, say over $10,000, is legally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defined as &quot;suspicious&quot;.  The police can and do seize such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cash under the assumption that it is drug money.  The cash can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be retrieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only if the person can prove where it came from and that it was obtained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legally.  Any unexplained cash that is not later retrieved is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply kept by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, yes, of course. Not that I like it, but this is an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational argument to make, because if you kept that amount of cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside of a bank account, then you must be trying to hide it from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government for some reason. At the very least you are trying to evade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax laws, at worst you are engaging in illicit trade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also rational to assume that if you got that amount of cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimately, you should be able to demonstrate with receipt records who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you got it from and for what... at which point you'll be asked to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes on it...  of course, the fact that many businesses deal in far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater sums every day has no bearing... a legitimate business is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed to keep the sort of records that would show how the money was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earned ;)
</em><br>
<p>Feh. Doesn't it seem a little ironic that in this allegedly capitalist
<br>
society, you're not allowed to move money around? It isn't just Florida, by
<br>
the way. Any and all cash transactions of $10,000 or more are routinely
<br>
flagged -- try it sometime if you have no worries about ending up in the
<br>
national drug enforcement database as a potential dealer.
<br>
<p>My ex-in-laws are in the paper money business -- auctioning obsolete US
<br>
currency (funnily enough, there's an article up on mises.org about just
<br>
that). Baseball cards for rich people, a collectibles market for those with
<br>
hundreds of thousands of dollars to put down on that one-of-a-kind 1850's
<br>
color print. A rich and funny history, too, as early notes were often
<br>
defaced or enhanced to get across a political point (I have a cute little
<br>
1866 10c bill in which the portrait has been carefully and artistically
<br>
painted over with pointy ears, goatee, a red cowl, hat and horns -- souvenir
<br>
of my time as a trade assistant).
<br>
<p>But I digress. Anyhow, since all paper currency printed since the umpteenth
<br>
set of banking reforms in the 1920s is still legal tender (officially, but
<br>
don't try it at home unless you want to end up on charges of passing false
<br>
currency) -- and looks more or less like current bills -- collectors have to
<br>
be very careful about how they transport these things for auctions and
<br>
shows. More than one collector has been arrested because of the transport
<br>
laws -- a particularly funny (in hindsight) story involves an auction item
<br>
from four years ago; someone had dug up a suitcase in their attic filled
<br>
with 1930s, 40s and 50s play money. Monopoly, dolls sets, other games,
<br>
standalone toys, you name it. Millions of dollars of various noncurrencies
<br>
in faded primary colors. So the whole shebang was to be sold as a single
<br>
lot, suitcase and all -- there are collectors who go for this sort of
<br>
found-in-the-attic chic. (Hell, there are collectors who collect hollowed
<br>
out stacks of bills for dye bombs, but each to their own...there was a stack
<br>
in which the bomb had gone off that went for several thousand dollars back
<br>
in 1998). Back to the story; so one of the auction company principals, who
<br>
is a big humorous, irreverant guy, heads into the airport (domestic trip, TX
<br>
to FL) with a battered suitcase full of play money. Needless to say, he
<br>
doesn't make it much past the x-ray machine before being picked up by
<br>
airport security. They cracked open the case, and refused to believe that
<br>
all the primary-colored toys were not real tender of some sort, somewhere.
<br>
So they arrested him. Took many hours to resolve all of the resulting
<br>
idiocy, but he was laughing about it by the end of the auction. Hard not to
<br>
with the killing they make on the commission.
<br>
<p>Anyhow. &quot;War on *&quot; = stupid. Not even evil, just stupid, stupid, stupid. We
<br>
live in a sick, controlling society that encourages denial and a lack of
<br>
responsibility, can't look beyond tomorrow, curtails freedoms for idiot
<br>
reasons and looks more and more like the worst of Europe. Career politicians
<br>
are a major source of stupidity, popularity contents are no way to run a
<br>
society. Blah, blah, blah, heard it all before, possibly even from me, what
<br>
are we going to do about it?
<br>
