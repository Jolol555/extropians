Kurzweill in 'Age of spiritual machines' talks of how technology merging
<br>
with biology will slowly be accepted by the masses by starting out as curing
<br>
ailments and disabilities, then moving to mere annoyances and then onto
<br>
augmentation.  Here is an article from Nasa science news that talks about
<br>
artificial photoreceptors, a possible first step in visual related
<br>
technologies.

<p>Using space technology, scientists have developed extraordinary ceramic
<br>
photocells that could repair malfunctioning human eyes.

<p>January 3, 2002: Rods and Cones. Millions of them are in the back of every
<br>
healthy human eye. They are biological solar cells in the retina that
<br>
convert light to electrical impulses -- impulses that travel along the optic
<br>
nerve to the brain where images are formed.
<br>
<p>Without them, we're blind.
<br>
<p>Indeed, many people are blind -- or going blind -- because of malfunctioning
<br>
rods and cones. Retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration are examples
<br>
of two such disorders. Retinitis pigmentosa tends to be hereditary and may
<br>
strike at an early age, while macular degeneration mostly affects the
<br>
elderly. Together, these diseases afflict millions of Americans; both occur
<br>
gradually and can result in total blindness.

<br>
<p>&quot;If we could only replace those damaged rods and cones with artificial
<br>
ones,&quot; says Dr. Alex Ignatiev, a professor at the University of Houston,
<br>
&quot;then a person who is retinally-blind might be able to regain some of their
<br>
sight.&quot;

<br>
Years ago such thoughts were merely wishful. But no longer. Scientists at
<br>
the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) in Houston are experimenting with
<br>
thin, photosensitive ceramic films that respond to light much as rods and
<br>
cones do. Arrays of such films, they believe, could be implanted in human
<br>
eyes to restore lost vision.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are some diseases where the sensors in the eye, the rods and cones,
<br>
have deteriorated but all the wiring is still in place,&quot; says Ignatiev, who
<br>
directs the SVEC. In such cases, thin-film ceramic sensors could serve as
<br>
substitutes for bad rods and cones. The result would be a &quot;bionic eye.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center is a NASA-sponsored Commercial Space Center
<br>
(CSC) at the University of Houston. NASA's Space Product Development (SPD)
<br>
program, located at the Marshall Space Flight Center, encourages the
<br>
commercialization of space by industry through 17 such CSCs. At the SVEC,
<br>
researchers apply knowledge gained from experiments done in space to develop
<br>
better lasers, photocells, and thin films -- technologies with both
<br>
commercial and human promise.
<br>
<p>Below: A schematic diagram of the retina -- a light-sensitive layer that
<br>
covers 65% of the interior surface of the eye. SVEC scientists hope to
<br>
replace damaged rods and cones in the retina with ceramic microdetector
<br>
arrays. Image courtesy A. Ignatiev.
<br>
<p>Scientists at Johns Hopkins University, MIT, and elsewhere have tried to
<br>
build artificial rods and cones before, notes Ignatiev. Most of those
<br>
earlier efforts involved silicon-based photodetectors. But silicon is toxic
<br>
to the human body and reacts unfavorably with fluids in the eye -- problems
<br>
that SVEC's ceramic detectors do not share.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are conducting preliminary tests on the ceramic detectors for
<br>
biocompatibility, and they appear to be totally stable&quot; he says. &quot;In other
<br>
words, the detector does not deteriorate and [neither does] the eye.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;These detectors are thin films, grown atom-by-atom and layer-by-layer on a
<br>
background substrate -- a technique called epitaxy,&quot; continues Ignatiev.
<br>
&quot;Well-ordered, 'epitaxally-grown' films have [the best] optical properties.&quot;
<br>
<p>Crafting such films is a skill SVEC scientists learned from experiments
<br>
conducted using the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) -- a 12-foot diameter
<br>
disk-shaped platform launched from the space shuttle. The WSF was designed
<br>
by SVEC engineers to study epitaxial film growth in the ultra-vacuum of
<br>
space. &quot;We grew thin oxide films using atomic oxygen in low-Earth orbit as a
<br>
natural oxidizing agent,&quot; says Ignatiev. &quot;Those experiments helped us
<br>
develop the oxide (ceramic) detectors we're using now for the Bionic Eye
<br>
project.&quot;
<br>
<p>Right: In 1996, during shuttle mission STS-80, astronauts use Columbia's
<br>
robotic arm to deploy the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center's Wake Shield
<br>
Facility. [more]
<br>
<p>The ceramic detectors are much like ultra-thin films found in modern
<br>
computer chips, &quot;so we can use our semiconductor expertise and make them in
<br>
arrays -- like chips in a computer factory,&quot; he added. The arrays are
<br>
stacked in a hexagonal structure mimicking the arrangement of rods and cones
<br>
they are designed to replace.
<br>
<p>The natural layout of the detectors solves another problem that plagued
<br>
earlier silicon research: blockage of nutrient flow to the eye.
<br>
<p>&quot;All of the nutrients feeding the eye flow from the back to the front,&quot; says
<br>
Ignatiev. &quot;If you implant a large, impervious structure [like the silicon
<br>
detectors] in the eye, nutrients can't flow&quot; and the eye will atrophy. The
<br>
ceramic detectors are individual, five-micron-size units (the exact size of
<br>
cones) that allow nutrients to flow around them.
<br>
<p>Artificial retinas constructed at SVEC consist of 100,000 tiny ceramic
<br>
detectors, each 1/20 the size of a human hair. The assemblage is so small
<br>
that surgeons can't safely handle it. So, the arrays are attached to a
<br>
polymer film one millimeter by one millimeter in size. A couple of weeks
<br>
after insertion into an eyeball, the polymer film will simply dissolve
<br>
leaving only the array behind.
<br>
<p>The first human trials of such detectors will begin in 2002. Dr. Charles
<br>
Garcia of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston will be the
<br>
surgeon in charge.
<br>
<p>&quot;An incision is made in the white portion of the eye and the retina is
<br>
elevated by injecting fluid underneath,&quot; explains Garcia, comparing the
<br>
space to a blister forming on the skin after a burn. &quot;Within that little
<br>
blister, we place the artificial retina.&quot;
<br>
<p>Left: These first-generation ceramic thin film microdetectors, each about 30
<br>
microns in size, are attached to a polymer carrier, which helps surgeons
<br>
handle them. The background image shows human cones 5-10 microns in size in
<br>
a hexagonal array. Image courtesy A. Ignatiev.
<br>
<p>Scientists aren't yet certain how the brain will interpret
<br>
unfamiliar voltages from the artificial rods and cones. They believe the
<br>
brain will eventually adapt, although a slow learning process might be
<br>
necessary -- something akin to the way an infant learns shapes and colors
<br>
for the first time.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a long way from the lab to the clinic,&quot; notes Garcia. &quot;Will they work?
<br>
For how long? And at what level of resolution? We won't know until we
<br>
implant the receptors in patients. The technology is in its infancy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ignatiev has received over 200 requests from patients who learned of the
<br>
studies from earlier press reports. &quot;I'm extremely excited about this,&quot; he
<br>
says. He cautions that much more research is needed, but &quot;it's very
<br>
promising.&quot;
