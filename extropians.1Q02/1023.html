<p>
In a preface intended for the first edition of Animal Farm, George
<br>
Orwell wrote that &quot;at any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body
<br>
of ideas which it is assumed that all right thinking people will
<br>
accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that
<br>
or the other, but it is 'not done' to say it, just as in mid-Victorian
<br>
times it was 'not done' to mention trousers in the presence of a
<br>
lady.&quot; Orwell, of course, was less concerned with sartorial
<br>
observation than with the fog of intellectual fashions, the
<br>
orthodoxies that could induce otherwise liberal and tolerant minds to
<br>
censor public discourse of disagreeable facts and opinions. In what
<br>
remains as a vivid defense of the freedom of the press, he concluded
<br>
that &quot;if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell
<br>
people what they do not want to hear.&quot;
