<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Better yet make it a multiplayer game, replacing much of the simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; decisions by decisions actually made by the human players in the given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; context, and making the experience much more convincing. Any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestion ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's a great idea. Go have a look at A Tale in The Desert for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a MMORPG in development (closed alpha) that focuses on cooperative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rule-based societal development. Ground is already being broken...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.ataleinthedesert.com/">http://www.ataleinthedesert.com/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had a look at this, thanks for the pointer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It looks nice, but it's not what we need.
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course ;) I was illustrating that the viability of mass-appeal
<br>
online games based intentionally and directly on society building is being
<br>
demonstrated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Giving a bit more thought to it, I think that you could make a game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very appeal of which would be the proximity of the game society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the actual society. The incentive to play would be to try out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas one may have about desirable reforms, etc., and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrating their desirability through the game experience.
</em><br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The main idea is : make the game attractive BECAUSE it is close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real society, so that if you manage to do something in the game you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may convince people to do it in the real society. It is this &quot;real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stake&quot; that would make the game sexy (instead of the thrill of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting, or the fantasy and cultural interest).
</em><br>
<p>I had in mind a game in which players are rewarded for creating a stable
<br>
libertarian society. I imagine the following constraints and ideas on
<br>
developing such a game so that it has mass appeal:
<br>
<p>1) the game has to have enough in common with existing MMORPGs to draw in
<br>
their players. A Tale in The Desert as contrasted with, say EverQuest or
<br>
Dark Age of Camelot is a good example of acceptable similarities.
<br>
<p>2) prestige has to accumulate to those players who are successful in game
<br>
terms. In MMORPGs, prestige can come in the form of perks or items that
<br>
other players do not have, increased power of your avatar, access to parts
<br>
of the game that other players do not have. And so forth.
<br>
<p>3) an easily understood set of rules for measuring such things as the
<br>
libertarianness and stability of a player society.
<br>
<p>So, for example, let's say you have a setup wherein there are hundreds of
<br>
societies, each of which occupies it's place on the map. Any new player is
<br>
randomly given membership of one. These societies are given incentives and
<br>
rewards within the game -- access to better technology, more useful items,
<br>
prestige, new quests, areas of the game etc -- the more libertarian they
<br>
are. As a quick guess, I'd say that perhaps there is a method for imposing
<br>
and removing rules on an area. Breaking the rules means that the game
<br>
imposes automatic penalties on your character...a libertarian society has
<br>
few rules, but a low incidence of problems. (Players vote on how much they
<br>
like their society and how many problems there are).
<br>
<p>And so forth. It would be interesting. Given the way in which very complex
<br>
societies evolve very quickly within existing MMORPGs, I'd like to see more
<br>
of what happens when societal development is more engineered (such as in a
<br>
Tale in The Desert, Jumpgate, etc).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And incidentally, this would help many people to develop better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political thinking.
</em><br>
<p>An admirable goal; but I think that the one that needs to be addressed first
<br>
is to assist people in developing a sense of responsibility and
<br>
accountability. Better societies flow from that.
<br>
