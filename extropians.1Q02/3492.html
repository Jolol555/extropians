&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you've finally hit on a formulation/wording for natural rights
<br>
that I can agree with, and would think you would find a much easier time
<br>
getting most people to agree to. I don't think it's possible to argue from
<br>
either absolutes or &quot;human nature&quot; (since people define that however fits
<br>
their agendas), but this wording makes the case very clear and very strong.
<br>
Except that I wouldn't say &quot;by virtue  of their specific nature&quot;, but
<br>
something along the lines of &quot;historically, to get the results we seem to
<br>
want (more prosperity, health, a better working society, more freedom)
<br>
humans seem to need these rights, protections, etc&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that making rights a legal creation (which I have to
<br>
admit to thinking that they are) makes their case much less strong, and
<br>
this might be the reason they're so often stated as inherent, but you
<br>
weaken the case for people who don't see them as anything more than
<br>
abstractions from evidence. (If that makes sense...) Your way achieves the
<br>
results much more cleanly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike.

Subject: Re: sentient rights (was RE: Battleground God)
<br>
<p>Agreed.  It is a strange turn of phrase.  To me the argument that natural
<br>
rights grow out of the fact that humans, by virtue  of their specific
<br>
nature, require certain conditions in order to  live and thrive most
<br>
optimally and a subset of those are  basically rights to their own person,
<br>
property and pursuits - the so-called &quot;negative rights&quot; - comes closest to
<br>
a justification for natural rights.
