<em>&gt; &gt; our galaxy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; helping out and uploading (or whatever is &quot;best&quot;) the species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it runs across.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly.  Absorbing foreign technologies and experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes for more survivable entities (look at mitochondria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and chloroplasts).  But it is questionable whether such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mergings would grant some subset of the mergents replication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights.  The Borg assimilate -- but they don't grant the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assimilated &quot;free will&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Firstly let me make clear I was talking about a non-sentient
<br>
nanoprobe that does only very basic stuff like upload whole
<br>
populations it encounters, and then let them figure things out
<br>
from there. Its purpose is not to absorb them or do anything
<br>
other than help them stop dying. I think this would be a very
<br>
popular thing to do in civilizations that are capable of launching
<br>
such a system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that for an ATC to produce an expansionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective it must give up a survival perspective.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it gives up a survival perspective (embracing an Extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolve as fast as you can perspective?) then they may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tip off the edge of the cliff as fast as they come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One has to create a balance between evolving and surviving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't yet currently see how individuals (or civilizations)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can make those choices in a non-destructive fashion (without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imposing some rather draconian solutions).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So if the only concern is that you are afraid the newly uploaded
<br>
species will turn around and eat the original advanced civilization
<br>
there are couple of things (at least) to bring up: 1) even without
<br>
the interference of the foreigh nanoprobe, those species should
<br>
eventually work their way up to a Singularity and come after you
<br>
anyway 2) therefore the safest thing to do, if you are truly
<br>
interested in both insuring your long term survival and also
<br>
stopping death throughout the Universe, might be to send out
<br>
your army of nanoprobes to upload everything it finds and /also/
<br>
implement a Sysop in their local solar system to help them out
<br>
yet also ride along with them wherever they go to make sure they
<br>
play well with others.
