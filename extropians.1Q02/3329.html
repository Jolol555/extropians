</em><br>
<p>All economic value is, at root, subjective.  How do you define &quot;money&quot;?
<br>
The most objective defintion I've seen of it is the most traded
<br>
commodity.  In, e.g., any modern economy, it's quite easy to see what
<br>
money is.  It arose spontaneously, but now government controls it.
<br>
Despite government control, money remains the most traded commodity --
<br>
roughly half of all transactions.  Since money should arise
<br>
spontaneously and be based on what people (through the market want),
<br>
even your idea for money would have to pass that test.  I.e., it would
<br>
need to be accepted by actual market participants -- enough so to push
<br>
out all rivals.  Failing this, it's a mere academic exercise.
<br>
<p>Not here, a [spontaneously] chosen currency need not be gold or
<br>
silver -- though through much of history these were the monies of
<br>
choice.  Even so, currencies other than gold and silver have arisen in
<br>
the past and even are used in some limited areas right now, such as
<br>
cigarettes in immediate postWar Germany and in prisons today.  In fact,
<br>
Kevin Dowd argues that [a return to] laissez faire banking now would
<br>
probably result in some sort of basket of commodities or an index
<br>
standard for money -- to make money as stable as possible.  See his
<br>
_Laissez-Faire Banking_ and [if you can find a cheap copy] _Competition
<br>
and Finance: A Reinterpretation of Financial and Monetary Economics_.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
