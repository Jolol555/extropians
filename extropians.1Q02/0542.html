<em>&gt; Ok, lets for the sake of the discussion assume every human

</em><br>
<em>&gt; treaty on human rights.  Lets assume one is also granted an equal

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Earth.  So every human in their current form can survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and live a happy life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>As others have mentioned, if these rights are &quot;fundamental&quot; aka 
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; then they are not ours to grant.  But let's say we 
<br>
acknowledge these rights.
<br>
<p>A share of raw energy and matter is pointless.  It would be more 
<br>
reasonable to say that say, housing, education, clothing, food 
<br>
and so on are givens as a citizen of the local sentient space 
<br>
(although some sentients may not require all of these things).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Problem #1: Each additional human born is going to be taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from your &quot;fair&quot; share.  Solutions: (a) accept the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until your resources are depleted to the point where you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no longer survive; (b) enact a ban on reproduction (which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect violates something in the U.N. treaty).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>It is exceedingly unlikely that enough humans could exist in the 
<br>
immediate area that the amount of energy/matter necessary to 
<br>
feed the MNT could not be procured.  I suggest we deal with that 
<br>
situation in the unlikely event we run into it.  There is no 
<br>
reason that humans would desire to breed indefinitely at a 
<br>
disasterous rate given that much opportunity to do other things 
<br>
and given a local universe to expand into.  So I think the 
<br>
problem is more than a little contrived and contrived toward a 
<br>
highly unlikely scenario.  No ban or starvation is necessary.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Problem #2: How do you allocate *future* resources that become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available?  If I invest my time, energy and capital and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go risk my neck to stake a claim on Ceres, making it my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal island in the solar system, and then reproduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is allowed to continue until humanity reaches the carrying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity of the solar system -- does &quot;humanity&quot; have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to take Ceres from me and reallocate it to the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who sat on their lazy butts watching TV for the next century?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It is your scenario that created the problem.  It is not mine. 
<br>
I simply posited that an ahundant society is more than capable 
<br>
of providing a reasonable standard of living for all of its 
<br>
citizens as a baseline.  What is possible and desirable and how 
<br>
it is organized beyond that baseline is a different question 
<br>
entirely that I did not address as it was not part of the 
<br>
initial subject or response.   I very seriously doubt in any 
<br>
case that humans much as we know them today are going to be 
<br>
around and inclined to make babies in the conventional way long 
<br>
enough to &quot;reach the carrying capacity of the solar system&quot;. 
<br>
The place of private property in future expansion into space is 
<br>
an interesting problem that has a great deal of complexity.  Any 
<br>
answer I gave right now would be pretty much irrelevant and 
<br>
debatable to no good end.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Its a fundamental question -- when do &quot;fundamental&quot; human rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trump property rights?  One almost has to laugh at Fukuyama arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for human &quot;dignity&quot; and preventing human cloning when 20 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people a year die of hunger and starvation.  Or probably more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who will die from HIV infections.  Lets address the *real* problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It is not one I plan to answer right now.  I am not at all sure 
<br>
what we will even consider &quot;property&quot; versus &quot;commons&quot; 20 years 
<br>
from now or for that matter in 5 years.  Some problems that 
<br>
could be cast as property rights problems might in fact be 
<br>
meaningless in such terms.  Now the deed to Ceres may or may not 
<br>
be available to any particular individual exclusively.
<br>
<p>But generally, human rights do not ever trump property rights to 
<br>
the extent that &quot;property&quot; is applicable in a particular 
<br>
situation and to the extent property rights derive from human 
<br>
rights.
<br>
<p>I agree on the importance of addressing real problems.  Whole 
<br>
heartedly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Precisely what does &quot;contributing&quot; mean?  In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;whose judgment and by what criteria is this to be evaluated? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is why I raised the point.  Evaluation of contributions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems likely to be quite subjective.  Of course one could &quot;vote&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on contributions -- everyone gets 5 votes to cast any way they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like (boy would we all become political then).  Or we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setup a system where the votes are weighted by perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributions -- i.e. your votes count for more if you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived by your peers as contributing more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>So great, some bubbleheaded sex god or goddess gets the majority 
<br>
of the votes and those smelly old brainiac nerds get almost none 
<br>
at all. :)  My point is that there can be no rational system of 
<br>
determining life or death based on &quot;contribution&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Can it be evaluated for instance by whether or not enough people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;care enough for something one has or has produced or does to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;offer to pay sufficiently for it for those payments to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;exchanged for the necessities and desires of the individual? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was thinking more along extropic lines -- one defines some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system of evaluating the degree to which one contributed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexification -- one could normalize say art and science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so even though they are working in quite different directions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent &quot;contributions&quot; were valued equally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>This obviously will not work. There is no objective way to judge 
<br>
these things.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What of those who are outside of the current envelope of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;people find valuable enough to pay for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One would have to have a scheme that valued novelty as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>If the scheme could capture the novelty then it would no longer 
<br>
be novelty.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;There are many intensely creative and brilliant souls out there who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cannot find anyone that will actually pay them for what they consider most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;important to do.  Should these be considered to be &quot;not contributing&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, now this is an interesting question.  One would suppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;humanity&quot; wants &quot;useful&quot; stuff -- i.e. stuff that serves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uplift humanity over time (increasing productivity, providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater entertainment, etc.).  But we know of artists that never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became &quot;great&quot; until well after they died.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>But we know this assumption is actually false in practice.  Most 
<br>
humans want stuff that will please their immediate appetites and 
<br>
give them some illusion of being more than they are to be 
<br>
perfectly frank about it.  In any case the majority are not fit 
<br>
judges of the truly new and cutting edge.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Being &quot;paid&quot; really isn't an issue -- everyone is in non-survival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mode.  If we assume everyone has uploaded, then what might happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you get allocated time slices in the computronium matrix in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relation to your &quot;perceived&quot; contribution.  No contribution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your &quot;mind&quot; only gets to run once in a blue moon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Now that would be incredibly stingy considering the unimaginably 
<br>
vast resources available in such a space.  Of course, if you are 
<br>
basically a couch-potato with no subjective lapse in 
<br>
consciousness watching the tube or whatever you probably 
<br>
wouldn't know the difference.  But why do this?  Run the potato 
<br>
at full speed and it might get over such a dull trip that much 
<br>
faster and do something far more interesting.  In any case, who 
<br>
will say what the contribution is or allocate timeslices?  What 
<br>
is this allocating time-slices anyway when an almost limited 
<br>
number of conscious  and not processes will be runnable in 
<br>
parallel?  Why should some of those have the right to determine 
<br>
that others run much slower?  This would be the computronium 
<br>
equivalent of imprisonment, of being shackled.  It would 
<br>
especially be unfair if one is actually in competition with 
<br>
other entities not so shackled.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Or is the society actually likely to be much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;richer when people have the &quot;luxury&quot; of picking what they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;most passionate at and pursuing that without their very survival

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Or* will society become stale and lethargic when people are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer motivated by the needs of survival?  (Remember -- you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the fundamental right to &quot;exist&quot; (as a human) -- whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have a fundamental right to an &quot;equal share&quot; of the expanded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources and technologies in the solar system is what I'm trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to address here.  (For example, I believe there is wording in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.N. treaties regarding &quot;space&quot; and &quot;international waters&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that every human is entitled to their &quot;fair share&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these resources -- no matter who develops them.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't know about you but I most definitely don't become 
<br>
lethargic at all when I don't have to &quot;make a living&quot;.  You are 
<br>
probably right about something I believe was called the &quot;Space 
<br>
Treaty&quot; that had all kinds of plain wrong-headed notions in it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand I suspect that most of the true wastrels 
<br>
will happily sell their rights to a piece of Europa or whatever 
<br>
to the highest bidder without blinking an eye. Human rights does 
<br>
not require equality of results.  As long as skills, interests, 
<br>
motivations and drive diverge, results will also diverge. I am 
<br>
in no wise advocating a homogenous society.  I am advocating one 
<br>
with a lot more options and freedom to chart one's own course 
<br>
than I believe is presently the case.  And I am advocating that 
<br>
no one starves or goes homeless or is cut off from the 
<br>
information net or anything else considered basic.  Beyond that 
<br>
it is in the hands of skill and chance what happens to any 
<br>
particular individual sentient.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;As as been mentioned on this list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;several times, that is only one of many ways a posthuman culture 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;might be organized and it is increasingly less likely, or at any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rate less necessary, as the society moves from  one of assumed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;scarcity to assumed abundance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.  Perhaps what I didn't make clear was my interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in addressing the end-point conditions, rather than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transition conditions.  The entire period of colonization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Americas was a transition period -- you discovered/claimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and developed physical resources as you were able.  Now that period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is largely ended.  One can view the world today as one where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the non-expanding physical resources must be allocated to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding number of people.  (I'm ignoring the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substitutions and technology development are currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masking the severity of the situation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>But I think you would agree that ignoring that makes a problem 
<br>
or at least more of a problem than actually is present. 
<br>
Especially at this time in history we are about to release the 
<br>
genie that can chase physical scarcity off this world for quite 
<br>
some time and allow us to transcend both this world and most 
<br>
likely our fleshy conditionings if not flesh itself.  So where 
<br>
exactly is the problem?  We are at the cusp of the greatest 
<br>
transitional period of all time.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, that is only apparent to those with a certain 
<br>
amount of technological sophistication.  And even for us, we 
<br>
can't eat or wear MNT produced goods just yet.  Right now there 
<br>
are many appearances of scarcity and drain.
<br>
<p>A dark thought I sometimes ponder is for how much longer we must 
<br>
depend on unfair levels of inequality and unfair (not just 
<br>
caused by merit or market) distributions of currently not 
<br>
unlimited wealth, in order to amass the time, knowledge and 
<br>
skills to overcome the limitations.  Looked at historically, it 
<br>
is obvious that concentrations of power and wealth have been 
<br>
essential to progress.  It is not at all clear when these 
<br>
concentrations become less relevant to progress or if they do. 
<br>
If these are indeed required then there will be in all 
<br>
likelihood episodes of defending these concentrations against 
<br>
those who have more or less justified gripes about having less. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you actually tell them that it is so they or their 
<br>
children will have many times more than you do today?  It is 
<br>
true imho but it smacks of pie in the sky and the old communist 
<br>
call for sacrifice for the sake of State and the future.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If it is a truly abundant society with few space/resource constraints I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;don't see that this is an issue as far as actualy physical drain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on the society goes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps some of the Europeans on the list might want to comment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the issue of the physical drain on society posed by &quot;deadwood&quot;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Now, at this snapshot in time, there is an apparent drain.  OK.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;One answer to this is to not have so much (if any) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;central authority.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but what happens if the entire 50 billion people on Earth vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take Ceres from me by &quot;eminent domain&quot;?  No central authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I still end up losing most likely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>How would they &quot;vote&quot; and have their vote enforced?  By whom? 
<br>
By a lot of individuals banding together to produce a space 
<br>
armada to come and take it by force?  Sure, that is possible. 
<br>
And it is possible that you could make it difficult enough to do 
<br>
so that they ultimately consider it not worth the cost.  That is 
<br>
what would occur in pure anarchy.  With a few more legal 
<br>
agreements in place you might have other recourse.  Yes, you 
<br>
still might lose.  So?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Another answer is some form of competency 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;testing on voters and perhaps weighing of votes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, well I see we may have reached similar conclusions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>&lt;g&gt; Yes.  And some things should be off-limits and not subject 
<br>
to a vote at all in a sane society (if such is possible).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Overall, I see no good reason why one's survival should be tied 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to &quot;contributing&quot; to society in an extropian worldview.  Such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;criteria of &quot;contributing&quot; smacks of one's worth depending on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;pleasing others.  It goes against the grain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that its unnecessary during the periods when we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be developing uses for very underutilized resources.  Its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a question primarily for periods when those resources are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially stretched -- like the Earth now (until we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expand the technology envelope) or the solar system in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few hundred to a few thousand years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
