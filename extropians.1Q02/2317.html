<p>Oh right  , now I see. Global warming theory is a conspiracy against

Libertarians. I think the jury's still out, and despite your protestations 
<br>
most climatologists do believe the earths avaerage temperature is rising and 
<br>
weather change is accelerating, yours is a minority view; but it must be 
<br>
lovely to be so certain about almost everything.

<em>&gt; &gt; Climatic scientists are pretty much agreed that we are undergoing massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; climate change all over the planet. The arguement seems to me to  be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about whether this is down to human activity or whether this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural pattern of activity of the worlds climatic systems. In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words - the world is getting warmer, but this is normal and we better get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, most emphatically NO, most scientists are not agreed, at least in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way you mean. In fact, the majority do not agree that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant anthropogenic warming trend. ALL scientists do agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;we are undergoing climate change&quot;, but that is a semantically neutral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement which only recognises that the world climate is not a stasis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a dynamic system with a myriad of inputs and outputs that change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over time. Saying that &quot;we are undergoing climate change&quot; is true even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if that climate change is that we are going into an ice age. Even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the world is getting cooler and part getting warmer, to sum out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to zero, this still means that &quot;we are undergoing climate change&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason why there is so much doubt about warming, and anthropogenic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warming in particular, is that the period of data collection is so very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short for those claiming that there is catastrophic change happening,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally only a 30-100 year period. Longer range studies, based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things like tree rings and ice cores, show that climatic change does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, in fact, happen, to the degree claimed by proponents of big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government taxes on energy and everything else, nor do ice ages start in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as little as a decade (or stop).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, the oceans rose approximately 400 feet over 1000 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the end of the last ice age, around 9000 BC, but it wasn't until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5600 BC that sea levels got high enough to breach the Bosporus and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dardanelles to flood the Black Sea basin, whose freshwater surface was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some 135 feet below sea level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The antarctic ice cap, for instance, has been completely stable, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing slowly over the long term, for the past 15 million years or so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever since Antarctica broke away from South America and the circum polar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ocean current became permanently established. This is a known fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cataclysmists have had to recently concede in the scientific world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the media has refused to acknowledge this major setback for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big-government/tax-everything-to-pay-for-climate-control agenda. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human race will never be flooded with 90 meters of seawater worldwide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an antarctic collapse. At worst, we may see a 3-9 meter change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sea level IF the Greenland Ice Cap collapses, however doing things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flooding the Caspian basin will mitigate this to a large degree, as will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the growth of the Antarctic Ice Cap created by increases in evaportion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the equator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The melting of the arctic ice sheet will not change ocean levels even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the climate changes, since the ice is already floating. What will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen is the increase in open ocean in the arctic will increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaporation and thus increase precipitation in Greenland, thus helping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mitigate any increase in melting that occurs in the margins.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to see is if the media hype engine will rev up as high

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for global cooling as it did for global warming.  Will it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; symmetrical?

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there be political movements urging us to hurl more greenhouse gases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the atmosphere to save our planet from the advancing ice?  Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there be international treaties to pressure nations into cutting down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some of their CO2 hogging lifeforms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine the horrors: Oceans could recede, vast stretches of frozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tundra could be covered in ice, beach resort towns could be left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hundreds of meters inland, causing the tourist industry to suffer.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in climate could burst forth over a mere few centuries!  How will we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever cope?  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Excellent! I can see a wonderful spoof TV documentary right now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously, even when there was a mini-panic about global cooling in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; early 1970s (remember &quot;The Weather Machine and the Threat of Ice&quot; ?) it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; never got the coverage of global warming. I think it's obvious why -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; global warming can be used to argue for lots of government controls and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; getting rid of technology but you can't do that with cooling, quite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; opposite in fact. In fact as people like Matt Ridley have pointed out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; global cooling is a much more credible threat than global warming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; given that the default setting for the planet's climate right now is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ice age. Also, all the evidence suggests that the end of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; interglacial and the onset of an ice age happens *very* quickly - less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; than ten years is the figure usually given. Steve Davies
