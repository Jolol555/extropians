<em>&gt;&gt; I'm not sure about the latter claim.  After all, if the cycler station was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more like a storage depot, each individual trip to it might use a lot less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fuel than a straight shot to Mars.  Why?  The mass would be smaller for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ship docking to the cycler station.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imaging a station that orbits in such a way that it goes near earth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mars.  (We'll call this the &quot;cycle orbit&quot;.)  Sending a ship to rendevous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the cycler station is EXACTLY the same as putting the shp in the &quot;cycle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit&quot;.  You have gained nothing (energy-wise) by having a station already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbiting at that same spot.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  Good old laws of physics... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The idea is, I think, to use the cycle more as a cheap way to ferry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and maybe people back and forth.  One can make several small trips to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cycler station -- rather than one big one to the station or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destination. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True.  But the energy cost per item remains the same.  You are just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dividing that energy cost among several trips.
</em><br>
<p>The total cost of all the trips might be the same or higher as one big trip, 
<br>
but the fact is we have small rockets right now and small payloads.  It's 
<br>
kind of like the poor man's choice of buying one serving of rice at a time 
<br>
instead of a months' supply... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A similar but different scenario is to use an asteroid.  Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;landing&quot; on the asteroid, you just get in the way and &quot;crash&quot; on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asteroid.  In this way, you don't have to expend the energy to match speeds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (You just have to have enough padding to survive the crash.)  This would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually change the asteroid's orbit after many crashes, but the time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do that might be years or centuries.
</em><br>
<p>An interesting idea.  We'd also have to know about the particular asteroid 
<br>
&nbsp;-- depending on the goals here.  After all, Eros appears to be covered with 
<br>
dust and small rocks.  Impacting it might result in a lot material being 
<br>
kicked up -- a hazard to many operations. 
<br>
<p>How could we find out what a particular asteroid is like before attempting 
<br>
such an impact?  Perhaps a smaller probing impact? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That could be a problem...  Is there only one cycler configuration?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My exmple time was a circular orbit.  I think (but haven't done the math)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that an eccentric orbit that touched both orbits would have a period 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to this average.
</em><br>
<p>The site Anders cited gave what appeared to be another configuration.  In 
<br>
fact, IIRC, the cycler proposed changed orbital configurations to suit 
<br>
travelers... 
<br>
<p>Cheers!
