<p><em>    &gt; Facts that really matter are: Those people feel their country, their

</em><br>
<p>That's true, they will never love us so it's pointless to try to be lovable to
<br>
them. And the only fact I want to convince them of is that if they try to kill me
<br>
they will wind up with a bullet in the brain. I also think it's worth saying that
<br>
we understand the Afghani people one hell of a lot better than they
<br>
understand us.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Fundamental mistake number 2 is to ignore the cultural background
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;of other  people. Peanut butter in food packets for example, with written
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; instructions in several western languages. (1) Afghans don't know peanut
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; butter
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, if I was starving I think I could figure out that I'm supposed to place the
<br>
substance in my hand, move it to my mouth, chew, and then swallow. I really think
<br>
I could reason this out all by myself even if I didn't have a schematic or written
<br>
instructions I could follow.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;nor is it a usefull food for starving people.
</em><br>
<p>20 tablespoons of peanut butter a day and nothing else provides more than
<br>
enough calories for a human being to survive, it also supplies enough protein,
<br>
fiber,  vitamin E, Niacin , Folate,  Vitamin B6 , Magnesium,  Phosphorus ,
<br>
Copper,  Potassium , Iron and Zinc. It would also give you about a third of
<br>
the needed vitamins B1, B2, D, and Calcium. I'd say that was useful.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;What seems to be difficult to communicate is that a long chain of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;unwise behaviour of the US (and other countries) in the past  has
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;led to the hate and the hostility of many people against the western
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;countries and especially the USA.
</em><br>
<p>Unwise? Probably false, certainly irrelevant. In a world with only one
<br>
superpower that superpower will be hated in certain quarters regardless
<br>
of its behavior, it's inevitable. However lots of people hate other people
<br>
but they don't go around killing them because they know their will be dire
<br>
consequences if they do, this war is about reminding Islamic fundamentalists
<br>
of that fact.
