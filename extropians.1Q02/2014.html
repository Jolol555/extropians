<p><p>There is more than just citrus fruit, and quite an array of tasty things
<br>
that do grow in the inland cold climates.  It is true that you'll probably
<br>
find much more variety in the hotter climes such as citrus (which is
<br>
certainly true in my experience), but there are a number of fruits that only
<br>
grow in the colder climates.  A lot of the cold weather fruit in the U.S. is
<br>
grown in the rain shadow of the Pacific Northwest, but much of it could
<br>
probably be grown anywhere.
<br>
<p>Fruit that grows well in cold climates: apples, pears, apricots, cherries,
<br>
grapes, raspberries, blueberries, and a bunch of other fruit that many
<br>
people aren't familiar with.  We had most of these growing in our yard when
<br>
I lived on the Washington/Idaho border.  Cherries, apples, pears, and
<br>
berries of all types really thrive in the northern cold weather climates and
<br>
most of the U.S. production happens there.  Cold weather grape varieties
<br>
also grow easily in the northern U.S. and eastern Washington was a major
<br>
production center for cold weather grape varietals (we had several different
<br>
kinds growing on our back fence).
<br>
<p>At the very least, you could definitely grow apples, pears, and cherries
<br>
just about anywhere in the snow belt, and they are good looking trees that
<br>
wouldn't detract from the landscaping.  And of course, there is the famous
<br>
spring blossoms that these trees produce as well.
