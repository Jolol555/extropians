<p>I think the entire paradigm flips.  If we can get an open source
<br>
group that designs a genome for a house that grows itself, it should
<br>
be feasible for individuals to survive based on the &quot;fruit of their
<br>
house&quot;.  It probably takes a couple of years to &quot;grow&quot; the house
<br>
but once you have broadband wired up to it, in theory you never
<br>
need to leave it.  (Much of the energy consumed on a per person
<br>
basis is consumed in moving that person from place to place.)
<br>
<p>Now, *if* we get the life extension technologies down to an affordable
<br>
level (I think this is doable but it remains to be proven) then
<br>
one needs do nothing but sell your labor (from whatever one is
<br>
good at) into the open market and bank it.  So everyone eventually
<br>
ends up rather wealthy.  At that point people like Anders and
<br>
Damien will have to pay me to take neuroscience and writing lessons
<br>
from the via telepresence.  Of course due to the excess solar insolation
<br>
in Australia vs. Sweeden, Damien will be able to afford more of my
<br>
studentship than Anders.
