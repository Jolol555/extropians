I consider this anti-body ideological syndrome something of a pathology
<br>
we should be on guard against in our own thinking. Sure, we want
<br>
*better* bodies, maybe even entirely virtual bodies one day. We want to
<br>
be able to think rationally and not be controlled by atavisms or
<br>
obsolete genetic programming. But at the same time we are seeking to
<br>
extend the truly human aspects of ourselves: our ability to choose our
<br>
own path, our ability to be truly individual - both alone and in groups,
<br>
we want to extend and enhance our aesthetics, emotions and ambitions. We
<br>
will always have flaws and limits, but we will strive to overcome them
<br>
rather than yearn for some unachievable perfect state. We seek to become
<br>
*more*, not less.

<p>Anders, I found your words very insightful.  I recently met a highschool age young man in Extropy chat who was an ardent Singulitarian.  I realize he is young and still developing his mind and views, but still I found some of his comments very disturbing.  He greeted me initially by saying &quot;how was your meaty day?&quot;  And continued throughout the conversation on how he truly despised his &quot;meat body&quot; and wanted desperately to be uploaded to finally be free of it.  The severity of his obsession made me wonder if this could negatively affect his body image.
<br>
<p>This fellow wanted to put aside many human activities(like dating, etc.) to totally focus his life on helping to bring about the Singularity.  I appreciate his good intentions and fervor, but it did make me wonder whether he will have regrets down the road.  
<br>
<p>I realize he is young, and both during and after college may very much change from what he is now.  But I do see a real possible dark side to the transhumanist obsession with uploading and moving away from the &quot;pathetic and inferior body.&quot;  Have there ever been anorexics who just really hated their meatsicle bodies??
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
