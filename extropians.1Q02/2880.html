</em><br>
<em>&gt; children and spouses, business associates, creditors, neighbors, etc..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Drug addicts do damage in pursuit of the next high mainly because

</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost+reasonable profit, they could sustain their habit by occasionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cutting a lawn (and they would, I am sure). 
</em><br>
<p>Yet why is it that both alcohol and gambling are legal activities for
<br>
adults in most jurisdictions in the US, yet many perfectly normal adults
<br>
completely ruin their lives, and the lives of others (spouse/children
<br>
going homeless/malnourished, drunk driving homicides and injuries, etc)?
<br>
If the criminality of the substance were the only factor as you claim,
<br>
then alcholics and gambling addicts should have no negative impact on
<br>
society. The fact they do have one disproves the criminality theory.
<br>
<p>### You have a good point here - however, I was mostly concerned with the
<br>
criminal aspects of drug addiction - the fact that addicts tend to have the
<br>
combination of poor ability to earn money, and a large appetite for cash
<br>
(secondary to high drug prices). This results in a fair amount of theft,
<br>
robbery, and other damaging activities, which are effectively the result of
<br>
voters' good intentions expressed as stupid laws, and could be effectively
<br>
eliminated by giving registered addicts access to drugs at low cost, as in
<br>
methadone programs. I guess I should have been more specific about my
<br>
meaning here.
<br>
<p>As you rightly note, there are two other types of damage inflicted on third
<br>
parties by addicts - the damage done as direct result of impaired cognition
<br>
while under the influence (as in DUI, or drunk wife beating), and the damage
<br>
secondary to neglect of their usual social responsibilities. Again, my
<br>
statement did not directly deny this (I wrote about damage *mainly* and not
<br>
exclusively because of drug prices), although I should have mentioned that
<br>
at cost drug access programs would not mitigate these types of damage.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I fully agree with Amara -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the state should not regulate drug intake by adults, except if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely unavoidable to limit access to drugs by adolescents, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are at the highest risk for becoming addicted.
</em><br>
<p>While I agree that the state should not regulate intake by adults (a
<br>
point which I have NEVER disputed, by the way), this does not mean that
<br>
addicts should not be held accountable for their actions just as
<br>
children and criminals are. Users should be required by their insurance
<br>
carriers (even in a libertarian setting) to adequately insure against
<br>
the externalities of their potential bad behavior while impaired and/or
<br>
addicted. If they do take care of this risk, then they can toke up with
<br>
my blessing.
<br>
<p>### I fully agree with you here. I think your and Amara's views are not so
<br>
dissimilar when look at the details.
