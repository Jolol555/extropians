Those of you in the LA area might be interested in the following talk:
<br>
<p><p>CS Seminar:
<br>
Tuesday, JAN 8th
<br>
4:00 - 5:00pm
<br>
Baxter Lecture Hall
<br>
Reception at 3:45pm
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorphous Computing
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Jay Sussman
<br>
<p><p>Digital computers have always been constructed to behave as precise
<br>
arrangements of reliable parts, and our techniques for organizing
<br>
computations depend upon this precision and reliability.  Two emerging
<br>
technologies, however, are begnning to undercut these assumptions
<br>
about constructing and programming computers.  These technologies --
<br>
microfabrication and bioengineering -- will make it possible to
<br>
assemble systems composed of myriad information-processing units at
<br>
almost no cost, provided: 1) that not all the units need to work
<br>
correctly; and 2) that there is no need to manufacture precise
<br>
geometrical arrangements or interconnection patterns among them.
<br>
<p>Microelectronic mechanical components are becoming so inexpensive to
<br>
manufacture that we can anticipate combining logic circuits,
<br>
microsensors, actuators, and communications devices integrated on the
<br>
same chip to produce particles that could be mixed with bulk
<br>
materials, such as paints, gels, and concrete.  Imagine coating
<br>
bridges or buildings with smart paint that can sense and report on
<br>
traffic and wind loads and monitor structural integrity of the bridge.
<br>
A smart paint coating on a wall could sense vibrations, monitor the
<br>
premises for intruders, or cancel noise.  Even more striking, there
<br>
has been such astounding progress in understanding the biochemical
<br>
mechanisms in individual cells, that it appears we'll be able to
<br>
harness these mechanisms to construct digital-logic circuits.  Imagine
<br>
a discipline of cellular engineering that could tailor-make biological
<br>
cells that function as sensors and actuators, as programmable delivery
<br>
vehicles for pharmaceuticals, as chemical factories for the assembly
<br>
of nanoscale structures.  Fabricating such systems seem to be within
<br>
our reach, even if it is not yet within our grasp
<br>
<p>Fabrication, however, is only part of the story.  We can envision
<br>
producing vast quantities of individual computing elements, whether
<br>
microfabricated particles, engineered cells, or macromolecular
<br>
computing agents constructed by engineered cells, but we have few
<br>
ideas for programming them effectively:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can one engineer prespecified, coherent behavior
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the cooperation of immense numbers of unreliable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parts that are interconnected in unknown, irregular,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and time-varying ways?
<br>
<p>This is the challenge of Amorphous Computing.
