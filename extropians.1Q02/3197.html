<em>&gt; &gt; The only real big savings

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, it's all a matter of whether you can afford the investment
<br>
required to produce and put into the cycler orbit the infrastructure to
<br>
truly make it an energy and mass saving venture. You gotta spend money
<br>
to make it.
<br>
<p>At this point, you run into the welfare pols who think that 'the money
<br>
is better spent here on earth' (as if the money is actually spent in
<br>
space based malls or something) on 'human needs'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recently, there's been talk about using Alpha (AKA the ISS) as a place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to assemble prepackaged space probes and the like.  The idea is to not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to cram everything into the cone of a Delta/Ariane/Proton and hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can survive launch vibrations and unfurl itself before going on its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merry way.  On Alpha, instead, different parts can be ferried up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cushioned packages, then assembled and tested in orbit.  If something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should fail, repairs or substitutes might be arranged.  In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't have to lose the whole probe because a solar panel didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfurl.  I imagine a cycler can be used for that too -- as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unattended spacecraft going between destinations.  Of course, this adds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the costs of having and maintaining a living crew en route.
</em><br>
<p>I was thinking of packaging pieces in a cushioning/bracing material
<br>
which could be easily converted into fuel for spacecraft once in orbit.
<br>
I hear that there is a form of a plasma engine that uses teflon or
<br>
styrofoam for fuel, so maybe this isn't such a kooky idea.
<br>
<p>Having Alpha station up there and fully functional certainly is a very
<br>
valuable asset for use as a staging base for assembly of bigger and more
<br>
complex interplanetary missions.
<br>
<p>Having the ability to disassemble packed pods in orbit opens up the
<br>
possibility of using the packaging concept to allow launch of equipment
<br>
from less expensive, higher G launch mechanisms, like guns and rail
<br>
launchers.
