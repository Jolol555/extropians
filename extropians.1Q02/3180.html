<p>I doubt it. The test has a few arbitrary points. I took zero hits but bit
<br>
two bullets (or the test did fail in two minor points, regarding on your
<br>
viewpoint).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My problem was that I seem to require more proof that God exists than I need

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. Claim of a superbeing is a much taller order than an apersonal
<br>
optimization principle (and well validated at that -- not possible to map
<br>
to boolean domain as required by test). Hence considerably more and more
<br>
stringent proofs are required (not absolute, absolute doesn't exist).
<br>
<p>The site:
<br>
<p>Bitten Bullet 1
<br>
<p>You answered &quot;True&quot; to questions 6 and 13.
<br>
<p>These answers generated the following response:
<br>
<p>You stated earlier that evolutionary theory is essentially true. However,
<br>
you have now claimed that it is foolish to believe in God without certain,
<br>
irrevocable proof that she exists. The problem is that there is no certain
<br>
proof that evolutionary theory is true - even though there is overwhelming
<br>
evidence that it is true. So it seems that you require certain,
<br>
irrevocable proof for God's existence, but accept evolutionary theory
<br>
without certain proof. So you've got a choice: (a) Bite a bullet and claim
<br>
that a higher standard of proof is required for belief in God than for
<br>
belief in evolution. (b) Take a hit, conceding that there is a
<br>
contradiction in your responses.
<br>
<p>You chose to bite the bullet.
<br>
<p>This is wrong. (a) is a perfectly valid response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        I does point out that my belief that evolutionary theory is based to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree on 'faith' in the absence of irrefutable proof. This is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can honestly say I have not thought about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Perhaps my reasoning is that any opposing views to evolution are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurd that they don't deserve consideration.
</em><br>
<p>I bit my second bullet here on the question of square circles. The claim
<br>
is equally highly dubious here, because spacetime geometry could very well
<br>
lead to different values of pi and polygonal circles, without being
<br>
inconsistent (i.e. other universes could have different laws of physics,
<br>
and hence reasoning based on local laws does not have necessary meaning
<br>
there). God deserving the name would be able to modify universes, and
<br>
assign arbitrary values to interpretation of different situations.
<br>
<p>You answered &quot;True&quot; to Question 16.
<br>
<p>This answer generated the following response:
<br>
<p>You've just bitten a bullet! In saying that God has the freedom and power
<br>
to do that which is logically impossible (like creating square circles),
<br>
you are saying that any discussion of God and ultimate reality cannot be
<br>
constrained by basic principles of rationality. This would seem to make
<br>
rational discourse about God impossible. If rational discourse about God
<br>
is impossible, there is nothing rational we can say about God and nothing
<br>
rational we can say to support our belief or disbelief in God. To reject
<br>
rational constraints on religious discourse in this fashion requires
<br>
accepting that religious convictions, including your religious
<br>
convictions, are beyond any debate or rational discussion. This is to bite
<br>
a bullet.
