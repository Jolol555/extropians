<p>I did not know that, but come to think of it, it does make sense.
<br>
Let's consider ourselves a little transcriptor machine, looking to read
<br>
some DNA and make RNA from it.  Here's some.  Now, which strand is which?
<br>
And which way is &quot;forward&quot;?  The DNA extends for thousands of miles in
<br>
each direction on our scale.  It's twisted around itself so there is no
<br>
way to distinguish one strand from a passive mirror.  And one direction
<br>
looks like the other.  So there is no reason we can't read genes in
<br>
either direction, and on either strand.
<br>
<p>The only reason I could see for evolution to prefer using a single
<br>
strand and a single direction were if that created a more compact and/or
<br>
efficient way of packing all the genes into the DNA.  The real mystery
<br>
to me is why efficiency is seemingly not a factor and why junk DNA is
<br>
allowed to proliferate.  But given that efficiency is not an issue,
<br>
then in hindsight it is predictable that both directions and strands
<br>
could be used.
