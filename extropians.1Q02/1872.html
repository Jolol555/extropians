</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't know how relevant it is or isn't but a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gen-X and later kids grew up with less contact with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parental units and more time in front of the tube and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer screens from real early.  Parents do not copy their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents when the economic conditions change so that both work
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; own. Also the cultural and technological environment has changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather quickly which makes child-rearing even more unlikely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be just like mum and dad did it.
</em><br>
<p><p>Absolutely, but the time during which people began to refer to autism as the
<br>
latest 'epidemic' was the late fifties, shortly before the family with both
<br>
people working became the norm. Also, within a community, people tend to
<br>
gravitate towards a 'norm' of childrearing ideas, so childminder's ideas and
<br>
values are likely to be similar to mum and dad's...the 'financial sexual
<br>
revolution' may on the one hand have placed children in the care of people
<br>
who actually like children, on the other hand, 'childminder' may also be
<br>
doing just a job for money, but...parents are bound to go with the
<br>
childminder who gets the best report / results / opinion from their kids. So
<br>
&nbsp;I believe the former to be the case, and a good thing too...but to get to
<br>
the point, if autism *is* a mutation, then it will show up in the genome as
<br>
opposed to the phenome...and what I am asking is, has anyone any evidence to
<br>
the contrary?
