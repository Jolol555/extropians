Extropes,
<br>
<p>Might I ask to those proposing wild-ass schemes, to please spend
<br>
some time doing some background reading about the objects for which
<br>
you are embedding in your engineering feat ? Not spending time
<br>
on those basic pieces (including doing your own math) makes the
<br>
whole shebang look like hand-waving silliness. Probably I'm being
<br>
grumpy, but alot of this black hole stuff can be found in basic
<br>
introductory astronomy texts.
<br>

<p>I have no idea if &quot;nano-sized black holes&quot; scale like star-sized or

galactic-sized black holes (I'm not a black hole expert). The

proposing it should have a  physically plausible description.
<br>
<p>To power the energy output of a quasar (10^{47} erg/sec), assuming

an efficiency mass conversion via a swirling accretion disk of 10%,

would require swallowing more than 10 M_solar per year.
<br>
<p>It's useful to examine the density of the object becoming a black hole.
<br>
For a pre-collapse state (using Euclidean geometry), the mean density of
<br>
the pre-black-hole object of mass M is: ~ ( 3 c^6 ) / (32 pi G^3 M^2).
<br>
[assumine a volume of a sphere, with R equal to the Schwarzschild radius

2GM/c^2]
<br>
<p>Looking at stellar-sized (1 M_solar object) black hole and
<br>
galactic-sized 10^9 M_solar object black holes:
<br>
<p>for a 1 M_solar object, the density is ~10^{16} gr/cm^3 (greater than
<br>
the density of a typical neutron star).
<br>
<p>for a 10^(9) M_solar object, the density is ~10^{-2} gr/cm^3 (like

the density of a gas)

<p>MSW's Gravitation might be the best place to start for 'harnessing a
<br>
cosmic generator'. They have a scenario of an advanced civilization
<br>
which has constructed an enclosed bubble five million miles in
<br>
diameter around a 10 M_Sun black hole and rotating in a
<br>
counterclockwise direction at about .94c. A space capsule hauling a
<br>
garbage barge is launched at 2/3 c, fast enough to allow a close
<br>
approach and escape. Whipped into an inward-spiraling orbit, the
<br>
vehicle enters the ergosphere in the black hole's equatorial plane,
<br>
where the ergosphere (region where frame-dragging can no longer
<br>
resist) is widest. At a given point, the capsule ejects the garbage
<br>
barge backward with with enormous force. The barge spirals down into
<br>
the  black hole while the capsule picks up rotational energy and
<br>
flies back out to the bubble's inner surface, where it strikes a
<br>
flywheeel that powers an electrical generator.

<p><em>&gt;Would feeding the nanohole with dust at all make sense?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't read the beginning and intermediate posts regarding this
<br>
problem, Eugene, so I don't know the conditions. I would guess that
<br>
the lifetime of the dust particle would not be very long though,
<br>
because you're immersing the dust in a high-energy shocked plasma
<br>
(i.e. the accretion disk around the black hole)
<br>
<p>The below text is for a hot plasma from supernova remnants,
<br>
which is not as hot as an accretion disk, but the same arguments
<br>
should apply regarding short lifetimes.
<br>
<p>======================
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Dwek, E. chapter &quot;Infrared Emission From Dust In Supernovae and
</em><br>
Supernova  Remnants&quot;, IAU Symposium  135: Interstellar Dust, Kluwer,
<br>
1989
<br>
<p>\subsection{Dust Temperature in a Hot Gas}
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
So far, I have assumed that the dust temperature can be
<br>
characterized by its equilibrium value, obtained by balancing the
<br>
dust heating rate by particle collisions to its cooling rate by IR
<br>
emission. However, below a given grain size, (approximately 200
<br>
angstrom in most remnants), the  temperature of a dust particle will
<br>
fluctuate with time. This effect is a natural consequence of the
<br>
heat capacity and cross section of these small dust particles:
<br>
individual electron hits raise the grain temperature well above its
<br>
equilibrium value, and the grain cooling time at these temperatures
<br>
is significantly faster than the time between electronic collisions.
<br>
<p>\subsection{Evidence for Very Small Dust Particles in a Shocked Gas}
<br>
<p>The results described above suggest that in young supernova remnants
<br>
such as Cas A, Tycho, and Kepler, characterized by gas temperatures
<br>
in excess of 2~x~10^7 K, the infrared spectrum should be well
<br>
described by a single-temperature dust model. Yet, the observed IR
<br>
spectra of these remnants (Braun, 1987; Dwek \etal, 1987) show a
<br>
significant excess of 12micron  emission above that expected from
<br>
dust particles radiating at the equilibrium temperature.  Simply
<br>
extending the grain size distribution to very small particles (a ~3
<br>
Angstroms) will not cause a broadening in the infrared spectrum,
<br>
since the equilibrium dust temperature is essentially constant with
<br>
grain size. The 12micron  flux from these remnants can only be
<br>
explained if the temperature of these dust particles fluctuates,
<br>
reaching values of ~300 K for brief intervals of time. The observed
<br>
12micron  excess in these remnants therefore provides solid proof
<br>
for the existence of dust particles with sizes between ~10--200
<br>
angstroms in the remnant, and for the stochastic nature of their
<br>
heating mechanism. Furthermore, the lifetime of these remnants is
<br>
short ( &lt;400 yrs), so these very small particles could not have been
<br>
created by the destruction of larger (a ~250 angstrom) particles in
<br>
the shocked gas (see below). This suggests that the  grain size
<br>
distribution in the pre-shocked gas must have contained the very
<br>
small dust particles needed to explain the excess 12micron  emission
<br>
in the spectrum of these remnants.
<br>
<p>\subsection{Evidence for Grain Destruction}
<br>
<p>In a hot gas, dust particles are destroyed by sputtering on a
<br>
timescale given by t(yr) ~10^6 a(micron)/n, where n is the gas
<br>
density in cm^{-3}  and a is the radius in microns (Draine and
<br>
Salpeter, 1979; Seab, 1987). The lifetime of a 0.1micron  dust
<br>
particle embedded in a 10 cm^{-3} gas is ~10^4 yrs, longer than the
<br>
shock crossing time of all bright x-ray remnants observed with the
<br>
IRAS. It should therefore not be surprising to find dust particles
<br>
in supernova remnants, a fact clearly demonstrated by the IRAS
<br>
observations. Sputtering, will, however, reduce the relative number
<br>
of small dust particles in the size distribution. This effect will
<br>
suppress the short wavelength infrared emission from the dusty
<br>
plasma.
<br>
<p>To demonstrate that dust destruction is taking place in the remnant,
<br>
one must assume knowledge of the initial grain size distribution.
<br>
[...] The amount of sputtering needed to improve the fit to the
<br>
observed fluxes determines the residence time of the dust in the hot
<br>
gas, or the time since the gas was swept up by the expanding SN
<br>
blast wave. For region C in Puppis A, ADP found that the grain
<br>
residence time in the shocked gas is 300 +- 150 yrs.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;From C. F. McKee chapter &quot;Dust Destruction in the Interstellar
</em><br>
Medium&quot;, IAU Symposium  135: Interstellar Dust, Kluwer, 1989
<br>
<p>\begin{abstract}
<br>
Grains are injected into the interstellar medium (ISM) from evolved
<br>
stars and supernovae; in addition, supernova ejecta may condense
<br>
onto pre--existing grains before becoming well--mixed with the
<br>
interstellar gas. Once in the ISM, grains can grow by accretion, but
<br>
are also subject to destruction by interstellar shocks.  The current
<br>
status of the theory of shock destruction of interstellar grains is
<br>
reviewed briefly.  Small grains are destroyed by thermal sputtering
<br>
in fast, nonradiative shocks; large grains are destroyed by
<br>
grain--grain collisions and eroded by nonthermal sputtering in
<br>
radiative shocks.  The dominant shocks in the ISM are from supernova
<br>
remnants (SNRs), and the mass of grains destroyed is proportional to
<br>
the energy of the SNR. In a multiphase ISM, these shocks destroy the
<br>
grains at a rate proportional to the volume filling factor of the
<br>
phase; since the density of the hot phase is too low for efficient
<br>
grain destruction, most of the destruction occurs in the warm phase.
<br>
Not all SNRs are effective at destroying grains, however:  some are
<br>
above the gas disk, and some ---Type II's in associations---are
<br>
highly correlated in space and time. The galactic SN rate is
<br>
observed to about 2.2 per century (van den Bergh, 1983), but the
<br>
{\it effective supernova rate} for grain destruction is estimated to
<br>
be only about 0.8 per century.  As a result, the timescale for the
<br>
destruction of a typical refractory grain in the ISM is inferred to
<br>
be about 4x10^8 yr for either a two--phase or a three--phase
<br>
ISM. Most of the refractory material in the ISM (other than carbon)
<br>
is injected by supernovae, not evolved stars; the net injection
<br>
timescale is estimated as about 1.5x10^9 yr. Comparison of
<br>
the destruction and injection timescales indicates that the fraction
<br>
of grains injected by stars which survive in the ISM is only about
<br>
20%. Most of the refractory material in interstellar grains must,
<br>
therefore, have accreted onto the grains in the ISM. Nonetheless, a
<br>
significant fraction of dust formed in stars survives in the ISM and
<br>
may be detectable in meteorites and interplanetary dust particles.
