</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Better yet make it a multiplayer game, replacing much of the simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions by decisions actually made by the human players in the given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context, and making the experience much more convincing. Any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggestion ?
</em><br>
<p>It should be easy to modify an existing game, and get an educational 
<br>
licence. Problem would be that the (govt owned) educational market for such 
<br>
a game would probably like to see whatever it is they are teaching, proven 
<br>
by such a simulation. Rather than a model that may prove the oposite. For a 
<br>
commercial market, the game should be fun, and to most kids fun means 
<br>
explosions or car races, so finding funding for such a project won't be easy.
<br>
<p>In most &quot;god-sim&quot; strategy games with an economical aspect, the laissez 
<br>
faire principle generally works best, (which generally isn't much more than 
<br>
having low taxes). Most of those games however also show the kids playing 
<br>
them, that going to war with one of the other players can be very 
<br>
profitable...
<br>
<p>If you're serious about making such a game, i'd advise you to check out 
<br>
&quot;Simcity 3000&quot;, as well as an older game called &quot;Shadow President&quot;. They're 
<br>
both games that have a little bit more than the average simplified &quot;tax&quot; 
<br>
model (on the city social/economic level and on global foreign policy 
<br>
respectively), they're both games that though being more complex than the 
<br>
standard game in their genre,  succeeded in keeping the &quot;fun&quot; appeal of a 
<br>
&quot;game&quot;.
