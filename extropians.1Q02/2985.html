From: &quot;Brian Phillips&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:deepbluehalo@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20AGING:%20perhaps%20we%20are%20over%20the%20hump">deepbluehalo@earthlink.net</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;   The core funds should (IMHO) be placed in Swiss anuities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as this is a (effectively) a legal way to save funds and acrue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest on them, and not tell Uncle Sam about them without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaking the US tax code.
</em><br>
<p>Better be careful how you do this. The Swiss banking industry is now
<br>
co-operating with Uncle S more than they did in the past. I've read articles
<br>
about this and observed it personally.
<br>
<p>See, for example,
<br>
<p><a href="http://globalarchive.ft.com/globalarchive/article.html?id=011116000639">http://globalarchive.ft.com/globalarchive/article.html?id=011116000639</a>

<p>excerpt:
<br>
<p>===================
<br>
The reasons for Switzerland's growing openness are not hard to find. At a
<br>
political level, pressure for increased transparency in financial services
<br>
is growing apace. The EU countries are concerned that their citizens are
<br>
using Swiss bank accounts to evade taxes, whilst the US has made it very
<br>
clear, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, that it expects
<br>
unfettered co-operation from foreign governments in tracking down terrorist
<br>
money flows.
<br>
<p>Switzerland has no choice but to co-operate. It has put in place
<br>
know-your-customer rules and anti-money laundering legislation which are
<br>
amongst the best in the world. Nevertheless, most foreign governments still
<br>
cannot understand the Swiss distinction between tax fraud and tax evasion.
<br>
Switzerland will waive its bank secrecy rules for the former, but not the
<br>
latter. Sooner or later, most suspect this will have to change.
