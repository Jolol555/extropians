<p>
<em>&gt; I disagree with you.  It is inappropriate for all occasions.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least in English, there's no idea or concept that requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profanity to be expressed unambiguously.  There's always a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or collection of words that can be used instead of the profanity.
</em><br>
<p>Now, that's just not true at all.  The expressive content of
<br>
a statement is not just (or even mainly) the predicates expressed
<br>
by the meanings of the words; a sentence also communicates how
<br>
the speaker feels about the subject, and sometimes that even
<br>
helps clarify what he's trying to say.
<br>
<p>I have a lot of respect for those who like to think and reason
<br>
and speak clearly.  But expressing how you feel doesn't hurt,
<br>
and it can help.  I, for example, use profanity rarely (perhaps
<br>
about one message out of 50 or so--I'd have to check an
<br>
archive to be sure, so when I do I hope it has some effect.
<br>
If I used it all the time no one would notice. But the last
<br>
time I did (I think it was &quot;fuck the will of the people&quot;) it
<br>
expressed my opinion of public consensus as clearly and directly
<br>
as if I had said &quot;I don't particularly value the will of the
<br>
people in that context&quot;, but it also makes it clear that I think
<br>
that's an important point, and that I actually have some
<br>
/negative/ feelings about public consensus.
