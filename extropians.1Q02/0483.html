<p><em>    &gt;The threat from Gamma Ray Bursts is much greater than
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;NEOs or nuclear war (astro-ph/0110162). Fortunately it looks
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;like we may be safe from them through the next century or so
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;(unless there is an O or B class star nearby we are unaware of).
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>How about a simple virus mutation? Something as deadly as Ebola
<br>
and as contagious as the common cold might spread so fast that
<br>
scientists would have no time to study it. Compared with other
<br>
mammals there is remarkably little genetic variation in the Human
<br>
Race so it is at least conceivable that one very bad bug could
<br>
cause an extinction, sort of like a Dutch Elm Disease for people.
<br>
I'm not expecting it to happen but it's something to think about.
