I had said:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The exowomb article had a pointer at the end to this article:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Discovery of 'Methuselah gene' unlocks secret of long life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,644020,00.html">http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,644020,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Article seems unimaginative. Drugs, hell.  Wouldn't the &quot;zinc 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finger&quot; stuff for turning on/off genes work with this?
</em><br>
<p>Yes Samantha of course.  But we are *way* out in front of the
<br>
pack in our awareness at that level.  I was simply using the
<br>
Decode efforts to strengthen the Perls results (in Science one
<br>
wants replication of results).
<br>
<p>In the final analysis the devil will be in the details.
<br>
If its as simple as a gene that promotes maintenance and
<br>
repair in younger individuals that gets turned off at
<br>
puberty, then it may be relatively easy to reverse the
<br>
gene state in adults.  If its something much more complex
<br>
than that, it may be a lot more difficult than designing a
<br>
new zinc finger protein to change the state of that gene's
<br>
expression level.
<br>
<p>We must sit on the edge of our chairs and watch the parade go by.
<br>
