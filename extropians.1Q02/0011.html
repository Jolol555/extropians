<em>&gt; currently surrounds cryonics, and I don't like to complain about something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I don't have any solutions, but the lack of scientific credibility of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of people will fall back on the idea that &quot;any chance is better than

<em>&gt; no chance;&quot; I agree that such is true...but when that &quot;any chance&quot; is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The key is at best going to be an information-theoretic one, combined with
<br>
a slightly more detailed payoff matrix than heretofore.
<br>
<p>Ralph Merkel has lain the groundwork for this. (Laid?)
<br>
<p>I think it's a good idea for someone to take up writing this
<br>
and making it a part of the (copyleft?) literature. I would make
<br>
a distinction between cold storage and cryonic suspension as practiced
<br>
today, while acknowledging that there is still a technology gap even
<br>
with an excellent suspension done with the best techniques available.
<br>
<p>More in sorrow than in anger sort of approach: in effect, at 
<br>
dry ice temperatures your loved one will get freezer burn that
<br>
is much harder to repair, and the outlook is even worse for
<br>
a loved one left at room temperature for 72 hours.
