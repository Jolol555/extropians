<em>&gt; The issue is that many current transhumanists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in a generation that is now taking hold and dealing with wold issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from academics.  In the real world we need to consider what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression to make, and how! to make it.  Rather than fighting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream and critizing the currents, take action and participate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it is formed.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly! It is important to remember that we will never get anywhere if we
<br>
sit in our secret cellar club of Initiated and think we must fight the
<br>
mainstream - while we can really get things done by *becoming* the
<br>
mainstream. The mistake many people make is to think that this is impossible
<br>
without losing their autheticity and ideals, so they get a convenient excuse
<br>
to never start changing the world (because somehow their own purity is more
<br>
valuable). But participating in shaping the new mainstream almost requires us
<br>
to know who we are and what we want - otherwise we just become drifting
<br>
cynical pragmatics with no driving force and hence no edge in the shaping of
<br>
culture. 
<br>
<p>The world is filled with opportunities for us right now. The launch window is
<br>
open!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In fact, we are very careful of not mentioning the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;transhumanist&quot; in the debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let?s discuss this Anders.  I agree that it is probably not a good idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discuss transhumanist in a debate regarding politics, unless you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing the future of humanity, topic of human potential, social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures, etc.  If you are discussing the social fabric of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who make up any one ideological agenda, it might also be worthwhile to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention, who are part of the business world and scientific/technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development, it might also be a good idea to discuss the people market. 
</em><br>
<p>If asked, I never never deny that I consider myself a transhumanist and
<br>
usually explain what I mean by that. But I have found that the mere mention
<br>
of an &quot;ism&quot; tends to put people off. It sounds too much like a cult, religion
<br>
or a political ideology - and members of such groups are (at least here in
<br>
Sweden) considered embarrasing or dangerous. Saying &quot;I believe in humans, in
<br>
their ability to be rational, free and strive towards excellence&quot; is
<br>
generally well accepted, but even claiming to be a humanist makes people
<br>
suspicious. 
<br>
<p>Even when debating the future of humanity it is not obvious what we can gain
<br>
from introducing the term transhumanism right now. We can certainly argue for
<br>
what we believe in (and it is extremely well received in the right groups -
<br>
there is a real thirst for visions among many politicians, businesspeople and
<br>
intellectuals), but the time might not yet be ripe to bring it all under a
<br>
banner of &quot;transhumanism&quot; (or any other term) if there is not yet a coherent
<br>
movement ready for primetime. As long as we have debates as the current one,
<br>
where even the definition of the fundamentals is in the air, then it would be
<br>
hard to gain anything from mixing in the &quot;trademark&quot; of transhumanism into
<br>
the debate without being able to back it up with strong ideological
<br>
arguments. That doesn't mean ExI, WTA and ProAct can't play an important and
<br>
open role, but they will likely do better if they present their ideas on
<br>
their own merit than if they do it as linked to transhumanism. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I?d like to know what advantages you find in the European Liberal political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agenda.  Could you please expand on what basic principles stand out as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aligned with a futurist agenda, especially ones which encourages and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protects individual advancement? 
</em><br>
<p>I think this is mostly a matter of misunderstanding. I consider myself
<br>
libertarian (my current reading is _The Machinery of Freedom_ by David
<br>
Friedman, but I think I'm a minarchist, not an anarcho-capitalist :-), but
<br>
since this term is generally called liberal here in Sweden, I tend to point
<br>
out the difference, which may cause extra confusion. I'm definitely not the
<br>
US kind of liberal, which here in Sweden would be a rightist social democrat 
<br>
(although I do have many social democrat friends, some of which regard
<br>
themselves as transhumanists).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is not up to any one organization to do the work for us.  Why rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ExI? It?s certainly the best thing we have available for us today and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopefully tomorrow, but it is an organization comprised of people.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people make the organization work or not work. 
</em><br>
<p>This is true, but there is also an effect of the organization on people.
<br>
Certain styles of organization or organization cultures attract different
<br>
people, and this will in turn shape the organization and its work. In the end
<br>
it is always up to the individuals, but if organizations can be created
<br>
suitable for certain aims more high quality individuals can be stimulated to
<br>
work together.
