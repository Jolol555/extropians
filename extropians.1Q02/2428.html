re:'For a given caloric intake you can achieve a specific mass, no more'
<br>
<p>Some people will be more muscular than others at a given caloric intake
<br>
depending on several factors including but not limited to:
<br>
Type and frequency of exercise, and efficiency of recovery (repair) from.
<br>
Macronutrient ratios (protein fat carb ratios, and what type,
<br>
bio-availability etc.)
<br>
Micronutrient factors (given caloric intake of potato chips and beer vs.
<br>
lean meat and fresh veggies)
<br>
Sleep/rest factors (stress hormones have an effect, as you 'grow' at rest,
<br>
not in the Gym)
<br>
Genetic factors (der...)
<br>
Endocrine state (hypothalamic sensitivity to LH, estrogen, GHRH etc, free to
<br>
bound testosterone etc.)
<br>
<p>And so.. you can be more muscular or less for a given caloric intake, you
<br>
can look Brad Pit in fight club, or Bruce Lee enter the dragon 'ripped'.
<br>
<p>I would chose to cut carbohydrate as the primary macronutrient (Protein
<br>
35%,  Omega 3 rich. Carbohydrates (also 35%) only vegetables and fruit, no
<br>
beans, bread, potatoes, or any grain. Then dietary and supplemental forms of
<br>
fat should provide 20-30% of (daily) calories.
<br>
<p>I would chose high bio-available proteins
<br>
I would avoid excessive aerobic activities
<br>
I would lift weights as a body builder (because I am)
<br>
I would supplement with Bulgarian Tribulus terrestris and Avena sativa, and
<br>
GH releasers

:
<br>
: &gt;Is it at all possible? Do people on CR necessarily have to get
<br>
: &gt;SOOO skinny?
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt;With CR, I understand, the body becomes more efficient in the way
<br>
: &gt;it uses the calories it receives. If this is correct, then the
<br>
: &gt;following might make sense to you.
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt;If I was to lower my present daily caloric intake (estimated at
<br>
: &gt;2,200-2,400) to CR-level (i.e.~1,800) I would, of course, lose
<br>
: &gt;weight. Given that my body-fat levels are low, that would also
<br>
: &gt;mean losing muscle mass (not quite a plus, as far as Im
<br>
: &gt;concerned!)
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt;At some point, however, the above-mentioned better efficiency
<br>
: &gt;should kick-in, right? Doesnt that improved efficiency mean that
<br>
: &gt;I could then be able to maintain a pre-CR bodyweight (or similar)
<br>
: &gt;while staying on 1,800 calories/day?
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt;or am I just trying to have it both ways?
<br>
:
<br>
: You're trying to have it both ways.
<br>
:
<br>
: For a given caloric intake you can achieve a specific mass, no
<br>
: more.
<br>
:
<br>
: By the way muscle is the first thing to go when you adopt CR, (or
<br>
: diet) which is why I never have.
