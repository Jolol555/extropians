Why the Muslims Misjudged Us
<br>
By Victor David Hanson

<br>
Since September 11, we have heard mostly slander and lies about the 
<br>
West from radical Islamic fundamentalists in their defense of the 
<br>
terrorists. But the Middle Eastern mainstreamîdiplomats, intellectuals, 
<br>
and journalistsîhas also bombarded the American public with an array 
<br>
of unflattering images and texts, suggesting that the extremistsô anti-
<br>
Americanism may not be an eccentricity of the ignorant but rather a 
<br>
representative slice of the views of millions. For example, Egyptian 
<br>
Nobel Prizeìwinning novelist Naguib Mahfouz reportedly announced 
<br>
from his Cairo home that Americaôs bombing of the Taliban was újust as 
<br>
despicable a crimeù as the September 11 attacksîas if the terroristsô 
<br>
unprovoked mass murder of civilians were the moral equivalent of 
<br>
selected air strikes against enemy soldiers in wartime. Americans, 
<br>
reluctant to answer back their Middle Eastern critics for fear of charges 
<br>
of úIslamophobiaù or úArab smearing,ù have let such accusations go 
<br>
largely unchecked. 
<br>
Two striking themesîone overt, one impliedîcharacterize most Arab 
<br>
invective: first, there is some sort of equivalenceîpolitical, cultural, and 
<br>
militaryîbetween the West and the Muslim world; and second, America 
<br>
has been exceptionally unkind toward the Middle East. Both premises 
<br>
are false and reveal that the temple of anti-Americanism is supported by 
<br>
pillars of utter ignorance. 
<br>
Few in the Middle East have a clue about the nature, origins, or history 
<br>
of democracy, a word that, along with its family (úconstitution,ù 
<br>
úfreedom,ù and úcitizenù), has no history in the Arab vocabulary, or 
<br>
indeed any philological pedigree in any language other than Greek and 
<br>
Latin and their modern European offspring. Consensual government is 
<br>
not the norm of human politics but a rare and precious idea, not 
<br>
imposed or bequeathed but usually purchased with the blood of heroes 
<br>
and patriots, whether in classical Athens, revolutionary America, or 
<br>
more recently in Eastern Europe. Democracyôs lifeblood is secularism 
<br>
and religious tolerance, coupled with free speech and economic liberty. 
<br>
Afghan tribal councils, without written constitutions, are better than 
<br>
tyranny, surely; but they do not make consensual government. Nor do 
<br>
the Palestinian parliament and advisory bodies in Kuwait. None of these 
<br>
faux assemblies is elected by an unbound citizenry, free to criticize 
<br>
(much less recall, impeach, or depose) their heads of state by legal 
<br>
means, or even to speak openly to journalists about the failings of their 
<br>
own government. Plato remarked of such superficial government-by-
<br>
deliberation that even thieves divvy up the loot by give-and-take, 
<br>
suggesting that the human tendency to parley is natural but is not the 
<br>
same as the formal machinery of democratic government. 
<br>
Our own cultural elites, either out of timidity or sometimes ignorance of 
<br>
the uniqueness of our own political institutions, seldom make such 
<br>
distinctions. But the differences are critical, because they lie unnoticed 
<br>
at the heart of the crisis in the Muslim world, and they explain our own 
<br>
tenuous relations with the regimes in the Gulf and the Middle East. 
<br>
Israel does not really know to what degree the Palestinian authorities 
<br>
have a real constituency, because the people of the West Bank 
<br>
themselves do not know eitherîinasmuch as they cannot debate one 
<br>
another on domestic television or campaign on the streets for alternate 
<br>
policies. Mr. Arafat assumed power by Western fiat; when he finally was 
<br>
allowed to hold real and periodic elections in his homeland, he simply 
<br>
perpetuated autocracyîas corrupt as it is brutal. 
<br>
By the same token, we are surprised at the duplicity of the Gulf States 
<br>
in defusing internal dissent by redirecting it against Americans, 
<br>
forgetting that such is the way of all dictators, who, should they lose 
<br>
office, do not face the golden years of Jimmy Carterôs busy house-
<br>
building or Bill Clintonôs self-absorbed angst. Either they dodge the 
<br>
mobôs bullets or scurry to a fortified compound on the French coast a 
<br>
day ahead of the posse. The royal family of Saudi Arabia cannot act out 
<br>
of principle because no principle other than force put and keeps them in 
<br>
power. All the official jets, snazzy embassies, and expensive press 
<br>
agents cannot hide that these illegitimate rulers are not in the political 
<br>
sense Western at all. 
<br>
How sad that intellectuals of the Arab worldîthemselves only given 
<br>
freedom when they emigrate to the United States or Europeîprofess 
<br>
support for democratic reform from Berkeley or Cambridge but secretly 
<br>
fear that, back home, truly free elections would usher in folk like the 
<br>
Iranian imams, who, in the manner of the Nazis in 1933, would 
<br>
thereupon destroy the very machinery that elected them. The fact is that 
<br>
democracy does not spring fully formed from the head of Zeus but 
<br>
rather is an epiphenomenonîthe formal icing on a preexisting cake of 
<br>
egalitarianism, economic opportunity, religious tolerance, and constant 
<br>
self-criticism. The former cannot appear in the Muslim world until gallant 
<br>
men and women insist upon the latterîand therein demolish the 
<br>
antidemocratic and medieval forces of tribalism, authoritarian 
<br>
traditionalism, and Islamic fundamentalism. 
<br>
How much easier for non-voters of the Arab world to vent frustration at 
<br>
the West, as if, in some Machiavellian plot, a democratic America, 
<br>
Israel, and Europe have conspired to prevent Muslims from adopting 
<br>
the Western invention of democracy! Democracy is hardly a Western 
<br>
secret to be closely guarded and kept from the mujaheddin. Islam is 
<br>
welcome to it, with the blessing and subsidy of the West. Yes, we must 
<br>
promote democracy abroad in the Muslim world; but only they, not we, 
<br>
can ensure its success. 
<br>
The catastrophe of the Muslim world is also explicable in its failure to 
<br>
grasp the nature of Western success, which springs neither from luck 
<br>
nor resources, genes nor geography. Like third-world Marxists of the 
<br>
1960s, who put blame for their own self-inflicted misery upon 
<br>
corporations, colonialism, and racismîanything other than the absence 
<br>
of real markets and a free societyîthe Islamic intelligentsia recognizes 
<br>
the Muslim worldôs inferiority vis-`a-vis the West, but it then seeks to 
<br>
fault others for its own self-created fiasco. Government spokesmen in 
<br>
the Middle East should ignore the nonsense of the cultural relativists 
<br>
and discredited Marxists and have the courage to say that they are poor 
<br>
because their populations are nearly half illiterate, that their 
<br>
governments are not free, that their economies are not open, and that 
<br>
their fundamentalists impede scientific inquiry, unpopular expression, 
<br>
and cultural exchange. 
<br>
Tragically, the immediate prospects for improvement are dismal, 
<br>
inasmuch as the war against terrorism has further isolated the Middle 
<br>
East. Travel, foreign education, and academic exchangesîthe only 
<br>
sources of future hope for the Arab worldîhave screeched to a halt. All 
<br>
the conferences in Cairo about Western bias and media distortion 
<br>
cannot hide this self-inflicted catastropheîand the growing ostracism 
<br>
and suspicion of Middle Easterners in the West. 
<br>
But blaming the West, and Israel, for the unendurable reality is easier 
<br>
for millions of Muslims than admitting the truth. Billions of barrels of oil, 
<br>
large populations, the Suez Canal, the fertility of the Nile, Tigris, and 
<br>
Euphrates valleys, invaluable geopolitical locations, and a host of other 
<br>
natural advantages that helped create wealthy civilizations in the past 
<br>
now yield an excess of misery, rather than the riches of resource-poor 
<br>
Hong Kong or Switzerland. How could it be otherwise, when it takes 
<br>
bribes and decades to obtain a building permit in Cairo; when habeas 
<br>
corpus is a cruel joke in Baghdad; and when Saudi Arabia turns out 
<br>
more graduates in Islamic studies than in medicine or engineering? 
<br>
To tackle illiteracy, gratuitous state-sanctioned killing, and the 
<br>
economic sclerosis that comes from corruption and state control would 
<br>
require the courage and self-examination of Eastern Europe, Russia, 
<br>
South America, even of China. Instead, wedded to the old bromides that 
<br>
the West causes their misery, that fundamentalist Islam and crackpot 
<br>
mullahs have had no role in their disasters, that the subjugation of 
<br>
women is a údifferentù rather than a foul (and economically foolish) 
<br>
custom, Muslim intellectuals have railed these past few months about 
<br>
the creation of Israel half a century ago, and they have sat either silent 
<br>
or amused while the mob in their streets chants in praise of a mass 
<br>
murderer. Meanwhile millions of Muslims tragically stay sick and hungry 
<br>
in silence. 
<br>
Has the Muslim world gone mad in its threats and ultimatums? 
<br>
Throughout this war, Muslims have saturated us with overt and with 
<br>
insidious warnings. If America retaliated to the mass murder of its 
<br>
citizens, the Arab world would turn on us; if we bombed during 
<br>
Ramadan, we would incur lasting hatred; if we continued in our mission 
<br>
to avenge our dead, not an American would be safe in the Middle East. 
<br>
More disturbing even than the screaming street demonstrations have 
<br>
been the polite admonitions of corrupt grandees like Crown Prince 
<br>
Abdallah of Saudi Arabia or editor Abdul Rahman al Rashed of Saudi 
<br>
Arabiaôs state-owned Al Sharq al Awsat. Donôt they see the impotence 
<br>
and absurdity of their veiled threats, backed neither by military force nor 
<br>
cultural dynamism? Donôt they realize that nothing is more fatal to the 
<br>
security of a state than the divide between what it threatens and what it 
<br>
can deliver? 
<br>
There is an abyss between such rhetoric and the world we actually live 
<br>
in, an abyss called power. Out of politeness, we neednôt crow over the 
<br>
relative military capability of 1 billion Muslims and 300 million 
<br>
Americans; but we should remember that the lethal, 2,500-year 
<br>
Western way of war is the reflection of very different ideas about 
<br>
personal freedom, civic militarism, individuality on the battlefield, 
<br>
military technology, logistics, decisive battle, group discipline, civilian 
<br>
audit, and the dissemination and proliferation of knowledge. 
<br>
Values and traditionsînot guns, germs, and steelîexplain why a tiny 
<br>
Greece of 50,000 square miles crushed a Persia 20 times larger; why 
<br>
Rome, not Carthage, created world government; why CortÈs was in 
<br>
Tenochtitl`an, and Montezuma not in Barcelona; why gunpowder in its 
<br>
home in China was a pastime for the elite while, when stolen and 
<br>
brought to Europe, it became a deadly and ever evolving weapon of the 
<br>
masses. Even at the nadir of Western power in the medieval ages, a 
<br>
Europe divided by religion and fragmented into feudal states could still 
<br>
send thousands of thugs into the Holy Land, while a supposedly 
<br>
ascendant Islam had neither the ships nor the skill nor the logistics to 
<br>
wage jihad in Scotland or Brittany. Much is made of 500 years of 
<br>
Ottoman dominance over a feuding Orthodox, Christian, and Protestant 
<br>
West; but the sultans were powerful largely to the degree that they 
<br>
crafted alliances with a distrustful France and the warring Italian city-
<br>
states, copied the Arsenal at Venice, turned out replicas of Italian and 
<br>
German canon, and moved their capital to European Constantinople. 
<br>
Moreover, their údominanceù amounted only to a rough naval parity with 
<br>
the West on the old Roman Mediterranean; they never came close to 
<br>
the conquest of the heart of Western Europe. 
<br>
Europeans, not Ottomans, colonized central and southern Africa, Asia 
<br>
and the Pacific, and the Americasîand not merely because of their 
<br>
Atlantic ports or ocean ships but rather because of their long-standing 
<br>
attitudes and traditions about scientific inquiry, secular thought, free 
<br>
markets, and individual ingenuity and spontaneity. To be sure, military 
<br>
power is not a referendum on moralityîPizarroôs record in Peru makes 
<br>
as grim reading as the Germansô in central Africa; it is, rather, a 
<br>
reflection of the amoral dynamism that fuels ships and soldiers. 
<br>
We are militarily strong, and the Arab world abjectly weak, not because 
<br>
of greater courage, superior numbers, higher IQs, more ores, or better 
<br>
weather, but because of our culture. When it comes to war, 1 billion 
<br>
people and the worldôs oil are not nearly as valuable military assets as 
<br>
MIT, West Point, the U.S. House of Representatives, C-Span, Bill 
<br>
OôRiley, and the G.I. Bill. Between Xerxes on his peacock throne 
<br>
overlooking Salamis and Saddam on his balcony reviewing his troops, 
<br>
between the Greeks arguing and debating before they rowed out with 
<br>
Themistocles and the Americans haranguing one another on the eve of 
<br>
the Gulf War, lies a 2,500-year cultural tradition that explains why the 
<br>
rest of the world copies its weapons, uniforms, and military organization 
<br>
from us, not vice versa. 
<br>
Many Middle Easterners have performed a great media charade 
<br>
throughout this war. They publish newspapers and televise the news, 
<br>
and thereby give the appearance of being modern and Western. But 
<br>
their reporters and anchormen are by no means journalists by Western 
<br>
standards of free and truthful inquiry. Whereas CNN makes a point of 
<br>
talking to the victims of collateral damage in Kabul, al-Jazeera would 
<br>
never interview the mothers of Israeli teenagers blown apart by 
<br>
Palestinian bombs. Nor does any Egyptian or Syrian television station 
<br>
welcome freewheeling debates or Meet the Pressìstyle talk shows 
<br>
permitting criticism of the government or the national religion. Instead, 
<br>
they quibble over their own degrees of anti-Americanism and obfuscate 
<br>
the internal contradictions of Islam. The chief dailies in Algiers, 
<br>
Teheran, and Kuwait City look like Pravda of old. The entire Islamic 
<br>
media is a simulacrum of the West, lacking the life-giving spirit of 
<br>
debate and self-criticism. 
<br>
As a result, when Americans see a cavalcade of talking Middle Eastern 
<br>
heads nod and blurt out the party lineîthat Israel is evil, that the 
<br>
United States is naÔve and misled, that Muslims are victims, that the 
<br>
West may soon have to reckon with Islamic angerîthey assume the 
<br>
talk is orchestrated and therefore worth listening to only for what it 
<br>
teaches about how authoritarian governments can coerce and corrupt 
<br>
journalists and intellectuals. 
<br>
A novelist who writes whatever he pleases anywhere in the Muslim 
<br>
world is more likely to receive a fatwa and a mob at his courtyard than a 
<br>
prize for literary courage, as Naguib Mahfouz and Salman Rushdie 
<br>
have learned. No wonder a code of silence pervades the Islamic world. 
<br>
No wonder, too, that Islam is far more ignorant of us than we of it. And 
<br>
no wonder that the Muslims havenôt a clue that, while their current furor 
<br>
is scripted, whipped up, and mercurial, ours is far deeper and more 
<br>
lasting. 
<br>
Every Western intellectual knows Edward Saidôs much-hyped theory of 
<br>
úOrientalism,ù a purely mythical construct of how Western bias has 
<br>
misunderstood and distorted the Eastern úOther.ù In truth, the real 
<br>
problem is úWesternismùîthe fatally erroneous idea in the Middle East 
<br>
that its propaganda-spewing Potemkin television stations give it a 
<br>
genuine understanding of the nature of America, an understanding 
<br>
Middle Easterners believe is deepened by the presence in their midst of 
<br>
a few McDonaldôs franchises and hired U.S. public-relations firms. That 
<br>
errorîwhich mistakes ignorance for insightîhelps explain why Usama 
<br>
bin Ladin so grossly miscalculated the devastating magnitude of our 
<br>
response to September 11. In reality, the most parochial American 
<br>
knows more about the repressive nature of the Gulf States than the 
<br>
most sophisticated and well-traveled sheikh understands about the 
<br>
cultural underpinnings of this country, including the freedom of speech 
<br>
and inquiry that is missing in the Islamic press. 
<br>
Millions in the Middle East are obsessed with Israel, whether they live 
<br>
in sight of Tel Aviv or thousands of miles away. Their fury doesnôt spring 
<br>
solely from genuine dismay over the hundreds of Muslims Israel has 
<br>
killed on the West Bank; after all, Saddam Hussein butchered hundreds 
<br>
of thousands of Shiites, Kurds, and Iranians, while few in Cairo or 
<br>
Damascus said a word. Syriaôs Assad liquidated perhaps 20,000 in 
<br>
sight of Israel, without a single demonstration in any Arab capital. The 
<br>
murder of some 100,000 Muslims in Algeria and 40,000 in Chechnya in 
<br>
the last decade provoked few intellectuals in the Middle East to call for 
<br>
a pan-Islamic protest. Clearly, the anger derives not from the tragic tally 
<br>
of the fallen but from Islamic rage that Israelis have defeated Muslims 
<br>
on the battlefield repeatedly, decisively, at will, and without modesty. 
<br>
If Israel were not so successful, free, and haughtyîif it were 
<br>
beleaguered and tottering on the verge of ruinîperhaps it would be 
<br>
tolerated. But in a sea of totalitarianism and government-induced 
<br>
poverty, a relatively successful economy and a stable culture arising 
<br>
out of scrub and desert clearly irks its less successful neighbors. Envy, 
<br>
as the historian Thucydides reminds us, is a powerful emotion and has 
<br>
caused not a few wars. 
<br>
If Israel did not exist, the Arab world, in its current fit of denial, would 
<br>
have to invent something like it to vent its frustrations. That is not to say 
<br>
there may not be legitimate concerns in the struggle over Palestine, but 
<br>
merely that for millions of Muslims the fight over such small real estate 
<br>
stems from a deep psychological wound. It isnôt about lebensraum or 
<br>
some actual physical threat. Israel is a constant reminder that it is a 
<br>
nationôs cultureînot its geography or size or magnitude of its oil 
<br>
reservesîthat determines its wealth or freedom. For the Middle East to 
<br>
make peace with Israel would be to declare war on itself, to admit that 
<br>
that its own fundamental way of doing businessînot the Jewsîmakes 
<br>
it poor, sick, and weak. 
<br>
Throughout the Muslim world, myth and ignorance surround U.S. 
<br>
foreign policy toward the Middle East. Yes, we give Israel aid, but less 
<br>
than the combined billions that go to the Palestinians and to Egypt, 
<br>
Jordan, and other Muslim countries. And it is one thing to subsidize a 
<br>
democratic and constitutional (if cantankerous) ally but quite another to 
<br>
pay for slander from theocratic or autocratic enemies. Though Israel 
<br>
has its fair share of fundamentalists and fanatics, the country is not the 
<br>
creation of clerics or strongmen but of European ÈmigrÈs, who 
<br>
committed Israel from the start to democracy, free speech, and 
<br>
abundant self-critique. 
<br>
Far from egging on Israel, the United States actually restrains the 
<br>
Israeli military, whose organization and discipline, along with the 
<br>
sophisticated Israeli arms industry, make it quite capable of annihilating 
<br>
nearly all its bellicose neighbors without American aid. Should the 
<br>
United States withdraw from active participation in the Middle East and 
<br>
let the contestants settle their differences on the battlefield, Israel, not 
<br>
the Arab world, would win. The military record of four previous conflicts 
<br>
does not lie. Arafat should remember who saved him in Lebanon; it was 
<br>
no power in the Middle East that brokered his exodus and parted the 
<br>
waves of Israeli planes and tanks for his safe passage to the desert. 
<br>
The Muslim world suffers from political amnesia, we now have learned, 
<br>
and so has forgotten not only Arafatôs resurrection but also American 
<br>
help to beleaguered Afghanis, terrified Kuwaitis, helpless Kurds and 
<br>
Shiites, starving Somalis, and defenseless Bosniansîdirect 
<br>
intervention that has cost the United States much more treasure and 
<br>
lives than mere economic aid for Israel ever did. They forget; but we 
<br>
remember the Palestinians cheering in Nablus hours after thousands of 
<br>
our innocents were incinerated in New York, the hagiographic posters 
<br>
of a mass murderer in the streets of Muslim capitals, and the smug 
<br>
remonstrations of Saudi prince Alwaleed to Mayor Giuliani at Ground 
<br>
Zero. 
<br>
Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti Westernized elites find psychological 
<br>
comfort in their peopleôs anti-American rhetoric, not out of real 
<br>
grievance but perhaps as reassurance that their own appetite for all 
<br>
things Western doesnôt constitute rejection of their medieval religion or 
<br>
their thirteenth-century caliphate. Their apologists in the United States 
<br>
dissemble when they argue that these Gulf sheikhs are forced to master 
<br>
a doublespeak for foreign consumption, or that they are better than the 
<br>
frightening alternative, or that they are victims of unfair American anger 
<br>
that is ignorant of Wahhabi custom. In their present relationship with 
<br>
the terrorists, these old-fashioned autocrats are neutrals only in the 
<br>
sense that they now play the cagier role of Francoôs Spain to Hitlerôs 
<br>
Germany. They aid and abet our enemies, but never overtly. If the 
<br>
United States prevails, the Saudis can proclaim that they were always 
<br>
with us; should we lose a shooting war with the terrorists, the princes 
<br>
can swear that their prior neutrality really constituted allegiance to 
<br>
radical Islam all along. 
<br>
In matters of East-West relations, immigration has always been a one-
<br>
way phenomenon. Thousands flocked to Athens and Rome; few left for 
<br>
Parthia or Numidia unless to colonize or exploit. People sneak into 
<br>
South, not North, Koreaîin the same manner that few from Hong Kong 
<br>
once braved gunfire to reach Peking (unless to invest and profit). Few 
<br>
Israeli laborers are going to the West Bank to seek construction jobs. In 
<br>
this vein is the Muslim worldôs longing for the very soil of America. Even 
<br>
in the crucible of war, we have discovered that our worst critics love us 
<br>
in the concrete as much as they hate us in the abstract. 
<br>
For all the frothing, it seems that millions of our purported enemies wish 
<br>
to visit, study, or (better yet) live in the United Statesîand this is true 
<br>
not just of Westernized professors or globe-trotting tycoons but of 
<br>
hijackers, terrorists, the children of the Taliban, the offspring of Iranian 
<br>
mullahs, and the spoiled teenage brats of our Gulf critics. The terrorists 
<br>
visited lap dancers, took out frequent-flier miles, spent hours on the 
<br>
Internet, had cell phones strapped to their hips, and hobnobbed in Las 
<br>
Vegasîparasitic on a culture not their own, fascinated with toys they 
<br>
could not make, and always ashamed that their lusts grew more than 
<br>
they could be satisfied. Until September 11, their ilk had been like fleas 
<br>
on a lazy, plump dog, gnashing their tiny proboscises to gain bloody 
<br>
nourishment or inflict small welts on a distracted host who found them 
<br>
not worth the scratch. 
<br>
This dual loathing and attraction for things Western is characteristic of 
<br>
the highest echelon of the terrorists themselves, often Western-
<br>
educated, English-speaking, and hardly poor. Emblematic is the evil 
<br>
genius of al-Qaida, the sinister Dr. al-Zawahiri: he grew up in Cairo 
<br>
affluence, his family enmeshed in all the Westernized institutions of 
<br>
Egypt. 
<br>
Americans find this Middle Eastern cultural schizophrenia maddening, 
<br>
especially in its inability to fathom that all the things that Muslim visitors 
<br>
profess to hateîequality of the sexes, cultural freedom, religious 
<br>
tolerance, egalitarianism, free speech, and secular rationalismîare 
<br>
precisely what give us the material things that they want in the first 
<br>
place. CDs and sexy bare midriffs are the fruits of a society that values 
<br>
freedom, unchecked inquiry, and individual expression more than the 
<br>
dictates of state or church; wild freedom and wild materialism are part of 
<br>
the American character. So bewildered Americans now ask themselves: 
<br>
Why do so many of these anti-Americans, who profess hatred of the 
<br>
West and reverence for the purity of an energized Islam or a fiery 
<br>
Palestine, enroll in Chico State or UCLA instead of madrassas in 
<br>
Pakistan or military academies in Iraq? 
<br>
The embarrassing answer would explain nearly everything, from bin 
<br>
Ladin to the intifada. Dads and moms who watch al-Jazeera and scream 
<br>
in the street at the Great Satan really would prefer that their children 
<br>
have dollars, an annual CAT scan, a good lawyer, air conditioning, and 
<br>
Levis in American hell than be without toilet paper, suffer from intestinal 
<br>
parasites, deal with the secret police, and squint with uncorrected vision 
<br>
in the Islamic paradise of Cairo, Teheran, and Gaza. Such a 
<br>
fundamental and intolerable paradox in the very core of a manôs 
<br>
heartîmultiplied millions of times overîis not a healthy thing either for 
<br>
them or for us, as we have learned since September 11. 
<br>
Most Americans recognize and honor the past achievements of Islamic 
<br>
civilization and the contribution of Middle-Eastern immigrants to the 
<br>
United States and Europe, as well as the traditional hospitality shown 
<br>
visitors to the Muslim world. And so we have long shown patience with 
<br>
those who hate us, and more curiosity than real anger. 
<br>
But that was then, and this is now. A two-kiloton explosion that 
<br>
incinerated thousands of our citizensîplanned by Middle Easterners 
<br>
with the indirect financial support of purportedly allied governments, the 
<br>
applause of millions, and the snickering and smiles of millions 
<br>
moreîhas had an effect that grows not wanes. 
<br>
So a neighborly bit of advice for our Islamic friends and their 
<br>
spokesmen abroad: topple your pillars of ignorance and the edifice of 
<br>
your anti-Americanism. Try to seek difficult answers from within to even 
<br>
more difficult questions without. Do not blame others for problems that 
<br>
are largely self-created or seek solutions over here when your answers 
<br>
are mostly at home. Please, think hard about what you are saying and 
<br>
writing about the deaths of thousands of Americans and your 
<br>
relationship with the United States. America has been a friend more 
<br>
often than not to you. But now you are on the verge of turning its 
<br>
peopleîwho create, not follow, governmentîinto an enemy: a very 
<br>
angry and powerful enemy that may be yours for a long, long time to 
<br>
come.
