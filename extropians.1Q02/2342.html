<p>The greenhouse effect is real.  (See Venus, or basic planetary science

calculations about the temperature of the Earth.)
<br>
CO2 is a greenhouse gas.
<br>
We're pumping CO2, and other greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere.
<br>
Especially in the case of coal, the CO2 was sequestered hundreds of
<br>
millions of years ago when (1) the sun was dimmer than today and (2) the
<br>
Earth was warmer than today.
<br>
<p>What's the basis for a default presumption that the Earth wouldn't be
<br>
getting warmer?
<br>
<p>Someone else asked why we would want to keep the climate at a set point
<br>
even if we weren't responsible for changing it.  Well, I like the fact
<br>
that a good winter will kill a lot of insects and parasites.  Winter has
<br>
been called one of the larger contributions to northern public health.
<br>
I don't want to go home to Chicago some day and get malaria.
<br>
<p>And with the 70 degree Decembers Chicago and Minneapolis have been
<br>
having for the past few years, that might not be so unlikely.  The cold
<br>
weather still breaks in by January, but the trend is rather alarming.
<br>
<p>For a less alarmist view, there's all this coastal property to be
<br>
flooded...
