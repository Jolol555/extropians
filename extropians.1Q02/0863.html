Commenting on my post suggesting that extropians not distinguish between
<br>
passive and active death inducing causes, <a href="mailto:CurtAdams@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Premature%20deaths%20[was:%20extropians-digest%20V7%20#4]">CurtAdams@aol.com</a> wrote:

<p><em>&gt; No, there's an important distinction - you can fix problems due

</em><br>
<p>Hardly.  Think of the resistance people have to wearing seat belts
<br>
or ceasing smoking.  It is very difficult to eliminate accidental
<br>
(or &quot;natural&quot;) deaths without changing the environment so it is inherently
<br>
safer (or changing individual lifestyles).  You have to force people to
<br>
pay for and adapt to those changes.  Think of a baby-gate to protect a
<br>
child from going someplace unsafe.  The adults have to change their
<br>
behavior to deal with the increased safety.  In some cases people
<br>
accept this, in many cases the scream quite loudly about the
<br>
increased hassles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Active deathists must be stopped.  They're a much more serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem as you have fewer options.
</em><br>
<p>Lets see.  The number of deaths due to heart disease in the U.S.
<br>
are ~700,000 annually.  The number of deaths due to terrorism
<br>
last year ~3000.  The Y2000 the NIH budget: $17.8 billion;
<br>
the DoD budget: $281 billion,
<br>
<p>So we have a more than &gt; 200:1 ratio in deaths and a 1:15 ratio
<br>
in funding to combat such deaths.  Now of course this isn't
<br>
really correct since we have no way of knowing the number of
<br>
deaths if our defense spending weren't so high but at the
<br>
same time only a sub-fraction of the NIH budget is allocated
<br>
to deal with heart disease (perhaps something like 15-20%).
<br>
<p>I suspect one could get better figures by taking countries that
<br>
do have terrorist problems, e.g. Spain or England, figure out the
<br>
percentage of GDP they dedicate to defense, scale that up
<br>
to the U.S. GDP and determine how much we are spending on
<br>
defense over what other countries spend (if any).
<br>
<p>If we are overspending on defense, then one could argue that
<br>
our marginal dollars would be better served by being dedicated
<br>
to the battle of the passive deaths of &quot;heart disease&quot; rather
<br>
than the active deaths caused by terrorists or other military
<br>
powers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In addition, humans are very nasty enemies as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are hard to stop with simple measures like dams, frame houses, etc.
</em><br>
<p>No argument.  But aging is equally hard to stop.  If you are spending
<br>
more to stop humans relative to what you are spending to stop aging
<br>
then I would argue you are spending your resources inefficiently.
<br>
<p>Now of course to really do this analysis properly, one would
<br>
have to account for Years of Potential Life Lost from terrorist
<br>
acts vs. various diseases, account for the years saved by each $
<br>
spent on defense vs. health care and compute the marginal benefit
<br>
of additional $ spent on defense vs. health care.  It might
<br>
well be that additional $ spent on defense are providing
<br>
more benefit than additional $ spent on health -- because aging
<br>
*is* such a hard problem to solve -- but given the ratios I
<br>
cite above, it seems that more attention should be given to
<br>
determining whether that is really the case.
