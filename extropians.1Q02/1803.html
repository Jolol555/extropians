<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;...Central to the method are two types of artificial intelligence software: 
<br>
hybrid neural networks and genetic algorithms. The software mimics the 
<br>
thought processes of chemists who create new formulas for everything from 
<br>
rubber compounds to rocket fuels, and plastic materials to snack foods, said 
<br>
James M. Caruthers, a professor of chemical engineering. &quot;There is this 
<br>
crazy-haired scientist, called a formulation chemist, who actually mixes dabs 
<br>
of this with dabs of that and stirs it up in a pot — cooks it, more or less —
<br>
&nbsp;and makes new materials,&quot; Caruthers said. &quot;You could say, 'Gee, these guys 
<br>
make this good stuff, and they are lucky.' Except that the people who are 
<br>
very good at it are lucky again and again and again, and they are actually 
<br>
some of the most valuable folks in an organization because they make the new 
<br>
materials.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's part science, it's part intuition.&quot; The different types of software 
<br>
work together in a repeating two-phase cycle of discovery. First, hybrid 
<br>
neural networks analyze the formulas of the numerous catalysts, or other 
<br>
materials, created by the parallel technique. The neural networks determine 
<br>
the properties of the materials, based on their chemical structures. In the 
<br>
second phase, genetic algorithms cull the best materials and eliminate the 
<br>
poor performers, just like survival of the fittest. The algorithms also 
<br>
generate &quot;mutations&quot; of the best materials to create even better versions, 
<br>
and the software determines the chemical structures of those mutations. The 
<br>
resulting formulas are returned to the neural network software, and the cycle 
<br>
starts over again, progressively creating better and better materials, said 
<br>
Venkat Venkatasubramanian, a professor of chemical engineering who has been 
<br>
working with Caruthers to develop the software for more than a decade. 
<br>
<p>Caruthers said he observes how formulation chemists come up with new ideas. 
<br>
Then he models their trains of thought in software programs. &quot;Most experts 
<br>
don't think in terms of equations and mathematics,&quot; he said. &quot;They think in 
<br>
terms of pictures. They have a picture of what goes in, and they have a 
<br>
picture of what comes out. What we should really be trying to do is model 
<br>
this sort of picture-to-picture reasoning that goes on. &quot;I look at eyes. I 
<br>
try to see when the eyes are excited, or a little confused or upset, and try 
<br>
to figure out what is the reasoning behind all of that. We want to learn why 
<br>
experts make the inferences that they do — why they jump from here to here.&quot; 
<br>
The software isn't quite as smart as the human formulation chemists. 
<br>
<p>While software programs can't match the creative brain power of people, they 
<br>
can mimic human thinking while simultaneously computing thousands of 
<br>
formulations, compared to about half a dozen for a human chemist. &quot;No human 
<br>
mind could keep all these balls in the air at the same time,&quot; Caruthers said. 
<br>
&quot;Our idea is to reproduce 60, 70, 80 percent of the way these formulation 
<br>
chemists think, but now the computer can balance all of these balls in the 
<br>
air at the same time.&quot; Neural networks are designed to think more like the 
<br>
human brain than a conventional computer program. The Purdue approach differs 
<br>
from previous methods that have used neural networks because it first takes a 
<br>
reaction's physics and chemistry into account, and then it lets the software 
<br>
take over, determining the properties of the materials. Because it combines 
<br>
known physics and chemistry with the software, it is called a hybrid neural 
<br>
network. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Other methods assume that you know nothing about the physics and the 
<br>
chemistry of a process,&quot; Venkatasubramanian said. &quot;However, in most cases you 
<br>
know something about the physics and chemistry governing a reaction, but that 
<br>
knowledge is not complete enough. &quot;We see how far our fundamental 
<br>
understanding will take us...&gt;&gt;
