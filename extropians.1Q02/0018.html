<em>&gt;I know how you feel. That's why I'd prefer to carry a nuke
</em><br>
<p>For your New Year's Day amusement, let's replace &quot;nuke&quot; with
<br>
&quot;elephant&quot;.
<br>
<p>A tale of Hannibal the Great and his elephants from:
<br>
_The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody_ by Will Cuppy, 1950.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Hamilcar also told Hannibal about elephants and how you must always
<br>
have plenty of these animals to scare the enemy. He attibuted much
<br>
of his own success to elephants and believed they would have won the
<br>
First Punic War for him if things hadn't gone slightly haywire; for
<br>
the war had turned into a naval affair. But even when the fighting
<br>
was on land, the Romans did not scare nearly so well as expected
<br>
(7). The Romans had learned about elephants while fighting Pyrrhus,
<br>
whose elephants defeated him in 275 B.C., and even before that, in
<br>
Alexander's time, King Porus had been undone by his own elephants.
<br>
<p>Thus if history had taught any one thing up to that time, it was
<br>
never to use elephants in war. Don't ask me why Hamilcar did not see
<br>
this. The Carthaginian elephants were trained to rush forward and
<br>
trample the Romans, but only too frequently they would rush backward
<br>
and trample the Carthaginians. If this happed to you, wouldn't you
<br>
notice it? And wouldn't you do something about it?
<br>
<p>Then Hamilcar went to Spain, where he spent eight years in
<br>
perfecting his plans and was drowned in 228 B.C. while crossing a
<br>
stream with a herd of elephants. Hasdrubal the Handsome, who took
<br>
his place, was assassinated a few years later, leaving the command
<br>
to Hannibal, now twenty-six and well versed in his father's routine.
<br>
Hannibal left Spain in 218 B.C. and crossed the Alps in to Italy in
<br>
fifteen days with a large army and thirty-seven elephants, thus
<br>
establishing a record for crossing the Alps with elephants, and
<br>
starting the Second Punic War. Taking elephants across the Alps is
<br>
not as much fun as it sounds. The Alps are difficult enough when
<br>
alone, and elephants are peculiarly fitted for not crossing them. If
<br>
you must take something over the Alps, try chamois. They're built
<br>
for it.
<br>
<p>Believe it or not, all the elephants survived the journey, although
<br>
about half of the soldiers perished. Historians state that Hannibal
<br>
seemed insensible to fatigue throughout the ordeal (9). Nor did he
<br>
ever give way to despair. Whenever a thousand or so of his men
<br>
would fall off an Alp, he would tell the rest to cheer up, the
<br>
elephants were all right. If someone had given him a shove at the
<br>
right moment, much painful history might have been avoided. It's the
<br>
little things that count (10).
<br>
<p>The number of Hannibal's elephants, thirty-seven, is said by
<br>
Polybius to have been inscribed by Hannibal's own hand on a brazen
<br>
plate in Italy.  Polybius read it himself. Yet a modern historian
<br>
has recently given the figure as forty, perhaps from a natural
<br>
tendency to deal in round numbers. Elephants do not come in round
<br>
numbers. You have one elephant, or three, or thirty-seven.
<br>
<p>Hannibal expected to get more elephants that he had left in Spain
<br>
with his brother Hasdurbal, but the Romans cut the supply line.
<br>
During his fifteen years in Italy, Hannibal never had enough
<br>
elephants to suit him. Most of the original group succumbed to the
<br>
climate, and he was always begging Carthage for more, but the people
<br>
at home were stingy. They would ask if he thought they were made of
<br>
elephants and what had he done with the elephants they sent before?
<br>
Sometimes, when he hadn't an elephant to his name, he would manage
<br>
to wrangle a few from somewhere, a feat which strikes me as his
<br>
greatest claim to our attention.
<br>
<p>Like his father before him, Hannibal never noticed that he made much
<br>
more progress without any elephants at all. We hear nothing of them
<br>
at the Battle of the Ticino, and there were only a few at Trebia.
<br>
The last one died before the Battle of Trasimene, where Hannibal
<br>
simply erased the Romans for the time being. Hannibal was again
<br>
fresh out of elephants at Cannae, the greatest of his victories in
<br>
the first three years of his Italian campaign.
<br>
<p>I have a theory about Hannibal's failure to take Rome when he had
<br>
the chance after Cannae and his strange inactivity for the next
<br>
dozen years, when he only held out and nothing more. He was waiting
<br>
for something. His brother Hasdrubal reached Italy with ten
<br>
elephants in 207 B.C., but they behaved so badly that they had to be
<br>
killed by their own side and Hannibal never saw them. Carthage sent
<br>
forty more after a while. They were shipped to Sardinia by mistake.
<br>
<p>So Hannibal went back home where he could get what he wanted. At
<br>
Zama, the final showdown of the Second Punic War fought near
<br>
Carthage in 203 B.C., he had his way at last. He placed eighty
<br>
elephants in the front line of battle. They turned on the
<br>
Carthaginians, and Scipio Africanus did the rest.
<br>
<p>Hannibal never succeeded in his effort to stir up another war. The
<br>
Carthaginians were tired of it all. He tried to interest Antiochus
<br>
the Great of Syria in a scheme involving elephants and was forced to
<br>
flee from Carthage when the Romans demanded his person. He then
<br>
wandered through Asia for years, finally taking refuge with Prusias,
<br>
King of Bithynia, the only true friend he had left in the world. One
<br>
day he discovered that Prusias had notified the Romans to come and
<br>
get him. He took poison, dying at the age of sixty-four.
<br>

(7) The Romans captured more than a hundred elephants in one battle
in the First Punic War. They sent them to Rome to amuse the populace.
(9) He was riding on an elephant.
(10) Livy informs us that Hannibal split the huge Alpine rocks with
vinegar to break a path for the elephants. Vinegar was a high
explosive in 218 B.C., but not before or since.
