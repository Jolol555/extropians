<p><em>&gt; Let's say that there are a hundred people on an island (let's call it

<em>&gt; Spaceship Earth); the majority, say 85, eat meat and vegetables, but realizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their numbers are growing and that latrine space is overtaking cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range and farmland, a few are working on ways to get our eggs out of a tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basket before we all die of overpopulation-induced pollution and starvation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's say that the other fifteen have sworn fealty to a murderous Thugee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology, and the only people they will not kill are their own.  What are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 85 to do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Hunt down and convert, or, failing that, kill the 15 so that all may live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their lives unendangered and those working on liberation may continue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Join the 15 to avoid being murdered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Blithely ignore the 15 and hope that one's own number does not come up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Try to understand the killers as members of an alternative yet equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid lifestyle and attempt constructive and nonjudgemental dialogue with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) Assert that the 85 deserve such a fate because of real or imagined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical wrongs and await their fate with a sense that an incomprehensibele
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or maybe comprehensible, but these would most likely convert) divine justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was being meted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I stand squarely with alternative #1.  I see Samantha as embracing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives #4 or #5 or perhaps a syncretism of the two.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not very sure how useful a discussion will be that starts off with such
<br>
a biased framework, but here goes with two observations:
<br>
<p>1. Consider how the 85 should react if it turns out that not all of them
<br>
pick option 1. Should rational dissent be suppressed in such a situation?
<br>
Should the option 1 people regard option 4 people as their enemy? What if
<br>
it's actually a minority of these hypothetical 85 who pick option 1, but
<br>
they sincerely believe that they are right? What if some people pick option
<br>
1 initially, but then change their minds and want option 4 instead? Etc.
<br>
<p>2. There are of course more options, and the options are not mutually
<br>
exclusive. So for example, political dialogue and military action are not
<br>
mutually exclusive (as current US action in Afghanistan, supported in
<br>
general by the international community, is showing). As JR Molloy pointed
<br>
out on the related real-world thread, war is diplomacy carried on by other
<br>
means. What if some of the 85 want some interesting combination of 1 &amp; 4.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I continue to have misgivings about whether further exploration of
<br>
such a biased scenario will be enlightening, so I'll stop now!
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Geraint
