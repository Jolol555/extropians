<em>&gt; So, question, why stay in Florida?
</em><br>
<p>Many people have written me recently asking this same question.  I have been
<br>
invited to leave Florida for various U.S. states and various countries.
<br>
There have been many offers of hospitality and welcoming committees!  It is
<br>
really touching.
<br>
<p>I currently have an aging mother with cancer in Florida, and my partner has
<br>
a elderly mother with Alzheimer's.  Neither parent can do without us right
<br>
now.  However, if we had no ties, I certainly would be interested in moving
<br>
to a better location.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have heard most clearances are not revoked as long as your are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;out&quot; so it can't be used to presure you.  Is that true?
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  They only care about your vulnerability to blackmail.  If you
<br>
can convince them that you can't be coerced, you are safe.  This is a recent
<br>
change since I got in.  Originally, I should have been excluded
<br>
automatically, but I was a special case.  I was accidentally exposed to high
<br>
level information and had to be cleared.  They didn't really have the option
<br>
to deny my clearance or bar my access to stuff I had already seen.  They
<br>
cleared me to get me into the system and under their control.  I have since
<br>
found contracts in the private sector so I am no longer under direct
<br>
government control.  (Although technically, I am not allowed to meet foreign
<br>
citizens, publish any materials, give any speeches, or even undergo
<br>
anesthesia without prior written permission from the U.S. government.  Now
<br>
that I think about it, I may not be allowed out of the country.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It just seemed like you were painting the dark side too darkly for today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I think I was wrong in that opinion.  Thanks for the reminder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if it is darn unpleasant to acknowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I get bitter and disgruntled sometimes.  I don't mean to counter the
<br>
Extropian Principle of Dynamic Optimism.  But I do think it is important to
<br>
accurately see how bad things are so we can work more efficiently to avoid
<br>
or solve problems.  I find a lot of discussions on this list simply naive.
<br>
Happy talk or ignoring problems won't make things better.  Accurately
<br>
perceiving the world and then excelling anyway is an even better course
<br>
toward success.  I think I am doing so well in my life because I have
<br>
directly attacked these problems head-on and found a way to work around
<br>
them.  I am not sure I would be as intelligent, creative, or successful if I
<br>
had previously moved from Florida to a more accepting environment.
