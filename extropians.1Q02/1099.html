<em>&gt; One of the things that really irritates me about this particular trend as it

<p><p><p>This is not true afaik, at least it is not true in efforts to 
<br>
get such laws in place in various areas of California.  I have 
<br>
seen domestic partners laws only pass or even get seriously 
<br>
proposed too many times only if they included various non-gay 
<br>
partnerings also. It can also be pointed out that hetero unions 
<br>
of sufficient duration automatically are treated as (common-law) 
<br>
marriages in many areas of the country.  And I have never known 
<br>
a HR department to demand a marriage license as proof of 
<br>
eligibility for work related partner benefits of apparently 
<br>
straight couples.  So I don't think there is that much of a case 
<br>
for what you describe.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; just piling one inequity on top of another.  As a heterosexual, the only way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can enjoy &quot;domestic partner&quot; status is to get married, with the monumental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; load of crap that goes along with that.  It is arguable that homosexuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will actually get the better end of the deal under the various existing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed domestic partner laws and regulations in many places.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p><p>You also might want to remember that most of us don't want 
<br>
&quot;domestic partner&quot; laws.  We want to be able to have the same 
<br>
rights to marry and have our unions recognized as everyone else. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;domestic partner&quot; stuff is a dodge from many sources, 
<br>
most of them not gay, to avoid running head on into 
<br>
fundamentally relgious objects to lgbt marriages.   There are no 
<br>
&quot;special rights&quot; involved.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If we are going to have the State implementing these kinds of laws at all, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we should ditch marriage laws altogether and replace it with some form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of flexible domestic partnership scheme that doesn't have so much historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baggage.  I know a lot of heterosexual individuals who don't want to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; married but could benefit greatly from a domestic partnership structure in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same way that homosexual individuals could.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I think partnering laws, call it marriage or what you will, can 
<br>
indeed benefit from a lot of reform.  However, whatever these 
<br>
laws are, they should be open to all people of whatever 
<br>
sexualities and genders and not just officially sanctioned and 
<br>
approved groupings.
