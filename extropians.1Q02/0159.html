V6#364 Aid for Afghanistan Brian D Williams wrote a whole buncha stuff:
<br>
<p>First things first: Your comment regarding &quot;Glass Houses&quot; - I couldn't agree
<br>
more that Australia is far from acting responsibly in some areas: our
<br>
treatment of refugees, our continued support for the government of Indonesia
<br>
despite it's appalling human rights record, our favoured nation status with
<br>
China, our failure to support the Kyoto accords, the treatment of indigenous
<br>
Australians - these are all areas that Australia needs to work on &amp; work on
<br>
urgently. For my part, I am doing what I can within my country's political
<br>
system to effect change on these issues. No nation on earth is perfect. What
<br>
I am suggesting is that the US has a chance to offer real leadership in key
<br>
areas, a chance to lead by example rather than ride roughshod over the rest
<br>
of the world. I suggest that a policy that would promote friendship with the
<br>
US rather than hatred is in your own best interests.
<br>
<p>&amp; now to other issues:
<br>
<p>&quot;Nonsense. The Taliban did not even exist when we funded rebel
<br>
groups in Afghanistan to oppose the Soviet invasion.&quot;
<br>
<p>I believe ample evidence of US involvement in this issue was given earlier
<br>
in v6#363-4 including the direct funding of Bin Laaden by the US government.
<br>
<p><p>ME: &quot;There are people in this world who hate America &amp; America has given
<br>
them plenty of good reasons to have that hate.&quot; 
<br>
YOU &quot;A matter of opinion, an opinion we don't share.&quot;
<br>
<p>Been to Bhopal? Seen what the US government has done in South America?
<br>
Remember Vietnam? Laos? Cambodia? Indonesia? The Balkans? Shit - remember
<br>
the nuclear tests in Utah on your own citizens?
<br>
<p>YOU: &quot;You're claiming the Soviets were the legitimately elected government
<br>
of Afghanistan?&quot;
<br>
<p>Absolutely not! I do think it is irresponsible to just abandon a country
<br>
like Afghanistan once your immediate objectives have been obtained. Leaving
<br>
behind a power vacuum in Afghanistan has lead to years of war, opportunism
<br>
by fundamentalist elements from other nations (eg Pakistan) and all the
<br>
misery &amp; suffering has surprise, surprise turned around &amp; bitten you on the
<br>
arse. 
<br>
<p>YOU: &quot;America is the freeist and most just country on the planet.&quot;
<br>
<p>Which is why you have such a large prison population and why your justice
<br>
system (the envy of lawyers everywhere! ka-ching!) largely seems to depend
<br>
on what legal counsel you can afford or who you are connected with (remember
<br>
OJ, Iran/Contra?) - and yes, I do know that it is only slightly better here
<br>
in Oz. 
<br>
<p>Oh &amp; the side bets seem like a good investment to me, given &quot;fuck you buddy&quot;
<br>
attitudes like yours &amp; the ease with which terrorist operations can be
<br>
carried out by folks with a high school level knowledge of chemistry &amp; a
<br>
mobile phone. 
<br>
<p>This all getting a little silly. Much as I enjoy the cut &amp; thrust of a good
<br>
argument (and I admit have been given much to think on), I doubt that many
<br>
of us are here for sessions of moral finger pointing. Perhaps it would be
<br>
best for the list itself to let these issues lie &amp; return to debates that
<br>
are a bit more on-topic.
