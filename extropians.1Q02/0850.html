<p><em>&gt; Ultimately I hope every software engineer out there has a dream

</em><br>
<p>This one does.  The increased productivity I gain just from automating
<br>
my own work is most of the basis of my approx. $100K salary.  The tricks
<br>
are to make sure that those who decide my income know who wrote the
<br>
stuff that let them look like heroes to their bosses and customers, and
<br>
to keep making things better (pay based on continued acceleration of
<br>
others' productivity, not merely on getting it to a certain level then
<br>
keeping it there).  So long as there's new products, there are new
<br>
processes to improve...and when there aren't, the company is dying, so
<br>
it's time to look for a new job anyway.  (Been there, done that,
<br>
unfortunately.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;I just hope that the speed of the change is moderated so that people are OK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Sometimes I have nightmare visions of being ostracised at the local market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;and having people throw rocks at my house out of the fear of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;(potentially) very smart little grey box in my office.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I'm ever in that situation (which implies moving away from an area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where many residents would have a similar box), I'd probably also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rich enough to buy the local police and have the rock-throwers arrested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; en masse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That isn't the point though, is it?  The point is how to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding technology including AI enough of a boon to everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is not seen as so threatening as to lead to violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly escalating into great danger to developers and even to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars which would slow down the advancement we seek.  It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very important issue.
</em><br>
<p>This looks like a chicken-and-the-egg problem.  A thing can, usually,
<br>
only be a boon to those who would take advantage of it.  To those who
<br>
vigorously reject it, the same thing has a harder time being anything
<br>
but negative.  To those who vigorously reject it because of
<br>
preconceptions that it is nothing but negative...
<br>
<p>And how do those who do benefit from it, deal with the rejecters,
<br>
especially if (when) the rejecters come to believe that the benefit is
<br>
at the rejecters' expense (to explain why the rejecters have yet to
<br>
benefit from what they reject)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Attention, oppressed masses of the Muslim world.  What do you say we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beat the infidels at their own game?  Lo, they have thought of a way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bring Allah's wisdom to the masses.  See how they tremble in fear when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they contemplate its potential existence.  Let us bring their nightmare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to life, and in so doing, bring about our new golden age.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are actually &quot;whiter&quot; versions of this that could be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important in getting to the Singularity relatively peaceably and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in one piece.
</em><br>
<p>Such as?  (And how do we finagle getting them into use?)
