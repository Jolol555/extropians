<br>
<em>&gt; This will surely be an important part of the project. Another part will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning to think in networks of different cultures. I would also include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quasi-religous memes like &quot;&lt;my nation&gt; is the best in the world&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-religious memes like &quot;&lt;my opinion&gt; has more right to exist than yours&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>What we really need is a machine that can accurately identify incorrect
<br>
thinking.
<br>
Then we can discard opinions altogether.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
