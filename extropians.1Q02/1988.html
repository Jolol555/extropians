I think there is another problem, in Australia at least...
<br>
Some time ago I looked into the idea of getting councils to plant fruit 
<br>
trees rather than decorative ones, and found out that it was either against 
<br>
some law or against some set of rules or guidelines. (I can't remember 
<br>
exactly... it was about 20 years ago that I looked into this.)
<br>
<p>The point is that there must be some reasoning behind preventing this... 
<br>
never found out what...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- maybe it is to lessen the cost of cleaning up putrefying fruit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- maybe it is because previous attempts to do this produced local squabbles
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- maybe people snuck around and stripped trees of fruit and sold it at 
<br>
local markets
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- maybe moneyed interests in the local fruit trade were just afraid of 
<br>
their profits going down...
<br>
<p>It sounds like an interesting question. If I wasn't so busy I might be 
<br>
tempted to look into it... unfortunately it will have to wait until after 
<br>
my uploading. :-)

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
