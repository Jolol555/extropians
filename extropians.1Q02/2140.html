<em>&gt; If you're on a good thing, stick to it? What do you think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe (although I don't practice as much as I would like) in early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adoption of technology. Hanging on to the old for security 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addresses the symptoms of the issue, not the cause.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can't you find a more modern calculator that does the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job as the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one, plus more? Assuming that you can but choose not to, why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to use more advanced calculator features?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Simon
</em><br>
<p>Doug is making new rockets to fly us all into space. If he's happy with his
<br>
old calculator, I've got no beef with that.
