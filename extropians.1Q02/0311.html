<p>
Well, since I know that there are a number of people here who get off on
<br>
cool weird and odd aircraft and spacecraft, as well as cool programs, I
<br>
want to shout to everybody to check out X-Plane from Laminar Research
<br>
(www.x-plane.com). This is the coolest flight simulator I've ever seen.
<br>
It not only provides the greatest level of visual, navigational, and
<br>
aural detail of any flight sim, along with the largest collection of
<br>
aircraft, but it allows you to design your own aircraft, instrument
<br>
panels, parts, skins, as well as ground objects and airfields. It EVEN
<br>
allows you to decide what PLANET you want to fly on. Fly on Mars,
<br>
anyone?
<br>
There are numerous user websites out there where you can download other
<br>
people's aircraft designs. You can build and fly not only prop planes,
<br>
but jets, HELICOPTERS, and even ROCKET PLANES and Missiles! One user
<br>
site has designs for such things as a Titan Missile, a Gemini Capsule in
<br>
both orbit and reentry, a DynaSoar spaceplane, and the standard issue
<br>
X-Plane comes with the Space Shuttle which you can fly on a reentry from
<br>
orbit into Edwards, White Sands, or Kennedy Space Center.
<br>
You can fly vintage oddball planes like various German jet and rocket
<br>
planes from WWII, as well as a super flying wing bomber design that was
<br>
never built. You can fly various real historical X planes, from the X-1
<br>
and X-15 to the XVF-1 Pogo (I know Spike will get off on that one) to
<br>
the current X-45 Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.
<br>
<p>The Classic version of X-Plane is available for free download, and I
<br>
bought the current version on CD at K-Mart for just $29 a few months
<br>
ago. This program gets my vote for Most Extropic Sim.
