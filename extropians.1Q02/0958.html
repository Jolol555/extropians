&quot;I can repeat the question, but am I bright enough to ask it?&quot;
<br>
<p>THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2002
<br>
<p>The 5th Annual Edge Question reflects the spirit of the Edge motto: &quot;To
<br>
arrive at the edge of the world's knowledge, seek out the most complex and
<br>
sophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each
<br>
other the questions they are asking themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>The 2002 Edge Question is:
<br>
<p>&quot;WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION? ... WHY?&quot;
<br>
<p>I asked Edge contributors for &quot;hard-edge&quot; questions, derived from
<br>
empirical results or experience specific to their expertise, that render
<br>
visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefine who and what we are.
<br>
The goal was a series of interrogatives in which &quot;thinking smart prevails
<br>
over the anaesthesiology of wisdom.&quot;
<br>
<p>The project - which consists of 93 contributions and 48,000 words to date
<br>
- is available on the EDGE home page: <a href="http://www.edge.org">http://www.edge.org</a>.
<br>
<p>There are two files, one which links to individual responses for reading
<br>
and printing, (see excerpts below).
<br>
<p>A larger file - &quot;Printer version&quot; - which contains the complete 47,500
<br>
text - is also available.

<p>WER NICHT FRAGT, BLEIBT DUMM
<br>
<p>Der Schleier des Nichtwissens ist noch nicht verschwunden: Wer richtige
<br>
Antworten will, muß wissen, was er sucht - Eine Umfrage zum Jahr 2002
<br>
unter Wissenschaftlern und Künstlern
<br>
<p>Als Kultur noch nicht numeriert wurde, lud, wenn wir Richard Wagner
<br>
glauben können, der Landgraf von Thüringen seine Edlen zum &quot;Sängerkrieg
<br>
auf Wartburg&quot;, wo er Preisfragen stellte, deren berühmteste lautete: Könnt
<br>
ihr der Liebe Wesen mir ergründen? Der Verleger und Literaturagent John
<br>
Brockman, der Sängerkriege nun im Internet veranstaltet, knüpft zum
<br>
Jahresanfang gern an diese Tradition an (F.A.Z. vom 9. Januar 2001). Sein
<br>
Tannhäuser mag Steven Pinker heißen, sein Wolfram von Eschenbach sich als
<br>
Richard Dawkins zu erkennen geben: ihnen und ihren Mitstreitern wäre wohl
<br>
zuzutrauen, auch Spekulationen über des Landgrafen Lieblingsthema
<br>
anzustellen. Brockmans Koryphäen der &quot;Dritten Kultur&quot;, ob sie nun, wie
<br>
Dawkins, in Oxford sich der Evolutionsbiologie widmen oder, wie Alan Alda,
<br>
am Broadway Wissenschaftler rezitieren, kennen keine Tabus. Alles ist
<br>
erlaubt, nichts bleibt ausgeklammert im intellektuellen Spiel. Am Ende
<br>
aber geht es auch in seiner Wartburg, die elektronisch unter www.edge.org
<br>
zu erreichen ist, um uns und unsere unerklärte und offenbar unerklärliche
<br>
Bestimmung. Im neuen Jahr fragt Brockman nicht, sondern läßt wieder einmal
<br>
Fragen stellen. Im Internet sind die Beiträge von heute an zu finden. Wir
<br>
drucken gleichzeitig mit dem Start des Forums eine Auswahl der
<br>
kommentierten Fragen, zum Teil in leicht gekürzter Fassung, in deutscher
<br>
Übersetzung.

like crabs, penguins, and chimpanzees, and not the chosen protégés of this

or that God?&quot;
<br>
<p>Recent events around the world remind us of historical phenomena observed

&quot;Are space and time fundamental concepts or are they approximations to

other, more subtle, ideas that still await our discovery?&quot;

&quot;Is it possible to know what is good and what is evil?&quot;
<br>
<p>For the past four centuries, the attempt to answer this question has been

<p>By &quot;life on Earth&quot; I mean the variety of life, the multitude of species,

the dazzling array of ecosystems they create from the permanent snow

<p>People with autism can be affected to varying degrees, but their principal

mental characteristics are that they have difficulty in fitting in with

&quot;In view of globalization, which is here to stay, and the events of

be replaced by a new version of 21st century souls. ....[more]

&quot;How are behaviors encoded in DNA?&quot;
<br>
<p>Many animals have quite substantial hereditary behavior. Moreover, these
<br>

&quot;What kind of system of 'coding' of semantic information does the brain
<br>
use?&quot;
<br>
<p>My question now is actually a version of the question I was asking myself
<br>
