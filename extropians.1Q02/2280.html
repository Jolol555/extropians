<p>&lt;&lt; Does Bill really need $60 billion?  Sheesh, won't a paltry couple of 
<br>
billion
<br>
&nbsp;do anymore? &gt;&gt;
<br>
Far be it from me to defend this generations' Citizen Kane, but, he and Paul 
<br>
Allen marketed a mediocre product very well, and wisely have shared their 
<br>
operating system codes for over 20 years. Thus, has pushed them as the 
<br>
chieftans of operating systems, browsers and software. Apple Computer, with a 
<br>
superior operating system, held on like a miser to a copper penny and was 
<br>
thus trounced in the market, and has been, if memory serves, supported by 
<br>
their chief rival, MicroGod.  So who should control the wealth that Apple 
<br>
essentially handed over to him? Is Bubba Clinton or Richard Nixon the correct 
<br>
people to have us decide how rich one can get? 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Granted, again, this is from my own personal experience ... but it is the
<br>
overwhelming majority of rich people I've known who have avoided doing real
<br>
work and it is the middle class or poorer people I've observed who have done
<br>
the most work, often to ease the life for the &quot;poor&quot; rich blokes.
<br>
<p>O. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, if the middle class folks wish to continue being the victim, whose 
<br>
fault is that? The rich who have inherited their wealth are, indeed, 
<br>
frequently schmucks, but give money to the kiddies is kind of a right, don't 
<br>
you think?  Also, what's real work, as you define it. Does the poor ditch 
<br>
digger or burger flipper, deserve more money then some lazy insurance 
<br>
salesman, or some keyboard cowboy, such as myself? A Union Bricklayer 
<br>
assuredly gets more valuta then I, but I don't wish to bust my ass working 
<br>
physically as hard as said, Bricklayer.
<br>
<p>Envy is a piss-poor reason to push for changes. There are more useful reasons 
<br>
to honk for change, such as better, fairer, freer, technologies. Even, 
<br>
Freeman (the socialist) Dyson has advocated this. So lets focus on thangs 
<br>
that make people happier, richer, and more secure.
