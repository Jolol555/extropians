</em><br>
<p>Well, the Sauron were gene engineered to be superior soldiers, nothing
<br>
more: superior clotting, healing, strength, and, of course, agression.
<br>
Then they built combat cyborgs as well for similar purposes. At the end
<br>
of the war against the Saurons, when the First Spartan Empire was
<br>
collapsing, one Sauron battleship made it to the odd, out in the boonies
<br>
planet of Haven, where the Co-Dominium had dumped the most recalcitrant
<br>
ethnic groups the US and the Soviets didn't want to deal with on earth:
<br>
the Navaho, Cherokee, Afghanis, Israelis, etc. who had, in Haven's harsh
<br>
climate, bred into something of natural supermen themselves. They
<br>
interbred with the survivors of the last Sauron ship for hundreds of
<br>
years during the dark ages between the first and second Spartan &quot;Empires
<br>
of Man&quot;.
<br>
<p>The Spartan empires have had religious proscriptions against sentient
<br>
machines, and also maintain a blockade against the star system of the
<br>
Mote race, a species with a tendency for exponential population growth
<br>
and breeding individuals optimized for special tasks, like battle or
<br>
engineering, diplomacy or management, etc... (see &quot;The Mote in God's
<br>
Eye&quot; and &quot;The Gripping Hand&quot;, where references to the Sauron war are
<br>
evident). The Spartans are also quite imperialist in their dealings with
<br>
human colonized in the past being rediscovered (see &quot;King David's
<br>
Spaceship&quot;) where a planets status in the empire is determined by its
<br>
indigenous spaceflight capability at the time when it is inducted into
<br>
the Second Empire.
<br>
<p>Sparta was originally founded as an isolationist Constitutional
<br>
Monarchist Republic, much like Ancient Sparta, where individuals earn
<br>
their citizenship, with an aversion to foreign involvements. This
<br>
isolationism changed when an ambitious Terran Senator sought to subvert
<br>
the Spartan republic with a guerrilla insurrection of 'non-citizen'
<br>
transportees funded and supported by Senator Bronson's industrial wealth
<br>
and technical help from the Japanese planet Meiji (see &quot;Prince of
<br>
Mercenaries&quot;, &quot;Prince of Sparta&quot;, and &quot;Go Tell The Spartans&quot;.)
<br>
<p>The evolution over time of this idealistic republic into a repressive
<br>
Empire is supposed to be a lesson to the citizens of the US about the
<br>
dangers of trading freedom for security, and of staring too long into
<br>
the abyss.
