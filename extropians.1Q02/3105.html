<em>&gt; Your proposal is not a &quot;solution&quot; as all the possibilities of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disaster go with you.  Solve the problem here or elsewhere, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still the same problem.  Running off to build space colonies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will simply distract from actually facing the problem.
</em><br>
<p>I would throw my lot behind the proposed idea of space colonies, contingent on developing a low cost way to build them (such as a
<br>
space elevator) or mining asteroids or the moon. Otherwise, a series of floating cities very high in the sky would probably offer
<br>
good enough coverage for most purposes.
<br>
<p>For those new here, I have my own project at <a href="http://ascension.webhop.org">http://ascension.webhop.org</a> for developing a technological society. The project focuses
<br>
more on a new theory of social systems (which it seems most people neglect or have great misunderstanding with) and I didn't expect
<br>
it to begin operating anytime soon, as I expect the neccessary technology, social knowledge and motivation to reach maturity only
<br>
near the year 2050.
<br>
<p><p>Should we have to learn the lesson of &quot;putting all our eggs in our basket&quot; the hard or the easy way? If you spend a good chunck of
<br>
you money to buy insurance for yourself or your family, you might consider this additional coverage. And when did the insurance
<br>
agents ever give us discounts?
<br>
<p>Why do we have to think of insurance in a negative way? If you insured your house from theft, then does that mean you would sit
<br>
around waiting to get robbed? If you insured your yourself from accidents, then do you beglect yourself so much that you get into
<br>
them?
<br>
<p><p>How can we run away from the problems on Earth by buying insurance? How do we know our plans work, or do we even have any plans at
<br>
all? Why not have a catch-all backup system that can pay dividends, by pioneering space-related technology and also giving those
<br>
technologically primitive earthlings a motivation to get into space?
<br>
<p>By the time a doomsday asteroid comes, its too late to hug the Buddha's leg, as a Chinese idiom goes. Do you think you can evacuate
<br>
enough people in 3 day's time, or even a year's time? Meanwhile, I would probably consider signing up for cryogenics, but the
<br>
cryogenics storage center had better reside somewhere *not* on planet Earth.
<br>
<p><p>See you in the future.
