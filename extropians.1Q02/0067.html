<p>Sometimes I think science would move forward a bit faster if we

<p>Since it would appear the individuals involved are willing to settle

for half-a-loaf (a clone, rather than a reanimated individual) then
<br>
there may be less need to split hairs on what will work and what will not.

<p>No, but given what we think we now know (they pysical basis for short
<br>
and long term memory) -- it *should* be relatively easy to do concrete
<br>
pysical experiments to determine the relative *rate* of loss.
<br>
<p>I suspect Anders or Eugene could do these (or at least they know people
<br>
who could do these) experiments.  I expect one could raise the certainty
<br>
of potentially successful reanimations (assuming sufficiently advanced nanotech
<br>
to accomplish this) to near the level of scientific/medical certainty
<br>
for say the recovery of people suffering heart failure.  E.g. physicians
<br>
&quot;know&quot; hearts damaged &quot;this much&quot; are essentially unrecoverable, so physicians
<br>
knowing &quot;this much&quot; neural interconnectivity loss (based on time elapsed
<br>
rate of decay) are essentially unrecoverable.
<br>
<p>Its really a shame that more scientists do not take this more seriously.
<br>
There are several separate questions of scientific importance: (a) How
<br>
long after &quot;death&quot; do basic cellular structures remain intact such
<br>
that highly interventionist biochemistry &amp; biotechnology could
<br>
return those cells to a functional state?; (b) How long after &quot;death&quot;
<br>
does the basic synaptic &quot;architecture&quot; of the brain remain intact?;
<br>
(c) How long after &quot;death&quot; are there sufficient &quot;fingerprints&quot;
<br>
of the preexisting synaptic &quot;architecture&quot; that you can reproduce
<br>
it with relative accuracy (potentially via a computer simulation, should
<br>
regenerating it in its physical instantiation prove very difficult)?.
<br>
<p>Exploration of these areas would allow a much greater degree of certainty
<br>
with regard to the verification of &quot;deadness&quot;.  For the more macabre,
<br>
see: <a href="http://www.graphicszone.net/monty_python/hgsounds.htm">http://www.graphicszone.net/monty_python/hgsounds.htm</a>
<br>
search for: &quot;Just Die Already&quot;...  Any lackey can claim &quot;I'm not dead&quot;
<br>
what we need is proof.
