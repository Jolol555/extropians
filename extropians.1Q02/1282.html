<em>&gt; It does not follow that a guy asking a guy for a date is going

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; gay guys screw every time opportunity knocks in any case.  So it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not follow that asking for a date is illegal.
</em><br>
<p>Just because it's illogical, you think it isn't the law?  Judges routinely
<br>
assume that someone who meets a guy in a gay bar and then leaves with him to
<br>
go to a hotel is going to have sex.  Merely sharing a hotel room is illegal
<br>
cohabitation in Florida.  The cops don't have to prove sex, just that they
<br>
went to a hotel proves they are guilty as charged.  This isn't theoretical,
<br>
this is how cops do sting operations against gays.  The solicit someone to
<br>
come to their hotel room, and they don't even have to mention sex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nor does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow that the cops can know what someone is loitering for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily. So just standing around is certainly not illegal.
</em><br>
<p>This also doesn't matter for Florida law.  Mere &quot;loitering&quot; is a crime even
<br>
if they can't prove it is for gay sex, prostitution, drugs, or other
<br>
purposes.  You can even be arrested if they catch you not carrying ID in
<br>
Florida!  There is even a law allowing the police to detain you on
<br>
&quot;suspicion&quot; without ever having to specify suspicion of what.  It also is
<br>
possible to get arrested for resisting arrest with no other charges.  The
<br>
law doesn't have to make sense.  Cops routinely fall back to these charges
<br>
if other charges fail.  I have seen dismissed drunk-driving cases turn into
<br>
sex-crimes cases because the guy had a date in the car.  I have seen
<br>
political activists writing columns for a newsletter get charged with
<br>
conspiracy to incite others to commit illegal acts.  I have seen lesbian
<br>
couples have their own children taken away just because they were gay.  I
<br>
have seen adoptions reversed when the man admitted have a homosexual affair.
<br>
I have seen people kicked off school boards or barred from public office
<br>
just for being gay.  Being gay, having gay sex, or hoping to have gay sex is
<br>
illegal in Florida.  Breaking these laws has serious consequences and is
<br>
routinely enforced on a small segment of the population.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to have a pretty strained concept of law.
</em><br>
<p>This is not some theoretical rant or my strange interpretation of the
<br>
statutes.  My partner and I routinely bail gays out of the local jail for
<br>
these ridiculous charges and help them get legal help.  I know this sounds
<br>
absurd in modern America, but welcome to my world.
<br>
<p>It is illegal for me to cohabitate with my partner.  We could be hauled off
<br>
to jail and registered as sex offenders just for being a gay couple.  They
<br>
don't even have to prove sexual contact under Florida law.  We had to
<br>
struggle to buy a house together because it is illegal for us to cohabitate
<br>
in Florida.  We had problems getting insurance because of known illegal
<br>
activity in the house.  My professional memberships, certifications and
<br>
government clearances have all been challenged because of my illegal
<br>
activity.  It is a constant battle just to live where I live, live with whom
<br>
I live, work in my chosen profession, and do business with the organizations
<br>
I do.  I am not making this stuff up.
