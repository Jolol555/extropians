<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact that I present a controversial and unpopular worldview,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you feel is going to make people (especially those who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent and respectable, as you say) feel negatively towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Extropians as a whole?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, the fact that you presented a ludicrous and wildly irrational conspiracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory, prompts reasonable people to either repudiate or ignore you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know, many called what I presented &quot;ludicrous&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wildly irrational&quot; ... yet nobody's been able to really give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons why other than lots of poo-pooing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say that while unattractive and however improbable my conspiracy theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, it coincides with the recorded history and track record of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States government.
</em><br>
<p>The problem in your logical framework is to make the leap of saying
<br>
&quot;This group (the US gov't) allegedly committed these acts and made these
<br>
plans 40 years ago, so its rather obvious that they most likely set this
<br>
situation up.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even if such plans were made during the Kennedy Administration (which
<br>
there is significant testimony against), this means absolutely NOTHING.
<br>
Do you know why? Because the US government, since the end of WWII, has
<br>
consistently and continuously made plans for almost ANY turn of events
<br>
and contingencies that you can possibly imagine, from a resurgence of
<br>
the Nazi regieme to the dominance of the Soviet Union, all the way to
<br>
nuclear war and invasion by aliens from outer space. The fact that ONE
<br>
of these plans, allegedly devised 40 years ago, bears a resemblence to
<br>
recent events is to be no surprise. Many events in the last 60 years
<br>
have in fact resembled various scenario plans devised by the government.
<br>
Many plans devised and gamed out on computers have resulted in such
<br>
unacceptable results (i.e. nuclear war being unwinnable) that defense
<br>
planners have pushed for an end to deployment of nuclear weapons as
<br>
military devices.
<br>
<p>I think that the fact that recent events may have been previously
<br>
scenarioed in war gaming is a good reason why the US has been able to
<br>
respond so decisively in the past 4 months.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Back in World War I, we let a passenger ship (the Lusitania) get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sunk.  It was carrying munitions, and people were unaware of it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch05.htm">http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch05.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;The Lusitania was a luxury liner that had been built in part with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   government money and obliged to serve the country in time of war. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   addition to passengers, the Lusitania was carrying munitions. When it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   arrived in British waters a German submarine sank it, and 1,198 people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   died, including 128 Americans. In Britain and the United States,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   people were outraged. American newspapers stated as fact that no war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   material had been aboard the Lusitania. The secondary explosion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   munitions on board was erroneously described as a second torpedo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Newspaper editors described submarine warfare as cruel and barbaric --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   too barbaric ever to be employed by Americans.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow, the media tried to cover it up even back then.  Surprised?
</em><br>
<p>I fail to see how you can make the leap of logic that because the
<br>
Lusitania was carrying munitions, and that the media covered up this
<br>
fact after it was sunk, that this somehow means that the allies &quot;let&quot; it
<br>
get sunk. This is rather representative of your lack of logical
<br>
faculties in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We sent countless people to Indochina to be slaughtered.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called it &quot;the Vietnam war&quot;, right?  I'd like to read this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book sometime:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.guerrillanews.com/war_conspiracy/war_intro.html">http://www.guerrillanews.com/war_conspiracy/war_intro.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>The Vietnam War happened, which is no big secret in the world. I find it
<br>
rather indicitavely hyperbolic of you to say that we 'sent countless
<br>
people to Indochina to be slaughtered'. In fact, we know exactly how
<br>
many Americans were killed, just over 50,000, so the number wasn't
<br>
&quot;countless&quot;. We counted them quite well, thanks. 
<br>
<p>What, btw, does all this have to do with your paranoid delusions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who here has heard of Watergate?  We're not even sure what it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was all about, but it was of high enough significance to cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nixon to resign.  That's gotta be one big skeleton in that closet.
</em><br>
<p>We know very well what it was about, thanks. Nixon was paranoid about
<br>
collusion between the McGovern campaign and media reporters and
<br>
publishers (not undeserved) and wanted to investigate the possibilities
<br>
of financial ties between them (there was, at the time, no law requiring
<br>
that politicians disclose campaign contributors) to prove that the
<br>
so-called &quot;5th Estate&quot; was in fact a bought and paid for propaganda
<br>
organ of the Democratic Party. He had some over-zealous lieutenants (G
<br>
Gordon Liddy, et al) break into DNC headquarters to find information
<br>
about such ties, as well as any other dirt that was on paper there
<br>
(including, it seems, a scheme by which the DNC supplied prostitutes to
<br>
wealthy male contributors). They got caught, Nixon tried to cover it up,
<br>
and got exposed as trying to cover it up when a White House staffer told
<br>
Woodward and Bernstein (sp?) of the Washington Post about a list of the
<br>
members of the black ops crew and that there were audio tapes of Oval
<br>
Office conversations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the &quot;war on drugs&quot;?  I'm surprised nobody has called our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occupation in Afghanistan part of the &quot;war on drugs&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.drugtext.org/articles/ial5.html">http://www.drugtext.org/articles/ial5.html</a>
</em><br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we're bitter because the heroin money from Afghanistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ran out, after what we gave them in aid against the Soviets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so we're sending in our muscle to &quot;collect what's owed to us&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>The Afghanistan situation has far more to do with oil politics than
<br>
heroin politics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We sell armaments and train militia in other countries just so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can go there and expend our military budget.  Sound unreasonable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our government does it.
</em><br>
<p>Our government does it, as do many other countries. It's a done thing.
<br>
As President Carter learned, the world doesn't magically get better when
<br>
the US starts acting more puritanical. We play the dirty game because
<br>
many far less moral and ethical countries do so for the purpose of
<br>
damaging the US, and we are stupid to not fight back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1915.  1969-1970.  1968-1974.  1979.  It goes on ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While we all strive for physical and intellectual evolution, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes you think that politicans have changed much in the past 200
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years?
</em><br>
<p>What makes you think that the US is acting ANY worse than most other
<br>
countries?
