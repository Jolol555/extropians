</em><br>
<p>Eliezer,
<br>
<p>This is one problem I have had with your published material.  When I have
<br>
asked AI experts at IBM to look at your stuff, they have no idea what you
<br>
are talking about.  You have invented your own concepts and terminology from
<br>
scratch and are not in-step with the rest of the AI community.  Although
<br>
this is not necessarily a bad thing, it does make it difficult to evaluate
<br>
your work.  Most of the experts who look at your website and published stuff
<br>
just shrug their shoulders and walk away.  I have not gotten any meaningful
<br>
evaluation from anyone.  If experts can't figure out what you are doing, I
<br>
don't see how the lay-transhumanists can figure it out.  I think that
<br>
documenting and sharing your ideas is probably your biggest problem with
<br>
getting funding or interest from other groups.
<br>
<p>I would like to learn more about what you are doing, but it looks like I
<br>
will have to do it on my own and learn your language and concept from
<br>
scratch.  It will not be possible to get assistance from other experts in
<br>
the field.  It is very difficult to understand something where peer review,
<br>
common terminology, and cross referencing is not available.  What do you
<br>
think of this situation?  At the Extro-5 conference, you mentioned to me
<br>
that you are too busy to document your stuff to train new people to give you
<br>
more time so you won't be too busy anymore.  I know that you probably have
<br>
thought about this problem extensively.  I think Anders is exactly right,
<br>
that this problem faces many of our projects.  We must get peer-review,
<br>
public availability, and common ground, or we will be resigned to work by
<br>
ourselves in our individual basements.
