The Dallas Morning News, Letters To The Editor, 1 January 2001
<br>
By Joseph Adebola (Irving, Texas)
<br>
<p>I am a Nigerian visiting friends here in the Dallas area and I have really
<br>
enjoyed reading copies of your fine newspaper.  It is very refreshing to
<br>
find someone like Franklin Graham who understands the problems regarding
<br>
Islam.  (&quot;A Christian can respect Muslims but reject teachings,&quot;
<br>
Viewpoints, Dec. 16).
<br>
<p>Muslims today seem to only strongly support freedom of religion in places
<br>
where they are a small minority, like here in the United States.  But once
<br>
they become a majority, they usually fight to replace existing
<br>
constitutional laws with Islamic law through extremely violent means
<br>
including repression, enslavement, and murder of non-Muslims.  This is
<br>
going on now in many places including Nigeria where thousands have been
<br>
killed in 2001 in areas dominated by Muslims.
<br>
<p>Action speaks louder than words.  Take the actions of many Muslims in
<br>
Nigeria: women't rights, extreme religious intolerance, attempts to impose
<br>
medieval style punishment systems (stoning, amputations), closure of coed
<br>
schools, and promotion of polygamy with Muslim men marrying up to four
<br>
wives.  This shows Islam is a religion whose practices are often stuck in
<br>
the dark ages.
<br>
<p>The United States' Founding Fathers were men with great foresight who
<br>
recognized the dangers of mixing religion and government.  They wisely
<br>
wrote in the Constitution &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an
<br>
establishment of religion, nor prohibit the free exercise there-of&quot;.  The
<br>
sad part is many &quot;moderate&quot; Muslims see nothing wrong with imposing Islamic
<br>
law and statehood on entire populations of people of different faiths.
<br>
<p>The solution?  Respect for universal individual freedom of religion.  Any
<br>
human being anywhere in the world should be able to worship his or her God
<br>
without interference from any government.  If freedom of religion is good
<br>
for Muslims in the United States, then it should be equally good, and made
<br>
available for everyone else, Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide.  The world
<br>
will be a much better place when there is no more Islamic state, Christian
<br>
state, or any government devoted to any religion.
<br>
