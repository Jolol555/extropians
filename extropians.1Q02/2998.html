<em>&gt;Subject: AGING: perhaps we are over the hump

<br>
<em>&gt;So I'm curious...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Who wants to join the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and is willing to walk their talk?
</em><br>

<p>Interesting idea, I'd be surprised if it hasn't come up on the list before.
<br>
<p>I'm wondering whether multiple independent investments would be the way to 
<br>
go, or contributions to a single fund.  Wouldn't the larger fund grow more 
<br>
quickly, given the bigger initial sum?
<br>
<p>Would this bring up a whole mess of problems regarding multiple investors, 
<br>
such as trust, who has rights of access, death of investors etc. etc..?
<br>
<p>We could call it the Extropian OAP fund :)
<br>

&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
