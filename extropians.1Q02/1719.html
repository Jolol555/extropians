<p>Yep, I'm pretty sure Sigma sells it.
<br>

</em><br>
<p>If you want to keep your enzymes for long that is what
<br>
is people suggest.  I'm unsure if its &quot;strictly&quot;
<br>
required.  An alternative is an LN2 dewar but you
<br>
have to keep it topped off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; c) Sterilizer: $1000-$15000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alcohol won't do?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe.  Combine it with a good long cook in the
<br>
microwave and that would be better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; d) Incubator: $2000-$5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 grand for a heater!?  are you serious?  any disadvantage in using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;use a lamp&quot; method i read somewhere on the net?
</em><br>
<p>My microbiology lab used big cabinets with temperature
<br>
controlled lamps, so that will clearly work.  But if you
<br>
want to do cell culture you have to control the CO2 level
<br>
so you need something more sophisticated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; e) Centrifuge(s): $1000-$7000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, i assume for isolating ribosomes, you'd want tens of thousands of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirement?  wouldn't a souped up fan spun for a long time do? (only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half kidding)
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, I've never tried it.  Perhaps a hacked CD-ROM drive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; f) PCR apparatus: $2000-$4000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the cheap side, i was thinking of using manpower: 95C tub, 60C tub,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 72C tub, move eppendorfs from one to the other when you think it's

</em><br>
<em>&gt; lego mindstorms, get it to do it for you.
</em><br>
<p>ROTFL.  Boy that is a throwback approach, but it would probably work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; g) Hood: $3000+
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, is it really necessary? (as opposed to, say, fan pointing out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; window)
</em><br>
<p>The problem is RNA and DNA contamination.  You (and all the microorganisms
<br>
in the air) are leaving traces all over the place.  If you want good
<br>
results you are going to need to avoid contamination.  You might be
<br>
able to get away with a hand constructed one, a blower and a UV lamp
<br>
in it for sterilization when you aren't using it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I know it would be a very dodgy setup, but would it be good enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolate prokaryotic dna, cut it up and gel it? what about eukaryotic? 
</em><br>
<p>Prokaryotic probably.  Eukaryotic its going to depend on whether you
<br>
have a large sample to start with, are going to PCR amplify it or
<br>
need to isolate it from cultures.  In that case you need to deal
<br>
with the CO2 incubator issue.
