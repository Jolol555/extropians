<br>
&quot;Question #3: What are the potential consequences of women and men
<br>
fighting alongside one another? 
<br>
<p>Answer: Combat is a team activity which brings people closer together
<br>
than any other profession. A small number of women may possess the
<br>
physical and mental toughness to perform some combat duties; but
<br>
teamwork matters more than individual capabilities in combat, and this
<br>
teamwork generally is undermined by the presence of women. On one
<br>
support ship during Operation Desert Storm, 36 of the 360 women on board
<br>
-- ten percent -- became pregnant. (Alecia Swasy, &quot;Shipboard Pregnancies
<br>
Force the Manly Navy to Cope With Moms,&quot; The Wall Street Journal,
<br>
October 3, 1991, p. 1.) In a Roper survey conducted during the Gulf War,
<br>
64 percent of military personnel surveyed reported that sexual activity
<br>
had taken place in their unit. (The Roper Organization, &quot;Attitudes
<br>
Regarding the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces: The Military
<br>
Perspective,&quot; September 1992.) Mixing men and women in military units
<br>
invites sexual attraction and special relationships, and these
<br>
relationships -- or even the perception that they exist -- destroy the
<br>
morale and cohesion which any fighting force must have to win wars. If
<br>
more women join combat units that become open to them as a result of the
<br>
Administration's new policies, this problem will only worsen. &quot;
<br>
<p>So, I will correct my earlier assertion about the actual quantity of
<br>
pregnancy copouts, but the fact that the rate was so high on at least
<br>
one ship and the rate of sexual activity between members was so high
<br>
(where said women were not generally in contact with their actual spouse
<br>
for a number of months prior to discovery of pregnancy) still lends
<br>
credence to the claim that at least some women will cop out of their
<br>
jobs when wartime occurs in order to get out of a combat zone.
<br>
<p>Now, it does take two to tango, as they say, and I recall that even in
<br>
the well segregated/chaperoned conditions of basic training when I went
<br>
through, at least a few female recruits managed to get pregnant in basic
<br>
training (and a few couples were caught, rather comically, 'hooking up'
<br>
in dumpsters, which says something about the effectiveness of putting
<br>
saltpeter in the drinking water).
<br>
<p>That some will cop out is evident, but one has to wonder about their
<br>
will, since the same paper talks about how training commanders
<br>
determined that only 1 percent of women can meet a standard of physical
<br>
fitness that 60 percent of men can meet, and that therefore it reduces
<br>
military effectiveness and increases training costs markedly to allow
<br>
women in the military:
<br>
<p>&quot;Only one woman out of 100 could meet a physical standard achieved by 60
<br>
out of 100 men. Gregor concluded that going through this process would
<br>
mean that &quot;I have just traded off 60 soldiers for the prospect of
<br>
getting one. The cost considerations are prohibitive.&quot; (Lt. Col. William
<br>
Gregor, USA, testimony before the Presidential Commission, September 12,
<br>
1992, cited in the Presidential Commission's Report to the President,
<br>
November 15, 1992, p. C-42.) &quot;
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it seems that more women in the military just don't have
<br>
the guts to take on combat roles:
<br>
<p>&quot;Question #4: How do women serving in the armed forces feel about being
<br>
assigned to combat units? 
<br>
<p>Answer: In a 1992 survey of Army women, between 70 and 80 percent of
<br>
respondents favored allowing women to volunteer for combat. Yet, among
<br>
the same respondents, 90 percent of female noncommissioned officers and
<br>
88 percent of enlisted women indicated that they would not volunteer;
<br>
only 14 percent of the Army officers surveyed indicated that they would
<br>
volunteer for combat assignments. And fully 52 percent of Army women
<br>
claimed they would leave the service if women are compelled to serve in
<br>
combat. (Laura Miller and Dr. Charles Moskos, &quot;1992 Survey on Gender in
<br>
the Military,&quot; Northwestern University, September 1992.) &quot;
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it seems that claims that barring women from combat
<br>
inhibits their career path is groundless:
<br>
<p>&quot;The charge that barring women from combat units inhibits their career
<br>
advancement is groundless. According to Department of Defense
<br>
statistics, even with the combat exclusion for women, the services are
<br>
promoting females at similar or faster rates than males. (Department of
<br>
Defense, &quot;Military Women in the Department of Defense,&quot; Volume VIII,
<br>
July 1990, pp. 30, 73.) Expanding combat &quot;opportunities&quot; places the
<br>
aspirations of feminist activists ahead of the wishes of most military
<br>
women, who have expressed consistently strong personal resistance to
<br>
being assigned to combat. &quot;
<br>
<p>Also, it seems that popular claims about the effectiveness of integrated
<br>
combat units are a myth:
<br>
<p>&quot;Question #5: What has been the experience of nations that have mixed
<br>
men and women in combat units? 
<br>
<p>Answer: History shows that the presence of women has had a devastating
<br>
impact on the effectiveness of men in battle. For example, it is a
<br>
common misperception that Israel allows women in combat units. In fact,
<br>
women have been barred from combat in Israel since 1950, when a review
<br>
of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War showed how harmful their presence could be.
<br>
The
<br>
study revealed that men tried to protect and assist women rather than
<br>
continue their attack. As a result, they not only put their own lives in
<br>
greater danger, but also jeopardized the survival of the entire unit.
<br>
The study further revealed that unit morale was damaged when men saw
<br>
women killed and maimed on the battlefield. (Presidential Commission on
<br>
the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, International Trip Report,
<br>
September 14-27, 1992.) &quot;
