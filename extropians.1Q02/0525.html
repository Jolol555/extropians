</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is that possible? Cute, imo.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this assumes that a) the God known as Yahweh/Jehovah/etc has
<br>
exclusive deitic franchise throughout the universe, that b) nobody else
<br>
has ever moonlighted or impersonated a god long enough to create a new
<br>
intelligent species of their own, that c) all intelligent species in the
<br>
Universe are as blinkingly stupid as we are that they need Exiles from
<br>
Eden, Floods and Arks, as well as first and second comings (as well as
<br>
cameo appearances by other prophets) before they finally get the point
<br>
like we did, that d) God has a far better record at beaming his only son
<br>
back upstairs without all that hassle of needing resurrection (if I were
<br>
Jesus I'd demand far better contract terms than whatever he had back
<br>
then. You could tell he was pissed that God was overdue off staring at
<br>
the Megellanic Cloud or something).
<br>
<p>My vision of aliens is far more akin to the Farklar race depicted in the
<br>
&quot;Starvin' Marvin In Space&quot; episode of South Park:
<br>
Christian missionary: &quot;We've come to teach you how Jesus died to save
<br>
your souls.&quot;
<br>
Farklar emissary: &quot;Yes, that's nice, thank you very much, good bye.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey
<br>
&quot;Everything is Farklar&quot;
