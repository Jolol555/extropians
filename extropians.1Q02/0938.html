The *central meme of transhumanism* (i.e. “it’s right to use technology to 
<br>
go beyond Homo Sapiens”) has left the nest and is up for adoption by any 
<br>
ideological side. This can only accelerate as technological progress makes 
<br>
transhumanist goals possible.
<br>
<p>That’s what happens to good memes… they have a mind of their own and care 
<br>
little of what their “parents” think is good for them.
<br>
<p>Anders’ vision of transhumanism is totally agreeable, but it is only a 
<br>
humanist’s  interpretion of that “central meme of transhumanism”, in the 
<br>
same way that extropy is a libertarian’s interpretation of it - to put it 
<br>
brutally!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems to me that the best way of reconciling the differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between the different views is to recognize transhumanism as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meta-ideology, not attempting to prescribe all aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political ideology but providing an underlying set of values and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assumptions.
</em><br>
<p>“Meta-ideology” is the correct description of transhumanism in my opinion 
<br>
too, but I don’t think it’s possible to prescribe “underlying sets of values 
<br>
and assumptions” anymore than it is to “prescribe all aspects of political 
<br>
ideology”.
<br>
<p>Trying to bolt-on humanism (or any other ism) on what I called the “central 
<br>
meme of transhumanism” can indeed succeed in creating a movement that 
<br>
combines the &quot;ism&quot; in question and the &quot;central meme of transhumanism&quot;, but 
<br>
it cannot prevent unsavoury ideological sides from carrying out the same 
<br>
operation, because a nazist/communist/racist/etc could just adopt that 
<br>
central meme and discard the rest (including the word &quot;transhumanism&quot; 
<br>
itself) without a second thought.
<br>
<p>We need to learn to let go of that &quot;central meme&quot; and concentrate instead on 
<br>
promoting our version of it (and stop pretending that ours is the only 
<br>
possible version).
<br>
<p>Finally, this (relative) ease of adoption of transhumanism’s “central meme” 
<br>
should not be seen as a weakness, quite the opposite in fact and I'll try to 
<br>
show why with an example.
<br>
<p>In Italy, where I come from originally, federalism is continually in the 
<br>
news these days. Twenty years ago it was very much a fringe subject, but 
<br>
today all political parties  describe themself as federalist, to some 
<br>
extent.
<br>
<p>As illustrated in an Italian newspaper's satirical vignette: 
<br>
man-in-the-street asks a politician: “Are you federalist?” “Of course!” 
<br>
answers the politician “…and I have been for over half an hour, now!”
<br>
<p>Replace federalist with (“central core”) transhumanist and, with a bit of 
<br>
luck, you could be looking into the world’s political situation of 2010.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
