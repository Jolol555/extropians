From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20&quot;Sound%20and%20Fury&quot;%20over%20enhancements">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I would regard somebody who, after hearing the pros and cons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being uplifted, said &quot;I'm not going to change&quot; as a rather extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.
</em><br>
<p>If changing resulted in increased extropy, then an obstinate refusal to change
<br>
could not accurately be described as extropian.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly more extropian than the instinctive &quot;Yech, I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *never* abandon the true way!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Since never abandoning the true way is equivalent to not changing, you have
<br>
contradicted yourself. You see, &quot;I'm not going to change&quot; and &quot;I will never
<br>
abandon the true way&quot; both indicate a refusal to adapt. So, one is just as
<br>
anti-extropian as the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - which is just as unextropian as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who doesn't care to hear about the demands of self-augmentation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and just respons with a &quot;Yay! Uplift me *now*!&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, being deaf (as we were saying), they couldn't hear about such
<br>
demands.
<br>
So, as I was saying, the most unextropic thing one can do is to choose to
<br>
remain deaf (which means willful ignorance of the world of sound), and that
<br>
means remaining deaf to the benefits of uplifting. That's what the old saw
<br>
means:
<br>
&quot;There are none so deaf as those who will not hear.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
