<p><em>&gt; Can anyone explain the difference, if any, between an operation per

</em><br>
<p>It depends on the nature of the hardware.  As Dan indicated, &quot;FLOP&quot;
<br>
which stands for floating point operation per second has a pretty
<br>
standard definition.  The design of most floating point units usually
<br>
allowed the ADD, SUB and MULT operations to be carried out in the
<br>
same period of time.  This used to be in 1 clock cycle, though I think in
<br>
most CPUs today they take several cycles.  DIV typically took a bit
<br>
longer.  I don't know if anyone ever designed a floating point unit
<br>
where they put enough hardware into it that the DIV executed in one
<br>
clock cycle as well (Google might know...).
<br>
<p>Now on the older hardware particularly the difference between an
<br>
instruction per second and a (Floating) &quot;operation per second&quot;
<br>
was significant.  On PDP-11's the clock cycle time was 300 ns
<br>
and that was how long it took for most integer instructions
<br>
(int-ADD, SUB, MOV, etc.).  So if you were just executing integer
<br>
code, you could get 1/3 MIPS out of the CPU.  Floating point
<br>
operations took several cycles, so you usually got more like
<br>
less than 1/6 MFLOPS.  So &quot;IPS&quot; were not generally equal to &quot;FLOPS&quot;.
<br>
On modern CPUs I think there is enough floating point hardware
<br>
and the CPUs are so pipelined that I think the difference is
<br>
less pronounced.
<br>
<p>Now &quot;calculations per second&quot; gets into the nature of the machine.
<br>
For general purpose computers, its just IPS or FLOPS, but in
<br>
special purpose computers it is more complex.
<br>
<p>Chesire I think asked what a GRAPE was -- that a special purpose
<br>
&quot;GRAvity PipelinE&quot; computer that was designed by a group in Japan
<br>
to do just the gravity calculation.  It did the calculation in hardware
<br>
and was massively parallel, There have now been 5 or 6 generations of them,
<br>
with each generation being faster.  It is used to simulate things like dust
<br>
clouds collapsing into stars, billions of stars collapsing into galaxies,
<br>
two galaxies colliding with each other, etc.  Since the fundamental execution
<br>
unit is the entire gravity calculation (I'm unsure of how many MULTs/ADDs/EXP, etc.
<br>
this is) -- comparison between GRAPEs would be measured in GrvtyCalcsPS.
<br>
However, I think they generally figured out how many FLOPS this was
<br>
equivalent to and so they &quot;rated&quot; GRAPES like other computers (GFLOPS &amp; TFLOPS).
<br>
For most of the last decade they've been the most powerful computers on
<br>
the planet in terms of raw throughput (though for a very special
<br>
application).
