</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Why would you assume that? It does not follow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry.  Glad I was explicit about what I thought you meant.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assumed it because, in my world view, it is not the responsibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of companies to ensure that &quot;people below a certain intelligence and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of training&quot; are employable.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to believe that it's a collective responsibility, so I groped for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an interpretation of something that didn't make sense to me otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I believe it is a responsibility of people to make the world 
<br>
such as they would wish to live in.  Whatever groupings they do 
<br>
that from within is less of a concern.  I don't think the world 
<br>
we want is one where advancing technology can simply make us and 
<br>
our wealth accumulated to date irrelevant and where that means 
<br>
that we cannot survive and take part in what we helped bring 
<br>
about as we aren't economically viable contributors any longer. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the type of world we (or a lot of us) do want and 
<br>
expect then let us be clear about that.  Just waving our hands 
<br>
and saying it will never come to that seems inadequate.  I have 
<br>
no reason to believe it cannnot come to that given current 
<br>
economic/sociological models expressed partially on the list. 
<br>
So I ask what people think of this possibility and what they 
<br>
wish to be the shape of the world they inhabit in this respect. 
<br>
How we shape the world to what we wish is a question for later on.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;One of the charities I give to (as I've mentioned before) is Trickle Up. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This is commendable. But the question remains of what happens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;when these measures prove inadequate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People do something about it.  You keep implying that you think the right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer is &quot;People force other people to do something about it&quot;, but you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disclaim any actual plan.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I actually said nothing at all of the kind.  I simply asked the 
<br>
questions that I believe must be answered if we are to envision 
<br>
what kind of world we wish to acheive and our place within it. 
<br>
Doing so is required if we are to have a reasonable chance of 
<br>
creating such a world.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What of those others who have no aunts and uncles, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;parents or other benefactors in such a position and with such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;generosity? Are we to say it is ok to lose those minds, minds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that may have been of great benefit?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said (immediately following the sentence you reacted to) that I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that everyone should be allowed to deduct contributions for education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given to anyone.  I won't get any tax advantage for contributing to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nieces and nephews, so I'm only willing to do it for relatives.  If it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax deductible, many people and companies would give a lot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>And I do agree that this is a good idea.  It is one I have 
<br>
advocated for some time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;The best the government could do would be to allow any tax payer to take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;deduction for any contribution to anyone's education. Doesn't matter whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the student is related or not. Same for corporations. More education is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;for all of us, but making it an entitlement is bad for all of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I don't agree it is bad for all of us. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, we'll have to disagree about that.  I believe making it something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone can demand and the rest have to pay for (including poor people who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay taxes--remember that it's not just the rich that pay taxes) is wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, that departs a bit from the question itself into the realm 
<br>
of who pays taxes (or other means of contributing to such needs) 
<br>
and how much different parties pay.  But ok.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;As these things go it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;one of the few entitlements that I believe makes sense. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I believed in entitlements, I might agree with you.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't believe in entitlements as commonly conceived but I do 
<br>
believe that in a rich culture citizens should be able to take 
<br>
for granted much more than that they can work for everything 
<br>
they get in fundamental realms like education.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I would limit it in that those who take advantage of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it must keep certain academic standards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will be far easier for me to impose standards on my neices and nephews 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than for the government to impose any standards.  This is an aside about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency and effectiveness, not about morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>You may have a point there when the &quot;standards&quot; become a 
<br>
political football with accusations of the standard being biased 
<br>
for and against certain groups, being &quot;elitist&quot; and all the rest 
<br>
of the garbage.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;No. I am unhappy because I personally know a great number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;bright minds that are wasted and I recognize they are the tip of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the iceberg.  [...] So I am not awfully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;impressed when I see fine graphs saying everything is getting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;better. I do not personally believe it. I don't have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;statistics to back it up but my gut says something is damn fishy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  If personal experience is more convincing than statistics, whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the source, I'll stop here.  Simon's statistics summarize the experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of far more people than you or I could ever talk to.  They abstract out a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of personal defeats and successes, but they're the best evidence we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have about the real effects of real policies in the real world over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Simon's statistics can be countered with other statistics and we 
<br>
can have a jolly time for quite a while arguing about the merits 
<br>
and demerits of various sources and even wading into the wilds 
<br>
of statistical theory.  Many statistics are based on more people 
<br>
than you or I talk to but they don't all agree with one another 
<br>
by any means.  At bottom, even in the elite sphere, my personal 
<br>
take is things are not so rosy as Simon usually paints them.
