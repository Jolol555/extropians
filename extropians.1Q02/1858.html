From: &quot;Chen Yixiong, Eric&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cyixiong@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Quest%20for%20the%20Purpose%20of%20Life">cyixiong@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; 1) we still remain alive (or why don't we all just die?)
</em><br>
<p>We are dying, duh. There's no such thing as immortality yet. If you're
<br>
asking why don't we want to commit suicide, homocide, genocide, etc., it's
<br>
because we're too busy trying to live, generally speaking of course.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 1.1) since we have so many problems, why don't we just wipe everyone out
</em><br>
to solve all these problems?
<br>
<p>Because then we'd be dead. Unless you intend to stay alive yourself of
<br>
course, but I bet you'd find you would have more problems afterwards,
<br>
generally speaking.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 2) why we seek progress
</em><br>
<p>So we can live longer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3) why we insist on certain things such as freedom
</em><br>
<p>So we can enjoy life.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Can someone explain how:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) we develop ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) we derive our goals (such as freedom for all)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) we can assume that sentient AI would seek self-preservation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) we can consider such decisions with great implications such as nanotech
</em><br>
and the singularity if we don't consider  the purpose of
<br>
<em>&gt; life question
</em><br>
<p>Are you asking for reasons to explain your listed observations, or are you
<br>
setting each one of these as a goal and asking how to achieve them?
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps someone else here can contribute more questions instead of only
</em><br>
answers. I hope this will result in a serious and fruitful
<br>
<em>&gt; debate and consideration of our meta-goals or lack of them.
</em><br>
<p>It's very hard to not sound glib answering these questions. Why ask why? How
<br>
do we ask ourselves? Why do we answer? Who is we? The list of waffling
<br>
questions can go on and on, and I'm sorry to say that I feel that your
<br>
questions instigate and contribute to this waffling, strange loops in
<br>
reasoning, quotes and misquotes, and chaos.
<br>
<p><p>Obviously the intent of you asking these questions is very serious, which is
<br>
appreciated in a community such as this. But my opinion is if you want
<br>
serious answers, then ask the question(s) seriously, being specific, and
<br>
preferably one question per conversation thread to start with.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
