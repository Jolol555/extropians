<p>I just saw it this afternoon, and found it deeply moving and thought provoking.  It brought me hard up
<br>
against several questions that trouble me, and I suspect, will be serious for transhumanism.  For
<br>
starters, there is the question of what makes a mind stable in the first place?  As usual, if it were
<br>
not for the stories of the pathological cases, we would take far more for granted.
<br>
<p>How do you control your own mind?  If you start enhancing the power of your mind to show you new
<br>
things, you run the risk of not being able to stop it from doing so all the time.  In order to get on
<br>
with life, I have to keep a damper on all the things I could think about.  Upon walking out of the
<br>
theater, I turned that off for a short time and just let it rip.
<br>
<p>Some video games have become so consuming to some players that the term &quot;digital crack&quot; has been
<br>
coined.  What if your brain is enhanced to the point that you can gen up even greater dream worlds for
<br>
your total immersion.  I have advocated the idea that after a sufficiently high level of intelligence
<br>
is reached, it becomes untestable because the subject would rather use the test for scratch paper for
<br>
his/her own musings.  What if at a further level paper is superfluous, and the subject just goes into
<br>
that internal world and does not come out?  The internal creations of a sufficiently enhanced mind may
<br>
be indistinguishable from reality (or what psychologists call consensus reality).
<br>
<p>And who is in there generating these movies for you to watch?  The question is strongly linked to the
<br>
identity questions we ponder on this list.  If you have enough extra neurons (or nanomachine neuron
<br>
additions/replacements) doing nothing at the moment, a self propagating pattern of excitation may arise
<br>
on you and blurt out something like &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot; sticking you with a moral dilemma over the
<br>
justification of getting rid of it (that is, if you can).
<br>
<p>The best part for me was the basic idea that one might use the logical part of one's mind to work
<br>
around problems elsewhere.  I will be thinking about this, and was very glad to learn the story of John
<br>
Nash (even if somewhat fictionalized) because it puts things in perspective.  I am reminded of the old
<br>
saying:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I despaired of my poor shoes, until I met a man with no feet.&quot;
