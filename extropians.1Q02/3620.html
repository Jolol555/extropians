<em>&gt; No wealth: Counsellor Troi and Captain Picard have both boasted about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the accumulation of wealth is no longer an incentive. What they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain is why. Humans have always been territorial (and so have our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary ancestors), so our desire to accumulate more assets seems
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; like a basic facet of human nature than a temporary cultural phenomenon.
</em><br>
It
<br>
<em>&gt; can be suppressed or modified through education and social conditioning,
</em><br>
but
<br>
<em>&gt; such methods are hardly 100% effective. Some greedy people should remain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not in Star Trek. So if humans in the future no longer desire wealth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then why not? Do they use extremely advanced brainwashing techniques, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated that no one can resist them? Or have they made the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulation of wealth illegal, as Marx advocated? The latter seems more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible.
</em><br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;No, it doesn't. The advent of replicator technology has
<br>
eliminated the
<br>
drive for fulfillment of basic needs through labor. Furthermore, the
<br>
federation citizens you generally only see in TNG are Starfleet
<br>
officers, trained at Starfleet Academy. These are scientists whose every
<br>
need is supplied by Starfleet from the moment of their induction. If
<br>
they need personal items, they are replicated, so the concept of 'cost'
<br>
for personal items and consumables is obsolete.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------
<br>
<p>He makes a good argument on the site that the replicators require a feed
<br>
stock (some sort of raw materials) since in numerous episodes they state
<br>
that many compounds are too complex to synthesize.  Which would still place
<br>
high value on those materials that could not be replicated, never mind the
<br>
exhorbitant cost in energy to replicate them (unless the majority of matter
<br>
comes from feedstock) In either case, TOS also had replicators on board, yet
<br>
they seemed to still have a market based economy.  
<br>
<p>Here are his comments about replicators with quotes from each episode
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Database/TNG-Replicators.html">http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Database/TNG-Replicators.html</a>
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;However, it is far more telling to watch the future life of
<br>
the TNG
<br>
teleport officer, who is a non-commissioned officer, who worked his way
<br>
up through the ranks, and later works at Deep Space Nine, where we see
<br>
his wife and child on a regular basis.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>The author of this particular site focuses mainly on ST:TNG.  Perhaps many
<br>
other bits of evidence surface in later series, like DS9 and Voyager, which
<br>
contradict what was observed in TNG, or suggest that the federation has
<br>
changed somewhat since then.  
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;Now, you may claim: but any world that joins the Federation
<br>
must adopt
<br>
communism. This claim is directly contradicted by the Prime Directive.
<br>
Individual worlds are free to develop as they wish.&quot;
<br>
<p>The prime directive, as far as I can tell, usually applies to pre-warp
<br>
societies.  Afterwards the federations approaches them and asks if they want
<br>
to join, then they must conform to the federation rules to get membership.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ma Bell is back: The entire subspace relay system is owned by the
</em><br>
Federation
<br>
<em>&gt; government, as described in the DS9 tech manual. There is no private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitor. Since all interstellar communications must use this relay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network, this effectively gives the Federation government total control
</em><br>
over
<br>
<em>&gt; long distance communications. Furthermore, it appears that local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications systems are government-operated as well, since the
</em><br>
government
<br>
<em>&gt; was able to effortlessly impose a complete local news blackout during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempted coup in &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; As another monopolistic Microsoftian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure, all communications start and end with the ubiquitous Federation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logo, even on mixed civilian/military stations like DS9. Quark once ran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afoul of this monopoly when he wanted to broadcast advertisements for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bar, and had no alternative but to break into DS9's communications system.
</em><br>
<p>Deep Space Nine is located in Bajoran space, which is treated as a DMZ
<br>
or UN Protectorate equivalent following the Cardassian War. Furthermore,
<br>
it is a station that is owned by the Federation, so it is obvious that
<br>
they would control their own communications systems. You only see the
<br>
federation logo on comm screens because the only comm screens you ever
<br>
see are federation owned screens.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;Now, lets say that God has either been proven to be
<br>
non-existent, or
<br>
else federation technology has allowed private individuals to have a
<br>
direct comm line with the universes sysop. In either case, chapels would
<br>
be unnecessary, but what, exactly, does this have to do with capitalism?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------
<br>
<p>I think its more the fact that the TNG stayed away from any religious
<br>
implications of any kind in the federation (probably cause the writeres
<br>
didnt know how to handle it and paramount didnt want to offend anyone) yet
<br>
most every alien race encountered has a religion.  In the federation, it
<br>
seems to be strangely absent (with the exception of Picard's brothers
<br>
comments apparently)  I think the lack of a god has a lot to do with
<br>
communism (not capitalism) as marx said 'religion is the opiate of the
<br>
masses'  If the author is arguing that the federation is communist, it seems
<br>
a good line of evidentary support to show the lack of religions in the
<br>
federation, since communist nations typically avoid or actively persecute
<br>
religions.  Whether you agree with the authors conclusions or not, its hard
<br>
for me to imagine that you didnt see why he used that piece of evidence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey - &quot;There are many incidents in Star Trek history of
</em><br>
businessmen
<br>
<em>&gt; operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; openly, even if some are depicted in a rather typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biased-Roddenberry fashion (Harry Mudd, of &quot;Troubles with Tribbles&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other episodes of ST:TOS featuring him, including the one with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beauty pills and dilithium miners, and the one where Harry meets his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent end at the hands of an android that appears as his ex wife....)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      --------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you check the site out, he starts off (at some point) by saying that
</em><br>
TOE
<br>
<em>&gt; was mostly a free enterprise system, and joked that there must have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of coup in the intervening years.
</em><br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;Note that replicators did not exist in the TOE period, but
<br>
did exist in
<br>
the TNG era, supporting my theory.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Replicators werent in the original series?  What were those little
<br>
cubbyholes that they would walk up to, say something, a door slides open,
<br>
and out comes food.  Is there a kitchen back there?  Or was I hallucinating?
<br>
They had transportors, why not replicators?
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey - &quot;This is inaccurate. Note how farms in Japan still use
<br>
primitive hand
<br>
labor, hand polishing apples while still on the tree, etc and as a
<br>
result command a far higher market price than mass produced American
<br>
products, even of the same species. Note that 'authentic' french
<br>
champagne produced using traditional methods commands higher prices than
<br>
mass produced American &quot;champagne&quot; which is produced by the same method,
<br>
but automated, though is not allowed to be called 'champagne'. Note also
<br>
the organic farming movement, which commands higher prices for its
<br>
produce than non'organic' produce.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I certainly wouldnt go so far as to say it is 'innacurate' as it is merely a
<br>
different interpreation of an observed phenomena,  Fact, they have a low
<br>
tech hand worked farm.  Explanation, could be in a memory or throw back to
<br>
the 'old days' in a communist society, or it could be a high priced organic
<br>
farm for technophobes.  Why is your interpretation more correct then his?
<br>
There is not any more evidence to suggest either explanation more clearly,
<br>
with the exception of the rest of the anecdotal evidence from the series,
<br>
which you interpret as being evidence of a free market society, and he
<br>
interprets as being evidence of a communist one (at least in TNG)  Seems
<br>
that to determine which explanation is a simpler one for the observed facts
<br>
you should take the debate up with him, as you (as he) seems (IMHO) to have
<br>
some good points.
<br>
<p>In either case, you should probably not be arguing with me about it as A) I
<br>
am not the author of the site and B) not a very big star trek fan.  Perhaps
<br>
you can email the author, he seems to be very rational and scientifically
<br>
minded and enjoys intelligent debates.  Id like to see the discussion if you
<br>
do...
<br>
<p>Regards
