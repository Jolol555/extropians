Found this interesting piece on a research project in India to use rare
<br>
earth hydrites to store hydrogen densely at room temperature in
<br>
transportation applications:
<br>
<p>Novel way to store hydrogen;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.timesofindia.com/articleshow.asp?catkey=-2128672765&amp;art_id=1931735608&amp;sType=1">http://www.timesofindia.com/articleshow.asp?catkey=-2128672765&amp;art_id=1931735608&amp;sType=1</a>Ìš<br>
<p>EW DELHI: Indian scientists have come up with a potentially
<br>
revolutionary fuel technology packing hydrogen at room temperature in
<br>
cubes which can be recharged. 
<br>
<p>Last week, researchers from a multi-disciplinary team of Benaras Hindu
<br>
University ran a hydrogen-powered Hero Honda motorcycle for hours before
<br>
senior executives from the Indian Oil Corporation and Oil and Natural
<br>
Gas Corporation. They also ran a portable genset and a cooking range on
<br>
their cutting-edge technology. 
<br>
<p>Sounds like a lot of gas? Or another case of herbal petrol? Not at
<br>
all. I put 30 years of my reputation at stake when I recommended this
<br>
technology to the Planning Commission, says former National Physical
<br>
Laboratory director A R Verma. 
<br>
<p>And Verma is not alone. So excited are the energy giants IOC and ONGC
<br>
that they have expressed a willingness to fund the BHU team. We are
<br>
convinced of the viability of the technology and will support further
<br>
research, said IOCs research and development director A K Bhatnagar,
<br>
after the January 9 demonstration at his Faridabad R&amp;D centre.
<br>
<p>The star attraction at the demonstration was a rectangular box fitted
<br>
under the seat of the motorbike. This packed enough fuel for the 100 cc
<br>
bike to run a 50-km stretch. A recharge takes six minutes.
<br>
<p>The BHU technology traps the gas in molecular form in hydrites  a
<br>
mixture of powdered rare earth metals found in abundance in Orissa,
<br>
Kerala and Assam. 
<br>
<p>Between minus 12 and 80 degree Centigrade, the hydrites absorb hydrogen,
<br>
only to release an adequate stream beyond a certain temperature. The
<br>
fuel box has been calibrated to release the hydrogen at the temperature
<br>
generated by the exhaust. 
<br>
<p>And enough gas remains in the fuel line to kick the engine into life. In
<br>
case of a crash, the powder just withers, without releasing a burst of
<br>
fuel to explode, as is the case in conventionally fuelled vehicles. 
<br>
<p>This is the first time in the world that two-wheelers are being run on
<br>
hydrogen, said O N Srivastava, who heads the 10-year-old BHU research
<br>
programme. His team had been running six motorcycles using these
<br>
portable hydrogen boxes for some months now.
<br>
<p>The fuel box weighs 17 kg, or twice that of a tank with 10 litres of
<br>
petrol. We are trying to halve it and increase the range to 100-150
<br>
km, said Srivastava. He said the engine had been modified but declined
<br>
to give details. A number of overseas organisations are after us, he
<br>
said. The team has patented some of the technology in India and is
<br>
moving for a global patent.
<br>
<p>So far, global research on hydrogen has centred around fuel cell
<br>
technology. Broadly, this means using hydrogen to produce electricity
<br>
through a process that is the opposite of electrolysis. 
<br>
<p>This is unviable in the Indian context. For example, a hydrogen car
<br>
built by Chrysler would cost around Rs 3 crore here. Besides, the
<br>
technology is elaborate, suitable for defence and space applications,
<br>
Srivastava said.
<br>
<p>The options of storing and using hydrogen so far have been either as
<br>
gas, which is dangerous, or liquid, which is expensive, Verma said. Both
<br>
need cryogenic technology.
