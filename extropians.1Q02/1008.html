<p>Did you pay for your account?  Most companies I have worked for do not
<br>
provide technical support to the people who use the free versions of
<br>
their products.  They view those more as advertising which will lead
<br>
to people eventually being willing to pay.
<br>
<p>Of course even a free product is not good advertising if it does not work.
<br>
I personally have a free Hush account (although I've never used it for
<br>
much) and got through the 2.0 transition OK.  So I guess the software
<br>
is not 100% broken.  Perhaps your account got corrupted in the transition.
