<p>The discount depends largely on the quantity you buy the raw materials in.
<br>
Agar and polyacrylimide are just expensive reagents as far as I could tell
<br>
over the few years I was paying for them in fairly large quantities.  You
<br>
also have to deal with your anticipated reagent consumption rate as some
<br>
of the materials have limited shelf lives.

<p>Measure twice, cut once dude!  :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously though, there are a number of ways to lower costs.  One is
<br>
to make friends with a scientist in Russia or China.  You can probably
<br>
get the reagents made by firms within those countries sent to them, then
<br>
reshiped to you and pay significantly less.  Quality does become a
<br>
concern however (though the problems present in the mid-'90s have
<br>
probably improved significantly).  I think at one time some 20-30%
<br>
of the enzymes being sold by NEB were actually manufactured in Russia.
<br>
<p>There are some hefty costs you are missing when you attempt to scale
<br>
from a simple microbiology lab to a molecular biology lab.
<br>
a) Water purification: $3000-5000
<br>
b) -80 deg freezer: $3000-5000
<br>
c) Sterilizer: $1000-$15000
<br>
d) Incubator: $2000-$5000
<br>
e) Centrifuge(s): $1000-$7000
<br>
f) PCR apparatus: $2000-$4000
<br>
f) Microscope: $400+
<br>
g) Hood: $3000+
<br>
<p>Of course the high end prices are for more serious work.  But I'd
<br>
guess for serious molecular biology work the minimum entry costs
<br>
are probably $30-40K. It would be interesting to see what the
<br>
lowest costs would be and how you might make compromises.  A google on
<br>
&quot;high school molecular biology lab&quot; might turn up some interesting ideas.
<br>
<p>The unfortunate part of this is that although I think things like
<br>
lab-on-a-chip could decrease your operating scale and therefore lower
<br>
experimental costs, I don't really see trends that will decrease
<br>
the minimum entry costs anytime soon.
<br>
<p>I just checked and tucked away in the back of my refrigerator is
<br>
a rack of tubes from the organisms I was working with 10-11 years
<br>
ago.  I don't know how good they are though since I lost the
<br>
compressor for a month at one point.  But you never know,
<br>
microorganisms are pretty hardy.  Of course, the problem with
<br>
being a &quot;closet microbiologist&quot; is the inevitable question
<br>
that comes up on your 2nd or 3rd date when the woman opens
<br>
your refrigerator and says &quot;What are those????&quot; in a squeaky
<br>
tone of voice.  I suppose I should put a piece of paper
<br>
on them with a skull &amp; crossbones and big letters &quot;Don't Touch!&quot;
<br>
just to make it more interesting.
