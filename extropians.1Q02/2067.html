<p>Well, there was an interesting bit on the most recent episode of &quot;Law &amp;
<br>
Order&quot;, where a child witnessing a heinous crime imagines that they
<br>
dreamt about it before it happened, the shrink analysing the kid says
<br>
that this &quot;Omen formation&quot; is a typical coping mechanism that kids have
<br>
to exert a semblance of solipsistic control over the world around them.
<br>
I'd posit that the need to have 'purpose' is a similar sort of coping
<br>
mechanism, where the brain manufactures a 'purpose' to explain why
<br>
things happen as they do and why the individual exists in this world.
<br>
<p>Imagining ourselves as a simulation created by occupants of some other
<br>
universe could also be explained as such a 'purpose' coping mechanism,
<br>
tranferring responsibility for the bad things that happen to these
<br>
mysterious others (and simultaneously absolving ourselves of guilt for
<br>
our own sins, since we &quot;don't really exist&quot;, it doesn't really matter
<br>
what we do, good or bad (as demonstrated by Dinofrio's character in The
<br>
13th Floor)).
<br>
<p>This is a classic coping mechanism employed by statists throughout
<br>
history to absolve populations of their responsibility for the actions
<br>
of their leaders. Libertarians and Extropians should not fall prey to
<br>
this fallacy (as even I myself have done).
<br>
<p>Accepting that the universe has no meaning, no purpose, other than to
<br>
tick along under the rule of physical law, is likely the hardest truth
<br>
for a person to accept in their lives, because it heaps on the
<br>
individual the total responsibility for their own worth, action, and
<br>
impact on the world around them.
<br>
<p>Physical law remains the only objective truth of existense, and thus
<br>
truth only exists as it is derived and abstracted from physical law. We
<br>
serve no truth greater than the universe, no purpose outside what we
<br>
ourselves strive to be within the constraints of physical law.
