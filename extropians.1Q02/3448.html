</em><br>
<em>&gt;This doesn't have to overlap with a particular political or socioeconomic

</em><br>
<em>&gt;(see the taxes thing again).
</em><br>
<p><p>How do you get a critical mass of people in to the game if you can't make 
<br>
it fun or economically beneficial without that critical mass?  Sounds like 
<br>
a chicken and egg problem.  Unless you go with the sex idea - no problem 
<br>
getting people in on that basis, I would guess.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I would like Reason to detail how the Everquest people are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; black-market economics in the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The EQ dictatorship (Verant), with the cooperation of the US and EU legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems, forbids the trading of EQ intangibles for real world money. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some cooperation in suppression from real world marketplaces (such as eBay).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Therefore all such markets are black markets; you are breaking real world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contracts (and possibly laws) and EQ laws if you do this.
</em><br>
<p><p>But is anybody doing this?  And if so, how?  And how do you know?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; See my reply to Reason on Hakim Bey's (Peter Lamborn Wilson) &quot;T.A.Z.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Temporary Autonomous Zones) - a similar concept.  I wonder if Wilson has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considered MMORPGs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;URLs? Google uncharacteristically gives me a bunch of junk commentaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than original sources.
</em><br>
<p><p>Don't have any URLs.  This is underground sort of literature - anarchist 
<br>
stuff that shows up only in certain catalogs like Loompanics or Last Gasp 
<br>
of San Francisco.  Do a search on Autonomedia - I think they publish his stuff.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; The problems with Reason's notion that the game could be designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; support a lib development is simply that the game rules can be subverted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hacked, or - if irritating enough to enough people - simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abandoned.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more the game must approximate the real world, the less likely the game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world can control real-world behavior *in* in the game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;True, and that's the goal to be aiming for. There's nothing wrong with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subverting or abandoning rules if the populance of the virtual nation want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do it. Goes on all the time in existing games, and it's just another part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the cultural complexity.
</em><br>
<p><p>But how do you keep the game going as you want it to if no one is playing 
<br>
by the rules?  What distinguishes the game from being the real 
<br>
world?  Where is the benefit of playing a virtual world if in fact it is 
<br>
indistinguishable from the real world?  I'm having trouble understanding 
<br>
your point.  On the one hand, you suggest creating a game that supports a 
<br>
lib viewpoint, on the other hand you say if doesn't matter if the players 
<br>
ignore that viewpoint and act against it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;My original point was not to control people's behavior; I'm very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against that. It's to provide a place to start over with a new nation (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slew of new nations), which can prehaps prompt people into seeing that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are other, better ways to run a society beyond the one that has been settled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on in the meat world today. If they then want to abandon that and recreate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big, invasive governements as virtual nations then so be it. But in theory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are enough libertarians in the world to populate a libertarian virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nation; such would arise in the natural give and take of virtual nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ecology once the concept goes mainstream. And if the claims about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laissez-faire capitalism are right, said nation should wind up very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influential.
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;In theory there are enough libs.&quot;  I'm not sure.  And I really doubt there 
<br>
are enough libs - let alone Transhumanists - to provide several hundred 
<br>
thousand or several million members of a given VN enough to provide real 
<br>
economic benefits to the players let alone clout in the real world.  I 
<br>
think you are much too optimistic on the numbers.  On the other hand, if 
<br>
you abandon the lib VN concept, one could create a VN with large numbers of 
<br>
players IF there was a hook (such as sex) to draw them in in the first place.
<br>
<p>The Libertarian Party has been trying for thirty years to build its 
<br>
strength.  They have probably no more than 30,000 members - out of a 
<br>
national population of 300 million.  And it took them thirty years to build 
<br>
that - an average of 1,000 members a year.  And these are relatively hard 
<br>
core libs.  You'll never get 300,000 libs into a VN at that rate.
<br>
<p>If you drop the political stance, however, the question arises:  what will 
<br>
the VN look like?  (I do need to research the existing MMORPGs, I suppose, 
<br>
if I can find the time.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree with you that it need to be more than just &quot;fun&quot;.  But &quot;fun&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shouldn't be ignored.  How about a game where sex and its pursuit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfaction was a factor.  THAT might bring in a LOT of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and be VERY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; profitable - and influential as well in altering attitudes.  That would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attract state oppression, of course, but the state's inability to control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the 15 million or so porn sites bodes ill for their suppressing a virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Sex World&quot; - especially if the system were as distributed as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is and more so using encryption, peer-to-peer technology, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This game is being played right now on dating sites the world over. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't need to put this into a game; it just happens. The same goes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything else; economics, social hierarchies, politics, sex -- it will all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fit itself into any space in which more than three people are talking on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regular basis. All the designers of the gamespace have to do is not get in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the way.
</em><br>
<p><p>If sex - or anything else - doesn't need to be put in the game, then what's 
<br>
the point of the game?  I'm trying to pin down what this game is supposed 
<br>
to do besides waste time in imaginary pursuits.  On the one hand, you 
<br>
suggest all sorts of benefits - on the other, you say these things already 
<br>
go on without the game.  So why play the game?
