<p><em>&gt;I think Harvey has an interesting point with that immortality may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not immediately become a hit. If there is some cost or trouble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved (like a training regimen, or keeping a sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dynamic mind) it may take quite a while even for immortality to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become popular. We tend to think of longevity and immortality as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the best things possible, but these views are not universally held
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and often people (us included!) value short-term rewards over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long-term rewards of longevity. This might contribute to a gradual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spread of superlongevity rather than everybody getting it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quickly as possible. 
</em><br>
<p>When I talk to people about our ideas I always seem to get the same
<br>
responses.
<br>
<p>When I talk about longevity people always seem to equate getting
<br>
old with getting sick/feeble. When I postulate &quot;what if you could
<br>
be the equivalent of 35?&quot; then they are skeptical, but very
<br>
interested.
<br>
<p>Yes it does mean a regimen, from eating right, taking proper
<br>
supplements to spending days in the gym. But the rewards are worth
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>I just had an idea, what about establishing an Extropian Longevity
<br>
Protocol? It could encompass not only physical and mental health
<br>
but the required economic advice as well.
<br>
<p>I have a reoccurring dream where we start this by opening a chain
<br>
of Extropy health clubs...
