Marriage is not a right, its a privilege
<br>
&quot;Marriage is a privilege belonging to persons as  members of society&quot;

<br>

: I am further delighted to see these issues dealt with at the

<br>
: 
<br>
: Of those states that decided acknowledge transgender
<br>

<br>
: what stage of gender transformation does the person become
<br>
: the target gender?  Whenever they say?  Does a doctor need
<br>
: to declare the transformation more than halfway done?  Can
<br>
: it be *any* doctor, including one who is him/herself
<br>
: transgender?  Or what about a case like my cousin, born
<br>
: ambiguously gender raised male, who married an ambiguous
<br>
: gender raised female?  And what if a transgender male to
<br>

<br>

<br>
: It will bring me much joy and laughter to read the body of law
