</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think you should be careful here. There is a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between the interned and the deaf, and that is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former very likely regarded their internment as something not having any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bearing on their identity (unless some of them got a really serious case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Stockholm Syndrome), while the deaf - like many disabled people -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often include the property of being deaf into their self-image. So when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somebody suggests a cure it is not just an issue of getting better, but
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; tactfully, and we transhumanists ought to remember the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morphological freedom is a *negative* right: we also have the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain unchanged.
</em><br>
<p>This is where a phenomenon like Stockholm Syndrome is involved: the deaf
<br>
person is handicapped by deafness to such a degree that they derive
<br>
their identity from that which imprisons them rather than themselves.
<br>
This is why those who are born deaf adhere so much more to 'deaf
<br>
culture' than those who lose their hearing later in life. Those who were
<br>
previously hearing already have a sense of identity, and deafness is not
<br>
part of it, and they resent their deafness.
<br>
<p>An internee in a POW or Internment camp is similarly less likely to
<br>
identify themselves with their oppressors if they had a strong sense of
<br>
identity before imprisonment, however over time this does break down
<br>
everyone, as is evidenced by criminals in civilian prisons for many
<br>
decades, they become so institutionalized that they are unable to
<br>
function in the outside world. They all eventually define themselves by
<br>
the walls and bars and other restraints around them.
<br>
<p>Deafness is simply a wall between the deaf person and the normal hearing
<br>
world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This illustrates that cultures, in and of themselves, have no rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are figments of individual humans imaginations in order to survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the circumstances they are put in at the time. To seek to remain in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suboptimal cultures long after the circumstances that brought them about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are alleviated is simply a form of Stockholm Syndrome: introversion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indentification with the oppressor, and denial of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe, but when it comes to valuing one's state it is hard to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somebody is simply wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that trying to prevent the use of cochlear implants or impede
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their development in the name of a culture is wrong, but I don't see any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical right to impose them on unwilling subjects. The issue of young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children (which is really what this is about) is more tricky, since they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot truly give informed consent. Here I would apply my &quot;maximize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options principle&quot;: unless there is strong evidence that the implants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decrease their ability to participate in deaf or hearing culture, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is better to have more abilities and hence options, so the implant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a good. I still don't think this makes it obligatory or that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would clearly overrule parental objections, but as a doctor I would take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my time arguing with the parents for getting the implant.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I agree with you here, and I watched the program on NHPTV last
<br>
night. The cochlear implant requires, it seems, an exterior transmitter
<br>
to function. Removing that transmitter, it seems, makes the person
<br>
temporarily deaf again. With that in mind, and keeping in mind that the
<br>
implant is best performed at a young age (the child implanted was about
<br>
a year old) to allow brain development of aural pathways, it is rather
<br>
obvious that a compromise can be reached.
<br>
<p>I'm thinking of two things: a) how Amish society, which oppresses the
<br>
use of advanced technologies by its members, does provide every young
<br>
member a span of years to life in the &quot;English&quot; world and decide for
<br>
themselves if they wish to remain Amish, and b) how many immigrant
<br>
families both require that their children learn english AND speak their
<br>
native tongue at home.
<br>
<p>Therefore, all deaf children receive cochlear implants and undergo
<br>
speech therapy to ensure that they keep up in normal schools with their
<br>
speaking peers (its a fact that the average deaf persons reading
<br>
development at the end of high school is only at a fourth grade level)
<br>
but that a deaf family would also have the child remove the external
<br>
transmitter while at home, to ensure that they learn and participate in
<br>
deaf culture. As an adult, the grown up child can decide for themselves
<br>
the degree of their own participation in the deaf and hearing worlds.
