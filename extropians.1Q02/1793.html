<p>Apparently you missed the incident when Alcor changed the insurance policy
<br>
for customers outside the U.S. You can read it up on Cryonet.
<br>
<p>If you're in the U.S. things are a lot more consistent. I still suggest
<br>
you follow Natasha's advice and make contact to people familiar with the
<br>
process. There are insurers which make much less hassle than others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; stick to the list.&quot;  What's up with that?  This sounds like you expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of bait-and-switch from Alcor.  Am I mis-reading this or is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As an European with marginal knowledge of the field my level of trust into
<br>
any provider (right now, there's only one provider worth mentioning:
<br>
Alcor) is not very high. Things are bound to become better in the next
<br>
decades, though.
