<em>&gt;&gt; Consider your average slum in the USA, government supplies the
</em><br>
schools,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; private enterprise supplies the automobiles. There are far more good
</em><br>
cars
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than good schools in that slum. Why do you suppose that's true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hm. Because good schooling costs more than good cars? Because people
</em><br>
invest
<br>
<em>&gt; more in good cars than in good schooling? Because the amount invested
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; the government for schools is less than people want to spend on their
</em><br>
cars?
<br>
<em>&gt; Because cars as broken as the public school system wouldn't drive at
</em><br>
all?
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, why do you think that these two variables are related?
</em><br>
<p>Where I live in the US, New Jersey, the state government spends on
<br>
average approximately $11,000 per year per pupil.  How much does the
<br>
average American in New Jersey spend on cars per year?  I bet it's much
<br>
lower than that.  The method of supporting public schools is forced
<br>
payments from tax-payers.  There is thus a disconnect between the buyer
<br>
of educational services (the tax payers) and the consumers of them.
<br>
That being the case, costs are not as big an influence on spending in
<br>
the system.  Car buying, on the whole, combines costs and benefits and
<br>
is usually funded privately.  Also, since the government chooses how to
<br>
run the school system and not the consumer of that system (despite
<br>
voting -- which, again, comes down to voice vs. exit options*) we should
<br>
expect increasing costs and declining quality in education with respect
<br>
to cars.  In fact, this does seem to be exactly what we see.
<br>
<p>(Of course, education does take longer and the results are not as
<br>
immediately noticeable as in a car purchase, but there are still
<br>
measurable results in education -- even if they are more difficult to
<br>
implement and track.  Part of this, too, might be the result -- no pun
<br>
intended -- of not having a market system of education.  In a free
<br>
market, no doubt, easy measures would arise.  I bet, under such a
<br>
system, _Consumer Reports_ might have an school issue devoted to
<br>
choosing the best schools.  Certainly, this goes on at the college level
<br>
and for private schools as they exist now.)
<br>

<br>
<p>* The distinction coms from Myron Lieberman's 1989 book _Privatization
<br>
and Educational Choice_.  A voice option is where the party to a
<br>
relationship can improve the relationship only through some internal
<br>
mechanism of complaint or communication.  In this context, voting,
<br>
attending board of education meetings, and lobbying politicians are the
<br>
main methods of changing the public education system open to parents.
<br>
An exit option is where a party to a relationship can leave the
<br>
relationship.  Almost every market transaction fits this paradigm and
<br>
quite a few other types of relationships, such as marriage, friendship,
<br>
family, and even membership in most organizations (political parties,
<br>
churches, the Extropy Institute).  Does anyone doubt that the exit
<br>
option is much more powerful in changing relationships?  Even the
<br>
implicit threat of it makes other parties involved in such relationships
<br>
more amenable to change and makes such relationships more dynamic.
