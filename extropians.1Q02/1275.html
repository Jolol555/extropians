<em>&gt; You should worry seriously about radiation dosage.  Many of these

</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be putting yourself in for unhealthy doses of radition just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy your curiosity.  Is the benefit worth the risk?  Has anyone done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies?  
</em><br>
<p>There is no scientific evidence (that I am aware of) to justify recommending
<br>
whole body CT screening for patients with no symptoms or a family history
<br>
suggesting disease. There is no evidence that whole body CT scanning is
<br>
effective in terms of reducing total health care costs; nor that it is
<br>
useful in prolonging life.
<br>
<p>In addition to their specific risks, screening procedures with low
<br>
specificity (like CT) can also expose patients to the risks of further
<br>
diagnostic investigations after a false-positive finding.
<br>
<p>The risks of radiation are well researched but (as you might expect) highly
<br>
controversial. Sticking to dose limits, here's the current UK guidelines:
<br>
<p>1. for employees aged 18 years or over, 20 millisieverts in a calendar year
<br>
2. for trainees, 6 millisieverts in a calendar year; and
<br>
3. for any other person, including members of the public and employees under
<br>
18 who cannot be classed as trainees, 1 millisievert in a calendar year.
<br>
<p>These are the limits for healthy employees and the general public (obviously
<br>
not patients, who may require a diagnostic investigation due to disease).
<br>
Environmental exposure to radiation is around 3mSv/annum but can rise (e.g.
<br>
in Cornwall, where there is a lot of granite, it can be around 10mSv/annum).
<br>
Finally, some occupational groups (e.g. aircrew) get significantly higher
<br>
dosages. 
<br>
<p>To put this in the context of CT, a typical CT scan of the chest gives a
<br>
radiation dose of 8mSv which is equivalent to 400 chest radiographs (chest
<br>
radiography = 0.02 mSv) and a high resolution CT scan of chest by
<br>
conventional scanner (thin slices, high mA) gives a dose of more than 600
<br>
chest radiographs. Whole body CT will obviously be a lot more.
<br>
<p>What this means in terms of risk is less clear, but it will be greater than
<br>
zero... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Granted, if these were low risk and low cost, I would not mind having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them done.  I wonder about ultrasound in this area.  You might not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to spot the same things as other types of scan, but it seems less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risky.  If the risk is only 1% of other scans and the benefit is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% as much as ditto, that would still be 10 times more benefit over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk.)
</em><br>
<p>MRI is another non-invasive technique with low risk. I suspect that the
<br>
problem is not the risk of the procedure, but the sensitivity and
<br>
specificity of the test for diagnosing potentially life threatening
<br>
problems. If the test has low sensitivity, it will not be useful as a
<br>
screening tool (as lots of stuff will be missed). If it has low specificity,
<br>
it will expose large numbers of people to unncessary and potentially harmful
<br>
further investigation for false positives.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Geraint
