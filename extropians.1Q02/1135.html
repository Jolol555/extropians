<p><p>There are a few militaries in the world that have units that work exactly

like that.  In practice, this seems to work out MUCH better than the

segregated forms, and both the men and women got used to a perfectly gender
<br>
and orientation neutral military relatively quickly.  The women in those
<br>
units could clean the clocks of the women in the US military, as they were
<br>
every bit the equal of their male counterparts in most things.  With all due
<br>
respect, and I may get flamed for this, most women in the US military are
<br>
dead weight and would be better off removed.  But I'd serve with the women
<br>
in those foreign units any day.  There are still some noticeable differences
<br>
between men and women in the military (mostly cognitive), but most of the
<br>
issues people complain about with respect to women in the military service
<br>
vanish when the military becomes truly gender blind.
<br>
<p>I wish I could remember what the foreign unit was that we worked with that
<br>
was integrated like that.
<br>

<p><p>This is an honest assessment.  I wish it wasn't the case, but it is.
