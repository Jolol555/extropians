This is Peter and me doing point-counterpoint.  Peter's statements have an odd
<br>
number of indentations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A society in which a large fraction of rewards go to a handful of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is a society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; which a large number of people take big risks to become one of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; handful, and it is a society in which most of the people who make that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt fail to achieve what they want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And who do they hurt when that happens?  And who benefits?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  They hurt mainly themselves. Whether others benefit depends very much on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nature of the competition.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [...]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  The extent to which people enjoy the pursuit is very dependent on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived chances of success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Competition to serve consumers or to serve voters produces incentives that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are better than the complete absence of those incentives or any alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which don't involve free markets, but there are plenty of costs associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with competition, and I think it is often possible to reduce the costs without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much effect on the benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  And not all competition is competition to serve people.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see anything to disagree with here.  Do you want to try further to
<br>
convince me that competition is mostly bad?  Or that &quot;we&quot; should do something
<br>
about it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's why life is so much better for everyone, including the worst off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  We can easily observe that some people are worse off than they were 10 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 years ago, by observing the efforts they make to avoid changes. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not disputing that there are short term ups and downs.  Is there something
<br>
we (or the government) should do differently because of that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know of any method of similar reliability that would enable us to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what fraction of people are better off than they would have been centuries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago, but I suspect that many aristocrats of previous centuries would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer to have been born in this century.
</em><br>
<p>Is there any need to nail down the fraction precisely in order to say that
<br>
it's true in general?  Do you disagree that it's true in general?
<br>
<p>I can easily imagine aristocrats that would feel that way, but it seems to me
<br>
that the reason is largely that they had power over people as they were, not
<br>
that they were relatively wealthy to what they'd have here.  
<br>
<p>Perhaps if we require that those aristocrats consider the possibilities from
<br>
behind Rawls' &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;
<br>
(<a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/o/origposi.htm">http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/o/origposi.htm</a>) they'd agree that people are
<br>
better off, even though the aristocrats (being in the aristocracy) had nowhere
<br>
to go but down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The average voter seems sufficiently uncertain about whether to treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job security as a property right that there is no objective answer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question of whether it currently is a property right.
</em><br>
<p>Fine.  I wouldn't have argued for an objective answer.  But it seemed clear to
<br>
me that most here (including you) would have agreed that people who know how
<br>
to make buggy whips don't lose anything objective (anything they should be
<br>
compensated for by the government or anything they should be able to sue for
<br>
in court) if they lose their jobs because buggy whips aren't in as much demand
<br>
this year as last.  [I intend to exclude unemployment insurance from that
<br>
statement.  It's mere happenstance as far as I'm concerned that insurance is
<br>
provided by the government.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It [...] seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a symptom of the belief that because free markets are better than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives, we should ignore problems associated with them.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe I've said that we should ignore such problems.  If anyone
<br>
believes that they've identified enough problems that we should consider
<br>
scrapping markets or meddling with them more (or even as much as we do) I'd
<br>
like to hear about it.  I think it's pretty clear that &quot;free markets are
<br>
better than the alternatives&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  That's why the arguments in Luxury Fever imply that there are negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; externalities associated with celebrity-worship. Since I don't see any way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to internalize those externalities, I therefore believe that a moral system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; which creates social pressure to make choices that reduce inequality will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; produce a nicer society than a moral system that claims inequality doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; matter. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I'll grant that there is something to this argument.  It doesn't seem like it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;makes the case for much more than subtle social pressure.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Social pressure is the only strategy that I am optimistic about. 
</em><br>
<p>That's fine.  I don't mind if you work on that.  I'm not bothered by the
<br>
negative externalities.  I think the positive externalities at least
<br>
compensate, broadly speaking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians, most of whom benefit from inequality of status and power, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce inequality rarely produces a genuine effort to produce more egalitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results. 
</em><br>
<p>I hope you weren't expecting me to defend politicians or the value of relying
<br>
on them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I think there are many political issues on which it ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence voter opinions. For example, I would guess that the duration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyright protection that would maximize material wealth would be about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4 years, but that to maximize what people actually value (i.e. adding in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the benefits of equality) would require a copyright duration of a year or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so less than that.
</em><br>
<p>That seems like a remarkably precise estimate.  Even if I assume that it's a
<br>
ballpark number, what's the argument that reducing copyright duration from 4
<br>
years to 3 (minus an &quot;or so&quot;) would significantly increase society's level of equality?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Convincing people that they don't need to be as rich as Croesus to be wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by any reasonable measure seems a fine meme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If by reasonable measure you mean measures that society ought to encourage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then yes. In the absence of social pressures, I doubt that a purely selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure would cause someone to loose interest in further wealth.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't want people to lose interest in further wealth.  If someone has
<br>
earned 10s of millions of dollars by satisfying some desire of other people, I
<br>
don't think we benefit by convincing her that she should stop doing so.  We
<br>
might arguably benefit by convincing her that she doesn't need to earn 100 or
<br>
1000 times what her employees do in order to tell that she's still
<br>
contributing something valuable.
