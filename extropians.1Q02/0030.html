</em><br>
<p>That doesn't jive with what you wrote before, or perhaps it's just
<br>
Americans who should die in silence.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Life is short and we have to pick our battles.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, many, if fact most of the wars America has fought in the last
<br>
200 years have been pointless, but not this one. If September 11 was
<br>
not a big enough deal to require action what is?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;it seems to imply it is the fault of the citizen if they happened to be in
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;the wrong place at the wrong time.
</em><br>
<p>I'll wager the ratio of innocent civilian death to guilty combatant deaths is
<br>
smaller than any major war in history, nevertheless I'm also sure some
<br>
very nice Afghani civilians died through no fault of their own. That sucks,
<br>
if I was God I would do things very differently but unfortunately I was not
<br>
given the job.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;It is also folly to equate not standing up to a murderously repressive regime
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;with failing to bug your congress critters at every possible opportunity.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with that.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The  danger of a large asteroid or comet slamming into the earth in
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;your lifetime are pretty tiny compared to many other more
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;immediate dangers.
</em><br>
<p>It's a different subject but the probability you will die next year because a
<br>
Mt Everest sized asteroid slams into the Earth are about the same as
<br>
the chance you will die in a airline crash. About one chance in 50 million
<br>
that 5 billion people will die, you do the math.
