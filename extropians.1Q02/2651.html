<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many shortcomings that are acting upon our ship of state 
<br>
like an ice accumulation upon a real ship.  I understand that if allowed to 
<br>
continue real ice can finally sink a real ship.  Certainly this one is 
<br>
slowing in its economic efficiency.  Let me give one example: I am a retired 
<br>
engineer in a specialty that has almost disappeared.  I decided to study 
<br>
accounting.  As I was exploring the various fields of accounting I took a 
<br>
class in tax accounting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a one class each semester in our local community college in 
<br>
tax accounting that has perhaps 25 or thirty students.  You can bet that 
<br>
every college, two or four years, around here has classes of equal or larger 
<br>
size.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you imagine the wasted manpower going into figuring tax bills?  
<br>
That is purely a waste.  It is just more ice accumulating upon the ship of 
<br>
state.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is what would you do about it?  Oh, and what is a 
<br>
crypto fascist?  I haven't heard the answer to that one yet.
<br>
