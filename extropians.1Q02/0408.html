<em>&gt; But... I was never 100% behind the anarchist program -- I'd argue for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with more statist friends, then come here and play arch-conservative or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toy with quasi-socialist ideas as an exercise.  But ignore the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialism.  These days anarchy and even minarchy seem naive.
</em><br>
<p>I have similiar thoughts too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But an anarchy can't necessarily respond to invasion or selfish people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying the ozone layer with CFCs either.
</em><br>
<p>This shows that a core assumption of anacho-capitalism, that people acting for their own selfish interests will necessary cause the
<br>
society to operate efficiently, does not have validity. Adam's Invisible Hand sounds good, but the real world does have problems
<br>
that this ghostly hand can never reach.
<br>
<p><p>I suspect that many so-called Libertarians believe in anacho-capitalism not out of reason but more of out of religious fervor. They
<br>
like to quote the bible that renowned priests the neo-classical and Austrian economists wrote, claiming such truths as &quot;you can't
<br>
outsmart the free market&quot;.
<br>
<p>When I question their viewpoints they think of me as unworthy to challenge their supreme Gods and Goddesses (some of them seem to
<br>
&quot;worship&quot; Ayn Rand). Some even call me an agent of the Devil (i.e. communism). They believe that they can find freedom only in
<br>
Heaven (i.e. anacho-capitalist societies), and declare all other proposed places &quot;Hell&quot;. When asked what the &quot;angels&quot; do in heaven,
<br>
they still can't give me a definite answer except perhaps playing harps (i.e. enjoying their freedom, accumulating processions in
<br>
general).
<br>
<p>The wield thing lies with their persistent claims that they follow the basic principles of science. It makes me wonder to no end why
<br>
they would deliberately confine themselves to such memes if they really believed in keeping an open mind, as true scientists ought
<br>
to do. It makes me feel even more queer when experiment after experiment fails to prove their hypothesizes. Finally, they make
<br>
assumptions about the economy but call them facts when others question them. What kind of scientist would do such things?!
<br>
<p><p>I hope no extropians will fall for such intellectually seductive traps. We have more important things to achieve than to entertain
<br>
such religious memes.
