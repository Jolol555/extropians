<p>
There are several problems with basing a currency on &quot;energy&quot;.  First,
<br>
energy is not all the same.  Some forms of energy are more valuable
<br>
than others.  Although different forms of energy can be interconverted,
<br>
because of conversion efficiencies they can have different values.
<br>
<p>But more importantly, any currency based on a commodity like energy or
<br>
matter is subject to devaluation due to technological change.  One of
<br>
the primary purposes of money is to act as a store of value.  If you base
<br>
money on energy, and then we discover a new and cheap source of energy,
<br>
your money will suddenly have lost value compared to other things you
<br>
might want to buy.  The same thing could happen if you base it on gold
<br>
or any other rare form of matter.  In a nanotech era, carbon atoms may
<br>
become more valuable than gold atoms.  Tying your money to one commodity
<br>
is going to make it a highly uncertain store of value.
<br>
<p>Personally I think there is something to be said for fiat currencies in a
<br>
competitive environment, which is exactly what we have now.  I hope that
<br>
eventually it will become practical for people to use other currencies
<br>
than their native one in commerce.  I would like a choice of American
<br>
dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen, etc.  This form of competition will
<br>
encourage each monetary authority to act responsibly, otherwise their
<br>
currency will be devalued and their operations will become more costly.
<br>
<p>Competitive note issue has been analyzed in Bruce Benson's &quot;The Theory
<br>
of Free Banking&quot;.  Benson shows that allowing banks to issue their own
<br>
competing currencies produces a system which is very stable against the
<br>
threat of inflation while automatically adjusting the money supply.
<br>
While it seems unlikely that private note issue will be permitted
<br>
in today's regulatory environment, I believe that many of the same
<br>
conclusions apply in the international realm, where the various national
<br>
currencies compete with each other.  Increasing the range of transactions
<br>
where there is a choice of currency to be used should further increase
<br>
the financial discipline and stability predicted by Benson's theories.
<br>
<p>An interesting alternative form of money is Wei Dai's b-money system,
<br>
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/bmoney.txt">http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/bmoney.txt</a>.  It's almost too simple to
<br>
describe; in principle it is just a matter of everyone keeping track of
<br>
how much money everyone else has.  Whenever there is a transfer of money,
<br>
this fact gets broadcast and everyone updates their databases.
<br>
<p>B-money doesn't rely on scarcity of any commodity, or discipline on the
<br>
part of a money issuer.  Rather, the collective behavior of the entire
<br>
society produces a consensus definition of how much each person has.
<br>
This gives the system a great deal of stability, resilience and fault
<br>
tolerance.
<br>
<p>The b-money concept demonstrates how simple money can be.  It obviously
<br>
has practical problems in terms of global access to databases but there
<br>
might be environments in which the necessary conditions could be met.
<br>
<p>The important point in these conceptions of money is that it is
<br>
fundamentally a form of information.  B-money shows that most clearly.
<br>
Money is not about atoms, it is about bits.  Extropians should shun
<br>
old-fashioned views of money as based on material goods.
