<p><em>&gt; Here is where the ad hominen fallacy raises its head.  Usually it is

</em><br>
<p>In this case, it's a blessedly short read...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, I read the article, and while it is not badly written, in
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; his conclusion that Enron and the dot-com debacle disprove the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient market hypothesis,
</em><br>
<p>The EMH is questionable in itself, but that's really a topic for a very
<br>
long thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and that the Enron failure is largely due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government subsidies.
</em><br>
<p>Even so, it is true that Enron benefited heavily from government
<br>
intervention on its behalf in the market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that the story does illustrate groupthink among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalists and investors, but IMO that is not newsworthy analysis.
</em><br>
<p>For you, no.  For most people, it is news.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the core of the Enron story is and will be that the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entrusted with management defrauded the investors.  This is a constant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem in the capitalist world, at all scales.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is a feature of capitalism so much as it is a feature
<br>
of living in any type of society -- of living with other people period.
<br>
It's the problem of trust in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Each of us puts our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; savings into other people's hands, meaning that we have to trust them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And such trust is risky.  Every day people lose money because they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheated by people they trusted.
</em><br>
<p>See my Tuesday, January 22, 2002 10:43 PM post to this list where I
<br>
write:
<br>
<p>&quot;[L]ife is full of failures as well as successes.  This is especially
<br>
true in business and the stock market.  Everyone can't be right at the
<br>
same time in stocks (or commodities or futures), especially if each
<br>
investor is betting that she or he is right and everyone else is wrong.
<br>
That's why it might be a good idea not to stick your nest egg in your
<br>
company's stock options or even your company's 401(k).  Diversify and be
<br>
vigilant!  After all, it's your future you're playing with.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In business, the issue is whether the management truly represents the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests of the owners, the stockholders.  Every company is aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this risk.  The entire structure of the business firm is set up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to minimize this problem.  It's similar to cancer in an organism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where a part of the whole decides to advance its own interests at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expense of the larger body.  Biological organisms have defense in
</em><br>
depth
<br>
<em>&gt; against cancers, but sometimes those defenses fail.  In the same way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firms have all kinds of checks and balances to try to keep individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from enriching themselves at the expense of the business.  But these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't perfect either.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is where government intervention does play a role.
<br>
Government intervention in the financial markets, through controlling
<br>
credit and &quot;safeguarding&quot; investments, creates an atmosphere where
<br>
people don't develop strong mechanisms to deal with risk or weeding out
<br>
the good from the bad.  The story of the 1990s seems to be one of
<br>
repeated episodes of investors making risky investments without any
<br>
notion of the costs and then having the government bail them out when
<br>
they go sour -- as in Mexico, East Asia, Russia, with LTCM, and probably
<br>
next in Argentina and with Enron.
<br>
<p>This has setup the context in which an Enron can happen often and can
<br>
take many investors unawares.  (The real question is not so much why did
<br>
Enron collapse -- businesses go under all the time -- but why so many
<br>
people didn't see the warning signs.  Fraud too happens a lot, but, on
<br>
this scale, it seems to show that the government's intervention has
<br>
created a climate where investors are less likely to be skeptical, to
<br>
take a second look, or to try to reduce risk through well tested money
<br>
management practices.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the case of Enron, I believe the evidence indicates that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened, that the managers looked after their own interests rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those of the company's owners whose investments they were supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be protecting.  The use of complex financial structures defeated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checks and balances; no one could tell where the money was going, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was too tempting to direct it into their own pockets.
</em><br>
<p>The problem here is that such pyramiding schemes have happened before
<br>
and probably will happen again.  The fact is investors, especially
<br>
experienced ones, should have taken such complexities as a red flag.
<br>
(To be sure, some investors did and either stayed away from Enron or
<br>
treated it as a live one.  I forget the name of one analyst from Texas
<br>
who had almost none of his portfolio in Enron because he found the
<br>
nearly unreadable earnings statements to be such a warning sign.  He was
<br>
interviewed on NPR...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Enron, in fact, was killed by cancer.  (Technically it's not quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet; it is dying of cancer.)  It's newsworthy, because it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often to businesses at this scale.  But the real lesson is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to be aware of this new risk.  They need to make sure that their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managers are not in a position to cheat the company through the use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of complex financial instruments.  The use of derivatives and swaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be profitable, but unless there is effective auditing in place,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the business is risking its own life in using these instruments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Investors need to think of derivatives as carcinogenic stimulants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They produce short term benefits but can lead to long term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction.
</em><br>
<p>This is the same story as that of LTCM.  (See _When Genius Failed: The
<br>
Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management_ by Roger Lowenstein and
<br>
&quot;Too Big to Fail? Long-Term Capital Management and the Federal Reserve&quot;
<br>
by Kevin Dowd in his _Money and Markets_.)  However, this is just, as
<br>
I've said on this list, a variation on the theme of &quot;if it's too good to
<br>
be true, then it probably isn't true&quot; -- something investors, especially
<br>
small investors, have to keep in mind whenever they plan to put money in
<br>
any securities, be they stocks, bonds, or derivatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IMO the Enron bankruptcy does not show the need for more government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supervision, or fewer government subsidies, or most of the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessons people are trying to draw.  It shows the need for investors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more careful.  It shows a failure of one of the main limits against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corruption, the use of independenet auditors.  Investors will want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect themselves by insisting that their employees, the managers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hire auditors who have no financial incentive to cheat the investors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whom they are supposedly protecting.
</em><br>
<p>See my above self-quote.:)
<br>
<p>I do, however, think that, as I've also said above, government
<br>
interventions in the market have set the stage for failures like this --
<br>
i.e., of this magnitude and with this amount of surprise.  I'm not
<br>
saying under total laissez faire, no business will fail or that
<br>
sometimes investors won't be taken unawares, but I think under such a
<br>
system most investors would not take the same amount of risks or lose as
<br>
much because the information and incentives would be there to manage
<br>
risk better and to be prepared for big losses -- as opposed to expecting
<br>
the SEC to be omniscient and the Fed or Congress ever ready to bail out
<br>
any bad beats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These are the kinds of lessons which Enron teaches, and they are
</em><br>
exactly
<br>
<em>&gt; the kinds of lessons which the capitalist system excels at learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even without any regulatory changes, Enron will lead to a new
</em><br>
awareness
<br>
<em>&gt; of risk, and new techniques to manage it.  The end result will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system which is more robust and more able to fight the cancers which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constantly threaten business survival.
</em><br>
<p>I partly agree.  I think changes to the whole system need to be made,
<br>
but in the direction of less regulation so that systems to control risk
<br>
can spontaneously emerge -- and so that people who really don't have a
<br>
clue will stay out of the financial markets.  (How did I ride out the
<br>
stock market plummet of 2000 and 2001?  By having most of my funds out
<br>
of the stock market!  What is there is long term stuff that I don't (or
<br>
hopefully won't) need to touch right for years.  I did this while
<br>
friends of mine lost lots of money in their investments.  Of course, I
<br>
didn't make any big killings, but I haven't suffered any big losses
<br>
[yet] either.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
