<em>&gt; More seriously the problem of hunger is not really due to lack of food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production but rather lack of distribution and buying power among the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor. Even a cornucopia tree won't help if local warlords tax you 100%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at gunpoint. So the first step towards a solution to hunger may be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreading modified tree seeds (I think that is part of the *second*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step), but rather to spread satelite phones to make people able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate with each other outside local ruler's control.
</em><br>
<p>The existing GSM infrastructure is already doing this for regions in Asia.
<br>
Carriers are far less accountable to governments than they might be at this
<br>
time. Google for &quot;Estrada AND SMS&quot; for example to see what inexpensive
<br>
computers (=phase2+ cell phones @ $20 each) with simple short message
<br>
point-to-point communications can do to a society.
<br>
<p>You're finding that the people are being given a voice in countries such as
<br>
the Philippines, Indonesia, etc; their cell phones are allowing them to
<br>
publish and reach other people affordably where before they had no viable
<br>
and cost-effective way of doing so. Look at the mytext service from Smart
<br>
Comm in the Phillipines for example; it's a reimplementation of a
<br>
distributed bulletin board system for use by mobile phones via text message.
<br>
<p>[If you want to use an internet cafe in these countries, be prepared to
<br>
stand in line for three hours behind a horde of counterstrike players. And
<br>
pay outrageous sums of money].
<br>
<p>I think that the list's resident Singapore resident can probably speak to
<br>
the effects that cellphones have had on his citystate. I've spoken with some
<br>
of the companies based there (such as Edgematrix) in the process of my work,
<br>
and it's as much a high-tech hub and center of exciting social possibilities
<br>
as Northern California.
