<p>This is not true.  I remember a scene where Sisko is talking with the head of the Federation at the Earth headquarters.  And reminding him that despite the relative paradise within Federation space, that outside its borders there is a great deal of suffering and poverty!  
<br>
<p>you continue:
<br>
To proclaim this society as 'communist', and that
<br>
the Star Trek world is great *specifically because it is* would
<br>
therefore lend the dead concept of communism a level of credibility it
<br>
doesn't deserve... 
<br>

<p>As has been said before, it's clear that within the Federation one can find private enterprise flourishing.  And while this is a society where it appears everyone's basic needs for shelter, food, education and medical care are met by the state when necessary, still there is plenty of motivation to go out and  be successful in terms of career, status and finances.  So I definitely could not consider the Federation communist!  Perhaps to an extent they are socialist, but they have a level of technology which allows them to so indulge without a massive economic drain on the society.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
