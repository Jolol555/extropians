<p>The hijacker's could very well be bankrolled by the CIA.

<p><em>&gt; even more important because you give no coherent reason why the

</em><br>
<p>Boost a declining US economy before a true depression (which would
<br>
require a proper, full-scale war to emerge from, just like the
<br>
previous 2 depressions).
<br>
<p>OR
<br>
<p>To exercise more thorough control over the drug trade in Pakistan
<br>
and Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>OR
<br>
<p>To push surveillance and snooping technology and legislature
<br>
through in short order to use against groups that may pose a
<br>
threat to the current political powers.
<br>
<p><p>These are three reasons that have actually been used in the
<br>
past.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were the reasons behind
<br>
this event, as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and most important of all because nobody knows why you want to do such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thing as join this list.
</em><br>
<p>Because I agree with the extropian principles, mainly the notions
<br>
about continual self-improvement and life-enhancement through
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>Part of this is to ensure that the infrastructure (the environment
<br>
in which you live) can support these goals.  The government certainly
<br>
is a part of that.  Discussing the actions of our government (and
<br>
the sub-obvious goals of it) are most certainly relevant to
<br>
any organization which seeks to make major change in people's
<br>
way of life.
<br>
<p>Our government is reknowned for using it's superior force to
<br>
bring about an &quot;American&quot; way of life on people -- would it do
<br>
the same to it's very own people if they decided that they
<br>
preferred a different way of life?
