<p>Actually, I see the Singularity as the proper and original destination of
<br>
the technological run-away, which becomes fatally dangerous and unstoppable
<br>
only if we muff it.
<br>
<p>I don't necessarily see social/political goals as having zero value.  I do
<br>
know how wonderfully easy it is for people to redirect attention to
<br>
social/political goals.  There is a rational distribution of resources, and
<br>
there is such a thing as directing too much of your resources to
<br>
social/political goals.  So I tend to be very leery of people saying &quot;Ah,
<br>
but what about [social/political goal]?  Surely we haven't paid enough
<br>
attention to it.&quot;  I tend to regard that as either a public relations
<br>
tactic, or, even worse, genuine flawed thinking in which the goal of
<br>
altruism is self-satisfied warm fuzzy feelings rather than actual good
<br>
accomplished.
<br>
<p>If the above mode of thinking were sufficiently widespread, and were locally
<br>
executed without attention to globally emergent effectsthen I suppose that
<br>
social/political goals might some day become as underserved as the technical
<br>
side of the Singularity is now.  But that is rather unlikely while human
<br>
nature lasts.
