<p>Holes with some 10 g/s mass equivalent luminosity are not well described

in the literature.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; whole shebang look like hand-waving silliness. Probably I'm being

</em><br>
<p>Sure, Hawking blackbody emission max and total luminosity vs. hole mass
<br>
(the area of the event horizont is not an additional parameter in the
<br>
equation, right? it should be just the mass) should be easy enough to
<br>
derive and plot. Trying to predict the accretion in presence of such flux
<br>
even in pure hydrogen does not sound modellable with just the pocket
<br>
calculator.
<br>
<p>We're talking about homeostating a hole with few g/s mass loss via
<br>
gravitational accretion through a submicron orifice. In terms of
<br>
Joule-Thompson, luminosity of a few g/s material flux through a submicron
<br>
orifice is negligable. However, assuming above mass flow and fusable
<br>
substrate (protium, deuterium, tritium, maybe lithium) we should see
<br>
considerable fusion output in the accretion disk, adding luminosity to the
<br>
pure Hawking blackbody.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Actually, it would probably make sense to keep a 10 kK hole in an opaque
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sphere pressurized with hydrogen. What is the power output at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;blackbody maximum, about that of a nuke?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Main sequence stars balance radiation pressure with gravity. That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the above physical scenario looks like to me. Not a black hole.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the radiation pressure will be considerable, given that we're
<br>
talking about nuke luminosities in micron volumes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Black holes in real life suck in matter around it, which become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultra hot accretion disks.
</em><br>
<p>Compression in the accrection disk in this case seems negligable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You're the resident astrophysicist here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (who doesn't feel motivation these months to spend my limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-hours on science activities. I'm sorry about that, Eugene.)
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't of course expecting *you* to do my homework; god knows you're
<br>
busy. I was trolling for comments from other resident armchair physicists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have no idea if &quot;nano-sized black holes&quot; scale like star-sized or
</em><br>
<p>I haven't done the math, but I think it should be rather called a
<br>
microhole than a nanohole. Mea culpa.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; galactic-sized black holes (I'm not a black hole expert). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-collapse state would be pretty wierd for a nano-sized black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole, though. I'm not saying that it's not possible, but whoever is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposing it should have a  physically plausible description.
</em><br>
<p>It is weird. I think it requires nuke hydro code modelling to arrive at a
<br>
realistic description. The hole size might become prohibitively large to
<br>
reduce photonic pressure sufficiently, so that the total luminosity of a
<br>
single hole might become too low.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To power the energy output of a quasar (10^{47} erg/sec), assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an efficiency mass conversion via a swirling accretion disk of 10%,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would require swallowing more than 10 M_solar per year.
</em><br>
<p>We're talking roughly about a small to large nuke output of the entire
<br>
hole/accretion/fusion assembly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's useful to examine the density of the object becoming a black hole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a pre-collapse state (using Euclidean geometry), the mean density of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pre-black-hole object of mass M is: ~ ( 3 c^6 ) / (32 pi G^3 M^2).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [assumine a volume of a sphere, with R equal to the Schwarzschild radius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2GM/c^2]
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the equation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Would feeding the nanohole with dust at all make sense?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't read the beginning and intermediate posts regarding this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, Eugene, so I don't know the conditions. I would guess that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lifetime of the dust particle would not be very long though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you're immersing the dust in a high-energy shocked plasma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. the accretion disk around the black hole)
</em><br>
<p>I realized that the lifetime of a dust grain nearby a nuke is negligable.
<br>
I was thinking about attenuation of the Hawking and fusion output. One
<br>
might have to use high-velocity high-density (say, tungsten) pellets to
<br>
feed the hole instead of just relying on gravitation accretion of
<br>
hydrogen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Amara
</em><br>
<p>Thanks a lot for those references you ferreted out, despite being so busy.
<br>
Thanks again!
