Subject: Re: The Politics of Transhumanism
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; OK, I have waited a bit with my comments, because I have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awfully busy, and also interested in seeing what kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments would appear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, I think James has written an important paper. Not that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with it or its conclusions, but in that it is an attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start a transhumanist ideological discourse on a higher formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level. We need that to develop ideologically, since it both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides documents that can later be more easily referred to and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commented upon, and that it requires a broader view than just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current thread on the mailing list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My comments got a bit (!) longer than I intended, so I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divide this mail into a number of sections. An abstract:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I describe the roots of transhumanism in renaissance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightenment humanism, and discuss its relationship with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectivist &quot;transhumanism&quot; in the 20s and 30s. I also discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own experience of how the transhumanist environment has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed during the 90s. I then argue that transhumanism is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ideologically empty idea, but that inherent in it are strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanist values that resonate well with both libertarianism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal democracy. These values are however not consistent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectivism or fascism, and not tied to technology per se.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally I discuss the need for transhumanism as a movement to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify its core ideology and begin developing it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Contents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. The roots of transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. What is transhumanism really about?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.1 Transhumanism across the 90's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.2 Core values of transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.3 Critique of collectivist transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.4 What ideologies are compatible with transhumanism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.5 The problem with a technology identified transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. What should transhumanism as a movement strive towards?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. The roots of transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James' paper claims that contemporary transhumanism is based in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarcho-capitalist thought. I would say, given some views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed on this list and encountered in society, that one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as well claim it has technocrat communist roots. In fact, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is likely more important to get away from those roots than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The paper begins with the history of ExI, and this produces the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression that ExI really *is* modern transhumanism. While the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence of Max, Natasha, T.O. Morrow and all the other founders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thinkers linked to ExI is beyond doubt, they did not start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in a vacuum with their ideas. Later in the paper FM 2030 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledged, and further back even more remote historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources. I think this approach creates the mistaken impression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that transhumanism is something very recent and with shallow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree this is a major flaw with the paper. As an aside I should note that
<br>
James presented this paper as part of a panel at a Science and Technology
<br>
convention with Nick Bostrom and myself. (Nick's paper was &quot;Transhumanists'
<br>
Values) My paper was entitled &quot;Transhumanism as Platonism&quot; which should give
<br>
you some idea of how far back we can trace some of the ideas here.
<br>
<em>&gt; But the true origin of transhumanism can be traced back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renaissance humanists. Mirandola's triumphant _Oration on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dignity of Man_ expresses the transhumanist project admirably:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
snip snip
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; While the renaissance humanists were more concerned with issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human freedom and dignity than the possibility of immortality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or morphological freedom, there is no contradiction here and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian Manning Delaney pointed out at TransVision 2001 they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely have embraced it. They in turn drew on the Aristotelian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas of eudaimonia, the life of excellence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
As I have suggested on this list previously, I understand Transhumanism to
<br>
be the conjunction of the following:
<br>
1.  The Means Thesis: Within a hundred years humanity will possess the
<br>
technology to reengineer Homo sapiens.
<br>
<p>2.      The Ideal Thesis: The goal in the remaking task is to perfect
<br>
ourselves.
<br>
<p>3.      The Ethical Thesis: We ought to employ this means to realize this
<br>
ideal.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism holds 2 and 3 with much of the tradition of the West--all the
<br>
way back to Plato and Aristotle. What distinguishes Transhumanism 1, but
<br>
this does not mean that 2 and 3 are optional. I spell out this argument in
<br>
&quot;What is Transhumanism?, Why is a Transhumanist?
<br>
<a href="http://www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm">http://www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm</a> and &quot;Absolute versus Human
<br>
Perfectionism&quot; <a href="http://www.markalanwalker.com/abso.htm">http://www.markalanwalker.com/abso.htm</a>  Much of the history
<br>
of the West is a battle over what should be the means thesis. Plato,
<br>
Aristotle, Hegel, etc., thought that he means to overcome our human
<br>
limitations was through philosophical reflection. The Enlightenment (which
<br>
still has strands operating today) sees science as the means for overcoming
<br>
our human limitations. (A favorite metaphor is that with science we will
<br>
understand nature the book of nature and thus the mind of God--a metaphor
<br>
employed by Galileo and Hawking). The Romantics (particularly Sturm und
<br>
Drang) saw art as the vehicle for emancipation from our human limitations. I
<br>
am thinking of Schelling, Holderlin etc. When transhumanists advocate
<br>
technology as opposed to something else as the means thesis I think it is
<br>
important to see this as one minor variation on an ancient theme.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; After the renaissance these ideas of human freedom, potential and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dignity became central for the enlightenment. Technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress was still mainly seen as separate from (but helpful to)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human progress, although early ideas of technological enhancement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the human condition per se are suggested in the writings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Benjamin Franklin and Condorcet. Many of the enlightenment ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are today so integral to liberal democracy that they are not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognized as being non-trivial and based on a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective on humanity (except possibly when challenged by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theocrats and conservatives, who have different views of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutes a human being and the good life). When extropians are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called libertarians and anarcho-capitalists, it often turns out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the issue is often their defense of enlightenment ideas in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition to later romantic and especially collectivist ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is important to note the collectivist emphasis here: the goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not to create a better life for individual humans but for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humanity - the collective, rather than the individual (&quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual is only a function of the collective&quot;, as Marx put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it). The profound influence of collectivism in this period cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be overstated, regardless of it being Marxist class collectivism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazist race collectivism or nationalist collectivism. It is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coincidence that Stapledon describes his posthuman and advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien civilizations as communist or fascist states, with global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness as the supreme goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am no Marxist but I truly wonder sometimes how many people around here
<br>
have actually read anything of Marx. Marx is not Stalin just as Nietzsche is
<br>
not Hitler. There is a scholarly tradition that sees Marx through the
<br>
influence of Hegel as opposed to Stalin. (And given the relative poverty of
<br>
backwards causation I have some sympathy with this view). Hegel sees the
<br>
history of the West as the march of Freedom, the goal or telos of the World
<br>
is for all to be free. (Not just for some to be free, as with the Ancient
<br>
Greeks, or for the one to be free, as with the emperor/god models of the
<br>
Egyptians, etc.) Marx stands in this tradition. He thought that capitalism
<br>
constrained rather than enabled freedom and that the state would wither away
<br>
once the final stage of history was achieved. Marx believed that people
<br>
would freely choose how to spend their time in productive activities, in his
<br>
famous remark (which roughly goes) Individuals can choose to &quot;hunt in the
<br>
morning, fish in the afternoon,
<br>
rear cattle in the evening, write literary criticism after dinner. I think
<br>
that Marx was naive about this, but that no more makes him responsible for
<br>
Stalinistic excess than Nietzsche is responsible for fascism. It is true
<br>
that Marx endorsed a coercive collective action to help free victims of
<br>
bourgeoisie ideology. We may disagree with his assessment of who needed
<br>
saving, but it is not a distinction we can do without. Some of us think, for
<br>
example, that we might legitimately use coercive action to save victims of
<br>
cult brainwashing. Marx thought that capitalism similarly brainwashed its
<br>
victims. Given the horrors of the twentieth century I doubt Marx would be a
<br>
Marxist if he were alive today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I started out thinking along transhumanist lines, I took a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wholly technocentric view. The goal was to maximize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information content or complexity of the universe; to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this certain steps of technological development were necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as space colonization and AI), and to make these possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other developments, including political, economical and social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones, were necessary subgoals. Society and to some extent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual were secondary to a grandiose technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am glad to see you have stepped back from this. As I have suggested on
<br>
this list in the past, I find the negentropy metaphor somewhat dangerous.
<br>
The danger lies in the fact that entropy in the second law sense does not
<br>
allow for qualitative rather than quantitative measurements. Compared to the
<br>
rest of the universe the molecules of a banana and a human are information
<br>
dense. How many bananas does it take to exceed the quantitative information
<br>
of one human? ..Perhaps it is more negentropy efficient to upload
<br>
bananas.......
<br>
<em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between a radical anarcho-capitalist and a liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democrat lies mainly in the emphasis and relative ranking of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain rights, general views on how society should be organized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and - usually the controversial part - what level of coerciveness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is acceptable. While this tends to lead to loud and long-winded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debates here and elsewhere (and in practice of course deals with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely important social issues), it is imperative to recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that both parts (and the whole spectrum between them) have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in common with each other than with the groups with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-humanist perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To sum up, the version of radical democratic transhumanism I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sketched here seems to be in accordance to the basic humanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values as long as it is voluntary. Adherents to this form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism will of course argue that it is a more effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of achieving human excellence than other forms such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian transhumanism, but the effectiveness issue is not as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important in this context as the recognition that both sides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share important core values. That they also have very divergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlooks is not a problem, since in principle a voluntary radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic transhumanism (somebody better invent a shorter term!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can co-exist and cooperate when suitable with a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism. Just as individual excellence can be pursued in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many unique ways, there is no reason transhumanism - even with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined core values - has to be expressed or implemented in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single model. But the same arguments that lead to humanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognition that this pluralism of individual striving must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected lead to the respect of people to freely choose what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social models to join.
</em><br>
<p>I agree here that in the grand scheme of things there is a lot of common
<br>
ground here. In fact I think that we are agreed that we should allow a
<br>
number of experiments in living. (I think that James agrees with
<br>
this--unless it was the whiskey doing the talking;).
<br>
<p>Here are some of the features I would like to incorporate as a political
<br>
ideal:
<br>
1. A World Federalism
<br>
2. Direct democracy--e voting: every citizen of the world should have access
<br>
to the net.
<br>
3. Enough flexibility for different experiments in living among the
<br>
federated states. There should be possibility of libertarian and social
<br>
democratic states.
<br>
4. Provisions for protecting and educating children--there will be limits to
<br>
what experiments in living can be applied to children.
<br>
5. A certain economic egalitarianism among the federations--what they do as
<br>
an internal matter will be left to some degree up to them.
<br>
6. Freedom of expression for all.
<br>
7. Freedom of movement between states.
<br>
<p>Other things being equal, I think smaller is better: smaller governments and
<br>
smaller capital/management structures.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I would like to see more emphasis by Transhumanists on how existing
<br>
technologies might advance the lives of humanity now. I would like to see,
<br>
for example, transhumanist declare a world government based on a direct
<br>
democratic model whose sphere of influence would include at least cases of
<br>
imminent existential threats (in Nick's sense).  Obviously no one will
<br>
listen to us initially, but if we get enough people on board we might get
<br>
some attention. I think projects like this will show the politically and
<br>
ethically progressive nature of technology.
