<p>
I'll have to say &quot;me too&quot; as well.  That was a nice message, Eliezer, and
<br>
it started a good discussion.  The only thing is: why'd you have to do it
<br>
when so many of us were predictably on vacation?
<br>
<p>Now that the conversation has died down, I feel free to pick through what
<br>
remains and comment broadly on a few points.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...] If [...] ExI takes a serious hit from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the xenophobia now being tossed about on the mailing list in the name of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free speech don't say I didn't warn you [...].  I am sick and tired of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearing about how transhumanism [...] is a form of Social Darwinism in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the slow runners are forced out of the race [...].
</em><br>
<p>I took Eliezer's comment about xenophobia to be referring to recent 
<br>
comments in the mold of &quot;jobs for Americans first.&quot;  Others took it as a 
<br>
complaint about racism, which I haven't seen much evidence for.  The 
<br>
references to other countries have mostly been protectionist rather than 
<br>
prejudiced.  
<br>
<p>Since I was on vacation, I wasn't able to speak up, so I'll do so now.  I
<br>
believe in comparative advantage.  I think that the &quot;creative destruction&quot;
<br>
that the market practices is a good thing.  There can be no progress if
<br>
businesses cannot fail.  The constant change produces an environment that
<br>
requires every enterprise to constantly improve its productivity.  That
<br>
means finding the most cost effective ways to get the job done.  When that
<br>
means hiring overseas, it's the right thing to do.  The people fired in
<br>
the wake of change are idle hands ready to work on the next thing to come
<br>
along.  In a free society, someone will find work for them.  (If you are
<br>
idle, and no one has work for you, be the someone yourself!)  It is only 
<br>
in societies that outlaw new enterprise that unemployment is a problem.
<br>
<p>I don't think national boundaries should matter for trade or for jobs.  
<br>
The current pragmatics are that our welfare laws make it tough to allow 
<br>
unlimited entry.  The recent terrorist acts, and the continuing concern 
<br>
about further acts have provided an opening for those who believe in 
<br>
glorifying artificial boundaries.  I think we should be very careful
<br>
about 
<br>
allowing these concerns to push us too far from our long-standing policy
<br>
of 
<br>
open borders.
<br>
<p>Some here have argued that we need to make sure that those who enter
<br>
already hold beliefs consistent with our trusting society.  I will only
<br>
concede on the point of those who want to come here to perpetrate
<br>
violence.  Other than that, I'd welcome any who want to work, to raise
<br>
children, or to get an education.  Whatever they're looking for is
<br>
available only as part of a bundle that will entice them or their children
<br>
into buying the package.
<br>
<p>They don't come here (other than the terrorists) in order to find a more
<br>
comfortable version of home.  If they come for a living wage, they'll 
<br>
find they have to live and work among a diversity of people.  If they
<br>
come 
<br>
for an education, they'll have to work to make it.  When they start a 
<br>
family, they'll yearn for the same comforts for their children as the 
<br>
rest of us, and work as hard as it takes to make it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [..] I grew up reading [science fiction] books that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preached peace and tolerance toward other life forms, whether they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands or tentacles, whether they breathed oxygen or liquid helium, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long as they were sentient.  [...] what the books tried to teach was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerance of *aliens*.  [...]
</em><br>
<p>Me, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only the most clueless of Singularity gradualists, in severe hard takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denial, could even begin to imagine that the Singularity was an argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Social Darwinism [...]  If the value of the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is a quadrillion dollars, and a quintillion dollars of new wealth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created by an egalitarian superintelligence, the previous distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth becomes irrelevant.  [...]  We win together, or lose together.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all in the same boat.
</em><br>
<p>I kept trying to figure out what I disagreed with about this.  I'm sure 
<br>
I'm a &quot;Singularity gradualist, in severe hard takeoff denial.&quot;  But I
<br>
end 
<br>
up thinking that the argument is stronger from a gradualist perspective.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The statistics (according to Julian Simon, of course) show that in most 
<br>
cases, as technology advances, the rich do keep getting richer, but the 
<br>
gap keeps getting proportionately smaller.  Those who worry about the 
<br>
have-nots, when they have statistics always show the ones that show that 
<br>
some people are still behind, and don't check to see whether they are 
<br>
catching up.  We can argue about gradualism again, but since we agree on 
<br>
the outcome, there's no need to do so here.

</em><br>
<p>I believe we benefit by taking advantage of others attempt to attack us by
<br>
subsidizing the goods they sell us.  I believe we are harmed when we cut
<br>
off trade to punish another country's acts.  (In both sentences, there 
<br>
are different groups represented by the various uses of &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;.  
<br>
We (society, government, pick your favorite agent) don't have the right
<br>
to 
<br>
force some to pay the cost.)  On the whole, we'll all be better off if
<br>
we 
<br>
pursue a consistent unilateral policy of free trade.  
<br>
<p>in response to this bit of Eliezer's message:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If Extropy and ExI takes a serious hit from the xenophobia
</em><br>
<p>Cryofan wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; You mean if it hampers their ability to snag consultation fees from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business lobbies  for providing justification for further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; globalization and immigration?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what drives this attack.  Is ExI &quot;snagging consultation fees
<br>
from business lobbies&quot;?  Do you think Eliezer was defending something
<br>
underhanded?  I thought he was talking about Extropy and ExI as social
<br>
movements attempting to promulgate ideas, and referred to the possibility
<br>
that they would be undercut in public discussions if the membership is
<br>
associated with unsavory viewpoints.  
<br>
<p>I think your disagreement is about whether xenophobia is seen as 
<br>
unsavory, or whether the viewpoints expressed here recently qualify as 
<br>
such, not with ExI's goals and methods.  Am I wrong?
<br>
<p>Cryofan continued
<br>
<em>&gt; If you and I buy a house and live in it [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can Joe Schmoe down the street come live in it for free?
</em><br>
<p>I disagree that allowing people to compete for jobs is giving them a
<br>
free 
<br>
benefit.  It's trade.  If Joe is offering a better price, and I like the 
<br>
service he's offering, I may buy from him.
