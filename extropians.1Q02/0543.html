<em>&gt;In an open letter to Estelle Morris, Richard Dawkins calls on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Government to think again about funding yet more divisive faith schools
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sunday December 30, 2001 The Observer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dear secretary of state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Government has decided, reasonably enough, that heredity is no basis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for membership of Parliament, and the hereditary peers are either gone or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on their way. Yet, in the very same year, you propose increasing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of faith schools. Having disavowed the hereditary principle for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;membership of Parliament, you seem hell-bent on promoting the hereditary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle for the transmission of beliefs and opinions. For that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precisely what religions are: hereditary beliefs and opinions. To quote 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the headline of a fine article in the Guardian last week by the Reverend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Don Cupitt: 'We need to make a clean break with heritage religion and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create something better suited to our own time.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We vary in our opinions and our tastes, and it is one of our glories. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some of us are left-wing, others right. Some are pro-euro, others anti-. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some listen to Beethoven, others Armstrong. Some watch birds, others 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collect stamps. It is only to be expected that our elders should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influence us in all such matters. All this is normal and praiseworthy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In particular, it is normal and pleasing that parental impact should be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strong. I'm not talking particularly about genes, but about all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influences that parents inevitably bring. It is to be expected that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cricketing fathers will bowl to their sons - or daughters - on the back 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lawn, take them to Lords, and pass on their love of the game. There will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be some tendency for ornithologists to have bird-watching children, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bibliophiles book-loving children. Beliefs and tastes, political biases 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and hobbies, these will tend, at least statistically, to pass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longitudinally down generations, and nobody would wish it otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But now we come to religion, and an extremely odd thing happens. Where we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might have said, 'knowing his father, I expect young Cowdrey will take up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cricket,' we emphatically do not say, 'With her devout Catholic parents, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I expect young Bernadette will take up Catholicism.' Instead we say, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without a moment's hesitation or a qualm of misgiving, 'Bernadette is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Catholic'. We state it as simple fact even when she is far too young to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have developed a theological opinion of her own. In all other spheres, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good school will encourage her to develop her own tastes and opinions, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;her own skills, penchants and values. But when it comes to religion, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society meekly makes a clanging exception. We inexplicably accept that, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the day she is born, Bernadette has a label tied around her neck. This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Catholic baby.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That is a protestant baby. This is a Hindu baby. That is a Muslim baby. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This baby thinks there are many gods. That baby is adamant that there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only one. But it is preposterous that we do this to children. They are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too young to know what they think. To slap a label on a child at birth - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to announce, in advance, as a matter of hereditary presumption if not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determinate certainty, an infant's opinions on the cosmos and creation, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on life and afterlives, on sexual ethics, abortion and euthanasia - is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;form of mental child abuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I do not believe it is possible to mount a decent defence against my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;charge. Yet infant belief-labels are almost universally accepted. We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't even think about it. Just in case any lingering doubt remains, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider the following: This child is a Gramscian Marxist. That child is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Trotskyite Syndicalist. This third child is a Wet Conservative. This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;baby is a Keynesian. That baby is a Monetarist. This baby is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ornithologist. Not, 'This baby is likely to become an ornithologist if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his father has anything to do with it.' That would be fine. But, 'this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;baby is an ornithologist'? Unthinkable, isn't it? Yet, where religion is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerned, you don't give it a second glance. Oh, and by the way, nobody, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least of all an atheist, ever talks about an 'atheist child'. Rightly so. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But why the double standard?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I presume you need no more convincing. For parents to influence their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children's opinions and beliefs is inevitable and proper. But to tie 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;labels to young children, which in effect presume and presuppose the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;success of that parental influence, is wicked and indefensible. But, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may soothingly say, don't worry, wait till they go to school, it'll be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fine. The children will be educated in a variety of opinions and beliefs, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they'll be taught to think for themselves, they'll make up their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds. Well, it would have been nice to think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But what do we do? We deliberately set up, and massively subsidise, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;segregated faith schools. As if it were not enough that we fasten 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;belief-labels on babies at birth, those badges of mental apartheid are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now reinforced and refreshed. In their separate schools, children are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;separately taught mutually incompatible beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'Protestant children' go to the state-subsidised Protestant school. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are lucky, they won't actually be taught to hate Catholics, but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't bank on it, especially in Northern Ireland. The best we can hope 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for is that they will come out thinking only that there is something a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit alien or odd about Catholics. 'Catholic children' go to the Catholic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school. Even if they are not taught to hate Protestants (again, don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bank on it), and even if they don't have to run the gauntlet of hate in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Ardoyne, we can be sure they won't be taught the same Irish history 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the 'Protestant children' down the street.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Secretary of state, even if I fail to convince you that opening new faith 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools is downright insane, may I at least plead for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness-raising exercise in your own department? Just as feminists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;succeeded in making us wince when we hear 'he' where no sex is intended, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or 'man' for humanity, we need to raise our consciousness about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faith-labelling of children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please, I beg you, strongly discourage the use, in all ministerial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;documents and inter-departmental memos, of phrases that presume 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theological opinions in children too young to have any. Please foster a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;climate in which it becomes impossible to use a phrase like 'Catholic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children', 'Protestant children', 'Jewish children' or 'Muslim children' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without wincing. It only costs two words more to say, for instance, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'children of Muslim parents' or 'children of Jewish parents'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One of the more frightening aspects of human nature is a tendency to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gravitate towards 'Us' and against 'Them'. Worse, Us versus Them disputes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a natural tendency to reach down the generations, leading to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vendettas of frightening historical tenacity. Where labels are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provided to feed our natural divisiveness, we manufacture them. Children 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;separate out into gangs, often with distinguishing labels. In certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;districts of Los Angeles, a young person innocently sporting the wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brand of trainers is in danger of being shot. Experiments have been done 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in which children, with no particular reason to sort themselves into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gangs, are provided with, say, green or blue labels. In short order, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enmities spring up between the greens and the blues: fierce loyalties to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one's own colour, vendettas against the other. These can become 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surprisingly vicious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's what happens when you don't even try to segregate children. Now, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imagine that you deliberately stamp a green or a blue label on a child at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;birth. Send this child to a blue school and that child to a green school. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Encourage green boys to assume that they will grow up to marry green 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;girls, while blue girls will marry blue boys. Take for granted that, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moment they have a baby of their own, it too must have the same coloured 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;label tied around its neck. Passed on down the generations, what is all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a recipe for? Do I need to spell it out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The very idea of a faith school is as unjustifiable as the idea of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hereditary House of Lords, and for the same reason. But hereditary peers, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though undemocratic and often mildly eccentric, are not dangerous. Faith 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools almost certainly are. There remains the pragmatic argument that, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notwithstanding the knockdown objection to the principle of faith 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools, they get good exam results. Well, maybe. If it is true, by all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means let's try to bottle the secret, and share it around. But, bottled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or not, careful analysis fails to uncover any real link with faith. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ingredient in the bottle is a school ethos, which can take years to grow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and which, for reasons having no connection with religion, has become 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;built up in certain Church of England and Roman Catholic schools. A high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reputation, once built, is self-perpetuating, because ambitious, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education-loving parents gravitate towards it, even to the extent of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretending to be churchgoers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But in any case, where have we heard something like the pragmatic, 'exam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;results' argument before? Yes, in the debate over the hereditary peers. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People were fond of saying that, no matter how undemocratic was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle of hereditary members of Parliament, they got results. Enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aristocrats worked hard, some were real experts on fly fishing, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;windmills; some were doctors who had wise things to say about the health 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;service; many were farmers who could hold forth on foot and mouth or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Common Agricultural Policy; and all of them preserved the decencies of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debate, unlike that rabble in the Commons. Undemocratic they may have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been, but they did a good job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That argument cut no ice with the Government, and rightly so. If you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gather together a bunch of men of above average wealth and education, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;raised in book-lined homes for many generations, it is hardly surprising 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that some expertise and talent will surface. The pragmatic argument, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hereditary peers do a good job, is on the slippery slope to 'say what you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like about Mussolini, at least he made the trains run on time'. There are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limits beyond which principle should not be dragged by pragmatism. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Government reached that limit over the hereditary peers. The pragmatic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case in favour of faith schools is similar, but weaker. The principled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case against faith schools is similar, but stronger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for what is to be done, of course we don't want to destroy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;institutions that are working well. The way to be fair to hitherto 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unsupported denominations is not to give them their own sectarian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools, but to remove the faith status of the existing schools (just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fair way to balance the bishops in the Lords is not to invite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mullahs, monsignors and rabbis to join them, but to throw the existing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bishops out). After everything we've been through this year, to persist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with financing segregated religion in sectarian schools is obstinate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;madness.
</em><br>
