<em>&gt;  - &quot;The US polio death rate was ~1/500 of the total US death rate when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the vaccine was introduced.&quot;  (Hence polio vaccine did not make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    major contribution to longevity.) &quot;I'd guess that Medicine of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    forms probably contributes less than 1 year to that 40 year increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in lifespan.  Since sanitation also doesn't seem that important,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    it is a big puzzle why exactly lifespan has increased so.&quot;  Also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    see <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/EC496/Sources/sources.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/EC496/Sources/sources.html</a> which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    many links on the question &quot;How Much Does Medicine Help Health&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think much of the confusion here is because the term &quot;health&quot; is being
<br>
used to cover several things that ought to be distinguished. Sometimes
<br>
people talk about &quot;life expectancy&quot;, sometimes about preventable death and
<br>
its incidence, sometimes about general well being and functioning, all of
<br>
which are different. One important point is that there hasn't been a  &quot;forty
<br>
year increase in lifespan&quot; - at least not in the way people commonly
<br>
imagine. What has happened in the last 200 years is a big decrease in infant
<br>
mortality which has the effect of sharply raising life expectancy *at
<br>
birth*. This is due mainly to the supply of potable water, education of
<br>
women, and improved childhood nutrition (because poor nutrition markedly
<br>
increases the likelihood of children dying from diseases such as mumps,
<br>
measles, rubella etc). However average age at death for people who have made
<br>
it past the age of 5 has gone up by a much smaller ammount, and current
<br>
research into things like the average age of adults  in Roman cemeteries
<br>
indicates we may still be overestimating it. So it's not that people are
<br>
actually living longer *in general* rather the number making it past the age
<br>
of 5 has gone up. Death rates at every age have declined but not by a
<br>
substantial figure. The role of medicine in this does seem to be much less
<br>
than one would imagine, and quite simple comparisons indicate that a lot of
<br>
the money spent on medicine in the U.S. and elsewhere is producing little
<br>
discernable result. Steve Davies
