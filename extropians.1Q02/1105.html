<p>2003.  The e-conomy is back on the right side of a U, a V, or a W,
<br>
but nobody's claiming it's a / again yet.
<br>
<p>Interviewer:  Welcome to PostDotCom.Inc!  After layoffs, hibernation,
<br>
re-startup on credit cards, personal bankruptcy, and finally new
<br>
money with an 8x liquidation preference that completely destroyed
<br>
the already infinitesmal value of existing options, we're hiring
<br>
again, and it feels good.  So, what've you been up to for the past
<br>
year?
<br>
<p>Interviewee 1:  Took a vertical round-the-world trip.  Hiking in
<br>
Patagonia was the best.  Now I'm totally rev'd to get back to work!
<br>
<p>Interviewee 2:  Used my savings to buy every .NET-in-21-days book
<br>
published and Bill Gates motivational tapes.  [incomprehensible
<br>
borgian chatter]
<br>
<p>Interviewee 3:  Kept my skills sharp contributing to an open source
<br>
project, see <a href="http://foo.sourceforge.net">http://foo.sourceforge.net</a>, got infected by the extreme
<br>
programming virus.
<br>
<p>Inteviewee 4:  Can you believe how badly Hushmail's customer service
<br>
sucks?  What, you don't know about that?  Aarghh, my efforts to
<br>
warn the public have failed, what a waste of a year!
<br>
<p><p>disclaimer: I'd like to go hiking in Patagonia, I think .NET and
<br>
XP have their merits, I tried Hushmail, but not probably not since
<br>
2.0, and I do sympathize, knowing lots of unemployed technical
<br>
people low on hope for employment in the short term.
