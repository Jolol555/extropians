<p>&lt;&lt;Life and intelligence could sustain themselves indefinitely in such a 
<br>
universe, even as the stars winked out and the galaxies were all swallowed by 
<br>
black holes, Dr. Freeman Dyson, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced 
<br>
Study, argued in a landmark paper in 1979. &quot;If my view of the future is 
<br>
correct,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it means that the world of physics and astronomy is also 
<br>
inexhaustible; no matter how far we go into the future, there will always be 
<br>
new things happening, new information coming in, new worlds to explore, a 
<br>
constantly expanding domain of life, consciousness, and memory.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, however, even Dr. Dyson admits that all bets are off. If recent 
<br>
astronomical observations are correct, the future of life and the universe 
<br>
will be far bleaker.
<br>
<p>In the last four years astronomers have reported evidence that the expansion 
<br>
of the universe is not just continuing but is speeding up, under the 
<br>
influence of a mysterious &quot;dark energy,&quot; an antigravity that seems to be 
<br>
embedded in space itself. If that is true and the universe goes on 
<br>
accelerating, astronomers say, rather than coasting gently into the night, 
<br>
distant galaxies will eventually be moving apart so quickly that they cannot 
<br>
communicate with one another. In effect, it would be like living in the 
<br>
middle of a black hole that kept getting emptier and colder.
<br>
<p><p>In such a universe, some physicists say, the usual methods of formulating 
<br>
physics may not all apply. Instead of new worlds coming into view, old ones 
<br>
would constantly be disappearing over the horizon, lost from view forever.
<br>
<p>Cosmological knowledge would be fragmented, with different observers doomed 
<br>
to seeing different pieces of the puzzle and no single observer able to know 
<br>
the fate of the whole universe or arrive at a theory of physics that was more 
<br>
than approximate.&gt;&gt;
