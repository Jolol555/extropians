Alejandro Dubrovsky has been kind enough to work with me offlist
<br>
and point out errors in my theoretical physics homework. I just
<br>
shared this real world story with him and then I thought everyone
<br>
could use a laugh...
<br>
<p><p><p>I worked for a summer during college for a cookie and pastry
<br>
company in the lab. One of my jobs was to do quality control tests
<br>
in the &quot;jam&quot; room, a room where they made jam for toaster pastries.
<br>
<p>The jam room was about 125' by 125' feet and filled with stainless
<br>
steel equipment. It had the oddest floor I had ever seen, it was
<br>
some sort of nontoxic substance that had been fused directly in
<br>
place, so there were no cracks for bacteria. The whole room was
<br>
steam sterilized a couple of times a day. That floor was well known
<br>
for being dangerously slippery when wet.
<br>
<p>Well one day I'm in there doing tests in the corner as the shift
<br>
changes, and the lead guy from the first shift is going to start
<br>
his first batch of jam.
<br>
<p>The jam was made in these giant horizontal mixers. The bowl of the
<br>
mixer was a stainless steel 3/4 cylinder with a lip on one edge
<br>
about 6' across and 20' long. You would rotate the cylinder
<br>
horizontally to add the ingredients, then rotate it vertically to
<br>
mix them via a log mixer that ran the length of the cylinder. When
<br>
it was ready you slowly rotated the cylinder and a 20 foot stream
<br>
of jam poured off into a waiting pre-sterilized stainless steel
<br>
car, about 5'across, 3' deep and 20' long.
<br>
<p>The first ingredient is dozens of 25 pound blocks of lard, so he
<br>
hits the button to open the mixer and walks off to get the cart
<br>
loaded with the blocks.
<br>
<p>He was in a hurry because he had called in that he was going to be
<br>
late that day.
<br>
<p>Well what he didn't know was that his buddy on the previous shift
<br>
heard he was going to be late, so being a nice guy decided to go
<br>
ahead and make his buddies first batch for him. And the new guy
<br>
forgot to check the mixer first...
<br>
<p>Yep, the mixer was loaded with thousands of pounds of grape jam,
<br>
and the mixer with no cart in place, opened at full speed, and a
<br>
20' wave of jam came pouring out of the mixer.
<br>
<p>Everybody started yelling at the same time as the jam came pouring
<br>
out. The mixer operator made a mad dive to get back to the mixer
<br>
but hit the jam slick first and promptly slammed into the floor.
<br>
<p>Now the jam quickly bounced off the walls and in seconds covered
<br>
the entire floor. I was in the corner and when I saw what was
<br>
happening, grabbed the ladder to the catwalk in the corner and
<br>
scampered out of the way and up to the catwalk to watch the fun.
<br>
<p>A dozen guys all dressed in white were now trying desperately not
<br>
to end up on the floor covered in grape jam.
<br>
<p>A few guys managed to get their feet the exact correct width apart
<br>
and stood perfectly still, others got their feet a little too wide
<br>
and started doing a slow motion splits till they fell over into the
<br>
jam. A couple who got their feet right started drifting slowly
<br>
across the slight incline toward the floor drains. Even guys who
<br>
were standing up clinging to equipment started falling over if they
<br>
made the slightest wrong move.
<br>
<p>Pretty soon everyone was down in the jam.
<br>
<p>Even attempting to move on hands and knees would generally end up
<br>
with your arms/legs splaying outward and ending up face first on
<br>
the floor. It was the slipperiest thing I'd ever seen.
<br>
<p>But a few careful souls did manage to negotiate their way out,
<br>
using the very careful direct lift-and-place method I was talking
<br>
about.
<br>
<p>Me? when I could stand up on the catwalk after laughing so hard, I
<br>
went out the upper deck door and went for help.
