<em>&gt;From: Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;<a href="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20Ashcroft%20Antics">lee@piclab.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I might agree if it were his house, or even his office interior. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the exterior of public buildings is public art.  That statue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost a lot of American tax dollars to build, and it's /ours/, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his.  And the fact that he spent 8,000 more of our tax dollars to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deprive us of its esthetic value is even worse.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Legally, he probably does have the discretion to decide how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spend the justice department's budget on art, and he can make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judgments about the esthetic value of that art.  But when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generations of his predecessors all worked hard to create and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preserve that particular piece, it seems something of a slap in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their face to vandalize it.  At least his change is removable so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they next AG with more sense can fix it.
</em><br>
<p><p>This whole thing is nothing more than the God-we-hate-Ashcroft-why
<br>
wasn't-Gore-elected liberal press trying to make a mountain out of
<br>
a molehill.
<br>
<p>Ashcroft hasn't suggested modifying or even removing the statue, he
<br>
just feels it is inappropriate backdrop sometimes, and as anyone
<br>
who has taken photography 101 will tell you, he is correct. (it's
<br>
too &quot;busy&quot; and detracts from the subject in the foreground)
<br>
<p>A temporary curtain is sometimes erected covering these statues
<br>
anyway, all that has been done is that permanent curtains will be
<br>
installed so that the statues can be temporarily removed from view
<br>
when appropriate.
<br>
<p>Conference over, the curtains are drawn back and the statues once
<br>
again on display.
<br>
<p>End of story.
