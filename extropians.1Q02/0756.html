<p>An advanced intelligence can't help creating agents. It's not a monode,

it's a big messy thing. It's no more in control than we are, and perhaps a

lot less, given the colossal canvass, and much larger population size.

<p><em>&gt; No assumptions are required if you assume the singularity rapidly

</em><br>
<p>Unless postsingularity strips darwinian regime it's still subject to the
<br>
same constraints.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm going to repeat this every time this discussion comes up.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; WE DO *NOT* HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT THE UNIVERSE

</em><br>
<p>I don't have to explain nonobservable phenomena. Given that even very
<br>
modest engineering would be apparent from watching the skies with
<br>
uninstrumented eye I don't think I have to explain anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The faulty assumption is that if the engineering could be done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything would appear &quot;engineered&quot; (to us). *We* can engineer, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are parts of the Earth and solar system that appear very
</em><br>
<p>The Earth looks very engineered even from a great distance. Solar system,
<br>
yes, but because we're not a space-faring species yet. In several decades
<br>
the local system will probably become rather obviously engineered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; un-engineered -- whether by intent or simply the fact that we haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten around to engineering them because they is no economic benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or we may lack the matter &amp; energy resources) to engineer them at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this point.
</em><br>
<p>The reason we're not doing it is because we can't. We can't make
<br>
self-replicating machinery yet. Even partial closures gives us major
<br>
indigestion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can make a strong assertion that in the beginning there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was no engineering.  One may make an assertion that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end (after all the protons decay, if they do so)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be no surviving engineering.  But given that
</em><br>
<p>We don't know enough physics to tell definitely yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we and our engineering exist -- the simplest assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that we are someplace in the middle of the development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of engineering the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Anthropic effect says we cannot derive any population data from the mere
<br>
fact of us observing ourselves (try stating the same question a mere
<br>
century ago). Any evidence seems to imply we're the brand new kids on the
<br>
brand new block.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The historic arguments have been that &quot;seeds&quot; are cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;independent actors&quot; will explore and colonize.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you have to get this (I've thought about it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot) -- once you know you have trumped the hazard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function of the galaxy -- &quot;seeds&quot; and &quot;independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actors&quot; are significant threats to your long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival!
</em><br>
<p>Er, as I see it, after the Omega plateau is reached (which can be rather
<br>
soon, in terms of human years) the residual fitness function fluctuation
<br>
is low-amplitude and random.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *So*, one may become an essentialy existentialist actor --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I might as well live today, because sooner or later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my children, agents, seeds, etc. will eliminate me.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *or* one says that I am not going to produce anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may compete with me for future resources.  (Thus
</em><br>
<p>I don't have your scruples, and hence drive you to extinction, assumign
<br>
you're pre-Omega plateau.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; one only creates sub-minds running on your own hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and one deletes these programs once they have outlived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their usefullness.)
</em><br>
<p>I think we'll see plenty of predatory activity in physical space, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the most &quot;trustable&quot; agent?  One that you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squash like a bug if it threatens you in any way.
</em><br>
<p>YOU'RE NOT IN CONTROL. What makes you think your successors or you-derived
<br>
systems are ever going to have more control than you? On which evidence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As recent events have shown -- if you give an agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a certain amount of power, then ignore it, it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow to a level that it can inflict significant harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon oneself.  In which case you have to apply significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to eliminating such agents and may have relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little confidence that you have been successful in doing so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not believe that is the way that &quot;advanced&quot; civiliztions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or more probably SIs) will behave.
</em><br>
<p>For certain, we're not talking about people here. So all bets are off.
<br>
But, in absence of further information when gazing into the crystal ball
<br>
you must apply extremely basic assumptions about constraints such agents
<br>
are subject to. Given evolution, and absence of mechanisms of how to strip
<br>
off the Darwinian regime I don't see how you can propose them following
<br>
the course of action as you've described.
<br>
<p>It's not impossible, but you'll need a lot more data to convince us.
