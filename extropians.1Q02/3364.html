Sir Isaac will do here. Assume that the system brings the rear car to rest
<br>
at a constant deceleration and that no energy is lost in crumpling the lead
<br>
vehicle:
<br>
F*deltaT = M * deltaV (a kludged/averaged F = ma). Also assuming the
<br>
incoming detritus was brought to rest in 1 car length (say 5meters).
<br>
<p>Converting oldeworlderubbishunits to real units that the rest of the world
<br>
uses:
<br>
:-) poke poke...
<br>
stationary object = 1364 kg
<br>
stationary person = 100 kg
<br>
moving object = 1818kg @ 56km/hr (= 15.5m/sec)
<br>
Time to halt the incoming vehicle = 5/15.5 = .323sec
<br>
Average force applied by the incoming car to the combined stationary mass  =
<br>
70254N.
<br>
The average work done by this on the stationary mass is 70254 * 5 = 351270
<br>
/joules
<br>
This was imparted in .323 second, meaning an power of 1.089MW applied for
<br>
.323 seconds.
<br>
The person would receive 100/1464 of this = 24028 joules (~74kW!). Hug 74
<br>
single bar radiator elements for .323 secs and see how you look afterwards.
<br>
<p>Assuming that the person's contact period with the car is somewhere under
<br>
.323 seconds then the energy imparted would be less. When the DeltaV of
<br>
objects becomes equal you would disconnect from the lead vehicle and leave
<br>
the system. The overall conservation of momentum would mean this occurs at
<br>
0.179 secs (roughly when the speeds are equal) when the crumpling car/human
<br>
combo has travelled 0.5*(70254/1464)*(.179)^2 (constant acceleration from
<br>
rest) = 0.768m (right at the beginning of the 5m crash distance)
<br>
<p>Energy Imparted in this time approx 70254*0.768 = 53961 joules or an average
<br>
power of 30kW and assuming this is converted all to kinetic enrgy E =
<br>
0.5mv^2 the person would be travelling at 118km/hr = 75mph after an
<br>
acceleration of 183m/sec^2 for 0.179 seconds or 18.7G! This energy of 70254
<br>
joules would be converted to heat as the person came to rest, being smashed
<br>
up in the process. During this period your cortex would be sloshing around
<br>
inside your skull like a sock full of custard.
<br>
<p>Ouch. If I'm 50% wrong on this it's still OUCH. Thank you Sir Isaac.

<em>&gt; Subject: Physics Question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose I am stepping out of the seat of a high, stopped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vehicle (a 3000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pound mini-van), which is stopped on ice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose, further, that I have placed one foot outside the van, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground, and have begun standing on that leg, when:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The van I am climbing out of is struck from behind by a 4000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pound car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traveling at, say 35 miles per hour.  The car striking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; van comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest, imparting it's energy to the van, which quickly comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up to a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (~35 mph?) speed.  Since my torso is still in the doorway,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rear leading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edge of the door frame strikes me in the back at whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed the car is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traveling, accelerating my 220 pound body like the blow from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a giant hammer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the impact zone between the door frame and my back being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 1 inch by 8
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inches).   Luckily for me, the impact was felt about 2 inches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my spine, so I was only badly hurt, but not paralyzed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My physics question is: how does one characterize the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurred here?   I'm especially interested in being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy was in the blow that I received.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks!
</em><br>
