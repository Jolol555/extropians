From: &quot;Emlyn O'regan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au?Subject=Re:%20sentient%20rights%20(was%20RE:%20Battleground%20God)">oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; To me, the pursuit of perfection would imply a process with a beginning &amp;
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; end for each individual. Extropianism seems to imply a process of
</em><br>
unbounded
<br>
<em>&gt; improvement, ie: a beginning but no end. This would seem to be a
</em><br>
significant
<br>
<em>&gt; incompatibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Further, your Absolute Perfectionism seems to imply an absolute standard
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; perfection. This is completely contrary to the &quot;self transformation&quot; ethic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in transhumanism, which would encourage diversity, not sameness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The main concern of the paper is to contrast human perfection with the
<br>
ambition to move in the direction of a godlike perfection. Perfectionists
<br>
typically define the ideal of perfection in terms of perfecting one's human
<br>
nature. For transhumanists this looks quaint, given that human nature is
<br>
malleable. In the vernacular, the essay contrast an ethic which takes the
<br>
development of human nature as the ideal and an ethic which takes the ideal
<br>
to become posthuman. So on this point I think we are at cross purposes. In
<br>
&quot;What is Transhumanism? What is a Transhumanist?&quot;
<br>
(www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm) I distinguish between type and attribute
<br>
perfection. The former is the ideal of being an excellent example of say a
<br>
species, a perfect monkey, a perfect human, etc. Most perfectionist (e.g.,
<br>
Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, Marx, etc.) think in terms of type perfection. I
<br>
argue that attribute perfection makes more sense for transhumanists:
<br>
musicians might seek to improve their musicality attribute, philosophers
<br>
their wisdom, etc. In terms of diversity it is a little premature to say. If
<br>
it is possible for each of us to embody complete perfection that is, to have
<br>
all worthwhile attributes then, I certainly don't have a problem if others
<br>
want to join me in being perfect in all worthwhile ways. (My kids have a
<br>
different set of values: this would be an instance of being a copycat,
<br>
punishable in all sorts of unspeakable ways). Whether it is possible to
<br>
develop our attributes or develop new ones in an unbounded way is to my mind
<br>
an empirical conjecture. Take intelligence for example. Some physicists
<br>
think we are close to discoverying a final theory of everything. A
<br>
consequence of this it seems that even a guy with the brain the size of
<br>
jupiter would not be able to improve on this theoretical conceptualization
<br>
of the fundamental laws of physics. (Not to mention the practical problems:
<br>
like where to buy a hat). Others think that a guy with a brain the size of
<br>
jupiter would find more things in heaven and earth than our dreamed of in
<br>
our string theory. You seem to assume that the latter is always the case.
<br>
Maybe, maybe not. (See www.markalanwalker.com/natu.htm for details on the
<br>
experimental protocol.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Really, I find the perfectionist ideal to be overly negative. We would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined in terms of what we have failed to attain, rather than who we are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
What can I say? Ethics is a boo-hoo subject. One of the attractions of
<br>
perfectionism to me is that it makes sense of our life as a project: I have
<br>
achieved a certain level of excellence but have a ways to go. Thankfully, I
<br>
still have sometime left. For a utilitarian a life would be measured in
<br>
having distributed so many units of pleasure (happiness, satisfactions,
<br>
etc.). For a deontologist it would be having saluted so many categorical
<br>
imperatives and failing to heed this many more.
