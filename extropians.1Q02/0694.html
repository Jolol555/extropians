<p>Assumes facts not in evidence.  Assumes that there is some reason
<br>
to engineer the universe.  This is an entirely an engineer-morphic
<br>
perspective.  Because sensor technology seems likely to exceed
<br>
travel technology (it consumes less energy) it seems likely
<br>
that you will know what is out there before you can go there.
<br>
Even a single example of an ATC that hasn't colonized
<br>
everything is going to put a crimp in any expansion plans.
<br>
You are going to think long and hard about *why* they haven't
<br>
the colonized everything?  (9th dimension beings lurking
<br>
along interstellar travel routes, no colonization
<br>
effort can provide a decent ROI to investors, there
<br>
is no point to playing location hopping -- constantly
<br>
avoiding GRB -- best to leave the neighborhood entirely,
<br>
due to speed-of-light delays, to advance, civilizations
<br>
must not get bigger -- they must get smaller, etc. etc.)
<br>
<p>You can assert that if ET exists he is more advanced.
<br>
<p>You CANNOT assume a civilization a million or billion years
<br>
more advanced would be engineering the &quot;universe&quot;.  It may
<br>
seem like a nice idea from where we sit -- but they may
<br>
have found better ways.
<br>
<p>Furthermore -- Marvin Minsky pointed out *decades* ago
<br>
(in a conversation with Dyson in a conference with many
<br>
leading astronomers) that the most advanced civilizations
<br>
would only radiate heat energy at slightly above cosmic
<br>
microwave background radiation temperature.  Show me the
<br>
evidence that we have *any* ability to detect concentrated
<br>
sources with such temperatures!
<br>
<p>My papers on this are starting to be a year or more old
<br>
at this point folks.  Get a clue and *go* read the material.
