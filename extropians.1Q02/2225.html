<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; LIFE creates and identifies purposes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;purpose requires an entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;capable of /desire/ and /free will/; such an entity must be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;form goals that support its desires, and can therefore choose its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;own purposes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A kidney gets built into a developing phenotype because that arrangement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organized cells does a particular job acceptably well within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metabolizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entity. It obviously has a *function*, then; and it would be perverse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claim that it doesn't have a *purpose*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please explain exactly what is so perverse about a kidney not having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;purpose&quot;. A kidney has a &quot;function&quot; most definitely, but you fail to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impress upon me that it has a &quot;purpose&quot;. This whole argument is still bound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the definition of &quot;purpose&quot;, and hopefully we're speaking the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language here. My definition implies self-intent from a sentient being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That purpose was not *intended* by the evolutionary accidents and sievings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that built the kidney's constructional and operating code; there was no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outside mind *desiring* it. But each kidney serves a crucial purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that purpose is to function for the outside mind's desiring, surely?
</em><br>
<p>A kidney is part of the mind/brain/body in humans, therefore does not operate &quot;outside&quot;.
<br>
Its 'goal' or purpose is to maintain its 'kidneyhood', which requires 'offering' support to the external 'kidney carrier' (the rest
<br>
of the body) in exchange for survival and kidney reproduction. From the selfish kidney's perspective the purpose of life is to
<br>
create kidneys.
