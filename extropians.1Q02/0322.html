</em><br>
<p>John -- can you make the case that you equally distribute your
<br>
energies on a *per* death basis for each premature cause of death
<br>
that occurs in the U.S. (or the world)?
<br>
<p>The following cause more deaths annually in the U.S. than the 911
<br>
attacks: Suffocation, Fires &amp; Burns, Drowning, Poisoning by solids
<br>
and liquids, Falls and Motor vehicle crashes (from lowest to highest).
<br>
Motor vehicles, in particular kill more than an *order of magnitude*
<br>
annually relative to the 911 attacks.
<br>
<p>I don't see anyone here taking the &quot;hawk&quot; position over in Afghanistan
<br>
attempting to &quot;prevent more thousands of deaths&quot;.  I am reasonably
<br>
certain that arguing with Samantha day in and day out *isn't* going
<br>
to bring dead people back to life, nor is it going to significantly
<br>
make the U.S. a safer place to live.
<br>
<p>I would argue that it is irrational to place an excessive emphasis
<br>
on the 911 attacks to the exclusion of other causes of premature
<br>
death.  So rational individuals should (a) either start with
<br>
the leading cause of death (where are the &quot;safer motor vehicle&quot;
<br>
discussions!) or (b) attempt to distribute their time resources
<br>
proportionately over all the causes of premature death if they
<br>
intend to be truly extropic (and are not merely entertaining
<br>
themselves with manipulating the input bandwidth of several
<br>
hundred minds).  Further I would argue that actions speak much
<br>
louder than words.  Where are the reports of letters written
<br>
to consumer safety commissions?  Where are the films of extropians
<br>
demonstrating in front of GM/Ford/Crysler (whomever made the least
<br>
safe automobile this year)?  Where are &quot;Fall Awareness&quot; bumper
<br>
stickers they are selling &quot;at cost&quot;?
<br>
<p>Dead is dead.  If you want to make a *real* difference in fixing that
<br>
please do so.  If you also want to &quot;bias&quot; your agenda that is fine
<br>
with me -- just explain why this is your &quot;cause&quot; and acknowledge that
<br>
you are making a self-interested choice to focus on a non-representative
<br>
subset of the entire problem.  Sitting around and kvetching on the
<br>
Extropians list all day isn't going to do that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any forward progress, lives must be sacrificed somehow.  Whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it be considered experimentation by some, murder by others, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-sacrifice for a cause, they perish.
</em><br>
<p>I'd have to disagree with Dossy here.  There is a heck of a lot
<br>
of progress in medicine and safety regulations without requiring
<br>
that people be sacrificed.  It depends in large part on the degree
<br>
to which a society values life and is willing to think ahead and
<br>
make an investment in preventing situations that prematurely end it.
<br>
For example our ability to rapidly assay for anthrax is a result
<br>
of the Dept. of Defense anticipating bioterrorist attacks and
<br>
starting the development of more advanced methods to detect the
<br>
spores in the early 1990's.
<br>
<p>There is no doubt that in some cases people will die to draw our
<br>
attention to problems.  We can predict some of the problems some
<br>
of the time but we can't predict all of the problems all of the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's very extropian.  If 9/11 isn't a big boost for the extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause, I don't know what is.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree here as well.  If our response to the deaths that occurred
<br>
on 911 are disproportionate relative to other premature causes of
<br>
death then we may be making a large investment of resources in
<br>
areas that provide a very low ROI.  I would not know how to begin
<br>
making the argument trading off $ spent by the DoD to save a life
<br>
vs. $ spent by the NIH to save a life.  I do know that DoD probably
<br>
outspends the NIH by an order of magnitude while the causes of
<br>
death in this country would suggest the ratio *should* be a several
<br>
order of magnitude advantage for the NIH over the DOD.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The extropes should be pushing the notions of cloning,
</em><br>
(we do)
<br>
<em>&gt; mass cryostasis
</em><br>
(we should -- particularly for criminals or terrorists)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and uploads as technologies and techniques to make terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks such as 9/11 pointless, as any &quot;lives lost&quot; could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restored from a backup (uploads),
</em><br>
<p>It is not clear that real-time backups are feasible (I've done
<br>
some research on this and it is difficult).  If they are not then
<br>
promoting such ideas is counterproductive.  Instead one should be
<br>
promoting the prevention of the development of meme sets that
<br>
rationalize suicidal attacks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and cloning/downloads to restore actual dead.
</em><br>
<p>You can promote this but unless you can assert that lossless
<br>
backups are feasible most people aren't going to accept that
<br>
restoration of the dead is feasible.  Extropians should try
<br>
to fall on the conservative side of stretching the technology
<br>
boundary (at least if they want to be perceived as serious
<br>
individuals).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Otherwise, this whole stupid discussion is very off topic for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Extropians list, and ought to be taken offline/offlist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's getting petty and ridiculous.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  I for one would like to see people dedicate more time
<br>
to &quot;walking&quot; their talk instead of talking so much that the
<br>
rest of us begin to despair that it would have been better
<br>
had humans never come down from the trees to walk in the first
<br>
place.
