<p><em>&gt; My idea, in case there are any programmers

</em><br>
<em>&gt; centauri.  It starts in a similiar way that some other games out there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start, at the beginning of technological evolution, say early in the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the future from Type I to Type II onto Type III galactic
</em><br>
civilizations.
<br>
<em>&gt; Your map starts out as, say, a 1km x 1km grid, a town or village.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control individual units, they are all to scale and 3D models.  But, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and scale progresses, your map gets bigger and you can scale in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and out.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. This is exactly what I have been thinking of. It requires a
<br>
somewhat trustworthy AI to run your units, but could really get away
<br>
from the problem in SMAC that when you have a planet-spanning empire,
<br>
you are still micromanaging formers planting forest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------
<br>
<p>Definately, I cant imagine doing all that micromanaging.  Adding some random
<br>
fluctuations into the AI's managing might make things interesting as well,
<br>
to represent those occasional bad leaders that can really muck things up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The flow of time would not be linear as well, as you progress further,
</em><br>
time
<br>
<em>&gt; passes more rapidly (just as kurzweil speaks of the diminishing time
</em><br>
between
<br>
<em>&gt; salient events) At the basic level, time passes 1 sec for every second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; played, then moves to a 10:1, 100:1, etc. etc.  
</em><br>
<p>This is good, but it also introduces a limitation in multiplayer games.
<br>
Everybody needs to run at roughly the same speed, otherwise things will
<br>
not work. If player A is running at 100:1 and player B at 1:1, then we
<br>
have problems. For a single player game this is no problem. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>Yeah, I hadnt really worked this out all that much yet, its basically in the
<br>
'thinking about this' stage.  Multiplayer would definately require identical
<br>
flows of time, but a system similiar to the 'levels' in Everquest may be a
<br>
good one to follow.  For every 10^X increase in energy control /
<br>
consumption, etc, time flow may increase by a factor, and progress to the
<br>
next 'level' that way civilizations in multiplayer arenas would have to
<br>
compete only with civilizations on similiar scales.  You can still have
<br>
different civilizations at different times playing in the same universe, the
<br>
advanced ones would only see quick glimpses of the slow moving planets,
<br>
while the less advanced civ may see the advanced civ as snapshots taken of
<br>
the advanced civ status when they view it.  (does that make sense?) Id have
<br>
to think about that some more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The main measurement in the game will be energy, how much energy is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society producing how much can it control / harness (for transporation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, etc)
</em><br>
<p>I would use energy, information and control over matter as main
<br>
measurements. Information deals with how much information can be stored,
<br>
transmitted and controlled, matter control deals with the scale of
<br>
control (macrotech, microtech, nanotech, femtotech, plancktech...). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------------------
<br>
<p>Thats a good idea, I would definatel add those as measurements of progress.
<br>
What do you think should be in for resources as well, Id like to follow the
<br>
technological progress curve, stone, wood, iron, metals, etc for material
<br>
resources, food and water for support, and fuels, wood, coal, oil, nuclear,
<br>
etc for energy sources.  These all require managing at some level (which AI
<br>
can take over at different points of course) and infrastructures of their
<br>
own.  I can see this as getting really complex really fast...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would like to model algorithms that make up the names for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological breakthroughs, so they will not be limited or predifined,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; different civiliazations may have different means of accomplishing these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things (different size devices, different levels of effeciency, etc)
</em><br>
<p>And advances should not always have predictable or wholly good effects -
<br>
inventing AI should open a huge can of worms, as would methods of
<br>
motivation control. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------------------
<br>
<p>Hmm, good idea as well.  Would be difficult to implement, various past
<br>
technologies could have taken similiar turns, The more dynamic the game is
<br>
(the more it makes itself unique) as it goes along the better the
<br>
playability, and hopefully the more value in continued play.  
<br>
<p>So, know any good programmers with a lot of time on their hands =)
