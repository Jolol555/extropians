<p>&lt;&lt; We are no longer slaves to evolution.  We have the power to ameliorate some
<br>
&nbsp;changes now, and need not simply sit around letting them eat cake (to
<br>
&nbsp;forestall allocating some truly important things, like ... national health
<br>
&nbsp;insurance). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We are still slaves to evolution. We are just getting to the experimental 
<br>
phase where we can have green-glowing rabbits and perhaps grow organs from 
<br>
adult stem cells, maybe. So far, genetic technology has not really saved a 
<br>
whole lot of lives, have they?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Yes, if  it happens and when it happens ... but what about in the meantime?
<br>
We have the resources to effect good changes now (and just in case things
<br>
don't turn out as fast and as optimally as we would wish).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not sure we will have the clout to reorder the economy, or be 
<br>
influential enough to successfully persuade people that its in their interest 
<br>
to do thus and such. Most Americans are content, at this point, with HMO's 
<br>
and Cobra co-pays and medicare, for example. There is no rioting in the 
<br>
streets in demand of national health insurance currently. Nor, are there load 
<br>
voices demanding solar energy, or cars running 
<br>
on hydrogen, or space colonies. I am not celebrating this fact, just 
<br>
acknowledging it. This is our starting place and, face it, this is where we 
<br>
have been, for many years.
