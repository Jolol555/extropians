I'm a little surprised to feel a need to say these things on the
<br>
extropians list. It's basic.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey:
<br>
<em>&gt;While I am steadfastly opposed to the drug war, and support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legalized/medicalized drug use, I am also distinctly aware, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extensive personal experience, that an individual addicted to drugs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not a sane, mature, consenting citizen in control of themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(no matter whether the drug is alcohol, pot, coke, etc, even
</em><br>
tobacco).
<br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;In this respect, civil forfeiture functions (admittedly poorly) as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means of treating those who act like children as children. I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deny that it could be improved, in the form of making such seizures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporary, until the individual has gone through rehab and recovery,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than just a get rich quick scheme for policemen and police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;departments.
</em><br>
<p>What you're advocating here is that any Means is OK, as long as
<br>
*you* find the Ends *acceptable*.
<br>
<p>Drug-use is a victimless crime. The State has no business being
<br>
involved with what one does with their own person and property as
<br>
long as they don't physically harm the person or property of
<br>
another.
<br>
<p>I do not find your Means acceptable. Once you tell the government
<br>
that it's OK to throw someone in jail or take their property because
<br>
of some behavior that is not harming anyone else, but that you find
<br>
unacceptable, then what comes next? Firing them, evicting them,
<br>
denying them credit, stripping away their civil rights, and the list
<br>
goes on without end. If a person chooses to diminish their lives
<br>
by using some drugs, then they have every right to do so.
<br>
<p>All drug use carries a risk, and the risks are varied. As an adult,
<br>
each makes his/her own decision as to whether to expose themself to
<br>
that drug, and one measures the potential good/harm against their
<br>
own personal form of measure. &quot;Inform yourself, then choose&quot;. The
<br>
best way to remove the largest dangers regarding drug use is
<br>
education .. not throwing that person into jail !!
<br>
<p>Drug use is just one of a long list of victimless crimes, that the
<br>
State has no business sticking their stinking noses into. I wonder
<br>
if anyone here finds any similarities in the rhetoric between the
<br>
'War on Drugs' and the 'War on Terrorism' ?
<br>
<p>Amara
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Truth resides in every human heart, and one has to search
<br>
for it there, and to be guided by truth as one sees it.
<br>
But no one has a right to coerce others to act according
<br>
to his own view of truth.&quot;   -- Mohandas K. Gandhi
<br>
<p>&quot;Education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an
<br>
open one.&quot;  -- Malcolm S. Forbes
<br>
<p>Larry King:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't you think it would be better to legalize victimless
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crimes like drugs and prostitution and divert the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources to more important things like the rapes and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assaults and things like that?&quot;
<br>
Senator Tom Harkin:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I don't agree with that at all.&quot;
<br>
(&quot;Larry King Live' CNN, 1992)
<br>
<p>&quot;Drugs are murdering our children.&quot;   --George Bush 1989
