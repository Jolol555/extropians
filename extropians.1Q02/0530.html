</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was not involved with the World Transhumanist Association when I wrote the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essay, and only decided to get involved on the basis of the conclusions I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drew in it. The essay doesn't represent the views of the WTA, which I/we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hope will be a very broad tent including libertarians, Greens, social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;democrats, centrists and the apolitical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I especially hope that you don't hold my essay against the WTA since we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Extropy Institute to join as an organizational affiliate, and would like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropians to join as individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for Rasmussen's observation (which I was originally delighted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attribute to you, thinking you were &quot;Max M.&quot;), as someone who has expressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my democratic socialist views on the Extropy list at various points over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last eight years and been routinely flamed, I think he was fair to observe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the Extrop list did not often have left of center views expressed. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have seen more in this last year. As I say in the essay, I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanist milieu is growing and becoming more diverse, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representation of political views is increasing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>In many respects, mainstream Extropianism/Transhumanism was born of
<br>
the same mid-1980s ideas that were showcased/savaged in the Oliver
<br>
Stone move _Wall_Street_.
<br>
<p>You are absolutely right to try to bring some egalitarian ideas to
<br>
Extropianism/Transhumanism.  They will help us find acceptance for our
<br>
ideas about acceptance of GE and life extension memes.
<br>
Keep up the good work!
