<p>I know you know what a CA is, Samantha. I was addressing the strange being
<br>
known as the silicon love doll.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; computation on CA?  What kind of languages, methodologies, algorithms
</em><br>
<p>I haven't been following the field very closely, but there's material to
<br>
be found on <a href="http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/">http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/</a>

Fredkin has also become active recently: <a href="http://digitalphilosophy.org/">http://digitalphilosophy.org/</a>
<br>
Tommaso Toffoli is another from the triad worth reading (he's probably
<br>
switched chairs recently):

<p>Of course, I'm still hoping that Wolfram is going to deliver
<br>
<a href="http://wolframscience.com/">http://wolframscience.com/</a> within the next few months.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and so on most take advantage of such ultimate computer hardware?
</em><br>
<p>You could design a rule to simulate signal propagation along wires and
<br>
define gates, then compiling your code into a 3d circuit by same means as
<br>
silicon compilers do, but it's hardly efficient. An argument can be made
<br>
that the ideal rule should be Edge of Chaos one, and that the pattern
<br>
should make no distinction between code and data. I.e., it would be
<br>
something which you couldn't design by hand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Shouldn't some small-scale virtual models be build and various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software tools designed and evaluated on them today?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they should, but not many people are doing that, sadly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please point me to any relevant literature on the software side you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have handy.
</em><br>
<p>I think approaching the digitalphysics folks should give you plenty of
<br>
refs, if a session with Google is insufficient.
