<p>I think Damien's question does beg the issue however -- if memories
<br>
(or thought) require matter to preserve and the low level background
<br>
radiation of the universe provides sufficient energy for &quot;computation&quot;
<br>
(the Landauer brownian motion can produce computation perspective),
<br>
then Damien is correct -- one would never want to dump matter into
<br>
a black hole to produce energy.  Matter is much more valuable
<br>
as a bit storing medium -- not as a source of energy for computation!
<br>
<p>Of course we feel in the current era that producing and using the
<br>
energy as rapidly as we can is the correct perspective.  Perhaps
<br>
this is because we are in the era where bits generated per unit
<br>
energy consumed exceed bits consumed per unit energy generated.
<br>
But will that always be true?
<br>
<p>When does the Universe flip to the state when the value of
<br>
all &quot;organized&quot; matter exceeds the value of any information
<br>
that can be generated by consuming such organized matter?
<br>
To put this in terms that people may undersand -- when
<br>
will we reach the point of burning French paintings or
<br>
Russian novels in the fire &quot;just to keep us warm&quot;.
<br>
<p>This isn't a &quot;trivial&quot; question -- it is the question of &quot;when&quot;
<br>
does extropicness become irrelevant?  Of course one can argue
<br>
that the &quot;value&quot; of the stored memories is entirely subjective,
<br>
so one might always exchange old memories for newer memories that
<br>
one considers to be more valuable, in which case it would seem
<br>
that one consumes oneself in the neverending search for &quot;perfection&quot;.
<br>
<p>Since matter = energy and energy is required for thought it would
<br>
seem that one is caught between a rock and a hard place in terms
<br>
of what one can be -- who one was or who one is -- but not both.
<br>
<p>It seems inevitable that we must consume our memories
<br>
in order to survive.  Not a pretty picture.  It perhaps
<br>
gives new meaning to a perspective I've always been fond
<br>
of -- you must give up everything you are for what you
<br>
may become.  Is what we may become sufficient?
<br>
