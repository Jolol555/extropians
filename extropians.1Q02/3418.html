<p><p>huh?  Don't grok &quot;MMORPG&quot;.  The holy google leads me to think it 
<br>
has something to do with the gaming universe.  But I am not a 
<br>
dweller in that space so I am not sure what it is about.
<br>
<p>Is this what you meant by &quot;virtual&quot;?  I more have in mind 
<br>
building alternate secure, trusted, private communication, 
<br>
information and processing pools, economics, trade and so on 
<br>
online outside of the prying eyes and disasterous laws and 
<br>
politics of the every day meat space and its mirroring on the Net.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll take this as read, but convince yourself of this if needed. My thesis

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you aren't going to get a sufficient number who can be swayed to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>You must be kidding.  Everquest is a stupid addictive mind-fuck 
<br>
game that has absorbed some of my friends and kept them from 
<br>
doing anything productive for quite some time now.  Please say 
<br>
you are kidding.
<br>
<p>I am not a player but the space is much too limited and 
<br>
constrained to be a real viable internet community, much less 
<br>
the framework for a new civlization.  Bad drugs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; designed to be one; it's the natural end result of a critical mass of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing a crude escapist simulation of real life. It's an unrecognized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictatorship with many part-time residents from real-world nations who trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everquest intangibles on black markets in America and Europe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It is in no way a simulation of &quot;real life&quot;.  It is a game 
<br>
cleverly designed to suck you in for more and more hours.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, you have to be very into the whole virtual nation concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have heard of any of the attempts at deliberate virtual nation building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from any other starting point that do exist. (Serious or otherwise;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.smartuniverse.com/">http://www.smartuniverse.com/</a>).
</em><br>
<p><p>Cute but a bad parody of what might be possible.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Existing MMORPGs are seeding off into some interesting ideas on value,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political systems and exchange rates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/01/23/2131259.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/02/01/23/2131259.shtml</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	(flawed Norrath study showing that one can consider MMORPGs to have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy that can be related to the real world)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I have no problem in principle with that.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Lots more games in development, many with equally interesting twists in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; player-ownership, governing structures, economic relationships with the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, and so forth:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.massivemultiplayer.org/index.php?gIndex=1&amp;gc=0">http://www.massivemultiplayer.org/index.php?gIndex=1&amp;gc=0</a></em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Now, I do agree that it is very interesting designing and 
<br>
playing games to work out alternate ways of doing things, 
<br>
creating value and so on.  And of course, &quot;real&quot; virtual worlds 
<br>
where real value and living take place are very interesting to 
<br>
me.  But game hollow substitutes to escape from reality and to 
<br>
feed people's addiction without really giving them any space to 
<br>
create anything but more wealth for the designres and hosters of 
<br>
the game is not the way to a viable future in my opinion.  But 
<br>
we certainly may learn things there that are very important for 
<br>
uploaded/virtual life and for creating alternatives.
<br>
<p>I have often wished that there was a way to have the gaming mania
<br>
<p>actually solve real, important problems and create real value. 
<br>
That kind of dedication and fanaticism that I have seen in some 
<br>
of the elite players could do wonders if it was channeled. It is 
<br>
fun to think of possible games where this might be more true.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in theory, there's nothing stopping you making an MMORPG which guides and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewards the formation of governing bodies of your choice, while still being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun to play. A libertarian twist on a traditional MMORPG, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because it is a game, it could garner a large and persistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; userbase/populance/part-time inhabitants within a few years. EverQuest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boasts 300,000 subscribers, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes.  But you have to allow a lot of freedom, at least as much 
<br>
as in the real-world, to have a true virtual society/world 
<br>
evolve.  You need a set of basic &quot;physical&quot; laws and a few 
<br>
constraints on the inhabitants.  You also need that world to be 
<br>
taken seriously and have serious potential for real gain and 
<br>
loss and the creation of real value.  It needs more than to just 
<br>
be &quot;fun&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; A problem with existing MMORPGs for virtual nation building is their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centralization. Too easy to shut down by a physical world nation state that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to nip this thing in the bud. It's hard to wield economic clout if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have servers that can be shut down easily. One would have to take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next logical step and build an MMORPG around a decentralized peer-to-peer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system. This would probably have to be built on top of some form of early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model internet-scale operating system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1133">http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1133</a>].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>A decentralized peer-to-peer system has its own many problems of 
<br>
course.  Much of a virtual state would require massive amounts 
<br>
of storage of computational state.  Decentralizing that and yet 
<br>
keeping its coherency would require much cleverness and a lot of 
<br>
redundancy.  For some types of such worlds really meaty server 
<br>
machines are essential for many lesser classes of machine's 
<br>
owners to play at all.  The servers do not have to be stationary 
<br>
in meat or internet space of course, but they do have to exist. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stationary servers could also be in secret, hardened, 
<br>
difficult to stop, locations.  Perhaps you could even have such 
<br>
a thing claim the privileges granted to a religion and religious 
<br>
community.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Existing scalable peer-to-peer structures in development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/17/0530222&amp;mode=thread">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/17/0530222&amp;mode=thread</a>uld
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably suffice on their own if they weren't just regarded as a service.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Big difference between something that's a service (Napster, Gnutella) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that is, in effect, a second home (MMORPG).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, and a part of the difference is a  difference in bandwidth 
<br>
and concentrated computational resource needs.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Although the line between the two paragraphs above is pretty blurry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyhow, so lets say you have your ultra-cool, libertarian-leaning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; player-run MMORPG with 300,000 players based on the next Gnutella as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; platform. Or freenet. Or whatever. And this will happen; it probably won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be libertarian-leaning, but we'll have an ultra-cool player-run MMORPG with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least 300k players on a decentralized peer-to-peer platform five years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from now, I figure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>If we don't have a hell of a lot more than that in five years 
<br>
then I don't like the odds for freedom enough to reach Singularity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So at that point, you have the real seed for a true virtual nation, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which could start to try for recognition by real nations through economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leverage and the traditional routes of extablishing exchange rates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimizing existing black and gray markets, etc, etc. It seems to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this could head to a nice place to live a whole lot faster than building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own island or getting out of the gravity well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>You need real goods beyond entertainment items that are produced 
<br>
within the VR and real goods that flow in the reverse direction 
<br>
if you are going to effectively create a new kind of society in 
<br>
virtual space.  The current e-commerce might move into such a 
<br>
v-world in a big way.  Major data storage and representation, at 
<br>
least of some types, might turn out to be a natural.  But if you 
<br>
pull in real commerce from outside then outside laws and 
<br>
restrictions and politics come with it.  So this might not be a 
<br>
fine idea even if viable.  You need things that are produced 
<br>
naturally most competitively in such a space that are seen as a 
<br>
value outside.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But I am still pretty sick of society. We're overdue getting someplace to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>No argument there.
