<em>&gt;estropico wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropian philosophy = CMT + libertarianism + humanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No you don't.  Why do you keep adding libertarianism?  [snip] It is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inaccurate to say that it was only libertarian or that its purpose was more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian than transhumanistic.
</em><br>
<p>Because of the undeniable libertarian streak in extropian thought (which is 
<br>
fine by me, btw). All extropians are transhumanists, but not all 
<br>
transhumanists are extropians. The difference is that extropians are what I 
<br>
like to call spontaneuos-order transhumanists, while many transhumanists are 
<br>
not necessarily so (see J.Hughes).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why do you keep excluding transhumanism?  Extropy Institute was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;established to be a transhumanist organization.  This very list was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;founded as the first transhumanist list.  The Extropian Principles &gt;were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;written to establish a specific definition of transhumanism.  You &gt;can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretend that extropy has no connection to transhumanism.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously. Transhumanism is represented in my little formula by &quot;CMT&quot;. I 
<br>
realise now that that is too narrow and that the humanist streak should also 
<br>
be considered. Let's say then (again, to put it rather *brutally*):
<br>
<p>Extropian philosophy = Transhumanism (i.e. CMT+humanism)+ libertarianism
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyway, what I mean with my little formulas is that when humanists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considered how to deal with the coming technological advances and &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their impact on the human condition, the result was transhumanism. &gt; &gt; When 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarians did the same, the result was extropy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is not an accurate history.  Humanists did indeed create 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transhumanism. However those same transhumanists went on to define 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;extropian philosophy.  I don't see how you can separate their history &gt;or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;try to claim they evolved independently of each other.
</em><br>
<p>I was not trying to write the movement's history. Just reasoning that if 
<br>
transhumanism is what humanists came up with when they adopt the idea that 
<br>
it is right to use technology to improve on Homo Sapiens (the CMT), then 
<br>
extropy is what libertarians come up with in the same circumstances. Anyway, 
<br>
talking about the history of extropy, if you had to pick a single individual 
<br>
behind the birth of the extropian philosophy, who would you pick? Exactly. 
<br>
Max More's early libertarian writings are still available on the web.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Where are you getting these ideas?  They don't seem to match history &gt;or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make sense.  You seem to be trying to split the global &gt;transhumanist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;community into separate unrelated sectors.  etc...
</em><br>
<p>Not my goal. In fact, the recognition that the CMT is not necessarily bound 
<br>
to any particular idelogy could help avoiding the continuos bickering among 
<br>
tranhsumanists of different political convictions so typical of the list.
