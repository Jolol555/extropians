</em><br>
<p>I agree that there is an unhealthy tendency to link unconnected conflicts.
<br>
This is one of the things that I think US diplomacy (aided largely by the
<br>
UK) is doing a good job at countering, and I strongly applaud it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; There  are a lot of Islamic nations giving support to the current US action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are a few Islamic governments giving lukewarm support to the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US action, virtually no popular support at all, except ironically in countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have the most hostel governments of all, Iran and Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>Something is a lot better than nothing. Although I understand the US desire
<br>
to go it alone militarily, bringing along folks from other places is a very
<br>
good thing, particularly in the long run. Saudia Arabia allows US troops and
<br>
bases (nothwithstanding its own domestic issues); UAE is co-operating more
<br>
on the Cole bombing; Jordan has sent a frigate and possibly troops. All of
<br>
which are positive gestures to build on, and a credit to US/Western
<br>
diplomacy.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But despite it all Israel still exists, if they backed down every time the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palestinians exploded a car bomb in front of a grade school it would not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be great to have no enemies but that is often not possible so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just make sure he not only hates you but also fears you.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Similarly, if the Palestinians backed down every time the Israeli
<br>
army planted bombs that accidentally blew up children playing...but that's
<br>
another discussion entirely...I think the most important point here is that
<br>
adopting an uncompromising position on violence and seeking a political
<br>
solution are not mutually exclusive. For example, the Northern Ireland
<br>
political process seems (fingers crossed) to be working well, despite much
<br>
mutual mistrust and no compromise on violence from either side.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Geraint
