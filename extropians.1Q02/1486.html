<br>
enough to kill you.  I smoked 20 years and quit cold-turkey 11 
<br>
years ago.  Once I decided (meaning &quot;to cut off any 
<br>
alternative&quot;) it wasn't that bad.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Indeed, as Samantha said, just quit.  You are concioussly aware of your
<br>
actions, you are therefore then consciously aware of every time you reach
<br>
out a grab a cigarette, light it, and put it into your mouth.  If you truly
<br>
did not want to smoke, could anyone force you do to these things?  These are
<br>
not subconscious reflexive actions, you are fully aware of everything you
<br>
are doing.  It is an aspect of our liberalized paternalistic victim based
<br>
society in the US now that has everyone thinking they are not responsible
<br>
for their own actions.  Even Alcoholics Anonymous teaches that alcoholism is
<br>
a 'disease'.  I am sure that people with multiple sclerosis would LOVE to
<br>
just *decide* to not have it anymore.  The more the media and society can
<br>
convince you that you are not responsible for your own actions the more they
<br>
can get you to buy products to *help* overcome those choices you made (such
<br>
as smoking, eating high fat foods, etc)  All of our behavior, genetically
<br>
influenced or not, is filtered through a conscious awareness (unless you
<br>
sleepwalk and smoke)  If you truly do not want to smoke, then stop making
<br>
excuses, and just choose not to smoke.  Every time you reach out for a
<br>
cigarette, remember that you no longer want to smoke.  To use the cheesy
<br>
cliché 'You are who you CHOOSE to be' To often I hear people say 'That's
<br>
just the way he is, he cant help it' its usually an attempt to excuse some
<br>
type of unethical behavior (most recently, someone excusing a friend of
<br>
theirs inability to remain faithful) its also bullshit.  If you want to stop
<br>
smoking, just choose to never pick and light a cigarette again.  
<br>
<p>Thats my 2c anyway
