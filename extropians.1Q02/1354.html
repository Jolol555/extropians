</em><br>
<p>The diagram I was thinking of is on page 325 of &quot;The Ultimate Resource II&quot;. 
<br>
It shows infant mortality for blacks and whites from 1915 through 1990 in the
<br>
US.  Mortality declines strongly in both cases, black mortality is chasing
<br>
white mortality all the way down.  It starts at 100/1000 live births in 1915
<br>
for whites and 180/1000 for blacks.  The black statistics rises a bit at the
<br>
start and then fall steeply, so that by 1925 the numbers are ~75 and ~120 (by
<br>
eye).  By 1990, they're both under 20/1000, but the white numbers look to be
<br>
3/4 of the ones for blacks.
<br>
<p>I didn't mean that income inequality was shrinking, though I can see why you
<br>
might have thought that.  
<br>
<p>I was in general unimpressed by the arguments of &quot;Luxury Fever&quot;.  I agree that
<br>
many people are driven by envy and care about relative standing.  I don't see
<br>
that that gives the argument moral weight.  Some people are doing very well at
<br>
improving the lives of others, and they're being compensated very well for it.
<br>
&nbsp;That's why life is so much better for everyone, including the worst off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; one of the things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Ehrlich was still willing to bet on around 1994 was:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;The gap in wealth between the richest 10% of humanity and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poorest 10% will be greater in 2004 than in 1994&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't take Erlich's bet either.  I don't consider it important that
<br>
inequality fall, and I don't consider it a good measure of anything I value.
