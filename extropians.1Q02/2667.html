<p>
I'm about halfway through reading Ventus, the first novel by Canadian
<br>
writer Karl Schroeder, out in paperback.  It seems to be well written and
<br>
makes a good try at depicting a future in which ordinary human beings,
<br>
enhanced demigods, and super-human AIs all live together.
<br>
<p>The story takes place on the planet Ventus, where a terraforming
<br>
experiment gone wrong has left the Winds, AIs which are practically forces
<br>
of nature, in charge of the planet and mostly ignoring the humans they
<br>
were created to serve.  The entire planet is full of nanotech; every
<br>
rock, every tree, even every ripple in the ocean is alive with its own
<br>
consciousness, although they don't seem to do anything.  They just sit
<br>
there going, &quot;I'm a rock!&quot;  &quot;I'm a tree!&quot; but most humans can't perceive
<br>
the dialog.
<br>
<p>Here's a passage where a visitor describes the way life is on most of
<br>
the rest of millions of inhabited planets and habitats:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are a million organizing principles in human space.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None resemble Ventus.  Your world is unique, and the records of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the designs of the Winds were lost in a war centuries ago.  Most of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humanity lives in something known as the Archipelago - an immense
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region whose boundaries are so vague that most of its citizenry
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't even know of its existence.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now you're talking madness,&quot; smiled the Queen.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Archipelago is the only answer to ruling a population of trillions,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who own a million different cultures, mores and histories.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged.  &quot;It is simple: an artificial intelligence - a mechal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain, if you will - exists and mediates things.  It knows each and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every citizen personally and orchestrates their meetings with others,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communications and so on in order to avoid irreconcilable conflict.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, it stays out of sight, for it has no values, no desires
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of its own.  It is as if every person had their own guardian spirit,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and these spirits never warred, but acted in concert to improve
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people's lives.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A tyranny of condescension,&quot; said Galas.
<br>
<p>This is reminiscent of Eliezer's &quot;Friendly AI&quot; scenario, where the AI
<br>
acts benevolently to keep things running smoothly.  Which is better,
<br>
this &quot;tyranny of condescension&quot;, or a world in which people are free,
<br>
even though they bring harm to others?
<br>
<p>Hal
