Anders Sandberg wrote (26.2.2002/20:57) :
<br>
<em>&gt; I think I understand your view, and to some extent it is of course true:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you cannot come up with universal laws of gravity unless you have other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples of universal laws, mathematics and likely astronomy to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some objects of study. Hence they will occur subsequent to each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I'm not so convinced about the necessity in this process. Sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures do not take &quot;obvious&quot; steps for a long time (like the wheel and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mesoamericans) because the environment does not promote them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes culture intervenes, like the long period of stasis imposed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Ming in China, and sometimes economics (slavery inhibiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisation in antiquity). These are all examples of cul de sacs. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture can also promote exploration of certain issues with great energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (like astronomy has been strongly promoted in astrology-prone societies)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or lead to serependitious innovations (the discovery of lenses - leading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to telescopes, microscopes and optics - could have been done in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antiquity or china). The idea of linear progress inherent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity is sometimes said to have fuelled the expansion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; west, and that is true. But what about the Orthodox church in the east,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Islamic world with its similarly linear view? Small differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in interpretation - in several cases due to individuals and their power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games - caused them to behave far differently and give other priorities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their cultures. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The big question is: how deterministic is history? We can be certain it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not entirely deterministic - the tyfoon saving Japan from Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invasion was in the end due to sensitive dependency on initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions. We can also be certain it is not entirely random - as Jared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diamond pointed out in _Guns, Germs and Steel_ there are noticeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns in how different civilizations have evolved over huge amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time and great geographical separation. Is there any way we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decribe the exact amount of determinism? It is not so much a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantitative issue as a qualitative one. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree with most of what you say, including some doubts you raise.
<br>
<p>Just one note: I saw some determinism in the history of knowledge (and
<br>
in that particular part of knowledge which concerns the &quot;big picture&quot;,
<br>
aka world view); not in history in general. This is an important
<br>
distinction.
<br>
<p>It is often said that the idea of necessary progress has been
<br>
destroyed in the 20th century, with the holocaust, etc. Actually, I
<br>
think we don't need the 20th century to understand that there is no
<br>
such necessary general, social progress (to not mention &quot;moral
<br>
progress&quot;). Individuals have been in opposition until now (as designed
<br>
by evolution), and so wars are doing fine, thank you.
<br>
<p>But knowledge is different, because once it's recognized (and even
<br>
more so, if it's put to use in technology) you usually don't loose it.
<br>
I know it did happen (there is an interesting bit in Kaczynski's essay
<br>
about that), but usually it doesn't, it accumulates and gets better.
<br>
<p>If you assume there is some &quot;truth&quot;, or at least some &quot;more true than&quot;
<br>
relationship, and that it is sought, and that it is somewhat
<br>
recognized when found, and retained instead of forgotten -- then you
<br>
get some &quot;determinism&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you switch from knowledge to technology (as you did), then there is
<br>
a double aspect.
<br>
<p>On one hand, it is pretty much one single linear road provided you
<br>
have some communication between societies, because when one useful
<br>
invention is made somewhere, then it is adopted elsewhere. You spoke
<br>
about the wheel; it may not have been inventend somewhere for a long
<br>
time; but I am confident that, even there, it is now used.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, there is no &quot;technological perfection&quot; (like there
<br>
is truth in the knowledge domain), which means that there is probably
<br>
less determinism in technology than there is in knowledge. You say,
<br>
refering to the history of technology:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The issue isn't really religion here (although that is interesting), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather the determinism of history. Will the invention of the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitabily lead to the Internet and global freedom of information? Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the introduction of writing lead to monotheisms? Will the introduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of agriculture lead to the singularity? These are very relevant issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider.
</em><br>
<p>Just like you, I find pondering the necessity of technological
<br>
development quite interesting.
<br>
<p>I remember asking myself as a child things like: did we really HAD to
<br>
invent the toothbrush? And the obvious answer is no. We could have
<br>
inventend something else for the same usage. And in fact, from time to
<br>
time, one invention displaces another in some usage niche.
<br>
<p>So no (or little) determinism here. You have the linearity of
<br>
accumulation, and with inter-societal communication, you have only one
<br>
big technological road, but no determinism.
<br>
<p>But, in contrast, I see some determinism in knowledge development for
<br>
reasons said above. I read somewhere that some tribe, when last
<br>
checked, had not yet figured out the connection between sex and
<br>
babies. It sounded unplausible, but anyway: the connection wasn't
<br>
obvious all the time. It had to be realized. And it was realized,
<br>
independently, in many places (showing it followed &quot;determinism&quot;), and
<br>
never forgotten afterwards.
<br>
