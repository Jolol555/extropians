This is old-ish [and mindboggling] news, but I can't recall seeing it
<br>
previously:
<br>
===============================
<br>
<p>US researchers have reported that a strain of mice has the remarkable
<br>
capacity to regenerate cardiac tissue (Proc Natl Acad Sci 2001; 98:
<br>
9830-35). In 1998, the investigators discovered that MRL (Murphy/
<br>
Roths/Large) mice whose ears were punched could close the ear holes without
<br>
evidence of scarring. The team, led by Ellen Heber-Katz (The Wistar
<br>
Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA), has now studied the effect of damage to
<br>
the myocardium, caused by a cryoprobe. &quot;MRL mice and control mice both
<br>
showed clear signs of massive injury within the first few days&quot;, explains
<br>
Heber-Katz. &quot;However, within 2 months, the C57Bl/6 mouse [control] had vast
<br>
scarring in the right ventricle while the MRL mouse had almost
<br>
normal-looking heart tissue.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;This is a lovely study&quot;, comments Rosenthal. &quot;The group has published
<br>
previously on the remarkable wound-healing capacity of the MRL mouse
<br>
strain. They now turn their attention to the hardest of tissues to
<br>
heal--the myocardium.&quot; The investigators identified the cells in the injury
<br>
site of MRL mice as dividing myocytes, whereas control mice had only a
<br>
small number of dividing cells. The control mice had increased scar tissue
<br>
after injury, but the amount of scar tissue in MRL mice decreased. &quot;We
<br>
believe that the MRL mouse has the ability to block scar formation, and
<br>
under these circumstances cardiomyocytes can divide&quot;, explains Heber-Katz.
<br>
&quot;Possibly by blocking or eliminating scar formation other mammals can show
<br>
this regenerative response.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;The application of these findings to human clinical practice is still
<br>
some way off--the genes must be identified, and their action
<br>
characterised&quot;, comments Rosenthal. &quot;Still, the information gained along
<br>
the way is likely to enlighten our understanding of the regeneration
<br>
process.&quot;
