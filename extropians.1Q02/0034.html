<p>
&lt;&lt; An interesting related question is what happens when this &quot;universal constitution&quot; governing body attempts to outlaw the
<br>
production of real AI? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I suggest two things for this effect:
<br>
1) we (or another AI friendly group) should start the Federation first
<br>
2) the Federation should only impose the minimum rules (i.e. only absolutely neccessary)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From point 2, we can see that a rule to ban sentient AI would infringe it. Even a rule to ban nuclear weapons or biological weapons
</em><br>
would arguingly also infringe it. A rule to allow free trade would also not qualify (though I would like to see such a rule).
<br>
Perhaps we might not even use rules at all.
<br>
<p>It should express and enforce the basic premise of &quot;leave me alone and I will leave you alone&quot;; nothing more and nothing less. Do
<br>
remember that this treaty has to accommodate to as many possible societies as possible so that it could maximize the benefits to all
<br>
sentient life forms. If even Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, as much as most of us dislike them, chose to join the Federation
<br>
without breaking the purpose of the Federation, then I would consider it a true success.
<br>
<p><p>The Federation merely consists of a loose collection of communities bound by a very simple treaty of non-intervention. It should not
<br>
actually have to &quot;govern&quot; these communities. The United Nations, meanwhile, appears excessively obese by such standards. Again, the
<br>
Federation does *not* intend to form some organisation like the UN.
<br>
<p>If some political bodies want to kill off sentient AI, then they would have to do it with their own hands (such as by drafting their
<br>
own treaties or sending their warships). We should not allow them such a chance.
<br>
<p><p>Could someone get started with this by proposing a draft document that we can write within 2 pages for such a Federation?
