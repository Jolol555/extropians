<em>&gt;From: Natasha Vita-More &lt;<a href="mailto:natasha@natasha.cc?Subject=Re:%20Radio%20interview,%20pro-Act,%20&gt;Hist%20Politics">natasha@natasha.cc</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Subject: Your Paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hi James,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I went over your interview of me in 1998.  It seems that I did mention a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of points which were not included in your paper and which pertained
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the some topical areas of your paper.  This is quite a while ago, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stands to reason that these points could easily have been forgotten, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly didn't remember all of them.
</em><br>
<p>Did you tape it? It was my first interview, and I didn’t tape it or
<br>
transcribe it. If you have a chance, send me a copy of the tape. I’d love to
<br>
hear it for historical purposes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I am approaching a window in my schedule to address some of the issues you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represented to me and which I will take the time to think about.
</em><br>
<p>I’d love to interview you again, eventually. But as you know I’ve been
<br>
trying to get Max to agree to an interview for several years now, and he has
<br>
refused to respond to four formal requests. Perhaps you could get him to
<br>
just let me know whether he refuses to ever appear on my show or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While I appreciate your interests in politics and your enthusiasm, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you did have a definitive slant which I do believe is counter to the bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;picture here.  We do need to develop a more articulate political outlook in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order to more appropriate deal with the world at large.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I’ve had that slant since the early 1990s when I first logged into the
<br>
extrop list and acknowledged that I was a socialist, and then in 1998 when I
<br>
started Changesurfer Radio (formerly Event Horizon) as “democratic
<br>
transhumanist” radio show.
<br>
<p>As for the articulateness of the political perspective that we need to
<br>
develop, I think things are moving along nicely now that there are a growing
<br>
diversity of voices. I don’t think it makes sense to expect a single
<br>
transhumanist politics to emerge, or for &gt;Hists to reinvent the wheel.
<br>
Rather I would like to see the WTA comes to emcompass &gt;Hists with views
<br>
ranging from libertarianism (the extrops) to social democracy, and together
<br>
we can express a United Front against the Luddites and the fascists (alleged
<br>
<em>&gt;Hists and otherwise).
</em><br>
<p>I think it would be a wonderful step in this process for you to organize
<br>
Pro-Act as a &gt;Hist 501.c.4, i.e. a political lobby, and begin to do the
<br>
things that lobbys do: raise money from (especially) wealthy (but also
<br>
plebian) donors, identify &gt;Hist candidates to support (hopefully both Dem
<br>
and Rep), channel money to them, and then work the halls of Congress on
<br>
behalf of our political interests:
<br>
<p>-	More funding for scitech education and research, esp. nanotech,
<br>
silicon-neural interface, etc.
<br>
-	Stop the Luddite anti-reprotech and anti-cloning laws
<br>
-	End the Drug War
<br>
-	Fund the space program
<br>
<p>'course I'd also argue for expanding the agenda in a social justice
<br>
direction (bridging the digital divide, national health insurance to cover
<br>
high tech procedures for the poor) but I can't expect perfection...
<br>
<p>That would make a real contribution, and I suspect that you might just be
<br>
the right person to put the squeeze on a lot of rich businessmen.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>J. Hughes
