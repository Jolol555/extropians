<em>&gt; &gt; Certainly, there are poor.  It is also an undeniable fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the freest economies in the world have the fewest poor and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; richest poor.  There is so much surplus food here that the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in America are more likely to suffer from obesity than starvation;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; housing and health care are the biggest problems. It's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accident that food is almost a free market but housing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; health care are heavily regulated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So are you agreeing or denying than even in the free-market 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (relatively) of food that there are shortfalls suffered by even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some American citizens including children?
</em><br>
<p>You're getting very tiresome and evasive, Samantha.  I have /never/
<br>
denied that, I never will, and your continued insinuation that I do
<br>
is annoying, and your insistence that it is somehow the relevant
<br>
point is as well.  /Of course/ our system isn't perfect now--only
<br>
an idiot would think that.  The question is /what direction/ to
<br>
move toward to improve it.  I advocate moving toward a /freer/
<br>
market because history has shown that freer countries feed more
<br>
people.  You advocate--well, I still don't know what you advocate
<br>
because you haven't said anything meaningful on this thread about
<br>
what /you/ think the solutions are.  Until you do--until you can
<br>
show me some evidence that you have a solution /better/ than mine,
<br>
all your whining that my solution isn't perfect is empty rhetoric.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A more free economy doesn't really say much unless you say in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what ways you will do this and also in what ways you will keep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these people from very dire consequences while the changes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the economy take effect and hopefully help. 
</em><br>
<p>What a hopelessly pessimistic attitude.  The idea that people
<br>
must be forced to be compassionate has no place in Extropian
<br>
thought, and no connection with reality.  People /are/ humane
<br>
and compassionate.  People /do/ help those in need.  I utterly
<br>
reject any philosophy that denies this, and any political
<br>
system that assumes otherwise.  Mandated solutions to social
<br>
problems all assume that voluntary help won't work. But
<br>
voluntary help has worked well, works well now, and always
<br>
will, because real human beings are not generally the heartless
<br>
monsters you seem to be assuming.
