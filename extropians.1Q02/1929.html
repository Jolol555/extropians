<em>&gt; some things here go over my head,
</em><br>
<p>Chesire -- I am happy to agree with you on this point.  Particularly
<br>
with regard to Eugene's comments.  Most of the time he gets my vote
<br>
as the most obscure, condensed poster on the list (of course I can't
<br>
view myself clearly -- the recent exchange with Louis suggests that
<br>
I could very well fall into that swamp myself).  I am generally
<br>
left looking at his comments questioning whether I really understand
<br>
them -- and most of the time I think our relative knowledge bases are
<br>
pretty similar -- which makes my confusion sometimes even stranger.
<br>
I would write it off to cultural differences but I of all people on
<br>
the list have at least some overlap with Eugene's cultural background.
<br>
So the source of this remains a mystery to me.  So viewing Eugene's
<br>
comments as an enigma wrapped inside a riddle boxed within a puzzle
<br>
is not a new situation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but until now i don't think i've seen anything that i just completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't get. so. what's a GOP?
</em><br>
<p>That's easy.  G = giga or &quot;billion&quot;.  OPS = &quot;operations per second&quot;.
<br>
<p>To hang tight on the extropians list you have to learn the acronyms.
<br>
Yo gotta no gigas and teras and petas and exas and zettas and yottas
<br>
and yoctos and zeptos and attos and femtos and picos and of course
<br>
most important of all the nanos.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; slightly less important, but on a similar note, could anyone give me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a precise definition of computronium?
</em><br>
<p>Its a catch-all phrase for matter structured in a way that allows
<br>
computation.  In my experience, Robert Freitas may have invented
<br>
it.  It might have come up on the Extropian list before I first
<br>
heard it from him (I've never checked this).  Because different
<br>
computational architectures are optimal for different types of
<br>
computations (neural networks vs. cellular automata vs. quantum
<br>
qubits come to mind) there doesn't seem to be a way to specify
<br>
the &quot;best&quot; way to arrange matter to produce results in the
<br>
fastest way.  So &quot;advanced intelligences&quot; would first decide
<br>
&quot;what&quot; they want to think about, then they would decide the
<br>
&quot;optimal&quot; hardware architecture that can be used to think about
<br>
that, then they would construct (or evolve) that architecture
<br>
and build the &quot;computronium&quot; and finally do the thinking.
<br>
<p>In our current reality it would be the difference between the
<br>
Thinking Machines (now defunct) &quot;connection machines&quot;, the
<br>
GRAPE computers for gravity computations, IBM's &quot;Blue Gene&quot;
<br>
processor-in-memory pseudo-cellular-automata architecture
<br>
for protein folding (and possibly other applications) and
<br>
&quot;general purpose&quot; von Neumann/Harvard architectures (99.99...%
<br>
of what is currently available.)
<br>
<p>All of those are examples of &quot;computronium&quot;.  Each architectures
<br>
has applications for which it may be best suited.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we all create life, some of us with wombs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some with smiles, some with patient hands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are all gods, if we choose to be.
</em><br>
<p>I like to create mine with a Genome Editor and a DNA synthesizer.
