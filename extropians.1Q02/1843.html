<p>John, you need to spend a little more time browsing through
<br>
PubMed to *educate* yourself.  The evidence that adults probably
<br>
carry totipotent stem cells has been accumulating for several years.
<br>
<p>For example the date on:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11486730&amp;dopt=Abstract">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11486730&amp;dopt=Abstract</a><br>
is *March 2001* and its a *review* article meaning that people
<br>
have been accumulating evidence for quite some time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would love to see a way around the controversy of using aborted baby tissues.
</em><br>
<p>Embryonic stem cells are *not* produced from anything that
<br>
could be *remotely* considered a baby.  I strongly suspect
<br>
by the time an embryo begins to remotely take on a human form,
<br>
most of the cells have lost all ability to be &quot;totipotent&quot;.
<br>
In fact, I don't believe that any of the current embryonic stem cell
<br>
lines were produced from aborted tissue at all!  I believe they
<br>
were manufactured in the lab directly from fertilized eggs.
<br>
<p>I'll agree that the article is good news, since the results
<br>
seem to be quite reproducible.
<br>
<p>But you *missed* the most interesting part of the article:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, Verfaillie's group has done the tests that are perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the gold standard in assessing a cell's plasticity. She placed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single MAPCs from humans and mice into very early mouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embryos, when they are just a ball of cells. Analyses of mice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born after the experiment reveal that a single MAPC can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute to all the body's tissues. 
</em><br>
<p>If this is written accurately, then it means that human-mouse
<br>
chimeras have been produced.  Now *that* I find interesting
<br>
because I was unaware of it.  But thinking about it, it would
<br>
seem to me that someone must have done this before.  Does anyone
<br>
know how far you can push it (10:1, 5:1, 1:1 Mouse:Human ratio)
<br>
and what happens when you do?
<br>
<p>Robert
