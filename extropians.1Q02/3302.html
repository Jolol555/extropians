<DIV></DIV>
<P>The article focuses specificly on infertility &amp; the development of exowombs.Most of the replies posted so far also share this focus, but I'm not quite sure why. I think exowombs are a remarkable scientific achievement, but I wonder about some much more interesting possibilities for this technology (ie- possible applications in space colonization?) I'm not too scientifically knowledgable, so perhaps you all can help me out: Why is this fertility issue being pushed? Why does the development of this technology have to be contextualized, so limited only to the area of fertility? Is it because science can make money out of it this way? Is it all about the money? Or are scientists aware that the only way they can make any real progress with this controversial technology IS to have a market for it? Is the fertility thing just a cover, a means to an end? I'd be really interested&nbsp;to hear some fresh ideas from others on the list.<BR></P>
<P>I guess my whole gripe with the fertility issue goes back to a global population concern. Well okay maybe it really goes back even further to a local population concern. I returned to the city where I was raised this week to visit my&nbsp;family.&nbsp;Even though I've only been in the "country" (rural NW Mass.)&nbsp;for 2 months, I was shell shocked when I returned to Providence. Its not that its a big city by any means&nbsp;- its actually&nbsp;very&nbsp;tiny (size, buildings, etc.) but there are just SO many people everywhere, its suffocating. RI is the 2nd most densely populated state in the US&nbsp;and also the smallest geographically (*not a good combination). I remember it being pretty bad before, which is why I left. But you don't realize or you forget how crowded it is when you live there because you&nbsp;simply get used to it. And its only gotten worse.&nbsp;Going back after 5 years, I realized that it is NOT something I want to have to "get used to."<BR></P>
<P>Here's a link from a quick google that comes from the US census bureau -&nbsp;"Total Midyear Population for the World: 1950-2050"&nbsp; <A href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html">http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html</A></P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>This says the current world population is 6.2 billion. While the growth rate is projected to decrease steadily, the total population is nevertheless expected to reach 7 billion by the year 2013, 8 billion by 2028, and 9 billion by 2048. I don't know what the planet's maximum capacity is (maybe we already passed it?) but even still, to me&nbsp;these figures look rather... yuckie.</P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>I don't know much about population trends but I'm really curious &amp; (as with everything else) I have lots of questions: How do they formulate global population projections? What variables do they consider? Does this take into account the rapid progress of technology &amp; its possible implications for humanity? For these reasons, I cannot&nbsp;speak&nbsp;to&nbsp;the validity of this source&nbsp;- I simply do not know. I haven't had time to really research this yet.&nbsp;So if anyone can provide some good information or statistics I would really appreciate it.</P>

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Subject: AGING: perhaps we are over the hump 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Date: Sat, 16 Feb 2002 08:05:41 -0800 (PST) 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV> 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The list has previously discussed the possibility that we 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;may get to the point where medical technology may be extending 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the average lifespan at a rate of greater than one year per year. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;This is in contrast to the ~0.25 year/year of the last century 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in developed countries. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV> 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV> 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;....... 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I'd be very surprised if the specific gene isn't pulled out within 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the next year. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Now, given the genetic technologies I expect will develop within 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this decade, there is a reasonable chance that we will be able 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to give everyone the benefits of the Methuselah gene. If so 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;we will be bumping average longevity from ~75 to ~90 within 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this decade, or ~15 years / decade. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If that proves to be the case, then the expected longevity of 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;everyone on the list under the age of ~65 just became *much* 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;greater! 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Okay so if the global population is already projected to fly off the charts, AND we have all this wonderful scientific progress in fertility (on a planet that's already too densely populated), AND our life expectancy is predicted to increase continuously, couldn't this be a problem? So&nbsp;if there are more babies in addition to longer lifespans, wouldn't the population density be even higher?&nbsp; Does anyone else&nbsp;see a problem with this? To be honest, it kind of scares me -&nbsp;I get anxiety attacks just going out to the shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon. Too many people!!!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm all for the prospect of&nbsp;an extended human lifespan. But it makes me&nbsp;crazy to think about people spending so much time, energy &amp; money on&nbsp;making their "own" biological child when there are so many children already here (for adoption)&nbsp;that need homes &amp; loving families. To me, this whole compulsion of biological heredity is irrational. Why are we&nbsp;investing so much energy trying to make more people - we already have too many! Why not spend more time improving&nbsp;the quality of life for the ones&nbsp;who are already here?&nbsp;I realize I might be missing something here - perhaps its because I'm much&nbsp;too young &amp; I don't have children, but I just don't understand. I'm probably way off the mark with this one so I'm already prepared to get chewed out&nbsp; :P</DIV>
