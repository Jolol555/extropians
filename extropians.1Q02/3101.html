<em>&gt; None of this, in my mind, recently enriched by reading PhD theses of

</em><br>
<p><p>In relation to &quot;intelligence&quot; in its purest and most universal form, goals
<br>
are essentially external bias sources that generate gradients for doing work
<br>
in the same way enthalpy gradients can drive work in the physical world.
<br>
Biological intelligence comes with a number of bias sources wired into the
<br>
intelligence engine by default.  While it would be a complex analysis, I
<br>
think that a cursory inspection indicates that all the goals of humans are
<br>
really subgoals of the external biases that come with the hardware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this perspective, AI doesn't need to do anything at all and probably
</em><br>
couldn't, beyond acting as an efficient recording device perhaps.
<br>
Externally biasing the AI structure (e.g. a command from a prompt) would be
<br>
the primary way of extracting intelligent behavior, and you would get the
<br>
same level of intelligence from an unmotivated AI as you would an equivalent
<br>
one with a constant source of bias.  Where this could become interesting is
<br>
devising a permanent bias source for an AI structure that actually gives the
<br>
results the designer intends.  There is a good argument to be made that a
<br>
constantly biased AI engine will do far more interesting things in the long
<br>
run (and do more &quot;AI-ish&quot; things as most people imagine it) at a level of
<br>
efficiency that could be higher than an unbiased AI.  However, designing
<br>
high quality bias sources into an AI in practice does not appear to be a
<br>
trivial problem and one can easily imagine all sorts of Faustian unintended
<br>
consequences resulting from &quot;auto-biasing&quot; intelligence.  It certainly has
<br>
provided plenty of fodder for SF books.
<br>
<p>I think it might be perfectly valid to classify AI as either &quot;externally
<br>
biased&quot; or &quot;internally biased&quot; depending on how the biasing mechanisms are
<br>
wired into the general intelligence engine.  I can also imagine the
<br>
political and legal fallout in a useless attempt to regulate specific
<br>
capabilities in this vein.
