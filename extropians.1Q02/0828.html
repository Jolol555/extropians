Gene Roddenbury was not above recycling his own ideas. The Neitzscheans seem 
<br>
to be a re-do of the supermen and women, who were part of the Botany Bay 
<br>
episode on Star Trek (1967), as well as Star Trek ll - The Wrath of Khan (in 
<br>
rich corinthean leather!).
<br>
<p>Or even the Borg (the ultimate computer user), who had uber powers and such. 
<br>
It easy to make 'modified people, the fall guy, the heavy, in a tv series; 
<br>
because its dramtic and cheap.  Nice Borgs, friendly Neitszcheans, might make 
<br>
a great 
<br>
Friends 2060 episode, but it ain't dramatic.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, all the comic book heroes have uber powers and are quite 
<br>
popular, and religious myth figures who performed miracles have received tons 
<br>
of good press (go figure).
<br>
<p><p>Notice in Real Life attempts at augmentation for certain medical advances in 
<br>
the artificial heart, for instance have made Barney Clark and Robert Tool 
<br>
into heroes. The press has focused positively, on people with Ventricular 
<br>
Assist Devices also. It seems to me that genuine advances seem to bring 
<br>
genuine approval.
<br>
<p>Dr. Finney observed:
<br>
&lt;&lt;They do have a &quot;good&quot; Nietzschean on board the Andromeda, Tyr Anasazi,
<br>
who helps defend the ship and gets along reasonably well with the crew.
<br>
However he is an ambiguous character and the writers don't try to soften
<br>
his Nietzschean attitudes much.  He makes it clear that he is on the
<br>
Andromeda to further his own interests in survival and power.  There is
<br>
a sense that if the opportunity presented itself he would betray the
<br>
crew without a second thought if it was to his own advantage.&gt;&gt;
