Serafino,
<br>
<p>What you present here, between Einstein and Bohr, looks to me as
<br>
another example of a Bayesian versus a non-Bayesian point of view in
<br>
science. In particular, the difference between our knowledge of
<br>
reality, and reality itself.
<br>
<p>The Copenhagen interpretation is a muddy mess. No wonder I didn't
<br>
understand it well in college, and it still bothers me now. Quantum
<br>
theory is successful, but, as Feynman says: &quot;Nobody knows how it can
<br>
be that way.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let's try to look at quantum physics from a Bayesian point of view.
<br>
<p>I'm following Edwin Jaynes' writings, BTW:

<p>Einstein was looking at the realities of nature, describing at an
<br>
*ontological* level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;At that time Bohr has already developed his 'complementarity'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heisenberg (and perhaps also Bohr) thought that the 'general'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complementarity principle and his 'special' uncertainty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle had something to do with the concept of 'information'.
</em><br>
<p>And Bohr was thinking on the *epistemological* level, not describing
<br>
reality but, instead, information about reality.
<br>
<p>Bohr said: &quot;There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract
<br>
quantum physical description. It is wrong to think that the task of
<br>
physics is to find out how nature _is_. Physics concerns what we can
<br>
say about nature.&quot;
<br>
<p>Difficult to untangle, hmm? In his statement, he is stressing the
<br>
information processing aspect of science. Although Einstein and many
<br>
physicists would disagree with him and say that science is about
<br>
learning what is reality, and what are its 'laws', Bohr is pointing
<br>
out that any theory about reality can have no consequences testable
<br>
by us, unless that theory can also describe what humans can see and
<br>
know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Against Einstein's objection, Heisenberg and Dirac and Pauli
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emphasized that the 'wave function' did not represent a course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of events in space and time, but it did rather express just our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'knowledge' of the events. Einstein did not agree.
</em><br>
<p>Neither Einstein nor Bohr was wrong. They were each describing a
<br>
different aspect of the problem.
<br>
<p>If one incorporates human information into science, i.e. the
<br>
original &quot;logical inference&quot; as described long ago by Bernoulli and
<br>
Laplace, the quantum mechanical mud becomes clearer. For example, the
<br>
quantum mechanical probabilities involved in the EPR scenario became
<br>
Bayesian probabilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But that is not the end of my story. It's interesting to note
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Heisenberg (but not Bohr) believed that the 'collapse' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 'wave packet' (thus also those 'spooky' actions) was _indeed_
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a physical action, triggered by the 'indivisibility' of the particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory, Un. Chicago P.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;page 39). Was he right ? It seems so.
</em><br>
<p>This is so muddy!
<br>
<p>Here Heisenberg is mixing up realities of Nature, with incomplete human
<br>
information about Nature.
<br>
<p>argggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!
