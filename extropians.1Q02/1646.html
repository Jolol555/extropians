<p><em>&gt; Argument For Autism as a Genetic 'Epidemic'

<em>&gt;      &quot;Have the airplane and the computer changed the architecture of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<p>Wow!  Great article, thanks Chen!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      This is not to say that all computer-scientists lack social skill. Far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from it. We all know computer-scientists who are good socializers. Nor is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say that those severely affected by autism could suddenly shift and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become a successful programmer. But those who had a dash of autism could.
</em><br>
<p>I find this to be the hardest part of being a nerd.  Everyone expects
<br>
you to be good with computers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     No longer the socially isolated, unemployed, &quot;weird&quot; guy who could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list every prime number up to 10,000 in minutes, but who couldn't have even

</em><br>
<p>Hes going to the wrong parties.  I was at a Mersenne prime party last
<br>
month.  Girls at that party would have been impressed by the recitation,
<br>
as would I, being as there are 1129 such numbers, depending on whether
<br>
you count one as the first prime or the zeroeth prime.
<br>
<p>We had quite an argument over this at the Mersenne party.  A prime
<br>
is a number whose only factors are itself and one.  But in the case
<br>
of one, one itself is itself itself.  So I proposed referring to 2 as the first
<br>
prime and one as the &quot;prime prime&quot;.  Or if you are French and like
<br>
to switch your noun and adjective, then it would be the &quot;prime prime.&quot;
<br>
It gets very Hofstadterian.
<br>
<p>But I digress.  The solution would be to find a geek girl who loves primes,
<br>
then recite away.  Of course these are rare and highly valued women.
<br>
At the Mersenne party there were only two women and I am married
<br>
to one of them.  The other one looked like she was seriously trying to
<br>
decide if this particular salary she was married to was worth having
<br>
to attend such dweebfests.  spike
