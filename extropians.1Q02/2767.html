<em>&gt; The key to fast reading of screen-rendered text is in the scrolling. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;page&quot; at a time is far too much for our meager visual cortex to handle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other speed-reading techniques require more motor control, such as your

</em><br>
<p>I don't think manual scrolling is compatible with fast, effortless
<br>
reading. All moving of the text brings effort to the brain (mine at
<br>
least). It is not the moving of the eye which is an effort, the effort
<br>
is not muscular, it is computational.
<br>
<p>Automatic scrolling is even worse, as the speed at which you read must
<br>
of course adapt to what you're reading. When you get to the middle of
<br>
a paragraph and you got the idea and you predict that nothing will be
<br>
added in the rest, you go to the next paragraph.
<br>
<p>You need the page to stand still if you are to move fast and
<br>
comfortably.
<br>
<p>I suspect that the automatic scrolling thing is adapted to people for
<br>
whom reading means reading aloud without the sound and listening to
<br>
the sounds they don't make with their inner ear :-)
<br>
<p>Funn(nnnn)ily, reading is one of those things which is actually not
<br>
taught. Children are taught to read aloud, and then left to figure out
<br>
how to read for themselves. Some find good ways to do it, other don't.
<br>
Among the latter, some only learn to switch off the sound. Some
<br>
stumble later on a &quot;fast reading&quot; book. It's all left to improvisation
<br>
and chance.
<br>
<p>That's how teaching now &quot;works&quot; : you test children again and again,
<br>
until they figure out a way to pass the test ; you actually never
<br>
teach them THAT, and some never learn. The only thing that should be
<br>
taught is left to complete improvisation, and that accounts for huge
<br>
differences between individuals, because some find great tricks and
<br>
meta-tricks with which the readily build feats of cognition, and some
<br>
are stuck with unefficient tricks.
<br>
<p>A teacher should model his pupil's mind and actually help it to build
<br>
itself further. He should suggest useful tricks for the pupil to try,
<br>
adopt and combine.
