This one is *really* greep-crottling (but the p values aren't that
<br>
enthralling).
<br>
<p>===========
<br>
[a guy sez:]
<br>
Leonard Leibovici, a professor of medicine at the Rabin Medical Center
<br>
decided to
<br>
explore whether it was possible to reach back from the future, into the
<br>
past and, using
<br>
Therapeutic Intent(TI)/prayer, to effect clinical outcomes of patients with
<br>
a severe blood
<br>
infection. The results, published in the Christmas 2001 number of the
<br>
prestigious British
<br>
Medical Journal (BMJ) are as challenging and provocative as any in medicine. 
<br>
<p>In addition to using well-established procedures of randomization and
<br>
double-blind,
<br>
Leibovici avoided any charge that he selected his patients to produce a
<br>
desired result by
<br>
simply taking all of them -- &quot;all adult patents - 3,392 of them -- whose
<br>
bloodstream
<br>
infection was detected&quot; at the Rabin Center in Israel during a four year
<br>
period between
<br>
1990 and 1996. &quot;Bloodstream infection was defined as a positive blood
<br>
culture (not
<br>
resulting from contamination) in the presences of sepsis.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The patients were sorted into two population groups using a random number
<br>
generator.
<br>
And three primary outcomes were compared: &quot;&quot;the number of deaths in
<br>
hospital, length
<br>
of stay in hospital from the date of the first positive blood culture to
<br>
discharge or death,
<br>
and duration of fever. 
<br>
<p>TI Practitioners were given only a list of the patient’s first names and
<br>
were asked to say
<br>
&quot;a short prayer for the well being and full recovery of the group as a
<br>
whole.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Leibovici, says: &quot;We cannot assume a priori that time is linear, as we
<br>
perceive it, or that
<br>
God is limited by a linear time, as we are, the intervention was carried
<br>
out 4-10 years
<br>
after the patient’s infection and hospitalization. The hypothesis was the
<br>
remote
<br>
retroactive intercessory prayer reduces mortality and shortens the length
<br>
of stay in
<br>
hospital and duration of fever.&quot; The results challenge our understanding of
<br>
reality:
<br>
&quot;Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer said for a group is associated
<br>
with a shorter stay
<br>
in hospital and shorter duration of fever in patients with a bloodstream
<br>
infection and
<br>
should be considered for use in clinical practice.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
<p><p>Main outcome measures: Mortality in hospital, length of stay in hospital,
<br>
and duration of fever. 
<br>
Results: Mortality was 28.1% (475/1691) in the intervention group and 30.2%
<br>
(514/1702) in the control
<br>
group (P for difference=0.4). Length of stay in hospital and duration of
<br>
fever were significantly shorter in
<br>
the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.01 and P=0.04,
<br>
respectively). 
<br>
<p>Conclusions: Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer said for a group is
<br>
associated with a shorter stay in
<br>
hospital and shorter duration of fever in patients with a bloodstream
<br>
infection and should be considered
<br>
for use in clinical practice. 
<br>
<p>........................
<br>
Innnnteresting. (Even if this holds up, I think we can edit *gods* out of
<br>
the equation.)
