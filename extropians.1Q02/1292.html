<br>
<p><em>&gt;In an ideal world, yes.  Practically speaking &quot;sex&quot;, with or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without actual physical contact, would be highly disruptive to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frontline combat unit.  That may change over time.  But frankly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by the time most people change the way they view and control their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;male/female sexual  relationships, we'll be far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologically advanced.  Warfare itself will have changed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making the close association of men and women on the battlefield
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less an issue.  There are strong trends today towards making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual soldier much more autonomous, much more mobile, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much more capable.  Wireless technologies, augmented reality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smart munitions, even things like exoskeletons, Solo-Trek and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Segway technologies will dramatically change infantry combat. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hell, that's certainly one of the things Heinlein foresaw so long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago with the Mobile Infantry.  Individual soldiers miles and miles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apart capable of great levels of destruction.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We're not far from that.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Another darn good post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I spent mid '76 to mid 78 with VMA(AW)533 at Cherry Point N.C 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and mid '78 to mid 79 with VMA(AW)224 in Iwakuni Japan. (MOS 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 6637) 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Swing with the wing.  :)
</em><br>
<p>A-6 Intruders, we penetrate deeper, linger longer, and drop a
<br>
bigger load... ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Okay, lets play with the concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We segregate men and women in the military now to avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consequences of potentially complicating sexual encounters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Now if we are to be fair and permit gays and lesbians to serve,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; where are you going to put them?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It isn't fair to put the Gays with the &quot;straights&quot;, or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Lesbians  with the &quot;Straights&quot; and you can't put Gays with Gays,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and Lesbians with Lesbians for the same reasons!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Ball in your court...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Hey, I never said I had all the answers.  I don't know.  I'm glad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't have to deal with that particular issue in a frontline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combat unit. The leadership challenges required to keep a lid on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things and accomplish the mission would be monumental.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needs to be some major cultural shifts before it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accomplished without major degradation of combat effectiveness. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But again, I think that in the next ten to twenty years the face
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of individual combat will have changed so dramatically as to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it a moot point.  The main issue is what happens in the near term,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I don't know how you're going to overcome the cultural biases
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and prejudices that make it a highly divisive issue. And divisive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues make for poor unit cohesion and esprit.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
No you didn't and I don't either.
<br>
<p>But what you did do was to very clearly and honestly outline some
<br>
of the problems and their potential consequences, and did a great
<br>
job of it.
<br>
<p>Having a new articulate opinion to consider is always a big help.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Well, sure.  The Navy is integrated.  The Air Force is or almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is, and the Army is a lot more integrated than the Marines. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Desert Storm was an interesting experiment.  And the reports
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weren't all that good, though I haven't seen any scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evaluations of the problems.  Lots of pregnancies resulted in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lot of women being taken out of operational positions because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couldn't perform.  That in itself created problems among the men
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who had to stay and take up the slack.  But if they're as good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking as those Canadian soldiers James was talking about, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely.  :)
</em><br>
<p>Here! Here!
