<p><em>&gt;To make it even harder -- answer the question --

<em>&gt;When you make an error copying DNA, such that you 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;does the repair machinery know *which* strand is wrong?
</em><br>
<p>The new strand isn't yet properly methylated.  
<br>
Repair enyzmes can alter the unmethylated strand
<br>
before the methlation-copying enzymes get to it.
<br>
(Not to exclude other ID methods unknown to me or
<br>
even humanity in general, at present)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The real mystery to me is why efficiency 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is seemingly not a factor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and why junk DNA is allowed to proliferate.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Copying it is relatively cheap 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compared to the cost of deleting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it and getting it wrong.  
</em><br>
<p>Right; DNA is only about 2% of dry weight.
<br>
The extra energetic costs are small, and to
<br>
fix it requires millions of advantageous mutations
<br>
(one to ditch each piece of junk.)  So the per
<br>
fix advantage is very small - 1 x 10^-8 or so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transposons allow easy duplication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of DNA that can subsequently evolved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for extended uses retaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them in the genome allows faster 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution and probably selects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for their retention.
</em><br>
<p>Transposons select for their own retention.
<br>
There's millions of them in your genome, 
<br>
probably hundred of active ones, all evolving
<br>
against control mechanisms, plus others dropping
<br>
in from time to time from other species or
<br>
from retroviruses.  It's like asking why we're
<br>
not immune to viruses, really.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Better questions are whether transposon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activation is keyed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stress as the SOS response is in bacteria 
</em><br>
<p>Maybe.  Theory suggest they should only replicate
<br>
in germ-cell lines, which is rather different from
<br>
stress.  It's a plausible hypothesis of mine that
<br>
increased sexual activity will rev up accidental
<br>
non-germline transposon activity and this is a model
<br>
for the inverse relationship between sexual activity
<br>
and lifespan and possibly the CR effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and how pufferfish (Fugu)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have managed to keep the junk DNA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so low (they only have a 400 MBP
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genome which is very small for a vertebrate)?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's a doozy!  And they did it by making
<br>
each stretch of junk smaller, but retaining (roughly)
<br>
the # of introns per gene.  There's a guy here in
<br>
UC Riverside working on that a little - but he says
<br>
it's very hard because aligning the introns with 
<br>
relatives is very ambiguous.
