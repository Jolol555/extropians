(This is an interesting article about the Sanctions against IRAQ.  Opponents
<br>
of the sanctions site an often heard statement that these sanctions have led
<br>
to the death of over 1,000,000 children.  Osama Bin Laden in his 10/7
<br>
videotaped message stated that every day US sanctions cause the death of
<br>
5,000 Iraqi children under the age of 5.  Proponents of the sanctions assert
<br>
that these numbers are greatly exaggerated, if not outright lies.  The truth
<br>
seems to lie somewhere in the middle.  The original figure came from a five
<br>
study 700 household study in Iraq performed by Iraq's officials.  Even
<br>
Iraq's own official web site shows the number to be 3,000 per month.
<br>
Interestingly, the sanctions apply to all of Iraq yet the northern part of
<br>
Iraq is not under Saddam's control, only the southern part is.  Yet the
<br>
under 5 death rates in the south are double that of the north, and the
<br>
northern rates have been decreasing.  It seems that how the government
<br>
operates may also have a significant impact on these figures.  The author
<br>
also asks &quot;How much should we blame Saddam Hussein for rejecting the U.N.'s
<br>
&quot;oil-for-food&quot; humanitarian offer for six years&quot;  A later UNIFEC study
<br>
showed a more reliable figure, in both north and south, to be about 100,000
<br>
since 1990.  It is important not to trivialize these deaths, and it is
<br>
obvious that a significant number of deaths have come from the sanctions.
<br>
But it is important to know the facts and the real numbers, and acknowledge
<br>
that this countries own corrupt despotic government shares some of the blame
<br>
for these deaths.  The author continues &quot;Yet the basic argument against all
<br>
economic sanctions remains: namely, that they tend to punish civilians more
<br>
than governments and to provide dictators with a gift-wrapped propaganda
<br>
tool.&quot; and &quot;It seems awfully hard not to conclude that the embargo on Iraq
<br>
has been ineffective (especially since 1998) and that it has, at the least,
<br>
contributed to more than 100,000 deaths since 1990. With Bush set to go to
<br>
war over Saddam's noncompliance with the military goals of the sanctions,
<br>
there has never been a more urgent time to confront the issue with clarity.

<p>The Politics of Dead Children
<br>
<p>Have sanctions against Iraq murdered millions?
<br>
<p>By Matt Welch
<br>
<p><p><p>Are &quot;a million innocent children...dying at this time...in Iraq&quot; because of
<br>
U.S. sanctions, as Osama bin Laden claimed in his October 7 videotaped
<br>
message to the world? Has the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund
<br>
(UNICEF) discovered that &quot;at least 200 children are dying every day...as a
<br>
direct result of sanctions,&quot; as advocacy journalist John Pilger maintains on
<br>
his Web site? Is it official U.N. belief that 5,000 Iraqi children under the
<br>
age of 5 are dying each month due to its own policy, as writers of letters
<br>
to virtually every U.S. newspaper have stated repeatedly during the past
<br>
three years?
<br>
<p>The short answer to all of these questions is no. The sanctions, first
<br>
imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, are administered by the
<br>
U.N., not the U.S. They were first imposed on all exports from Iraq and
<br>
occupied Kuwait, and all non-humanitarian imports, in an effort to persuade
<br>
Saddam Hussein to retreat within his own borders. After the Gulf War, they
<br>
were broadened to include a dismantling of Iraq's biological, chemical,
<br>
nuclear, and missile-based weapons systems, out of fear that Hussein would
<br>
otherwise lash out again. Estimates of sanctions-era &quot;excess&quot; child deaths
<br>
-- the number above the normal mortality rate -- vary widely due to politics
<br>
and inadequate data, especially concerning children older than 5. The
<br>
dictatorial Iraqi government, which has blamed nearly every civilian funeral
<br>
since 1991 on sanctions, claims there have been more than 600,000 deaths of
<br>
under-5-year-olds these past 11 years (4,500 per month) and 1.5 million
<br>
deaths overall.
<br>
<p>While firefighters were still pulling out warm body parts from Ground Zero,
<br>
foreign policy critic Noam Chomsky and his followers on college campuses and
<br>
alternative-weekly staffs nationwide were insisting that it was vital to
<br>
understand the &quot;context&quot; of the September 11 massacre: that U.S.-led
<br>
sanctions were killing &quot;5,000 children a month&quot; in Iraq. Meanwhile, on the
<br>
Iraqi government's own Web site, the number of under-5 deaths from all
<br>
causes for the month of September was listed as 2,932. 
<br>
<p>Arriving at a reliable raw number of dead people is hard enough; assigning
<br>
responsibility for the ongoing tragedy borders on the purely speculative.
<br>
Competing factors include sanctions, drought, hospital policy,
<br>
breast-feeding education, Saddam Hussein's government, depressed oil prices,
<br>
the Iraqi economy's almost total dependence on oil exports and food imports,
<br>
destruction from the Iran-Iraq and Persian Gulf wars, differences in
<br>
conditions between the autonomous north and the Saddam-controlled south, and
<br>
a dozen other variables difficult to measure without direct independent
<br>
access to the country. 
<br>
<p>Confusing the issue still further are basic questions about the sanctions
<br>
themselves. Should the U.N. impose multilateral economic sanctions to keep a
<br>
proven tyrant from developing weapons to launch more wars against his
<br>
neighbors? If sanctions are inherently immoral, what other tools short of
<br>
war can the international community use? Is this particular sanctions regime
<br>
more unreasonable than others that haven't triggered humanitarian crises?
<br>
How much should we blame Saddam Hussein for rejecting the U.N.'s
<br>
&quot;oil-for-food&quot; humanitarian offer for six years, and expelling weapons
<br>
inspectors in 1998? Most important, has Iraq made headway since then in
<br>
pursuing nuclear and biological weapons?
<br>
<p>Yet all this murkiness has not deterred advocates of sanctions from claiming
<br>
absolute certainty on the issue. The warmongering New Republic, for example,
<br>
announced in October that the notion that &quot;sanctions have caused widespread
<br>
suffering&quot; was simply &quot;false.&quot; Writing in National Review in December,
<br>
former army intelligence analyst Robert Stewart asserted that &quot;resources are
<br>
available in Iraq. Even under the sanctions, Iraq's people need not starve.&quot;
<br>
<p>The chasm between claims made by sanction supporters and opponents is enough
<br>
to make inquisitive people throw their hands up in the air. Such despair is
<br>
not exactly conducive to healthy debate, which is especially important at a
<br>
time when President Bush has made it clear that Iraq must cooperate with
<br>
weapons inspection or become the next target of the War on Terrorism. A
<br>
closer look at the controversy over dead Iraqi babies shows that opponents
<br>
of sanctions have a compelling case to make. Although they often undermine
<br>
their own position with outrageous exaggerations, their critics show a
<br>
similar disregard for the facts when they blithely dismiss concerns about
<br>
the impact of sanctions on innocent people.
<br>
<p><p>Origins of a Whopper
<br>
<p>The idea that sanctions in Iraq have killed half a million children (or 1
<br>
million, or 1.5 million, depending on the hysteria of the source) took root
<br>
in 1995 and 1996, on the basis of two transparently flawed studies, one
<br>
inexplicable doubling of the studies' statistics, and a non-denial on 60
<br>
Minutes.
<br>
<p>In August 1995, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) gave
<br>
officials from the Iraqi Ministry of Health a questionnaire on child
<br>
mortality and asked them to conduct a survey in the capital city of Baghdad.
<br>
On the basis of this five-day, 693-household, Iraq-controlled study, the FAO
<br>
announced in November that &quot;child mortality had increased nearly five fold&quot;
<br>
since the pre-sanctions era. As embargo critic Richard Garfield, a public
<br>
health specialist at Columbia University, wrote in his own comprehensive
<br>
1999 survey of under-5 deaths in Iraq, &quot;The 1995 study's conclusions were
<br>
subsequently withdrawn by the authors....Notwithstanding the retraction of
<br>
the original data, their estimate of more than 500,000 excess child deaths
<br>
due to the embargo is still often repeated by sanctions critics.&quot;
<br>
<p>In March 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its own report
<br>
on the humanitarian crisis. It reprinted figures -- provided solely by the
<br>
Iraqi Ministry of Health -- showing that a total of 186,000 children under
<br>
the age of 5 died between 1990 and 1994 in the 15 Saddam-governed provinces.
<br>
According to these government figures, the number of deaths jumped nearly
<br>
500 percent, from 8,903 in 1990 to 52,905 in 1994.
<br>
<p>Somehow, based largely on these two reports -- a five-day study in Baghdad
<br>
showing a &quot;five fold&quot; increase in child deaths and a Ministry of Health
<br>
claim that a total of 186,000 children under 5 had died from all causes
<br>
between 1990 and 1994 -- a New York-based advocacy group called the Center
<br>
for Economic and Social Rights (CESR) concluded in a May 1996 survey that
<br>
&quot;these mortality rates translate into a figure of over half a million excess
<br>
child deaths as a result of sanctions.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In addition to doubling the Iraqi government's highest number and
<br>
attributing all deaths to the embargo, CESR suggested a comparison that
<br>
proved popular among the growing legions of sanctions critics: &quot;In simple
<br>
terms, more Iraqi children have died as a result of sanctions than the
<br>
combined toll of two atomic bombs on Japan.&quot; The word genocide started
<br>
making its way into the discussion.
<br>
<p>Still, the report might well have ended up in the dustbin of bad mathematics
<br>
had a CESR fact-finding tour of Iraq not been filmed by Lesley Stahl of 60
<br>
Minutes. In a May 12, 1996, report that later won her an Emmy and an Alfred
<br>
I. DuPont-Columbia University Journalism Award, Stahl used CESR's faulty
<br>
numbers and atomic-bomb imagery to confront Madeleine Albright, then the
<br>
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. &quot;We have heard that a half million
<br>
children have died,&quot; Stahl said. &quot;I mean, that's more children than died in
<br>
Hiroshima. And -- and you know, is the price worth it?&quot; Albright replied, &quot;I
<br>
think this is a very hard choice, but the price -- we think the price is
<br>
worth it.&quot;
<br>
<p>It was the non-denial heard 'round the world. In the hands of sanctions
<br>
opponents and foreign policy critics, it was portrayed as a confession of
<br>
fact, even though neither Albright nor the U.S. government has ever admitted
<br>
to such a ghastly number (nor had anybody aside from CESR and Lesley Stahl
<br>
ever suggested such a thing until May 1996). The 60 Minutes exchange is very
<br>
familiar to readers of Arab newspapers, college dailies, and liberal
<br>
journals of opinion. Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan mentioned it several times
<br>
during their respective presidential campaigns. 
<br>
<p>After September 11, the anecdote received new life, as in this typically
<br>
imaginative interpretation by Harper's Editor Lewis Lapham in the magazine's
<br>
November issue: &quot;When Madeleine Albright, then the American secretary of
<br>
state [sic], was asked in an interview on 60 Minutes whether she had
<br>
considered the resulting death of 500,000 Iraqi children (of malnutrition
<br>
and disease), she said, 'We think the price is worth it.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Albright has been dogged by protesters at nearly all her campus appearances
<br>
the past several years, and rightly so: It was a beastly thing to say, and
<br>
she should have refuted the figures. Quietly, a month after the World Trade
<br>
Center attack, she finally apologized for her infamous performance. &quot;I
<br>
shouldn't have said it,&quot; she said during a speech at the University of
<br>
Southern California. &quot;You can believe this or not, but my comments were
<br>
taken out of context.&quot;
<br>
<p>The other, far more credible source of the 500,000 number is a pair of 1999
<br>
UNICEF studies that estimated the under-5 mortality rates of both Iraqi
<br>
regions based on interviews with a total of 40,000 households. &quot;If the
<br>
substantial reduction in the under-five mortality rate during the 1980s had
<br>
continued through the 1990s,&quot; the report concluded, &quot;there would have been
<br>
half a million fewer deaths of children under-five in the country as a whole
<br>
during the eight year period 1991 to 1998.&quot; If the expected mortality rate
<br>
had stayed level rather than continuing its downward slope, the excess death
<br>
number would be more like 420,000.
<br>
<p>Significantly, UNICEF found child mortality actually decreased in the
<br>
autonomous north (from 80.2 per 100,000 in 1984-89 to 70.8 in 1994-98) while
<br>
more than doubling in the south (from 56 per 100,000 to 130.6). This is
<br>
Exhibit A for those who, like The New Republic, argue that Saddam alone is
<br>
responsible for Iraq's humanitarian crisis. When the report was released,
<br>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy attributed the difference in
<br>
mortality trends to &quot;the large amount of international aid pumped into
<br>
northern Iraq at the end of the [Persian Gulf] war.&quot;
<br>
<p>The UNICEF report took pains to spread the blame for increased mortality in
<br>
the south, mentioning factors such as a dramatic increase in the bottle-only
<br>
feeding of infants in place of more nutritious (and less likely to be
<br>
tainted) breast milk. &quot;It's very important not to just say that everything
<br>
rests on sanctions,&quot; Bellamy said in a subsequent interview. &quot;It is also the
<br>
result of wars and the reduction in investment in resources for primary
<br>
health care.&quot;
<br>
<p>But in the hands of sanctions opponents and some news organizations, these
<br>
findings were translated into a U.N. admission that sanctions were &quot;directly
<br>
responsible&quot; for killing half a million children (or even &quot;infants&quot;). In
<br>
September 2001 alone, the UNICEF report was mischaracterized in The Boston
<br>
Globe, The Buffalo News, The Akron Beacon Journal, The San Diego
<br>
Union-Tribune, The Charleston Gazette, the Wilmington Sunday Star-News, and
<br>
The Chicago Tribune (by a Northwestern University journalism professor, no
<br>
less).
<br>
<p>By November, UNICEF was annoyed enough with the frequent misinterpretations
<br>
to send out regular corrective press releases, saying things like: &quot;The
<br>
surveys were never intended to provide an absolute figure of how many
<br>
children have died in Iraq as a result of sanctions.&quot; Rather, they &quot;show
<br>
that if the substantial reductions in child mortality in Iraq during the
<br>
1980s had continued through the 1990s -- in other words if there hadn't been
<br>
two wars, if sanctions hadn't been introduced and if investment in social
<br>
services had been maintained -- there would have been 500,000 fewer deaths
<br>
of children under five.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sanctions critics almost always leave out one other salient fact: The vast
<br>
majority of the horror stats they quote apply to the period before March
<br>
1997, when the oil-for-food program delivered its first boatload of supplies
<br>
(nearly six years after the U.N. first proposed the idea to a reluctant
<br>
Iraqi government). In the past four years of oil-for-food, Iraq has exported
<br>
around 3 billion barrels of oil, generating $40 billion in revenue, which
<br>
has resulted in the delivery of $18 billion of humanitarian and
<br>
oil-equipment supplies, with another $16 billion in the pipeline. (The rest
<br>
is used to cover administrative costs and reparations to Kuwait.)
<br>
<p>As the U.N. Office for the Iraqi Program stated in a September 28, 2001
<br>
report, &quot;With the improved funding level for the program, the Government of
<br>
Iraq is indeed in a position to address the nutritional and health concerns
<br>
of the Iraqi people, particularly the nutritional status of the children.&quot;
<br>
Even two years earlier, Richard Garfield noted in his survey that &quot;the most
<br>
severe embargo-related damages [have] already ended.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Anyone who tells you more children will perish in Iraq this month than
<br>
Americans died on September 11 is cutting and pasting inflated mid-1990s
<br>
statistics onto a country that has changed significantly since then.
<br>
Knowingly or not, these critics are mangling the facts to prove a debatable
<br>
point and in the process damaging their own cause.
<br>
<p><p>The Truth is Bad Enough
<br>
<p>Two weeks after the hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center and
<br>
the Pentagon, I began looking in earnest for trustworthy sources of
<br>
information about the effects of sanctions on Iraq. I was joined in my
<br>
search by a half-dozen or so e-mail acquaintances who approached the
<br>
question from a broadly similar viewpoint: If sanctions are killing Iraqi
<br>
babies, then Osama Bin Laden has a legitimate propaganda tool, and the U.S.
<br>
has blood on its hands that demands immediate attention. So let's find the
<br>
facts, weigh them against Saddam's weapons capabilities, and proceed from
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>It immediately became obvious that sanctions opponents, especially in the
<br>
U.S., would be a hindrance, not a help. &quot;I'm a little disgusted at the way
<br>
the Naderite left has used the issue, especially when they have no backup
<br>
for the claims they are making,&quot; one of my co-conspirators, Eric Mauro,
<br>
wrote me. &quot;They may be right, but they are so inept at arguing that it's
<br>
dangerous to take their word for it.&quot;
<br>
<p>The man who launched the American anti-sanctions movement as we know it is a
<br>
University of Texas journalism professor named Robert Jensen. His Web site's
<br>
&quot;factsheet&quot; on Iraq contains two lies right off the bat. Citing WHO, he
<br>
claims that &quot;each month 5,000 to 6,000 children die as a result of the
<br>
sanctions.&quot; And citing UNICEF, he asserts that &quot;approximately 250 people die
<br>
every day in Iraq due to the sanctions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jensen, who teaches &quot;critical thinking,&quot; drifted onto the national radar
<br>
screen days after the terrorist attacks, when he wrote a column published in
<br>
ZNet, CommonDreams.org, and The Houston Chronicle titled &quot;U.S. Just As
<br>
Guilty of Committing Own Violent Acts.&quot; He has opposed the war against
<br>
Afghanistan (not to mention Serbia), teaches the journalism of Mumia
<br>
Abu-Jamal, and once wrote a column about how the &quot;U.S. middle class,
<br>
particularly the white middle class, is probably the single biggest
<br>
impediment to justice the world has ever known.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jensen's cohorts in kick-starting the anti-sanctions movement were
<br>
intifada-supporting professor Edward Said, &quot;people's historian&quot; Howard Zinn,
<br>
and Noam Chomsky, a man who has rarely met a foreign policy he couldn't
<br>
describe as &quot;genocide.&quot; The four issued a joint statement in January 1999
<br>
condemning the situation in Iraq as &quot;sanctioned mass-murder that is nearing
<br>
holocaust proportions.&quot;
<br>
<p>These four men have authored reams of hyperbolic nonsense since September
<br>
11. Isn't it reasonable to conclude that anything they and Saddam Hussein
<br>
agree upon must be false?
<br>
<p>No, actually, it's not, and therein lies the problem. Any sustained inquiry
<br>
into the sanctions issue runs up against waves of propaganda and reckless
<br>
disregard for the truth, and it would be all too easy to declare the issue
<br>
settled after a quick dismissal of the most glaring lies. But that would be
<br>
an abdication of responsibility. Many of those who support continued
<br>
pressure on Saddam Hussein tend to focus on a few key counterpoints while
<br>
ignoring piles of haunting in-country surveys and the damning testimony of
<br>
former U.N. officials who have quit to campaign full-time against U.S.
<br>
policy in Iraq. Sanctions proponents, if they are not careful, run the risk
<br>
of aping the foolish debate tactics of the critics they condemn. 
<br>
<p>Take, for example, the lowered mortality rates in the northern provinces of
<br>
Dahuk, Sulaymaniyah, and Erbil -- the smoking gun of the
<br>
sanctions-don't-kill crowd. The New Republic claims the autonomous Kurdish
<br>
area &quot;is subject to exactly the same sanctions as the rest of the country.&quot;
<br>
This is false: Under the oil-for-food regime, the north, which contains 13
<br>
percent of the Iraqi population, receives 13 percent of all oil proceeds, a
<br>
portion of that in cash. Saddam's regions, with 87 percent of the
<br>
population, receive 59 percent of the money (recently increased by the U.N.
<br>
Security Council from 53 percent), none of it in cash. (Of the rest, 25
<br>
percent goes to a Kuwaiti compensation fund, and the rest covers U.N.
<br>
expenses.) 
<br>
<p>It just isn't true that the sanctions are &quot;exactly the same&quot; in both parts
<br>
of Iraq. And there are other factors affecting the north-south disparity:
<br>
International aid agencies have been active in the areas protected by no-fly
<br>
zones since 1991, and the Turkish border is said to be suitably porous for
<br>
smuggling (although Saddam has been caught smuggling several times in the
<br>
past decade).
<br>
<p>The get-Saddam camp also likes to point out that sanctions haven't seemed to
<br>
inflict similar grief in countries such as Libya and Yugoslavia. To which
<br>
Richard Garfield, who compared the various penalized countries, has an
<br>
effective rebuttal: &quot;Embargoes with the greatest impact on the health of the
<br>
general population are usually those which are multilateral and
<br>
comprehensive, occur in countries with heavy import dependence, are
<br>
implemented rapidly, and are accompanied by other economic and social blows
<br>
to a country. Iraq shared each of these characteristics.&quot;
<br>
<p>Those who get past the initial frustrations of researching the topic usually
<br>
end up on Richard Garfield's doorstep. His 1999 report -- which included a
<br>
logistic regression analysis that re-examined four previously published
<br>
child mortality surveys and added bits from 75 or so other relevant studies
<br>
-- picked apart the faulty methodologies of his predecessors, criticized the
<br>
bogus claims of the anti-sanctions left, admitted when the data were shaky,
<br>
and generally used conservative numbers. Among his many interesting findings
<br>
was that every sanctions regime except the one imposed on apartheid South
<br>
Africa led to limitations of food and medicine imports, even though such
<br>
goods were almost always officially exempt from the embargo. &quot;In many
<br>
countries,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the embargo-related lack of capital was more
<br>
important than direct restrictions on importing medicine or food.&quot;
<br>
<p>Garfield concluded that between August 1991 and March 1998 there were at
<br>
least 106,000 excess deaths of children under 5, with a &quot;more likely&quot;
<br>
worst-case sum of 227,000. (He recently updated the latter figure to 350,000
<br>
through this year.) Of those deaths, he estimated one-quarter were &quot;mainly
<br>
associated with the Gulf war.&quot; The chief causes, in his view, were
<br>
&quot;contaminated water, lack of high quality foods, inadequate breast feeding,
<br>
poor weaning practices, and inadequate supplies in the curative health care
<br>
system. This was the product of both a lack of some essential goods, and
<br>
inadequate or inefficient use of existing essential goods.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ultimately, Garfield argued, sanctions played an undeniably important role.
<br>
&quot;Even a small number of documentable excess deaths is an expression of a
<br>
humanitarian disaster, and this number is not small,&quot; he concluded. &quot;[And]
<br>
excess deaths should...be seen as the tip of the iceberg among damages to
<br>
occur among under five-year-olds in Iraq in the 1990s....The humanitarian
<br>
disaster which has occurred in Iraq far exceeds what may be any reasonable
<br>
level of acceptable damages according to the principles of discrimination
<br>
and proportionality used in warfare....To the degree that economic sanctions
<br>
complicate access to and utilization of essential goods, sanctions
<br>
regulations should be modified immediately.&quot;
<br>
<p>Garfield's conclusion echoes that of literally every international agency
<br>
that has performed extensive studies in Iraq. In 1999 a U.N. Humanitarian
<br>
Panel found that &quot;the gravity of the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi
<br>
people is indisputable and cannot be overstated.&quot; UNICEF's Carol Bellamy, at
<br>
the time her landmark report was released, said, &quot;Even if not all suffering
<br>
in Iraq can be imputed to external factors, especially sanctions, the Iraqi
<br>
people would not be undergoing such deprivations in the absence of the
<br>
prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of war.&quot;
<br>
The former U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, Denis Halliday, travels
<br>
around the world calling the policy he once enforced &quot;genocide.&quot; His
<br>
replacement, Hans von Sponeck, also resigned in protest of the U.N.'s
<br>
&quot;criminal policy.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Losing the Loonies
<br>
<p>There have been no weapons inspectors in Iraq since 1998. As a result it is
<br>
exceptionally difficult to know with precision what nuclear and biological
<br>
weapons Saddam actually has on hand or in development. From the beginning,
<br>
economic sanctions have been tied to what foreign policy analyst Mark
<br>
Phythian described in World Affairs as &quot;the first attempt to disarm a
<br>
country against its will.&quot; After September 11, the issue of an
<br>
America-hating tyrant arming himself to the teeth has seemed more pressing
<br>
than easing an embargo that blocks his access to money.
<br>
<p>Yet the basic argument against all economic sanctions remains: namely, that
<br>
they tend to punish civilians more than governments and to provide dictators
<br>
with a gift-wrapped propaganda tool. Any visitor to Cuba can see within 24
<br>
hours the futility of slapping an embargo on a sheltered population that is
<br>
otherwise inclined to detest its government and embrace its yanqui
<br>
neighbors. Sanctions give anti-American enclaves, whether in Cairo or
<br>
Berkeley or Peshawar, one of their few half-convincing arguments about evil
<br>
U.S. policy since the end of the Cold War.
<br>
<p>It seems awfully hard not to conclude that the embargo on Iraq has been
<br>
ineffective (especially since 1998) and that it has, at the least,
<br>
contributed to more than 100,000 deaths since 1990. With Bush set to go to
<br>
war over Saddam's noncompliance with the military goals of the sanctions,
<br>
there has never been a more urgent time to confront the issue with clarity. 
<br>
<p>That means losing the loonies on the left. Already there are signs of
<br>
mounting liberal impatience with the routine smokescreens emanating from the
<br>
usual anti-sanctions rabble. Slate, The Guardian, and even The Nation all
<br>
published sober correctives of dead-Iraqi-baby inflation toward the end of
<br>
2001, decisively backing Richard Garfield over Robert Jensen. And if Noam
<br>
Chomsky no longer leads this particular coalition of critics, maybe they're
<br>
not so wrong after all.
