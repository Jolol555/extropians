<p>
<em>&gt; Two suggestions. First, insisting that freedom and responsability are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something nice to have on an individual basis strikes me as not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right course (it may be the course taken by Ayn Rand's novels, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't read them so I don't know).
</em><br>
<p>I suggest encouraging critical thinking instead of just stuffing memes into these people's heads. From what I had seen in
<br>
educational systems, it seems like they greatly prefer the &quot;meme stuffer&quot; method which they obessively test with endless
<br>
examinations.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It so happens that this only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeals to very few people (the ones with high self-confidence), which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably the reason why libertarian ideas are still so marginally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted. But when people realize that personal freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsability must be protected for the society to flourish and solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its problems, then, if the argument is convincing, it should appeal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.
</em><br>
<p>In Singapore, the people here do not generally believe in Libertarian thinking. Many people do not believe that anacho-capitalist
<br>
societies can work. The assumptions that Libertarians make seems just too fantastic for them.
<br>
<p>The largest barrier to considering such issues seriously seems to lie with the lack of critical thinking skills of many people here.
<br>
We should work on this. However, I suspect that many governments would not like such thinking skills.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The other suggestion is that much of it should be modelable into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer simulation. Doing the modeling, then showing what happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you add a law, etc., should be enlightening. (One obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty is that one of the main virtue of freedom is invention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought by diversity, and invention doesn't seem very easy to model ;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you could use genetical algorithms on a specific solution space for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.)
</em><br>
<p>I suspect that at best, such a model would only give an overly simplified picture of the situation. At worse, it could give a very
<br>
misleading one. Human societies have too much complexity that modelling them accurately would require an insane amount of
<br>
computations that perhaps only transhuman intelligences can undertake for human societies.
