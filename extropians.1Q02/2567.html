<p>
A SENEGALESE CORPORATION ( yeah sorry but my hdd is failing on my vaio
<br>
(development machine) so I'm depressed and just feel like joining that cow
<br>
business =)):
<br>
You have 5 cows, they're healthy and produce x amounts of milk/month. Soon
<br>
there are 10 cows, then 20, then 30. When the number reaches 40, suddenly 38
<br>
cows literally disappear. Some Senegalese breeders accuse Mauritanians. The
<br>
Mauritanians say they're innocent. Some fight starts, and someone dies. The
<br>
story gets told and retold by the press. People's fears and angers are being
<br>
played with. A few hundreds Mauritanians get slaughtered in broad daylight
<br>
(decapitations and emasculations and the whole shabang...), their shops and
<br>
businesses are vandalized, burned. State of emergency is declared in
<br>
Senegal. In the meantime, everybody forgets about the cows....
<br>
<p><p>PS: I was there....it's a true story (in the real story, no cows were
<br>
stolen, I forgot what was the exact issue but it was like 'your cows are
<br>
eating my grass'), , I was a teenager then and it scared the hell outta
<br>
me.... Some perfectly 'normal' people that I knew, turned into shop
<br>
looters... I'm talking about adults, not kids.... Public anger is a
<br>
dangerous thing. Senegal and Mauritania are long term neighbours,
<br>
Mauritanians used to run most street corners shops in Senegal, those events
<br>
ended that state of affairs.
<br>
<p>*bored and angry Arona*
<br>
<p>PS2: Anyone involved in anything PalmOS on the list ? If yes, reply offlist
<br>
please.
