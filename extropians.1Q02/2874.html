</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Which historical texts describe the First World War as a history of
<br>
imperialism vs. human liberty? Fact: The predominant powers involved all
<br>
held territories and colonies that were viewed   by participants at the time
<br>
as imperial structures. The powers that fought each other included the
<br>
British Empire, the German Empire, the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian
<br>
Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Japanese Empire. The First World War was
<br>
not a conflict against imperialism; it was a war between empires and
<br>
nations. If you want to simplify such a complex history, you might view it
<br>
as a battle between empire and nation, within its European context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Countries would not go to war against each other if one side or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other were not lying about their point of view.
</em><br>
<p>If you wish to view a war in terms of the ideologies expressed by the
<br>
participants, how do you distinguish between their ideas and the propaganda
<br>
created in support of their point of view? Propaganda is a natural tool of
<br>
any nation at war and all sides lie about their intentions and their goals.
<br>
At least, any country at war has done this so far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this faith versus reason war, you have various faiths: in god, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power, in a romantic vision of some arcadian or andelusian period, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; golden age in the past. This is true whether you are talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalist muslims, christian fundamentalists, or fanatical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eco-terrorists and anti-tech luddites. All of these seek to impose some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great lie on the world, and to stamp out the voice of reason which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illuminates the emptiness of their lies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you wish to view history through this construct of faith versus reason
<br>
(and it is not an interpretation that appears to have a great deal of
<br>
explanatory force), then surely you should note that one of the greatest
<br>
vehicles of faith since 1789 has been nationalism. Faith in one's nation has
<br>
been the motive for evil atrocities up to and including genocide. Would you
<br>
add the nationalist to your list?
