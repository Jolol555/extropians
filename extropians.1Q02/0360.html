<p><em>&gt; a) Do different countries have the EXACT same bills and coins in every

</em><br>
<p>Yes, they do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As several europeans here have said, there are very slight but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticable differences on the paper bills
</em><br>
<p>It may be possible to discern the origin of a bill without having
<br>
to apply forensics.  I mean, at the very least the serial numbers
<br>
are different, and they are probably allocated in ranges to the
<br>
national printeries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the reverse side of every coin has  graphics particular to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country in which it is stamped.
</em><br>
<p>Where it has originally been issued, to be precise, which doesn't
<br>
necessarily coincide with the place of production.  Luxembourg had
<br>
all their coins minted in neighboring countries for instance.  By
<br>
the way, there are 15 series of national backsides since Monaco,
<br>
San Marino, and Vatican City have also issued euro coins by contract
<br>
with the ECB, although you are unlikely to encounter those in
<br>
circulation as they will probably be picked up right away by
<br>
collectors.
<br>
<p>Anyway, all this gives you are a variety of possible backsides for
<br>
the same coin.  That kind of variation has previously existed in
<br>
the national currencies as well.  At least the German-issued euro
<br>
coins also have a tiny marker that identifies the actual mint (just
<br>
like the mark coins had).  A 1 euro coin is a 1 euro coin, no matter
<br>
whether it has a German F backside, a German D backside, or a French
<br>
backside, just to mention those I have at hand at the moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) Therefore, there are 12 different national mints involved in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production of the new european currency, and the 12 different central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banks who run those mints.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know the exact number of printeries and mints involved.
<br>
The old national central banks have atropied to branches of the
<br>
ECB.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All it takes is for one of those mints to decide to over or under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce their local currency to entirely mess up the money supply for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.
</em><br>
<p>This scenario is about as plausible as Florida going rogue and
<br>
messing up the US money supply by printing lots of dollar bills.
<br>
The ECB decides how much cash is issued.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All that has really occured is that all 12 countries have changed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name of their currency to the 'Euro' and have agreed to tie the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each to that of all other 'Euros',
</em><br>
<p>Get a clue.  When, after a decade of fiscal convergence, the euro
<br>
replaced the national currencies three years ago (!), the participating
<br>
countries gave up their monetary sovereignty to the European Central
<br>
Bank (located in Frankfurt/Main).  Those unwilling to do so, most
<br>
notably the British, didn't join the Eurozone.  The final introduction
<br>
of euro cash this year is a monetary no-op that only amounts to an
<br>
exchange of the bill designs (something European countries customarily
<br>
do once in a while anyway) and coins in circulation.  The monetary
<br>
union is not some knee-jerk project, but the culmination of decades
<br>
of preparatory work.
<br>
<p>By the way, while I'm dropping some facts here, I'd like to mention
<br>
the travel information that apart from twelve EU countries (Portugal,
<br>
Spain, Ireland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands,
<br>
Germany, Austria, Finland, Greece) with various overseas possessions
<br>
(principally the French DOMTOMs), the euro is also the official
<br>
currency in the EU-associated microstates Andorra, Monaco, San
<br>
Marino, and Vatican City, as well as in the Yugoslav republic of
<br>
Montenegro and in the Kosovo, both of the latter having previously
<br>
relied on the German mark.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The heads of each national Central Bank belong to the European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Central Bank, but that doesn't mean that each national bank will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually honestly deal with everyone else.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there's no arguing against paranoid delusions.
