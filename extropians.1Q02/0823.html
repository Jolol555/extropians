</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfair. It showed several violent outbursts and his wife did not abandon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him even if they were divorced, and they remarried.
</em><br>
<p>I stand ready to be corrected, but my understanding was that he had 
<br>
at times quite violent outbursts; much nastier than were shown in the 
<br>
film. Overall I had the impression that they went out their way to 
<br>
make Nash likeable, which is fine if its a fictional story, but 
<br>
irritating if in fact it is a whitewash of someone's life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;And where was the science?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you ask too much. Put it this way, would you invest your own hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;earned money into a mainstream Hollywood movie where a major plot point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved nonlinear parameter estimation
</em><br>
<p>I would also expect a mainstream Hollywood film to sanitize and 
<br>
create a &quot;uplifting&quot; story of someone's life to ensure ticket sales. 
<br>
Never underestimate the intelligence of the viewing public as they 
<br>
say...  I agree that science is hard to present in films, and perhaps 
<br>
this was not the main point of the film, but a little more science 
<br>
would have been nice.
<br>
<p>I was also a little surprised by the depiction of schizophrenia in 
<br>
the film. Does anyone know how accurate the depictions of Nash's 
<br>
delusions were? They seemed very coherent. Its hard to believe he had 
<br>
an imaginary roommate all through college without this ever being 
<br>
picked up.
<br>
<p>best, patrick
