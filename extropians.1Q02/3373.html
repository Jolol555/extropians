<p><em>&gt; Trade can sometimes have paradoxal effects. In Britain they lowered the

<p>Seems like there is a much better way.  Currently there
<br>
is a chronic shortage of blood, particularly O negative.
<br>
Stanford uses two techniques to deal with the problem,
<br>
both of them bad: first, they call all the regular bleeders
<br>
asking for a donation (even if they are not eligible for
<br>
having bled just last month) which is mildly irritating and
<br>
tempts one to just say no, as well as making one less
<br>
likely to donate in an actual emergency.
<br>
<p>Second, they have started taking more blood from each
<br>
donor, jumping directly from 420 to 500 ml.  That is too
<br>
big of a change for starters, but furthermore they do not
<br>
adjust the size of the donation to the size of the donor.
<br>
At 57 kg, I miss that 500 ml more than my 110 kg buddy
<br>
who I have talked into donating.
<br>
<p>What if, instead of offering 20 bucks cash, they would
<br>
spend 20 bucks on a quickly chemical analysis of the
<br>
blood, measuring iron levels, sugar, lipids, etc, to provide
<br>
the donor with a few numbers she could keep in a
<br>
spreadsheet.  This way she could note trends or unusual
<br>
readings, perhaps providing advance warning of medical
<br>
problems, kind of a free and convenient mini-health
<br>
screening with a bonus warm fuzzy.
<br>
<p>Junkies and drunks would not likely care, and so would
<br>
stay away, whereas this system would draw in the
<br>
worried well, the hypochondriac crowd, the well fed
<br>
vitamin-quaffing upwardly mobile, just the kind of
<br>
blood you want filling your bank to overflowing.  Could
<br>
we not make some kind of electronic chip or device that
<br>
measures a dozen different blood chemicals for 20 bucks
<br>
each?  I think we can.  Furthermore the recipients would
<br>
glaaaaadly pay 20 bucks a unit more for the blood
<br>
knowing it came from the health conscious, eh? spike
