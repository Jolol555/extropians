Part 1.  (Off the top -)
<br>
<p>As people learn about and understand more the injustices of current political systems, the better opportunity for “transhumanist” ideals to appear in political dialogue and become a landmark in the restructuring of what is known as democracy.  In transhumanism we need to experience our investment in the interests of transhumanism and to exercise such investments.  If we are stifled by the governing factors, then there is indeed a problem unless we develop a transhumanist system of representation. 
<br>
<p>To forge a new political agenda informing and guiding modern transhumanism would be one that would enable us to move beyond the traditional struggle for a balance or compromise between irreconcilable ideologies and develop an approach to politics that is more compatible with the premises of transhumanism.  (Adaptation P.D. Hutcheon.) 
<br>
<p>Rather than rampage over and toss out the scraps of what doesn’t work, it would be better to make a list of each political format and write a list of pros and cons in regards to transhumanist goals.  Not all of democratic liberal agenda works; there are shortcomings.  What are they?  Same with democracy, socialist and libertarian agendas. 
<br>
<p>References have been made to humanists and democracy:
<br>
<p>The Humanist Political party suggests: “Humanists struggle to transform the practice of representative government, giving the highest priority to consulting the people directly through referenda, plebiscites, and direct election of candidates. However, in many countries there are still laws that subordinate independent candidates to political parties, or rather to political maneuvering and financial restrictions that prevent them from even reaching the ballot and the free expression of the will of the people.” (end)
<br>
<p>In real democracy, all minorities must be provided with the protections that correspond to their right to representation, as well as all measures needed to advance in practice their full inclusion, participation, and development.  
<br>
<p>Further: “Today, minorities the world over who are the targets of xenophobia and discrimination make anguished pleas for recognition. It is the responsibility of humanists everywhere to bring this issue to the fore, leading the struggle to overcome such neo-fascism, whether overt or covert. In short, to struggle for the rights of minorities is to struggle for the rights of all human beings.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Under the coercion of centralized states ; today no more than the unfeeling instruments of big capital; many countries with diverse populations subject entire provinces, regions, or autonomous groups to this same kind of discrimination. This must end through the adoption of federal forms of organization, through which real political power will return to the hands of these historical and cultural entities.  
<br>
<p>“In sum, to give highest priority to the issues of capital and labor, real democracy, and decentralization of the apparatus of the State, is to set the political struggle on the path toward creating a new kind of society; a flexible society constantly changing in harmony with the changing needs of the people, who are now suffocated more each day by their dependence on an inhuman system.” (end)
<br>
<p>In order to understand what the political agenda will best represent transhumanism let’s consider the values of transhumanists. We know what our values.  I’m not sure I understand why Anders thinks transhumanism is lacking a value system.  Maybe I’m misunderstanding what he means by values.  However, there are numerous papers written about transhumanist values.  Inasmuch, these values may have changed over the years based on our needs which also change, just as our goals have changed due to current economic climates.  Nonetheless, these core values become the basis for the best political agenda. 
<br>
<p>Consider the pit-falls of thinking:  “What problem areas of thinking am I likely to fall into?”  Consider the ethics of our needs or desires:  “What are my choices for freedom and individual choice?” How do we deal with restrictions placed on our goals in both the medical profession and technology.  Do we need to compromise some aspects of our values to obtain important goals?  Is there a political agenda today within the currents of international politics that fit transhumanist values and goals?
<br>
<p>Putting aside the labels of political agendas, which are the most appropriate policies of each one that could fit into a political schema for transhumanists?
