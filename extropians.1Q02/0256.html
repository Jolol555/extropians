<p>
I get to deal with VCs far too much. That said, on with the rambling
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>There was a little discussion on the list recently on AI and business, and I
<br>
was meaning to jump in an ask a question back then. Got distracted by cats
<br>
or something similar. My question essentially revolves around monetization
<br>
of intermediary steps in AI development. From my readings online, there's
<br>
very little that discusses what happens in between
<br>
<p>a) useful primer steps like Cyg, Flarelang, etc
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>b) boom! functioning, if very crude general intelligence or seed AI
<br>
<p>Which I would assume is because no-one really knows for sure (or else we'd
<br>
be hip deep in AIs by now).
<br>
<p>Now if you're walking into a VC's office to pitch an AI company -- one of
<br>
the few places you're guaranteed not to be the strangest project they've
<br>
seen -- they're going to want to hear how you're going to be generating
<br>
revenue within six months from an initial investment. [Since you're a
<br>
software company, that is, and producing those easy-to-make software things,
<br>
as opposed to an infrastructure company making those hard-to-make lumps of
<br>
iron, but I digress -- lambasting VCs is far too easy].
<br>
<p>So you're starting out with something along the lines of a concept, perhaps
<br>
some useful protocode for classifying information and information
<br>
processing, possibly even a grasp of the One True Path To AI. What can you
<br>
produce in six months that you can sell? What is the improvement on that
<br>
that would be coming out in a year?
<br>
<p>Given the demographics of this list, I'm sure that at least a couple of you
<br>
have put some thought into this. Anyone care to share?
