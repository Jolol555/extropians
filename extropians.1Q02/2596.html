<em>&gt; Just a thought (to get back to extropian matters): suppose drivers could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affect lights through some technological means. Would there be any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that would make the traffic throughput more efficient than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current timer-based lights?
</em><br>
<p>A market-based system would be interesting to try.  Give each intersection
<br>
an owner (could be just a software agent) which tries to maximize profits.
<br>
Then sell green-light futures seconds or minutes in advance.  This would
<br>
allow someone to purchase green lights for their entire cross-town trip.
<br>
<p>At uncongested times, there wouldn't be many people bidding the other
<br>
way and you could get your green lights for cheap.  But when there is
<br>
congestion, more elaborate mechanisms would be required.  You would
<br>
want to be able to see who else is setting up green light paths which
<br>
are going your way, so you can add your clout to their path and outbid
<br>
rivals who are setting up conflicting (crossing) paths.  You would also
<br>
want to be able to easily slip your schedule forward and backward a few
<br>
seconds so as to avoid crossing conflicts as much as possible.
<br>
<p>It's easy to say that the market will screw in the lightbulb, but actually
<br>
setting up the institutions to let a market work is another matter.
<br>
Optimizing traffic flow is a complex, nonlocal problem which may not be
<br>
ideally suited to market mechanisms.  But in principle the market takes
<br>
into consideration the wishes of all participants and prioritizes them.
<br>
If mechanisms can be arranged to let the market work, this could be an
<br>
optimal solution.
<br>
<p>I've been thinking about similar ideas for traffic flow in general, not
<br>
only at intersections but on highways as well.  Wouldn't it be great if
<br>
there were some mechanism to pay the slowpoke in front of you to pull
<br>
over, or to get the tailgater behind you to move back?  The signals which
<br>
exist now from driver to driver are limited and clumsy.  Surely it should
<br>
be possible to improve on what exists today.
<br>
