<p><p>By Merritt McKinney
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Stem cells, the immature cells that can give
<br>
rise to a variety of specialized cells, are essential in early
<br>
development, but new research suggests that, in worms at least, one type
<br>
of stem cell may play a role later in life as well.
<br>
<p>Germ-line stem cells, which differentiate to form cells of the
<br>
reproductive system, seem to be involved in regulating life span in
<br>
nematode worms, according to a team led by Dr. Cynthia Kenyon at the
<br>
University of California, San Francisco.
<br>
<p>``We knew already that the germ line of these animals had an impact on
<br>
life span,'' Dr. Nuno Arantes-Oliveira, the study's first author, told
<br>
Reuters Health in an interview.
<br>
<p>``We've defined which cells produce that effect and when they act,'' he
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>The stem cells kick off the development of the reproductive system, but
<br>
they also seem to regulate the system that speeds aging, the researchers
<br>
report in the January 18th issue of the journal Science.
<br>
<p>``We found that the effect is still present in the adult animal,''
<br>
Arantes-Oliveira said.
<br>
<p>The investigators previously found that killing certain germ-line
<br>
precursor cells that form from stem cells extends the life span of
<br>
nematode worms.
<br>
<p>Although earlier research has shown that reproduction can reduce life
<br>
span, this did not seem to explain the life-extending effects of killing
<br>
germ-line precursor cells. The researchers found that removing the
<br>
entire reproductive system from the worms did not have any effect on how
<br>
long they lived.
<br>
<p>In a series of experiments, the researchers tried to find out which
<br>
parts of the reproductive system were involved in regulating life span.
<br>
They were able to rule out several types of cells, including sperm and
<br>
eggs, since removing them did not make worms live longer.
<br>
<p>But killing germ-line stem cells did extend the worms' lives.
<br>
<p>The next step, according to Arantes-Oliveira, will be to learn how these
<br>
stem cells influence longevity.
<br>
<p>``The big thing will be to find out what signals these tissues are
<br>
producing,'' he said. One possibility, according to the California
<br>
researcher, is that some kind of hormone is producing the effect. Once
<br>
the mechanism is revealed, it may be possible to see whether it is
<br>
present in other species, such as humans, he said.
<br>
<p>The researchers point out in the report that fruit flies live longer
<br>
when their precursor germ-line cells are killed, suggesting that the
<br>
role of early germ-line cells in aging may be conserved in several
<br>
species.
<br>
<p>In the interview, Arantes-Oliveira said that the evidence that a similar
<br>
process occurs in fruit flies is ``very suggestive.'' But, he cautioned,
<br>
``We don't know whether the effect is the same or not.''
