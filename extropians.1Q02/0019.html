From: &quot;Forrest Bishop&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:forrestb@ix.netcom.com?Subject=Re:%20my%20invisible%20friend%20is%20better%20than%20yours">forrestb@ix.netcom.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; A series of imagined contracts and exchanges of material ensues that need
</em><br>
not be the result of
<br>
<em>&gt; self-aware cognition.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that works... but only in imagination.
<br>
In reality, Mises is closer to the truth, because his position addresses the
<br>
real world, and from that, he theorizes. He doesn't begin with a theory and
<br>
then try to make it conform to reality. People live in community, in society
<br>
with other people. We are a social species.
<br>
The superorganism is not at all &quot;invisible&quot; if you look at the networks that
<br>
connect people... Have you seen photos of the Earth at night, from a few miles
<br>
up? Electricity seems to be the life blood of the superorganism.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
