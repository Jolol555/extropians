I have never been sure what such claims really mean, however...

<p>Electrical pulses break light speed record
<br>
22 January 2002 Pulses that travel faster than light have been sent over a 
<br>
significant distance for the first time. Alain Haché and Louis Poirier of the 
<br>
University of Moncton in Canada transmitted the pulses through a 120-metre 
<br>
cable made from a coaxial 'photonic crystal'. The achievement raises hopes 
<br>
that data could travel through electronic communications systems at almost 
<br>
the speed of light (A Haché and L Poirier 2002 Appl. Phys. Lett. 80 518). 
<br>
<p>When a pulse of radiation travels through a 'dispersive' medium, different 
<br>
wavelengths in the pulse move at different speeds and the pulse becomes 
<br>
distorted. Ordinary dispersion arises when the refractive index of a material 
<br>
changes with increasing wavelength. This stretches out the pulse and reduces 
<br>
the group velocity - the speed at which the peak of the pulse travels. But 
<br>
'anomalous dispersion' can occur in materials that absorb radiation in a 
<br>
certain range of wavelengths. The refractive index on either side of this 
<br>
absorption band changes sharply with wavelength. In these regions, the 
<br>
components of radiation at the tail of the pulse interfere destructively, and 
<br>
the peak of the wave is effectively pushed forward. To create their cable, 
<br>
the Canadian researchers joined together five-metre sections of coaxial cable 
<br>
with alternating electrical impedences. Radiation in the frequency range 9 - 
<br>
11 MHz is partially reflected at the boundaries of these segments, which 
<br>
gives the cable its absorption band. Haché and Poirier sent electromagnetic 
<br>
pulses with frequencies between 5 and 15 MHz through the cable, and found 
<br>
that the group velocity reached three times the speed of light for 
<br>
frequencies in the absorption band. Haché and Poirier emphasize that their 
<br>
experiment does not break any laws of physics. Although the group velocity 
<br>
exceeds the speed of light - an effect permitted by relativity - each 
<br>
component of the pulse travels slower than light. It would be impossible to 
<br>
transmit information faster than light because it would be encoded onto a 
<br>
single frequency component. But as Haché explains, many existing information 
<br>
systems are based on coaxial cables, and the current top speed for data is 
<br>
just two-thirds the speed of light. If the impedance of such cables were 
<br>
adapted, pulses sent at frequencies close to the absorption band could 
<br>
transmit information at speeds approaching that of light. 'Oddly, the reason 
<br>
no one has done this before is that we are using what most people are trying 
<br>
to avoid - the back-reflection caused by impedance mismatch', Haché told 
<br>
PhysicsWeb. 'But as far as superluminal propagation goes, this is the key'.
