Just to help clear up some of the confusion there seems to be here.
<br>
<p>As of midnight, Jan 1st, all currency supply is in euro (in theory at least 
<br>
, in practice it was pretty much the case here).  All currencies are still 
<br>
valid, but with one extra, the euro.  This is the transition 
<br>
period.  Payment can be in either Euro or the old currency, but all change 
<br>
is given in Euro only.
<br>
<p>&quot;Legacy&quot; currencies will no longer be legal tender at the end of the 
<br>
transition period, Feb 28th.  Our final transition date here will be Feb 9th.
<br>
<p>As for euro-variants, there are none.  Each countrys coinage has a matching 
<br>
top side, with a national emblem/symbol on the other.  All euro notes I've 
<br>
seen are almost identical across all countries.   A Greek Euro note will be 
<br>
the same when spent here as any other euro note.  It's not even likely to 
<br>
be noticed as a Greek minted note.  All are legal tender anywhere in the 
<br>
Eurozone, and are required to be accepted.  All notes will pass 
<br>
authentication in all validation machines (assuming it's genuine to begin 
<br>
with).  I've not seen any business using these machines so 
<br>
far.  Personally, I think the new notes are quite pretty, even if the 
<br>
images are a little dull.  Then again, we've always had fairly colourful 
<br>
notes here.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, Britain has had differing versions of its notes for NI, 
<br>
Scotland, England...  Never been an issue, with the exception of a handful 
<br>
of Scottish cabbies.  I hear they don't like the NI money :-)
<br>
<p>As a matter of interest, we will be 90% converted here in Ireland by the 
<br>
weekend, a full week ahead of expectations.  We carry little cash here, 
<br>
preferring credit cards or a trip to an ATM, so the old currency has 
<br>
disappeared quickly.
<br>
<p>I am now Euro converted, having spent my last 53 Irish pence today.  Most 
<br>
of my work companions were euro only by the first day.  For us, the 
<br>
transition has been quick and painless.
<br>
<p>As for the currency leading to a war as someone stated here, I'm not sure 
<br>
how they arrived at that conclusion, given Europe as it is 
<br>
today.  Countries that felt that strongly about retaining fiscal &quot;autonomy&quot; 
<br>
remained outside the Eurozone.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p><p><p>James...

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and

crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures

to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
