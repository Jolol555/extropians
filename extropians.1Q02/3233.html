</em><br>
<p>Self ownership is a central concept for extropian thought: our bodies
<br>
are our own to dispose of. And it seems reasonable to accept the right
<br>
to testament one's possessions - including the body.
<br>
<p>Does organ transplants promote extropy? I would say so - they help other
<br>
beings live full lives. But there is no necessary ethical obligation to
<br>
do it, it is just a good act and may become subordinate to other
<br>
concerns.
<br>
<p>One such concern is that currently cryonics is incompatible with organ
<br>
donation: cryopreserved organs are not suitable, and the interval
<br>
between diagnosed brain death and finishing the transplantation
<br>
operation is likely so long that significant deterioration will have
<br>
occured. So if you bet your personal survival on cryonics, you can't at
<br>
the same time become an organ donor according to current rules. 
<br>
<p>It is of course possible that rules will change in the future and it
<br>
will be OK to transplant organs from cryonics patients stipulating this
<br>
in their wills. But I think this is rather unlikely - the number of
<br>
cryonics patients is so low and non destructive organ retrival from
<br>
frozen bodies so hard that it is unlikely to be relevant for the organ
<br>
shortage issue. Instead technological aspects such as tissue engineering
<br>
are very likely to become central (and provide one of the inroads
<br>
towards cell repair). Scenarios about geting revived and having to go on
<br>
external dialysis appears self contradictory: if the government limits
<br>
research into replacement organs, then you can bet it will limit
<br>
research into replacement bodies and cell repair!
<br>
<p>If you are not cryonically suspended and die, then at least donating
<br>
organs can provide some extra help to other aspiring beings. You have
<br>
not lost more from doing this (having already lost everything,
<br>
unfortunately). But this altruism is in the end up to you.
