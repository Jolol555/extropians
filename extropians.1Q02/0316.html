<em>&gt; Why? It takes four months, five developers and a quarter of a million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars to produce software that retails for half a million, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support. In most cases, this is the compromise version -- the full (and much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complex) vision isn't realized until a few years of new versions down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the line. So the argument would be, if someone can dedicate resources to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that for another field, what is it about AI development that means you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce something that can be sold in the same timeframe?
</em><br>
<p>If AI development were not qualitatively more difficult than a
<br>
*programming* task, the Singularity would have occurred long since (the
<br>
early nineties would be my guess).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With a broader view of the term &quot;product,&quot; alternatively, you could produce,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) knowledgable consultants to farm out to other AI ventures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) a single useful component that can be licensed to other AI ventures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) a book on AI development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; d) the material and contacts for a subscription-based newsletter for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And so forth. Not that I'm convince there's a vast market of AI ventures out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, but I don't think that there's anything wrong with taking those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directions.
</em><br>
<p>If we'd wanted to go that route, we could have done Flare as a for-profit
<br>
venture.  And if we'd wanted to go *that* route, I have a half-dozen good
<br>
ideas for starting a for-profit corporation; they just happen to be
<br>
totally unrelated to AI.
<br>
<p>But there is a saying:  &quot;Life is what happens while you are making other
<br>
plans.&quot;  And life has taught me that if you want to avoid this curse
<br>
coming true of you, you had better avoid doing ANYTHING that does not
<br>
DIRECTLY advance your long-term goal (in my case, the Singularity).  If
<br>
I'd known this when I was sixteen, I would have been able to put in an
<br>
additional two years or so of Singularity work by now.
<br>
<p>And furthermore, we don't dare run the risk of building a *good*,
<br>
*profitable* product in a for-profit company.  This could easily be worse
<br>
than building a bad product; &quot;life is what happens while you are making
<br>
other plans&quot; would very quickly happen to us, and the &quot;interim product&quot;
<br>
would become the company.  A spinoff of a real, direct-to-Singularity
<br>
development effort is one matter; a genuine spinoff can be handed over to
<br>
new programmers while the core development continues.  Building something
<br>
easy and safe that isn't what you actually want to build, as your core
<br>
development effort, is much more dangerous a distraction.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, no matter how good an idea I have for a for-profit
<br>
corporation, it still isn't going to have better than a fifty percent
<br>
chance of success, because the ordinary failure rate for startups is
<br>
ninety-five percent.  If I still thought that the Singularity was located
<br>
in 2030, the way I did when I first got into all this, then I might be
<br>
more inclined to try and start a for-profit corporation to get the funding
<br>
et cetera, because there would actually be the time to take the company
<br>
public and sell the stock and turn it into a private operating foundation,
<br>
or to try again with a nonprofit if the for-profit route failed.  As it
<br>
is, the possible horrendous time crunch only confirms the recommendation
<br>
of my experience so far, and that experience is this: working directly on
<br>
the Singularity is the only thing that got me anywhere in life, while
<br>
working on other things in the name of &quot;practicality&quot; and &quot;doing something
<br>
for the short term&quot; just wasted my time.
