<em>&gt; I have a question about Penrose's Arguments regarding the Turing Halting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theorem.  I see that the program T sub n of n can never successfully prove 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it will never halt, when, in fact, a human can see and prove that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never halt.  However, I fail to see how the humans task is the same as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computer's task.  If the analogous task, a human asked to create a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof(n) that they could not create the proof(n), were attempted, the human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would fail just as completely as the program.  Of course, a human would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give up after a while, as I'd expect an AI to terminate that subroutine.
</em><br>
<p>This is similar to the notion captured in the claim: &quot;Penrose cannot
<br>
consistently believe in the truth of this sentence.&quot;  Anyone of us can
<br>
see it's true, but not poor Penrose!
<br>
<p>But actually Penrose's claim is not that people can prove contradictions,
<br>
but rather that they can prove all true theorems.  Computers which operate
<br>
via strict logic cannot, because they get stuck on their Godel sentence,
<br>
T_n(n) in Penrose's notation.  Humans never get stuck, according to
<br>
Penrose, therefore they don't have Godel sentences, therefore they do
<br>
not operate via logic as computers do.  Hence computers based on logic
<br>
can never reproduce human thought.
<br>
<p>IMO the flaw is in the first step, the claim that humans can prove all
<br>
mathematical truths.  This is self-evidently absurd since most truths
<br>
are far too complex for the entire human race ever to understand (just
<br>
as most numbers are far too big for any human to comprehend).
