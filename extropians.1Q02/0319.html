</em><br>
<p>I do not believe that this is really the case regardless of bin
<br>
Laden's propaganda broadcasts that he is bent on either
<br>
destroying or converting all of &quot;the Great Satan&quot;.  But I could
<br>
be mistaken.  It is quite sufficient for now imho if we
<br>
concentrate on what we know, which is that a group of
<br>
international terrorists attacked us on our home turf.  I still
<br>
fear that if we believe it is a concentrated plot to destroy our
<br>
entire civilization that then the response levels will grow very
<br>
dangerously to a level that is potentially quite harmful to
<br>
reaching Singularity.   If it ever comes down to a choice
<br>
between a major war that delays Singularity by at least a
<br>
genration if not more and perhaps suffering some terrorist
<br>
attacks  (but going after the perps quite hard and bringing them
<br>
to justice without inflaming the whole world) while we continue
<br>
to move forward on a more aggressive schedule to Singularity I
<br>
would opt for the latter any time.
