<p>
Good things are happening at Alcor.  They have decided when and where the next big conference will be, and a cryonics &quot;peace and cooperation conference among organizations&quot; is in the offing.
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>Dr. Jerry Lemler, President, CEO wrote in the latest Alcor update:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning and preparation for major conferences dominated the landscape
<br>
at Alcor this past week.  As many of you know, Alcor benefactor and member,
<br>
Bill Faloon is forming a new cryotransport company in South Florida, and
<br>
has invited cryonicists of all stripes to an introductory meeting on
<br>
Saturday, February 16.  Bill has also extended me an invitation to spend
<br>
the week leading up the the kickoff meeting with him and the principals of
<br>
this nascent operation, to provide logistical and tactical support on
<br>
matters of site and staff selection.  So, I'll be in the sunshine state (a
<br>
great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to vote there) for the Cryofeast
<br>
sponsored by Rudi Hoffman on Sunday, February 10, and then drive down to
<br>
Ft. Lauderdale the following day.  I'll be joined mid-week by Alcor
<br>
Treasurer and Board Member, Michael Riskin.  I surely do appreciate
<br>
Michael's solid number crunching abilities, and his conviviality is a real
<br>
bonus!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcor's next major conference is taking shape.  We'll be convening in
<br>
Newport Beach, California, on November 15-18, at the Newport Beach Marriott
<br>
Hotel and Tennis Club.  Thanks go to Conference Committee Chairman Dr.
<br>
Ralph Merkle for landing such an outstanding venue.  We're now in the
<br>
process of lining up presenters for this affair, and appropriate
<br>
announcements will be forthcoming shortly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, following mutual complimentary Cryonet postings, Bob Ettinger
<br>
and I have opened a personal communications dialogue.  We have been joined
<br>
by ACS President Edgar Swank, the end result of which has been an
<br>
acceptance of my call for a CryoSummit this summer in Michigan involving
<br>
all three (and possibly a fourth) of our organizations sending delegations
<br>
to convene in discussing a mutually prepared agenda, hopefully resulting in
<br>
the formation of alliances to strengthen our individual organizations as
<br>
well as the cryonics movement as a whole.
