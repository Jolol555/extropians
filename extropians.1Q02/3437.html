</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Lately I am down enough on the way things are going to  doubt if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;anything but some variant of (c) is currently viable.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with your c) option.  A virtual nation (VN) or virtual community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (VC) *might* be one way to do that on a larger than personal scale.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not fully convinced of this yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One problem I see is that a game universe is populated by those *with* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;like mind&quot;, i.e. they want to play the game.  A virtual nation wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have that any more than a real nation does.  You'd have conflicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desires, attitudes and varying capabilities and resources and the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result would a duplicate of the real world - a Darwinian competition with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losers and winners.  One interesting question would be:  would the nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the VN change the nature of the winners - i.e., would Transhumanists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to be the winners if they built the VN?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason's basic problem is he assumes you need a &quot;fairly large number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially right-minded people&quot;.  I'm not convinced there is such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number.  I suspect &quot;true&quot; Transhumanists (or even sympathizers) are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than one percent of the population.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. I wasn't thinking transhumanists when I wrote that. More libertarians,
<br>
or at least those who don't like stupidity and government in every bowl of
<br>
cereal each morning.
<br>
<p>By &quot;those with a like mind&quot; I mean people who want to spend a significant
<br>
fraction of their time socializing/living/working in the virtual nation.
<br>
This doesn't have to overlap with a particular political or socioeconomic
<br>
view if they're just doing it because it's fun or economically beneficial
<br>
(see the taxes thing again).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would like Reason to detail how the Everquest people are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black-market economics in the real world.
</em><br>
<p>The EQ dictatorship (Verant), with the cooperation of the US and EU legal
<br>
systems, forbids the trading of EQ intangibles for real world money. With
<br>
some cooperation in suppression from real world marketplaces (such as eBay).
<br>
Therefore all such markets are black markets; you are breaking real world
<br>
contracts (and possibly laws) and EQ laws if you do this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; See my reply to Reason on Hakim Bey's (Peter Lamborn Wilson) &quot;T.A.Z.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Temporary Autonomous Zones) - a similar concept.  I wonder if Wilson has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered MMORPGs.
</em><br>
<p>URLs? Google uncharacteristically gives me a bunch of junk commentaries
<br>
rather than original sources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problems with Reason's notion that the game could be designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support a lib development is simply that the game rules can be subverted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hacked, or - if irritating enough to enough people - simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abandoned.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more the game must approximate the real world, the less likely the game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world can control real-world behavior *in* in the game.
</em><br>
<p>True, and that's the goal to be aiming for. There's nothing wrong with
<br>
subverting or abandoning rules if the populance of the virtual nation want
<br>
to do it. Goes on all the time in existing games, and it's just another part
<br>
of the cultural complexity.
<br>
<p>My original point was not to control people's behavior; I'm very much
<br>
against that. It's to provide a place to start over with a new nation (a
<br>
slew of new nations), which can prehaps prompt people into seeing that there
<br>
are other, better ways to run a society beyond the one that has been settled
<br>
on in the meat world today. If they then want to abandon that and recreate
<br>
big, invasive governements as virtual nations then so be it. But in theory,
<br>
there are enough libertarians in the world to populate a libertarian virtual
<br>
nation; such would arise in the natural give and take of virtual nation
<br>
ecology once the concept goes mainstream. And if the claims about
<br>
laissez-faire capitalism are right, said nation should wind up very
<br>
influential.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with you that it need to be more than just &quot;fun&quot;.  But &quot;fun&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't be ignored.  How about a game where sex and its pursuit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfaction was a factor.  THAT might bring in a LOT of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and be VERY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profitable - and influential as well in altering attitudes.  That would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attract state oppression, of course, but the state's inability to control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 15 million or so porn sites bodes ill for their suppressing a virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Sex World&quot; - especially if the system were as distributed as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is and more so using encryption, peer-to-peer technology, etc.
</em><br>
<p>This game is being played right now on dating sites the world over. You
<br>
don't need to put this into a game; it just happens. The same goes for
<br>
everything else; economics, social hierarchies, politics, sex -- it will all
<br>
fit itself into any space in which more than three people are talking on a
<br>
regular basis. All the designers of the gamespace have to do is not get in
<br>
the way.
