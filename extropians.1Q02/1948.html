Chen,
<br>
<p>I think I (and many) understand your question.  I am not sure 
<br>
that you understood some of the answers that might look flippant 
<br>
but really aren't (although some were flippant imho).

<p><em>&gt;&gt;Obviously the intent of you asking these questions is very serious, which is

<em>&gt;&gt;serious answers, then ask the question(s) seriously, being specific, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;preferably one question per conversation thread to start with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I am not sure some of the most important questions *can* 
<br>
actually be broken down meaningfully into specific, single 
<br>
questions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we do not have meta-goal type thinking to guide us, then how do we do things like formulating ethics and devising philosophy? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to know this very much. Why do we do what we do, and what guides us to do so? What makes of think of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; and many other things?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p><p>This is a very good question.  What is our ethical basis that is 
<br>
tied up in and validates (perhaps is partially validated by) our 
<br>
vision/notion of the good, of what we would acheive and the 
<br>
means by which it can be acheived?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If we consider everything relative, then we can never condemn Hitler for gassing Jews nor praise Mother Theresa for helping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunate. So, why do we believe in progress, in freedom and in perusing the unknown? How can two nulls make a one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>They can't.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder that perhaps here, we would encounter Gödel's Theorem again. How do we know that &quot;something is preferable over nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including even the experience of nothing&quot;? I don't want to know that we wish to survive, but for what reason do we even bother to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive? I don't want to know about freedom, but why do we even survive and how do we know we should desire freedom. It seems like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we have ignorance we have confusion, but when we have knowledge we have delusions. How do we transcend this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taking the cue from <a href="http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/tmol-faq.html">http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/tmol-faq.html</a>, why do we get up in the morning? If we do so to experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness, to increase knowledge and to contribute to altruism, which will lead to a better universe, then how do we know we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better universe. How would such a universe differ from our own? Why would we decide that we should target this &quot;better&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>If we can have a universe where everyone that wants it has the 
<br>
ability to grow in knowledge, intelligence, creativity, and in 
<br>
any and all things that they find desirable almost without limit 
<br>
relative to where we are today, I cannot help but see that as a 
<br>
huge improvement.  If the 70% illiterates and the 99% without 
<br>
college level education and any computational resources at all 
<br>
could have access to staggering amounts of computing power and 
<br>
all the knowledge of humankind (and more) then I consider that a 
<br>
very happy and desirable goal to work toward.  If every single 
<br>
human being could never ever again have to go without adequate 
<br>
(and even palatial by today's standsrds) shelter and full 
<br>
nutrition and could live all their indefintely long years in 
<br>
perfect health, I consider that very, very good.  Being able to 
<br>
expand our minds individually and collectively far, far beyond 
<br>
what we can imagine I consider very good and utterly enticing. 
<br>
Altruism is just a word.  Creating a world where every single 
<br>
one of us can be enriched beyond our dreams is much, much more 
<br>
than just a word.
<br>
<p>We stand on the threshold of being able to do all of these 
<br>
things.  To do them takes both technical breakthroughs and 
<br>
breakthroughs in ourselves.  The above is not how we habitually 
<br>
see ourselves, the world, and &quot;just the way things are&quot;.  A lot 
<br>
of our programming is in the way of our consistently seeing and 
<br>
working toward such a state and arriving in it.
<br>
<p>We are in a bootstrapping mode in some ways.  We can see a lot 
<br>
that is possible.  Out of the possibilities we need to weave 
<br>
visions of futures that draw us deeply, that we desire deeply 
<br>
enough to be utterly motivated to create if at all possible.  It 
<br>
is not a matter, to me, of sitting around trying to define 
<br>
&quot;good&quot; first and rigorously prove it is &quot;good&quot; up front.  It is 
<br>
a matter of &quot;where do we want to go an how can we get there and 
<br>
what can I do to help&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would a sentient intelligence do better than us even if it converted the entire universe into computing substrate? One day it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to stop existing, even if we put the day of reckoning away by migrating to other universes accidents can still happen, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given eternity, the probability of any improbable event happening will eventually go to one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Define &quot;do better&quot;?  This is the rub.  Would you rather have 
<br>
huge possibilities for growth and happiness for yourself and 
<br>
everyone else or be where you are now for the rest of your 
<br>
(probably short) existence?  Choose and live your choice.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Knowing our long-term mortality, what do that do then? If we will have to die some day, then why do we live? [Please avoid viewing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this from a &quot;pessimistic&quot; point but maintain a neutral one.] Does our happiness, knowledge and other things really matter? Do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really have freedom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>That I may die someday doesn't really bother me.  What really 
<br>
bothers me is that given so much possibility to really remake 
<br>
the circumstances of all of humankind we might be too screwed 
<br>
up, too stupid, lazy and so on to actually do much of anything 
<br>
with it other than figure out fancier ways to enslave, exploit 
<br>
and kill one another and justify our individual and collective 
<br>
meanness.  That bothers me a lot.
