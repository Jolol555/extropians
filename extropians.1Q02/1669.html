</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We need cybercampfire and starry night for this. &quot;42&quot; is the answer (from
<br>
the late lamented Douglas Adams) and seems as good as any meaning. For a
<br>
group philosophically and practically bent on making death optional, the
<br>
answer had better be a good one because we're going to have an awful long
<br>
time to think about it. What's the half-life of a proton.....? whatever.
<br>
<p>The difference between us humans and a rock is that we think we know we're
<br>
not a rock and we can make more humans. This ability confers no 'meaning' or
<br>
'purpose', try as I might to find it.
<br>
<p>So
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Null: The question has no validity. Life has no meaning. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just exist.
</em><br>
<p>does it for me. A tad dry, but I keep ending up here and I'm OK with it.
<br>
<p>I don't know what philosphical label it might have, but what I can say is
<br>
that when I was younger I had a set of absolutes (My son has them now - he
<br>
knows everything - just ask him!). Gradually as I realised that I didn't
<br>
know things and looked further I have become reasonably confident that
<br>
everything, including every last bit of physics in the universe, is
<br>
relative. The philosophical absolutes melt away every time you scrutinise
<br>
them in detail. Maybe some other list member can find one. I can't. Well
<br>
actually there is one absolute - the fact that everything is relative!
<br>
Warning! recursive semantic roadkill ahead!
<br>
<p>Your question demands an absolute. If the above is right I don't think there
<br>
is one. That makes any meaning of anything relative. Choose one and enjoy
<br>
the journey! We're all in it together and I personally think, on the whole,
<br>
it's a hoot.
<br>
<p>As far as a 'role' for humanity is concerned the only one I can think of is
<br>
that we embody part of the universe's self awareness. Indeed, at the moment,
<br>
as far as we know, the _only_ self awareness it has.
<br>
<p>That's a fairly responsible position, don't you think? If there is to be any
<br>
chance of finding said 'meaning of life', we'd better look after each other.
<br>
<p>cheers
