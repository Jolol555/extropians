<p>Yes, this consideration certainly needs to be discussed. I think that making money and building wealth for the future is an important part of exercising the extropian principle of Self-Direction.

<p>Louis, I think you are making an assumption here that is implausible. You equate uploading with no longer having &quot;touch&quot; with the physical (&quot;real&quot;) world. Why should this be? I would find it highly undesirable to lose my ability to affect the physical world and to have a presence in it. Why would uploads not want to have a variety of physical vehicles (owned or rented) through which they could perceive, act, and interact?
<br>
<p>Onward!
