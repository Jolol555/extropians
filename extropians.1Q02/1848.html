If this is written accurately, then it means that human-mouse
<br>
chimeras have been produced.  Now *that* I find interesting
<br>
because I was unaware of it.  But thinking about it, it would
<br>
seem to me that someone must have done this before.  Does anyone
<br>
know how far you can push it (10:1, 5:1, 1:1 Mouse:Human ratio)
<br>
and what happens when you do?
