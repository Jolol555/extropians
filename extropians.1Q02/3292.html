<em>&gt; &gt; The principles do not seem to be enough to constrain an ethical system;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they do not form a set of ethical axioms or constrain the basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropian ethics. They certainly have ethical content, but this content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deals more with desirability of different things than the core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;mechanics&quot; of an ethical system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But doesn't Extropianism give us a handle by which to judge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirability of different world outcomes?  And doesn't this, in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitute an ethical framework?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is true that it does tell us how to get there.  Even if we agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropy is a desirable goal, we may not agree about what are the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical decisions on a day to day basis.
</em><br>
<p>True, but the fact is that the extropian principles DO, in fact
<br>
recognise that there are physical limits on the human animal, imposed by
<br>
evolution, gravity, and other physical laws. We just believe that our
<br>
intelligence gives us the ability to exceed or overcome them as we see
<br>
fit.
<br>
<p>The fact that the principles recognise the existence of limits to break
<br>
implies that extropy recognises the existence of these objective limits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Personally I would say that this is not a flaw. Extropianism rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inherits the ethical underpinnings of its parent philosophies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; libertarianism and humanism (a kind of philosophical object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inheritance); it is compatible with most versions of them, and does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as expressed in the principles have to redo all the immense work that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has been done on expressing ethics and politics elsewhere. It is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like how Robert Nozick simply starts _Anarchy, State, Utopia_ by simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assuming certain rights - the book is not about deriving them, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what conclusions can be made *after* they have been derived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not so comfortable thinking that we can graft conventional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism onto Extropianism, or that we can start with libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics as a foundation for our Extropian ethical system.  Haven't Max
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and others attempted to distance themselves from a strict libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to open the movement to a wider range of political philosophies?
</em><br>
<p>Max and others have distanced themselves from big L libertarianism in
<br>
relation to ExI, but looking at the ExI reading list reflects how
<br>
significant small l libertarian thinkers have been on the formation of
<br>
the principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even in the early days of this list, when most contributors were staunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarians, we explored outside the libertarian box.  We talked about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private law systems where communists who shared everything could live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and work side by side with capitalists who paid a fine for breathing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other guy's air.  We looked at forms of anarchy which were well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the libertarian mainstream.  All this was an attempt to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian goals of self transformation and expansion by giving people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximum freedom to experiment with interpersonal relations and agreements.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, but allowing communists to play their games in a commie
<br>
enclave within a greater libertarian plenum is not bending over to or
<br>
subsuming an overall libertarian perspective in the name of
<br>
multiculturalism. Tolerance is not the same as moral equivalence.
