<em>&gt; &gt; This isn't at all clear to me.  Consider the possibility that the universe

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  Do you suppose,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spike, that people may want to believe in ETs for the same kind of reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they want to believe in deities, ghosts, and goblins?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I suppose thats why some people believe in ETs, but
<br>
my line of reasoning goes thus:
<br>
<p>There are exo-planets, evidently jillions of them.  Since life
<br>
evolved here, its likely life has evolved elsewhere.  Since
<br>
intelligent life evolved here, its likely intelligent life evolved
<br>
elsewhere.  But we cannot see them or hear them.  Why?
<br>
<p>We have kicked around some ideas on how to accomplish
<br>
interstellar travel, and Science Fiction Inc. has suggested
<br>
many schemes, but many of us agree that we have not really
<br>
yet heard a very convincing notion of how this would be
<br>
done.  We have various matter-antimatter propulsion systems,
<br>
multigeneration ships, etc, but we may eventually conclude that
<br>
interstellar travel is *inherently difficult*, a counter example of
<br>
Ray Charles' notion: this task may just be hard, even *after*
<br>
we know how to do it.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, suppose nanotech comes along (it now appears
<br>
inevitable) and we can use that technology to turn the planets
<br>
to M Brains.  Has anyone here any reason to believe that
<br>
Bradburyesque M Brains are inherently impossible?  I dont
<br>
see any reason to think them impossible, not one flimsy
<br>
reason.  But I can think of a lotta reasons why civilizations
<br>
would make them, if they can.  They can.
<br>
<p>If we had orbiting nodes in the form of jillions of flat plates,
<br>
we could arrange to reflect photons all in the same direction,
<br>
instead of radiating in all directions as a star does.  This results
<br>
in a very small but steady thrust.  It also makes the star invisible,
<br>
unless of course one is in the path of exhausted photons.
<br>
<p>Work out the orbit mechanics, observe that one could produce
<br>
a very small but steady acceleration of the entire star, a few
<br>
centimeters per second per year.  It doesnt get you anywhere
<br>
very quickly, but whats the hurry?  Multiply three cm per second
<br>
per year by 10 million years and you have 0.001 c.  You can
<br>
really go places once you get to a milli-c.   Dont build a ship,
<br>
drag the whole continent.
<br>
<p>Your civilization continues on for millions of years, using the
<br>
energy from the star and all the matter available for
<br>
computronium, all the while gently steering a course for...
<br>
where?  Where else but the nearest visible star, particularly
<br>
if that star has metals.  Recall that at 1 milli-c the nearest star
<br>
is only a few thousand years away, a heartbeat in interstellar
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, suppose you are an intelligent lifeform.  Then
<br>
you reason that you want to get to the nearest visible star,
<br>
to use its metals and energy.  But you also know that other
<br>
intelligent lifeform may be using the same line of reasoning
<br>
and have similar technology, and so is gently accelerating
<br>
itself toward you.  You do not wish to encounter another
<br>
lifeform or civilization, because you realize that if the two come
<br>
in contact they must fight.  So you cloak your star as
<br>
quickly as possible.  With advanced nanotech, it wouldnt
<br>
even take that long to do, a few centuries perhaps.  Your
<br>
star would appear to wink out.  Poof!  Here one millennium,
<br>
gone the next.
<br>
<p>After you mask your star and start gently accelerating toward
<br>
the most desirable nearby star, the neighbors will not even
<br>
know for sure in which direction you have begun to move.
<br>
Furthermore, those intelligent lifeforms that evolve after you
<br>
winked out will not even know you are there at all, so would
<br>
not start steering toward you.
<br>
<p>I agree that this scenario has some direct counter evidence,
<br>
such as the existence of *any* visible stars, this long after
<br>
the big bang.  But suppose there is some yet-unknown reason
<br>
for leaving *some* stars uncaptured and uncloaked.  I cannot
<br>
imagine why that would be, however I must take into account
<br>
the fact that I am looking at the question from the point of view
<br>
of a human, a wildly rapacious and aggressive species that only
<br>
very recently became sentient.
<br>
<p>This whole notion sounds very post-Singularity.  In fact it is
<br>
about the only thing post-Singularity that *is* within my very
<br>
limited imagination.
<br>
<p>In any case, I suggest we build our M Brains quickly and get
<br>
sailing towards the next star, before some other extraterrestrial
<br>
yahoo beats us to it.  spike
