<p>Ja well, it is good that people talk about that which they know. {8-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Patterns ... crockery!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another group talked excitedly about &quot;zins&quot; (I soon figured out that was a

</em><br>
<p>I woulda been more lost than anyone at that party.  I drink beer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Maybe it's just the parties I've

</em><br>
<p>Definitely going to the wrong parties Olga. {8-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it seems the more &quot;elegant,&quot; the more boring they've been,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I know why.  People are interesting as a function of their brains,
<br>
not their bank balance.  You need to find some good nerd parties
<br>
Olga.  The nanoschmoozes work pretty well for that.  People
<br>
there don't expect you to know which fork is supposed to be used
<br>
for what purpose.  I never did get up to speed on that kinda thing.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, speaking of zins, I have learned that there is a site
<br>
where one can download one of my faves, Zen and the Art
<br>
of Motorcycle Maintenance.
<br>
<p><a href="http://bonigv.tripod.com/">http://bonigv.tripod.com/</a>
<br>
<p>Ive longed for an ASCII version of this classic, so I can search
<br>
it, instead of having only (as Eliezer so aptly put it) a picture of
<br>
the information.
<br>
<p>How can I find out if Pirsig has granted some yahoo the right
<br>
to post his book?  If he is still holding the copyright, I will dump this
<br>
site right off of my bookmarks.  Since I am a believer in intellectual
<br>
property rights, should I not even mention the site until I can
<br>
determine that it is legitimate?  spike
