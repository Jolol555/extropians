<p><p>I can't speak for your country, but in the U.S. your assumptions would
<br>
simply be wrong.  Nearly all the wealthy people in this country are entirely
<br>
self-made, and the majority of those achieved wealth as blue-collar workers
<br>
who were not born into the vaguest semblance of privilege.  This may not
<br>
square with popular perception, but it is in fact the truth.  Those born
<br>
into &quot;the richer classes&quot; as you are painting them are almost a non-existent
<br>
class here and largely irrelevant as they are vastly outnumbered by more
<br>
&quot;deserving&quot; folk of similar economic means.
<br>
<p>People use rhetoric like yours about a vanishingly small class of people to
<br>
pass laws that exact punitive measures largely against self-made blue-collar
<br>
people of modest background.  That is like putting a hundred men in prison
<br>
to make sure that the five criminals among them are also in prison.
