<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Obviously for the Extropians, mediation per se cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; defined as &quot;impurity&quot; or as the invariable source of separation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; alienation, and hierarchy. Nevertheless, it remains obvious that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such separation does in fact occur
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Translated, this would mean that extropians do not see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological mediation - our technological exoselves that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interface us with the world and each other through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;telecommunications, cars, prepackaged food and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glasses - as an inevitable source of separation from the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world and each other. This is contrary to what primitivists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;romantics, luddites, marxists and many other critics of modernity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claim. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, but it's just that, a &quot;claim&quot;. This is different from fact.
<br>
Bey claims that such separation is a fact, it is not, but just his
<br>
claim.
<br>
<p>Rather than a neutral position, this statement reeks of an anti-
<br>
technological bias...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think at the core this is due to a different sense of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meaning and importance of authenticity: to us authentic means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something entirely different from the very much nature-linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense the term is used by them. I think most of us would say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a life as a posthuman upload in a nanotech Dyson sphere is just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;authentic as living as a hunter gatherer in the paleolithic; it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more about a subjective sense of identity than anything rooted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical or metaphysical reality. To us, the mood change brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about by Prozac is just as authentic as the same change brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about by therapy (we can still recognize that a cognitive therapy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making a person better able to cope and control his emotions will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the long run be preferrable to a &quot;chemical fix&quot;, it is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the mood itself has its own authenticity). In the end I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our position can be viewed as &quot;authenticity is information&quot;, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many of our critics think that &quot;authenticity is in the object&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p><p><p>I think it's even simpler, our critics consider their's the only
<br>
authentic position.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;However, authenticity is also - especially in marxist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existentialist discourse - closely linked to social aspects. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is what Bey continues with:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; that it amounts to immiseration, that it is bound up in some way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with techn? and mediation, that not all technology is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;liberating&quot; according to any anarchist definition of the term,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and that some of it is downright oppressive. The Extropian  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; therefore lacks and needs a critique of technology, and of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incredibly complex relation between the social and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; technical. No one with any intelligence can any longer accept 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the notion of technology as &quot;morally neutral,&quot; with control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the means of production the only criteria for valuation. The  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; social and the technological are somehow bound in a complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; relation of co-creation (or &quot;co-evolution&quot;), such that techn? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; shapes cognition even as cognition shapes techn?.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Bey means roughly that technology (and he means it in its widest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense, not just special devices but also &quot;technologies&quot; such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economics and psychology) is not value-neutral, but that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology has inherent consequences that are ethically relevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In his analysis this is not due to anything directly inherent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the technology itself, but rather in the fact that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible to separate technology from the social environment -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economy, culture, politics and all that. Technology is developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because of what humans think and want, and these things are bound
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up to our society; the new technology changes society, and we get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a complex tangle of feedback where everything does have ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implications. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I wasn't aware that anyone here thought that technology is value
<br>
neutral. I most certainly don't. I don't see anything in the
<br>
Extropian principals that says technology is value neutral. 
<br>
<p>Under Intelligent Technology:
<br>
<p>&quot;Seeing technology not as an end in itself but as an effective
<br>
means towards the improvement of life&quot;
<br>
<p>We understand the risks involved, we accept them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree with him about this. Seeing technology as something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cleanly separated from society, something that develops on its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;according to its own rules, does not work - the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology shows that it is always deeply involved in the messy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process of cultural change. This is not anything deterministic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and individual humans can and do affect it a lot, which means it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has ethical implications. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree also, but I don't see where he gets the idea that
<br>
Extropians think technology is value neutral. We understand culture
<br>
and society. We also understand they are flawed, and a rational
<br>
approach to improving them is the best solution.
<br>
<p>Nor do we intend to be limited by them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Unfortunately quite a few transhumanists do tend towards fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simplistic technological determinism or separate technology from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its cultural side, and this produces an inability to do a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;critique of technology. If technology is just something bringing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us towards a future utopia on its own, then technology is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good and there is no point in further debate about whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Microsoft's software is a good thing. If the value of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is determined solely by the values of those bringing it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence and the applications it is put to, then it is impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to criticise secondary effects (is it a good thing that we can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constantly reached using cellphones, and a culture assuming this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems to be emerging?). 
</em><br>
<p><p>Again I agree, but this is supposed to be about Extropians, not
<br>
merely transhumanists, and I still don't see us as being value
<br>
neutral toward technology.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt; If the extropian vision of the future is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; viable it cannot depend on &quot;machine evolution&quot; alone to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; realization. But unless anarcho-futurism can develop a critique
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of technology, it is relegated precisely to this passive role.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Which I also agree with. We will not get to transhumanity just by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inventing the right tools, we have to change ourselves and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture too. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this also, but I also think he is wrong about us on
<br>
this point, the Extropian principals clearly state that more than
<br>
tech is involved. How about the open society principal?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; On the other hand, I prefer the burden of inconsistency (even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;foolish&quot; inconsistency) to the burden of the Absolute. Only an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impure theory can  do justice to the impurity of the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-which, as everyone knows, is  only a psychological impossibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;caught between a lost past and a nonexistent future.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I.e., beware of oversimplified utopias where everything is black
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and white. Such thinking requires you to do away with all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present world and to remake it into something completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different. It has a hard time being tolerant and pluralistic, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can very easily turn into something totalitarian. 
</em><br>
<p><p>We are not Utopianists...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Suppose we were to ask -as anarchists- what should be done about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the problem of technology &quot;after the revolution.&quot; This exercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in utopian poetics may help us to clarify the question of desire,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and of praxis in  the &quot;present.&quot; The primitivist might argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;there can be no  revolution without the abolition of symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mediation, or at least of  the technological imperative;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;extropians might say that no revolution can occur without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technological transcendence. But both parties must perforce admit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a transitional stage, when de facto power has been seized by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Revolution,&quot; but the full unfolding of revolutionary society has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;yet to occur. Let's imagine that the one rough principle agreed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;upon by &quot;everyone&quot; is the freedom of the individual from coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;by the group, and the freedom of the (self-organized) group from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;coercion by all other groups. The only &quot;price&quot; of this freedom is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that it damage no other free and autonomous interests.
</em><br>
....
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I suspect that this &quot;utopia&quot; would prove disappointing to both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the primitives and the extropians. I suspect that a workable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;utopia would adhere more closely to the &quot;messy&quot; model than to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;either of the &quot;pure&quot; models of the pro-tech/anti-tech theorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Like bolo'bolo, I imagine a complex multiplicity of social models
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;co-existing under the voluntary aegis of the social &quot;price&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mutual non-coercion. In effect the primitivists will get less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wilderness than they demand, and the extropians will get less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;tech.
</em><br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;This is a very good thought experiment (and as such, a crutch for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking rather than a recipe of How To Do It). His point is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if we somehow manage to overturn the current situation and create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essentially an anarchist world (his description seems a bit like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my ideas about metafederations and Nozick's utopia, a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;composed of communities with their own internal rules and much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom to move between them) the world will not become a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primitive utopia or a posthuman utopia. It would likely be a messy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mixture of both - there would be extropians pursuing supertech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and right next to them the local luddites trying to live a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neomedieval life. But neither would get the pure world: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;luddites would find themselves using some neat tech or having to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept the existence of GM plants, the extropians would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept both a large number of people not interested in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;visions and a slower rate of progress than would have been if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everybody had been trying to storm the cosmos. 
</em><br>
<p><p><p>We are not utopianists. We don't care how others choose to live
<br>
their lives, we just want to pursue the improvement of ours. This
<br>
is the difference between us and the luddites, we are willing to
<br>
leave them alone, but they are unwilling to leave us alone.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;Bey seem to be optimistic about that this is feasible, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may be is own utopian flight of fancy. After all, getting from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here to there will not be a clean break if it happens, but in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself a messy imperfect process. It could very well be that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still will have some of our old insitutions even after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Revolution - there might be a Microsoft even then - and it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely not be as perfectly anarchist or nice as we would like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which is acceptable, because the alternative is to seek a perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolution which is impossible to realize in the real world. 
</em><br>
<p><p><p>I think this whole essay is colored by Bey's misinterpretation of
<br>
Extropianism. He attempts to lump us in with transhumanists and
<br>
other assorted futurists. It's almost impossible to believe he has
<br>
actually read the Extropian principals. He also appears to be anti-
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>Still it was interesting.
