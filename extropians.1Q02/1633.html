<em>&gt; &gt;Subject: I Want To Disbelieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 21 Jan 2002 19:03:10 -0500
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This article was printed in Portfolio Weekly (January 22nd issue) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;written by D.D. Delaney.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I Want To Disbelieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;PAT ROBERTSON, take note. A young man has come to Virginia Beach with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mission to make the world safe for atheists and free-thinking secular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;humanists, and his organizational model is the Christian Coalition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Clint O'Dell is just getting started, but, like Pat before him, he hopes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;go far. He has a vision of a global Atheist Coalition, with its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;broadcasting system, charities, and a political agenda to defeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;faith-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;legislative initiatives and elect atheists to high office.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Describing himself, at 23, as &quot;the youngest atheist activist there is,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are younger--Micah White, for instance....but who cares?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure there are many in the various atheist communitites who are of 
<br>
his age.  Not in leading roles, anyways.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;O'Dell believes there is an atheist awakening dawning in America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'm hoping to pick up (that) slow-moving ball,&quot; he says, &quot;put it in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cannon, strike a match, and set off that cannon.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That is going to be MIGHTY slow mover...but we ahve to start somewhere.
</em><br>
<p>It does seem to have picked up recently.  The results of a recent study 
<br>
showing that &quot;non-believers&quot; were a larger portion of the U.S. population 
<br>
than previously thought may help some (estimated at 37 Million, IIRC).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In partnership with like-minded Lauren Floyd of Chesapeake, he has put out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;call for all doubters, skeptics, and non-believers to attend the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;meeting of Freethinkers and Atheists of Virginia on Sunday, Jan. 27, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1-3 p.m. in the auditorium of the Virginia Beach Central Library.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The organization's purpose, O'Dell says, is to achieve legitimacy for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;atheism and &quot;to promote secular values.&quot; Membership is open to &quot;anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is for helping to make America become more secular.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;We have no idea&quot; how many people might turn out for the first meeting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Floyd, who, at 43, is O'Dell's senior partner in the start-up. &quot;Getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;atheists to join a group is kind of like trying to herd cats. They're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;typically individualists, suspicious of any organized group.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Atheists have been the subject iof a few studies; one recent one said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atheists were by nature less dependent on other people. So therefore they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are not joiners; therefore they do not organize....
</em><br>
<p>True, but then look at this list, and &gt;Humanism/Extropianism in 
<br>
general.  I'd wager the greater percentage here are non-believers.  People 
<br>
here have been speaking of others here as &quot;family&quot;, myself included.
<br>
<p>I don't think atheists are particularly bad &quot;joiners&quot;.  I think they need a 
<br>
very good idea to rally behind, and compelling reason to do it, which are 
<br>
perhaps things that haven't been available in the past.  Also, there seems 
<br>
to be something of a self-reinforced &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy in the 
<br>
non-believeing community, where people see it as unwise or unimportant to 
<br>
be openly non-believing.  After all, no Christian would think twice about 
<br>
professing his faith.  Atheists in some places, need to stop and think 
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p>I wonder if 9/11 has something to do with this &quot;atheist awakening&quot;, if such 
<br>
in fact exists?  Perhaps the religious resurgence resulting has stepped on 
<br>
a few too many infidel toes?
<br>

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
