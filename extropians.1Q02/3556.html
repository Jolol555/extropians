<p><p>The ceramic plates flatten and fragment rifle bullets.  The slower and

less ballistically efficient shape post-ceramic is easily stopped by the

vest underneath.
<br>
<p>Contrary to what Michael Lorrey stated, they will NOT stop AP (armor
<br>
penetrating) rifle bullets.  Part of the confusion is that marketing
<br>
types sell ammo as &quot;AP&quot; which was never designed as such by the
<br>
military, but which they can charge a premium for when selling to the
<br>
gullible public. This fake AP ammo can be stopped by armor vests.  Real
<br>
AP has never been available to the public and it is in fact illegal to
<br>
own true AP ammo.  The real clue that this is the case should be that
<br>
the ATF does not crack down on the myriad of &quot;AP&quot; ammo vendors.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyone know what kind of legislation governs the private production of
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; directed energy weapons, hipower lasers, or directed emp weapons? On a
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; related note, does the legislation on automatic and explosive firearms
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; cover privately developed, prototype, or handbuilt non-commercial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons?
</em><br>
<p><p>The rules are complicated.  In the U.S., any weapon that doesn't require
<br>
a Form 4 transfer can legally be manufactured without licensing of any
<br>
type as long as you only do it for personal use and experimentation.
<br>
Building restricted weapons requires a license called a Form 2 (IIRC),
<br>
but once they give it to you (and it is essentially a &quot;shall issue&quot;
<br>
form) you can make almost anything you want.  In conjunction with this,
<br>
you would probably want to fill out the form that gives you carte
<br>
blanche to do anything you want with explosives.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem you are likely to have is in the category of Form 4
<br>
device classified as &quot;Destructive Devices&quot;, which is a rather open-ended
<br>
definition although there are some regulatory guidelines.  However, a
<br>
proper Form 2 and broad explosives license should cover everything I
<br>
would think.
<br>
<p>And last but not least, most of these regulations apply only to Natural
<br>
Persons.  It is a moderately well-known loophole that a Corporation (and
<br>
agents of the corporation) are not subject to many/most of these
<br>
regulations.
