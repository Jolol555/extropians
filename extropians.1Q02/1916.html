<p><p>To Learn What People Want, Trade 'Idea Stocks'
<br>
<p><p>By BARNABY J. FEDER
<br>
<p><p>SOUTH POMFRET, Vt. -- BUSINESS students from the Massachusetts Institute of
<br>
Technology, participating in a mock stock exchange at a vacation lodge
<br>
here, received instant feedback from the wireless network that linked them.
<br>
As the 30 or so traders pecked away tensely on their laptop computers,
<br>
sighs and nervous giggles signaled the gyrating value of their portfolios.
<br>
<p>Except for its unusually informal setting, this recent exercise looked like
<br>
the kind of simulated trading of stocks or bonds that is routine in the
<br>
finance curriculum at many business schools.
<br>
<p>But this was a marketing class conducted by Ely Dahan, a professor at
<br>
M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Business. The students were not trading securities
<br>
but the traits of various goods and services, like automobiles and ski
<br>
resorts. The exercise was part of an effort by Professor Dahan and
<br>
colleagues at M.I.T. to prove that simulated trading could answer that most
<br>
basic of all product development questions: What do consumers want?
<br>
<p>One session here traded &quot;stocks&quot; representing the Pontiac Aztek, Acura MDX
<br>
and other rivals in the new market segment that melds sport utility
<br>
vehicles, minivans and cars. The students also traded the characteristics
<br>
of ski resorts - whether skiers could drive to the resort or had to fly to
<br>
it, for example, and whether it had crowded slopes. Other sessions focused
<br>
on designs for laptop-computer carrying cases and variations on hand-held
<br>
digital assistants.
<br>
<p>In as little as 20 minutes, the students arrived at fairly stable rankings
<br>
of the relative worth of what they were trading. More intriguingly, as was
<br>
driven home by interviews with skiers nearby at Mount Killington, the
<br>
relative values arrived at through the trading closely paralleled consumer
<br>
preferences divined much more laboriously through traditional field
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's amazing that you can get effective results in areas where people
<br>
don't know that much,&quot; said Jay Livens, an M.I.T. student, after Professor
<br>
Dahan showed the outcomes of their vehicle trading.
<br>
<p>The closing prices were generally consistent both with consumer sentiments
<br>
culled from more traditional market research and with previous trading
<br>
experiments conducted at M.I.T. In just minutes, for example, the trading
<br>
showed disappointment with the Aztek and enthusiasm for the MDX in
<br>
proportions similar to those of car buyers over the last year. &quot;General
<br>
Motors (news/quote) might have been able to save itself a lot of pain if it
<br>
had run trading like this a couple of years ago,&quot; Professor Dahan said.
<br>
<p>To participants, market research had never seemed so much fun - or cool.
<br>
<p>&quot;I feel like we are at the genesis of a potentially great idea,&quot; said
<br>
Kristina Larson, a first-year student.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
N real markets, the value that buyers place on goods - reflected in prices
<br>
- is established as a byproduct of the exchange of goods. In Professor
<br>
Dahan's markets, buyers' opinions are the whole point of the exercise. If
<br>
the operations of regular markets are like fishing for food, then Professor
<br>
Dahan is fishing to collect data from the fish about pollution levels in
<br>
the ocean.
<br>
<p>Professor Dahan's research was inspired by the earlier successes of several
<br>
Internet- based trading exchanges that have been called &quot;decision markets&quot;
<br>
by Robin Hanson, an economics professor at George Mason University. The
<br>
most renowned one, the Iowa Electronic Markets, has often outperformed
<br>
pollsters in predicting election results. The market, operated by the Henry
<br>
B. Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa, permits investors
<br>
to buy and sell shares in a candidate, based either on how much of the vote
<br>
they expect the candidate to receive or simply on whether the candidate
<br>
will win or lose. Under a special clearance from the Securities and
<br>
Exchange Commission, the market accepts investments of up to $500, giving
<br>
participants an incentive to invest seriously without running afoul of laws
<br>
that ban gambling.
<br>
<p>Another virtual market, the Hollywood Stock Exchange (www.hsx.com), has
<br>
become one of the movie industry's most trusted predictors of how new films
<br>
will perform at the box office. The exchange has more than 850,000
<br>
registered members. After completing the free registration form, traders
<br>
get two million &quot;Hollywood dollars.&quot; They base their &quot;investments&quot; on how
<br>
they expect a film to perform in its first four weeks at the box office,
<br>
months before the film even opens. Each Hollywood dollar equals $1 million
<br>
of film revenue. If a film is trading based on expectations that it will
<br>
gross $80 million in its first four weeks, investors who think it will
<br>
reach $100 million buy shares. Those who anticipate weaker results sell.
<br>
<p>The Hollywood Stock Exchange, owned by a British subsidiary of Cantor
<br>
Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm, sells data about the trading to
<br>
entertainment companies.
<br>
<p>Several companies have experimented internally with similar trading
<br>
programs. The most successful reported experiment, Professor Hanson said,
<br>
was at Hewlett-Packard (news/quote). Predictions of Unix workstation sales,
<br>
derived from trading shares in different projections by Hewlett-Packard
<br>
sales managers, repeatedly proved more accurate than official estimates by
<br>
the unit's marketing group. The trading apparently filtered out the
<br>
tendency of sales executives to be optimistic in their projections to
<br>
superiors.
<br>
<p>Professor Dahan is trying to forecast the appeal of competing packages of
<br>
product features, some of which may never exist other than as ideas. Such
<br>
trading cannot be measured against a real outcome, as in an election. But
<br>
the trading of product attributes may help a business pick the most popular
<br>
combinations of features early in the design process.
<br>
<p>Trading contests may also help a company find consumers who are especially
<br>
knowledgeable about its business - or one in which the company wants to
<br>
expand. Such consumers, called lead users, are prized in the product
<br>
development world.
<br>
<p>Professor Dahan's main goal is to permit product developers to do research
<br>
that is fast, easily modified and ultimately much more thorough. The
<br>
technique now viewed as the best, a polling practice called conjoint
<br>
analysis, was developed in the late 1960's. Marriott used it to design its
<br>
Courtyard by Marriott chain (the slogan: designed by business travelers for
<br>
business travelers).
<br>
<p>But conjoint analysis for more than a few attributes is unwieldy because
<br>
the possible combinations quickly mushroom to unmanageable numbers. That is
<br>
a big shortcoming in a world where many products have more than 100
<br>
distinguishable features that might influence consumers, Professor Dahan
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>In theory, trading can establish simultaneous values for scores or even
<br>
hundreds of product attributes - just as it does each day for thousands of
<br>
publicly listed stocks. That assumes that large groups of people are
<br>
willing to trade for fun or for modest rewards.
<br>
<p>But Professor Dahan, 44, is a cautious champion. He began investigating
<br>
stock trading at the suggestion of another M.I.T. professor, Andrew Lo, a
<br>
finance expert, as part of Professor Dahan's work on M.I.T.'s Virtual
<br>
Customer Initiative. That research seeks ways to use the Internet and other
<br>
tools to speed product development. &quot;Andrew has far more confidence in the
<br>
accuracy of markets than I do,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think businesses will be trading these stocks like crazy in the future,
<br>
but this is just a complement to other techniques,&quot; Professor Dahan added.
<br>
&quot;It would be heresy among marketing academics to say we no longer need to
<br>
measure individual preferences. Trading doesn't reflect them.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
PROFESSOR DAHAN said research suggested that in 38 percent of the trades,
<br>
sellers like the specific products or features more than the buyer.
<br>
Presumably, the sellers unload the stock because they think the price will
<br>
fall.
<br>
<p>But how often game traders will behave as normal financial investors is one
<br>
of many areas about which little is known. Other questions include what
<br>
rewards are needed to keep enough traders playing and how to determine
<br>
winners.
<br>
<p>Professor Hanson says he thinks the biggest hurdles to the spread of
<br>
research- driven trading in business may be cultural. Companies
<br>
continuously make investments based on assumptions about the future that
<br>
are, in essence, bets. But stock trading is so obviously speculative that
<br>
many of them may be reluctant to be seen using a form of it as a data
<br>
source for important decisions.
