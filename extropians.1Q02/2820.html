1. I **still** do not know what negative experience you had. Remember *** I
<br>
am not attacking you but really wish to know**
<br>
Mentioning that through you work, you came to be in contact with users
<br>
or/and addicts or that one of your business partner was a cocaine user, does
<br>
not give me any info whatsoever on  what negative experience might have come
<br>
out of it.
<br>
<p>2. I am asking you to incriminate yourself ? I was not aware of it. I happen
<br>
to be someone that feely discuss just about anything with just about anyone.
<br>
Just because I am asking you something which you wouldn't want to be known,
<br>
does not imply that I am 'asking you to incriminate yourself'. Why are you
<br>
feeling attacked ? Why leave it at that ?
<br>
<p>I really read all your previous posts in this thread and I still do not know
<br>
what exact experiences gave you the knowledge which you seem to have. I want
<br>
concrete stuff, examples, something that can widen my map. Something I can
<br>
grind on. Is that wrong ?
<br>
<p>Arona,
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Greetings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I ask to Mike Lorrey:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What negative experience have you had with drugs ? (directly or
</em><br>
indirectly)
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Have you ever used any ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have used alcohol on an irregular basis since I was a teenager, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caffeine as well. I don't smoke tobacco, and as for the rest, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking me to incriminate myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the answer to the first question is anything but &quot;none&quot;, please
</em><br>
share. We
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are here to discuss, not to destroy other's arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the answer to the second question is 'no', it would be wise for you
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'chill' when discussing that topic. You're not knowledgeable enough on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; topic at hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am quite knowledgable and experienced, and I will leave it at that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And just reading books and papers don't mean shit in this case. You
</em><br>
cannot
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'attack' users without having been one and you cannot attack them AFTER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; having been one yourself. If you just have a pretty 'tough' stance but
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not explain why, people might label you as a 'troll', just like it's
</em><br>
done
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on Slashdot on in newsgroups/mailing lists etc... I'm sure you actually
</em><br>
want
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to discuss things, don't you ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In that case, you still need to start...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the typical first attack of opponents to my arguments, the &quot;you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must have never used drugs if you think this way&quot; routine. If you had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually read my previous posts, you would not be even making such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ludicrous statements. In which case, I can say that your statements are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthless until you actually DO read what I've already said.
