<p>When you get to the point in your frustration that you begin
<br>
swearing at an inanimate object, yes, you've lost control.
<br>
You are flustered to the point where you have stopped reasoning,
<br>
which is why you're expressing anger at an inanimate object,
<br>
that can't be changed by simple verbal expression of anger
<br>
towards it.  Any reasonable person can see that.  :-)
<br>
<p>I didn't say that just because you swear that you're incapable
<br>
of reason.  What I said was, when you (or anyone for that
<br>
matter) gets to the point when all they can manage is swearing,
<br>
then they have exhuasted their mental fortitude and they
<br>
are on &quot;mental auto-pilot&quot; letting their baser instincts
<br>
govern their pattern of speech.  It's a clear sign that
<br>
they're mentally exhausted of reasonable things to do or
<br>
say.
<br>
<p>As a programmer (today), when I start to get to that point,
<br>
I get up, go outside, smoke a cigarette or two, and let my
<br>
brain recuperate.  I come back inside, refreshed, and I
<br>
usually solve whatever problem I was facing fairly quickly
<br>
and simply.  Yet another reason why I will continue to
<br>
smoke, regardless of the anti-smoking propaganda.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its like the hundred years war all over again.  I wonder when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various factions sides will finally get it that neither side can win.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, sadly, email flamewars are wars of attrition.  Indeed, nobody
<br>
wins, but there comes a point when there is &quot;one man left standing.&quot;
<br>
<p>Will that one man please turn the lights off before they leave?
