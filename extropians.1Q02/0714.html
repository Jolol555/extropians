</em><br>
<p>Exactly. I was talking about long-term effects. That people get happy
<br>
when they win and may become more optimistic (just as people subjected 
<br>
to a disaster often develop a negative life-outlook) is a no-brainer. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.psych.umn.edu/psylabs/happness/hapindex.htm">http://www.psych.umn.edu/psylabs/happness/hapindex.htm</a> :
<br>
<p>Psychologists David Myers, at Hope College, and Ed and Carol Diener at
<br>
the University of Illinois have been studying SWB for years with
<br>
remarkable results. They find first that SWB is essentially unrelated to
<br>
socioeconomic status, to income, to level of education, to gender or to
<br>
race. We have replicated all but the race findings (fewer than 2% of
<br>
births in Minnesota are to minority parents so that our twin samples are
<br>
almost exclusively Caucasian). Those who ride to work in overalls and on
<br>
the bus are just as happy on average as those in suits and ties who
<br>
drive in their Mercedes. Although men still have a tenuous hold on the
<br>
reins of power, women's average SWB is at least as high as men's (this
<br>
is especially surprising since we know that clinical depression is far
<br>
more prevalent in women).
<br>
<p>Second, to explain these curious results, the Illinois researchers have
<br>
shown that the effects on current SWB of both positive and negative life
<br>
events are largely gone after just 3 months and undetectable after 6
<br>
months. A happiness reading on a victim of a spinal injury---or on a
<br>
winner in the lottery---taken a year after the event, is likely to give
<br>
about the same value obtained before the event. Most people, within 6
<br>
months or so, will have adapted back to their genetically-determined
<br>
set-point. Getting that promotion, having Miss or Mr. Right say &quot;Yes&quot;,
<br>
even having a &quot;born again&quot; religious conversion---each of these may send
<br>
the happiness meter right off the scale for a while but, in a few
<br>
months, it will drift back to the set-point that is normal for that
<br>
individual. (Perhaps this is why evangelicals have annual &quot;revival&quot;
<br>
meetings---to revive their faith and also their feelings of subjective
<br>
well-being.)
<br>
<p>One further replicated finding is that most people's happiness set-point
<br>
is above zero, that is, on the happy side of neutral. Nearly 87% of some
<br>
2,300 middle-aged twins in our sample rated themselves to be in the
<br>
upper third in over-all, long-term contentment. It seems plausible to
<br>
suppose that, over the millennia of human evolution, those ancients who
<br>
were grouchy or sad did less well in the struggle for survival and had
<br>
less luck in the mating game. Our species has become biased toward
<br>
positive well-being by natural selection.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Now, however, we can factor in the finding that happiness is virtually
<br>
uncorrelated with income or socioeconomic status. One can predict a
<br>
person's SWB far more accurately from his identical cotwin's score even
<br>
ten years earlier than from that person's income, professional status,
<br>
or social position today. Those favored genetically by high IQs are
<br>
indeed more likely to become doctors, lawyers, or chieftains of industry
<br>
than are those destined to be plumbers or garbage collectors---but those
<br>
clever ones are not likely to end up any happier.
<br>
<p><a href="http://s.psych.uiuc.edu/~ediener/hottopic/NEW_DIRECTIONS.html">http://s.psych.uiuc.edu/~ediener/hottopic/NEW_DIRECTIONS.html</a> :
<br>
<p>One of the broad conclusions from much of the Stage 1 research is that
<br>
demographic variables are not very powerful in explaining the variance
<br>
in SWB. For example, Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers (1976) discovered
<br>
that demographic factors (e.g., age, sex, education, marital status)
<br>
accounted for less than 20% of the variance in SWB. Andrews and Withey
<br>
(1976) could only predict 8% of the variability in life satisfaction
<br>
using demographic variables; and Argyle (1999) concluded that
<br>
demographic variables could account for only 15% of the variance in SWB. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.teachpositivepsych.org/subjwellbeing.htm">http://www.teachpositivepsych.org/subjwellbeing.htm</a> : 
<br>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, well-being does not rise when income rises.
<br>
Wealth does not mean well-being - According to University of Michigan
<br>
researcher Ronald Inglehart (as cited in Myers, 1993), people from
<br>
wealthier countries report higher levels of well-being than those in
<br>
poorer countries on average, but levels of well-being differ from
<br>
country to country. West Germans average twice as much personal income
<br>
as those of the Irish, but the Irish report being happier. The same can
<br>
be seen with the wealthier French as compared to their Belgian
<br>
neighbors. Within countries, the richer are not always happier. Living
<br>
in abject poverty does not promote happiness, but having more than one
<br>
needs has little effect on one's well-being. Diener and colleagues
<br>
(Diener, Horowitz and Emmons, 1985) interviewed 49 of the wealthiest
<br>
Americans as listed by Forbes magazine and found them to be only
<br>
slightly happier than average.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Health does not correlate with well-being. How people view their health
<br>
depends on their emotional state and objective measures of their health
<br>
from doctors (Diener, Suh, Lucas, &amp; Smith, 1999). People generally need
<br>
a basic level of health wherein pain does not interfere with activities
<br>
(Williamson, 1998). People with high levels of well-being and hope
<br>
usually return to normal levels of well-being after unpleasant diagnoses
<br>
of illness (Synder, 2000). The exception to this rule is for people with
<br>
multiple disabling conditions. Although their well-being goes up after
<br>
initial diagnosis, they usually do not return to normal levels of
<br>
well-being that were present before diagnosis.  
<br>
<p>Haven't read this, but it seems interesting anyway:

&quot;Measuring global progress through subjective well-being&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Scientific method = device for accurately identifying incorrect thinking.
</em><br>
<p>This is another thread, but I would like to point out that 1) whether it
<br>
is universally accurate is strongly debated, 2) it is not applicable to
<br>
all situations, 3) it is not very efficient in dealing with qualitative
<br>
data. As an example, how do you apply science to accurately identify
<br>
whether the claim &quot;Captain Ahab was gay&quot; is an incorrect conclusion from
<br>
melville's _Moby Dick_?
