<p><p>Irrelevant, and inaccurate in any case (at least as it applies to U.S. armor
<br>
systems, which are none too shabby).  Modern body armor will only stop
<br>
&quot;penetration enhanced&quot; rifle bullets (what they sell to civilians as &quot;AP&quot;).
<br>
These bullets are designed such that they can penetrate a layer of hard
<br>
material (masonry, a car door, etc.) and still be in sufficiently good shape
<br>
to penetrate a person wearing flak armor.  Ordinary lead bullets
<br>
disintegrate upon hitting the first hard material, which means that many
<br>
times you can't shoot at someone using cinder blocks as cover; the bullet
<br>
may make it, but it will be in such poor condition that it won't produce an
<br>
effective wound.  Enhanced penetration bullets were designed to deny certain
<br>
kinds of cover while still nominally behaving like ordinary bullets.  They
<br>
still have a lead core, but have a mild steel tip that offers some
<br>
protection for the lead core and allows the bullet to still be mostly
<br>
effective after penetrating a layer of hard material.
<br>
<p>Real AP is a completely different animal, as it radically modifies the
<br>
sectional density and sectional energy profile to vastly increase the
<br>
penetration.  The kinds of armor required to counteract the physics involved
<br>
would be too heavy to be usable as body armor.
<br>
<p>And while some heavy armor systems use ceramic composites, it isn't the same
<br>
kind used in body armor.  In fact, most of the advanced composite armor that
<br>
I can think of is designed specifically to counter shaped-charge type
<br>
anti-armor weapons and not kinetic energy anti-armor weapons, which is what
<br>
we are talking about here.  Body armor systems are constrained by weight and
<br>
size as a primary factor, whereas these are not issues on a tank.  It
<br>
therefore makes sense that the design parameters are substantially different
<br>
both in the practical logistical aspects and the types of armor penetration
<br>
modes they have to contend with, so it shouldn't be surprising that the
<br>
apparent relationship between tank armor and body armor is mostly
<br>
superficial.
