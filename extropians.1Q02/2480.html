Ok. Synopsis of 4FEB02 Investor Release from Metabolic Pharmaceuticals Ltd 
<br>
re:AOD9604 Phase 2A Human Clinical Trials.
<br>
<p>Four week human trial of an anti-obesity drug administered intravenously to 
<br>
assess various parameters, including safety and efficacy.
<br>
<p>&quot;...AOD9604...acts specifically on the body's fat cells to enhance the 
<br>
breakdown of stored fats and inhibit the synthesis of new fat....The drug 
<br>
is modelled on the fat reducing portion of the hGH (human growth hormone) 
<br>
molecule.&quot;
<br>
<p>The drug shows significant fat-reducing results in an ~45yo population 
<br>
subset, whereas no significant reduction in the ~25yo subset. Confirms hGH 
<br>
mimicry as the 45yo group would be expected to have declining levels of 
<br>
hGH, with the likelihood of being more responsive to artificially induced 
<br>
metabolic up-regulation.
<br>
<p>In treating age-onset obesity, the drug appears to be an effective 
<br>
candidate for the targeted clientele. It avoids the overall weight gain 
<br>
that is seen in hGH supplementation due to increased mass in muscle, organ 
<br>
and bone.
<br>
<p>==============================================
<br>
Aside.
<br>
There already exists data that demonstrates that eliminating obesity 
<br>
oftentimes/usually resolves the coexisting Type II diabetes, high blood 
<br>
pressure and increased frequency of cardiovascular events. Surgical 
<br>
intervention in the morbidly obese via an improved &quot;stomach-stapling&quot; 
<br>
procedure has shown dramatic results in improved patient outcome. 
<br>
[Evidence-based appropriate care]
<br>
<p>With AOD9604 issues of cost, coverage and compliance will be interesting to 
<br>
follow.
<br>
<p>Insurance companies are already assessing pro-rating drug co-pays by 
<br>
categorizing/classifying clients on different protocols according to 
<br>
prognosis in order to minimize costs while maximizing outcomes. Also, 
<br>
big-brother may become a retroactive Siamese twin as compliance monitoring 
<br>
may drive reimbursement payments for increasingly costly drugs cluttering 
<br>
unopened medicine cabinets.
<br>
<p>Of course, if Metabolic can put AOD9604 in a can of diet Coke and a bag of 
<br>
chips, perhaps I should give my broker a call!
<br>
<p>Ahhh! The fluoride of the *new* millennium.
<br>
