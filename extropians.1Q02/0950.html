<p><em>&gt;such which never developed the wheel. Why? You could say because their

<p>If you want to define round things turning on roads as the be-all and end-all
<br>
of human civilization, be prepared for other people like me to have different
<br>
definitions.  Any group that can organize millions of people to perform large
<br>
-scale public works over an area over a thousand miles long, leaving extensive
<br>
accounting records and performing complex rituals is a civilization in my
<br>
book.  I don't consider not using the wheel for jungle and mountain transport
<br>
when there never was any good animal to pull carts in the first place of
<br>
substantial importance.  It was military applications that drove the 
<br>
development
<br>
of wheeled transport, and llama chariots on mountains slopes just don't cut
<br>
the mustard.  Wheeled transport wasn't particularly useful prior to the 
<br>
railroad,
<br>
anyway; it had its place but most transport went by water.
