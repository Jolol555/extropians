<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Question #5: What has been the experience of nations that have mixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men and women in combat units? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer: History shows that the presence of women has had a devastating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact on the effectiveness of men in battle. For example, it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common misperception that Israel allows women in combat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; units. In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women have been barred from combat in Israel since 1950, when a review
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War showed how harmful their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence could be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study revealed that men tried to protect and assist women rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue their attack. As a result, they not only put their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own lives in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater danger, but also jeopardized the survival of the entire unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The study further revealed that unit morale was damaged when men saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women killed and maimed on the battlefield. (Presidential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Commission on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, International 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trip Report,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; September 14-27, 1992.) &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It sounds like the men behave terribly erratically, and can't take the
<br>
environment of mixed gender combat units. Also, they do seem to be a
<br>
distraction to the women. Maybe it's not such a good idea to allow men in
<br>
combat roles, given this?
