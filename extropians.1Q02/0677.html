J. Hughes provides a pointer to his article at
<br>
<a href="http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm">http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm</a>.  Others have done
<br>
a good job pointing out some of the flaws and errors, but I want to pursue
<br>
the question of whether and how transhumanism can be politically agnostic.
<br>
<p>The original Extropian Principles are quoted as:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boundless expansion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-transformation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic optimism
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligent technology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spontaneous order
<br>
<p>It's the last one which seems controversial to people: &quot;Supporting
<br>
decentralized, voluntaristic social coordination processes. Fostering
<br>
tolerance, diversity, foresight, personal responsibility and individual
<br>
liberty.&quot;  Unthreatening as these goals would seem, they do nevertheless
<br>
imply a social order which is different from what we see today.
<br>
Our governments rely on centralized and involuntary (coercion-based)
<br>
social coordination.  Challenging this orthodoxy brought the Extropian
<br>
Principles into line with libertarian thought, which was anathema to
<br>
many who were otherwise interested in transhumanism.
<br>
<p>However there are libertarian concepts lurking behind others of the
<br>
Principles as well.  There is an implicit assumption that people
<br>
should have the right and power to expand beyond their limitations,
<br>
to change themselves, to exploit new technologies and new capabilities.
<br>
Extropianism is (or was) a doctrine of potentially unlimited expansion.
<br>
This implies a degree of personal autonomy and self-direction which is
<br>
libertarian by its very nature.
<br>
<p>In the context of transhumanism, what is the difference between
<br>
libertarianism and its main alternative, modern liberal Western
<br>
democratic government?  How would a libertarian and a modern social
<br>
liberal disagree about the proper way to approach transhumanism?
<br>
In my opinion the disagreement must relate to individual autonomy and
<br>
the right of government to regulate the individual.  The libertarian
<br>
believes that the individual has the right to do as he wishes so long as
<br>
he doesn't harm others.  To the extent that the social democrat disagrees,
<br>
he must believe that the individual does not have such rights.  He must
<br>
believe that government has the right to decide what forms of transhuman
<br>
expression are to be allowed.
<br>
<p>When we look at non-libertarian transhumanism and contrast it with
<br>
traditional Extropianism, this must be where the difference lies.
<br>
Non-libertarian transhumanism, as exemplifed by the WTA for example,
<br>
must not believe that individuals have the right to do what they will
<br>
(subject to the limitations of not harming others), otherwise they
<br>
would be libertarians.  Hence they must believe that society should
<br>
have the right to limit what individuals will do, even in the context
<br>
of transhuman enhancements which do no harm to anyone else.
<br>
<p>The Transhumanist Declaration of the WTA explicitly declares,
<br>
&quot;Transhumanism does not support any particular party, politician or
<br>
political platform.&quot;  It attempts to be politically agnostic and not to
<br>
favor libertarian politics.  However when we come to point 4 of the
<br>
Declaration, an inconsistent element arises:
<br>
<p>&quot;Transhumanists advocate the moral right for those who wish to use
<br>
technology to extend their mental and physical capabilities and to improve
<br>
their control over their own lives.  We seek personal growth beyond our
<br>
current biological limitations.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here the Declaration moves beyond simply accepting whatever society
<br>
decides.  It advocates a &quot;moral right&quot; for people to engage in self
<br>
improvement and to grow beyond their biological limitations.
<br>
<p>What is a moral right in this context?  It means that it would be immoral
<br>
for others to interfere with the exercise of this right.  In particular,
<br>
it means that it would be immoral for society to interfere with an
<br>
individual who chose to use technology to peacefully engage in self
<br>
improvement.
<br>
<p>But this is exactly the libertarian position on the question of transhuman
<br>
self-improvement!  And it is in complete contradiction to the social
<br>
democratic position, which is that society and government have the moral
<br>
right to regulate even individual activities which do not harm others.
<br>
Hence it seems that on the crucial question of self-improvement, which
<br>
is indeed the only relevant question with regard to trans-humanism,
<br>
the WTA while paying lip service to being politically agnostic, in fact
<br>
adopts the Extropian position, which is the libertarian one: that people
<br>
are and should be the masters of their own fate.
<br>
<p>The WTA's Transhumanist Declaration therefore seems to be somewhat
<br>
contradictory on this crucial question.  On the one hand it presents
<br>
itself as an alternative to Extropianism which is politically agnostic
<br>
or even tending to the social democratic side of the poltiical spectrum.
<br>
But on the other hand it adopts the Extropian, libertarian position that
<br>
people have a moral right to engage in self transformation.  Is it just
<br>
a matter of trying to sneak in libertarianism through the back door,
<br>
so as not to antagonize people?  Is there a hope that supporters of the
<br>
WTA will not realize that they are being asked to accept a fundamentally
<br>
libertarian position, because of their prejudice against what they see
<br>
as a right-wing (or as Hughes has it, even neo-Nazi) philosophy?
<br>
<p>I'd like to hear more about how the WTA expresses its position on
<br>
individual versus government rights, especially with regard to transhuman
<br>
technology.
<br>
