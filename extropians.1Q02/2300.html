And the left says &quot;why wait for a Singularity?  We can care for people

_now_.&quot;
<br>
<p>Compared to most of agricultural history the Singularity has already
<br>
happened.  Used to be most people worked their butts off just to grow
<br>
food, and a small elite skimmed the surplus.  Now 3% or less of the US
<br>
population works directly producing food (although more may be building
<br>
tractors, obtaining fuel, driving trucks around) and a lot of the
<br>
population is doing weird abstract 'work' subsistence farmers wouldn't
<br>
think of.  The poor are obese instead of starving, clothing is cheap,
<br>
housing is cheap, life expectancies are at record highs...
<br>
<p>You want a Singularity?  Wotcha waiting for?  Sure, there's more work to
<br>
be done.  But if you want to reduce pain and fight the unfairness of the
<br>
universe, there's plenty of slack to start now.
<br>
<p>(Concrete example: we're about to spend $7 billion on missile defense.
<br>
That could buy lots of vaccines for Africa, or DDT-treated mosquito
<br>
netting to fight malaria, or clean water...)
