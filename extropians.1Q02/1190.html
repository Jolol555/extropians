</em><br>
<p>It's a common misconception that the Israeli Army is gender neutral or 
<br>
fully integrated.  During the early years of nationhood it was true that 
<br>
women fought alongside men, mostly due to a shortage of manpower and the 
<br>
unorthodox revolutionary nature of the conflict at the time.  Once Israel 
<br>
established itself their more formalized armed forces removed women from 
<br>
all frontline combat roles, similar to what we have in America today.
<br>
<p>I am curious as to any other armies of the world that are fully integrated 
<br>
along the lines of Starship Troopers.  As a former military officer I'm 
<br>
not aware of any.  It &quot;seems to work out MUCH better...&quot;?  If there are 
<br>
any and they do work MUCH better, I'd love to know about it.  I'd also 
<br>
like to know their demonstrated combat effectiveness or reputation for 
<br>
success on the battlefield.  Because the fundamental issue here is not 
<br>
whether women can fight.  They certainly can and do.  The issue is how 
<br>
well a fully integrated infantry or combat-arms unit would fight, as a 
<br>
unit, over a period of time.  Sexual tension injected into an otherwise 
<br>
highly emotional situation under dire and strenuous circumstances that put 
<br>
young men and young women together in very close and sometimes intimate 
<br>
relationships would seem to me to have a significant impact on combat 
<br>
effectiveness. No? As far as I'm aware it's the main reason that it hasn't 
<br>
been adopted in the US, political rhetoric aside.  It's more than cultural 
<br>
indoctrination, and it's not something that will simply go away as society 
<br>
or people get used to it.  Combat effectiveness is hard enough to attain 
<br>
and maintain without the turmoil of the sexual factor on the frontlines.  
<br>
And it will be a long time before we condition men and women to simply 
<br>
ignore or suppress at will our evolutionary sexual impulses enough to 
<br>
where they don't negatively impact unit fighting capability, transhumanism 
<br>
notwithstanding.  IMO.
