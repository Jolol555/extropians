From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20We're%20stuck%20with%20each%20other">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry.  MNT is Molecular Nanotechnology.  When I speak of &quot;robust&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MNT, I'm usually refering to the kind that is capable of programmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replication (one can avoid the self-replication nightmares) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-repair (internal recycling) as biological systems currently do.
</em><br>
<p>Unlike other people, I don't expect that kind of technology for a few
<br>
centuries.  Right now, the state of the art is to get a human sized robot to
<br>
walk on two legs without falling over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Most people would also want an internet conneciton, and that would cost
</em><br>
money.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't have to.  There are already situations in which groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are putting together everything from line-of-sight high bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laser communications to distributed 3G wireless.
</em><br>
<p>Great technology, but I don't see why you think it will be free.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember is the *designs* that cost the money, not the materials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the MNT era.
</em><br>
<p>Like I said, I don't expect that era within our life times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Open source, people who don't have to &quot;work&quot; for a living who can devote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their full time to the project, philanthropists who are older for whom
</em><br>
biomedical
<br>
<em>&gt; technology may not be advancing may not be advancing fast enough,
</em><br>
accumulating
<br>
<em>&gt; wealth and cheaper technology, faster computers, etc.  By the time we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out how to do uploading, I don't expect there to be significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material barriers to making it available to anyone who wants it.
</em><br>
<p>I see your points on the advance of technology.  I don't agree that it will
<br>
be provided free for everyone.  Look at Microsoft!  When someone discovers
<br>
this great technology, they will patent it, stop anyone else from getting
<br>
it, and LICENSE it to the general public for a large fee.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When PCs become as cheap as cell phones, I think you will see many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more people using them.
</em><br>
<p>When PC's are as cheap as cell phones, they will still be just as
<br>
unafordable to most of the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everyone will be able to afford 3 DNC because the doubling time for MNT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an hour (and thats conservative).  Society as a whole gets richer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on the technology-base-growth-rate / population-growth-rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say technology sophistication is growing at a rate of 10%/yr (or becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% cheaper per year) while population is growing at 5%/yr.  Obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society as a whole is getting richer.  In fact as Kurzweil and others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; document, the growth rates for many technologies is *much* faster than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10%/yr.  And that is still based on non-self-replicating systems or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid-assembly-line matter compilers.
</em><br>
<p>The same argument was made for &quot;money&quot;.  People predicted that after the
<br>
world got some billionaires money would be superfluous and they would
<br>
philanthropically pay to end world hunger.  This hasn't happened.
<br>
<p>No matter how fast the &quot;doubling time&quot;, only the people rich enough to own
<br>
the first nanobots would control the newer nanobots.  All the &quot;doubling
<br>
time&quot; does is to create more nanobots for those who already have them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is the thing to think long and hard about.  We know nanotechnology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists.  Every single person reading this has ~40 trillion nanoscale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;biobots&quot; with &quot;foreign&quot; genomes operating on or within their body.
</em><br>
<p>I don't equate nanobots with viruses.  What people usually mean by nanobots
<br>
(like your replicating machines building space ships) is simply beyond the
<br>
capabilities of viruses.  To base nanobot metrics on viruses is unrealistic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The doubling time for many of those biobots is ~20 minutes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That means that *if* you can supply them with sufficient matter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy, a single biobot can grow to the mass of the Earth in ~2 days.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  I know my body mass isn't doubling every 20 minutes.  What are you
<br>
refering to when you say &quot;biobots&quot; and &quot;doubling time&quot; already existing in
<br>
our bodies?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The key thing to understand is that materials for biobots, C/H/O/N
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are free for the taking from the atmosphere (a little P/S &amp; trace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metals may be required but the costs are minimal).  The other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential element is energy.  That is free too if one has access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sufficient sunlight.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds great.  The big point you are missing is where are YOU going to
<br>
get your first biobot?  The microscopic, infinitely programmable,
<br>
self-maintaining nanites you are talking about may not even be possible!
<br>
Definitely not free.
<br>
<p>Everything you say makes sense, but only after someone already owns one of
<br>
these miraculous biobots.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; It costs millions to put something into Earth orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not if you have the designs.  Someone commented at Extro4 I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Eric Drexler had once designed a rocket-suit that consumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diamond &amp; oxygen as a fuel and you ended up in orbit in a skin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tight diamondoid space suit.
</em><br>
<p>LOL!  You're doing it again!  You are protesting that these things are
<br>
&quot;free&quot; and then talk about burning diamonds for fuel and having a whole suit
<br>
made of diamonds!  I don't even think Bill Gates can afford this &quot;free&quot;
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'd like to know where you get this &quot;free&quot; energy.  I could use it now,
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before I upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think land in Texas can be had for $200-$300/acre -- though you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to buy it in large pieces.  Its very underutilized since a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of Texas is unprofitable from an agricultural perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best they can do with it is use it for grazing cattle.
</em><br>
<p>And how does this give me free energy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I could afford to put myself off of the earth, then yes, I wouldn't
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to worry about what earth laws say.  Unfortunately, I am not that
</em><br>
wealthy
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (yet).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah but you will be -- *if* you can convince a bunch of your friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live on a diet of yogurt produced in a solar pond on the back 40
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (probably the earliest application of food production using biobots)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you slave away day and night at producing the open source designs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the nanomachines that can produce your rocket-suit.  Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can convince Doug or Spike to come help you work on it.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  If I can design your miraculous nanomachines, I would be rich.
<br>
Of course, once I had such wondrous machines, I would be god-like and not
<br>
care about money.  (Although I still would be out of luck when I publish my
<br>
&quot;open source&quot; and no-one GIVES me one of the nanobots.)
