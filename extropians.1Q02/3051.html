<em>&gt;I have felt for some time that cryonics was a lead weight dragging down
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceptance of Drexlerian nanotech.  My theory is that people have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overwhelmingly negative emotional reaction to cryonics, in part because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it implies that the death of their loved ones was preventable, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carries over to any technology which would seem to make cryonics credible.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't get this impression at all. To the limited extent that investors
<br>
are noticing Drexlerian nanotech, they don't seem to connect it with
<br>
cryonics beyond noticing that both require long-term forecasts to determine
<br>
their value. Investors have been pretty consistent about distinguishing
<br>
between long-term research projects and projects that can become commercial
<br>
products within a few years. The best explanation I can come up with for
<br>
their motives is a desire not to repeat the kind of mistakes they made
<br>
at the height of the internet bubble - betting on half-baked forecasts
<br>
of what companies would be earning five to ten years into the future.
<br>
(People who made those kinds of bets on the internet around 1995 are doing
<br>
quite well, and I haven't seen any speculation in nanotech stocks that
<br>
rivals the Netscape IPO yet. But most investors remember the peak better
<br>
than they remember 1995, probably because most of them didn't know about
<br>
the internet in 1995 and have some reason to think they aren't wise enough
<br>
to get in at the very start of a big trend).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But maybe that was premature.  We are seeing a backlash, a rearguard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fighting action against the original vision of nanotech.  Opponents are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to build a firewall against Drexlerian mechanosynthesis, drawing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinction between their prosaic nanotech and Drexler's far-out visions.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Fighting action&quot; is an exaggeration. Except for a couple of Nobel prize
<br>
winners whose careers would seem less important if Drexler's vision was
<br>
realized soon, the main reaction is more like &quot;we can't see that far into
<br>
the future&quot;. Zyvex apparently hasn't had any trouble getting funding for its
<br>
MEMS research (from a combination of government and industry sources) while
<br>
saying they're following Drexler's vision (although they seem to be putting
<br>
increasing emphasis on non-Drexlerian justifications for their research).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think Foresight needs to go back to its roots and shore up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foundations.  It's not enough to have &quot;nanotechnology&quot; initiatives showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up everywhere.  Few of those efforts are making significant progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt;towards Drexler's machine-based models.  Foresight needs to remind
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I would certainly like Foresight to criticise nanohype in a more clear
<br>
and public manner than it has been doing. But doing so effectively would
<br>
drive away some of their senior associates (such as Josh Wolfe) and create
<br>
problems with their running of technical conferences that are dominated by
<br>
researchers who aren't interested in Drexlerian nanotech. I.e. they appear
<br>
to have a nontrivial financial incentive to stick to their current course.
<br>
&nbsp;What can we do about that? Offer to increase our donations to Foresight
<br>
if they piss off the short-sighted nanotechnologists? I doubt we're willing
<br>
to offer enough money for that. Threaten to switch a competing organization?
<br>
ExI is sort of a competitor that farsighted senior associates can think of
<br>
as an alternative to Foresight, but I don't know how to make it into a
<br>
succesful enough organization that I could dismiss Foresight as unimportant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;people that there is more to nanotech than making ultra-fine powders
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for smoother paint.  We have to keep our eye on the prize, a technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which can utterly revolutionize every aspect of the world.  If research
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not moving us towards that goal, it should not receive funding under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nanotech grants, even if it happens to involve little tiny pieces.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Foresight hasn't exactly been praising the government for spending
<br>
it's research money wisely, although it tends to direct what few comments
<br>
it makes towards hardcore senior associates rather than towards the public.
