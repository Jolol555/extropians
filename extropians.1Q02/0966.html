<p>I'm no expert on the subject, but I can attest to the apparent reality of 
<br>
schizophrenic delusions.  One of my grandmothers was paranoid 
<br>
schizophrenic, and until the time she died last year, she would call as 
<br>
many as a dozen times a week (from New Zealand, no less) to warn my father 
<br>
of things such as the planeload of criminal psychiatrists en route to our 
<br>
home, or the doctors doing black witchcraft on my mother's gall 
<br>
bladder.  She heard about all this &quot;over the intercom&quot; (of which, of 
<br>
course, she never had).  When I would answer the phone, she would ask &quot;Open 
<br>
the door and let Daddy in, dear...he's outside being whipped.&quot;  Obviously, 
<br>
to us they were just delusions (annoying ones when we had to face them via 
<br>
3 a.m. phone calls) but to her they were as real as anything 
<br>
else.  Unfortunately, she never had the realization that they weren't 
<br>
&quot;real&quot; to other people.
<br>
<p>During the late fifties and early sixties (roughly contemporaneous with 
<br>
Nash) she was committed to a mental hospital where she received shock 
<br>
treatments, which ultimately didn't do her any good, though New Zealand's 
<br>
medical system at that time was a bit more archaic than that of other parts 
<br>
of the world.
<br>
<p>What I have always found fascinating is how one's perspective of reality 
<br>
can be so obviously skewered, yet the vast majority of the mind still works 
<br>
as it should.  They know left from right, know sunshine from clouds, can do 
<br>
complex mathematical equations or create great works of art.  Yet they 
<br>
don't see the same thing we see.  It's a bit disconcerting that reality 
<br>
itself doesn't play as big a part in a person's mind as we often 
<br>
think.  Functionality can be largely unmarred (in the case of my 
<br>
grandmother as well as the movie depiction of Nash, at least) while they 
<br>
see things that aren't there.
