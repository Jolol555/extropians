<p><p><p>Point-'n'-Shoot Sound Makes Waves
<br>
By John Gartner
<br>
<p>2:00 a.m. Feb. 21, 2002 PST
<br>
<p>Those voices in your head may be real.
<br>
<p>Researchers have developed technology that can project a beam of sound so
<br>
narrow that only one person can hear it. &quot;Directed&quot; audio sounds like it's
<br>
coming from right in front of you even when transmitted from a few hundred
<br>
meters away.
<br>
<p>Inventors of the new &quot;ventriloquist&quot; technology say it could provide an
<br>
added dimension to entertainment. The military, however, is investigating
<br>
using it to confuse opponents or even inflict pain.
<br>
<p><p><p>The Audio Spotlight is one of two competing audio transmission systems that
<br>
emit a one-foot square column of sound that can only be heard by people in
<br>
its direct path. Joseph Pompei, a PhD student at the MIT Media Lab, decided
<br>
to develop it while working at audio company Bose, which he joined at 16 as
<br>
its youngest-ever engineer.
<br>
<p>Pompei, who used to play jazz trumpet in nightclubs in Chicago, became
<br>
interested in how sound systems reproduce and distribute music. He thought
<br>
it would be cool to &quot;choreograph sound just like you would dancers on
<br>
stage.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pompei imagined that instead of loudspeakers blaring the same cacophony of
<br>
instruments to all parts of the room, it would be more interesting to
<br>
selectively spotlight the soloist to the left side of the audience, while
<br>
featuring the percussion up front, and then switching them around.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sound in real life is occurring all around you. Regular speakers only go so
<br>
far in reproducing an accurate environment,&quot; Pompei said.
<br>
<p>Pompei developed the first demonstration systems of the technology for
<br>
installations at Sega's Joyopolis theme park in Tokyo and the Boston Museum
<br>
of Science, and he's planning to start selling it commercially soon. He said
<br>
museums like the system because visitors who stand in front of an exhibit
<br>
can hear the appropriate audio track without being distracted by sound from
<br>
other displays.
<br>
<p>The Audio Spotlight transmitters range from several inches in diameter to
<br>
about 20 inches and generate a column of sound between one to three degrees
<br>
wider than the transmitter.
<br>
<p>The technology could also be used to prevent fights over the car's radio
<br>
tuner, Pompei said. He put several Audio Spotlights in a concept truck from
<br>
Chrysler, which enabled passengers to hear their own radio stations -- the
<br>
kids in the back seat enjoyed heavy metal while the parents relaxed to
<br>
elevator music. &quot;It could make for much happier trips,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>The Audio Spotlight converts ordinary audio into high-frequency ultrasonic
<br>
signals that are outside the range of normal hearing. As these sound waves
<br>
push out from the source, they interact with air pressure to create audible
<br>
sounds.
<br>
<p>Pompei said the &quot;non-linear&quot; effect of air pressure modifies sound waves in
<br>
a consistent fashion. He wrote algorithms that &quot;reverse-engineered&quot; the
<br>
desired sound waves to determine the appropriate ultrasonic source signals.
<br>
<p>According to University of Texas professor David Blackstock, high-frequency
<br>
signals are easier to focus, and control like a flashlight, than sounds that
<br>
are within the human range of hearing, which disperse in all directions.
<br>
Blackstock said ultrasonic signals &quot;decay more slowly than lower-frequency
<br>
waves&quot; so they are easier to send farther.
<br>
<p>The Audio Spotlight emits sounds in the 60-kilohertz range, which, according
<br>
to Blackstock, is well above the 20-KHz limit of human hearing.
<br>
<p>Blackstock said the first experiments to use ultrasonic sounds were
<br>
conducted underwater in the 1960s, and Japanese researchers made advances in
<br>
the 1980s but were unable to create a commercial application for the
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>Pompei said Audio Spotlights are currently being installed in Australia for
<br>
the upcoming Fringe Festival. Pompei started Holosonic Research Labs to sell
<br>
Audio Spotlights to corporations such as Kraft and Kodak, which are in the
<br>
process of integrating them into information kiosks and retail displays.
<br>
<p>An alternative to Pompei's invention, which also may be commercially
<br>
available soon, is American Technology's Hypersonic Sound System. The HSS
<br>
system similarly converts audio into ultrasonic sound waves, and Blackstock
<br>
was impressed by a demonstration.
<br>
<p>Blackstock said he heard a clear signal at about 100 meters, but then heard
<br>
nothing by moving two steps out of the audio's path. &quot;It's remarkable, a
<br>
spectacular effect.&quot;
<br>
<p>American Technology president Terry Conrad said the company is going into
<br>
its first mass production of chips that convert the audible sounds into
<br>
ultrasonic waves in February.
<br>
<p>American Technology recently signed an agreement with the U.S. Army to
<br>
develop the technology for a decidedly non-commercial use: psychological
<br>
warfare.
<br>
<p>According to American Technology CTO Jim Croft, the technology could be used
<br>
to confuse opponents by making them think there was someone nearby. Small
<br>
transmitters could be kept out of sight, and ghost sounds could be bounced
<br>
off &quot;rocks or any reflective surface&quot; to fool people into believing they
<br>
were not alone.
<br>
<p>American Technology is also working on a stronger version of the technology
<br>
called Directed Stick Radiator, Croft said. This &quot;acoustic assault rifle&quot; is
<br>
shaped like a gun, but instead of bullets, it dispenses high-decibel sounds
<br>
that would cause discomfort or even pain.
<br>
<p>Croft said the company is developing prototypes of the debilitating weapon
<br>
that could be mounted on a jeep and used for crowd control. &quot;It could be a
<br>
very effective first-level deterrent,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Pompei, conversely, is happy to make music, not war, with his system. He
<br>
said U2's Bono is a fan of the Audio Spotlight and recently flew him to Los
<br>
Angeles to measure the acoustics during a Staples Center performance.
<br>
<p>He would prefer that others adopt his invention to returning to the stage
<br>
himself. &quot;I make a much better scientist than musician.&quot;
