</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;As should be clear, I was not making a claim, but advancing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought experiment.  Only the most ideologically arrogant would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe that enhancing the intelligence of their children would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guaranteed to make them follow the politics of their parents.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post was an invitation to consider how it would feel if this did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not hold.  Someone with a strong political ideology would then be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put in something of the same position as the deaf parents today. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They might even begin to feel some empathy for the deaf parents'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation, rather than the attitudes of contempt and scorn which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mike and others adopted.
</em><br>
<p>What &quot;others&quot;?
<br>
<p>I took your invitation at face value, and pointed out that my
<br>
(theoretical) children were certainly entitled to their own
<br>
beliefs/politics, and it was essentially none of my business. 
<br>
<p>But you also were making a claim, which you even tried to defend,
<br>
the notion that the smarter you are the more likely you are to
<br>
believe in socialism.
<br>
<p>Like anyone of reasonable intelligence I went through a socialism
<br>
phase, realized the flaws and promptly dropped it.
<br>
<p>The only real Socialist/Communists in the world are at the
<br>
University of Chicago.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Those who are 100% certain that they are correct about everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involving politics and human relations need not pursue the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Such closed minds are largely immune to education and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enlightenment, in any case.
</em><br>
<p><p>Little pompous here don't you think?
