<p>Not &quot;taboo&quot;, but requiring plausible explanations and if it
<br>
involves &quot;extraordinary&quot; claims, it requires &quot;extraordinary&quot; proof.
<br>
<p>I'd argue that 90% or more of the people on the list cannot explain
<br>
how the 5-40 million transistor microprocessor in their computer
<br>
actually works.  To someone of my grandparents' generation it 
<br>
certainly *seems* like magic even though it follows the principles
<br>
of physics as we now understand them.  
<br>
<p>Even worse nobody in the world is able to explain the functioning
<br>
of a human body or the human mind.  Certainly &quot;magic&quot; from where
<br>
we now stand, though we &quot;suspect&quot; they follow principles of physics.
<br>
<p>Now, if I happen to suggest that the alignment of the planets
<br>
results in fluctuations in the quantum gravity field that
<br>
dictates how chromosomes recombine which results in the
<br>
variations in personalities that we happen to associate
<br>
with star signs, due to my &quot;reputation&quot; for not invoking
<br>
magic physics, at least some people might think I was making
<br>
a serious claim.  But people are going to want to see the data. 
<br>
<p>I was recently asked my opinion about this site:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.stardrivedevice.com/">http://www.stardrivedevice.com/</a>
<br>
<p>All I could say was that at first glance they seemed to be
<br>
proposing technologies that would violate a number of accepted
<br>
laws of physics.
<br>
<p>So -- that may be the &quot;razor&quot; when it comes to &quot;Magick&quot; -- if
<br>
you can propose a magick that appears magical but does not
<br>
violate laws of physics then it is reasonable to bring it
<br>
to the table.  If you propose magick that appears to violate
<br>
laws of physics then the burden of proof is on your shoulders
<br>
to explain where the laws of physics need to be extended or
<br>
how such ideas do not violate the laws.
<br>
<p>I would sooner believe that one could change the neural connections
<br>
in your mind to *really* believe that magick had happened than
<br>
you could change the physical laws of the universe.  It comes
<br>
down to a simple question of which is more malleable.
<br>
