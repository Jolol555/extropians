<p>WHich is all rather BS. I'll buy that Starfleet operates
<br>
communistically, much as many military organizations do today to a
<br>
limited extent. In todays US military, for instance, a soldier does not
<br>
really have any need for the pay he receives, unless he starts a family.
<br>
As a single individual, one could do an entire four years doing nothing
<br>
but living in on base barracks, eating base cafeteria food, and using
<br>
base facilities (gym, library, golf course, movie theater, NCO or
<br>
Officers club, PX, etc) consuming little of one's monthly pay, if at
<br>
all. 
<br>
<p>US Navy ships are even more so.
<br>
<p>A Captain living in the world of Starfleet would have little need of
<br>
money if all of his/her needs were met by the starfleet replicator
<br>
technology. However, we rarely see in Star Trek anyone who isn't in
<br>
Starfleet who ISN'T engaged in private enterprise.
<br>
<p>Most of all, what is the point of naming the flagship of the fleet
<br>
&quot;Enterprise&quot; if it is a communist society?
<br>
<p>There are many incidents in Star Trek history of businessmen operating
<br>
openly, even if some are depicted in a rather typically
<br>
biased-Roddenberry fashion (Harry Mudd, of &quot;Troubles with Tribbles&quot; and
<br>
other episodes of ST:TOS featuring him, including the one with the
<br>
beauty pills and dilithium miners, and the one where Harry meets his
<br>
apparent end at the hands of an android that appears as his ex wife....)
<br>
<p>In ST:TSFS, McCoy tries to arrange for passage to the Mutara sector with
<br>
a private shipowner in a private bar.
<br>
<p>In ST:TNG, Capt. Picard's brother owns his own vinyard in France, which
<br>
he labored to keep &quot;in the family&quot; while Picard went off to the stars.
<br>
Furthermore, the Ferengi ARE a part of the Federation, even if they are
<br>
looked down on by snooty starfleet types.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, in ST:DSN, there are numerous incidents of private
<br>
businesspeople, including the Ferengi Quark, who owns his own bar/casino
<br>
on the space station, as well as the Cardassian tailor, who owns his own
<br>
shop.
