<p>Give us a break, John.  Some of us don't respond to wildly irrational stuff because
<br>
we do not want to be baited, or to clog up the list with yet more useless jabber.
<br>
Conspiracy theory speculation, by its very nature, spawns memetic replication and
<br>
mutation nearly without bound.  Yes, I find Dossy's post completely foolish.  IMHO,
<br>
most who post such things have no experience or knowledge of how big organizations
<br>
work.  &quot;The government&quot; is a phrase thrown around as if it were one thing, with one
<br>
controlling will, able to contrive outcomes in the world and make them happen.  In
<br>
fact, the coordination of agencies needed to get anything big accomplished, in the
<br>
US, is always at the edge of the capabilities of the people trying to manage it;
<br>
and that is in the full light of day.
<br>
<p>Benjamin Franklin understood covert operations very well, and said: &quot;Three may keep
<br>
a secret, if two of them are dead.&quot;  The bigger the operation, the sooner it will
<br>
no longer be secret.  Planners know this, and must provide for the time when their
<br>
actions become public knowledge.  Only a conspiracy of idiots would do otherwise.
<br>
<p>What is ludicrous on the US side is even worse on the other.  Dossy would have us
<br>
believe that a terrorist group accepted the following deal:  &quot;We will help you hit
<br>
a few of our buildings, and then we get to come over with our full military and
<br>
annihilate you and all your friends.&quot;
<br>
<p>Passing over conspiracy theory posts is not apathy.  I ask that folks ignore this
<br>
thread, and let it die.
<br>
