<em>&gt;This is &quot;National Enron Media Week.&quot; Now that Ex-CEO Kenneth Law has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refused to testify to a Senate committee, we may be facing &quot;National
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Enron Media Year.&quot; It's &quot;All Enron, all the time.&quot;
</em><br>
........
<br>
<em>&gt;The media are on Enron like a dog on a bone. 
</em><br>
......
<br>
<em>&gt;This media feeding frenzy is basically reports on an empty barn from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which the thoroughbred horses have all escaped. The horses that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left behind - nags, mostly - are not topics for public discussion. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have yet to see even one report on Enron's future prospects, yet 15,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Enron's 20,000 employees are still at work. 
</em><br>
<p>True, true.  The mass media is such a joke. I came *this* close to
<br>
buying a huge wad of Enron stock back when the mass media anti-hype
<br>
began a couple months ago (Enron went to .26/share: I woulda made ~5X
<br>
on that--it went to 1.21/share in a week. It will probably still go up
<br>
from what it is now).  Whatever way the mass media arrow points, go
<br>
the OTHER way...that is always the best course :-)
<br>
<p>BTW, I work in downtown Houston and ride by Enron every day.  And
<br>
there is at least one Exi list member who works at Enron.
<br>
<p>Another sick joke: the Enron employee relief fund: 1000's and 1000's
<br>
of dollars for relief for the poor Enron employees--what a joke: the
<br>
median income of Enron employees is probably at least 45K...boo hooo!
<br>
<p>Meanwhile the working poor typically are completely ignored by the
<br>
mass media--the poor darlings don't patronize the advertisers that
<br>
support the media, dontcha know....and as for the inner city welfare
<br>
poor, well, the mass media certainly wouldn't ignore them--otherwise
<br>
they would destroy the property of the business class, the true bosses
<br>
of the media, who buy the ads.

</em><br>
<p>BTW, lewrockwell is a great site. It is good to see people that
<br>
actually think original thoughts, as opposed to being an empty vessel
<br>
for memes backed by money.
