<p><p>It looks to me like instead of patching the current hodge-podge 
<br>
system with its friction (rake-offs) and ills, it would make 
<br>
more sense to simply say that everyone who is willing and able 
<br>
to go to college and can make the grade gets supported in doing 
<br>
so to a certain reasonable minimal level if they do not have 
<br>
other means of support or to supplement inadequate levels of 
<br>
support.  This could be done as a fundamental given with very 
<br>
minimum red tape and friction.  It could also be done as a 
<br>
non-profit rather than a tax-driven government program but the 
<br>
coverage would be likely to be less complete.  I will gladly 
<br>
donate generously to such a program myself once I am no longer 
<br>
supporting my own 2 dependents.
