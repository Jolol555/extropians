Here are some of my thoughts on Nietzsche and transhumanism.

<p>I think, if we can get out of the quoting orgy, that we need to think
<br>
about Nietzsche's role in transhumanist thinking. That he has written a
<br>
lot of very fun, succinct or transhumanesque quotes doesn't mean he is a
<br>
good philosopher to build upon; we could just as well quote the fun,
<br>
succinct or transhumanesque quotes in the Bible too as support or
<br>
decorations for our views.
<br>
<p>Of course, part of the problem is that Nietzsche is inconsistent and
<br>
changed views a number of times; I'm not enough of an expert to really
<br>
tell if it makes more sense of talking about an early or late Nietzsche,
<br>
or if a finer temporal or memetic division is needed. But lets look at
<br>
the ideas of Nietzsche that seems to resonate with transhumanism:
<br>
<p>* The infinite perspectives
<br>
* A non-theist worldview, where ethics has to be constructed anew
<br>
* The overman
<br>
* The will to power
<br>
<p>The infinite perspectives in Nietzsche are really a kind of relativism,
<br>
and has become tremendously popular in much of modern philosophy. But
<br>
does it make sense to build a transhumanism on relativism, and if it
<br>
does, how much? Clearly, total relativism would make any claims that
<br>
nanotechnology is better than wishful thinking at providing food and
<br>
longevity irrelevant. A strong relativism of values would also make
<br>
transhumanism something we do because we want to, neither more or less
<br>
important than any other human activity like working, playing golf or
<br>
collecting stamps. A more refined relativism makes more sense,
<br>
acknowledging the subjectivity of our different perspectives but
<br>
recognizing that there exists a real world out there and that our
<br>
actions affect it and hence ourselves. I think there is a lot of
<br>
potential in a more mature relativism, but then one should try to look
<br>
beyond the guy who started the whole thing. 
<br>
<p>Nietzsche is often called a nihilist, but I get the impression he was
<br>
really after a way of bootstrapping an ethics out of his minimalist
<br>
assumptions. A bit like the philosophy mentioned in Ken MacLeod's _The
<br>
Cassini Division_, perhaps. If you can build something certain out of
<br>
uncertainty, then it is likely extremely strong - as Descartes believed
<br>
about his own system.  This idea of bootstrapping an ethics is very
<br>
appealing to us transhumanists, since we are essentially problematizing
<br>
the entire human condition and do not seek recourse to some deity. The
<br>
problem is partly of course that when you cast aside everything old, you
<br>
tend to cast aside everything learned too - even if there are obvious
<br>
problems with much of the ethics in the past, that doesn't mean it is
<br>
valueless and that we should not use the solid pieces when we construct
<br>
our own. 
<br>
<p>The other part, and perhaps more vexing, is that trying to build without
<br>
any assumptions is extremely hard, and quite easy goes wrong. But it is
<br>
also appealing, especially if you don't want to spend a few years
<br>
reading what every bearded greek or german philosopher mumbled about
<br>
rights, human nature or categorical imperatives - the Nietzschean
<br>
approach seem to promise that anybody with a sufficiently large ambition
<br>
(and who haven't, after reading a few quotes from Also Sprach
<br>
Zarathustra?) can do it. The result is usually a lot of reinventing the
<br>
wheel. 
<br>
<p>The overman is of course the most misused idea of Nietzsche; in a way it
<br>
his own fault, because he coined a name for a concept, and made the name
<br>
so general that anybody can use it to denote their own concept of
<br>
something &quot;over&quot; man. To us transhumanists it is of course the
<br>
transhuman or posthuman (and by extension ourselves; a lot of the appeal
<br>
of transhumanism is likely the self-congratulatory feeling we get when
<br>
we imagine gradiose posthumans as ourselves), to a fascist it would be
<br>
comebody embodying the national spirit. Nietzsche's overman seems to be
<br>
mostly philosophical: somebody who has overcome all illusions about the
<br>
world, ethics, himself and his own illusions, and now lives a life
<br>
according to his will to power. I guess the Nietzschean overman would be
<br>
a loud Zen master, not so much interested in teaching or contemplation
<br>
as revelling in his promethean hyperpraxy. 
<br>
<p>The problem when borrowing the overman term is of course guilt by
<br>
association - even using the word transhuman carries a bit of a stigma.
<br>
But there is also the problem that when transhumanists discuss the
<br>
various over/hyper/post/ex-humans we tend to ignore the human and look
<br>
more at the prefix. It is easy to imagine advanced posthumans, it is far
<br>
harder to imagine a development path from current humans (us!) that
<br>
would lead to them. Some might argue that we have a kind of path
<br>
planned (usually the canonical linear sequence life extension - life
<br>
enhancement - bionics - nanotech - uploading - grandiose posthumanity),
<br>
but that is even at best (and usually it is just handwaving) a
<br>
technological progression with no concern for how to get a real human
<br>
mind and culture to develop into something fitting to be the software of
<br>
these posthumans. I think we all agree we do not want neurotic jupiter
<br>
brains or immortals with addiction problems and a hangup on parenting.
<br>
The problem is that when dealing with these issues we again have to deal
<br>
with the complex and messy side of human existence which is so much
<br>
harder to deal with (and not possible to &quot;solve&quot;; at best we can
<br>
hope to &quot;resolve&quot; some stuff) than the technology issues - and when the
<br>
debate comes up here on extropians, the views rarely seem to move
<br>
outside traditional ideological and cultural lines. We may be good at
<br>
imagining how to manage replicating nanobots, but where is the similarly
<br>
incisive ideas for how we can restructure our habits for a quickly
<br>
changing world?
<br>
<p>In the end we want to be both the very alive and active overman, and
<br>
physically immortal. That goes beyond Nietzsche's original idea. 
<br>
<p>As for the will to power, I think it is another interesting concept that
<br>
whose label is easily affixed to other things. Here I think
<br>
transhumanism is actually closer to Nietzsche than most other
<br>
interpretations. In Nietzsche it seems to be very much a joi de vivre,
<br>
the innate striving of everything alive to remain alive and grow more -
<br>
very much a transhuman sentiment. The misinterpretation (?) of it as a
<br>
seeking of coercive power and the implied struggle everybody against
<br>
everybody else is far less transhumanist. It seems to mirror the common
<br>
complaint against transhumanists that we seek to become powerful, and
<br>
this will come at the expense of the less powerful - very much a zero
<br>
sum way of thinking (but there are unfortunately some transhumanists
<br>
with the same naive view). What transhumanism really should be about is
<br>
power over ourselves and our lives - and if we regard our enjoyment of
<br>
life as valuable, then we ought to regard other's enjoyment of it as
<br>
valuable too. 
<br>
<p>Nietzsche's evolutionary perspective seems resonant with many ideas in
<br>
transhumanism that also see evolution as a powerful metaphor or even
<br>
underlying regularity. But one has to remain aware that there is a
<br>
tremendous difference between biological evolution and human activities
<br>
- we let our ideas die in our stead, we help our sick relatives survive
<br>
and economic and cultural change (and autoevolution) are far more
<br>
Lamarkian than Darwinian. There is a fundamental irreversibility in
<br>
evolution as information from the environment flows into the genome,
<br>
which seems to run into Nietzsche's affirmation of the present and
<br>
cyclic rather than the future and expanding. 
<br>
<p>Some parts of Nietzsche is clearly not compatible with the transhumanist
<br>
perspective: the irrationalism and the idea of eternal return. The
<br>
irrationalism (which seems be partly dionysian, partly due to the
<br>
infinite perspectives) undermines the enlightenment foundations of
<br>
transhumanism, and without those transhumanism is another cult among
<br>
others. Similarly, the idea that everything happens again and again and
<br>
that progress is either a myth or something transient that has to be
<br>
followed by decline, runs counter to the essentially irreversible
<br>
character of transhumanism. We need reason, science, empiricism and the
<br>
belief in that we can progress to be transhumanists. Without them we
<br>
might still believe a lot of stuff, but we are not transhumanists by any
<br>
reasonable stretch of the term.
<br>
<p>Today we have a broad scepticism against anybody building systems in
<br>
philosophy - Nietzsche seems to be one source - but in the end we need
<br>
some kind of system or at least systematics if we want to structure our
<br>
beliefs about the world, thinking and acting in a way that promotes our
<br>
lives.
