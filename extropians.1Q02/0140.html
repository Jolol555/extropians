<em>&gt; &gt; Your point 3 contradicts your point 1, because you /do/ in fact want the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the possibly dangerous and violent situation for which you called him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) I don't want the policeman to carry a gun. I want him to clear the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation. I don't want someone shot dead, I want to drink my beer without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being threatened.
</em><br>
<p>And when the troublemakers are using knives, or, pray tell, illegally
<br>
obtained guns, what do you suppose your hypothetical unarmed policeman
<br>
is going to do? In colonial America (and Britain at the time), policemen
<br>
were unarmed but private citizens were armed, and police were required
<br>
to depend upon private citizens to back up his enforcement of the law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) I have explained in another mail why I consider a professional police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officer here (I've also explained the differences in training and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supervision) to be more competent than a wannabe hero with a gun.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with assertion (2) is that it supposes facts which
<br>
contradict the truth. In fact, an armed policeman in a given situation
<br>
is five times more likely to kill an innocent person (i.e. YOU, sitting
<br>
there drinking the beer) at any given crime scene than an armed private
<br>
citizen faced with the same situation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (3) Please look at the german crime statistics. German policemen use their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun very seldom:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Use of firearms by the german police in 1997 (the newest data I found):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    
</em><br>
<p>I could likewise say that in 1944, the german police used firearms on
<br>
hundreds of thousands of unarmed jews. Does the fact they didn't use
<br>
them on any law abiding German people make them right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.cilip.de/ausgabe/62/waffen.htm">http://www.cilip.de/ausgabe/62/waffen.htm</a>, sorry, only in german)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Total: 106 uses, 60 against persons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Bavaria, our most right-wing/&quot;law-and-order&quot; state, the secretary of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interior, Günther Beckstein, said in 2001: &quot;Thanks to the extensive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; de-escalative training of the Bavarian police, first all other coercives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the newly introduced pepper-spray are used, while the use of firearms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only the ultima ratio.&quot;[1]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is de-escalation a part of your concept of self-defense? Do the training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courses for self-defense with firearms in the US emphasize de-escalation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and consider the use of firearms only as ultima ratio? Or are we again at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of no-alternatives like in the Afghanistan discussion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germany has 80 mio. citizens. Our population density is 250 persons/sq km,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to 27 p/sq km in the US and &gt;250 in New York. We have far less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal weapons here and according to official estimations far less illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons than in the US. <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/gap.pdf">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/gap.pdf</a> is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting comparison between the legal systems, the prosecution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice of the US and Germany.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once again my question: Can you explain why the crime rates and use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firearms here is so much lower than in the USA? If it isn't the tech and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't the weapons, what magic is it then?
</em><br>
<p>Crime rates are lower for demographic as well as social reasons. Germans
<br>
have always been raised with serf mentalities with respect to the State.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the US is made up of the social rejects of every other
<br>
society (including Germany), so it shouldn't be surprising that violence
<br>
is generally higher here.
<br>
<p>However, one point of mine you have continuously refused to acknowledge:
<br>
the 'high violence' attributed to the USA is almost exclusively a
<br>
phenomenon of jurisdictions in the US which have gun laws that are even
<br>
more restrictive than that of Germany. Jurisdictions with loose gun laws
<br>
here in the US have low violence rates comparative to that of Germany,
<br>
when adjusted for demographic differences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You seem to have a typically European bias that somehow the policeman is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more qualified to &quot;play hero&quot; than other citizens, while the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tradition leans more toward self-reliance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question of &quot;bias&quot; mostly is a question of whom you ask... IMO, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;somehow&quot; can indeed be shown by comparing the education and training, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's another thread.
</em><br>
<p>The fact is that police are generally far less trained and skilled with
<br>
arms than private citizens who posess firearms. Police generally dislike
<br>
participating in public shooting competitions, and restrict access by
<br>
the public to their own qualifications tests. A good friend of mine, who
<br>
is a retired cop who ran qualifications for other cops for many years
<br>
can attest that police are generally poorly skilled in use of arms,
<br>
mostly dislike participating in their annual qualification shoots, and
<br>
many think that it is a point of pride that they've never fired their
<br>
guns outside of qualifications (even for simple practice at a range).
<br>
<p>There are of course exceptions to this, and those exceptions generally
<br>
tend to be excellent shooters. I've known quite a few such, and they
<br>
also have a low opinion of most of their fellow officers' gun skills.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Secondly, how do your feelings deal with the fact that technologies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the horizon that make a handgun seem like a child's toy?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;problem&quot; (if there is one) with firearms is no different from any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empowering technology: it empowers evil people to do more evil, and good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people to do more good--but since we fear the former, we restrict the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology which ends up limiting the latter.  The extropian ideal is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; create new and better technologies that empower the good guys more, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; keep ahead of the bad guys, and figure out what causes people to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bad guys and deal with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) What magic will take care, that the &quot;good guys&quot; (who defines &quot;good&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; btw?) will always be smarter and have the better tech?
</em><br>
<p>The magic is that there will always be more good people in the world
<br>
than bad people. Bad people, in my experience, constitute somewhere
<br>
around 3-10% of the population. The less able become criminals, the more
<br>
able go into government and politics with agendas of distrust for
<br>
others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) I've tried to shift the topic onto a more sociological level and a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global perspective, i.e. &quot;figure out what causes people to become 'bad'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys&quot;, but this either ended in &quot;tech will solve everything&quot; (how? why?) or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;don't know, I quit&quot; (the easy escape) or &quot;but handguns are okay&quot; (no real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument, regardless of no. of repetitions)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I feel the sheer horror when I think of, e.g. Mike Lorrey define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's &quot;good&quot; (from his point of view) and go around with a &quot;meme changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; device&quot; to brain wash everyone. No thanks. I don't even want one nation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define what is &quot;good&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>What is one nation but the collective opinion of some portion of its
<br>
inhabitants, either one, or some, or many, or most, or all? I think that
<br>
everyone here pretty much agrees that leaving the control to just one
<br>
person is a dumb, and therefore, bad, idea. I also think we can get a
<br>
general agreement that there are some things which are beyond the
<br>
ability or right of anyone or everyone to regulate, and that, therefore,
<br>
the idea of 'negotiated rights' is a dumb, and therefore, bad, idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard this argument before: &quot;The minorities&quot; are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; violent and criminal than the rest. (I won't discuss prejudices of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; police and justice here) It is sad to say that the numbers seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; confirm this theory, in the US as well as here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Mike said nothing of the sort, and nothing even remotely resembling this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems clear to me that you didn't even try to read and understand what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he did say, and this reflects very poorly on the value of anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might have to say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nice but unsubstantial rhetoric. The argument of the &quot;more violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minorities&quot; came from another author, that's right, I'm sorry. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompatible subcultures that lead to burning discos are not a sign of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peaceful society either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, what can we do to come to a peaceful society, not only in the US, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the world? If you ask me, it can not be the &quot;&lt;insert your favorite&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture for everyone&quot;, but only a balance of many.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is of trust, as I, and others, have written of so much in
<br>
the past, both on this list and on the web. This is a distinct problem,
<br>
because the human animal is not wired to trust just ANYONE implicitly.
<br>
We have evolved some measure of xenophobia, paranoia, and suspicion as a
<br>
survival instinct. We limit our trust not just to those we know to be
<br>
trustworthy, but to those who fit the profiles of those we know and
<br>
trust.
<br>
<p>It is for this reason that separate nations exist, why nationalism and
<br>
tribalism seem to increase at the same time, and proportionally, to the
<br>
degree to which communications and transportation technologies improve.
<br>
Nations which are less culturally homogenous will generally exhibit a
<br>
greater degree of strife and violence of various kinds than those which
<br>
are more homogenous. Similarly, societies which are based more on
<br>
concepts like order and subservience to the state are likely to be more
<br>
internally peaceful in the short term, but also more prone to mass
<br>
violence in the long term.
<br>
<p>While you can compare single years of data between the US and Germany,
<br>
the fact is that this is a disengenuous abuse of statistics. Proper use
<br>
requires comparison over longer terms, as well as a proper delineation
<br>
of jurisdictions. For example, over the entire 20th century, somewhere
<br>
between 2-5 million people died of violence in the US, while in Europe,
<br>
and Germany in particular, between 50-100 million people died in the
<br>
same period of violence, mostly due to the use of firearms, despite
<br>
living in a society where posession of firearms was highly regulated.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, of the violence that occured in the US in that period, 90%
<br>
of it occured in jurisdictions where the use of firearms was highly
<br>
regulated, if not banned outright. These violent jurisdictions are
<br>
generally characterized by a high preponderance of non-anglo immigrants
<br>
and descendants of freed slaves, demographic groups which were not lent
<br>
to trustworthiness by the WASP majority, nor originating from societies
<br>
where trust between individuals was particularly very strong.
