<p>Sorry.  MNT is Molecular Nanotechnology.  When I speak of &quot;robust&quot;
<br>
MNT, I'm usually refering to the kind that is capable of programmed
<br>
replication (one can avoid the self-replication nightmares) and
<br>
self-repair (internal recycling) as biological systems currently do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most people would also want an internet conneciton, and that would cost money.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't have to.  There are already situations in which groups
<br>
are putting together everything from line-of-sight high bandwidth
<br>
laser communications to distributed 3G wireless.  You are still
<br>
locked into paying the fiber providers for long haul, until one
<br>
can launch personal satellites into geosynchronous orbit or
<br>
a group bands together to install their own Iridium network.
<br>
<p>Remember is the *designs* that cost the money, not the materials
<br>
in the MNT era.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is also the problem with maintenance.  You don't really expect any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer left in an unoccupied building to remain running (or even present)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after a few years?  You would need security and maintenance people.
</em><br>
<p>Security perhaps.  But in an MNT era, when you don't have to get paid
<br>
to survive, would you be willing to provide the security simply for the
<br>
prestige?  (See some comments below before objecting please...)
<br>
You build the maintenance into the design.  One doesn't have to maintain
<br>
ones body &quot;much&quot;.  Once we can apply genome patches the maintenance will
<br>
be built into the program.  The same will be true for robust MNT designs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look at how expensive VCR's and CD's were.  Look at how many decades it took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be available to the public at all, let alone at a reasonable price.  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you expect uploading to be any different?
</em><br>
<p>Open source, people who don't have to &quot;work&quot; for a living who can devote
<br>
their full time to the project, philanthropists who are older for whom biomedical
<br>
technology may not be advancing may not be advancing fast enough, accumulating
<br>
wealth and cheaper technology, faster computers, etc.  By the time we
<br>
figure out how to do uploading, I don't expect there to be significant
<br>
material barriers to making it available to anyone who wants it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why?  More than half the people in the US and over 90% of the world can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even afford a PC-style computer.  Why do you think they will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford 3 Drexlerian nanocomputers?
</em><br>
<p>Half?  According to this (<a href="http://www.cmcnyls.edu/bulletins/USHPCJ97.HTM">http://www.cmcnyls.edu/bulletins/USHPCJ97.HTM</a>)
<br>
40.7% of households owned personal computers and that was in 1997!
<br>
When PCs become as cheap as cell phones, I think you will see many
<br>
more people using them.  The intermediate market of web-access-devices
<br>
(pads, phones, game consoles, etc. in the $100-$600 range) is already
<br>
bluring the &quot;PC&quot; concept and market penetration analysis.
<br>
<p>Everyone will be able to afford 3 DNC because the doubling time for MNT
<br>
is an hour (and thats conservative).  Society as a whole gets richer
<br>
based on the technology-base-growth-rate / population-growth-rate.
<br>
Say technology sophistication is growing at a rate of 10%/yr (or becoming
<br>
10% cheaper per year) while population is growing at 5%/yr.  Obviously
<br>
society as a whole is getting richer.  In fact as Kurzweil and others
<br>
document, the growth rates for many technologies is *much* faster than
<br>
10%/yr.  And that is still based on non-self-replicating systems or
<br>
rapid-assembly-line matter compilers.
<br>
<p>Here is the thing to think long and hard about.  We know nanotechnology
<br>
exists.  Every single person reading this has ~40 trillion nanoscale
<br>
&quot;biobots&quot; with &quot;foreign&quot; genomes operating on or within their body.
<br>
The doubling time for many of those biobots is ~20 minutes.  That
<br>
means that *if* you can supply them with sufficient matter and
<br>
energy, a single biobot can grow to the mass of the Earth in ~2 days.
<br>
Once such entitites become &quot;programmable&quot; then the economic base of
<br>
the planet shifts significantly -- precisely because the doubling
<br>
time for &quot;material wealth&quot; is much much less than the doubling time
<br>
for the human population.  If that doesn't make any sense to you,
<br>
then ask yourself this: &quot;Why can't I buy an inexpensive plot
<br>
of land and 'grow' my house?&quot;.  The answer of course is that
<br>
you can't currently go down to your hardware store and buy
<br>
a &quot;house-seed&quot;.
<br>
<p>The key thing to understand is that materials for biobots, C/H/O/N
<br>
are free for the taking from the atmosphere (a little P/S &amp; trace
<br>
metals may be required but the costs are minimal).  The other
<br>
essential element is energy.  That is free too if one has access
<br>
to sufficient sunlight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It costs millions to put something into Earth orbit.
</em><br>
<p>Not if you have the designs.  Someone commented at Extro4 I think
<br>
that Eric Drexler had once designed a rocket-suit that consumed
<br>
diamond &amp; oxygen as a fuel and you ended up in orbit in a skin
<br>
tight diamondoid space suit.  As has been discussed on the list
<br>
many times, the energy cost for putting a person into orbit isn't
<br>
significantly greater than flying from coast to coast.  Whether
<br>
you can fly into orbit every day depends entirely on how much
<br>
land you own to produce the energy to extract the CO2 from the
<br>
atmosphere and turn it into diamond fuel.
<br>
<p>[Side note to Spike or Doug -- which do you think is going to be
<br>
cheaper -- diamond fuel which you can keep at room temp or LH2 which
<br>
is lighter, but you either have to have heavier tanks to pressurize it
<br>
or have the extra expense of liquifying it?]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't even know if a private citizen CAN put something in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit around the sun.
</em><br>
<p>It simply costs more to get sufficient delta-V.  I believe it
<br>
isn't much of an increment over getting into orbit.  Spike or
<br>
Doug would know for sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can you object to &quot;It will cost money&quot; and then reply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;send yourself into orbit around the sun&quot;.  That's even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money than maintenance on earth would cost.
</em><br>
<p>There isn't any maintenance cost if its built into the designs
<br>
(other than the energy cost of taking your machines apart and
<br>
rebuilding them) -- but needn't be expensive.  Protiens in
<br>
bodies are constantly being recycled.  They may have half-lives
<br>
that range from &lt; 2 to &gt; 200 hours.  The reason to take yourself into
<br>
orbit is that you can position yourself much closer to the sun
<br>
and therefore gather much more energy with much less material.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd like to know where you get this &quot;free&quot; energy.  I could use it now, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before I upload.
</em><br>
<p>I think land in Texas can be had for $200-$300/acre -- though you might
<br>
have to buy it in large pieces.  Its very underutilized since a
<br>
majority of Texas is unprofitable from an agricultural perspective.
<br>
The best they can do with it is use it for grazing cattle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I could afford to put myself off of the earth, then yes, I wouldn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to worry about what earth laws say.  Unfortunately, I am not that wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yet).
</em><br>
<p>Ah but you will be -- *if* you can convince a bunch of your friends
<br>
to live on a diet of yogurt produced in a solar pond on the back 40
<br>
(probably the earliest application of food production using biobots)
<br>
and you slave away day and night at producing the open source designs
<br>
for the nanomachines that can produce your rocket-suit.  Perhaps you
<br>
can convince Doug or Spike to come help you work on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree.  However, that definitely will be one of the first hurdles.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  And its certainly going to have more than a few people scratching
<br>
their heads wondering what a &quot;human&quot; is...
