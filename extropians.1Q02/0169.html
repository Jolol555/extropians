re:&quot;Whilst the availability of guns in Chicago has become more
<br>
difficult, it is no difficulty for a determined individual, particularly a

criminal, to simply cross state lines &amp; purchase a gun in a state with more

<br>
<p>Ergo said states with more lax ownership &amp; sales restrictions should have

even more gun violence as well?

Subject: some US observations &amp; notes
<br>
<p><p>: In V6#364 &quot;Some US observations &amp; notes&quot; Brian D Williams said:
<br>
:
<br>
: &quot;Here in Chicago, handguns are completely illegal and have been for 20
<br>
years
<br>
: now.
<br>
:
<br>
: By the logic of the antigun folks, Chicago should by now be completely
<br>
free
<br>
: of handguns and violent crimes like murder should be non-existent. The
<br>
fact
<br>
: is that there are millions of handguns in the Chicago, 650+ murders this
<br>
: year, and gun related crime is an everyday occurrence in certain
<br>
: neighbourhoods.
<br>
:
<br>
: Yet the fact is (as any prosecutor here can tell you) is that the first
<br>
: thing that happens when an offender gets brought to court is that the
<br>
: weapons charges are usually dropped and the case is plea bargained.&quot;
<br>
:
<br>
: Brian, I can think of a few reasons why Chicago's crime situation is so
<br>
bad.
<br>
:
<br>
: 1. Whilst the availability of guns in Chicago has become more
<br>
: difficult, it is no difficulty for a determined individual, particularly a
<br>
: criminal, to simply cross state lines &amp; purchase a gun in a state with
<br>
more
<br>
: lax ownership &amp; sales restrictions. Gun restrictions will only really work
<br>
: if they are applied on a federal (or better yet international) level.
<br>
: Piece-meal approaches to gun restriction only seem to favour those who
<br>
will
<br>
: use such weapons for nefarious purposes.
<br>
: 2. The current US system of plea-bargaining seems to favour the
<br>
: more hardened criminal. Example: a street level dealer (or &quot;runner&quot;) is
<br>
: arrested. It is highly unlikely that he will have worthwhile information
<br>
on
<br>
: his superiors &amp; it is unlikely that he will be able to effect much change
<br>
in
<br>
: his charges by plea bargaining. Someone higher up the chain is arrested &amp;
<br>
: because they have more details on the overall supply system, they can
<br>
: effectively plea bargain a more serious supply charge away in exchange for
<br>
: that information. This is one of the reasons that the majority of people
<br>
in
<br>
: jail for drug offences (for example) are in for relatively minor offences
<br>
: (mandatory &quot;3 strikes&quot; sentencing doesn't help much either), &amp; the big
<br>
: sharks are still out in the community, doing maximum harm.
<br>
:
<br>
: I cannot claim to know what the best solution to the guns/crime problem in
<br>
: the US. The issues involved are difficult, the pressure from various
<br>
: interest groups so intense &amp; the size of the problem so large, that no
<br>
easy
<br>
: solution presents itself. To my mind the gun availability issue plays a
<br>
: major role in the problems that the US faces, however it is only one of
<br>
many
<br>
: issues that will need to be addressed if the US is to curb the horrific
<br>
rate
<br>
: of  violent crime that afflicts the majority of the united states.
