<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... and this is totally off-topic, but I think that someone should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write a book about the traveling adventures of government-stolen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art. Those Four Horses of St. Mark are now safely tucked away inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of San Marco's Basilica (the dummy horses are those displayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside!).. well the Venetians claimed that the horses were theirs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when Napolean stole them and then he gave them back, but the Venetians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stole them from Constantipole four hundred years earlier! And those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obelisks that Rome proudly displays now were stolen by Mussolini and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now Egypt wants them back. And there are those many Greek art pieces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the British Museum proudly displays as their own, which Greece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims were stolen and would really like to havve returned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p><p>I for one would definitley read such a book, sounds like it would be very
<br>
interesting.
<br>
<p>Here in New Zealand a lot of art sold (not stolen) by Maoris in the 19th
<br>
century is being returned.
<br>
SOme of the claims are just ridiculous- there was at one point a thriving
<br>
industry in
<br>
tattoed heads, war parties would capture slaves who were then tattoed with
<br>
the extensive and elaborate tattoos (moko)
<br>
which chiefs wore. The slaves were beheaded and the heads were then
<br>
exchanged for muskets, blankets etc.  Museums around the world are being
<br>
approached to return the heads, the way some tribal leaders today talk, it
<br>
is as if the Europeans captured Maori chiefs  and beheaded them themselves
<br>
to take the heads as souvenirs.  Even paintings and photographs of Maoris
<br>
are claimed by their descendants.  Artworks, carvings etc sold by 19th
<br>
century Maoris are being returned, but surely
<br>
once something is sold the artist (or his descendants) has no further right
<br>
to it? Opinions please?
