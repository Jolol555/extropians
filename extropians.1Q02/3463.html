<em>&gt; Thank you for the references.  Now I've got to find the time to look into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this some more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasn't thinking of making money by playing such a game, BTW, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along the lines of programming such a game.  You say it cost $1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get Everquest going?  Have they made this back?  What are their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financials - any idea?
</em><br>
<p>Hard to say, I don't think Verant are public. 300,000 people at $10/month is
<br>
not too shabby, however. But bear in mind that there are all sorts of major
<br>
maintenance costs associated with running an MMORPG; tech team, support
<br>
team, community building, monitors, billing, planned upgrades, etc, etc.
<br>
<p>I'm guessing at the $1,000,000 as being dev costs (typical scalable
<br>
high-traffic business app costs $250,000 to $500,000, and then the same
<br>
again for the graphics and clients and excessive testing associated with an
<br>
MMORPG). In reality it could be more, and certainly every upgrade released
<br>
by Verant probably topped $1,000,000 again.
<br>
<p>There are certainly a bunch of low-key, semi-single person or small crew
<br>
projects out there. The typical process is to build during an open alpha
<br>
test, acquire a community playing the game for free, then shop to a
<br>
publisher who will help you out with billing and distribution. That's how
<br>
Dark Space did it; having tried them out some time ago, I'd say they deserve
<br>
the success.
