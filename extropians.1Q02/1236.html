</em><br>
<p>Actually, Heinlein claimed that women didn't belong in combat because
<br>
they were typically more bloodthirsty than men once you got them to a
<br>
certain point (see Farnham's Freehold, Grumbles from the Grave, The Cat
<br>
Who Walks Through Walls, The Puppet Masters, among others). 
<br>
<p>However, I'm not sorry to see Verhoeven integrating basic training
<br>
(beyond just the shower scenes). I went through basic in 1988, when Air
<br>
Force basic training and technical training was integrated (though we
<br>
didn't bunk in the same rooms). While women were held to lower physical
<br>
standards than men (which is rather disgusting, considering how pathetic
<br>
Air Force physical standards were for men, even), technical standards
<br>
were equal. I did know a few women who were rather kick-ass who went out
<br>
for the Survival Instructors and Combat Controllers Schools with me, and
<br>
most of them were able to keep up with the hard core physical standards
<br>
set to get into those schools.
<br>
<p>Part of the reason for lower standards in training for women is because
<br>
they are held to lower physical standards in high school as well, so you
<br>
are starting off with lower caliber stock to begin with.
