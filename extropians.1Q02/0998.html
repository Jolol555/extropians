<p><p>There may be sarcasm but I think there is also a valid point.

People value their education because they value it.  Not because 
<br>
their parents slaved for it or because they did while attempting 
<br>
to simultaneously obtain it.  We need educated people a bit too 
<br>
much imho to insist everyone &quot;earn it&quot; in sweat if their parents 
<br>
or some other party doesn't show up to volunteer to pay for it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't generally like taxation.  But a tax that enabled all 
<br>
who are able and willing to go to college to do so would be one 
<br>
that I could at least see some good in.
