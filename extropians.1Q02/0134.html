<p>I'm cheering today. It's very convienient that when you drive 50 km you can 
<br>
still pay with the same currency. There are days when i travel i have to 
<br>
bring four wallets, and pay and receive in four different currencies, while 
<br>
speaking three or four languages, at least i can leave three wallets home now.
<br>
<p>In the cold war it was a common ennemy that forced the western european 
<br>
countries to come together and cooperate. I think that was initially 
<br>
replaced by a hope for stability and prosperity, but maybe there's also the 
<br>
aspect of ongoing european integration, which has simply made it more 
<br>
desireable for the europeans themselves. There are a lot of arguments for 
<br>
or against a european union. To me personally, most of the current european 
<br>
nation states are barely justifyable to begin with, most relying on medeval 
<br>
territorial claims of their hereditary monarchs, or a supposed nation-state 
<br>
idea, where the subjects are supposed to be &quot;one people&quot; based on common 
<br>
language, religion, culture. Reality is far from it, most of the countries 
<br>
historically have people within their borders that consider themselves part 
<br>
of the people of a neighbouring country, or a people on their own. A lot of 
<br>
countries have strong religious, language or cultural divide lines running 
<br>
straight through the middle (like belgium for instance, but in the 
<br>
netherlands there exists a similar north-south historical and cultural 
<br>
divide), and last but not least a lot of countries have people outside 
<br>
their borders (or entire countries) they feel historically or culturally 
<br>
related to.
<br>
<p>I think tourism, travel and business between these countries have made 
<br>
people realize they're not that much different from eachother, or at least 
<br>
not much more than from others, their nation state currently considers 
<br>
their country-men. Many of the countries share a common history, were once 
<br>
parts of eachother, or once considered to be the same people. Borders have 
<br>
changed throughout european history, the last time on large scale only a 
<br>
little more than half a century ago. A lot of europeans also have ancestors 
<br>
and relatives from and in other european countries.
<br>
<p>I can use myself as an example;
<br>
<p>I was born in Zealand Flanders, Netherlands. Around 1800 it would be 
<br>
Flandria, France, then Netherlands again, France, Spain, then Holy Roman 
<br>
Empire of Germany, etc. I know i have Dutch, Flemish, Walloon, French, and 
<br>
Swiss ancestors, and probably a lot more.
<br>
<p>I have 2 brothers, 1 sister, 1 stepbrother and 4 stepsisters, all born in 
<br>
the same area. One brother lives in Spain, and has a wife and son who speak 
<br>
Spanish, my stepbrother and me live in Belgium, my stepbrothers girlfriend 
<br>
is German. My other brothers girlfriend is Belgian (Flemish). My sister and 
<br>
stepsisters all live in the north of the Neterlands, and most have Dutch 
<br>
husbands. My fathers new lady friend is also German. I have worked for 
<br>
Dutch, Belgian, German and French employers, My mother has worked for a 
<br>
German company most of her life, my stepbrother also works for a German 
<br>
company.
<br>
<p>Maybe this can give you an idea how much europe has integrated already. I'm 
<br>
sure not every european has this kind of experience with the other 
<br>
countries, but it has become more normal than an exception. And i'm quite 
<br>
sure there were other periods in history (before nationalism, the nation 
<br>
state, and mercantilism) when the european borders were more open than they 
<br>
were say 20-30 years ago, both for trade and migration.
<br>
<p>Most of the objections that there could be against a large european &quot;united 
<br>
states&quot;-type state, can also be translated to the current nation states, 
<br>
what were the arguments for them ?, how do they justify the power and the 
<br>
borders ? I see a european state as something negative (much too large and 
<br>
powerful), but in many ways more positive than the current nation states. 
<br>
Because the transition of power away from the national governements goes in 
<br>
both directions, to the new european governement, but to an extent also to 
<br>
regional governements. I hope a bigger state will also mean more privacy to 
<br>
its citizens, and maybe a more efficient regional organization and 
<br>
infrastructure, based more on language and geographical barriers, And last 
<br>
but not least there's the convenience
<br>
aspect.
<br>
<p>I don't see much resistance against the european union (coming from within 
<br>
europe) from viewpoints other than nationalism or social &amp; economic 
<br>
protectionism,  and those political ideas i don't agree with. From a 
<br>
libertarian point of view i don't see how a political union that in many 
<br>
countries got voted on by referenda, can be a move down from states formed 
<br>
by nobles hereditary territorial claims, religion or by nationalist beliefs 
<br>
which were maybe never justifyable to begin with. I do see how a social &amp; 
<br>
economically protectionist european union is harmful to free trade outside 
<br>
that union, but i don't have objections against a further political union 
<br>
of the memberstates, that i don't have against those memberstates 
<br>
individually...
<br>
<p>Joost.
