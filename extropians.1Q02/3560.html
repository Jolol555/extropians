<em>&gt; I would personally think your first intuition was right. If you take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger view, seeing the monotheism as a product of writing makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense. While writing was invented &quot;around 4100-3800 BCE&quot; (Anders), one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may hypothesize that pre-monotheist creeds have existed for tens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tousands years or more before. (see below for some supporting arguments)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So OK, writing didn't instantly produce monotheism, but maybe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started/boosted a cultural process which in turn begat monotheism (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plato), which begat atheism (and materialism) -- which will beget the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity (maybe!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see it as a fairly linear world view development (no offence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended to religious people), in which writing is just instrumental.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Not &quot;linear&quot; as opposed to exponentional of course.)
</em><br>
<p>What evidence is there for this kind of development? There are certainly
<br>
a lot of cultural processes that are going on, how can we chack if the
<br>
processes we have experienced have been necessary (or likely) results of
<br>
preconditions such as writing, or just how it happened? 
<br>
<p>I do not quite agree that writing would lead to monotheism - just look
<br>
at China, where writing has been very prevalent but no major monotheist
<br>
religions have originated. I'm also unaware of any evidence for ancient
<br>
pre-monotheisms, unless one assumes the seed to be the remote high gods
<br>
in many nature religions.
<br>
<p>The issue isn't really religion here (although that is interesting), but
<br>
rather the determinism of history. Will the invention of the computer
<br>
inevitabily lead to the Internet and global freedom of information? Will
<br>
the introduction of writing lead to monotheisms? Will the introduction
<br>
of agriculture lead to the singularity? These are very relevant issues
<br>
to consider.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Plato's ideas (whether he invented them or rather crystalized them)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example were a great support for the development of Christianity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you imagine Plato without writing? In fact can you imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophizing (for best and worse) without writing?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think there were plenty of philosophers that never did
<br>
write. Compare to the various gnostic teachers that emerged later. But
<br>
writing empowers philosophers tremendously, both in spreading and
<br>
receiving ideas. But you could have a Christianity without Plato; a lot
<br>
of early Christianity doesn't seem to have been highly literate. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But forget Plato. A certain level of abstraction, and of persistence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thinking inside abstract domains, requires writing. And I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such practical capacity of abstraction may well naturally shape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surnatural beliefs into monotheism, while the absence of such capacity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brings you back to the real world and its diversity, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting idea, but China and Japan doesn't seem to support it at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another, negative argument I can think of is that writing boosts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of the natural world, and that this knowledge in turn favors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing in one unknowable God (like in islam, which is in fact, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you may note, the most recent), rather than seeing godlets and magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all over the place.
</em><br>
<p>Does it? I would not say the Mayans and Atztecs to be uninterested in
<br>
the natural world, but they didn't seem to be exploring it to the extent
<br>
found in Eurasia (outside certain areas such as astronomy, where they
<br>
were excellent). In fact, for most of the history of writing exploration
<br>
of the natural world has been very limited. I would rather say exploring
<br>
the natural world is more linked with a mindset that says it is a
<br>
worthwhile subject that can be understood, and that is a far more
<br>
cultural aspect than the existence of writing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would really like to know what happend 500-400 BCE - look at the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of extremely influential philosophers suddenly popping up worldwide; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;important greek ones in the West, Sun Tzu, Confucius, Buddha etc. Why so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;many at this time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe just because of some maturation stage consequent to the start of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing?
</em><br>
<p>Why in such a short time? Remember that the societies they lived in had
<br>
had writing for very different times and used very different writing
<br>
systems. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Exploring the logical space of world view is like that, too. When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get to a certain point, you are bound to ask the questions Plato
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked, etc., just like a child at a certain point of his development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (but not before) asks where children come from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it may be that Plato, though an &quot;extremely influential&quot; (Anders)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinker, is not quite as influential as one may think, but more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the web protocol. (Are you sure? -- Yes. -- All right.) What I mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, thinking that HTTP+HTML invention was something extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influential that begat all the web activity we see now is probably an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error. The web is more of an invention that had to happen at that time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that the development rate of the Internet could be maintained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is an internal logic in this development, an unfolding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities that are good, and begets the necessary &quot;inventions&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support it. (Think about Moore's law, too.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The logical space of worldview is not linear, but it has lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead-ends and places you simply cannot go rationnally (some lunatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may go there, but his thoughts will get lost). And it has one region
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which corresponds to the truth, or at least it has a truth gradient,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that we are probably somehow attracted to this place, and given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paths available, you don't have so many choices. So it ends up being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a linear path that unfolds with time. As you know, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dalai-Lama believes in the possibility of upload. :-)
</em><br>
<p>I think I understand your view, and to some extent it is of course true:
<br>
you cannot come up with universal laws of gravity unless you have other
<br>
examples of universal laws, mathematics and likely astronomy to provide
<br>
some objects of study. Hence they will occur subsequent to each other.
<br>
<p>But I'm not so convinced about the necessity in this process. Sometimes
<br>
cultures do not take &quot;obvious&quot; steps for a long time (like the wheel and
<br>
the mesoamericans) because the environment does not promote them.
<br>
Sometimes culture intervenes, like the long period of stasis imposed by
<br>
the Ming in China, and sometimes economics (slavery inhibiting
<br>
mechanisation in antiquity). These are all examples of cul de sacs. But
<br>
culture can also promote exploration of certain issues with great energy
<br>
(like astronomy has been strongly promoted in astrology-prone societies)
<br>
or lead to serependitious innovations (the discovery of lenses - leading
<br>
to telescopes, microscopes and optics - could have been done in
<br>
antiquity or china). The idea of linear progress inherent in
<br>
Christianity is sometimes said to have fuelled the expansion of the
<br>
west, and that is true. But what about the Orthodox church in the east,
<br>
and the Islamic world with its similarly linear view? Small differences
<br>
in interpretation - in several cases due to individuals and their power
<br>
games - caused them to behave far differently and give other priorities
<br>
to their cultures. 
<br>
<p>The big question is: how deterministic is history? We can be certain it
<br>
is not entirely deterministic - the tyfoon saving Japan from Chinese
<br>
invasion was in the end due to sensitive dependency on initial
<br>
conditions. We can also be certain it is not entirely random - as Jared
<br>
Diamond pointed out in _Guns, Germs and Steel_ there are noticeable
<br>
patterns in how different civilizations have evolved over huge amounts
<br>
of time and great geographical separation. Is there any way we can
<br>
decribe the exact amount of determinism? It is not so much a
<br>
quantitative issue as a qualitative one.
