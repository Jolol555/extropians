<p>&lt;&lt; I agree, but one has to ask what what level of &quot;proof&quot; would be
<br>
&nbsp;required that such nanobots do not exist.  To prove it demonstrably
<br>
&nbsp;in my mind, one would need to slice up the brains of every
<br>
&nbsp;individual on the planet at the 0.1-1 micron level and look
<br>
&nbsp;for signs of nanobots.  I don't see a high probability for people
<br>
&nbsp;rushing to sign up for this clinical trial.
<br>

<p>I am guessing that we would have uncovered astounding, anomalies, had such 
<br>
'unusal bacteria, prions, existed. There are lots of biologist who would have 
<br>
reported something 'very curious'. So far, no great surprises. When I first 
<br>
read Professor Walkers' proposal of the question,  the idea of the 
<br>
mitochondria inside the cells of just about everything living, might be such 
<br>
an anomaly. But why not just accept the more obvious argument, that this is 
<br>
an earthly, phenomena?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;This may be a subtle point, I'm not sure.  But obviously there is a
<br>
transition point between whether one wants to run the &quot;reality&quot; in a
<br>
virtual world or the physical world.  It depends largely, I think, on
<br>
how soon one would like to see the results and the granularity of the
<br>
simulations (finer granularity presumably has greater needs to move
<br>
into the real &quot;reality&quot;) and perhaps on an economic analysis of how
<br>
much of the available energy in the universe do you use to run
<br>
the simulation in a VR vs. reality (if one is looking at optimizing
<br>
ones long term resources).  In the visible universe, little optimization
<br>
seems to be taking place, so we are either in the real reality or one
<br>
constructed to appear as if the optimization of resource utilization
<br>
is of no concern.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I would argue that technically, it would seem that it would be easier 
<br>
producing a computer that runs a simulation, that merely moves electrons 
<br>
around in continuous off-on states, then it might be to slam 50 kilograms of  
<br>
matter, that may have been somehow, pre-programmed, and produce life, 
<br>
sensation, and intelligence. I could be wrong on this, but do not see how.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Its a numbers argument.  If &quot;perceived&quot; reality is a reflection of
<br>
&quot;real&quot; reality and in our &quot;real&quot; reality we can foresee the possibility
<br>
of running such simulations, then the odds are that we are one of
<br>
the simulations rather than the &quot;real&quot; reality (because the number
<br>
of simulations is much greater than the single reality).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well that certainly is logical. However, there are so many human example of 
<br>
performing projects that are anti-economical, like idiotic wars etc. To 
<br>
propose that this is a non-reality, must require some evidence, I would 
<br>
think. Carl Sagan also said that extrodinary claims require extrodinary 
<br>
evidence. Where is the red pill? (matrix-speak)
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I believe that it does matter that the Utility Fog does or does not enjoy its 
<br>
existence as it drifts amongst the stars, and that's what makes it all 
<br>
practical. If the Utility Foglet decided that human music is rather enjoyable 
<br>
to study, and imitate, then there is a practicality to existentialist 
<br>
cosmology. If a human being decides that She or He wishes to make their 
<br>
living as an Astronomer, and would not like being a Marketing Sales Rep, then 
<br>
there is a practical-ness to their choice of careers. Existential may indeed 
<br>
seemingly impact the practical. 
<br>
<p>Similarly, the Utility Fog may decide to pay the Solar System a friendly, 
<br>
vist (No Sunlight Blocking Please) and converse with the planets inhabitants 
<br>
via radio signal. It might exchange some useful information in a trade of 
<br>
music data for fusion power data, for example. Certainly, the earth's human 
<br>
population would have the existential experiences changed. 
<br>
<p>I do hope that Professor Walker also chimes in regarding this thread, but 
<br>
then it might serve him no practical use, or existential pleasure ;-)
