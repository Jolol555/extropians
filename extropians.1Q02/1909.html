<p>
<em>&gt; Obviously the intent of you asking these questions is very serious, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciated in a community such as this. But my opinion is if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious answers, then ask the question(s) seriously, being specific, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferably one question per conversation thread to start with.
</em><br>
<p><p>Thank you for your advice, and the references provided by some others. I will attempt to read on them, but for the moment, I would
<br>
like to continue this thread before it dries up.
<br>
<p>I had attempted to do the best of my abilities to ask people to consider this question: &quot;Why do we live, and continue living?&quot; From
<br>
the looks of the responses I think I had failed.
<br>
<p><p>I ask more probe-questions in the second mail because it seems like my main question cannot get through, and one should not construe
<br>
them as separate questions. I ask probe-questions not as implied goals but as questions. I want to know why and how, but so far I
<br>
had received unsatisfactorily answers.
<br>
<p>No matter what, I don't necessarily demand absolute answers. I would like people to consider this seriously, and not dismiss it with
<br>
the flick of the finger citing inconsistency, impossibility or perhaps just plain dismissal due to personal belief.
<br>
<p><p>If we do not have meta-goal type thinking to guide us, then how do we do things like formulating ethics and devising philosophy? I
<br>
would like to know this very much. Why do we do what we do, and what guides us to do so? What makes of think of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;,
<br>
&quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; and many other things?
<br>
<p>If we consider everything relative, then we can never condemn Hitler for gassing Jews nor praise Mother Theresa for helping the
<br>
unfortunate. So, why do we believe in progress, in freedom and in perusing the unknown? How can two nulls make a one?
<br>
<p><p>I wonder that perhaps here, we would encounter Gödel's Theorem again. How do we know that &quot;something is preferable over nothing
<br>
including even the experience of nothing&quot;? I don't want to know that we wish to survive, but for what reason do we even bother to
<br>
survive? I don't want to know about freedom, but why do we even survive and how do we know we should desire freedom. It seems like
<br>
when we have ignorance we have confusion, but when we have knowledge we have delusions. How do we transcend this?
<br>
<p>Taking the cue from <a href="http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/tmol-faq.html">http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/tmol-faq.html</a>, why do we get up in the morning? If we do so to experience
<br>
happiness, to increase knowledge and to contribute to altruism, which will lead to a better universe, then how do we know we have a
<br>
better universe. How would such a universe differ from our own? Why would we decide that we should target this &quot;better&quot;?
<br>
<p><p>Would a sentient intelligence do better than us even if it converted the entire universe into computing substrate? One day it would
<br>
have to stop existing, even if we put the day of reckoning away by migrating to other universes accidents can still happen, and
<br>
given eternity, the probability of any improbable event happening will eventually go to one.
<br>
<p>Knowing our long-term mortality, what do that do then? If we will have to die some day, then why do we live? [Please avoid viewing
<br>
this from a &quot;pessimistic&quot; point but maintain a neutral one.] Does our happiness, knowledge and other things really matter? Do we
<br>
really have freedom?
<br>
<p><p>Why should we seem to fear unfamiliar thinking like this? Surely, we would like to boldly go where no one has gone before. Why do
<br>
some of us dismiss the possibility of existential meta-goals? Did we ever consider why we &quot;should&quot; to progress, to live forever, to
<br>
build sentient computers and millions of other possibilities that we can barely catch a glimpse that future technology allows us?
<br>
<p><p>Maybe my writings still cannot convey my question adequately. For that I offer my apologies. I hope someone can help clarify in such
<br>
a case. Meanwhile, I would like to advise on avoiding making personal attacks on this potentially sensitive topic.
<br>
<p>I hope this helps.
