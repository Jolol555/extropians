<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=RE:%20Use%20of%20closed%20source%20software">hal@finney.org</a> wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; In my experience the degree of review provided by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the open source community is haphazard, random and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spotty.  Just publishing software as open source is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no guarantee that anyone will review its security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flaws closely.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  But having closed source guarantees that interested parties cannot
<br>
review its security flaws closely.  It also prevents the customer from
<br>
verifying security, and they end up having to assume or trust the vendor
<br>
with no evidence of security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my opinion and experience, a far more effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method is to pay for an independent review by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security experts.  I would rather trust a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closed source program which has been given a clean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill of health by a review team I trust than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has been published on sourceforge.net
</em><br>
<p>You are exactly right.  I was sloppy in my statements.  By &quot;open source&quot;, I
<br>
meant reviewed by third parties not involved with the development effort.
<br>
These independent experts do not have to be the public at large, but they
<br>
should not be the same company that developed the product.  You do get what
<br>
you pay for, and merely publishing source without ensuring that a proper
<br>
review is performed will not accomplish anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore there is the risk that publishing software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source code will give more information to the bad guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow them to design exploits.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree here.  Security by obscurity does not work.  A closed source
<br>
application with many security holes will get abused more than an open
<br>
source application with few security holes.  If source code is published
<br>
(and actually reviewed, as you point out), it will have most security holes
<br>
fixed.  If a few slip by the experts, they will be fewer than the obvious
<br>
holes in some closed source applications.  Microsoft has closed-source
<br>
software, and its holes are well-known and often exploited.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sadly, this is often a greater motivation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identifying security holes than an altruistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to improve the quality of someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software.
</em><br>
<p>I don't mind this.  Instead of relying on altruism to get security comments
<br>
back, we can trust that some people will selfishly scrutinize code to find
<br>
any minor flaw just to be able to brag about it.  This is a more dependable
<br>
motivation for free feedback.  They will work more diligently for their own
<br>
reward rather than for the code owner's benefit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The people for whom security is a life and death matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the military and spy agencies, do not publish their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal software as open source.  I believe they share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the belief that doing so is not the optimal way to secure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their software.  They rely on internal reviews, attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teams, and closed source.
</em><br>
<p>I have extensive experience in reviewing and testing such classified
<br>
software.  It is often riddled with obvious design flaws that were
<br>
overlooked because there was not enough peer review of the software.
<br>
Although the military will never go to the open-source model, they are
<br>
increasingly requiring independent review by experts not connected with the
<br>
development effort.  They are learning that too much closed-door development
<br>
actually reduces security.
<br>
<p>Your main point about hiring security experts and not just expecting the
<br>
public to debug open-source code for free, is exactly right on.  Open source
<br>
by itself does not guarantee any security.  An independent security review
<br>
by experts is what is required.
