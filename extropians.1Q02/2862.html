</em><br>
<p>I don't consider that to be the case.  If one reads Nanosystems
<br>
and Eric's other papers carefully there are a huge number of
<br>
other things discussed.  A few would include -- the problems
<br>
of constructing molecules with strained bonds, the damage UV
<br>
radiation causes to molecules, the rather fantastic number
<br>
of structures that can be constructed within a cube measuring
<br>
100 atoms per side, the fact that heat removal is the *real*
<br>
problem for high computation densities, the fact that one has
<br>
to move from non-reversible to reversible computational
<br>
architectures, the fact that there is a clear chemical/biotechnology
<br>
based path to assemblers by designing molecular parts of increasing
<br>
stiffness, etc.
<br>
<p>The fact that SRAs can exist is obvious to anyone who understands
<br>
biology.  Eric's extension of this to general purpose assemblers
<br>
is a significant contribution but I wouldn't consider it *that*
<br>
significant.  Its only significant from the perspective that
<br>
he pointed out the risks that such devices could pose and that
<br>
gets everyone who isn't aware of the existing &quot;green goo&quot; situation
<br>
all upset.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; probably by tacitly ignoring it when dealing with those with

</em><br>
<p>You don't have to ignore it at all.  You simply point out there
<br>
are *very* effective ways of dealing with the risks, e.g. heat and
<br>
radiation.  Those are the same methods that have been used to deal with
<br>
the green goo for ages.  It is unfortunate that people generally lack
<br>
the knowledge to paint a complete picture -- that you can have
<br>
assemblers that are non-self-replicating that can rely on
<br>
broadcast architectures and that the people who promote the
<br>
dangers of SRGPA do not in the same breath acknowledge we are
<br>
effectively already in that situation *and* there are defenses that
<br>
can be employed should we choose to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Calculating the consequent risks &amp; goal drifts requires craft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Argue, or win the war?
</em><br>
<p>Educate, avoid annoying people as best you can and prepare to
<br>
defend oneself.
