<p>FIRST GENETIC EVIDENCE UNCOVERED OF HOW MAJOR CHANGES
<br>
IN BODY SHAPES OCCURRED DURING EARLY ANIMAL EVOLUTION
<br>
<p><p><p><a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/mchox.htm">http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/mchox.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p>Biologists at the University of California, San Diego have uncovered the
<br>
first genetic evidence that explains how large-scale alterations to body
<br>
plans were accomplished during the early evolution of animals.
<br>
<p>In an advance online publication February 6 by Nature of a paper scheduled
<br>
to appear in Nature, the scientists show how mutations in regulatory genes
<br>
that guide the embryonic development of crustaceans and fruit flies allowed
<br>
aquatic crustacean-like arthropods, with limbs on every segment of their
<br>
bodies, to evolve 400 million years ago into a radically different body
<br>
plan: the terrestrial six-legged insects.
<br>
<p>The achievement is a landmark in evolutionary biology, not only because it
<br>
shows how new animal body plans could arise from a simple genetic mutation,
<br>
but because it effectively answers a major criticism creationists had long
<br>
leveled against evolution=8Bthe absence of a genetic mechanism that could
<br>
permit animals to introduce radical new body designs.
<br>
<p>=B3The problem for a long time has been over this issue of macroevolution,=B2
<br>
says William McGinnis, a professor in UCSD=B9s Division of Biology who headed
<br>
the study. =B3How can evolution possibly introduce big changes into an
<br>
animal=B9s body shape and still generate a living animal? Creationists have
<br>
argued that any big jump would result in a dead animal that wouldn=B9t be abl=
<br>
e
<br>
to perpetuate itself. And until now, no one=B9s been able to demonstrate how
<br>
you could do that at the genetic level with specific instructions in the
<br>
genome.=B2
<br>
<p>The UCSD team, which included Matthew Ronshaugen and Nadine McGinnis, showe=
<br>
d
<br>
in its experiments that this could be accomplished with relatively simple
<br>
mutations in a class of regulatory genes, known as Hox, that act as master
<br>
switches by turning on and off other genes during embryonic development.
<br>
Using laboratory fruit flies and a crustacean known as Artemia, or brine
<br>
shrimp, the scientists showed how modifications in the Hox gene Ubx=8Bwhich
<br>
suppresses 100 percent of the limb development in the thoracic region of
<br>
fruit flies, but only 15 percent in Artemia=8Bwould have allowed the
<br>
crustacean-like ancestors of Artemia, with limbs on every segment, to lose
<br>
their hind legs and diverge 400 million years ago into the six-legged
<br>
insects.
<br>
<p><p><p>=B3This kind of gene is one that turns on and off lots of other genes in orde=
<br>
r
<br>
to make complex structures,=B2 says Ronshaugen, a graduate student working in
<br>
William McGinnis=B9 laboratory and the first author of the paper. =B3What we=B9ve
<br>
done is to show that this change alters the way it turns on and off other
<br>
genes. That=B9s due to the change in the way the protein produced by this gen=
<br>
e
<br>
functions.=B2
<br>
<p>=B3The change in the mutated protein allows it to turn off other genes,=B2 says
<br>
William McGinnis, who discovered with two other scientists in 1983 that the
<br>
same Hox genes in fruit flies that control the placement of the head, thora=
<br>
x
<br>
and abdomen during development are a generalized feature of all animals,
<br>
including humans. =B3Before the evolution of insects, the Ubx protein didn't
<br>
turn off genes required for leg formation. And during the early evolution o=
<br>
f
<br>
insects, this gene and the protein it encoded changed so that they now
<br>
turned off those genes required to make legs, essentially removing those
<br>
legs from what would be the abdomen in insects.=B2
<br>
<p>The UCSD team=B9s demonstration of how a mutation in the Ubx gene and changes
<br>
in the corresponding Ubx protein can lead to such a major change in body
<br>
design undercuts a primary argument creationists have used against the
<br>
theory of evolution in debates and biology textbooks. Their specific
<br>
objection to the idea of macroevolutionary change in animals is summed up i=
<br>
n
<br>
a disclaimer that the Oklahoma State Textbook Committee voted in November,
<br>
1999 to include in that state=B9s biology textbooks:
<br>
<p>=B3The word evolution may refer to many types of change. Evolution describes
<br>
changes that occur within a species. (White moths, for example, may evolve
<br>
into gray moths). This process is microevolution, which can be observed and
<br>
described as fact. Evolution may also refer to the change of one living
<br>
thing into another, such as reptiles and birds. This process, called
<br>
macroevolution, has never been observed and should be considered a theory.=B2
<br>
<p>=B3The creationists=B9 argument rests in part on the fact that animals have two
<br>
sets of chromosomes and that in order to get big changes, you=B9d need to
<br>
mutate the same genes in both sets of chromosomes,=B2 explains McGinnis. =B3It=B9=
<br>
s
<br>
incredibly unlikely that you would get mutations in the same gene in two
<br>
chromosomes in a single organism. But in our particular case, the kind of
<br>
mutation that=B9s in this gene is a so-called dominant mutation, so you only
<br>
need to mutate one of the chromosomes to get a big change in body plan.=B2
<br>
<p>The discovery of this general mechanism for producing major leaps in
<br>
evolutionary change has other implications for scientists. It may provide
<br>
biologists with insights into the roles of other regulatory genes involved
<br>
in more evolutionarily recent changes in body designs. In addition, the
<br>
discovery in the UCSD study, which was financed by the National Institute o=
<br>
f
<br>
Child Health and Human Development, of how this particular Hox gene
<br>
regulates limb development also may have an application in improving the
<br>
understanding human disease and genetic deformities.
<br>
<p>=B3If you compare this gene to many other related genes, you can see that the=
<br>
y
<br>
share certain regions in their sequences, which suggests that their functio=
<br>
n
<br>
might be regulated like this gene,=B2 says Ronshaugen. =B3This may establish
<br>
how, not only this gene, but relatives of this gene in many, many different
<br>
organisms actually work. A lot of these genes are involved in the
<br>
development of cancers and many different genetic abnormalities, such as
<br>
syndactyly and polydactyly, and they may explain how some of these
<br>
conditions came to be.=B2=A0
