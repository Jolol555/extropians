<p><em>&gt; Louis, *you're* doing it again.  Right now diamond is expensive.

<em>&gt; Nanotechnology produces diamond as a waste product.  If you convert

<em>&gt; carbon in its other forms into diamond, you get a large amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy *out* of the chemical reaction.  That's why diamonds are so
</em><br>
<p>Depositing pure diamond in small increments is very expensive
<br>
energetically. Doesn't matter, of course, energy is basically free. As
<br>
long as you don't melt the site...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; hard - you have to expend that amount of energy, add it back in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before you can break the molecular bonds.
</em><br>
<p>Um, most stable allotrope of carbon at normal conditions is graphite. If
<br>
you have a few (ten) GYears spare time, you can watch a diamond slowly
<br>
decay into graphite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you look at a description of a diamondoid space suit and protest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that not even Bill Gates could afford it, you are applying your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twentieth-century expectations to a surface description of the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You take this one concept, &quot;space suit made of diamonds&quot; (which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't; &quot;diamondoid&quot; isn't the same thing at all), and then applying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the twentieth-century concept that diamonds are expensive, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concluding that nobody can afford the space suit.  But the concept
</em><br>
<p>If you can make such a suit, you don't have to. Because &quot;people&quot; no longer
<br>
need it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; doesn't exist in isolation.  Along with the concept of a diamondoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space suit goes the concept of diamond, not as expensive rocks dug up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the ground, but as a waste material produced by exothermic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exoergic nanotech manufacturing processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you do have with nanotechnology is the diamondoid recycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.  As I pointed out at the last Foresight Gathering when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic of recycling came up, &quot;a diamond is not forever&quot;, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably more efficient to disintegrate it - take the energy output of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a power plant or a solar mirror and run the diamondoid material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through en masse - rather than disassembling it atom-by-atom, as I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard proposed.
</em><br>
<p>Diamonds burn just fine. Better than graphite, in fact, in terms of
<br>
enthalpy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking of which, Robert, are you sure that it's possible to consume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diamond and oxygen as a fuel?  Are you sure you aren't thinking of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rocket-suit that got you into orbit by turning something else, maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acetylene, into the diamondoid suit?
</em><br>
<p>The reason diamonds are difficult to light is because they're excellent
<br>
conductors of heat (in fact, only buckys anisotropically conduct better
<br>
than isotopically pure diamond), so you need to heat them uniformly, and
<br>
of course the usual scale applies. You *could* fire a charcoal brazier
<br>
with brilliants, though.
