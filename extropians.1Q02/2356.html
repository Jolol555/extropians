It should always be a red flag when your ideological preferences are in
<br>
alignment with your beliefs about an objective but controversial issue
<br>
like global warming.  An ideology is a useful tool but a terrible master.
<br>
In the interests of constructing an accurate view of the world, you must
<br>
be suspicious of easy and comfortable beliefs which conform with your
<br>
preferences.  In the long run, basing your life on falsehoods about the
<br>
world is dangerous.  Better to expend the mental energy to objectively
<br>
study issues even when they contradict your pet beliefs.
<br>
<p>For a quick overview of the scientific consensus, I recommend last
<br>
year's report on Climate Change Science by the National Research Council.
<br>
It is available online at <a href="http://search.nap.edu/books/0309075742/html/">http://search.nap.edu/books/0309075742/html/</a>.
<br>
The report is only 29 pages and begins with a 5 page summary.  Appendix B
<br>
includes biographies of the contributors which should put to rest any
<br>
contention that these are brainwashed government flunkies.  They are in
<br>
fact respected scientists with strong credentials, many of them members
<br>
of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences.
<br>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the summary, reviewing the earlier report by
<br>
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):
<br>
<p>&quot;The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50
<br>
years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas
<br>
concentration accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific
<br>
community on this issue.  The stated degree of confidence in the IPCC
<br>
assesesment is higher today than it was 10, or even 5 years ago, but
<br>
uncertainty remains because of (1) the level of natural variability
<br>
inherent in the climate system on time scales of decades to centuries,
<br>
(2) the questionable ability of models to accurately simulate natural
<br>
variability on those long time scales, and (3) the degree of confidence
<br>
that can be placed on reconstructions of global mean temperature over the
<br>
past millennium based on proxy evidence.&quot;
<br>
<p>In my opinion, denying that human-caused global warming is the
<br>
consensus of the scientific community is putting our heads in the sand.
<br>
It represents the worst case of letting oneself be ruled by an ideology
<br>
rather than vice versa.  The reason we have scientists is so that
<br>
people can spend their entire lives becoming expert on questions such
<br>
as these.  Refusing to accept their conclusions because they contradict
<br>
our ideological beliefs is irrational.  No Extropian should allow his
<br>
mind to mislead him in this way.
<br>
<p>For reference, a critical analysis of the NRC report by
<br>
the libertarian Reason Public Policy Institute is online at
<br>
<a href="http://www.rppi.org/rr103.html">http://www.rppi.org/rr103.html</a>.  IMO this simply excerpts the caveats
<br>
and uncertainties listed in the NRC report, hoping to present bait which
<br>
will attract sympathetic ideologies.  A careful reading of the NRC report
<br>
reveals that strong statements like the above are made in the context
<br>
of the uncertainties which the report describes.  In other words, even
<br>
though the impact of human actions on warming &quot;cannot be unequivocally
<br>
established&quot;, nevertheless the consensus of the scientific community is
<br>
that there is a link.  All the cautions and concerns that the Reason
<br>
people highlight do nothing to change the stated conclusions of the
<br>
report.  Science is never certain, but the Reason people wave around the
<br>
report's cautionary language as though that invalidated its conclusions.
<br>
