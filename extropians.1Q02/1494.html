<em>&gt; &gt; i've been smoking off and on since i was about fifteen (four years,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;And forget the
<br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Actually I have a couple of questions about this...if someone is using a
<br>
psychological map of reality which relies on 'ceremony' to achieve a
<br>
particular mental state, and the resulting mental state is positive, surely
<br>
the ceremony is worthwhile even as a placebo effect?
<br>
<p>My second question: some years ago I met a young woman in research who was
<br>
bright, cheerful, fit and smoked about twenty a day. Encouraged by the
<br>
efforts of others, she decided to quit. Within two weeks she was a depressed
<br>
nervous wreck who couldn't handle socialising at all. Once bright, she now
<br>
seemed to find it difficult to think, could not concentrate, and developed
<br>
nervous habits.She remained like this, often suicidal and visiting her
<br>
doctor for medication. Then she started smoking again. The symptoms
<br>
disappeared, and she returned to her old 'normal' self. Intrigued, we asked
<br>
if she would be willing to have tests relating to this. It turned out she
<br>
was permanently deficient in acetylcholine and various other
<br>
neurotransmitters unless she smoked.
<br>
What I am asking is: How many other people suffer from this to a lesser
<br>
degree, and, are they the ones who have the greatest difficulty giving up
<br>
smoking?
<br>
<p>Having said all this, I do think the method outlined below is probably the
<br>
best one.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; How to Quit Smoking:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   1) Don't smoke another cigarette, ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's that simple. No, it's not easy, but it's not that hard either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first day will be the hardest, but each day it gets easier. Try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to substitute eating or drinking for smoking: as always, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should eat right, exercise, and drink in moderation. Reward yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by buying a book, going to a movie, or spending your savings on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorite hobby or a membership at a fitness club.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be strong.
</em><br>
