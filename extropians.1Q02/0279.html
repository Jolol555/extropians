<em>&gt; Was your post about Heinlein, evidence that he seemed to see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;singularity&quot; on the horizon? If so, neither his atomic war, nor a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of accelerated technical progress actually occurred. Houses in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1946 look much as houses did then, autos are gasoline powered, there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a computer in every home, but surely not robots. No lunar colonies, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heinlein predicted, and outside of NERVA (1968), no atomic powered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spaceships.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heinlein may be beloved as a visionary, but his visions have nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with accuracy (a chore in itself!). So therefore, based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heinlein's lack of success in forecasting, perhaps a Singularity, much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later, rather then much sooner?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the error of Heinlein and his contemporaries was assuming that
<br>
the extreme change would be in the world of transportation rather than
<br>
information. Not that there wasn't a revolution in transportation as
<br>
well. Keep in mind that in 1946, air transportation was limited to
<br>
government officials and the wealthy, and the quality of transportation
<br>
was rough, slow, and uncomfortable. Civil transports flew at 200-300
<br>
mph, usually unpressurized and with poor heating and high incidence of
<br>
turbulence with small planes. Man still had not penetrated the sound
<br>
barrier, the fastest military planes still flew under 600 mph.
<br>
Today, more people fly on airliners than had previously used trains, at
<br>
a lower cost, and with a comfort and speed that SF writers only dreamt
<br>
of in 1946. Military and civilian vehicles have flown into space, to the
<br>
moon (Heinlein's prediction of a first moon landing actually was within
<br>
just a year or two of the real event), and he accurately forecast the
<br>
sort of impact that interstate highways would have on society and land
<br>
planning.
<br>
What Heinlein and his contemporaries failed to forecast was the enormous
<br>
economic drain that both the Cold War AND the 'War on Poverty' would
<br>
have, how this negatively impacted the level of investment in space
<br>
exploration following the Apollo era, and how the loss in Vietnam would
<br>
impact the national self-confidence for so long, and he did not, in
<br>
1946, forecast the sort of market manipulation the OPEC cartel could use
<br>
to cripple the world economy for years.
<br>
Heinlein severely underestimated the development of computer technology,
<br>
expecting the world to continue to use magnetic tapes even after the
<br>
year 2100, and did not expect true AI to develop until after the year
<br>
3000.
<br>
He also expected homes to look much the same in the future as they did
<br>
then, with simply more automation, and his visions of such were set far
<br>
in our own future.
<br>
<p>I personally expect us to catch up to and exceed Heinlein's predictions
<br>
within a few decades. You must keep in mind that his idea of 'massive
<br>
change' is certainly not what you or I would consider such. He was born
<br>
in 1910, the same year as my grandfather. I'd hardly expect someone of
<br>
that era to look at our current day and not see our 'normality' as
<br>
representing &quot;The Crazy Years&quot;. My 89 year old grandmother certainly
<br>
sees these days as such.
